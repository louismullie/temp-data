## Question

definition of oliguria

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the definition of oliguria. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the current consensus definition and its origin. Then, I should verify how oliguria is used within AKI frameworks and staging. Next, I will examine the physiological rationale and limitations of the 0.5 mL/kg/h threshold. After that, I should review emerging evidence proposing stricter thresholds and shorter durations. Finally, I will synthesize a clinically grounded definition and highlight special populations and practical considerations, making sure I double-check areas of controversy and cite appropriately throughout.

> Let me first confirm the consensus definition. Oliguria is most commonly defined in adults as urine output less than 0.5 mL/kg/h for at least 6 consecutive hours, a threshold embedded in KDIGO and widely adopted in research and practice, and this is the standard against which most studies compare alternative thresholds and durations [^aa6cd44d] [^39fdb0ec].

> Wait, let me verify the historical rationale before I accept it at face value. The 0.5 mL/kg/h cut-off traces back to older physiological data suggesting that when GFR is normal, urine output below about 0.35 mL/min (roughly 21 mL/h in a 70 kg adult) implies reabsorption of more than 99.5% of glomerular filtrate, which operationalized the concept that such low flows reflect maximal concentration and likely pathologic reduction in GFR rather than normal variability [^32be2055] [^90a3c7ad].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about clinical utility. I need to check how oliguria functions within AKI frameworks. KDIGO integrates oliguria alongside creatinine changes to diagnose and stage AKI: stage 1 by UO less than 0.5 mL/kg/h for 6 hours, stage 2 by less than 0.5 mL/kg/h for 12 hours, and stage 3 by less than 0.3 mL/kg/h for 24 hours or anuria for 12 hours, underscoring that both magnitude and duration matter for prognostication [^39fdb0ec] [^aa6cd44d].

> I should confirm the limitations of the 0.5 mL/kg/h threshold. Multiple large observational cohorts show that this definition is highly sensitive but nonspecific, capturing many patients with transient, physiologic oliguria and yielding high false-positive rates for subsequent creatinine-defined AKI; for example, in perioperative cohorts, oliguria alone increased AKI incidence dramatically without clear mortality signal, and in ICU cohorts, short oliguria episodes often do not predict creatinine-AKI, highlighting poor positive predictive value [^d9c00d82] [^3ce3ee9d] [^ebd5c897] [^b719abe3].

> Let me consider the physiological context more carefully. Oliguria can reflect appropriate renal conservation in hypovolemia or stress states, and tubular concentrating ability may be impaired in intrinsic injury, so urine output can be preserved despite falling GFR, meaning oliguria may be a late or inconsistent marker of true renal injury; this complexity argues for interpreting oliguria alongside hemodynamics, fluid status, and other biomarkers rather than in isolation [^8fd1c3dc] [^c93d3729] [^010cc0c0].

> Next, I should review emerging evidence for stricter thresholds. Several large ICU cohorts suggest that lower thresholds and shorter windows improve prognostic discrimination: for example, less than 0.2 mL/kg/h for 6 hours identified a higher-risk subgroup with substantially higher 90-day mortality, and severe oliguria less than 0.1 mL/kg/h for 3 hours has been linked to creatinine-AKI and mortality; similarly, 0.3 mL/kg/h for 6 hours has repeatedly outperformed 0.5 mL/kg/h for predicting adverse outcomes, indicating a dose–response relationship with both severity and duration of oliguria [^7fd7b865] [^3825685c] [^9e7149ed] [^0a8aaf76] [^c6950e3d].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the 0.3 mL/kg/h threshold was uniformly superior across all time windows; let me verify the time dimension. Evidence shows that shorter windows can detect risk earlier but may trade specificity for sensitivity, whereas longer windows improve specificity; the optimal balance appears to be around 3–6 hours for severe oliguria and 6–12 hours for moderate reductions, with some studies finding that 4 consecutive hours of oliguria best discriminates subsequent creatinine-AKI, reinforcing that duration modifies prognostic value substantially [^b719abe3] [^643e4914] [^9e7149ed].

> I need to ensure I address special populations. In pediatrics, neonatal and infant AKI definitions often use higher UO thresholds (for example, less than 1.0–2.0 mL/kg/h) because of developmental tubular immaturity and higher obligate water losses, and recent neonatal data suggest that even relative oliguria below 1.5–2.0 mL/kg/h is associated with mortality, supporting age-appropriate thresholds rather than direct extrapolation from adult cutoffs [^a2301a4a] [^823ee23d] [^89f9d448].

> Let me think about practical measurement issues that could distort definitions. Accurate hourly UO requires indwelling catheters and reliable nursing documentation, and normalization to body weight raises questions about actual versus ideal weight, especially in obesity or cachexia; studies show that using ideal body weight can reduce overdiagnosis of oliguria and strengthen associations with outcomes, so I should double-check which weight metric was used when interpreting incidence data [^306c4d20] [^fb65d8e2] [^010cc0c0].

> But wait, what if oliguria is transient or diuretic-responsive; does that change its meaning. Transient oliguria, particularly resolving within 24–48 hours, has been associated with better outcomes than persistent oliguria, and randomized data in hemodynamically stable oliguric patients suggest that routine fluid boluses to "treat" oliguria may increase fluid accumulation without clear renal benefit, supporting a cautious, context-driven approach rather than reflexive volume loading [^33e290ce] [^47dbf5ca] [^7da96fa9].

> I should double-check the clinical implications for AKI staging and triage. Oliguria-based AKI frequently reclassifies patients to higher stages than creatinine alone, and UO stages 2–3 independently associate with higher 90-day mortality even after adjustment for creatinine stage and illness severity, which means oliguria should trigger closer monitoring, evaluation of prerenal factors, and consideration of early nephrology involvement even when creatinine is unchanged [^04831979] [^92216358] [^1e3d81d5].

> Let me synthesize a clinically useful definition. For adults, oliguria should be defined as urine output less than 0.5 mL/kg/h for at least 6 consecutive hours, with the caveat that risk stratification improves when we recognize more severe oliguria: less than 0.3 mL/kg/h for 6–12 hours or less than 0.2 mL/kg/h for 3–6 hours identifies higher-risk patients, while durations shorter than 6 hours may be prognostically informative but carry lower specificity and should be interpreted in clinical context alongside hemodynamics, fluid balance, and other biomarkers [^aa6cd44d] [^7fd7b865] [^9e7149ed] [^b719abe3].

> Hold on, I should verify that I'm not overstating causality. Oliguria is best viewed as a risk marker and a window into renal perfusion and tubular function rather than a disease itself; its predictive value depends on severity, duration, and the clinical setting, so I need to ensure we avoid equating oliguria with inevitable AKI and instead use it to guide timely assessment of prerenal, intrinsic, and postrenal causes while avoiding iatrogenic fluid overload [^c93d3729] [^8fd1c3dc] [^23123f00].

---

Oliguria is defined as **urine output < 0.5 mL/kg/h for 6 hours** [^aa6cd44d] in adults, which is the KDIGO threshold for AKI risk [^39fdb0ec]. Anuria is **< 100 mL/day** or essentially no urine output. These thresholds guide early detection of AKI and risk stratification in critical illness [^92216358], but oliguria can reflect prerenal physiology or tubular injury, so interpretation must be contextualized with hemodynamics, fluid status, and creatinine trends [^8fd1c3dc] [^c93d3729]. Shorter durations or lower thresholds (e.g. < 0.3 mL/kg/h for 6–12 h) identify higher-risk patients [^9e7149ed] [^7fd7b865], yet oliguria alone has modest predictive value for AKI, especially when transient [^b719abe3] [^d9c00d82].

---

## Standard definition of oliguria

According to KDIGO, **oliguria is < 0.5 mL/kg/h for 6 hours** [^aa6cd44d]; this is the most widely used definition in clinical practice and research [^696013c1]. Anuria is **< 100 mL/day** or essentially no urine output.

---

## Physiological basis of oliguria

Oliguria reflects reduced GFR and increased tubular reabsorption, often from **prerenal hypoperfusion** or **intrinsic tubular injury** [^8fd1c3dc]. Prerenal causes include hypovolemia, hypotension, and low cardiac output, whereas intrinsic causes include acute tubular necrosis, interstitial nephritis, and glomerulonephritis [^3aed8928]. Postrenal obstruction can also cause oliguria or anuria [^8fd1c3dc].

---

## Clinical significance of oliguria

Oliguria is a key **early marker of AKI** and is associated with worse outcomes, including higher mortality, longer ICU stay, and increased need for RRT [^92216358] [^04831979]. However, oliguria is sensitive but nonspecific; many episodes are transient and do not progress to creatinine-defined AKI [^b719abe3] [^d9c00d82].

---

## Limitations and controversies

- **Transient oliguria**: Short-lived oliguria is common in critical illness and may not indicate true renal injury [^b719abe3] [^d9c00d82].
- **Fluid status**: Oliguria can reflect appropriate renal conservation in hypovolemia, complicating interpretation [^8fd1c3dc] [^010cc0c0].
- **Body weight**: Weight-based thresholds can misclassify obese or edematous patients; ideal body weight may improve accuracy [^fb65d8e2] [^306c4d20].
- **Diuretics**: Loop diuretics can mask oliguria, reducing specificity [^0380416f] [^a07f0344].

---

## Alternative definitions and thresholds

Recent studies propose stricter thresholds to improve prognostic accuracy:

| **Threshold** | **Duration** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|-|
| < 0.3 mL/kg/h | 6–12 hours | Strongly associated with AKI, RRT, and mortality [^9e7149ed] [^0a8aaf76] |
| < 0.2 mL/kg/h | 3–6 hours | Identifies high-risk patients with increased mortality [^7fd7b865] [^3825685c] |
| < 0.1 mL/kg/h | 3 hours | Severe oliguria linked to poor outcomes [^9e7149ed] [^0a8aaf76] |

---

## Clinical approach to oliguria

- **Immediate assessment**: Evaluate hemodynamics, volume status, and obstruction [^405c5ac8].
- **Diagnostic tests**: Urinalysis, electrolytes, creatinine, and imaging (ultrasound) to distinguish prerenal, intrinsic, and postrenal causes [^405c5ac8].
- **Management**: Treat underlying causes; avoid excessive fluids unless hypovolemic; consider early nephrology for persistent oliguria or AKI [^23123f00] [^3bb364c5].

---

Oliguria is defined as **< 0.5 mL/kg/h for 6 hours** and signals potential AKI, but its predictive value depends on duration, severity, and clinical context. Stricter thresholds and integrated assessment improve risk stratification and guide timely intervention.

In the context of the critically ill patient, the onset of consistent oliguria is an ominous sign that requires immediate attention. Without intervention, intermittent oliguria may turn into persistent oliguria or evolve to acute kidney injury (AKI), with severe associated morbidity and mortality. Whether the addition of urine output to the serum creatinine criteria permits earlier and more specific detection of AKI is controversial, but current evidence supports its importance in early diagnosis and management.

Key Points

Question

What is the contribution of the oliguria-based Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria to diagnosis, severity assessment, and outcomes in acute kidney injury (AKI)?

Findings

In this cohort study of 15 620 patients admitted to an intensive care unit, consideration of oliguria-based criteria, in addition to those based on serum creatinine levels alone, enabled identification of AKI or an increase in its severity in 51.7% of critically ill patients. Moreover, oliguria-based stages 2 and 3 AKI appeared to be statistically significantly associated with 90-day mortality after correction for serum creatinine level, comorbidities, and illness severity.

Meaning

These findings suggest that oliguria, as defined by the KDIGO criteria, is associated with mortality in AKI and should be accounted for by clinicians at the bedside and clinical researchers while designing trials.

Proposal for a new definition of oliguria

Based on these findings, we propose to consider a minimum average UO of < 0.2 ml/kg/h for 6 h as the new threshold to define oliguria. In our cohort, 24.7% [95% CI 24.0–25.4] of the patients fulfilled these revised criteria for oliguria (vs 73.0% [95% CI 72.3–73.8]) for consensus criteria). Unlike consensus criteria, this stricter definition is significantly associated with a higher 90-day adjusted mortality (OR 1.98 [95% CI 1.57–2.49] vs 1.27 [95% CI 0.95–1.70]). As shown in Fig. 2, patients with a minimum average UO of < 0.2 ml/kg/h for 6 h had a lower 3-month survival compared to other groups of patients throughout categories of illness severity and age, and this persisted at 12 months, (Additional file 1: Figure S11).

Introduction

Regardless of the exact criteria used to define it, oliguria is often observed in critically ill patients, and yet there are many questions regarding its clinical relevance and impact on outcomes. Reduced urine output can be a physiological response or a reflection of altered tissue perfusion or renal dysfunction.

Although urine output is now widely used as one of the criteria for the diagnosis and staging of acute renal failure, there are relatively few studies that have specifically assessed urine output or oliguria as a marker of acute renal failure or outcomes in general populations of intensive care unit (ICU) patients. The clinical importance of oliguria likely depends on its duration. For example, a 1-h period of oliguria during an emergency admission is less important than if the symptom persists for longer periods, when it is more likely to reflect impaired renal function.

To provide some global insight into the impact of oliguria and its persistence on outcomes in general ICU patients, we reviewed the large, international Intensive Care over Nations (ICON) database to evaluate the occurrence of oliguria and its association with the need for renal replacement therapy (RRT) and mortality.

### Identification of an optimal threshold to define oliguria in critically ill patients: an observational study [^3825685c]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The relevance of current consensus threshold to define oliguria has been challenged by small observational studies. We aimed to determine the optimal threshold to define oliguria in critically-ill patients.

Methods

Cohort study including adult patients admitted within a multi-disciplinary intensive care unit between January 1st 2010 and June 15th 2020. Patients on chronic dialysis or who declined consent were excluded. We extracted hourly urinary output (UO) measurements along with patient's characteristics from electronic medical records and 90-day mortality from the Swiss national death registry. We randomly split our data into a training (80%) and a validation (20%) set. In the training set, we developed multivariable models to assess the relationship between 90-day mortality and the minimum average UO calculated over time windows of 3, 6, 12 and 24 h. Optimal thresholds were determined by visually identifying cut-off values for the minimum average UO below which predicted mortality increased substantially. We tested models' discrimination and calibration on the entire validation set as well as on a subset of patients with oliguria according to proposed thresholds.

Results

Among the 15,500 patients included in this analysis (training set: 12,440, validation set: 3110), 73.0% (95% CI [72.3–73.8]) presented an episode of oliguria as defined by consensus criteria (UO < 0.5 ml/kg/h for 6 h). Our models had excellent (AUC > 85% for all time windows) discrimination and calibration. The relationship between minimum average UO and predicted 90-day mortality was nonlinear with an inflexion point at 0.2 ml/kg/h for 3 and 6 h windows and 0.3 ml/kg/h for 12 and 24 h windows. Considering a threshold of < 0.2 ml/kg/h over 6 h, the proportion of patients with an episode of oliguria decreased substantially to 24.7% (95% CI [24.0–25.4]). Contrary to consensus definition, this threshold identified a population with a higher predicted 90-day mortality.

Conclusions

The widely used cut-off for oliguria of 0.5 ml/kg/h over 6 h may be too conservative. A cut-off of 0.2 ml/kg/h over 3 or 6 h is supported by the data and should be considered in further definitions of oliguria.

Implications for clinicians and policy makers

Our data provide an explanation for the perceived lack of relevance of oliguria as defined by a minimum average UO of less than 0.5 ml/kg/h for 6 h. Indeed, this definition appears to be too liberal and to include many patients for which oliguria has no prognostic implication. By considering UO as a continuous predictor of 90-day mortality, we propose to revise the current definition of oliguria and use 0.2 ml/kg/h for 6 h as a cut-off. Our data further suggests that such cut-off might be applied indifferently to patients with medical and surgical (emergent and elective) admissions despite the fact that these populations have very different baseline adjusted mortality rates.

Furthermore, we show that an increased mortality can already be identified when averaging UO over 3 h while using the same cut-off for oliguria (< 0.2 ml/kg/h). Using a time window of three hours to monitor urine output may thus allow early identification of patients at risk of excess mortality.

### Identification of an optimal threshold to define oliguria in critically ill patients: an observational study [^90a3c7ad]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Urinary output (UO) is the most obvious and accessible window to renal function in the intensive care unit (ICU). It is a major component of acute kidney injury (AKI) diagnosis and staging. Low UO (oliguria) is associated with 90-day mortality irrespective of changes in serum creatinine (sCr). However, the interpretation of oliguria remains a daily challenge for clinicians throughout the world who struggle to differentiate a physiological adaptation to stress from kidney damage. According to consensus definition, a urinary output of less than 0.5 ml/kg/h for a minimal duration of 6 h defines AKI[1]. This threshold is based on old physiological data demonstrating that urine was maximally concentrated when its volume output fell below 0.35 ml/min (21 ml/h).

The clinical relevance of this definition, however, has recently been challenged. In a series of > 3500 patients, intra-operative episodes of oliguria defined by a UO between 0.3 and 0.5 ml/kg/h were not associated with post-operative AKI but only those defined by a UO < 0.3 ml/kg/h. In 239 critically ill patients, oliguria, defined by a cut-off of 0.5 ml/kg/h for > 4 h, had a very low positive predictive value (11%) for AKI (defined as an increased serum creatinine). In 725 critically ill patients, a threshold of 0.3 ml/kg/h for 6 h outperformed the current definition to predict mortality or the need for dialysis. Those findings were confirmed in a larger cohort study conducted in Finland, where, compared to standard thresholds, stricter (< 0.3 ml/kg/h for 6 h or < 0.1 ml/kg/h for 3 h) cut-offs increased the predictive values of oliguria for 90-day mortality.

Hence, the current definition of oliguria appears too conservative. However, the best cut-off to define oliguria remains to be determined. We aimed to define the best time weighted intensity cut-offs for UO to predict 90-day mortality in critically ill patients. Accordingly, we designed a retrospective observational study to assess the association between the minimum average UO and 90-day mortality, to identify potential cut-offs in this relationship and to assess their clinical relevance.

Conclusions

In this large observational study, we confirmed that the current consensus threshold of 0.5 ml/kg/h over 6 h to define oliguria may be too conservative. A cut-off of 0.2 ml/kg/h over 3 or 6 h is supported by the data and should be considered in further definitions of oliguria.

### Association of oliguria with acute kidney injury diagnosis, severity assessment, and mortality among patients with critical illness [^04831979]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Importance

The current definition and staging of acute kidney injury (AKI) considers alterations in serum creatinine (sCr) level and urinary output (UO). However, the relevance of oliguria-based criteria is disputed.

Objective

To determine the contribution of oliguria, as defined by the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria, to AKI diagnosis, severity assessment, and short- and long-term outcomes.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study included adult patients admitted to a multidisciplinary intensive care unit from January 1, 2010, to June 15, 2020. Patients receiving long-term dialysis and those who declined consent were excluded. Daily sCr level and hourly UO measurements along with sociodemographic characteristics and severity scores were extracted from electronic medical records. Long-term mortality was assessed by cross-referencing the database with the Swiss national death registry. The onset and severity of AKI according to the KDIGO classification was determined using UO and sCr criteria separately, and their agreement was assessed.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Using a multivariable model accounting for baseline characteristics, severity scores, and sCr stages, the association of UO criteria with 90-day mortality was evaluated. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess how missing sCr, body weight, and UO values, as well as different sCr baseline definitions and imputations methods, would affect the main results.

Results

Among the 15 620 patients included in the study (10 330 men [66.1%] with a median age of 65 [IQR, 53–75] years, a median Simplified Acute Physiology Score II score of 40.0 [IQR, 30.0–53.0], and a median follow-up of 67.0 [IQR, 34.0–100.0] months), 12 143 (77.7%) fulfilled AKI criteria. Serum creatinine and UO criteria had poor agreement on AKI diagnosis and staging (Cohen weighted κ,0.36; 95% CI, 0.35–0.37; P < .001). Compared with the isolated use of sCr criteria, consideration of UO criteria enabled identification of AKI in 5630 patients (36.0%). Those patients had a higher 90-day mortality than patients without AKI (724 of 5608 [12.9%] vs 288 of 3462 [8.3%]; P < .001). On multivariable analysis accounting for sCr stage, comorbidities, and illness severity, UO stages 2 and 3 were associated with a higher 90-day mortality (odds ratios, 2.4 [95% CI, 1.6–3.8; P < .001] and 6.2 [95% CI, 3.7–10.5; P < .001], respectively). These results remained significant in all sensitivity analyses.

Conclusions and Relevance

The findings of this cohort study suggest that oliguria lasting more than 12 hours (KDIGO stage 2 or 3) has major AKI diagnostic implications and is associated with outcomes irrespective of sCr elevations.

### Oliguria as predictive biomarker of acute kidney injury in critically ill patients [^0d8b9113]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Urine output monitoring is almost universal in critically ill patients worldwide. Historically, maintenance of urine output has been regarded as being synonymous with the preservation of renal function and decreases in urine output regularly prompt a variety of clinical interventions with the aim of preventing or attenuating acute kidney injury (AKI). According to this paradigm, after exclusion of obstruction, decreased urine output is considered a clinically useful biomarker of decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which occurs before the detectable accumulation of biochemical markers of AKI. As a result, consensus definitions of AKI have incorporated urine output criteria alongside biochemical markers of renal excretory function. Unfortunately, this step has occurred despite a lack of any prospective data in critically ill patients associating the magnitude and duration of oliguria with subsequent changes in serum biochemistry. In addition, urine output criteria used in consensus definitions have ignored the potential value of shorter periods of oliguria.

It is important to note that Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, End-Stage (RIFLE) and Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) consensus definitions of AKI incorporate lengthy periods of oliguria (6, 12, and 24 hours) by which time significant renal injury may have already occurred. Consequently, much shorter durations of oliguria, such as two hours or less, have been recommended and are often used as targets for therapeutic intervention. It is uncertain, however, how many patients experiencing shorter periods of oliguria are at significant risk of biochemical AKI defined by creatinine criteria (AKI-Cr). Furthermore, it is unclear how sensitive any duration of oliguria is at identifying AKI-Cr given that urine output can be relatively preserved even when GFR is significantly impaired. Accordingly, we hypothesized that oliguria would only be a poor to fair predictive biomarker of subsequent AKI-Cr. To test this hypothesis, we performed a prospective multicenter observational study of the relation between oliguria and subsequent AKI-Cr in a cohort of critically ill patients in seven centers worldwide.

### Acute kidney injury [^58d65a0f]. Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Diagnosis and classification of acute pathology in the kidney are major clinical problems. Azotemia and oliguria represent not only disease but normal responses of the kidney to extracellular volume depletion or decreased renal blood flow. Changes in urine output and glomerular filtration rate are therefore neither necessary nor sufficient for the diagnosis of renal pathology. However, no simple alternative for the diagnosis currently exists. By examining both glomerular and tubular function, clinicians routinely make inferences not only on the presence of renal dysfunction but also on its cause. However, pure prerenal physiology is unusual in hospitalized patients, and its effects are not necessary benign. Sepsis, the most common condition associated with acute renal failure in the intensive care unit, may alter renal function without any characteristic changes in urine indices, and classification of these abnormalities as prerenal will undoubtedly lead to incorrect management decisions. The clinical syndrome known as acute tubular necrosis does not actually manifest the morphologic changes that the name implies. A precise biochemical definition of acute renal failure has never been proposed, and until recently, there has been no consensus on the diagnostic criteria or clinical definition. Depending on the definition used, acute renal failure has been reported to affect from 1% to 25% of intensive care unit patients and has led to mortality rates ranging from 15% to 60%. From this chaos, two principles emerged: first, the need for a standard definition and, second, the need to classify the severity of the syndrome rather than only consider its most severe form. The RIFLE criteria were developed to achieve these goals, and the term acute kidney injury has been proposed to encompass the entire spectrum of the syndrome, from minor changes in renal function to requirement for renal replacement therapy. Thus, acute kidney injury is not acute tubular necrosis, nor is it renal failure. Small changes in kidney function in hospitalized patients are important and are associated with significant changes in short-term and possibly long-term outcomes. The RIFLE criteria provide a uniform definition of acute kidney injury and have now been validated in numerous studies.

### Association of oliguria with acute kidney injury diagnosis, severity assessment, and mortality among patients with critical illness [^fb767aee]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Acute kidney injury (AKI) has been proposed to encompass the entire range of acute alterations in kidney function, from transient oliguria to severe loss of function. According to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines, AKI is defined as an increase in serum creatinine (sCr) levels relative to a baseline value and/or a decrease in weight-adjusted hourly urinary output (UO). Both components are deemed readily available at the bedside, are reproducible, and are assumed to have equivalent prognostic capacities.

The added value of oliguria over sCr level, however, is challenged, particularly if it is only transient and not associated with an increase in sCr level. Most studies reporting AKI outcomes have solely relied on sCr criteria or have applied modified/simplified UO criteria. Indeed, sCr levels are regularly monitored in hospitalized patients and can easily be retrieved through electronic medical records. Hence, sCr-based staging is straightforward and can even trigger bedside e-alerts. In contrast, KDIGO criteria for oliguria are relatively complex and cumbersome. They require hourly UO monitoring, the presence of an indwelling catheter, and reconciling UO documentation with precise time frames (6, 12, and 24 hours). Furthermore, UO criteria rely on the correct estimation or documentation of patients' body weight, a notoriously poorly documented parameter.

### Urine output on an intensive care unit: case-control study [^a345e17b]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Statistical analyses

The exposure of main interest was oliguria as a binary variable. A commonly accepted definition of oliguria is a urine output < 0.5 ml/kg for each of six or more consecutive hours, which is thought to confer "risk" of renal injury; when urine output < 0.5 ml/kg persists for 12 or more consecutive hours, the kidneys are designated to be "in injury". Use of this definition of oliguria was possible for controls, as their urine output was measured hourly, but lack of routine catheterisation of doctors on shift meant that hourly output data were not available for cases. We therefore defined oliguria for both cases and controls as a mean urine output < 0.5 ml/kg/hour over a period of six or more hours of measurement.

The sample size was calculated to allow detection of an association between being oliguric and being an intensive care unit doctor. Assuming three controls per case and a 25% prevalence of oliguria in controls, we anticipated requiring 410 case days to detect an odds ratio of 1.5. The unit of analysis was a stratum consisting of one day's data from a case (doctor) and one day's data from each of one or more matched controls (patients). Oliguria was evaluated in terms of the odds ratio of being a case, relative to being a control, on any given day. Our secondary analysis looked for a "dose response effect", investigating whether urine output analysed as a continuous variable tended to be lower in cases than in controls. Both analyses used conditional logistic regression, matching on stratum. To allow for the presence of some of the cases in multiple strata, we inflated standard errors using the "sandwich" estimator; we did not, however, adjust for the presence of the same controls in multiple strata on different days. We performed our analyses in Stata version 11 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA).

### Oliguria as predictive biomarker of acute kidney injury in critically ill patients [^ebd5c897]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Significance of study findings

Our study provides the only prospective multicenter assessment of oliguria in ICU to date. It shows that oliguria is, at best, only a fair predictor of subsequent AKI-Cr. Notably all short durations of oliguria (< 12 hours) were associated with positive likelihood ratios for AKI-Cr of only two to four. This finding suggests that the presence of these durations of oliguria during a given day does not usefully increase the post-test probability of AKI-Cr the next day, because, in general, a likelihood ratio of more than 10 is considered necessary for a clinically useful test.

Oliguria of 12 hours or more was associated with a high enough likelihood ratio to have clinical utility, in part validating its use in the RIFLE-Injury urine output definition. However, use of this cut-off would result in missing a large majority of cases of AKI-Cr. These observations are important because identifying patients at risk of developing AKI-Cr is the first and necessary step for clinicians to decide which patients should receive specific treatment and which patients should be observed. The crucial importance of these distinctions is supported by evidence that fluid resuscitation might reduce renal dysfunction, but that iatrogenic fluid overload can worsen outcomes and the prognosis of AKI. In addition, the early identification of patients at risk is vital because intervention only after biochemical evidence of AKI has developed (increased sCr) is likely to be too late. These clinical challenges are further complicated by the likelihood that the transition to renal dysfunction will not be abrupt. This gradual transition from appropriate physiological salt and water retention to injury is reflected in the limited diagnostic utility of urinary biochemistry in the early diagnosis of AKI the ICU.

Oliguria as a measure of kidney function — Oliguria generally reflects a decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and when GFR is normal (approximately 125 ml/min; approximately 107 ml/kg/h for a 70-kg adult), a urine volume < 0.5 ml/kg/h implies reabsorption of more than 99.5% of glomerular filtrate; oliguria is unusual with a normal GFR, and if GFR and serum creatinine (SCr) are normal and stable over 24 hours, measuring urine flow is generally not necessary to assess kidney function.

### The urine output definition of acute kidney injury is too liberal [^5e441bb5]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Urine output is a rapid bedside test for kidney function, and reduced output is the oldest known biomarker for acute kidney injury (AKI); historically described by Galen (200 CE). A rapid reduction of urine output may be the earliest indication of decreased kidney function. The Risk, Injury Failure, Loss, End stage (RIFLE) consensus definition of the Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative used urine output < 0.5 ml/kg/hour for ≥ 6 hours to define AKI. Subsequent AKI definitions have retained this criterion.

The urine output criterion (oliguric AKI) consistently classifies more patients as presenting AKI than the creatinine criteria. Mortality is higher in those with oliguric AKI compared with those without AKI. However, little is known about the comparative mortality for the creatinine criteria verse urine output criteria for AKI. Wlodzimirow and colleagues in a study of 260 patients note that the mortality rate for AKI diagnosed by creatinine alone was greater than for those diagnosed by either creatinine or urine output. Cruz and colleagues noted that AKI defined by urine output was not an independent predictor of mortality. Three studies have investigated the duration of oliguria in relation to creatinine or mortality. Oliguria (< 0.5 ml/kg/hour) of any duration between 1 and 12 hours was only a fair predictor of subsequent development of AKI according to the RIFLE creatinine criterion, and mortality rates increased with increasing duration of oliguria. To our knowledge, no study has attempted to define an optimum urine output threshold and duration of collection for AKI diagnosis.

We aimed to determine the ideal urine output threshold and collection duration by comparing various thresholds and durations with a predefined composite clinical outcome, namely death or need for dialysis.

### Oliguria is an early predictor of higher mortality in critically ill patients [^9f22dcd1]. Kidney International (2011). Low credibility.

Oliguria is a valuable marker of kidney function and a criterion for diagnosing and staging acute kidney injury (AKI). However, the utility of urine output as a specific metric for renal dysfunction is somewhat controversial. To study this issue further we tested whether urine output is a sensitive, specific, and early measure for diagnosing and staging AKI in 317 critically ill patients in a prospective observational study. Urine output was assessed every hour and serum creatinine every 12 to 24 h. The sensitivity and specificity of different definitions of oliguria for the diagnosis of AKI were compared with the Acute Kidney Injury Network serum creatinine criterion. The incidence of AKI increased from 24%, based solely on serum creatinine, to 52% by adding the urine output as a diagnostic criterion. Oliguric patients without a change in serum creatinine had an intensive care unit mortality rate (8.8%) significantly higher than patients without AKI (1.3%), and similar to oliguric patients with an increase in serum creatinine (10.4%). The diagnosis of AKI occurred earlier in oliguric than in non-oliguric patients. Oliguria of more than 12 h and oliguria of 3 or more episodes were associated with an increased mortality rate. Thus, urine output is a sensitive and early marker for AKI and is associated with adverse outcomes in intensive care unit patients.

### Oliguria in the ICU. systematic approach to diagnosis and treatment [^010b5329]. Anesthesiology Clinics of North America (2000). Low credibility.

Perioperative oliguria is common but rarely implies acute renal failure. We should interpret oliguria as a sign of intravascular hypovolemia and treat it as prerenal until proven otherwise. On the other hand, the absence of oliguria does not exclude acute renal failure. The most reliable clinical indicator of progressive renal dysfunction is a serial decline in creatinine clearance estimation, a measure of glomerular filtration rate.

### Targeting oliguria reversal in perioperative restrictive fluid management does not influence the occurrence of renal dysfunction: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^e5c4b87c]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Interest in perioperative fluid restriction has increased, but it could lead to hypovolaemia. Urine output is viewed as a surrogate for renal perfusion and is frequently used to guide perioperative fluid therapy. However, the rationale behind targeting oliguria reversal - achieving and maintaining urine output above a previously defined threshold by additional fluid boluses - is often questioned.

Objective

We assessed whether restrictive fluid management had an effect on oliguria, acute renal failure (ARF) and fluid intake. We also investigated whether targeting oliguria reversal affected these parameters.

Design

Systematic review of randomised controlled trials with meta-analyses. We used the definitions of restrictive and conventional fluid management as provided by the individual studies.

Data Sources

We searched MEDLINE (1966 to present), EMBASE (1980 to present), and relevant reviews and articles.

Eligibility Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials with adult patients undergoing surgery comparing restrictive fluid management with a conventional fluid management protocol and also reporting the occurrence of postoperative ARF.

Results

We included 15 studies with a total of 1594 patients. There was insufficient evidence to associate restrictive fluid management with an increase in oliguria [restrictive 83/186 vs. conventional 68/230; odds ratio (OR) 2.07; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.97 to 4.44; P = 0.06; I = 23.7%; Nstudies = 5]. The frequency of ARF in restrictive and conventional fluid management was 20/795 and 20/799, respectively (OR 1.07; 95% CI, 0.60 to 1.92; P = 0.8; I = 17.5%; Nstudies = 15). There was no statistically significant difference in ARF occurrence between studies targeting oliguria reversal and not targeting oliguria reversal (OR 0.31; 95% CI, 0.08 to 1.22; P = 0.088). Intraoperative fluid intake was 1.89l lower in restrictive than in conventional fluid management when not targeting oliguria reversal (95% CI, -2.59 to -1.20l; P < 0.001; I = 96.6%; Nstudies = 7), and 1.63l lower when targeting oliguria reversal (95% CI, -2.52 to -0.74l; P < 0.001; I = 96.6%; Nstudies = 6).

Conclusion

Our data suggest that, even though event numbers are small, perioperative restrictive fluid management does not increase oliguria or postoperative ARF while decreasing intraoperative fluid intake, irrespective of targeting reversal of oliguria or not.

### Definition of hourly urine output influences reported incidence and staging of acute kidney injury [^13be5c25]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

The value of using UO to detect AKI may be dependent on the method used to define oliguria, as average UO can differ according to how it is measured and recorded. In most clinical situations, particularly where patients are not catheterised, UO is measured as volume of urine produced over a given period, from which average hourly urine output can be calculated. In critical care environments UO is usually recorded hourly, making it possible to identify each hour where the urine output falls below the KDIGO threshold and whether this persists over consecutive hours. KDIGO acknowledge that there is no consensus on whether UO should be measured using consecutive hourly readings or mean output over a fixed period of time. The method used can affect reported incidence of AKI and sensitivity/specificity of UO as a diagnostic test. It is important to understand the impact that this could have on the reliability of UO for diagnosing AKI. Consistency in definition of UO and oliguria is important. Existing studies have been limited by focusing on single populations and have not considered potential variation across other clinical settings in which AKI is common.

As a retrospective analysis of two single-centre observational studies to investigate novel urinary biomarkers, we investigated patients admitted to cardiac intensive care (CICU) following cardiac surgery or to a general intensive care unit (ICU) to establish if differing methods of measuring UO affected reported incidence of AKI, stratified by stage (Stage 1–3). SCr was used as 'gold-standard' for categorising AKI. We calculated sensitivity and specificity for each method to ascertain if either method was preferable in a given clinical setting.

### Oliguria as predictive biomarker of acute kidney injury in critically ill patients [^f8516db6]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

The concepts described above have been transferred almost unaltered into the RIFLE and AKIN contemporary consensus definitions of AKI. In these systems, urine output of less than 0.5 ml/kg/hr for 6 or 12 hours is used to identify mild or intermediate kidney injury (RIFLE R or I; AKIN 1 or 2) and a urinary output less than 0.3 ml/kg/hr for more than 24 hours or anuria for more than 12 hours is taken to identify more severe AKI (RIFLE F; AKIN 3). The accuracy and usefulness of this urinary classification in real world clinical contexts, however, remains poorly understood. More relevant to this study, many other factors may modify the relation between urine output and GFR in critical illness. For example, in both acute and chronic renal disease, urinary concentrating capacity is often impaired and urinary concentrating capacity is directly related to the kidney's ability to reduce urea clearance in relation to GFR. Thus, although GFR may be significantly lower, the ability to generate a low volume of urine may be impaired. In these circumstances, a decline in GFR will ultimately result in a decrease in urine output, which may only meet conventional definitions of oliguria at very low levels of GFR making sustained oliguria a late and not early indicator of AKI. In addition, AKI-Cr can occur in the absence of oliguria. Moreover, this relation may be frequently distorted by the administration of large amounts of intravenous fluids, diuretics, vasopressor drugs, or any combination of these. Conversely, oliguria can reflect salt and water retention as a normal renal response to a mild or moderate degree of hypovolemia or hypotension. Pain, trauma, and surgery can trigger similar neuro-endocrine responses resulting in oliguria in the absence of hemodynamic compromise and in the presence of normal renal function.

### Redefining urine output thresholds for acute kidney injury criteria in critically ill patients: a derivation and validation study [^a18bc674]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The current definition and staging of acute kidney injury (AKI) considers alterations in the serum creatinine (sCr) level and urinary output (UO). The definition of reduced UO can be complex and ideally must encompass (1) physiological concepts where the urine volume should be sufficient to eliminate all necessary solutes at maximum urinary concentration; (2) structural injuries detectable by new renal biomarkers; (3) proposed therapies and (4) significant short- and long-term patient outcomes. Although studies have demonstrated the importance of reduced UO, defined by AKI criteria, on severity assessment and patient outcomes even when not accompanied by serum creatinine criteria, the threshold of 0.5 ml/kg/h has recently been challenged, and studies in critically ill patients have reported an association with mortality only when lower thresholds are present.

In a larger cohort study conducted in Finland, compared to standard thresholds, stricter (< 0.3 ml/kg/h for 6 h or < 0.1 ml/kg/h for 3 h) cutoffs increased the predictive value of reduced UO for mortality. More recently, based on findings from another large cohort of critically ill patients, a minimum average UO of < 0.2 ml/kg/h for 6 h was suggested as the new threshold to define oliguria. These and other studies raised other caveats on the AKI definition: the duration of reduced urine output (from 3 to 24 h intervals) and, if averaged (total UO in a time window divided by the number of hours) or a persistent (UO below the threshold every hour of the time window) reduction in UO during the time frame must be used.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for acute kidney injury [^0380416f]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Medium credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) definition — urine output criteria: Both RIFLE and AKIN included duration of oliguria in their definitions and staging criteria, but studies found poor calibration between urine output criteria and serum creatinine criteria and poor prognostic correlation between briefer durations of oliguria and small changes in serum creatinine level. Oliguria may reflect under-resuscitation rather than kidney injury, and the weight-based urine output definition limits use in obesity, such that under the current definition, urine output of 40 mL/h in a 90-kg patient for 12 hours would lead to classification as stage 2 AKI. Diuretic administration has been shown to change RIFLE classification by urine output criteria, and pharmacologic agents such as loop diuretics or dopamine may not be helpful and may even be harmful in some settings. While inclusion of urine output criteria may encourage documentation of urine output and overall fluid balance, there are risks of unintended consequences with defining transient oliguria as AKI, and the authors state that current data are inadequate to support reliance on oliguria as a surrogate end point in clinical trials or in performance metrics. In pediatrics, reliance on urine output and weight-based fluid balance makes inclusion reasonable; nonetheless, further research is needed and practitioners should recognize that many of the same limitations to the use of urine output criteria apply in the pediatric population.

Towards an improved AKI diagnosis?

Although the kidney has many functions, AKI is mostly defined as a decrease of glomerular filtration rate (GFR). The KDIGO workgroup proposed a consensus definition and staging system for clinical practice (the KDIGO definition) that relies on the increase of serum creatinine (Scr) within 7 days and/or the presence of oliguria (Fig. 1), both surrogate markers of GFR. This definition has enabled to streamline research in the field. However, both Scr and urine output may also be influenced by non-renal and non-GFR-related factors and are, therefore, imperfect markers of reduced GFR. Consequently, the diagnosis of AKI by KDIGO criteria should be interpreted in the clinical context. Controversy on how to determine baseline kidney function is another drawback of the consensus definition. Despite the concerns about oliguria as a marker of kidney function, there is evidence that oliguria identifies patients with worse outcomes. In addition, because of the long half-life of creatinine and the presence of renal functional reserve (renal reserve capacity that can be recruited before basal GFR starts to decline), Scr requires time to accurately reflect GFR resulting in delayed recognition of kidney dysfunction. Potential solutions for a more timely detection of a reduced GFR could be measurement of creatinine clearance over 2 or 4 h, kinetic eGFR calculated from two serial creatinine measurements, or utilizing the plasma disappearance of an injected compound like iohexol that is dependent on renal clearance. These methods have not been extensively investigated or used in the ICU setting. Bedside real-time GFR measurements using injection of a dye and fluorescent probes and enabling earlier diagnosis of kidney dysfunction are under investigation, but do not yet have regulatory approval. Cystatin-C, another marker of glomerular filtration, might be useful in settings of muscle wasting, but is also affected by comorbidity.

### Oliguria as predictive biomarker of acute kidney injury in critically ill patients [^b719abe3]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

During critical illness, oliguria is often used as a biomarker of acute kidney injury (AKI). However, its relationship with the subsequent development of AKI has not been prospectively evaluated.

Methods

We documented urine output and daily serum creatinine concentration in patients admitted for more than 24 hours in seven intensive care units (ICUs) from six countries over a period of two to four weeks. Oliguria was defined by a urine output < 0.5 ml/kg/hr. Data were collected until the occurrence of creatinine-defined AKI (AKI-Cr), designated by RIFLE-Injury class or greater using creatinine criteria (RIFLE-I[Cr]), or until ICU discharge. Episodes of oliguria were classified by longest duration of consecutive oliguria during each day were correlated with new AKI-Cr the next day, examining cut-offs for oliguria of greater than 1,2,3,4,5,6, or 12 hr duration,

Results

We studied 239 patients during 723 days. Overall, 32 patients had AKI on ICU admission, while in 23, AKI-Cr developed in ICU. Oliguria of greater than one hour was significantly associated with AKI-Cr the next day. On receiver-operator characteristic area under the curve (ROCAUC) analysis, oliguria showed fair predictive ability for AKI-Cr (ROCAUC = 0.75; CI:0.64–0.85). The presence of 4 hrs or more oliguria provided the best discrimination (sensitivity 52% (0.31–0.73%), specificity 86% (0.84–0.89%), positive likelihood ratio 3.8 (2.2–5.6), P < 0.0001) with negative predictive value of 98% (0.97–0.99). Oliguria preceding AKI-Cr was more likely to be associated with lower blood pressure, higher heart rate and use of vasopressors or inotropes and was more likely to prompt clinical intervention. However, only 30 of 487 individual episodes of oliguria preceded the new occurrence of AKI-Cr the next day.

Conclusions

Oliguria was significantly associated with the occurrence of new AKI-Cr, however oliguria occurred frequently compared to the small number of patients (~10%) developing AKI-Cr in the ICU, so that most episodes of oliguria were not followed by renal injury. Consequently, the occurrence of short periods (1–6 hr) of oliguria lacked utility in discriminating patients with incipient AKI-Cr (positive likelihood ratios of 2–4, with > 10 considered indicative of a useful screening test). However, oliguria accompanied by hemodynamic compromise or increasing vasopressor dose may represent a clinically useful trigger for other early biomarkers of renal injury.

### Association of oliguria with the development of acute kidney injury in the critically ill [^9e7149ed]. Kidney International (2016). Low credibility.

Urine output (UO) criterion may increase the sensitivity of the definition of acute kidney injury (AKI). We determined whether the empirically derived definition for oliguria(< 0.5 ml/kg/h) is independently associated with adverse outcome. Data analysis included hourly recorded UO from the prospective, multicenter FINNAKI study conducted in 16 Finnish intensive care units. Confounder-adjusted association of oliguria of different severity and duration primarily with the development of AKI defined by creatinine criterion (Cr-AKI) or renal replacement therapy(RRT) was assessed. Secondarily, we determined the association of oliguria with 90-day mortality. Of the 1966 patients analyzed for the development of AKI, 454 (23.1%) reached this endpoint. Within this AKI cohort, 312 (68.7%)developed Cr-AKI, 21 (4.6%) commenced RRT without Cr-AKI, and 121 (26.7%) commenced RRT with Cr-AKI. Episodes of severe oliguria (< 0.1 ml/kg/h) for more than 3 h were independently associated with the development of Cr-AKI or RRT. The shortest periods of consecutive oliguria independently associated with an increased risk for 90-day mortality were 6–12 h of oliguria from 0.3 to < 0.5 ml/kg/h, over 6 h of oliguria from 0.1 to < 0.3 ml/kg/h, and severe oliguria lasting over 3 h. Thus, our findings underlie the importance of hourly UO measurements.

### Identification of an optimal threshold to define oliguria in critically ill patients: an observational study [^07c2153a]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Our data are in agreement with other smaller observational studies conducted in other health systems such as New Zealand or Finland. Ralib et al. have determined optimal UO thresholds for prediction of mortality or the need for RRT for time windows of 1 to 12 h. These cut-offs were derived from AUC-ROC curves at a univariate level. For the 3- 6- and 12-h time windows, identified cut-offs were, respectively, 0.2, 0.3 and 0.5 ml/kg/h. Our analyses, based on a much larger dataset and modeling UO as a continuous predictor with smooth functional forms while accounting for age, comorbidities and severity score, lead to slightly different values particularly at 12 h. However, we confirm the authors' impression that current definition of oliguria is too liberal. In an analysis of the FINNAKI cohort, episodes of severe (< 0.1 ml/kg/h) oliguria lasting more than 3 consecutive hours were independently associated with the development of sCr-AKI or RRT. In this analysis, consistent with our data, oliguria defined as a UO between 0.3 and 0.5 ml/kg/h for 6 h, was not significantly associated with adjusted 90-day mortality (OR 1.65 [95% CI 1.0–2.72]). The shortest periods of consecutive oliguria associated with an increased risk for 90-day mortality on multivariate analyses were 6 h (for 0.1 to 0.3 ml/kg/h) and 3 h (for < 0.1 ml/kg/h).

### KDIGO clinical practice guidelines for acute kidney injury [^8fd1c3dc]. Nephron: Clinical Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

Oliguria and anuria — Urine output is both a reasonably sensitive functional index for the kidney and a biomarker of tubular injury, but the relationship between urine output, GFR, and tubular injury is complex, and oliguria may be more profound when tubular function is intact. With volume depletion and hypotension, urine volume is minimized and urine concentration maximized (> 500 m Osmol/kg), whereas when the tubules are injured, maximal concentrating ability is impaired and urine volume may be normal (nonoliguric renal failure). In oliguria with azotemia, high urine osmolality with low urine sodium is strong evidence of intact tubular function, but this should not be interpreted as "benign" or prerenal azotemia, and classification as "benign azotemia" or "acute renal success" is not consistent with available evidence. Severe oliguria or anuria can also be caused by urinary tract obstruction or total arterial or venous occlusion, which will result in rapid and irreversible kidney damage and require prompt recognition and management.

### Incidence, timing and outcome of AKI in critically ill patients varies with the definition used and the addition of urine output criteria [^917de8f2]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

The considerations mentioned above are applicable to most studies concerning incidence of AKI in critically ill patients. Our presented literature review showed large heterogeneity in patients included, AKI definition used, reference or baseline serum creatinine used, timeframe in which AKI was assessed and whether urine output was used. This inclusion, definition and reference creatinine heterogeneity could explain the differences in AKI incidence in these studies and makes published studies difficult to compare. We intended to conduct a sensitive literature search. However, a sensitive search strategy is always a trade-off between a sufficiently large numbers of hits so that it can be considered sensitive and a sufficiently low numbers of hits so that it can be achievable. With different search criteria other studies might also have been included.

More than a third of patients who only fulfilled AKI criteria based on urine output were admitted after scheduled surgery (Table 2). The significance of oliguria only in the post-operative period is relatively unknown and it is questionable if the prognostic value of AKI diagnosis and classification on oliguria only is applicable to these patients, although patients only fulfilling urine output criteria have higher one year mortality than patients not meeting one of the AKI criteria. The addition of urine output criteria to serum creatinine criteria leads to higher AKI incidences with earlier recognition especially in patients with mild to moderate AKI. It may be possible that more frequent measurements of serum creatinine also reduce the time needed for AKI detection but that would increase costs. Earlier recognition of patients having AKI could provide possibilities for prevention of kidney function deterioration and potentially improve outcomes. Furthermore, especially long-term follow up data are needed to evaluate associations between AKI based on urine output criteria only and kidney function and survival.

### Acute kidney injury [^3aed8928]. Lancet (2025). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on acute kidney injury:

- **Definition**: AKI is a sudden decrease in kidney function resulting from structural or functional injury that is characterized by decreased GFR, increased serum creatinine, and oliguria.
- **Pathophysiology**: AKI has multiple possible causes, including renal hypoperfusion, intrinsic renal dysfunction (glomerulonephritis, vasculitis, tubular necrosis, interstitial nephritis), or obstruction to the emptying of the kidneys (post-renal AKI).
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of AKI in the US is estimated at 179–317 cases per 100,000 person-years.
- **Disease course**: Hypoperfusion of the kidneys with resultant ischemic injury represents the most important group of etiologies, mediating AKI through cellular injury caused by a mismatch between oxygen and nutrient delivery to the nephrons.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Approximately 40% of patients with AKI do not recover renal function by hospital discharge. In this group of patients, AKI is associated with 1-year age-adjusted mortality of approximately 60%, compared to approximately 10% in patients who recovered renal function within 7 days.

### Definition of hourly urine output influences reported incidence and staging of acute kidney injury [^914f6bc1]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a rapid deterioration of renal function over hours to days which is associated with adverse clinical outcomes including increased mortality, prolonged length of admission, chronic kidney disease and dialysis dependence. AKI is identified by using rise in serum creatinine (SCr) and/or reduction in urine output as surrogate markers of reduced glomerular filtration rate. Since 2012 AKI has been commonly defined and staged for severity using criteria from Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Clinical Practice Guideline for Acute Kidney Injury. The definition proposed by KDIGO includes oliguria, which is defined as urine volume < 0.5 ml/kg/h for 6 h.

Urine output (UO) can detect AKI earlier than SCr, which is recognised to be a late biomarker of AKI e.g. one study suggested that UO can detect AKI 11 h earlier than SCr. In addition it is inexpensive, requiring no laboratory input and can be measured easily by non-specialist staff. UO has been suggested as a sensitive marker of AKI; even very short periods of oliguria can predict subsequent development of AKI (by KDIGO criteria) and SCr rise. Oliguria is also an independent predictor of adverse clinical outcomes. A urine output of < 0.3 ml/kg/h for > 6 h predicts mortality and need for RRT in critically ill patients. The KDIGO cut off of < 0.5 ml/kg/h for > 6 h is liberal in comparison. The use of UO in addition to SCr can improve the ability of KDIGO criteria to predict prolonged hospital stay, RRT or death. A recent study by Howitt et al. demonstrated that patients who met both KDIGO SCr and UO criteria for AKI stage 2 had prolonged hospital stay and increased mid-term mortality versus those who met only the UO criteria. Patients with the same KDIGO stage therefore had different outcomes depending on whether AKI staging was based on SCr, UO or both.

### Association of oliguria with acute kidney injury diagnosis, severity assessment, and mortality among patients with critical illness [^a252413e]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

AKI Incidence, Severity, and Association With 90-Day Mortality

As shown in Table 1, according to the KDIGO definition (overall stage), 12 143 patients (77.7%) presented with at least 1 episode of AKI during their ICU stay. The maximum AKI severity was stage 1 in 3027 patients (19.4%), stage 2 in 6329 patients (40.5%), and stage 3 in 2787 patients (17.8%) (Table 2).

Table 2.
90-Day Mortality According to AKI Stage by Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes Criteria

Abbreviations: AKI, acute kidney injury; NA, not applicable; OR, odd ratio; sCr, serum creatinine; UO, urinary output.

Patients with AKI had a higher 90-day mortality than those without AKI (2571 of 12 089 [21.3%] vs 288 of 3462 [8.3%]; P < .001). Among patients with AKI, 90-day mortality increased with severity: it was 15.0% (452 of 3013) in patients with AKI stage 1, 17.0% (1074 of 6304) in those with AKI stage 2, and 37.7% (1045 of 2772) in those with AKI stage 3 (P < .001 for all) (Table 2).

### The clinical relevance of oliguria in the critically ill patient: analysis of a large observational database [^bd7df6cd]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Recovery of a urine output is not itself a predictive factor, and urine output is not helpful in guiding fluid resuscitation. Patients with permanent oliguria had a more positive fluid balance than those with transient or prolonged oliguria, which may explain in part the higher mortality rates in these patients, although it is not possible to determine whether these observations are epiphenomena or causal effects. Vaara et al. demonstrated an association between cumulative fluid overload (fluid accumulation > 10%) prior to RRT initiation and increased risk for 90-day mortality; the 90-day mortality rate of patients with fluid overload was 59.2% versus 31.4% without (difference of 27.8%, p < 0.001). In an earlier analysis of the ICON database, we reported that fluid balances became negative after the third ICU day in survivors but remained positive in non-survivors and that higher cumulative fluid balance at day 3 after ICU admission was independently associated with an increase in the hazard of death. However, large randomized controlled trials have not shown a significant impact of fluid resuscitation strategy on clinical outcome or need for RRT.

Our study has several strengths but also some limitations. Strengths include the large database with patients from around the world, providing external validity, and the collection of data during the ICU stay. Limitations include the complexity of elements associated with oliguria that cannot be separated out, for example, we were unable to assess the need for fluids or diuretics or to assess the impact of different vasopressors. Moreover, criteria for RRT were not pre-defined due to the study design. Thus, RRT may have been used for fluid overload, increased urea and creatinine concentrations, electrolyte abnormalities, severe acidosis, and any combination of these. Another limitation is the lack of pre-admission data regarding the length of oliguria prior to ICU admission or the underlying reason for oliguria as well as the lack of post-discharge data. The methods of monitoring urine output and assessing body weight also likely varied across centers and may have influenced the accuracy of measurements. Finally, we chose a definition of oliguria using a cut-off of urine output of 0.5 ml/kg/h, but this degree of urine output may in fact be adequate for some patients, e.g. the very obese and the very old.

### Oliguria as predictive biomarker of acute kidney injury in critically ill patients [^ceb8ac56]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Studies examining the application of sCr and urine output criteria in the AKIN and RIFLE definitions of AKI have shown that addition of the urine output criteria (oliguria ≥ 6 hours) to sCr criteria can improve the ability to predict mortality, but that urine output criteria alone show a lower predictive ability than sCr. Macedo et al. recently reported a prospectively single-center study of oliguria in 75 medical ICU patients, applying the AKIN criteria. In their study 24 (32%) patients had oliguria of six hours or more (< 0.5 ml/kg/hr) without developing AKIN-1 by sCr criteria while four patients (5%) developed sCr criteria without oliguria, and 17 patients (23%) had AKIN-1 AKI by both criteria. These results are broadly in agreement with the frequency of oliguria observed in our data and the notion that, while the majority of cases of AKI-Cr are associated with oliguria, significant periods (≥ 6 hours) of oliguria occur frequently without subsequent elevation of sCr even when using a much lower threshold for the diagnosis of AKI (AKIN-1). However, the above study did not assess the utility of oliguria as an earlier predictor of AKI-Cr and did not examine the ability of shorter periods of oliguria to predict AKI-Cr.

### The clinical relevance of oliguria in the critically ill patient: analysis of a large observational database [^3fa652e5]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

The mortality rate was higher in patients with oliguria than in those without. In an analysis of 21,207 ICU patients from the large MIMIC-II database, Zhang et al. similarly reported increased mortality in patients with oliguria on day 1. However, oliguria may be an epiphenomenon of or surrogate for disease severity and after adjusting for multiple factors in the multilevel analysis, oliguria on admission was not independently associated with increased mortality in our patients. Importantly, we also analyzed the persistence of oliguria during the ICU stay and noted that ICU mortality rates in patients with transient oliguria were significantly lower than those in non-oliguric patients. Indeed, ICU and hospital mortality rates were lower in these patients with transient oliguria than in the overall ICON cohort (ICU 16.2%, hospital 22.4%, both p < 0.001). Our results therefore highlight that the duration of oliguria seems to be more important than the presence of oliguria per se. Macedo et al. similarly reported that prolonged duration of oliguria (> 12 h) was associated with increased mortality. Vaara et al. reported that 6–12 h of oliguria (0.3 to < 0.5 ml/kg/h), > 6 h of oliguria (0.1 to < 0.3 ml/kg/h), and severe oliguria (< 0.1 ml/kg/h) lasting > 3 h were independently associated with increased 90-day mortality. In an earlier analysis of the ICON database, patients who remained in stage 3 AKI (defined using the AKIN urine output or creatinine criteria) for a 7-day period had higher mortality rates than those in whom renal function recovered. Prowle et al. noted that although oliguria of longer than 1 h was significantly associated with the subsequent development of AKI diagnosed using creatinine criteria, short periods (1–6 h) of oliguria were not accurate at predicting AKI. In a cohort of patients undergoing major abdominal surgery, the presence of oliguria (urine output < 0.3 ml/kg/h) during surgery was indicative of an elevated probability of later AKI. Similar results were recently published by Myles et al. when a urine output < 0.5 ml/kg/h was used to define oliguria.

### Targeting urine output and 30-day mortality in goal-directed therapy: a systematic review with meta-analysis and meta-regression [^8ccccb3f]. BMC Anesthesiology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Oliguria is associated with a decreased kidney- and organ perfusion, leading to organ damage and increased mortality. While the effects of correcting oliguria on renal outcome have been investigated frequently, whether urine output is a modifiable risk factor for mortality or simply an epiphenomenon remains unclear. We investigated whether targeting urine output, defined as achieving and maintaining urine output above a predefined threshold, in hemodynamic management protocols affects 30-day mortality in perioperative and critical care.

Methods

We performed a systematic review with a random-effects meta-analyses and meta-regression based on search strategy through MEDLINE, EMBASE and references in relevant articles. We included studies comparing conventional fluid management with goal-directed therapy and reporting whether urine output was used as target or not, and reporting 30-day mortality data in perioperative and critical care.

Results

We found 36 studies in which goal-directed therapy reduced 30-day mortality (OR 0.825; 95% CI 0.684–0.995; P = 0.045). Targeting urine output within goal-directed therapy increased 30-day mortality (OR 2.66; 95% CI 1.06–6.67; P = 0.037), but not in conventional fluid management (OR 1.77; 95% CI 0.59–5.34; P = 0.305). After adjusting for operative setting, hemodynamic monitoring device, underlying etiology, use of vasoactive medication and year of publication, we found insufficient evidence to associate targeting urine output with a change in 30-day mortality (goal-directed therapy: OR 1.17; 95% CI 0.54–2.56; P = 0.685; conventional fluid management: OR 0.74; 95% CI 0.39–1.38; P = 0.334).

Conclusions

The principal finding of this meta-analysis is that after adjusting for confounders, there is insufficient evidence to associate targeting urine output with an effect on 30-day mortality. The paucity of direct data illustrates the need for further research on whether permissive oliguria should be a key component of fluid management protocols.

### Defining urine output criterion for acute kidney injury in critically ill patients [^54a88be3]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The widespread use of RIFLE and AKIN classification systems for acute kidney injury (AKI) diagnosis and staging has established the association between AKI severity and adverse outcomes. However, as a result of the difficulties in measuring and recording the urine output every hour, a few prospective studies have validated the urine output criterion as stated in these classification systems. We assessed hourly urine output in ICU patients using an automated and accurate device to determine if changes in urine flow and volume could be a sensitive marker of AKI. Additionally, we assessed various definitions of oliguria to determine whether measurement of urine output using a fixed 6-h interval that matches nurses' shifts would be equivalent to the current standard for AKI diagnosis and staging.

Methods

Hourly urine output was recorded continuously using a digital monitor in a medical ICU. Serum creatinine measurements were done at least once per 24 h. We assessed changes in urine output by four different definitions of oliguria. Patients with no AKI by either criterion were compared with patients diagnosed exclusively by the urine output criterion, exclusively by serum creatinine criterion and by both criteria.

Results

Fifty-five percent of patients had an episode of oliguria during the ICU stay. There was no significant difference assessing urine output every hour or the total urine volume in a 6-h period for the detection of episodes of oliguria. Twenty-one patients (28%) were diagnosed as AKI using the serum creatinine criterion, whereas additional 24 (32%) were identified by the urine output criterion.

Conclusions

Episodes of oliguria occur frequently in ICU patients and identify a higher percentage of AKI patients compared to serum creatinine criterion. Alterations in urine flow may be a sensitive marker of renal dysfunction and need to be validated in larger cohorts.

### The urine output definition of acute kidney injury is too liberal [^c6950e3d]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

At a threshold of 0.5 ml/kg/hour there was a higher incidence of AKI utilising the urine output definition compared with the plasma creatinine-based definition (61% vs. 38%). Thirty-four per cent of patients with AKI based on urine output were not diagnosed AKI by the plasma creatinine changes. Previous studies have also reported a higher incidence of AKI by urine output compared with the creatinine criteria. Eleven per cent (n = 80) of our patients had AKI based on creatinine, but not urine output, and they may be described as nonoliguric AKI. These patients may also be those with recovering AKI in that creatinine had yet to fall to baseline although GFR had already recovered.

A urine output below an average of 0.3 ml/kg/hour over 6 hours was associated with higher mortality and dialysis need than 0.5 mg/kg/hour over 6 hours. Both the ROC optimal threshold for prediction of mortality or dialysis and the threshold that had the same sensitivity as AKI Cr for predicting mortality or dialysis were, serendipitously, 0.3 ml/kg/hour over 6 hours. Interestingly, acute oliguria is classically defined as urine output < 400 ml/day, which is equal to 0.24 ml/kg/hour in a 70 kg human. This is the minimum urine required to eliminate 300 mOsm/day in a maximum urine concentration of 1,200 mOsm/kg. Defining AKI as daily urine output < 500 mL or creatinine > 3.5 mg/dl, Teixerira and colleagues showed that the mean 24-hour urine volume was lower in those who died compared with survivors.

### Comparison of methods to normalize urine output in critically ill patients: a multicenter cohort study [^306c4d20]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

According to the kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) consensus, oliguria is defined as a urine output (UO) of less than 0.5 ml/kg/h for 6 h or more. Based on this definition, oliguria is observed in up to 75% of critically ill patients and associated with 90-day mortality, irrespective of changes in serum creatinine (sCr). However, the rational and the method to apply to normalize UO to body weight (BW) are unclear. Indeed, in critically ill patients, pre-admission BW might be difficult to retrieve, particularly in uncounscious patients, and its estimation by nurses has been shown to be highly inaccurate. In addition, the actual body weight (ABW) is subject to massive variations, mostly related to fluid overload and, to a lesser degree, muscle mass loss. Finally, several types of BW can be considered: pre-admission, actual, ideal or adjusted BW. These might significantly differ, particularly in obese or underweight patients. The lack of standardization of the considered BW to normalize UO might greatly influence the observed incidence of oliguria and thus AKI, and its association with outcomes.

To the best of our knowledge, only a handful of studies have addressed this issue. In a series of 493 patients, normalization of UO by the actual BW (ABW) led to a higher observed incidence of oliguria than normalization by the ideal BW (IBW). Oliguria was significantly associated with mortality only when normalized by IBW. These results were confirmed in two larger studies, conducted in the United States and Germany. In a fourth study, conducted in 569 patients with sepsis, the association between oliguria and mortality was not influenced by the method used to normalize UO. However, none of these studies explored the relationship between weight, height and UO during the ICU stay nor have they compared several candidates for UO normalization in a large population of critically ill patients. In addition, they were all single center studies and lacked validation in a cohort with different weight distributions. Hence, to date, no definitive conclusions can be made on how to normalize UO for oliguria and AKI diagnosis.

Accordingly, we sought to leverage two large datasets from two different countries and health care systems to explore the impact of the method applied to normalize UO on the observed incidence of oliguria and its association with outcomes.

AKI Diagnosis and Staging According to UO

According to the KDIGO criteria, AKI was defined, on an hourly basis, as a 6-hour mean of less than 0.5 mL/kg/h. An AKI of stage 1 was defined as a 6-hour mean of less than 0.5 mL/kg/h, stage 2, as a 12-hour mean of less than 0.5 mL/kg/h; and stage 3, as a 24-hour mean of less than 0.3 mL/kg/h or a 12-hour mean equal to 0 mL/kg/h (anuria). As implied by such definitions, AKI stage 2 or 3 could not have been diagnosed using UO criteria before 12 hours of ICU stay.

Overall AKI Diagnosis and Group Allocation

An AKI stage was attributed to each patient for every single hour of the ICU stay based on (1) sCr criteria, (2) UO criteria, and (3) the highest among sCr and UO criteria (overall stage). For diagnosis and classification, we considered the highest AKI stage reached by a patient using sCr criteria (sCr stage), UO criteria (UO stage), and overall (overall stage) at any time within the ICU stay. Finally, patients were classified into 1 of the following categories: no AKI if they never fulfilled any AKI criteria; sCr plus UO if they fulfilled both criteria; UO only if they fulfilled UO but not sCr criteria; or sCr only if they fulfilled sCr but not UO criteria.

Missing Values Management

For missing sCr values, we attributed values calculated by linear approximation between the previous and the next measures available. When only 1 value was available, a similar value was attributed to the previous day or the next day. For missing UO values, we attributed values calculated by dividing the next available value by the number of adjacent missing values (eg, the sequence missing, missing, missing, 200 was replaced with 50, 50, 50, 50), assuming the sequence corresponded to consolidated data entry.

Missing values at the end of the ICU stay were not considered. An hourly UO value greater than 1000 mL that remained after processing of missing values was considered erroneous and replaced by the closest hourly UO value available. The number of missing and attributed values are reported below.

### Empirical relationships among oliguria, creatinine, mortality, and renal replacement therapy in the critically ill [^329e3a62]. Intensive Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

The observation periods and thresholds of serum creatinine and urine output defined in the Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) criteria were not empirically derived. By continuously varying creatinine/urine output thresholds as well as the observation period, we sought to investigate the empirical relationships among creatinine, oliguria, in-hospital mortality, and receipt of renal replacement therapy (RRT).

Methods

Using a high-resolution database (Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care II), we extracted data from 17,227 critically ill patients with an in-hospital mortality rate of 10.9%. The 14,526 patients had urine output measurements. Various combinations of creatinine/urine output thresholds and observation periods were investigated by building multivariate logistic regression models for in-hospital mortality and RRT predictions. For creatinine, both absolute and percentage increases were analyzed. To visualize the dependence of adjusted mortality and RRT rate on creatinine, the urine output, and the observation period, we generated contour plots.

Results

Mortality risk was high when absolute creatinine increase was high regardless of the observation period, when percentage creatinine increase was high and the observation period was long, and when oliguria was sustained for a long period of time. Similar contour patterns emerged for RRT. The variability in predictive accuracy was small across different combinations of thresholds and observation periods.

Conclusions

The contour plots presented in this article complement the AKIN definition. A multi-center study should confirm the universal validity of the results presented in this article.

### The clinical relevance of oliguria in the critically ill patient: analysis of a large observational database [^33e290ce]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Urine output is widely used as one of the criteria for the diagnosis and staging of acute renal failure, but few studies have specifically assessed the role of oliguria as a marker of acute renal failure or outcomes in general intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Using a large multinational database, we therefore evaluated the occurrence of oliguria (defined as a urine output < 0.5ml/kg/h) in acutely ill patients and its association with the need for renal replacement therapy (RRT) and outcome.

Methods

International observational study. All adult (> 16years) patients in the ICON audit who had a urine output measurement on the day of admission were included. To investigate the association between oliguria and mortality, we used a multilevel analysis.

Results

Of the 8292 patients included, 2050 (24.7%) were oliguric during the first 24 h of admission. Patients with oliguria on admission who had at least one additional 24-h urine output recorded during their ICU stay (n = 1349) were divided into three groups: transient-oliguria resolved within 48h after the admission day (n = 390 [28.9%]), prolonged-oliguria resolved > 48h after the admission day (n = 141 [10.5%]), and permanent-oliguria persisting for the whole ICU stay or again present at the end of the ICU stay (n = 818 [60.6%]). ICU and hospital mortality rates were higher in patients with oliguria than in those without, except for patients with transient oliguria who had significantly lower mortality rates than non-oliguric patients. In multilevel analysis, the need for RRT was associated with a significantly higher risk of death (OR = 1.51 [95% CI 1.19–1.91], p = 0.001), but the presence of oliguria on admission was not (OR = 1.14 [95% CI 0.97–1.34], p = 0.103).

Conclusions

Oliguria is common in ICU patients and may have a relatively benign nature if only transient. The duration of oliguria and need for RRT are associated with worse outcome.

### Oliguria as predictive biomarker of acute kidney injury in critically ill patients [^975fba90]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Our data indicate that, if, for example, oliguria of two hours or more was used to trigger further fluid resuscitation, some patients might receive unnecessary fluid therapy, whereas others who might benefit from such intervention might not receive it. Thus, while clinically helpful, oliguria should be interpreted with caution in isolation, but may be more usefully interpreted in the clinical context as a screening test to direct additional methods for early detection of renal injury.

Another important observation from our study is that more patients had biochemically overt AKI on ICU admission than developed it in the ICU. This finding suggests the renal component of critical illness develops outside the ICU in most patients and that oliguria might be a more useful screening test in the pre-ICU environment. However, patients outside the ICU rarely have hourly documentation of urine output. Surgical patients may be more likely to have monitoring of urine output and develop AKI-Cr in the ICU. However, oliguria appeared, if anything, less predictive of AKI-Cr in this group - perhaps because transient postoperative oliguria is a common and relatively benign response to surgery.

### Targeting urine output and 30-day mortality in goal-directed therapy: a systematic review with meta-analysis and meta-regression [^7b001a9b]. BMC Anesthesiology (2017). Low credibility.

Definitions

Goal-directed therapy was defined as any hemodynamic optimization strategy in the perioperative and critical care setting, utilizing parameters related to cardiac output and oxygen delivery, either exclusively or in combination with classical parameters such as blood pressure and heart rate, irrespective of the device or method used to measure these parameters. Urine output as a target was defined as achieving and maintaining urine output using fluids and vasoactive medication above a predefined threshold. We did not redefine the urine output thresholds and used the thresholds as set by the respective studies. No distinction was made between isolated oliguria or urine output in combination with other hemodynamic parameters. We defined mortality as death by all causes within 30 days after inclusion. In case mortality was reported as 'intensive care mortality' or 'in-hospital mortality', we used the respective length of stay data to determine the survival duration. Studies in which more than 75% of the patients were admitted for less than 30 days were considered for reporting 30-day mortality.

Data collection

Two authors (E.Z. M.E.) extracted the following variables: total study population, size of GDT arm, size of CFM arm, type of patients, timing of the intervention period, definition of GDT and CFM, urine output target criteria, total amount of fluids infused per study arm, intraoperative and postoperative urine output data, treatment targets in both study arms, definition of mortality and number of deaths.

### Oliguria and acute kidney injury in critically ill children: implications for diagnosis and outcomes [^e43c7c80]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Consensus definitions for acute kidney injury are based on changes in serum creatinine and urine output. Although the creatinine criteria have been widely applied, the contribution of the urine output criteria remains poorly understood. We evaluated these criteria individually and collectively to determine their impact on the diagnosis and outcome of severe acute kidney injury.

Design and Setting

Post hoc analysis of Assessment of Worldwide Acute Kidney Injury, Renal Angina, and Epidemiology study-a prospective international observational multicenter study.

Patients

Critically ill children enrolled in Assessment of Worldwide Acute Kidney Injury, Renal Angina and, Epidemiology database.

Measurement

To assess the differential impact of creatinine and urine output criteria on severe acute kidney injury (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes stage ≥ 2). Patients were divided into four cohorts: no-severe acute kidney injury, severe acute kidney injury by creatinine criteria only, severe acute kidney injury by urine output criteria only, and severe acute kidney injury by both creatinine and urine output criteria.

Results

Severe acute kidney injury occurred in 496 of 3,318 children (14.9%); 343 (69.2%) were creatinine criteria only, 90 (18.1%) were urine output criteria only, and 63 (12.7%) were both creatinine and urine output criteria. Twenty-eight-day mortality for creatinine criteria only and urine output criteria only patients was similar (6.7% vs 7.8%) and higher than those without severe acute kidney injury (2.9%; p < 0.01). Both creatinine and urine output criteria patients had higher mortality than creatinine criteria only and urine output criteria only patients (38.1%; p < 0.001). Compared with patients without severe acute kidney injury, the relative risk of receiving dialysis increased from 9.1 (95% CI, 3.9–21.2) in creatinine criteria only, to 28.2 (95% CI, 11.8–67.7) in urine output criteria only, to 165.7 (95% CI, 86.3–318.2) in both creatinine and urine output criteria (p < 0.01).

Conclusions

Nearly one in five critically ill children with acute kidney injury do not experience increase in serum creatinine. These acute kidney injury events, which are only identified by urine output criteria, are associated with comparably poor outcomes as those diagnosed by changes in creatinine. Children meeting both criteria had worse outcomes than those meeting only one. We suggest oliguria represents a risk factor for poorer outcomes among children who develop acute kidney injury. Application of both the creatinine and urine output criteria leads to a more comprehensive epidemiologic assessment of acute kidney injury and identifies a subset of children with acute kidney injury who are at higher risk for morbidity and mortality.

### Oliguria, volume overload, and loop diuretics [^a07f0344]. Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is commonly and increasingly encountered in patients with critical illness. In the past, epidemiologic studies have consistently found that oliguria further increases the risk of death from AKI. Compared with patients outside the intensive care unit (ICU), critically ill patients are more likely to have volume overload as a result of impaired solute and water excretion. Recently, broad changes have occurred in ICU practice, such as early goal-directed therapy in sepsis, which may further compound volume overload in the ICU patient with oliguric AKI. Evidence has also emerged to suggest that a positive fluid accumulation in ICU patients can unfavorably affect outcome. Thus, the ICU patient with oliguric AKI presents a dilemma with limited therapeutic options. These would include optimization of systemic hemodynamics, added fluid therapy, administration of loop diuretics, or finally, the initiation of renal replacement therapy. Interestingly, recent survey data and observational studies indicate that a majority of intensivists use loop diuretics, specifically furosemide, at some point during the course of illness in patients with AKI. Paradoxically, loop diuretics have been found in several clinical studies of patients with AKI to be potentially detrimental or, at the least, lack effectiveness for improving clinical outcomes. This contradiction between clinical practice and available evidence would suggest there is equipoise and need for higher-quality evidence to better characterize the role of loop diuretics in ICU patients with AKI.

### Association of oliguria with acute kidney injury diagnosis, severity assessment, and mortality among patients with critical illness [^4c033b3e]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Nonetheless, our study has limitations that are worth discussing. First, as a monocentric study, its external validity might be questioned. However, patients' characteristics, the incidence of AKI, and the UO contribution in our study are largely consistent with data from previous publications in other health care environments. Second, as a retrospective study, our conclusions are inherently limited to the description of potential associations between oliguria and adverse outcomes but cannot validate causal relations. However, given the granularity of our database and the number of patients, we were able to include numerous parameters in our multivariate analyses and account for most of the major known cofounders. Third, almost half our patients did not have a true baseline sCr value, a major determinant of KDIGO stage. For these patients, we considered the lowest value obtained during the index hospital admission (outside periods of KRT). This can be challenged because sCr values are known to undergo slow decreases during prolonged ICU stays (due to a loss of lean body mass). However, attributed values differed marginally from measured values (Table 1). More importantly, sensitivity analyses strongly suggest that such imputations had no impact on overall results (eFigure 5 in the Supplement). Fourth, our decision to choose the lowest sCr measurement in the prior 12 months as the reference baseline sCr level can be challenged because this may lead to bidirectional misclassification of AKI and affect its incidence and mortality. However, alternative definitions commonly found in the literaturewere assessed through sensitivity analyses and did not appear to influence our conclusions (eFigure 4 in the Supplement).

### Incorporating oliguria into the diagnostic criteria for acute kidney injury after on-pump cardiac surgery: impact on incidence and outcomes [^3ce3ee9d]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

Consensus definitions represent an important step toward defining the epidemiology of acute kidney injury (AKI). However, the oliguric component of these definitions remains of uncertain impact and utility after cardiac surgery. The authors sought to define the specific impact of oliguric criteria, both alone and in combination with serum creatinine criteria, on the observed incidence of AKI and associated adverse outcomes following adult cardiac surgery.

Design

Retrospective observational study over a 1-year period.

Setting

Academic medical institution.

Participants

A total of 311 adult patients undergoing elective valve and/or coronary artery bypass graft surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass.

Interventions

No interventions were performed as part of the study.

Measurements and Main Results

Hourly urine output and daily serum creatinine were recorded in the 2 days following surgery. AKI was defined by Acute Kidney Injury Network oliguric and serum creatinine criteria. Defined by serum creatinine criteria alone, the incidence of AKI was 17.7% and was associated strongly with in-hospital mortality (odds ratio 6.6, 95% confidence interval 1.4–30.5, p = 0.02) and renal replacement therapy (odds ratio 12.7, 95% confidence interval 2.4–67.3, p = 0.003) as well as time to discharge from the intensive care unit and hospital. Defined by oliguric criteria alone through 48 hours following surgery, the incidence of AKI dramatically increased to 55.6% but was not associated with mortality, renal replacement therapy, or time to discharge.

Conclusions

Acute Kidney Injury Network oliguric criteria applied over 48 hours after surgery dramatically increased the measured incidence of AKI after cardiac surgery, but was not associated with adverse outcomes.

### Association of oliguria with acute kidney injury diagnosis, severity assessment, and mortality among patients with critical illness [^1e3d81d5]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

Key Findings

We conducted a large cohort study including 15 620 patients admitted to a tertiary ICU. We found that 77.7% of all patients fulfilled KDIGO criteria for AKI at some stage during their ICU stay. There was poor agreement between sCr and UO criteria for AKI diagnosis. Urinary output criteria allowed us to identify AKI in patients who did not fulfill sCr criteria or to upgrade the AKI stage in 51.7% of the patients. Those reclassifications had an important prognostic implication because (1) patients exclusively discovered by UO criteria (no increase in sCr value) had a greater 90-day mortality than those without AKI, and (2) UO stage appeared to modulate the 90-day mortality within each sCr-based AKI stage. Finally, even after correction for sCr stage, comorbidities, and illness severity, UO stages 2 and 3 were strongly associated with 90-day mortality.

Comparisons With Previous Studies

Consideration of oliguria-based criteria greatly affects the number of patients classified as having AKI. Nevertheless, many studies, did not consider them or used simplified UO criteria without any concerns about the rigid time frames required for an adequate KDIGO classification. Although high-quality epidemiological studies have actually considered UO-based criteria, the association of UO criteria with diagnosis and outcomes has not been reported.,

To the best of our knowledge, only few large studies, have compared the relative diagnostic abilities of oliguria- and sCr-based criteria of the current KDIGO consensus. The first was a large (32 045 patients) retrospective study conducted in a single US center. The overall incidence of AKI (74.5%) was similar to that reported in the present study. Isolated oliguria was frequently observed and associated with poor 1-year outcomes. Stage 2 AKI only identified by UO also appeared to be the most prevalent group (5421 patients [16.9%]). Similarly, patients meeting both UO and sCr criteria had a lower survival compared with those who met a single criterion, particularly if the stage met was the same for both criteria. In this study, the importance of patient's reclassification by UO and its association with outcomes was not explored. Finally, the multivariable analyses only accounted for age and comorbidities.

### Renal replacement therapy in critically ill patients with acute kidney injury – when to start [^3bb364c5]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Despite the frequent use of renal replacement therapy (RRT) for patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) in the intensive care unit (ICU), there is no accepted consensus on the optimal indications and timing.

Methods

The aim of this paper is to identify optimal triggers for RRT in critically ill patients with AKI.

Results

We examined data from 2 randomized controlled trials, 2 prospective studies and 13 retrospective trials and found large variation in the different parameters and cut-offs for initiation of RRT. No single biochemical parameter was adequate to define the optimal indication and time to commence RRT. Degree of fluid overload, oliguria and associated non-renal organ failure appeared to be more appropriate parameters for initiation of RRT. We propose a clinical algorithm based on regular assessment of the patient's condition and trends in these parameters. It is intended to aid the process of deciding when to start RRT in critically ill adult patients with AKI.

Conclusion

Available evidence suggests that the decision when to start RRT in critically ill patients with AKI should be based on trends in the patient's severity of illness, presence of oliguria and fluid overload and associated non-renal organ failure rather than specific serum creatinine or urea values.

### Cumulative application of creatinine and urine output staging optimizes the kidney disease: improving global outcomes definition and identifies increased mortality risk in hospitalized patients with acute kidney injury [^d178bbfa]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Acute kidney injury is diagnosed according to creatinine and urine output criteria. Traditionally, both are applied, and a severity stage (1–3) is conferred based upon the more severe of the two; information from the other criteria is discarded. Physiologically, however, rising creatinine and oliguria represent two distinct types of renal dysfunction. We hypothesized that using the information from both criteria would more accurately characterize acute kidney injury severity and outcomes.

Design

Prospective cohort study.

Setting

Multicenter, international collaborative of ICUs.

Patients

Three thousand four hundred twenty-nine children and young adults admitted consecutively to ICUs as part of the Assessment of the Worldwide Acute Kidney Injury, Renal Angina and Epidemiology Study.

Measurements and Main Results

The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes creatinine and urine output acute kidney injury criteria were applied sequentially, and the two stages were summed, generating an Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) Score ranging from 1 to 6. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality; secondary outcomes were time until ICU discharge and nonrecovery from acute kidney injury. Models considered associations with AKI Score, assessing the relationship unadjusted and adjusted for covariates. Twenty-eight-day mortality and nonrecovery from acute kidney injury were modeled using logistic regression. For 28-day ICU discharge, competing risks analysis was performed. Although AKI Scores 1–3 had similar mortality to no Acute Kidney Injury, AKI Scores 4–6 were associated with increased mortality. Relative to No Acute Kidney Injury, AKI Scores 1–6 were less likely to be discharged from the ICU within 28 days. Relative to AKI Score 1, AKI Scores 2–6 were associated with higher risk of nonrecovery. Within the traditional Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes Stage 3 acute kidney injury cohort, when compared with AKI Score 3, AKI Scores 4–6 had increased mortality, AKI Scores 5–6 had prolonged time to ICU discharge, and AKI Score 6 experienced higher nonrecovery rates.

Conclusions

Cumulative application of the creatinine and urine output criteria characterizes renal excretory and fluid homeostatic dysfunction simultaneously. This Acute Kidney Injury score more comprehensively describes the outcome implications of severe acute kidney injury than traditional staging methods.

### Effect of implementing emergency nursing protocol about oliguria and anuria on patients' outcomes… [^59c49a9a]. ClinicalTrials (2023). Medium credibility.

Effect of Implementing Emergency Nursing Protocol About Oliguria and Anuria on Patients' OutcomesClinicalTrials. gov ID. Study Overview Obstructive anuria is defined as a total cessation of diuresis or a volume of less than 200 mL /24 hours or 0 mL/12 h. Oliguria is defined as a urine output that is less than 400 mL/24 h or less than 17 mL/h, due to unilateral or bilateral blockage of a single anatomical or functional kidney. It is rapidly the cause of acute renal failure, endangering the vital prognosis in the short term and requiring emergency treatment in a specialized environment, whatever its etiology. Obstructive anuria and oliguria constitutes a major cause for surgical acute kidney injury due to several diseases as cervical cancer, urinary stone, bladder cancer, urinary tract stenosis, and iatrogenic causes.

However, Obstructive anuria and oliguria management varies between each case; the treatment of choice is based on each patient's condition. We discovered that a proper management of obstructive anuria resulted in a low mortality rate as well as restoration of renal function in most patients. Anuria /Oliguria is frequently observed in the perioperative period and may be the consequence of hypovolemia and/or pain, both triggering the sympathetic nervous system, which in turn lead to activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system with ensuing oliguria. However, oliguria may also represent a warning of deteriorating renal function, especially in critically ill patients. 2 There are many complications from anuria and oliguria as cardiovascular complications include congestive heart failure, pulmonary edema, and hypertension, mainly as a result of salt and water retention.

Gastrointestinal complications as anorexia, nausea, vomiting and gastrointestinal bleeding. Neurologic complications as confusion and seizures may develop in the course of acute oliguria. There is a critical role of nurse for taking history for oliguria and anuria as total volumes of urine in 24 h, color of urine, accompanying symptoms as, special food or drugs as; history of relevant.

### Science and fiction in critical care: established concepts with or without evidence? [^23123f00]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Dogma #1: Give fluids, diuretics, and vasopressors if urinary output decreases

Most oliguric intensive care unit (ICU) patients receive fluids, diuretics, and/or vasopressors with the goal to prevent acute kidney injury (AKI). This treatment, however, is based on the belief that AKI in critically ill patients results from renal ischaemia. Whereas fluids and vasopressors are usually administered to increase renal blood flow and in proportion oxygen delivery, diuretics are given to reduce the osmolarity in the renal medulla. This is expected to increase glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and ultimately improve renal function.

Oliguria, however, is a clinical symptom rather than a disease. The underlying mechanisms include, but are not restricted to, hypovolaemia, physiologic stress response, tubular damage, post-renal obstruction or a combination of these factors. If hypovolaemia is not the cause of oliguria, it does not make sense to administer fluids for its treatment. Giving fluids to patients who are not hypovolaemic may in fact harm the kidneys by increasing intracapsular pressure, thereby further reducing urinary output. Hence, administering fluids to these patients may lead into a vicious cycle of infusing more and more fluids to treat oliguria, which is eventually a result of over-hydration. Furthermore, if functional renal damage is present, e.g. due to ischaemia or nephrotoxins, treating oliguria with fluids or diuretics is unlikely to improve renal function. In this context, it is also noteworthy that the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines for AKI recommend neither fluid therapy beyond the correction of hypovolaemia nor diuretics for the treatment of AKI. This is supported by the fact that clinical evidence for a sustained increase in urine output or improvement in renal blood flow secondary to fluids and/or diuretics is lacking. Conversely, indiscriminately giving fluids to oliguric patients increases the risk of fluid overload with negative consequences on morbidity. Although fluid overload has been identified as independent risk factor for AKI in critically ill patients, "fill and spill" ("fill" the circulation and urine will "spill") is still a dogma in many ICUs. Likewise, the concept of "squeeze and diurese" is commonly applied. It aims to increase mean arterial blood pressure with vasopressors ("squeeze") and at the same time administer loop diuretics to paralyse the medulla and avoid ischaemia ("diurese"). Interestingly, no randomised controlled trials (RCTs) support the latter treatment strategies.

### The urine output definition of acute kidney injury is too liberal [^643e4914]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

For clinical applicability and earlier detection of AKI, it may be feasible to assess urine output over < 6 hours. Reduction of urine output over 2 consecutive hours has been suggested. Prowle and colleagues investigated different durations of consecutive hours of oliguria from 1 to 12 hours in a multicenter study involving 239 patients. Urine output of 4 hours or more best discriminated between AKI Cr and No-AKI Cr. Recently Mandelbaum and colleagues retrospectively interrogated a database of over 25,000 ICU patients and observed an association between urine output thresholds and duration with mortality, and with renal replacement therapy. Urine outputs > 0.3 ml/kg/hour resulted in little or no increase in mortality until durations exceeded the 12 hours we assessed in this study. Even less sensitivity of urine output was found for renal replacement therapy. We found a linear relationship between the ROC optimal threshold and duration of urine output for discriminating between mortality or dialysis need and dialysis free-survival from to 0.14 ml/kg/hour for 1 hour to 0.47 ml/kg/hour for 12 hours. There was no difference in relative risk for this outcome as a function of duration from 3 to 9 hours. Although a shorter duration of urine output assessment may provide earlier diagnosis, this may be more susceptible to extraneous factors. A longer period of assessment > 9 hours is less sensitive and may miss acute changes.

### Acute kidney injury following cardiac surgery: current understanding and future directions [^ea4fe1e7]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Diagnosis

Establishing an accurate and timely diagnosis of AKI enables prompt treatment. Current consensus guidelines for AKI diagnosis use Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria. KDIGO criteria define AKI as a 0.3 mg/dl (≥ 26.5 mol/l) SCr increase from baseline within 48 hours of surgery, a 50% SCr increase from baseline within 7 days of surgery, or a decrease in urine output below 0.5 ml/kg/hour for 6 hours. All recent consensus criteria for AKI diagnosis, including RIFLE, AKIN, and KDIGO, use changes in SCr concentrations and urine output. Oliguria is common following cardiac surgery and typically occurs prior to SCr increase following renal injury, but often is an appropriate response to intravascular hypovolemia. For this reason and because accurate hourly urine output documentation is frequently poor, AKI is most often diagnosed by clinicians using SCr measurements. In a heterogeneous cohort of ICU patients, however, AKI using urine output criteria was common (60% of the cohort) and associated with similar poor outcomes (dialysis and mortality) to AKI by SCr criteria alone. AKI that met oliguria and creatinine threshold criteria in this study was associated with significantly worse outcomes than AKI from oliguria or creatinine alone. These results need replicating in cardiac surgery cohorts. Creatinine endpoints are better validated than oliguria endpoints but unfortunately require many hours or days to diagnose AKI after a renal insult and may be insensitive to mild kidney injury since the kidney can maintain glomerular filtration as nephrons are damaged. Conversely, small changes in SCr may reflect an ongoing systemic inflammatory process nonspecific to AKI. Nonetheless, the 0.3 mg/dl threshold is strongly associated with poor outcomes. What remains unclear is whether poor outcomes associated with stage 1 AKI result from the AKI or from an independent systemic process associated with the AKI.

### Practice patterns in the management of acute renal failure in the critically ill patient: an international survey [^b0ffe92e]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Several controversies have developed over acute renal failure (ARF) definition and treatment: which approach to patient care is most desirable and which form of renal replacement therapy (RRT) should be applied is an everyday matter of debate. There is also disagreement on clinical practice for RRT including the best timing to start, vascular access, anti-coagulation, membranes, equipment and finally, if continuous or intermittent techniques should be preferred. In this lack of harmony, the epidemiology of ARF has recently displayed an outbreak of cases in the intensive care units and nephrologists and intensivists are now called to work together in the case of such a syndrome.

Subjects and Methods

We report on the responses of 560 contributors, mostly coming from Europe, to a questionnaire submitted during the third International Course on Critical Care Nephrology held in Vicenza, Italy in June 2004. The questionnaire was divided into several sections concerning demographic and medical information, definition of ARF, practice of RRT, current opinions about clinical advantages and problems related to different RRTs and modalities, and beliefs on alternative indications to extracorporeal treatments.

Results

More then 200 different definitions of ARF and about 90 RRT start criteria were reported. Oliguria and RIFLE (an acronym classifying ARF in different levels of severity: Risk of renal dysfunction; Injury to the kidney; Failure of kidney function; Loss of kidney function; End-stage kidney disease.) were the most frequent criteria used to define ARF. In 10% of centres all forms of renal replacement techniques are available, and in 70% of cases two or more different techniques are available: absolute analysis of different techniques showed that continuous renal replacement therapies are utilized by 511 specialists (91%), intermittent haemodialysis by 387 (69%) and sustained low efficiency dialysis by 136 (24%). Treatment prescription showed significant differences among specialists, 60% of intensivists being uncertain on RRT dose prescription compared to 40% of nephrologists (P = 0.002). The most frequently selected dosage was '35 ml/kg/h' for urea (25%) and creatinine targets (26%), and '2–3 l/h' for the septic dose (25%). Of the participants, 90% said that they used RRT for non-renal indications, 60% although responders admitted the lack of scientific evidence as a limiting factor to its use.

Conclusions

New classifications such as RIFLE criteria might improve well-known uncertainty about ARF definition. Different RRT techniques are available in most centres, but a general lack of treatment dose standardization is noted by our survey. Non-renal indications to RRT still need to find a definitive role in routine practice.

### Urine output monitoring for the diagnosis of early-onset acute kidney injury in very preterm infants [^823ee23d]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

The current threshold used for oliguria in the definition of neonatal AKI has been empirically defined as 1 ml/kg per hour. Urine output criteria are generally poorly documented, resulting in uncertainty in the most accurate threshold to identify AKI in very preterm infants with known tubular immaturity.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

We conducted a bicentric study including 473 very preterm infants (24 0/7 6/7 weeks of gestation) born between January 2014 and December 2018 with urine output measurements every 3 hours during the first 7 days of life and two serum creatinine measurements during the first 10 days of life. AKI was defined using the neonatal Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) definition. We tested whether higher urine output thresholds (1.5 or 2 ml/kg per hour) in modified AKI definitions may better discriminate neonatal mortality compared with the current definition.

Results

Early-onset AKI was developed by 101 of 473 (21%) very preterm infants. AKI was diagnosed on the basis of urine output criteria alone (no rise in creatinine) for 27 of 101 (27%) participants. Early-onset AKI was associated with higher risk of death before discharge (adjusted odds ratio, 3.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.9 to 7.8), and the AKI neonatal KDIGO score showed good discriminative performance for neonatal mortality, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.68 (95% confidence interval, 0.61 to 0.75). Modified AKI definitions that included higher urine output thresholds showed significantly improved discriminative performance, with areas under the ROC curve of 0.73 (95% confidence interval, 0.66 to 0.80) for the 1.5-ml/kg per hour threshold and 0.75 (95% confidence interval, 0.68 to 0.81) for the 2-ml/kg per hour threshold.

Conclusions

Early-onset AKI was diagnosed on the basis of urine output exclusively for a quarter of the cases. Furthermore, modified AKI definitions that included higher urine output improved the discriminative performance for predicting mortality.

### Acute kidney injury 2016: diagnosis and diagnostic workup [^010cc0c0]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Similar problems may occur when defining AKI stage 3 by the RRT criterion. The optimal timing of RRT for AKI is not known and clinical practice is very variable. As such, AKI staging depends directly on the decision-making process of the clinician rather than underlying renal function.

Finally, single serum creatinine values do not provide any information about specific stages of the AKI process. Importantly, they do not indicate whether a patient is still in the progression phase or if recovery has already begun. Also, eGFR formulae are not valid to determine renal function in AKI.

Limitations of urine-based criteria for AKI

Urine output is an important clinical marker but, like creatinine, is not renal specific. In fact, urine output may persist until renal function almost ceases. Similarly, oliguria may be an appropriate physiological response of functioning kidneys during periods of prolonged fasting, hypovolaemia, after surgery, and following stress, pain, or trauma. In these situations, the action of anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) can result in the generation of very concentrated urine with osmolarities up to 1400 mmosm/l. Assuming a daily solute load of 700 mosmoles, the urine volume may physiologically decrease to 500 mL (i.e. 0.28 ml/kg/h in a 70 kg person) as a result of normal kidney function.

The KDIGO criteria for AKI are based on the presence of oliguria for a minimum of 6 h. Several experts have questioned the validity of this arbitrary cut-off and suggest using either a longer minimum period (e.g. 12 h) or a lower threshold for urinary output (e.g. 0.3 ml/kg/h instead of 0.5 ml/kg/h) to reach sufficient specificity for diagnosing AKI.

Finally, in obese patients, weight-based urine output criteria may be particularly misleading (Table 2). In fact, the European Renal Best Practice Guidelines (2012) recommend using the ideal weight rather than the true weight when calculating urine output in ml/min/kg to avoid an overdiagnosis of AKI.

Adjunctive diagnostic tools to diagnose AKI

In certain circumstances, it may be necessary to use additional tools to diagnose AKI, especially where creatinine and urine values change only slowly, are misleading, or cannot be interpreted accurately. This is particularly relevant for critically ill patients where the presence of fluid overload, muscle wasting, sepsis, and reduced effective circulating volume may completely mask the diagnosis of AKI.

### The clinical relevance of oliguria in the critically ill patient: analysis of a large observational database [^4481a80a]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The present study in a large cohort of ICU patients with urine outputs measured on admission and during the ICU stay reveals that oliguria is present in about one fourth of critically ill patients on admission to the ICU. The presence of oliguria on admission was not independently associated with an increased risk of death, but the persistence of oliguria during the ICU stay was associated with higher ICU and hospital mortality rates.

There are relatively few published data on the frequency of oliguria in general ICU patients. Oliguria is frequently observed in the perioperative period and may be the consequence of hypovolemia and/or pain, both triggering the sympathetic nervous system, which in turn lead to activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system with ensuing oliguria. However, oliguria may also represent a warning of deteriorating renal function, especially in critically ill patients. Macedo et al. reported that 47% of their cohort of 317 surgical ICU patients had an episode of oliguria (urine output < 0.5 ml/kg/h for at least 6 consecutive hours) during the ICU stay. In an analysis of data from the FINNAKI study, as many as 92% of patients had an episode of oliguria as defined by a urine output < 0.5 ml/kg/h for a minimum of 0.5 h. From their large database, Kellum et al. reported that 59% of ICU patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) met the KDIGO urine output criteria. In a smaller cohort, Md Ralib et al. reported that 61% of patients with AKI met urine output criteria (< 0.5 ml/kg/h), and in a study of critically ill cancer patients, 56% met urine output criteria for AKI.

### The clinical relevance of oliguria in the critically ill patient: analysis of a large observational database [^fb0b10e5]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

On the case report form, investigators recorded urine output in milliliters as a total for each 24-h period. On the day of admission, urine output data were recorded for the period from the time of admission till the start of the next ICU day. For the purposes of this study, oliguria was defined as a calculated urine output < 0.5 ml/kg/h averaged over a 24-h period. To calculate the urine output for the 24-h admission day period, if full urine output data for the first 24 h of admission were recorded, these data were used for the determination of oliguria "on admission". If data were provided for only X hours on the day of admission (because, for example, the patient was admitted at 10 pm and 24-h urine measurement started at midnight so only 2-h urine output were noted), the estimation of urine output on admission was averaged from the data for the X hours and the data from the first full day on the ICU (2nd day 24-h urine output/24 × [24 − X]). If no data were recorded for the admission day, we were unable to estimate an admission urine output and the patient was not included. The methods of measuring urine output or of assessing body weight were not recorded. Patients with comorbid chronic renal failure were excluded.

For analysis of evolution during the ICU stay, we included only patients who had a urine output recorded on the day of admission and at least one other 24-h urine output value, and separated them into three groups:
Transient oliguria — oliguria resolved within 48 h after the 24-h admission day
Prolonged oliguria — oliguria resolved more than 48 h after the 24-h admission day and not present at the end of the ICU stay
Permanent oliguria — oliguria present on the day of admission and persisting for the whole ICU stay or again present at the end of the ICU stay

### Defining oliguria during cardiopulmonary bypass and its relationship with cardiac surgery-associated acute kidney injury [^ee066634]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2016). Low credibility.

Background

While urine flow rate ≤ 0.5 mL kg⁻¹ h⁻¹ is believed to define oliguria during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), it is unclear whether this definition identifies risk for acute kidney injury (AKI). The purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate if urine flow rate during CPB is associated with AKI.

Methods

Urine flow rate was calculated in 503 patients during CPB. AKI in the first 48h after surgery was defined by the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes classification. Adjusted risk factors associated with AKI and urine flow rate were assessed.

Results

Patients with AKI [n = 149 (29.5%)] had lower urine flow rate than those without AKI (P < 0.001). The relationship between urine flow and AKI risk was non-linear, with an inflection point at 1.5 mL kg⁻¹ h⁻¹ Among patients with urine flow < 1.5 mL kg⁻¹ h⁻¹, every 0.5 mL kg⁻¹ h⁻¹ higher urine flow reduced the adjusted risk of AKI by 26% (95% CI 13–37; P < 0.001). Urine flow rate during CPB was independently associated with the risk for AKI. Age up to 80 years and preoperative diuretic use were inversely associated with urine flow rate; mean arterial pressure on CPB (when < 87mmHg) and CPB flow were positively associated with urine flow rate.

Conclusions

Urine flow rate during CPB < 1.5ml kg -1 h -1 identifies patients at risk for cardiac surgery-associated AKI. Careful monitoring of urine flow rate and optimizing mean arterial pressure and CPB flow might be a means to ensure renal perfusion during CPB.

### Early identification of acute kidney injury in the ICU with real-time urine output monitoring: a clinical investigation [^48eca0a7]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The RIFLE, AKIN, and KDIGO criteria for AKI have recognized the need to incorporate smaller time intervals for the assessment of kidney injury using UO. A recent study in ICU and cardiac surgery patients compared consecutive hourly measurements of UO to mean UO over the time measured. In the ICU patients it was shown that using a mean UO, rather than consecutively measured hours, led to misclassification of the KDIGO severity stage. For cardiac surgery patients the study found that averaging UO over time, versus consecutive hourly measurements, significantly overestimated the incidence of AKI.

Detection of oliguria is limited by the available tools, human error, and varying approaches to its definition. A reliable method for consecutive measurements of UO would provide a consistent application of the KDIGO UO criteria for diagnosis of AKI. In this study we demonstrated that consecutive electronically monitored UO identified significantly more cases of AKI according to the KDIGO criteria that were not identified by SCr alone. Additionally, in patients that fulfilled AKI definitions using both the SCr and UO criteria, UO elec measurement identified AKI significantly earlier than SCr.

The advantage of continuous measurements of UO was presented in a study showing oliguric periods as a predictor of higher mortality in critically ill patients. The authors discussed the need for a broader understanding of UO as a continuous physiological variable as opposed to one measured in set intervals.

It has also been argued that UO is too sensitive a biomarker for identifying AKI since oliguria may occur in response to normal physiological mechanisms. However, many studies confirm that oliguria, even in the absence of a rise in creatinine, identifies patients who have worse short-term and long-term outcomes, increased LOS, increased severity of AKI, and require more dialysis.

Our study was blinded, and UO for the patients was not documented in their records according to the electronic monitoring. The course of patient treatment was not based upon the consecutive electronic monitoring of UO, so the electronic monitoring did not impact ICU outcomes. This may explain why the patients with AKI as defined by UO elec had a similar LOS to that of the non-AKI population. However, the extended time in the hospital after ICU discharge for the patients with AKI as defined by UO elec (> 5 days in the general population and 8 days in the under-70 group Table 2) compared to the non-AKI patients, suggest there may be clinical implications for earlier identification of AKI using UO elec.

### Importance of intraoperative oliguria during major abdominal surgery: findings of the restrictive versus liberal fluid therapy in major abdominal surgery trial [^d9c00d82]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The association between intraoperative oliguria during major abdominal surgery and the subsequent development of postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) remains poorly defined. We hypothesised that, in such patients, intraoperative oliguria would be an independent predictor of subsequent AKI.

Methods

We performed a post hoc analysis of data from the Restrictive versus Liberal Fluid Therapy in Major Abdominal Surgery (RELIEF) trial of conservative vs liberal fluid therapy during and after major abdominal surgery. We used χ 2, logistic regression, and fractional polynomials to study the association between intraoperative oliguria defined as a urinary output < 0.5 mL kg⁻¹ h⁻¹ and the development of postoperative AKI defined by the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes consensus criteria.

Results

We included 2444 of 2983 patients from the RELIEF trial in this study. A total of 889 patients (36%) met oliguric criteria intraoperatively. Oliguria occurred in 35% of those without AKI, and 44%, 48%, and 45% of those who developed postoperative AKI Stages 1–3, respectively (P < 0.001 for trend). Intraoperative oliguria was associated with an increased risk of AKI, risk ratio: 1.38 (95% confidence interval: 1.14–1.44; P < 0.001), but greater intensity of oliguria (urine output < 0.3 mL kg⁻¹ h⁻¹) did not increase this risk further. Most patients with oliguria did not develop AKI; the positive predictive value of oliguria was 25.5%, and the negative predictive value was 81.6%.

Conclusions

Intraoperative oliguria, defined as urine output < 0.5 mL kg -1 h -1, was relatively common and was associated with postoperative AKI. However, the predictive utility of oliguria for AKI was low, whilst its absence had a good predictive value for an AKI-free postoperative course.

Epidemiology of postoperative AKI

A variety of criteria for changes in serum creatinine levels and urine output have been used to define AKI; however, the perioperative medicine community has largely adopted the 2012 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) consensus criteria to define PO-AKI in clinical trials and epidemiological studies. Adoption of this consensus definition has resulted in a greater appreciation of the incidence, varied presentation and outcomes of PO-AKI (Box 1). Although changes in serum creatinine are fairly common in the postoperative period, the incidence of PO-AKI varies according to the characteristics and urgency of surgery as well as the exact AKI definition employed, with a higher incidence in emergency surgery,– (Supplementary Table 1). The incidence of AKI in day or ambulatory surgery is unknown — but presumed to be low — owing to a lack of published data on the detection of AKI among patients who are discharged to the community immediately following surgery.

More is known about PO-AKI defined by change in serum creatinine than that defined by perioperative decrements in urine output. The prognostic implications of intraoperative transient oliguria are controversial, with some studies reporting a higher risk of subsequent adverse outcomes and others suggesting no increase in risk –. One study suggested that discrimination for subsequent adverse outcomes could be enhanced by testing for novel biomarkers. In this study, which included some patients with PO-AKI, the sum of the concentration of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 2 (TIMP2) multiplied by that of insulin-like growth factor binding protein 7 (IGFBP7) added prognostic information to AKI defined by urine output alone ([TIMP2]×[IGFBP7] > 2 was associated with progression from stage 1 AKI).

Many, but not all, of the available studies suggest that PO-AKI defined by oliguria alone is more common than PO-AKI defined by changes in serum creatinine levels. In a study of PO-AKI after non-cardiac surgery, the incidence of AKI increased from 8% to 64% if urine output was included in the definition. Some postoperative oliguria is assumed to be an appropriate physiological response to decreased intravascular volume, vasodilatation or non-osmotic release of arginine vasopressin in response to tissue injury; however, sustained decrements in urine output, even without accompanying changes in serum creatinine, have been associated with longer-term morbidity and mortality.

### Actual versus ideal body weight for acute kidney injury diagnosis and classification in critically ill patients [^fb65d8e2]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a frequent clinical syndrome among hospitalized, and particularly in critically ill, patients. The incidence of AKI occurring in patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) ranges from 30–60%. Independently associated with both short and long-term mortality, AKI-associated mortality was reported to be as high as 23%.

Previously, there have been many different definitions of AKI used in the literature and clinical practice. Various classifications, RIFLE (Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss of function, and End-stage renal disease [ESRD]) criteria in 2004, AKIN (Acute Kidney Injury Network) criteria in 2007, and most recently, KDIGO (Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes) criteria in 2012, have been developed and validated to standardize the diagnosis and staging the severity of AKI. The definition of AKI is currently based on absolute or relative changes in serum creatinine (SCr) and weight-adjusted hourly urine output (UO), respectively (Table 1). A general consensus of these definitions has reduced the variation in AKI research studies findings, as the vast majority of investigations within the past decade used these similar definitions to diagnose and stage AKI.

Table 1
KDIGO criterion for diagnosis and staging of AKI

Studies have found oliguria can be an early indicator of kidney dysfunction and is independently associated with poor mortality and morbidity. Body weight (BW) is an important factor and used when normalizing the UO for weight and time. The UO thresholds that are currently normalized to BW may need to be adjusted to an ideal body weight (IBW) to account for obesity or cachexia. However, It is not clearly specified whether actual body weight (ABW) or IBW, should be used to define AKI. Although a large number of recent studies reported UO criterion, the majority of them do not specify which body weight was used, leading to heterogeneity among different studies. In this report, we showed using different methods of measuring or calculating body weight can impact the sensitivity and specificity of the AKI definition.

This study aims to (1) evaluate and compare the incidence of AKI and its staging according to UO criteria, using ABW versus IBW and (2) investigate how using different BW calculations would affect predictive performance of AKI on 90-day mortality and other morbidities in critically ill patients.

### Advances in the diagnosis of early biomarkers for acute kidney injury: a literature review [^c8afe641]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Urine output monitoring

Urine output is one of the standard tools for diagnosing AKI. Oliguria (< 0.5 mL/kg/h) or anuria (< 50 mL/day) are early clinical signs of AKI. In 2012, the KDIGO guidelines proposed that a urine output of ≤ 0.5 mL/(kg·h) within 6 h can diagnose AKI. Although the reliability of oliguria as a renal function marker is debated, studies have shown it is closely associated with worse prognosis.

In AKI, changes in urine output alone may not accurately reflect the severity of kidney injury. Prerenal AKI typically presents with a significant reduction in urine output, whereas in renal AKI, particularly in cases of acute tubular necrosis (ATN), urine output may remain normal. Additionally, transient oliguria can be a physiological phenomenon and can be modulated with diuretics, but measurement errors can still occur even with a catheter. In patients with chronic underlying diseases, urine output tends to decrease more gradually, and recovery is more complex, further complicating the interpretation.

Imaging and electrolyte tests

Imaging and laboratory tests play a crucial role in identifying the cause of AKI and evaluating complications. Common imaging techniques include X-ray, ultrasound, CT, and MRI. X-ray can detect stones and calcification, while ultrasound is useful for evaluating kidney structure and urinary tract obstruction, especially in diagnosing postrenal AKI. CT provides detailed anatomical images, but contrast agents may exacerbate kidney damage, so caution is needed. MRI has no radiation and can be used in complex cases or when other imaging methods are inconclusive.

Laboratory tests focus on electrolyte and acid-base imbalances, such as hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, and hyperphosphatemia. Blood electrolyte testing can guide treatment, but it should be considered in conjunction with other clinical information for a comprehensive assessment.

### Acute kidney injury in patients with cirrhosis: Acute Disease Quality Initiative (ADQI) and international club of ascites (ICA) joint multidisciplinary consensus meeting [^4dd8bdb7]. Journal of Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Rationale:

AKI, AKD and CKD are classified by KDIGO according to duration and severity of structural and functional abnormalities (Fig. 1). The ICA currently defines and stages AKI by KDIGO SCr criteria only; however, oliguria is a sensitive and early marker of AKI that is associated with worse outcomes in critically ill patients with cirrhosis. Most cases of AKI will fulfil both SCr and UO criteria but clinical judgement should be utilised, taking into consideration that UO at baseline may be low in patients with cirrhosis and ascites. Measurement of UO, especially, outside the intensive care unit (ICU) is often inaccurate, and the frequent use of diuretics may affect inter-pretation; however, when possible, close monitoring of UO should be performed in order to detect moderate to severe AKI earlier, and reduce fluid overload. Recently, a combination of damage and functional biomarkers was proposed by ADQI to be used, along with clinical information, to define AKI and improve diagnostic and staging accuracy, but their role in patients with cirrhosis remains to be determined. CKD is defined as persistent glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 60 ml/min/1.73 m² and/or markers of kidney damage for > 3 months. Some individuals may have significant abnormalities of structure and/or function (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m² or increase in SCr by > 50%) within a duration of ≤ 3 months that do not fulfil the definitions of AKI or CKD; this period is described as AKD (Fig. 1). AKI is a subset of AKD, therefore, any patient with AKI, by definition, has AKD.

To date, a universal definition of post-AKI renal recovery is not available and remains controversial. Distinct phenotypes based on clinical course have been described in critical illness, defining full recovery as a return of SCr to within 0.3 mg/dl (26.5 μmol/L) of baseline, which also aligns with ADQIand ICA recommendations.– However, it is important to appreciate that use of the creatinine criteria may result in overestimation of recovery by ignoring the loss of muscle mass that occurs during critical illness.

What reference SCr value should be used to define AKI in patients with cirrhosis?

### Association between intraoperative oliguria and acute kidney injury after major noncardiac surgery [^a89e6fc5]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs in 6.1%-22.4% of patients undergoing major noncardiac surgery. Previous studies have shown no association between intraoperative urine output and postoperative acute renal failure. However, these studies used various definitions of acute renal failure. We therefore investigated the association between intraoperative oliguria and postoperative AKI defined by the serum creatinine criteria of the Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, and End-stage kidney disease (RIFLE) classification.

Methods

In this single-center, retrospective, observational study, we screened 26,984 patients undergoing elective or emergency surgery during the period September 1, 2008 to October 31, 2011 at a university hospital. Exclusion criteria were age < 18 years; duration of anesthesia < 120 minutes; hospital stay < 2 nights; local anesthesia only; urologic or cardiac surgery; coexisting end-stage kidney disease; and absence of serum creatinine measurement, intraoperative urine output data, or information regarding intraoperative drug use. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used as the primary analytic method.

Results

A total of 5894 patients were analyzed. The incidence of postoperative AKI was 7.3%. By multivariable analysis, ≥ 120 minutes of oliguria (odds ratio = 2.104, 95% CI, 1.593–2.778; P < .001) was independently associated with the development of postoperative AKI. After propensity-score matching of patients with ≥ 120 and < 120 minutes of oliguria on baseline characteristics, the incidence of AKI in patients with ≥ 120 minutes of oliguria (n = 827; 10%) was significantly greater than that in those with < 120 minutes of oliguria (n = 827; 4.8%; odds ratio = 2.195, 95% CI, 1.806–2.668; P < .001).

Conclusions

Contrary to previous studies, we found that intraoperative oliguria is associated with the incidence of AKI after major noncardiac surgery.

### Machine learning for the prediction of volume responsiveness in patients with oliguric acute kidney injury in critical care [^56e1741c]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

Source of data

A large US-based critical care database named Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) was analyzed. The MIMIC-III database is an integrated, de-identified, comprehensive clinical dataset containing all the patients admitted to the ICUs of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, MA, from June 1, 2001, to October 31, 2012. There were 53,423 distinct hospital admissions for adult patients (aged 16 years or above) admitted to the ICUs during the study period. Since the study was an analysis of a third-party anonymized publicly available database with pre-existing institutional review board (IRB) approval, IRB approval from our institution was exempted. The study was reported according to the recommendations of the Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) statement.

Participants

Patient eligibility was considered when urine output was less than 0.5 ml/kg/h for the first 6 h after ICU admission. This definition was consistent with the urine output component of the KDIGO criteria. To examine the impact of fluid resuscitation on subsequent urine output response, only patients with substantial fluid intake (> 5 l) within 6 h following the initial 6 h for assessing oliguria were eligible (Fig. 1). Fluid intake and urine output were extracted from the nursing chart system, which more accurately reflected the actual volume intake or output than the medical order system. Patients who left ICU during the observation period were excluded. Furthermore, patients receiving any diuretics and/or renal replacement therapy (RRT) on day 1 were excluded.

Fig. 1
Schematic illustration of the time windows for the definition of oliguria and fluid responsiveness. Oliguria was defined as urine output < 0.5 ml/kg/h for the first 6 h after ICU admission. Fluid responsiveness was defined as urine output > 0.65 ml/kg/h for 18 h after initiation of fluid loading. It is noted that the time window for the definition of oliguria preceded the exposure of fluid input

Outcome (volume responsiveness)

The urine output within an 18-h period following the initial 6 h for defining oliguria was used as the outcome. Patients were considered as VR-AKI if he/she had urine output greater than 0.65 ml/kg/h, corresponding to a 30% increase as compared with the baseline value. Otherwise, they were defined as VU-AKI.

### Assessment of prognostic value of intraoperative oliguria for postoperative acute kidney injury: a retrospective cohort study [^1a3c7e75]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Oliguria is often viewed as a sign of renal hypoperfusion and an indicator for volume expansion during surgery. However, the prognostic association and the predictive utility of intraoperative oliguria for postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) are unclear.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study on patients undergoing major thoracic surgery in an academic hospital to assess the association of intraoperative oliguria with postoperative AKI and its predictive value. To contextualise our findings, we included our results in a meta-analysis of observational studies on the importance of oliguria during noncardiac surgery.

Results

In our cohort study, 3862 patients were included; 205 (5.3%) developed AKI after surgery. Intraoperative urine output of 0.3 mL kg -1 h -1 was the optimal threshold for oliguria in multivariable analysis. Patients with oliguria had an increased risk of AKI (adjusted odds ratio: 2.60; 95% confidence interval: 1.24–5.05). However, intraoperative oliguria had a sensitivity of 5.9%, specificity of 98%, positive likelihood ratio of 2.74, and negative likelihood ratio of 0.96, suggesting poor predictive ability. Moreover, it did not improve upon the predictive performance of a multivariable model, based on discrimination and reclassification indices. Our findings were generally consistent with the results of a systematic review and meta-analysis, including six additional studies.

Conclusions

Intraoperative oliguria has moderate association with, but poor predictive ability for, postoperative AKI. It remains of clinical interest as a risk factor potentially modifiable to interventions.

### Mottling score is a strong predictor of 14-day mortality in septic patients whatever vasopressor doses and other tissue perfusion parameters [^921ee417]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Oliguria is a controversial predictor of outcome in ICU setting. As a marker of organ perfusion-related dysfunction, it could be an interesting target during resuscitation. It has been found that oliguria may precede the increase of plasma creatinine and acute kidney injury development. However, mechanisms that regulate urinary output are complex. If oliguria seems to be related to acute kidney development, there were conflicting data on its direct role on mortality. In addition, urine output as a goal of resuscitation therapy during sepsis has been no longer recommended in the last version of the "Surviving sepsis campaign". In the present study, we observed that oliguria is a strong predictor of death. We also found that early alteration of urine output (i.e. during the first 6 h of management) is associated with mortality. When we modeled urine output as a continuous variable, its effect on mortality increased at threshold of 0.5 ml/Kg/h, paving the way for future research.

### High dose interleukin-2 (aldesleukin)-expert consensus on best management practices-2014 [^1e87e0e6]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Oliguria/creatinine

Holding

Pre-established criteria at each center are used to determine if urine output and serum creatinine are adequate to administer another dose. Some centers require urine output of 30 ml/hour, others 80–160 ml/8 hour shift. Some centers delay a dose of IL-2 when urine output has fallen, and resume IL-2 when urine output is evident. Some centers will only delay a dose if oliguria is accompanied by other signs of significant toxicity, such as fluid overload that does not allow further fluid replacement. Elevated serum creatinine concentration alone is usually not a reason for delaying a dose of IL-2, since it is primarily a reflection of hypotension, capillary leak, and/or oliguria. However, many centers set a threshold level for serum creatinine, and will stop IL-2 treatment if the level rises above 3 to 5 mg/dL. Dialysis is not necessary, as renal function returns upon cessation of IL-2 administration.

Stopping

Each center will set its criteria for tolerability of oliguria and/or serum creatinine level with which to hold or stop IL-2. This is related to the degree of capillary leak, the rate of rise of serum creatinine, the degree of oliguria, and responsiveness to holding a dose of IL-2.

Diarrhea

Holding

If diarrhea becomes very frequent, such as 5–6 movements/day of any volume, most centers would delay IL-2 therapy to allow some recovery. If diarrhea improves with delaying doses, IL-2 may continue, but if as a consequence of the diarrhea, the patient develops local pain and irritation and fluid loss and electrolyte imbalance are apparent holding another dose of IL-2 is prudent. If there is concern about infection, treatment may have to be discontinued. Electrolytes should be replaced as needed, particularly bicarbonate, prior to resuming IL-2. Patients who have had prior treatment with ipilimumab and develop diarrhea while on high dose IL-2 should be evaluated for inflammatory colitis.

Stopping

Rarely, continued large volume or frequent diarrhea despite medical intervention requires stopping IL-2. Electrolyte loss may not be compensated by replacement and due to the depressed renal function overshoots of potassium are to be avoided. If there is voluminous diarrhea, examination for hemorrhagic diarrhea or C. difficile toxin should be obtained. This is rare, but must be ruled out in this setting.

### Targeting urine output and 30-day mortality in goal-directed therapy: a systematic review with meta-analysis and meta-regression [^8a118cfc]. BMC Anesthesiology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Textbooks and guidelines frequently recommend urine output as a parameter to guide fluid administration, since decreased organ perfusion may decrease urine output in an attempt to maintain intravascular volume. However, a suboptimal hemodynamic status is not always the cause of oliguria. In recent years, the concept of an association between intraoperative urine output and postoperative acute kidney injury has been challenged. As a result, advocacy for permissive oliguria has increased, for example to include permissive oliguria in the early recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols.

Our group has previously published meta-analyses concerning the effects of targeting urine output on acute renal failure or acute kidney injury. A frequent remark on these meta-analyses was that while targeting urine output may not have an effect on preventing acute kidney injury, there is increasing evidence that reduced urine output is a risk factor for mortality. Especially in critically ill patients, the occurrence and severity of oliguria is associated with an increase in mortality. Whether the association between urine output and outcome is due to a causal relation or rather an epiphenomenon is yet to be determined. Nevertheless, fluids and vasoactive medication are often administered to patients with a decrease in urine output to guarantee and maintain adequate perfusion. However, whether urine output is a useful target for fluid management remains doubtful, especially when direct measures related to cardiac output and oxygen delivery are available.

We hypothesize that including urine output as a target does not decrease 30-day mortality in perioperative and critical care. This study aims to investigate whether including urine output as a target in fluid management protocols reduces 30-day mortality in perioperative and critical care.

### Targeting urine output and 30-day mortality in goal-directed therapy: a systematic review with meta-analysis and meta-regression [^9b8d4566]. BMC Anesthesiology (2017). Low credibility.

This meta-analysis supports the hypothesis that oliguria is likely an epiphenomenon rather than a modifiable risk factor. In a perioperative setting, low urine output is common in the first 24 h after surgery and in the absence of other issues it does not reliably reflect fluid status. Moreover, urine output is influenced by factors other than the hemodynamic status. Surgical trauma and physical stress in critical illness cause the release of neuro-hormonal factors which influence glomerular filtration pressure or water reabsorption in the collecting duct, such as catecholamines, arginine vasopressin and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. While these neuro-hormonal factors are also upregulated in hypovolemia resulting in oliguria, the perioperative or critical care setting itself does promote the occurrence of oliguria. Additionally, anesthetic techniques and medication can affect neuro-hormonal factors as well as vasomotor tone. Moreover, using urine output to guide fluid management is inherently flawed due to the delayed response. Evaluating the urinary response to a fluid challenge is generally possible after at least 15–30 min, and is limited by the lack of a clear dose-response relationship. In contrast, hemodynamic parameters such as cardiac output are dynamic variables which are influenced within a short interval after a fluid challenge is given and for most variables a dose-response relationship has been given. Thus, the primary cause of oliguria may not be affected by fluid administration, or may already have been resolved by acting on another target.

In light of this, the use of permissive oliguria has already been advocated in ERAS protocols, primarily to avoid excess fluid loading. In patients managed by hemodynamic targets with a better correlation to fluid status, the occurrence of oliguria due to hemodynamic causes is unlikely, which favors the exclusion of urine output as a target for fluid resuscitation. Considering this, the current paradigm that urine output reflects renal injury and – perhaps indirectly – increases mortality needs to be revisited. In most – if not all – cases, oliguria is most likely an epiphenomenon of an underlying problem. A recent study showed that after adjusting for confounders while intraoperative urine output was not associated with postoperative morbidity, total intraoperative fluid intake and postoperative fluid boluses for hypotension and low urine output were associated with an increase in postoperative morbidity. This strongly suggests that urine output should not be a target in a fluid management protocol to improve outcome.

### Significance of oliguria in critically ill patients with chronic liver disease [^f62979c2]. Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

Clinical guidelines recommend using Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria for the diagnosis and classification of acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients with chronic liver disease (CLD). Concerns have been raised about the use of urine output (UO) criteria in CLD. We examined the significance of oliguria meeting the urine output criteria for AKI (AKI-UO) and examined its association with clinical outcomes in CLD patients. Using an 8-year clinical database from a large university medical center, 3458 patients with CLD were identified. AKI occurred in 2854 (82.5%) patients when they fulfilled any KDIGO criteria. When serum creatinine (SC) and UO criteria were used, 604 patients (17.5%) had no evidence of AKI and had the lowest hospital mortality rate (5%). Using AKI-UO criteria alone, 2103 patients (60.8%) were classified as stage 2–3 AKI. When only SC criteria were applied, 1281 (61%) of those patients with stage 2–3 AKI-UO were misclassified as either no AKI or AKI stage 1. Patients reclassified with AKI according to UO criteria (AKI-UO) had nearly a 3-fold increased rate of hospital mortality compared with patients without any AKI (14.6% versus 5%; P < 0.001) and more than a 50% increased mortality compared with stage 1 AKI-SC (14.6% versus 9%; P < 0.001). Patients with transient oliguria (AKI-UO stage 1) had increased mortality rates compared with patients without oliguria (14.9% versus 6.9%; P < 0.001).

Conclusion

CLD patients have a high incidence of AKI. Compared with creatinine criteria alone, incorporating UO into the diagnostic criteria increased the measured incidence of AKI. Stage 2–3 AKI-UO has a high negative impact on hospital mortality. (Hepatology 2017;66:1592–1600).

### Non-interventional follow-up versus fluid bolus in RESPONSE to oliguria in hemodynamically stable critically ill patients: a randomized controlled pilot trial [^47dbf5ca]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Urine output less than 0.5 mL/kg/h for 6 h is considered as one of the criteria of AKI and oliguria even though more strict thresholds have been proposed. We chose to use doubling of urine output as the primary outcome, as this outcome had been previously used in a pharmacological study. However, we acknowledge that this outcome is arbitrary, and it can become "positive" even though the actual increase in urine output would be very small. Therefore, we reported also the change in urine output and the duration of oliguria. All these outcomes signaled that patients in the FU group produced slightly smaller amounts of urine; however, the urine output response in the FB group was very modest considering that the fluid bolus volume was 500 mL. Consequently, the fluid balance in the FB group significantly increased. Furthermore, the urine output between the groups was similar from 3 h after the intervention onward indicating a very short improvement in the urine output. The results in the subgroups of septic patients and AKI patients corroborated those of the main analysis. As this was a pilot trial concentrating on physiological effects of fluid bolus, the trial was not powered to detect differences in patient-centered outcomes such as duration of AKI or survival. Our trial did not reveal harms related to smaller amount of given fluid. Follow-up approach on oliguria was feasible and well tolerated. Notably, another pilot trial among patients with AKI found a restricted approach to fluid therapy aiming at neutral fluid balance to be safe. Considering the harms of fluid accumulation, it is unlikely that critically ill, hemodynamically stable patients with oliguria benefit from fluid bolus therapy administered to correct oliguria. Importantly, the FU approach did not associate with worsening of physiological parameters, acid–base balance, or more severe AKI. Finally, AKI is a heterogeneous syndrome and therefore tailoring fluid therapy according the individual course of disease, coexisting comorbidities, other ICU syndromes and ongoing therapies might be the best approach.

### Association of oliguria with acute kidney injury diagnosis, severity assessment, and mortality among patients with critical illness [^d2eb59dd]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Reference Baseline sCr Level

The reference baseline sCr level was defined as the lowest sCr level recorded within 12 months of ICU admission. Values measured within 24 hours of unscheduled admissions were excluded because they were deemed more likely to represent acute conditions rather than a baseline value. In the absence of eligible sCr levels measured before ICU admission, we considered the lowest value available during the ICU stay after excluding values measured during KRT and within an arbitrary period of 3 days after KRT. In addition, to account for the temporality inherent to KDIGO sCr criteria (see next section), 48-hour and 7-day sliding windows were used to define dynamic baselines.

AKI Diagnosis and Staging According to sCr Criteria

According to KDIGO criteria, AKI was defined as an increase in sCr level to at least 1.5 times the baseline value within a 7-day period, or an increase in sCr level by at least 0.3 mg/dL (to convert to μmol/L, multiply by 88.4) within a 48-hour time frame. Stage 1 was defined as a peak to baseline difference of at least 0.3 mg/dL or a peak to baseline ratio of 1.5 to 1.9; stage 2, by a peak to baseline ratio of 2.0 to 2.9; and stage 3, by a peak to baseline ratio of at least 3.0, an sCr level of at least 4.0 mg/dL, or the receipt of KRT. Staging was considered only if time rules of AKI definition were fulfilled.

UO Assessment

For every single hour of each ICU stay, we computed a 6-hour mean corresponding to the mean UO measured within the previous 6 hours. Similarly, we calculated a 12-hour mean (mean UO measured within the previous 12 hours) and a 24-hour mean (mean UO within the previous 24 hours). All values were adjusted to the patient's body weight (units in mL/kg/h). By definition, the 6-hour mean hourly UO values could not have been computed for the first 5 hours of ICU admission; the 12-hour mean hourly OU values, for the first 11 hours of ICU admission; and the 24-hour mean hourly UO values, for the first 23 hours of ICU admission. Therefore, AKI could not have been diagnosed using UO criteria before 6 hours of ICU stay.

### Definition of hourly urine output influences reported incidence and staging of acute kidney injury [^29bf17ce]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

The increased sensitivity and high false positive rate of using mean UO may also be influenced by clinical factors such as urinary obstruction or inadequate fluid resuscitation which can affect UO irrespective of renal function or injury. This observation was also made by Ralib et al. who criticised KDIGO UO criteria as being too liberal. In order to reflect glomerular filtration the patient must be adequately hydrated before UO can be useful. The AKIN classification addressed this point but in practice it is difficult to determine "adequate" hydration. Changes in UO can be physiological and not represent disease but rather an auto regulatory response. A study by Solomon in a UK intensive care unit demonstrated that 22% junior doctors had physiological oliguria and were more likely to be oliguric than their patients.

The different effects in cardiac surgery and ICU of the two methods of measuring UO suggest that UO is affected by clinical variables in different patient groups. It is important that this is recognised particularly in view of the fact that mean UO is commonly used in most medical settings due to practicalities of patient management (avoiding unnecessary urinary catheterisation), clinical staffing and cost constraints. To our knowledge no previous study has compared the use of UO in ICU with patients undergoing cardiac surgery in order to diagnose AKI.

Limitations of this study included its retrospective design (as part of an observational study investigating novel AKI biomarkers) and the fact that it was conducted in a single centre, although two separate clinical cohorts were studied. Use of SCr as gold standard for AKI definition is a well-documented limitation of most studies of AKI incidence, as SCr is accepted to be a late and poor marker of AKI. In addition, diuretic use was relatively high in the setting of cardiac surgery. Dose and frequency of diuretic administration may confound analyses involving urine output. We have not compared our results with markers of tubular injury or function as 'biomarkers of AKI' because these have been validated only in certain clinical settings and are not yet in routine use.

### Anuria and oliguria… [^405c5ac8]. publications.aap.org (2023). Medium credibility.

Key Points Oliguria, decreased urine output, is more common than anuria, absence of urine output. Prerenal causes are more common than renal or postrenal causes for acute kidney injury. History, physical examination, urine analysis, serum electrolyte values, serum blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels, urinary electrolyte values, and renal ultrasonography help determine if oliguria/anuria is prerenal, renal, or postrenal in etiology. In prerenal oliguria/anuria, volume status should be determined and fluid resuscitation initiated immediately. Patients with renal etiology for oliguria/anuria should be referred to a nephrologist for further management. Patients with postrenal obstructive lesions should be referred to a urologist for further management.

Renal replacement therapy initiation timing in sepsis-associated acute kidney injury — In adults with sepsis or septic shock and AKI, with no definitive indications for renal replacement therapy, we suggest against using renal replacement therapy. Weak recommendation, moderate quality of evidence. Evidence informing this includes a new RCT that included 488 patients with AKI and septic shock and was stopped early after the second planned interim analysis for futility; eligibility required septic shock within 48 hours of the onset of vasopressor therapy and AKI criteria including oliguria (< 0.3 mL/kg/hr for ≥ 24 hours) or anuria for 12 hours or more. The STARRT-AKI trial randomized 3,000 participants and demonstrated no difference in mortality, with no differential effect in the a priori sepsis subgroup of 1,689 patients. An updated metaanalysis found no effect of the timing of initiation of renal replacement therapy on mortality and renal recovery, and overall the balance of effects favored delayed rather than early initiation of RRT, principally driven by a higher rate of CVAD infection in the early initiation.

Definitions and clinical endpoints

The definitions of AKI and AKI classification were depended on the serum creatinine and urine output criteria proposed by Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO). New-onset AKI was defined as acute kidney injury occurred within 72hours after ICU admission. If a patient could be diagnosed with AKI at the time of admission (elevated serum creatinine or oliguria within the first 6 hours after admission that met the KDIGO criteria), it is considered that AKI was already occurred before ICU admission, and this patient couldn't be diagnosed as new-onset AKI.CKD was defined according to the definition of National Kidney Foundation as estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60 ml/min/1.73 m 2 for at least 3 months irrespective of the cause. GFR was estimated with the Cockcroft-Gault formula. The baseline creatinine was defined as follows: if at least five values were available the median of all values available from 6 months to 6 days prior to enrollment was used. Otherwise, the lowest value in the 5 days prior to enrollment was used. If no pre-enrollment creatinine was available or the emergency patient' s serum creatinine was abnormal at the time of admission, the baseline creatinine was estimated using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation assuming that baseline eGFR is 75 ml/min per 1.73 m². The diagnosis of sepsis and septic shock was according to the sepsis 3.0 definition of the American College of Chest Physicians/ Society of Critical Care Medicine criteria. Transient AKI was defined as kidney injury recovered within 48 h. Persistent AKI was defined as acute kidney injury more than 48 h. Recovery of AKI was defined as the absence of any stage of AKI by either serum creatinine or urine output criteria. For example, a patient with stage 2 AKI would have to have a decrease in serum creatinine to less than 150% of baseline, and be free of periods of oliguria longer than 6 h. When 48 h follow-up was not possible due to death or discharge from ICU, AKI was defined as persistent if patients met KDIGO criteria for their last measurement, otherwise as transient. Weaning of RRT was defined as the cessation of RRT within 28 days, and requiring no further support for at least 7 days. Major surgery was defined as the surgery classification of grade 3 or 4 identified by the National Health Commission of China.

The primary endpoint was 28-day mortality. Secondary endpoints were weaning of RRT, length of ICU stay and hospital stay, hospital mortality.

### Incidence, timing and outcome of AKI in critically ill patients varies with the definition used and the addition of urine output criteria [^12de6d11]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

AKIN and KDIGO define a less ill population with a better outcome, compared to RIFLE. Urine output criteria detect patients with AKI 11 h earlier than serum creatinine criteria and gives approximately doubling of AKI incidences in critically ill patients, but most of these patients will never reach creatinine criteria. Consensus definitions have improved research opportunities, however the definitions used, addition of urine output criteria and the patients under study all influence AKI incidences and possibly outcomes.

Renal replacement therapy timing and use without definitive indications — adults with sepsis or septic shock and AKI: we suggest against using renal replacement therapy when there are no definitive indications for renal replacement therapy (Weak recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). A new RCT comparing early versus delayed RRT in septic shock with AKI included 488 patients and was stopped early for futility; eligible patients had septic shock within 48 hours of vasopressor therapy onset and AKI defined as oliguria (< 0.3 mL/kg/hr for ≥ 24 hours), anuria for 12 hours or more, or a serum creatinine increase of ≥ 0.5 mg/dL. The STARRT-AKI trial randomized 3,000 participants and demonstrated no difference in mortality between accelerated and "standard" RRT, with no differential effect in the a priori sepsis subgroup of 1,689 patients. An updated metaanalysis observed no effect of initiation timing on mortality and renal recovery, and overall the balance of effects favored delayed rather than early initiation, driven by a higher rate of central venous access device (CVAD) infection in the "early" initiation.

### The clinical relevance of oliguria in the critically ill patient: analysis of a large observational database [^31087aaa]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Persistence of oliguria during ICU stay

A total of 1349 patients had at least one additional urine output measurement recorded during their ICU stay. Oliguria was transient in 390 (28.9%) of these patients, prolonged in 141 (10.5%), and permanent in 818 (60.6%) (Table 4). ICU mortality was 7.1% when oliguria was transient, significantly lower than in the patients without oliguria (11.5%, p = 0.037); rates were 10.9% when oliguria was prolonged and 28.9% when permanent (Table 4).

RRT was used in the ICU in 48 (12.3%), 63 (44.7%), and 273 (33.4%) patients with transient, prolonged, and permanent oliguria, respectively; 102 (19%) patients with permanent oliguria died in the ICU without receiving RRT. RRT was started within 24 h in 72.4% of patients with oliguria (75.0% vs 73.0% vs 71.8% in patients with transient, prolonged, and permanent oliguria, respectively). Among patients receiving RRT, ICU mortality was higher in non-oliguric patients than in those with transient or prolonged oliguria but lower than in those with permanent oliguria (Table 4). The maximum serum creatinine concentration was higher in patients with prolonged and permanent oliguria than in those with transient oliguria (Table 4). The mean daily fluid balance during the ICU stay was significantly higher in patients with permanent oliguria than in those with transient or prolonged oliguria (Table 4).

### Non-interventional follow-up versus fluid bolus in RESPONSE to oliguria in hemodynamically stable critically ill patients: a randomized controlled pilot trial [^7da96fa9]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Fluid bolus therapy is a common intervention to improve urine output. Data concerning the effect of a fluid bolus on oliguria originate mainly from observational studies and remain controversial regarding the actual benefit of such therapy. We compared the effect of a follow-up approach without fluid bolus to a 500 mL fluid bolus on urine output in hemodynamically stable critically ill patients with oliguria at least for 2 h (urine output < 0.5 mL/kg/h) in randomized setting.

Methods

We randomized 130 patients in 1:1 fashion to receive either (1) non-interventional follow-up (FU) for 2 h or (2) 500 mL crystalloid fluid bolus (FB) administered over 30 min. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who doubled their urine output, defined as 2-h urine output post-randomization divided by urine output 2 h pre-randomization. The outcomes were adjusted for the stratification variables (presence of sepsis or AKI) using two-tailed regression. Obtained odds ratios were converted to risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). The between-group difference in the continuous variables was compared using mean or median regression and expressed with 95% CIs.

Results

Altogether 10 (15.9%) of 63 patients in the FU group and 22 (32.8%) of 67 patients in FB group doubled their urine output during the 2-h period, RR (95% CI) 0.49 (0.23–0.71), P = 0.026. Median [IQR] change in individual urine output 2 h post-randomization compared to 2 h pre-randomization was − 7 [− 19 to 17] mL in the FU group and 19[0–53] mL in the FB group, median difference (95% CI) − 23 (− 36 to − 10) mL, P = 0.001. Median [IQR] duration of oliguria in the FU group was 4 [2–8] h and in the FB group 2 [0–6] h, median difference (95%CI) 2 (0–4) h, P = 0.038. Median [IQR] cumulative fluid balance on study day was lower in the FU group compared to FB group, 678 [518–1029] mL versus 1071 [822–1505] mL, respectively, median difference (95%CI) − 387 (− 635 to − 213) mL, P < 0.001.

Conclusions

Follow-up approach to oliguria compared to administering a fluid bolus of 500 mL crystalloid in oliguric patients improved urine output less frequently but lead to lower cumulative fluid balance.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for acute kidney injury [^b3eac921]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Medium credibility.

KDOQI US commentary on the KDIGO acute kidney injury (AKI) guideline states that the KDIGO definition and staging criteria are "appropriate for defining the epidemiology of AKI and in the design of clinical trials", but concludes "there is insufficient evidence to support their widespread application to clinical care in the United States". The panel "generally concurred with the remainder of the KDIGO guidelines that are focused on the prevention and pharmacologic and dialytic management of AKI", while emphasizing "the dearth of clinical trial evidence to provide strong evidence-based recommendations" and "the continued absence of effective therapies beyond hemodynamic optimization and avoidance of nephrotoxins for the prevention and treatment of AKI". For clinical context, AKI "represents the sudden loss of kidney function, generally occurring over the course of hours to days and resulting in the retention of metabolic waste products and the development of volume overload and electrolyte and acid-base abnormalities".

### Early-phase cumulative hypotension duration and severe-stage progression in oliguric acute kidney injury with and without sepsis: an observational study [^a781539f]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Methods

Study design, setting, and patients

This observational study reviewed data from all consecutive patients admitted to the ICU of the Jikei University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan, from January 2010 through December 2014. The study protocol was approved by the respective medical institutional review boards of Kyoto University (approval number R0432) and Jikei University (approval number 27–299). Because of the retrospective approach of this study and de-identification of personal data, the boards waived the need for informed consent.

We examined data from consecutive patients aged ≥ 18 years who had not undergone maintenance dialysis and who stayed in the ICU for at least 24 h after the diagnosis of oliguric AKI, which was defined as stage-1 oliguric AKI, urine output < 0.5 mL/kg/h for 6 h consecutively (Table 1), according to the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria. If patients with oliguric AKI were admitted to the ICU twice or more during the study period, only data from the first ICU admission were included. We excluded patients in whom blood pressure was not measured with an interval of < 1 h during the 24-h period after oliguric AKI diagnosis, and those who died within 72 h after ICU admission. Patients who had been admitted after vascular surgery were excluded because they were frequently treated with higher target levels of blood pressure in the ICU to avoid spinal ischemia and paraplegia. We also excluded patients in whom renal replacement therapy (RRT) was initiated within 6 h of oliguric AKI diagnosis.

### Advocating for the inclusion of kidney health outcomes in neonatal research: best practice recommendations by the neonatal kidney collaborative [^89f9d448]. Journal of Perinatology (2024). Medium credibility.

To overcome some of these challenges, Jetton et al. developed modified Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcome (KDIGO) criteria for neonatal AKI. These consensus criteria were developed at the National Institutes of Health/National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIH/NIDDK) sponsored interdisciplinary workshop on Neonatal AKI in 2013 and have subsequently been utilized to define AKI in neonates in research and clinical care. Although many other definitions for neonatal AKI exist, the consistent use of the neonatal modified KDIGO AKI definition has fostered greater understanding of the incidence and impact of neonatal AKI.

UOP criteria are also included in the modified KDIGO criteria for neonatal AKI. We encourage the collection and use of UOP data to diagnose and stage AKI. Shortly after preterm birth in clinical practice, UOP is recorded in a rigorous manner. However, it is often difficult to obtain reliable urine quantification due to the presence of stool, and potential for leakage or evaporation. Invasive techniques such as catheters can cause harm and any adhesive devices, such as urine collection bags, are discouraged in immature neonates. UOP data usually are missing for a portion of the hospitalization and the accuracy of the UOP data have been questionable in some retrospective studies. Therefore, some retrospective studies have chosen to only use the serum creatinine criteria alone. It is important to recognize that eliminating the UOP criteria from the AKI definition will result in a lower detection rate of AKI. When UOP is meticulously measured, the relationship between AKI and mortality increases substantially. In preterm infants, even relative oliguria with UOP < 1.5–2 mL/kg/hour is associated with increased mortality; future studies may identify new UOP thresholds that have even higher sensitivity for neonatal AKI diagnoses.

Inclusion criteria

AKI was diagnosed according to the criteria and protocols of the 2005 Acute Kidney Injury Network. 1) The course of the disease is less than three months, with any abnormalities in blood, urine, and tissue attributable to the imaging findings of impaired renal structure and function. 2) An abrupt (within 48 hours) reduction in kidney function is defined as an absolute increase in serum creatinine of at least 0.3 mg/dl (≥ 26.4 μmol/l), a percentage increase in serum creatinine of at least 50% (1.5-fold from baseline), or a reduction in urine output (documented oliguria of less than 0.5 ml/kg per hour for more than 6 hours).

Exclusion criteria: 1) Children who were diagnosed with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on the first visit. 2) Children who were born with kidney injuries such as congenital malformations or birth defects. 3) Children with genetic metabolic diseases. 4) Children with known CKD whose AKI occurred during remission.

The classification/staging system for AKI was defined based on the following criteria:

Stage 1: Increase in serum creatinine of at least 0.3 mg/dl (≥ 26.4 μmol/l), an increase of at least 150% to 200% (1.5- to 2-fold) from baseline, or urine output below 0.5 ml/kg per hour for more than 6 hours.

Stage 2: Increase in serum creatinine of more than 200% to 300% (> 2- to 3-fold) from baseline or urine output of less than 0.5 ml/kg per hour for more than 12 hours.

Stage 3: Increase in serum creatinine of more than 300% (> 3-fold) from baseline or serum creatinine of more than or equal to 4.0 mg/dl (≥ 354 μmol/l) with an acute increase of at least 0.5 mg/dl (44 μmol/l), or urine output less than 0.3 ml/kg per hour for 24 hours or anuria for 12 hours.
