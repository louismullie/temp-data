## Question

What is the management of chronic kidney disease?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the management of chronic kidney disease. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define CKD and stage it correctly. Then, I should verify the overarching management principles and risk stratification. Next, I will examine lifestyle interventions, followed by pharmacologic strategies for blood pressure, glycemic control, and cardiovascular risk. After that, I need to check complication management, including mineral and bone disorder, anemia, acid-base and electrolytes, and volume status. I will then consider referral thresholds and models of care, including multidisciplinary and self-management. Finally, I should review special populations, implementation barriers, and a concise synthesis that aligns with current guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the definition and staging framework, because everything downstream depends on getting this right. CKD is defined by a persistent reduction in eGFR below 60 mL/min/1.73 m² or markers of kidney damage, such as albuminuria, for at least 3 months, and staging uses the cause–GFR–albuminuria (CGA) classification to guide risk and management decisions, so I need to ensure chronicity and accurately classify GFR and albuminuria before proceeding [^3f1828f6] [^7a3ef866].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about chronicity; I should double-check for acute kidney disease or acute kidney injury masquerading as CKD. If the duration is uncertain, repeating eGFR and albuminuria testing and correlating with clinical context helps distinguish AKD from CKD, and delaying diagnosis solely to confirm chronicity can postpone beneficial therapy, so I need to balance confirmation with timely intervention when suspicion is high [^a6af8f3a].

> Next, I should review the overarching management principles. A comprehensive, risk-based strategy that addresses both CKD progression and cardiovascular complications is recommended, with early initiation of disease-modifying therapies and attention to patient-centered, equitable care; I need to ensure that my plan integrates these principles rather than treating risk factors in isolation [^fb45c8d9] [^7f869a71].

> I will now examine lifestyle interventions, since they are foundational and often underimplemented. Moderate-intensity physical activity to at least 150 minutes per week or as tolerated, smoking cessation, weight management toward a BMI less than 25 kg/m² when feasible, and a predominantly plant-based diet with sodium restriction to less than 2 g/day and protein around 0.8 g/kg/day in CKD G3–G5 are supported; wait, let me verify the sodium target — yes, KDIGO 2024 aligns with less than 2 g/day of sodium, and I should tailor these to culture, comorbidities, and adherence barriers [^49b3f12b] [^dc0af5ee].

> For blood pressure management, I should confirm first-line therapy choices. In CKD with albuminuria, ACE inhibitors or ARBs are preferred because they reduce CKD progression and cardiovascular events; in those without albuminuria, other antihypertensives are reasonable, and I should target less than 130/80 mmHg if tolerated, while individualizing for frailty, falls risk, and comorbidities; I need to remember not to reflexively stop RAAS blockade for hyperkalemia without addressing modifiable contributors and considering potassium binders [^f9505598] [^cce69d8b].

> Let me think about glycemic control in diabetes, because this is where kidney-protective pharmacotherapy has evolved. I should confirm that SGLT2 inhibitors are first-line for type 2 diabetes with CKD given robust reductions in kidney failure and cardiovascular events, with metformin continued when eGFR permits, and layering GLP-1 receptor agonists and, when indicated, finerenone for additional cardiorenal benefit; I need to ensure I am aligning with KDIGO 2022 and the ADA/KDIGO consensus [^97543df9] [^69725d55].

> For cardiovascular risk reduction beyond blood pressure, I should verify statin use. Statins are recommended for adults with CKD older than 50 years to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk, and I should calculate ASCVD risk and consider intensification when indicated; I need to ensure I am not overgeneralizing to younger patients without diabetes, where evidence is weaker [^b4f476fc].

> Now, I need to check complication management systematically. For CKD-mineral and bone disorder, I should monitor calcium, phosphate, PTH, and vitamin D, correct vitamin D deficiency using general-population strategies, and base treatment decisions on trends rather than single values; for anemia, I should evaluate iron deficiency and consider erythropoiesis-stimulating agents when indicated, recognizing that early correction may improve outcomes; for metabolic acidosis, I should consider oral bicarbonate in CKD G3–G5 when serum bicarbonate is below 22 mmol/L; for hyperkalemia, I should individualize with diet, medication review, diuretics, and potassium binders rather than automatically stopping RAAS inhibitors; for volume overload, I should use diuretics and sodium restriction, tailoring to kidney function and comorbidities [^f591adfc] [^a2d90480] [^011a94ee] [^cce69d8b].

> I should confirm referral thresholds and the role of risk prediction. Patients with eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m², albuminuria greater than or equal to 300 mg/day, or a rapid decline in eGFR should be referred to nephrology, and the Kidney Failure Risk Equation can help identify high-risk individuals for earlier referral; I need to ensure I am not delaying referral in those with accelerating disease [^3f1828f6] [^d865ac4f].

> Next, I should review models of care. Multidisciplinary, patient-centered care with dietary counseling, medication management, education, and psychosocial support improves outcomes, and team-based approaches are emphasized in KDIGO 2024; wait, let me verify whether EHR-based population management improved progression — no, a cluster RCT showed improved process measures but no reduction in CKD progression, so I should not overpromise on digital-only strategies without comprehensive clinical support [^8c25050b] [^18cca531].

> I need to ensure patient education and self-management are embedded, because adherence and activation materially change outcomes. Effective education should be standardized, culturally tailored, and include care partners where appropriate, and self-management interventions can improve blood pressure, proteinuria, and exercise capacity even if hard renal endpoints are not always affected in short-term trials; I should double-check that I am setting realistic goals and providing tools to sustain behavior change [^34195371] [^937b18d0].

> But wait, what about special populations and implementation realities. In older adults, I should individualize targets given competing risks and frailty; in low-resource settings, I should prioritize cost-effective primary care–based interventions and address access barriers, noting that nearly a third of the global population lacks timely access to quality medications; I should also screen high-risk groups such as those with diabetes, hypertension, or family history, and consider targeted community screening where feasible [^bf8a334c] [^0ccdeaa8] [^3e487aab].

> Let me reconsider the synthesis to ensure internal consistency. Management of CKD centers on early detection with eGFR and albuminuria, accurate staging with the CGA framework, and a comprehensive, risk-stratified approach that layers lifestyle interventions, blood pressure control with RAAS blockade when albuminuria is present, glycemic optimization with SGLT2 inhibitors and adjuncts in diabetes, cardiovascular risk reduction with statins, and vigilant complication management, all delivered through coordinated multidisciplinary care with patient education and timely nephrology referral; I should confirm that this aligns with KDIGO 2024 and contemporary primary care guidance, which it does [^fb45c8d9] [^b4f476fc] [^d865ac4f].

CKD management centers on **early detection** with eGFR and albuminuria [^9ca81c01], **risk-based care** using the CGA framework [^7a3ef866], and **comprehensive treatment** to slow progression and reduce complications [^fb45c8d9]. Core elements include **blood pressure control** (target < 130/80 mmHg if tolerated) with ACE inhibitors/ARBs when albuminuria is present [^f9505598], **glycemic control** with metformin and SGLT2 inhibitors for type 2 diabetes [^97543df9], and **lifestyle measures** (sodium restriction, plant-forward diet, 150 minutes/week of activity, weight management, smoking cessation) [^49b3f12b]. Monitor for complications (anemia, CKD-MBD, hyperkalemia, acidosis) and adjust medications for kidney function; refer to nephrology when eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m², albuminuria ≥ 300 mg/g, or rapid progression [^3f1828f6]. Multidisciplinary care and patient education improve outcomes [^8c25050b] [^34195371].

### Executive summary of the KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease: known knowns and known unknowns [^8aa59847]. Kidney International (2024). Medium credibility.

The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Clinical Practice Guideline for the Evaluation and Management of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) updates the KDIGO 2012 guideline and has been developed with patient partners, clinicians, and researchers around the world, using robust methodology. This update, based on a substantially broader base of evidence than has previously been available, reflects an exciting time in nephrology. New therapies and strategies have been tested in large and diverse populations that help to inform care; however, this guideline is not intended for people receiving dialysis nor those who have a kidney transplant. The document is sensitive to international considerations, CKD across the lifespan, and discusses special considerations in implementation. The scope includes chapters dedicated to the evaluation and risk assessment of people with CKD, management to delay CKD progression and its complications, medication management and drug stewardship in CKD, and optimal models of CKD care. Treatment approaches and actionable guideline recommendations are based on systematic reviews of relevant studies and appraisal of the quality of the evidence and the strength of recommendations which followed the "Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation" (GRADE) approach. The limitations of the evidence are discussed. The guideline also provides practice points, which serve to direct clinical care or activities for which a systematic review was not conducted, and it includes useful infographics and describes an important research agenda for the future. It targets a broad audience of people with CKD and their healthcare, while being mindful of implications for policy and payment.

### Self-management interventions for chronic kidney disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^bdc7fe69]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a progressive disease that leads to End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD: maintenance dialysis or kidney transplantation), cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Approximately 440,000 patients begin dialysis each year worldwide, and annual costs of dialysis and kidney transplants range between US $35,000 and 100,000. This can strain healthcare budgets. Clinical decision making for CKD is challenging due to the heterogeneity of kidney diseases, variability in rates of disease progression, and the competing risk of cardiovascular mortality, the most common cause of death worldwide. Furthermore, CKD is not included in the list of priorities for most non-communicable diseases (NCD), and few countries have clear policies or public programs to prevent and control CKD.

CKD management includes slowing the progression to ESRD and decreasing the risk of cardiovascular complications through management of kidney function and CKD progression risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes. In addition to medication, managing risk factors is important clinically because it can prevent, or at least minimize, the likelihood of further renal injury. Long-term CKD management requires a high level of patient involvement, both in decision-making and in the implementation of care. There is growing recognition that patients want to be involved as equal partners in their care. The goal of self-management is to identify strategies that can be used to help patients manage their condition(s) while leading active and productive lives. This includes goal setting, problem solving, symptom management, and shared decision-making, and these strategies are applicable for a diverse population. For patients with CKD, this encompasses a spectrum of behaviors ranging from adherence to medication, exercise, and diet recommendations (self-management maintenance) to recognition of early warning signs, and self-adjustment of home-care regimens.

Despite an established tradition of patient self-management of ESRD, and self-management being a well-established treatment strategy for other chronic conditions such as diabetes and hypertension, evidence to support its use for CKD non-dialysis is limited. To lighten the economic burden of ESRD, strategies must be implemented to prevent the progression from early-stage CKD. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we synthesized results from RCTs to evaluate the effects of self-management intervention on major renal outcomes and mortality in non-dialysis adults with CKD. We also assessed effect modification by proteinuria and blood pressure.

KDIGO 2024 chronic kidney disease (CKD) guideline — Practice Point 3.1.1 states to treat people with CKD with a comprehensive treatment strategy to reduce risks of progression of CKD and its associated complications, noting that risk factors for CKD progression, CVD, and other CKD complications are highly interrelated and hence so is their management. Healthcare systems should aim to provide safe and proven cost-effective therapies that achieve CKD treatment and risk modification and to minimize limitations to access for people with CKD, and a key goal for healthcare providers should be to identify people at risk and to start such treatments early in the course of CKD to maximize potential benefits. Operational aims include prevention and treatment of clinical symptoms and signs (including blood pressure), appropriate monitoring and treatment of laboratory abnormalities of CKD associated with implications for health (e.g., anemia, CKD-MBD, potassium disorders, acidosis), and to minimize risk of progression to kidney failure while managing risk and appropriate treatment of complications, including cardiovascular diseases, hospitalization, gout, infections, etc.

### Chronic kidney disease [^c982bc57]. Lancet (2012). Excellent credibility.

Chronic kidney disease is a general term for heterogeneous disorders affecting kidney structure and function. The 2002 guidelines for definition and classification of this disease represented an important shift towards its recognition as a worldwide public health problem that should be managed in its early stages by general internists. Disease and management are classified according to stages of disease severity, which are assessed from glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and albuminuria, and clinical diagnosis (cause and pathology). Chronic kidney disease can be detected with routine laboratory tests, and some treatments can prevent development and slow disease progression, reduce complications of decreased GFR and risk of cardiovascular disease, and improve survival and quality of life. In this Seminar we discuss disease burden, recommendations for assessment and management, and future challenges. We emphasise clinical practice guidelines, clinical trials, and areas of uncertainty.

### Chronic kidney disease-part 2: management and its complications [^92a039d6]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2025). Medium credibility.

Due to the multifaceted aspects of kidney function, the management of CKD not only requires knowledge of kidney physiology and pathophysiology but also a keen understanding of how to diagnose, treat, and monitor the metabolic derangements and complications of reduced kidney function. In this article, we provide questions that cover a broad range of clinical scenarios that may test the clinical acumen of a kidney health professional. Each question starts with a brief clinical scenario to guide the reader. Questions are followed by a selection of answers. As in most clinical situations, a variety of tests and/or interventions may be appropriate. As knowledge on the management of kidney diseases and associated complications evolve, the optimal choice for these questions may also evolve.

### Preventing chronic kidney disease and maintaining kidney health: conclusions from a kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) controversies conference [^b21ac6f7]. Kidney International (2025). Medium credibility.

The primary focus of care for chronic kidney disease (CKD) has been managing progression, complications, and kidney failure after the development of CKD. Maintaining or restoring kidney health has received scant attention within nephrology or the broader medical community. However, promoting kidney health and preventing CKD could save millions of lives and markedly reduce health care costs.

Globally, > 800 million individuals live with CKD, and > 2 million die each year, with one-half of these deaths occurring due to lack of access to kidney replacement therapy (KRT) in the form of dialysis or transplantation. - The cost of KRT is extraordinarily high, consuming up to 3% of health care budgets in high-income countries (HICs). Approximately 40% of HICs and 70% of low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) do not provide insurance coverage for KRT, resulting in high out-of-pocket costs that can preclude adequate access to lifesaving care. Additionally, dialysis, especially hemodialysis, has an unsustainable environmental impact.

The global age-standardized mortality rate of CKD is increasing, and CKD is predicted to be the fifth leading cause of death globally by 2040. Both public health surveillance of CKD and global public health strategies to maintain kidney health are urgently needed. Efforts to address the CKD epidemic require interventions to maintain kidney health because current approaches that only address established CKD are not effectively curbing kidney failure or related conditionssuch as cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer,- and infection. Indeed, the majority of individuals die from CKD complications before reaching kidney failure.

In December of 2023, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) held a Controversies Conference to assess the state of knowledge related to CKD prevention across the lifespan. At the conference, international experts from multiple health care and scientific disciplines as well as individuals living with kidney disease focused on the evidence regarding primary prevention, considering lifestyle and pharmacologic approaches to prevent CKD onset. The potential for arresting CKD progression or inducing regression was also discussed.

### Harmonizing acute and chronic kidney disease definition and classification: report of a kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) consensus conference [^204810fc]. Kidney International (2021). Medium credibility.

Kidney disease is an important public health problem. Both acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease have been well defined and classified, leading to improved research efforts and subsequent management strategies and recommendations. For those patients with abnormalities in kidney function and/or structure who meet neither the definition of AKI nor chronic kidney disease, there remains a gap in research, care, and guidance. The term acute kidney diseases and disorders, abbreviated to acute kidney disease (AKD), has been introduced as an important construct to address this. To expand and harmonize existing definitions and to ultimately better inform research and clinical care, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) organized a consensus workshop. Multiple invitees from around the globe, representing both acute and chronic kidney disease researchers and experts, met virtually to examine existing data, and discuss key concepts related to AKD. Despite some remaining unresolved questions, conference attendees reached general consensus on the definition and classification of AKD, management strategies, and research priorities. AKD is defined by abnormalities of kidney function and/or structure with implications for health and with a duration of ≤ 3 months. AKD may include AKI, but, more importantly, also includes abnormalities in kidney function that are not as severe as AKI or that develop over a period of > 7 days. The cause(s) of AKD should be sought, and classification includes functional and structural parameters. Management of AKD is currently based on empirical considerations. A robust research agenda to enable refinement and validation of definitions and classification systems, and thus testing of interventions and strategies, is proposed.

### Early recognition and prevention of chronic kidney disease [^3e487aab]. Lancet (2010). Excellent credibility.

Chronic kidney disease is a common disorder and its prevalence is increasing worldwide. Early diagnosis on the basis of presence of proteinuria or reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate could permit early intervention to reduce the risks of cardiovascular events, kidney failure, and death that are associated with chronic kidney disease. In developed countries, screening for the disorder is most efficient when targeted at high-risk groups including elderly people and those with concomitant illness (such as diabetes, hypertension, or cardiovascular disease) or a family history of chronic kidney disease, although the role of screening in developing countries is not yet clear. Effective strategies are available to slow the progression of chronic kidney disease and reduce cardiovascular risk. Treatment of high blood pressure is recommended for all individuals with, or at risk of, chronic kidney disease. Use of angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers is preferred for patients with diabetic chronic kidney disease or those with the proteinuric non-diabetic disorder. Glycaemic control can help prevent the onset of early stages of chronic kidney disease in individuals with diabetes. Use of statins and aspirin is beneficial for most patients with chronic kidney disease who are at high cardiovascular risk, although research is needed to ascertain how to best prevent cardiovascular disease in this cohort. Models of care that facilitate delivery of the many complex aspects of treatment simultaneously could enhance management, although effects on clinical outcomes need further assessment. Novel clinical methods to better identify patients at risk of progression to later stages of chronic kidney disease, including kidney failure, are needed to target management to high-risk subgroups.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^9ca81c01]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

Evaluation of chronic kidney disease (CKD) — Practice Point 1.1.1: Test people at risk for and with chronic kidney disease (CKD) using both urine albumin measurement and assessment of glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Early detection of any chronic disease, including CKD, provides greater opportunities to reduce morbidity as treatments can be initiated earlier in the disease course, and because treatments for CKD provide benefits in reducing risk for both cardiovascular disease (CVD) and CKD progression, strategies that promote early detection of CKD should improve kidney and non–kidney-related outcomes. Knowledge of level of albuminuria and GFR also helps guide clinical decisions beyond initiating treatments specifically for CKD, and initial testing of blood and urine to detect CKD is important, with confirmatory testing if initial findings indicate the presence of abnormalities of creatinine/eGFR or albuminuria. Interviews with people who have CKD have provided evidence that many would alter their lifestyle if they received a diagnosis of CKD, and if a familial form of kidney disease is suspected, the diagnosis of the disease in one person may allow detection in other family members.

### Evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease: synopsis of the kidney disease: improving global outcomes 2012 clinical practice guideline [^b99bff5b]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Description

The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) organization developed clinical practice guidelines in 2012 to provide guidance on the evaluation, management, and treatment of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in adults and children who are not receiving renal replacement therapy.

Methods

The KDIGO CKD Guideline Development Work Group defined the scope of the guideline, gathered evidence, determined topics for systematic review, and graded the quality of evidence that had been summarized by an evidence review team. Searches of the English-language literature were conducted through November 2012. Final modification of the guidelines was informed by the KDIGO Board of Directors and a public review process involving registered stakeholders.

Recommendations

The full guideline included 110 recommendations. This synopsis focuses on 10 key recommendations pertinent to definition, classification, monitoring, and management of CKD in adults.

### Chronic kidney disease diagnosis and management: a review [^3f1828f6]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is the 16th leading cause of years of life lost worldwide. Appropriate screening, diagnosis, and management by primary care clinicians are necessary to prevent adverse CKD-associated outcomes, including cardiovascular disease, end-stage kidney disease, and death.

Observations

Defined as a persistent abnormality in kidney structure or function (eg, glomerular filtration rate [GFR] < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² or albuminuria ≥ 30 mg per 24 hours) for more than 3 months, CKD affects 8% to 16% of the population worldwide. In developed countries, CKD is most commonly attributed to diabetes and hypertension. However, less than 5% of patients with early CKD report awareness of their disease. Among individuals diagnosed as having CKD, staging and new risk assessment tools that incorporate GFR and albuminuria can help guide treatment, monitoring, and referral strategies. Optimal management of CKD includes cardiovascular risk reduction (eg, statins and blood pressure management), treatment of albuminuria (eg, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers), avoidance of potential nephrotoxins (eg, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), and adjustments to drug dosing (eg, many antibiotics and oral hypoglycemic agents). Patients also require monitoring for complications of CKD, such as hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, hyperphosphatemia, vitamin D deficiency, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and anemia. Those at high risk of CKD progression (eg, estimated GFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m², albuminuria ≥ 300 mg per 24 hours, or rapid decline in estimated GFR) should be promptly referred to a nephrologist.

Conclusions and Relevance

Diagnosis, staging, and appropriate referral of CKD by primary care clinicians are important in reducing the burden of CKD worldwide.

KDIGO 2024 chronic kidney disease guideline development — aim, scope, and evidence methods are outlined as follows: The aim of this project was to update the KDIGO 2012 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Evaluation and Management of Chronic Kidney Disease, and the processes undertaken for the development of the KDIGO 2024 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Evaluation and Management of CKD are described. This guideline adhered to international best practices for guideline development and was reported in accordance with the AGREE II reporting checklist. The KDIGO 2012 CKD guideline was reviewed by the Co-Chairs to identify topics to be included in the 2024 guideline, with scoping reviews conducted by the ERT to provide an overview of the available evidence base and to identify existing relevant systematic reviews. Protocols for each review were developed by the ERT, reviewed by the Work Group, and registered on PROSPERO, and the Risk of Bias in Systematic Reviews (ROBIS) tool was used to assess the risk of bias of the existing reviews. Details of the Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome and Study design (PICOS) of the questions are provided, searches for RCTs were conducted on PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and searches for diagnosis/prognosis studies were conducted on PubMed, Embase, and CINAHL. To improve efficiency and accuracy in the title/abstract screening process and to manage the process, search results were uploaded to a web-based screening tool, PICO Portal. KDIGO and the Co-Chairs assembled and engaged a Work Group with expertise across nephrology and related disciplines, and Johns Hopkins University was contracted as the ERT and tasked with conducting the evidence reviews. The process included convening a public review of the guideline draft in July 2023.

### Preventing chronic kidney disease and maintaining kidney health: conclusions from a kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) controversies conference [^b7d5b21a]. Kidney International (2025). Medium credibility.

To date, the primary focus of chronic kidney disease (CKD) care has been on managing disease progression, complications, and kidney failure. In contrast, maintaining kidney health and preventing CKD have received limited attention, despite their potential to save millions of lives, reduce health care costs, and lessen environmental burdens. The cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic (CKM) concept frames CKD as part of a complex, high-risk syndrome requiring global risk assessment and multifactorial intervention. CKD incidence along with CKM risk factors may be reduced by a healthy diet, physical activity, and a supportive environment. However, risk for CKD does extend beyond the cardiovascular-metabolic component, and residual risk persists despite healthy lifestyles and treatment of risk factors. Post hoc analyses of clinical trials suggest pharmacological interventions, such as sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, may help to prevent or regress CKD in individuals with type 2 diabetes or obesity. Clinical trials are needed to validate these findings in broader high-risk populations. Personalized strategies to improve kidney health should include CKD risk prediction via targeted testing, genetic or biomarker assessments, shared decision-making, cost considerations, selection of therapeutics, and the potential for adverse effects. The overall goals of CKD prevention should prioritize a lifespan approach to risk evaluation along with safe, efficacious, and accessible interventions to maintain kidney health.

### Chronic kidney disease: why is current management uncoordinated and suboptimal? [^3b5ddd4d]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2001). Low credibility.

Morbidity and mortality associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is higher than that of the normal population, and the incidence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) continues to increase. Several factors contribute to the uncoordinated and suboptimal management of CKD, including the attitude and behaviour of nephrologists, referring physicians and patients, and economic constraints on healthcare systems. Late referral of at-risk patients to specialist care is an area of particular concern, as this denies nephrologists adequate opportunity to prevent progression of CKD and associated complications such as anaemia. Due to the ageing population and advances in technology, the costs of treating CKD and ESRD continue to escalate and represent another barrier to the delivery of optimal care. Optimizing the care provided to CKD patients requires a coordinated approach to the management of the condition. Closer collaboration and improved communication across specialities is important for the timely referral of patients and for efficient utilization of available resources. A multidisciplinary approach may facilitate patient identification and improve the management of CKD.

### Optimizing care for patients with CKD [^77fbd723]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Care of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is complex and requires a standardized and multidisciplinary approach. A number of strategies have been suggested to improve care for patients with CKD, including the development of clinical practice guidelines and introduction of chronic disease management (CDM) programs. CDM programs represent a proactive approach to care by supporting the physician and patient, with an emphasis on prevention of exacerbations and complications achieved through a coordinated multidisciplinary team. In addition to targeting patients at highest risk, CDM programs also emphasize intensive monitoring and proactive follow-up. The expansion of professional roles may be an important component in ensuring the success of this approach. Although observational studies suggest that specific components of CDM programs may improve care for patients with CKD, further research is needed to evaluate the program component effectiveness in CKD prevention and management. This includes well-conducted randomized trials and long-term follow-up of patients with CKD to assess changes in adverse health outcomes.

### Kidney disease in the elderly: update on recent literature [^bf8a334c]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

We review recent literature on the epidemiology and outcomes of chronic kidney disease in the elderly and discuss implications for management.

Recent Findings

Chronic kidney disease is common in the elderly and associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. The prognostic significance of a given level of estimated glomerular filtration rate, however, varies substantially by age. Estimates of the prevalence of chronic kidney disease at the population level and estimates glomerular filtration rate at the individual level are exquisitely sensitive to the methods used to arrive at these estimates. At present there is no clear consensus on the optimal approach to estimating glomerular filtration rate in elderly individuals in the clinical setting. Available evidence to guide management of chronic kidney disease is based largely on trials in younger individuals. It is unclear to what extent the results of these trials can be extrapolated to older individuals with chronic kidney disease.

Summary

We advise caution in applying current guidelines to the care of the large number of individuals aged 70 years and older with chronic kidney disease. Ideally, the care of these patients should be individualized and carefully integrated with the management of other comorbid conditions and with patient preferences.

End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is a major health problem associated with considerable increase in morbidity and mortality and with decreased quality of life. To slow the progression of kidney failure, to prevent the consequences of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and to decrease cardiovascular mortality associated with CKD, it is crucial to detect patients with CKD early and to optimize their care. To assist physicians in patient management, members of a working party for the management of CKD have identified several recommendations for the screening of patients at risk of CKD and for the management of patients with established CKD.

Description

The KDIGO 2022 Clinical Practice Guideline for Diabetes Management in Chronic Kidney Disease is an update of the 2020 guideline from Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO).

Methods

The KDIGO Work Group updated the guideline, which included reviewing and grading new evidence that was identified and summarized. As in the previous guideline, the Work Group used the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach to appraise evidence and rate the strength of recommendations and expert judgment to develop consensus practice points. New evidence led to updating of recommendations in the chapters Comprehensive Care in Patients With Diabetes and CKD (Chapter 1) and Glucose-Lowering Therapies in Patients With T2D and CKD (Chapter 4). New evidence did not change recommendations in the chapters Glycemic Monitoring and Targets in Patients With Diabetes and CKD (Chapter 2), Lifestyle Interventions in Patients With Diabetes and CKD (Chapter 3), and Approaches to Management of Patients With Diabetes and CKD (Chapter 5).

Recommendations

The updated guideline includes 13 recommendations and 52 practice points for clinicians caring for patients with diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD). A focus on preserving kidney function and maintaining well-being is recommended using a layered approach to care, starting with a foundation of lifestyle interventions, self-management, and first-line pharmacotherapy (such as sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors) demonstrated to improve clinical outcomes. To this are added additional drugs with heart and kidney protection, such as glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, and interventions to control risk factors for CKD progression and cardiovascular events, such as blood pressure, glycemia, and lipids.

KDIGO 2024 chronic kidney disease (CKD) guideline — rating of recommendations states that the strength of recommendations is "indicated as Level 1 or Level 2, and the certainty of the supporting evidence is shown as A, B, C, or D". Level 1 ("We recommend") implies for patients that "Most people in your situation would want the recommended course of action, and only a small proportion would not", for clinicians that "Most patients should receive the recommended course of action", and for policy that "The recommendation can be evaluated as a candidate for developing a policy or a performance measure". Level 2 ("We suggest") implies for patients that "The majority of people in your situation would want the recommended course of action, but many would not", for clinicians that "Different choices will be appropriate for different patients. Each patient needs help to arrive at a management decision consistent with their values and preferences", and for policy that "The recommendation is likely to require substantial debate and involvement of stakeholders before policy can be determined". Certainty of evidence categories are defined as A "High" with "We are confident that the true effect is close to the estimate of the effect", B "Moderate" with "The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different", C "Low" with "The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect", and D "Very low" with "The estimate of effect is very uncertain, and often, it will be far from the true effect".

### Electronic health record population health management for chronic kidney disease care: a cluster randomized clinical trial [^18cca531]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Does a multidisciplinary team-based approach across a large health system using electronic health records and population health management strategy reduce progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and improve evidence-based care among patients with high-risk kidney disease?

Findings

In this cluster randomized clinical trial that included 1596 patients with chronic kidney disease with high risk of progression to kidney failure who were not seeing a nephrologist, a multifaceted intervention vs usual care control did not reduce risk of CKD progression, but rather increased exposure to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin 2 receptor blockers over a median follow-up of 17 months.

Meaning

The results of this randomized clinical trial indicate that an electronic health records and population health management strategy using a multifaceted intervention addressed many of the implementation barriers to evidence-based care delivery but did not reduce CKD progression.

### Detecting and managing the patient with chronic kidney disease in primary care: a review of the latest guidelines [^d865ac4f]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major global health problem, affecting about 9.5% of the population and 850million people worldwide. In primary care, most CKD is caused by diabetes and/or hypertension, but a substantial proportion of cases may have alternative causes. During the early stages, CKD is asymptomatic, and many people are unaware that they are living with the disease. Despite the lack of symptoms, CKD is associated with elevated risks of cardiovascular disease, progressive kidney disease, kidney failure and premature mortality. Risk reduction strategies are effective and cost-effective but require early diagnosis through testing of the estimated glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria in high-risk populations. Once diagnosed, the treatment of CKD centres around lifestyle interventions, blood pressure and glycaemic control, and preventative treatments for cardiovascular disease and kidney disease progression. Most patients with CKD should be managed with statins, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors. Additional treatment options to reduce cardiorenal risk are available in patients with diabetes, including glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. The Kidney Failure Risk Equation is a new tool that can support the identification of patients at high risk of progressive kidney disease and kidney failure and can be used to guide referrals to nephrology. This review summarizes the latest guidance relevant to managing adults with, or at risk of, CKD and provides practical advice for managing patients with CKD in primary care.

### Preventing chronic kidney disease and maintaining kidney health: conclusions from a kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) controversies conference [^489d751b]. Kidney International (2025). Medium credibility.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

Given the growing global threats to kidney health and the known benefits of kidney protective strategies and therapies, the current era holds an opportunity to broaden focus from managing existing CKD to maintaining kidney health. Based on a large body of evidence, the consensus of meeting participants centered on a lifespan approach that takes into consideration physical, mental, and social determinants of health. Beyond healthy lifestyle and treatment of risk factors, therapeutics such as SGLT2i and GLP-1RA may prevent or regress CKD. To achieve goals for optimal, cost-effective means for implementing CKD prevention, the nephrology and primary care communities must ambitiously advocate for system-level change focused on kidney risk profiling and appropriate testing (including both eGFR and UACR). Future kidney guidelines may consider recommendations for screening to identify individuals at high risk of CKD, similar to the approach used in diabetes (Table 5). Additionally, measures of overall well-being can expand relevant kidney health outcomes. Societal perspectives should be considered in messaging the imperatives for CKD prevention to broad public health audiences. Endorsements from authoritative bodies such as the World Health Organization add legitimacy to health-related messages. Application of logic models can be used to enhance understanding of interdependent systems for implementation efforts. Collaborations among primary care and specialist health care professionals, health systems, payers, and policymakers are needed to align goals.

### Barriers and enablers to detection and management of chronic kidney disease in primary healthcare: a systematic review [^b0989242]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is growing population health concern worldwide. The results of the Global Burden of Disease Study suggested that in 2015, 1.2 million deaths were associated with kidney failure, an increase of 32% since 2005. Higher income countries typically spend 2–3% of their annual health budget on the treatment of end-stage kidney disease, however the percentage of the population which receives such treatment is less than 0.03% of the population. Even a moderate decline in kidney function is associated with significantly higher risk of cardiovascular events and mortality, while those who progress to end-stage kidney disease require specialist treatment, either transplantation, dialysis or palliation, all adding significant cost to the health budget.

With early identification and effective management, CKD progression to end-stage kidney disease can be slowed or prevented. Most patients with risk factors for, or early stages of CKD are treated in primary care. Therefore, exploration of how best to support primary care providers (PC-P) to detect and manage CKD is needed. While several studies have explored factors impacting the management of CKD in the primary care setting, there is a need to identify common barriers and enablers in order to develop effective strategies to enhance CKD care. While a systematic review of barriers to CKD management in primary care has been published, this study did not explore enabling factors. In addition, as the search for the previous review was conducted almost 10 years ago, there is a need to explore the more recent evidence on this topic. Therefore, the present systematic review aimed to provide an expanded and more recent perspective on the topic of barriers and enablers to the diagnosis and management of CKD in primary care.

Description

The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) organization updated its existing clinical practice guideline in 2024 to provide guidance on the evaluation, management, and treatment of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in adults and children who are not receiving kidney replacement therapy.

Methods

The KDIGO CKD Guideline Work Group defined the scope of the guideline and determined topics for systematic review. An independent Evidence Review Team systematically reviewed the evidence and graded the certainty of evidence for each of the review topics. Latest searches of the English-language literature were done in July 2023. Final modification of the guideline was informed by a public review process during summer of 2023 involving registered stakeholders.

Recommendations

The full guideline included 28 recommendations and 141 practice points. This synopsis focuses on the recommendations that have the greatest evidence. Practice points reflect the expert opinion of the group where evidence is not that strong. Recommendations include greater emphasis on cystatin C for assessment of glomerular filtration rate, point-of-care testing in remote areas, a shift to an individualized risk-based approach to predict kidney failure, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors for some patients with CKD with and without diabetes, and statin use for adults older than 50 years and CKD. Together the recommendations and practice points provide guidance for how to evaluate and manage persons with CKD.

People with diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at high risk for kidney failure, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and premature mortality. Recent clinical trials support new approaches to treat diabetes and CKD. The 2022 American Diabetes Association (ADA) Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes and the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) 2022 Clinical Practice Guideline for Diabetes Management in Chronic Kidney Disease each provide evidence-based recommendations for management. A joint group of ADA and KDIGO representatives reviewed and developed a series of consensus statements to guide clinical care from the ADA and KDIGO guidelines. The published guidelines are aligned in the areas of CKD screening and diagnosis, glycemia monitoring, lifestyle therapies, treatment goals, and pharmacologic management. Recommendations include comprehensive care in which pharmacotherapy that is proven to improve kidney and cardiovascular outcomes is layered on a foundation of healthy lifestyle. Consensus statements provide specific guidance on use of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, metformin, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists, and a nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist. These areas of consensus provide clear direction for implementation of care to improve clinical outcomes of people with diabetes and CKD.

The increasing global prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease with the associated spiraling cost has profound public health and economic implications. This has made slowing the progression of CKD, a major health-care priority. CKD is invariably characterized by progressive kidney fibrosis and at present, treatment aiming to slow the progression of CKD is limited to aggressive blood pressure control, with few therapies targeting the fibrotic process itself. In this review, we explore the potential of experimental therapeutic strategies, based on preventing or reversing the pathophysiologic steps of kidney remodeling that lead to fibrosis.

Discussion

Although RRT has been available for decades in wealthy countries, most people with kidney failure have insufficient access to life-saving dialysis and kidney transplants. CKD care is an effective alternative, yet it has limitations: underutilization of health professionals in the care of patients with CKD, limited capacity for CKD surveillance, a general absence of national strategies to support CKD care, and poor integration of CKD care programs into national NCD control schemes. A global change in the approach to CKD, from treatment to prevention, is imperative, especially in low- and middle-income countries that lack resources for RRT 2.

### Chronic kidney disease: global dimension and perspectives [^2570016d]. Lancet (2013). Excellent credibility.

Chronic kidney disease is defined as a reduced glomerular filtration rate, increased urinary albumin excretion, or both, and is an increasing public health issue. Prevalence is estimated to be 8–16% worldwide. Complications include increased all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, kidney-disease progression, acute kidney injury, cognitive decline, anaemia, mineral and bone disorders, and fractures. Worldwide, diabetes mellitus is the most common cause of chronic kidney disease, but in some regions other causes, such as herbal and environmental toxins, are more common. The poorest populations are at the highest risk. Screening and intervention can prevent chronic kidney disease, and where management strategies have been implemented the incidence of end-stage kidney disease has been reduced. Awareness of the disorder, however, remains low in many communities and among many physicians. Strategies to reduce burden and costs related to chronic kidney disease need to be included in national programmes for non-communicable diseases.

The Kidney Disease

Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Clinical Practice Guideline for Diabetes Management in Chronic Kidney Disease represents the first KDIGO guideline on this subject. The guideline comes at a time when advances in diabetes technology and therapeutics offer new options to manage the large population of patients with diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD) at high risk of poor health outcomes. An enlarging base of high-quality evidence from randomized clinical trials is available to evaluate important new treatments offering organ protection, such as sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists. The goal of the new guideline is to provide evidence-based recommendations to optimize the clinical care of people with diabetes and CKD by integrating new options with existing management strategies. In addition, the guideline contains practice points to facilitate implementation when insufficient data are available to make well-justified recommendations or when additional guidance may be useful for clinical application. The guideline covers comprehensive care of patients with diabetes and CKD, glycemic monitoring and targets, lifestyle interventions, antihyperglycemic therapies, and self-management and health systems approaches to management of patients with diabetes and CKD.

KDIGO 2024 chronic kidney disease (CKD) chronicity assessment — differentiating CKD from acute kidney disorders emphasizes that the major challenge for defining chronicity is to differentiate CKD from acute kidney diseases (AKDs) such as acute glomerulonephritis (GN), including acute kidney injury (AKI), which may require different timelines for initiation of treatments, different interventions, and have different etiologies and outcomes. The duration of kidney disease may be documented or inferred based on the clinical context; for example, a person with decreased GFR or kidney damage during an acute illness, without prior documentation of kidney disease, may be inferred to have AKD, and resolution over days to weeks would confirm the diagnosis of AKI. A person with similar findings in the absence of an acute illness may be inferred to have CKD and, if followed over time, would be confirmed to have CKD. In both cases, repeat ascertainment of GFR and kidney damage is recommended for accurate diagnosis and staging, and the timing of the evaluation depends on clinical judgment, with earlier evaluation for those suspected of having AKI and later evaluation for those suspected of having CKD. For people with risk factors for CKD, delaying diagnosis for the sake of confirming chronicity can delay care, and initiating treatment both allows for earlier intervention and also indicates to people the importance of the disease.

Topic areas for which recommendations are updated based on new evidence include Chapter 1: Comprehensive care in patients with diabetes and CKD and Chapter 4: Glucose-lowering therapies in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and CKD. The content of previous chapters on Glycemic monitoring and targets in patients with diabetes and CKD (Chapter 2), Lifestyle interventions in patients with diabetes and CKD (Chapter 3), and Approaches to management of patients with diabetes and CKD (Chapter 5) has been deemed current and was not changed. This guideline update was developed according to an explicit process of evidence review and appraisal. Treatment approaches and guideline recommendations are based on systematic reviews of relevant studies and appraisal of the quality of the evidence, and the strength of recommendations followed the "Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation" (GRADE) approach. Limitations of the evidence are discussed, and areas for which additional research is needed are presented.

### Early chronic kidney disease: diagnosis, management and models of care [^7c995033]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2015). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is prevalent in many countries, and the costs associated with the care of patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are estimated to exceed US$1 trillion globally. The clinical and economic rationale for the design of timely and appropriate health system responses to limit the progression of CKD to ESRD is clear. Clinical care might improve if early-stage CKD with risk of progression to ESRD is differentiated from early-stage CKD that is unlikely to advance. The diagnostic tests that are currently used for CKD exhibit key limitations; therefore, additional research is required to increase awareness of the risk factors for CKD progression. Systems modelling can be used to evaluate the impact of different care models on CKD outcomes and costs. The US Indian Health Service has demonstrated that an integrated, system-wide approach can produce notable benefits on cardiovascular and renal health outcomes. Economic and clinical improvements might, therefore, be possible if CKD is reconceptualized as a part of primary care. This Review discusses which early CKD interventions are appropriate, the optimum time to provide clinical care, and the most suitable model of care to adopt.

What?

Confirmation and staging

The diagnosis of CKD requires demonstration of reduced GFR or evidence of kidney damage for 3 or more months. Investigation for chronicity includes trending prior laboratory results for confirmation of stability. In the absence of previous eGFR results, observation of small echogenic kidneys on imaging, or imaging manifestations of secondary hyperparathyroidism confirm chronicity. If duration of kidney disease is unable to be confirmed, AKI should be ruled out. Once identified, CKD should be staged based on the cause-GFR-albuminuria (C-G-A) classification. Optimal care of patients with CKD includes a multifaceted approach with optimization of diet, lifestyle, comorbidities, and pharmacotherapy.

### Optimizing renal anaemia management – benefits of early referral and treatment [^d5fca871]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2005). Low credibility.

Despite clinical practice guidelines for the management of anaemia of chronic kidney disease and a growing literature concerning the treatment of renal anaemia in diverse patient groups, there remain uncertainties over definitions and descriptions for optimal management of renal anaemia. The patients most likely to derive the greatest long-term benefit from correction of anaemia are those with chronic kidney disease who are pre-dialysis. Early intervention to correct anaemia has the potential to impact on the progression of chronic kidney disease and affect patient morbidity, hospitalization rates, quality of life and mortality. This review considers current guidance on anaemia management, the evidence behind the guidance and the data shortfalls in an attempt to provide a topical overview of current understanding and future directions for optimal management of renal anaemia, particularly in high-risk groups.

### Applying multiple interventions in chronic kidney disease [^79e298ac]. Seminars in Dialysis (2003). Low credibility.

The medical, social, and financial burdens posed by end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are many and growing rapidly. People generally reach ESRD as a result of chronic progressive kidney disease. Advancing kidney disease is associated with several treatable complications, which if poorly managed reduce the length and quality of life. In addition, there are strong links between chronic kidney disease (CKD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Many people with less advanced CKD will die or suffer complications of CVD before reaching ESRD. Efficacious interventions, such as lowering blood pressure and treating dyslipidemia, can substantially reduce the progression of both kidney and cardiovascular disease. Careful management of these complex and interrelated diseases and risk factors requires detailed longitudinal and focused care which does not seem to be optimally delivered by health service practitioners organized in traditional ways. A disease management approach offers promise in this setting, but requires further study of clinical and economic impact.

INTRODUCTION

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major global health priority affecting 10%–12% of the population (over 850 million people) with the number of affected individuals projected to increase rapidly over the next few decades. The prevalence of CKD is higher in those over 60 years of age, as well as in individuals with increased body mass index, diabetes and hypertension. Having CKD has significant negative implications for both life expectancy and quality of life, especially as a core component of the increasingly recognized cardio-kidney-metabolic multimorbidity syndrome. The 2024 Report from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study using 2021 data shows that CKD is the 11th leading cause of death, with 1.53 million deaths, with a further 2.1 million cardiovascular deaths attributable to CKD. CKD is also expected to rise from the 23rd leading cause of disease burden worldwide in 2022 to the 10th by 2050. However, much of the kidney disease burden globally, and its impact on outcomes of other conditions, remains uncounted, therefore these numbers are likely conservative estimates.

The new 2024 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Clinical Practice Guideline for the Evaluation and Management of CKD, 12 years on from the previous guideline in 2012, are a very welcome update which emphasize both the advancements in the fields and the remaining gaps to fill. The document is an impressive text at 198 pages with 937 references, with multiple associated documents including supplementary material, executive summary and takeaway message summaries.

The purpose of this article is not to summarize the KDIGO 2024 CKD Guideline but, on behalf of the European Renal Best Practice (ERBP) group of the European Renal Association (ERA), to highlight some of what is new and relevant, especially in the European context. Given the rapidly evolving and expanding field of treatment for CKD [for example, the FLOW trial data on Semaglutide, a Glucagon Like Peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1ra), on kidney disease progression which was published after the KDIGO 2024 CKD Guideline], we chose to focus on the remaining Achilles' heel of the global push to improve CKD care and outcomes — the first step towards effective management of the disease — evaluation and risk assessment in people with CKD.

### Updates to management of adults with chronic kidney disease… [^cce69d8b]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

In March 2024, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes published updated guidelines on the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease. 1 A comprehensive review of screening for and evaluation and management of CKD and its complications was published previously in American Family Physician. 2 This editorial highlights the KDIGO updates related to new medications that can delay CKD progression and recommendations for assessment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk in patients with CKD. LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION Increasing physical activity Weight management Cessation of tobacco use Consumption of a whole-food, plant-based diet that minimizes intake of animal-based and ultra-processed foods When available, referral to a renal dietitian is beneficial for patients with CKD because of their complex dietary needs. These include adjustment in intake of sodium, potassium, phosphorus, protein, and fluids, while also accounting for comorbidities.

RENIN-ANGIOTENSIN SYSTEM INHIBITORS Renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, which include angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, have a well-established history of reducing all-cause mortality and providing renal and cardioprotective benefits in adults who have CKD with or without diabetes. For patients with nonemergent hyperkalemia, the KDIGO guideline has shifted away from recommending reflexive discontinuation of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors. Instead, management suggestions include reviewing modifiable factors such as dietary potassium intake, eliminating medications that increase serum potassium, and prescribing potassium-lowering medications such as diuretics when appropriate. The National Kidney Foundation provides a patient-friendly overview of high- and low-potassium foods in English and Spanish. Referral to a nephrologist may also be appropriate.

Clinicians can initiate newer potassium-binding agents such as patiromer or sodium zirconium cyclosilicate. These are well-tolerated and safe for long-term use compared with earlier agents. NONSTEROIDAL MINERALOCORTICOID RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS Finerenone is the only nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist available in the United States. It slows CKD progression and reduces cardiovascular risk, specifically hospitalizations for heart failure, in adults with CKD and type 2 diabetes.

### A synopsis of the evidence for the science and clinical management of cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic (CKM) syndrome: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^1e519842]. Circulation (2023). Medium credibility.

A growing appreciation of the pathophysiological interrelatedness of metabolic risk factors such as obesity and diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and cardiovascular disease has led to the conceptualization of cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic syndrome. The confluence of metabolic risk factors and chronic kidney disease within cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic syndrome is strongly linked to risk for adverse cardiovascular and kidney outcomes. In addition, there are unique management considerations for individuals with established cardiovascular disease and coexisting metabolic risk factors, chronic kidney disease, or both. An extensive body of literature supports our scientific understanding of, and approach to, prevention and management for individuals with cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic syndrome. However, there are critical gaps in knowledge related to cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic syndrome in terms of mechanisms of disease development, heterogeneity within clinical phenotypes, interplay between social determinants of health and biological risk factors, and accurate assessments of disease incidence in the context of competing risks. There are also key limitations in the data supporting the clinical care for cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic syndrome, particularly in terms of early-life prevention, screening for risk factors, interdisciplinary care models, optimal strategies for supporting lifestyle modification and weight loss, targeting of emerging cardioprotective and kidney-protective therapies, management of patients with both cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease, and the impact of systematically assessing and addressing social determinants of health. This scientific statement uses a crosswalk of major guidelines, in addition to a review of the scientific literature, to summarize the evidence and fundamental gaps related to the science, screening, prevention, and management of cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic syndrome.

Chronic kidney disease is an ongoing deterioration of renal function that often progresses to end-stage renal disease. Management goals in children include slowing disease progression, prevention and treatment of complications, and optimizing growth, development, and quality of life. Nutritional management is critically important to achieve these goals. Control of blood pressure, proteinuria, and metabolic acidosis with dietary and pharmacologic measures may slow progression of chronic kidney disease. Although significant progress in management has been made, further research is required to resolve many outstanding controversies. We review recent developments in pediatric chronic kidney disease, focusing on dietary measures to improve outcomes.

### The role of exercise training in the management of chronic kidney disease [^34e5052d]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

In this review, we summarize recent studies of exercise interventions in chronic kidney disease (CKD), potential benefits, discuss barriers to implementation and make practical recommendations for incorporating exercise training into the care of patients with CKD.

Recent Findings

Interventions targeting increased fitness and physical activity are effective and may have multiple potential benefits. Recommendations regarding physical activity advice have been incorporated into the recent update of the KDIGO CKD guidelines, which suggest that patients perform 30 min of moderate intensity exercise on most days of the week. Exercise as simple, popular and inexpensive as walking appears to be associated with significant health benefits. More vigorous exercise requires increased supervision but can be safely prescribed to patients with a broad range of comorbidities and may be associated with greater gains in health.

Summary

Physical activity, cardiorespiratory fitness and muscle function are low in patients with CKD. A sedentary lifestyle has been associated with increased mortality, morbidity and the risk factors that drive progression of both kidney and cardiac disease. There is much to learn about the benefits of different modalities of exercise but the time has come to routinely prescribe exercise interventions as part of standard nephrological care.

### Self-management interventions for chronic kidney disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^937b18d0]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

We observed that self-management intervention provided additional benefits for neither renal outcomes nor all-cause mortality, when compared with standard treatments during a follow-up of 13.44 months in patients with CKD non-dialysis. However, it does show benefits for urine protein decline, blood pressure level, exercise capacity and CRP level. Hence, self-management intervention was beneficial for changing modifiable risk factors (e.g. proteinuria, blood pressure level, blood glucose level, exercise capacity) for the progression of kidney disease. It may have been beneficial in optimizing CKD patient outcomes and avoiding progression to ESRD, and thus may have improved survival.

Integration and ensuring the sustainability of healthcare self-management plans requires a large sample of RCT research and a unified and precise self-management intervention framework. These resources will help determine the ideal implementation for interventions.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^6c9dd275]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) grading determinants — The strength of a recommendation was graded as Level 1 or Level 2 and was determined by the balance of benefits and harms, the overall certainty of the evidence, patient values and preferences, resource use and costs, and other considerations; the overall certainty of the evidence was graded high (A), moderate (B), low (C), or very low (D). Healthcare and non–healthcare resources in the treatment management pathway were considered when grading, and no formal economic evaluations, including cost-effectiveness analysis, were conducted. Practice points represent the expert judgment of the guideline Work Group and may be based on limited evidence; each guideline recommendation provides an assessment of the strength (Level 1, "we recommend" or Level 2, "we suggest") and the overall certainty (A, B, C, D). Table 48 clarifies that larger differences between desirable and undesirable effects make a strong recommendation more likely, higher certainty makes a strong recommendation more likely, more variability or uncertainty in values and preferences makes a weak recommendation more likely, and higher costs make a strong recommendation less likely.

Treatment Strategies for CKD in People With T2D

Multiple treatment strategies have been shown to reduce the development and progression of CKD in people living with T2D. The most common goal of intervention is to slow progression of CKD, but sometimes with early intervention in mild CKD, UACR and eGFR may revert to normal levels.

Lifestyle

A healthy diet with appropriate nutrition, adequate physical activity, smoking cessation, and body weight management can reduce both kidney and cardiovascular disease outcomes, especially when combined with appropriate drug therapies. The KDIGO guideline recommends that people with CKD should undertake moderate physical activity for a cumulative duration of at least 150 min per week or as tolerated and consume more plant-based foods versus animal-based foods, maintaining a protein intake of 0.8 g/kg body weight per day for adults with CKD stages G3 to G5. The KDIGO guideline also recommends a sodium intake of < 2 g per day (or < 90 mmol of sodium per day or < 5 g of sodium chloride per day) for people with CKD.

### Effects of dietary interventions on incidence and progression of CKD [^dc0af5ee]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2014). Medium credibility.

Traditional strategies for management of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have not resulted in any change in the growing prevalence of CKD worldwide. A historic belief that eating healthily might ameliorate kidney disease still holds credibility in the 21(st) century. Dietary sodium restriction to < 2.3 g daily, a diet rich in fruits and vegetables and increased water consumption corresponding to a urine output of 3–4 l daily might slow the progression of early CKD, polycystic kidney disease or recurrent kidney stones. Current evidence suggests that a reduction in dietary net acid load could be beneficial in patients with CKD, but the supremacy of any particular diet has yet to be established. More trials of dietary interventions are needed, especially in diabetic nephropathy, before evidence-based recommendations can be made. In the meantime, nephrologists should discuss healthy dietary habits with their patients and provide individualized care aimed at maximizing the potential benefits of dietary intervention, reducing the incidence of CKD and delaying its progression to end-stage renal disease. Keeping in mind the lack of data on hard outcomes, dietary recommendations should take into account barriers to adherence and be tailored to different cultures, ethnicities and geographical locations.

### KDOQI clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^ff386280]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

Lifestyle and behavioral management in diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD) emphasizes concrete weight and activity guidance and the scope of available recommendations. The Work Group recommends that weight loss be achieved by a balanced reduction in caloric intake, rather than by diets that derive excess calories (> 20%) from animal protein (Guideline 2). Regular physical exercise also is encouraged to assist in achieving and maintaining a normal weight. Strategies for behavioral change and self-management of risk factors are addressed in CPR 4, and because of the paucity of data in the diabetes and CKD population, these recommendations were extrapolated from data in other groups and thus are included in the CPR section. A proposed approach to a diabetes and CKD self-management program is provided in CPR 4, Table 56. Optimal management of risk factors, including hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia, is emphasized in these guidelines, and in the view of the Work Group, addressing lifestyle through behavioral change is critically important for success in reducing the devastating impact of diabetes and CKD.
