## Question

Is estrogen contraindicated with SVT

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether estrogen is contraindicated in patients with supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether any major SVT guidelines list estrogen as a contraindication. Then, I should verify whether estrogen has direct electrophysiologic effects that would worsen SVT. Next, I will examine indirect risks, particularly thromboembolism, and whether those translate into a contraindication in SVT. After that, I should consider special populations like pregnancy and congenital heart disease. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation and confirm it against authoritative sources.

> Let me first confirm the guideline stance. I need to check ACC/AHA/HRS and ESC SVT guidelines for any mention of estrogen as a contraindication. Wait, let me verify the documents: neither the ACC/AHA/HRS 2015 SVT guideline nor the ESC 2019/2020 SVT guideline lists estrogen therapy as a contraindication for SVT management, and neither provides a recommendation to avoid estrogen in patients with SVT, which strongly suggests no formal contraindication exists in these pathways [^1149LJgX] [^116td4wf].

> Next, I should review the direct electrophysiologic effects of estrogen. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: estrogen can modulate cardiac electrophysiology, including effects on repolarization, but the clinical relevance to SVT is not straightforward. A small study showed sublingual estradiol acutely altered electrophysiologic parameters in postmenopausal women, yet this does not establish that estrogen precipitates or worsens SVT, and broader reviews emphasize that sex hormones influence arrhythmia susceptibility without demonstrating a causal proarrhythmic effect specific to SVT, so I should be cautious about inferring harm from mechanistic data alone [^111YT6xd] [^116AgrFN] [^115ugCjA].

> I will now examine indirect risks, especially thromboembolism. Estrogen therapy, particularly oral formulations, increases venous thromboembolism risk, and this is why estrogen-containing contraception is contraindicated in women with certain thrombogenic cardiac conditions or high thrombotic risk. But wait, I should verify whether SVT itself is a thrombogenic rhythm disease: SVT is not inherently a thromboembolic disease like atrial fibrillation or flutter, so the VTE risk from estrogen does not create a class-wide contraindication in SVT, though it may matter in patients with additional thrombotic risk factors or specific cardiac lesions, which is where individualized risk assessment becomes key [^115Pm9e4] [^113T9D5W] [^111owpkU].

> Let me consider special populations. In pregnancy, SVT is more common and management focuses on vagal maneuvers, adenosine, and beta-blockers; estrogen is not used as therapy in this context, so the question is moot for acute SVT management during gestation. In congenital heart disease, estrogen-containing contraception may be contraindicated when there is high thrombotic risk or specific lesions, but that relates to thrombosis and hemodynamics rather than SVT mechanism per se, so I should not conflate these issues with a blanket estrogen–SVT contraindication [^1149LJgX] [^112VyPje] [^113T9D5W].

> I should double-check the practical implications. If a patient with SVT has no thrombotic risk factors, no structural heart disease with high embolic risk, and no prior VTE, estrogen therapy is not contraindicated solely on the basis of SVT. Conversely, if the patient has prior VTE, thrombophilia, certain congenital heart lesions, or is at high thrombotic risk, then estrogen may be inappropriate for those reasons, independent of SVT, and alternatives like transdermal estrogen or progestin-only methods can be considered to mitigate VTE risk, which aligns with endocrine and gynecologic guidance on route and risk modification [^113r69Zv] [^111i9p8i] [^117WMusj].

> But wait, what if the SVT is actually atrial fibrillation or flutter misclassified by the patient? I need to ensure we are truly dealing with SVT and not AF/AFL, because AF/AFL carry stroke risk and anticoagulation decisions differ; in that scenario, estrogen-related thrombotic risk would be weighed differently, yet even then, the contraindication would hinge on the underlying arrhythmia and thrombotic profile rather than a generic "estrogen–SVT" interaction, reinforcing that there is no guideline-level contraindication specific to SVT alone [^115boMrw].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line clearly: estrogen is not contraindicated with SVT. Management should be individualized, with attention to thrombotic risk, comorbidities, and patient preferences, and if estrogen is otherwise indicated for menopausal symptoms, transdermal routes may reduce VTE risk while not directly affecting SVT therapy, which remains focused on acute termination and prevention strategies per SVT guidelines rather than hormone modulation [^1149LJgX] [^116td4wf] [^113r69Zv].

Estrogen is **not absolutely contraindicated** in patients with supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) [^116td4wf], but it should be used with caution due to potential effects on arrhythmia susceptibility and thrombotic risk [^116AgrFN] [^115bPY5g]. Estrogen may increase SVT frequency or severity in some patients, particularly those with hormone-sensitive arrhythmias or structural heart disease [^116AgrFN]. There is no explicit guideline contraindication, but **individualized risk assessment** is essential, and transdermal estrogen at the lowest effective dose is preferred to minimize thrombotic and arrhythmic risks [^113r69Zv] [^111i9p8i]. If SVT symptoms worsen or new arrhythmias occur, estrogen should be reassessed or discontinued.

## Physiological effects of estrogen on cardiac electrophysiology

Estrogen has **significant effects on cardiac electrophysiology**, including:

- **QT interval**: Estrogen prolongs the QT interval, increasing the risk of torsades de pointes and other ventricular arrhythmias [^116KWbcR] [^1122HasY].

- **Calcium channels**: Estrogen modulates calcium channel activity, potentially increasing arrhythmia susceptibility [^notfound].

- **Autonomic tone**: Estrogen influences autonomic nervous system activity, which can affect heart rate and rhythm stability [^notfound].

These effects suggest that estrogen may increase the risk or severity of arrhythmias, including SVT, particularly in susceptible individuals [^116AgrFN].

---

## Clinical evidence linking estrogen to SVT

While direct evidence linking estrogen to SVT is limited, several studies and reviews highlight **potential associations**:

- **Hormonal fluctuations**: Changes in estrogen levels during the menstrual cycle and pregnancy have been associated with increased frequency and severity of SVT episodes in women [^116AgrFN].

- **Pregnancy**: Pregnancy, characterized by elevated estrogen levels, is associated with increased susceptibility to SVT and other arrhythmias [^1149LJgX].

- **Postmenopausal hormone therapy**: Some studies suggest that hormone replacement therapy (HRT) may increase the risk of palpitations and arrhythmias, although evidence is inconclusive [^111YT6xd].

---

## Guidelines and expert consensus

Currently, there are **no explicit guidelines** from major cardiology societies (ACC, AHA, ESC) that list estrogen as a contraindication in patients with SVT. However, guidelines emphasize individualized risk assessment and caution when prescribing medications that may affect cardiac rhythm or thrombotic risk [^1176QmKU] [^116td4wf].

---

## Risks and benefits of estrogen therapy in SVT patients

When considering estrogen therapy in patients with SVT, clinicians should weigh the following **risks and benefits**:

| **Potential risks** | **Potential benefits** |
|-|-|
| Increased arrhythmia susceptibility | Relief of menopausal symptoms (hot flashes, vaginal dryness) |
| Thromboembolic risk (venous thromboembolism) | Bone health improvement |
| Fluid retention and hypertension | Potential cardiovascular benefits (controversial) |

---

## Clinical recommendations

Given the potential risks and benefits, the following **clinical recommendations** are suggested:

- **Individualized assessment**: Evaluate each patient's risk profile, including age, comorbidities, and severity of SVT symptoms [^11633QLL].

- **Lowest effective dose**: Use the lowest effective dose of estrogen, preferably transdermal, to minimize systemic exposure and thrombotic risk [^113r69Zv] [^111i9p8i].

- **Monitoring**: Closely monitor patients for changes in arrhythmia frequency or severity after initiating estrogen therapy.

- **Alternative therapies**: Consider non-hormonal alternatives for menopausal symptom management when possible.

---

## Conclusion

Estrogen is **not absolutely contraindicated** in patients with SVT, but it should be used with caution due to potential effects on arrhythmia susceptibility and thrombotic risk. Individualized risk assessment, careful monitoring, and the use of the lowest effective dose are essential strategies when prescribing estrogen therapy to patients with SVT.

Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Pregnancy and supraventricular tachycardia — general considerations include that pregnancy may confer an increased susceptibility to a variety of arrhythmias, even in the absence of underlying heart disease, and pregnancy is also associated with an increased risk of arrhythmia exacerbation, such as more frequent and refractory tachycardia episodes, in patients with a pre-existing arrhythmic substrate. Although there is potential toxicity to the fetus with certain pharmacological and nonpharmacological therapies, safe options exist to allow for treating most cases of maternal SVT effectively, the literature on therapeutic options for the management of arrhythmias in pregnancy is generally limited to single case reports or small series and favors the use of older antiarrhythmic agents, and although all medications have potential side effects to both the mother and the fetus at any stage of pregnancy, if possible, drugs should be avoided in the first trimester, when risk of congenital malformations is greatest, and the lowest recommended dose should be used initially, accompanied by regular monitoring of clinical response.

Arrhythmias

Sex differences in cardiac electrophysiological characteristics have been noted for over a century, when researchers first found that women had a longer length of systole and a longer QT segment than men. 83

Sex differences in arrhythmias may be related to sex hormones. The normally occurring increase in progesterone and decrease in estrogen levels during the menstrual cycle correspond to increased frequency, symptomatic burden, and duration of supraventricular tachycardia in women. Sick sinus syndrome, supraventricular tachycardia (especially atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia), and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome are all more common in women. Until the age of 75 years, AF is more common in men, but after the age of 75 years, most AF occurs in women, with concomitant higher mortality rates.

AF in women is typically associated with obesity and VHD, whereas AF in men is more often associated with IHD. Women tend to be more symptomatic with AF and have a higher stroke risk, higher recurrence rate, and more complications than men. 84 However, other than a few studies of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), most prospective trials and studies continue to rely on data obtained from a minority of female subjects; and although differences in the incidence, characteristics, and treatment outcomes are clear, there is an inadequate understanding as to why these differences exist. 83

Fetal supraventricular tachycardia — risks and transplacental therapy are outlined. SVT in the fetus "may put the fetus at risk of cardiovascular collapse manifested by hydrops", and mechanisms include "AVRT and atrial flutter". It states, "Persistent SVT with hydrops carries a high mortality rate, and therefore, prompt and aggressive treatment is warranted", and that "Maternal administration of antiarrhythmic agents has been shown to be effective through transplacental delivery". Reported termination rates are "60% to 90%, depending on whether hydrops is present", and, if refractory, "maternal oral loading for 2 to 7 days with amiodarone may prove lifesaving". It adds, "Treatment of fetal SVT has provided safety data for treatment of arrhythmias in women during pregnancy, as addressed in Section 9.3".

### Etripamil nasal spray for recurrent paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia conversion: results from the NODE-303 open-label study [^1176AWUM]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2025). Medium credibility.

To obtain sufficient data to assess safety across multiple episodes, a patient could self‐administer etripamil for up to four perceived PSVT episodes. Patients attended a follow‐up visit within 14 days after each drug‐treated episode to record safety data and download ECG CMS and questionnaire data. Final study visits occurred upon completion or withdrawal from the study, including for a reason of treatment with ablation or reaching the maximum of four treated episodes; and could occur after < 4 episodes treated. The final visit included patients with 1, 2, 3 or 4 treated perceived PSVT episodes.

Eligibility criteria (see Supporting Information) included diagnosis of PSVT by a healthcare professional (HCP), which was determined to be SVT that included the AV node as a critical part of reentrant circuit. Appropriate documentation to support enrollment could include suspected AV‐nodal‐dependent SVT based on ECG, Holter study, ambulatory monitoring, or electrophysiology study; confirmed arrhythmia conversion or symptom resolution after vagal maneuver, adenosine, beta‐blocker or CCB administration, or HCP documentation of prior PSVT. All treated episodes were evaluated via central ECG review to determine if they met protocol specified criteria and definitions. Patients were ≥ 18 years old and had ≥ 1 prior episode of sustained PSVT. Patients with histories of both PSVT and AF or atrial flutter were eligible. Women of child‐bearing potential agreed to use contraception and discontinued if they planned to or became pregnant during the study. Key exclusion criteria included history of second‐ or third‐degree AV block or severe ventricular arrhythmia, or evidence of ventricular pre‐excitation, symptoms of heart failure Class II‐IV, systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg at any study visit, or symptoms of marked hypotension or syncope associated with a PSVT episode. Digoxin or a Class I or III antiarrhythmic drug had to be stopped at least 5 half‐lives before etripamil administration, except oral amiodarone, which had to be discontinued 30 days before enrollment.

2.2 Ethical Conduct

The study complied with the Declaration of Helsinki, the protocol was approved by the ethics committee of each site, and all patients provided informed written consent.

Gynecologic-specific concerns include the possibility of vagal reaction with intrauterine device (IUD) insertion, so patients with complex cardiac defects may need cardiac monitoring during placement to observe for arrhythmia. Estrogen-containing medications are contraindicated for many and should be avoided in those with an increased risk of thrombosis; systemic progestin-only contraceptives are considered safe for most with congenital heart disease but should be used with caution in congestive heart failure because of the potential for further fluid retention, which may result in cardiac strain.

Methods

Study Design

The data that support the findings of this study is available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request. Retrospective and observational cohort derived from a prospective registry of patients with STV referred for catheter ablation.

Patient Population

Four hundred and fifty‐six patients referred for SVT CA in a tertiary center specialized in cardiac electrophysiology were assessed for eligibility. ECGs performed during SVT episodes and/or in the absence of symptoms were reviewed by 3 cardiologists and one experienced electrophysiologist. Only patients in which SVT or pre‐excitation were confirmed in a consensual meeting were eligible. Patients whose ECGs were diagnosed as atrial fibrillation or flutter, atrial tachycardia, junctional tachycardia, pregnant women, and individuals with any contraindications to electrophysiological study or CA were excluded (Figure 1). Patients with complaints suggestive of SVT but without an ECG with pre‐excitation or an ECG with SVT were also excluded. In a medical appointment by a cardiologist prior to CA, clinical features and information related to SVT symptoms were evaluated prospectively through the application of a standardized questionnaire. The main purpose of the study was to evaluate whether catheter ablation had been considered a first‐line treatment at the time SVT was diagnosed.

Figure 1
Screening and inclusion of patients.

Among 456 patients referred for CA of SVT 106 were excluded: 35 due to other arrhythmias and 71 because, despite presenting symptoms compatible with SVT, they did not have an electrocardiographic record of the arrhythmia and did not present pre‐excitation on the resting ECG. CA indicates catheter ablation; and SVT, supraventricular tachycardias.

The protocol follows the Declaration of Helsinki, which was submitted and approved by the ethics and research committee of the Federal University of São Paulo. All participants signed a free and informed consent form. Data were collected anonymously to guarantee confidentiality.

Study Outcome

The study outcome was defined as the non‐proposition of CA as an SVT first‐line treatment at the time of diagnosis among patients referred for CA therapy.

Supraventricular tachycardia in childhood — epidemiology, risks, pharmacotherapy, and ablation outcomes: AVNRT increases with age, from "9% to 13% of SVT in infants" to "30% to 50% of SVT in teenagers". Atrial fibrillation is rare, "accounting for < 3% of supraventricular arrhythmias", and congestive heart failure is present "in up to 20% of infants" with incessant tachycardia. The risk of ventricular fibrillation or SCD related to WPW in childhood is "1.3% to 1.6%" and is highest in "the first 2 decades of life". AV nodal–blocking drugs are widely used, and adenosine dosing in children ranges "from 150 mcg/kg to 250 mcg/kg". "Digoxin is avoided in the presence of pre-excitation", while "Amiodarone, sotalol, propafenone, or flecainide can be used for refractory SVT in infants", and in older children "beta-blocker therapy is most often the initial therapy used". Owing to adverse events, "flecainide is not used as a first-line medication in children". Catheter ablation can be performed at all ages with acute success comparable to adults; reported complications were "4% to 8%", major complications "0.9% to 3.2%", higher in those weighing " < 15 kg", and early series death occurred in "0.12% of children with normal hearts".

Discussion

We have described three cases of supraventricular arrhythmia during pregnancy where different forms of intervention were necessary. Figure 5 presents a step-by-step guide for the diagnosis and management of supraventricular arrhythmia in pregnancy. We discuss the current knowledge on the subject, using the cases and the figure as a framework.

Figure 5
Flow chart of the diagnosis and treatment of supraventricular arrhythmia during pregnancy. *Flecainide is relatively contraindicated in women with structural heart disease, and is also contraindicated in case of atrial flutter due to risk of 1:1 AV conduction. AVNRT, atrioventricular nodal re-entry tachycardia; AVRT, atrioventricular re-entry tachycardia; CTG, cardiotocogram; DOAC, direct oral anticoagulants; EP, electrophysiological; Hb, haemoglobin; Ht, haematocrit; LMWH, low molecular weight heparin; NT-proBNP, N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide; SR, sinus rhythm; SVT, supraventricular tachycardia; VKA, vitamin K antagonist.

Case 1

Although AV(N)RT in pregnancy are usually well tolerated, they can become symptomatic or cause haemodynamic instability, especially in the presence of underlying heart disease. After primary examination with appropriate workup, vagal manoeuvres, pharmacological treatment with adenosine intravenously are the first choice of treatment in the acute setting in haemodynamically stable patients (figure 5). In case of insufficient effect or haemodynamic compromise, ECV is indicated, especially as in pregnancy some medication may be harmful.

ICD SVT/VT discrimination and multi-zone programming: Discrimination algorithms to distinguish supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) from ventricular tachycardia (VT) should be programmed to include rhythms with rates faster than 200 bpm and potentially up to 230 bpm (unless contraindicated*) to reduce inappropriate therapies, and discrimination algorithms and/or their individual components are contraindicated in patients with complete heart block or if the algorithm/component is known to be unreliable in an individual patient; dual-chamber discriminators that misclassify VT as SVT if the atrial lead dislodges are discouraged in the perioperative period, and dual-chamber discriminators are contraindicated in patients with known atrial lead dislodgment, atrial undersensing or oversensing of far-field R waves, and in those with permanent AF. It is recommended to activate lead failure alerts to detect potential lead problems. It can be useful to program more than one tachycardia detection zone to allow effective use of tiered therapy and/or SVT–VT discriminators and allow for a shorter delay in time-based detection programming for faster arrhythmias. When a morphology discriminator is activated, it is reasonable to re-acquire the morphology template when the underlying morphology match is unsatisfactory, to improve the accuracy of the morphology discriminator.

### Five criteria predict induction and ablation of supraventricular tachycardia [^111P2W68]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Electrophysiological study (EPS) with ablation has supplanted medical management as the primary therapy for supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). Typical success rates range from 80% to 99%. Unfortunately SVT cannot be induced in ~30% of patients who undergo EPS for evaluation of tachycardia. In such cases, the operator cannot be certain whether the symptoms are from SVT or from another arrhythmia such as sinus tachycardia or atrial fibrillation (AF). Identifying an ablation target can be problematic or impossible. Empiric ablation of the slow pathway (SP) region carries the risk of damage to the atrioventricular node requiring a permanent pacemaker. Noninduction of SVT frustrates both the patient and the staff, unnecessarily consumes medical resources, and exposes patients to the inconvenience, discomfort, and risk of the procedure without the benefit of definitive therapy.

Current guidelines recommend EPS and ablation as first‐line therapy for patients with SVT but do not elaborate on which patients with signs and symptoms of tachycardia are most likely to benefit from the procedure. To guide patient selection, we sought to develop an algorithm for predicting whether SVT would be induced or ablated at EPS. In a large population of patients who underwent EPS for treatment of tachycardia, we evaluated a number of preoperative historical and clinical features to determine which ones predicted SVT induction and ablation.

Appropriate use criteria for ICD/CRT — tachyarrhythmias classify atrial arrhythmia scenarios under "Atrial Arrhythmias or 'Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT)' and 'No Standard Pacing Indications'" as follows: paroxysmal atrial arrhythmias A (7); underlying structural heart disease (e.g., ischemic or nonischemic CM) with no known paroxysmal atrial arrhythmias or SVT M (5); structurally normal heart with no known paroxysmal atrial arrhythmias or SVT M (4); and long-standing persistent or permanent atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter with no plans for cardioversion or rhythm control R (1). For known slow ventricular arrhythmias, an active patient with known "slow VT" that overlaps with sinus tachycardia rate is A (8).

### High dose interleukin-2 (aldesleukin)-expert consensus on best management practices-2014 [^116RDEEZ]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Cardiac arrhythmias

There is fairly uniform practice with respect to managing cardiac arrhythmias with serious arrhythmias being uncommon. Sinus tachycardia is to be expected and a new baseline acceptable heart rate of less than 100 beats per minute is generally recorded in the standing orders along with a directive against the use of beta blockers. The rate typically increases after each IL-2 dose, peaks at 2–4 hours and returns to baseline prior to the next dose. It is a compensatory response to hypotension, but is also a consequence of secondary cytokine and stress related epinephrine release and fever. It is important to distinguish the cause in order to avoid unnecessary fluid boluses. The tachycardia seems to become more pronounced and prolonged with an increased number of doses. It usually resolves over time between doses and is back to baseline before the next dose. Some centers extend the time between doses to allow recovery and others hold a dose until the next scheduled administration time.

Isolated premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) are not a contraindication to continued IL-2 dosing, but if the frequency increases (above 10/min), or patterns such as quadrigeminy or couplets or greater arise, holding IL-2 doses until recovery may be necessary. Less common cardiac arrhythmias requiring immediate intervention include supraventricular tachycardia with rapid response, atrial fibrillation with rapid response, and ventricular tachycardia. Patients may continue IL-2, if SVT or atrial fibrillation are converted/controlled, sinus rhythm is maintained or heart rate is controlled and there are no signs of cardiac damage. Ventricular tachycardia requires evaluation for cardiac damage and is an absolute contraindication to more IL-2. Rarely, evidence of myocarditis or pericarditis is noted clinically or on an EKG. This may reflect lymphocytic infiltration. If concerns exist regarding myocarditis or ischemia, then cardiac enzymes or troponin should be monitored at least daily and IL-2 discontinued if confirmed.

### When is it appropriate to prescribe postmenopausal hormone therapy? [^1164dZpo]. Menopause (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To develop evidence and consensus-based recommendations for the use of hormone therapy (HT) in postmenopausal women.

Design

Using evidence from clinical trials and other publications, a multidisciplinary group of women's health experts developed consensus-based recommendations for HT use in more than 300 clinical scenarios. These panelists utilized the RAND Appropriateness Method and a quantitative scale to rate the appropriateness of treatment options for women with various risk factors and clinical scenarios.

Results

The panel judged it appropriate to prescribe all forms of HT to women with intolerable menopause symptoms and usual (age-expected) risks of cardiovascular disease (CVD), venous thromboembolism (VTE), or stroke. Use of HT was judged not appropriate for the clinical scenarios of bone preservation, cosmetic appearance, current memory loss, loss of libido, or CVD protection. For a woman still using HT after 5 or more years, it was considered appropriate to recommend the options of stopping or lowering the dose even if stopping was previously attempted. In treating intolerable symptoms in the presence of some elevated risk for diseases related to HT, route of administration may affect appropriateness but prior stroke or TIA# is a contraindication.

Conclusions

Standard HT is appropriate for women with intolerable menopause symptoms in the absence of HT-related risk factors (eg, CVD, stroke, VTE, breast cancer). Panelists judged it appropriate to repeatedly present the option of stopping or reducing the dose. In most cases, presence of risk factors makes standard-dose oral HT not appropriate; however, some women may be candidates for a different dose or route of administration.

Antitachyarrhythmia devices — pre-implant evaluation and use constraints are specified: Potential recipients of antitachyarrhythmia devices that interrupt arrhythmias should undergo extensive testing before implantation to ensure safe and reliable termination without acceleration or proarrhythmia; when permanent antitachycardia pacemakers detect and interrupt supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), all pacing should be done in the atrium due to risk of ventricular pacing–induced proarrhythmia; and permanent antitachycardia pacing (ATP) as monotherapy for ventricular tachycardia (VT) is not appropriate because tiered-therapy implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) provide cardioversion/defibrillation if ATP fails or accelerates the treated tachycardia.

### Safety and efficacy of paramedic treatment of regular supraventricular tachycardia: a randomised controlled trial [^115RCFWy]. Heart (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Supraventricular tachycardias (SVTs) are a common cause of acute hospital presentations. Adenosine is an effective treatment. To date, no studies have directly compared paramedic-with hospital-delivered treatment of acute SVT with adenosine.

Method

Randomised controlled trial comparing the treatment of SVT and discharge by paramedics with conventional emergency department (ED)-based care. Patients were excluded if they had structural heart disease or contraindication to adenosine. Discharge time, follow-up management, costs and patient satisfaction were compared.

Results

Eighty-six patients were enrolled: 44 were randomised to paramedic-delivered adenosine (PARA) and 42 to conventional care (ED). Of the 37 patients in the PARA group given adenosine, the tachycardia was successfully terminated in 81%. There was a 98% correlation between the paramedics' ECG diagnosis and that of two electrophysiologists. No patients had any documented adverse events in either group. The discharge time was lower in the PARA group than in the ED group (125min (range 55–9513) vs 222min (range 72–26153); p = 0.01), and this treatment strategy was more cost-effective (£282 vs £423; p = 0.01). The majority of patients preferred this management approach. Being treated and discharged by paramedics did not result in the patients being less likely to receive ongoing management of their arrhythmia and cardiology follow-up.

Conclusions

Patients with SVT can effectively and safely be treated with adenosine delivered by trained paramedics. Implementation of paramedic-delivered acute SVT care has the potential to reduce healthcare costs without compromising patient care.

Drug‑induced QT prolongation and management — many marketed cardiac and noncardiac drugs prolong ventricular repolarization and can precipitate life‑threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias; susceptibility may relate to genetic propensity or female gender and more commonly to elevated drug blood levels from excessive dosage, renal disease, or drug interactions. If ventricular arrhythmia may be due to QT prolongation from prescribed medications, the possible offending therapies should be discontinued and follow‑up monitoring of ventricular repolarization and cardiac rhythm should be carried out.

Women with the congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS) — risk patterns and ICD consideration: In women with the congenital LQTS, the risk of cardiac arrest is greater during the postpartum period compared with before or during pregnancy, and the relative tachycardia seen during pregnancy may serve to shorten the QT interval and be protective. Beta blockers can generally be used safely during pregnancy, and use during pregnancy is generally well tolerated by both the mother and the fetus, although a decrease in fetal heart rate can be seen. Multiple observations indicate increased susceptibility in women: the incidence of both congenital and acquired long QT and resultant torsades de pointes is higher in women than in men; in the Long QT Registry, 70% of the subjects and 58% of affected family members are women; and until puberty, males were more likely than females to have cardiac arrest or syncope, with potentially fatal events subsequently predominating in females. Drug-induced torsades de pointes is more common in women than in men. For high-risk patients, ICD therapy should be strongly considered in patients with long-term QT syndromes who are drug resistant and those with marked potential for life-threatening arrhythmias.

### Sex hormones and the QT interval: a review [^116KWbcR]. Journal of Women's Health (2012). Low credibility.

A prolonged QT interval is a marker for an increased risk of ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Both endogenous and exogenous sex hormones have been shown to affect the QT interval. Endogenous testosterone and progesterone shorten the action potential, and estrogen lengthens the QT interval. During a single menstrual cycle, progesterone levels, but not estrogen levels, have the dominant effect on ventricular repolarization in women. Studies of menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) in the form of estrogen-alone therapy (ET) and estrogen plus progesterone therapy (EPT) have suggested a counterbalancing effect of exogenous estrogen and progesterone on the QT. Specifically, ET lengthens the QT, whereas EPT has no effect. To date, there are no studies on oral contraception (OC) and the QT interval, and future research is needed. This review outlines the current literature on sex hormones and QT interval, including the endogenous effects of estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone and the exogenous effects of estrogen and progesterone therapy in the forms of MHT and hormone contraception. Further, we review the potential mechanisms and pathophysiology of sex hormones on the QT interval.

### More reasons why men and women are not the same (gender differences in electrophysiology and arrhythmias) [^115ugCjA]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

It has become increasingly apparent in recent years that there are important differences in the presentation and clinical course of many cardiovascular disorders in men and women. These gender differences extend to clinical cardiac electrophysiology, with respect to basic electrophysiology as well as the presentation and clinical courses of many arrhythmias. Women have been noted to have higher heart rates at rest and longer corrected QT intervals compared with men. Differences in gender hormones may explain some of these findings, but precisely how is still not well understood. Differences have also been documented in the incidence and prevalence of specific arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation, other supraventricular tachycardias, and sudden cardiac death. Variations in arrhythmia frequency with respect to the menstrual cycle have been observed. In addition, an increase in arrhythmia frequency or the new onset of arrhythmias has been noted during pregnancy. With the increasing use of implantable cardioverter defibrillators and cardiac resynchronization therapy, it has been shown that men and women derive equal survival and symptom reduction benefit. However, it has been found that the use of these devices in women is much lower than would be expected from the prevalence of disease in the population. The reasons for this lower utilization rate are not well understood and remain to be explored. In conclusion, the goal of this review is to summarize the currently available published reports regarding gender differences in cardiac electrophysiology and arrhythmias and to provide an update from recent studies.

### Reconsidering the effectiveness and safety of carotid sinus massage as a therapeutic intervention in patients with supraventricular tachycardia [^114efQck]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

The objectives of our investigation were to review the evidence for the efficacy and safety of carotid sinus massage in terminating supraventricular tachycardia and to determine if other potentially less harmful interventions have been established to be safer and more effective.

Methods

A search using PubMed, Ovid, and COCHRANE databases was performed using the terms supraventricular tachycardia, carotid sinus massage, SVT, and CSM. Articles not written in English were excluded. There was a paucity of randomized controlled trials comparing various supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) interventions. However, articles of highest quality were selected for review and inclusion. In addition, articles examining potential hazards of carotid sinus massage in case report format were reviewed, even when performed for other indications other than SVT, as the maneuver is identically performed. Selected articles were reviewed by both authors for relevance to the topic.

Results

Summarizing the findings of this review leads to these 3 fundamental conclusions. First, a therapeutic intervention should only be performed when the benefit of the procedure outweighs its risk. Carotid sinus massage exposes the patient to rare but potentially devastating iatrogenic harm. Second, a therapeutic intervention should be efficacious. The efficacy of carotid sinus massage in terminating supraventricular tachycardia appears to be modest at best. Third, other readily available, easily mastered, and potentially safer and more efficacious alternative interventions are available such as Valsalva maneuver and pharmacologic therapy.

Conclusion

Based on the limited evidence available, we believe that carotid sinus massage should be reconsidered as a first-line therapeutic intervention in the termination of SVT.

Paroxysmal supraventricular and ventricular tachycardias — management when associated with syncope: "In patients with paroxysmal AV nodal reciprocating tachycardia, AV reciprocating tachycardia, or typical atrial flutter associated with syncope, catheter ablation is the first-choice treatment". In these patients, drug therapy "is limited to being a bridge to ablation or when ablation has failed", and for AF or atypical left atrial flutter "the decision should be individualized". For torsade de pointes, "the result of drugs which prolong the QT interval", "Treatment is the immediate discontinuation of the suspected drug". For VT-related syncope, "Catheter ablation or drug therapy should be considered", while "ICD is indicated in patients with syncope and depressed cardiac function, and VT or fibrillation without correctable cause", and "it is indicated to reduce the risk of SCD" despite not usually preventing recurrences.

CONTRAINDICATIONS

Injectable forms of diltiazem are contraindicated in:

Patients with sick sinus syndrome except in the presence of a functioning ventricular pacemaker.

Patients with second- or third-degree AV block except in the presence of a functioning ventricular pacemaker.

Patients with severe hypotension or cardiogenic shock.

Patients who have demonstrated hypersensitivity to the drug.

Intravenous diltiazem and intravenous beta-blockers should not be administered together or in close proximity (within a few hours).

Patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter associated with an accessory bypass tract such as in WPW syndrome or short PR syndrome.

As with other agents which slow AV nodal conduction and do not prolong the refractoriness of the accessory pathway (e.g., verapamil, digoxin), in rare instances patients in atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter associated with an accessory bypass tract may experience a potentially life-threatening increase in heart rate accompanied by hypotension when treated with injectable forms of diltiazem. As such, the initial use of injectable forms of diltiazem should be, if possible, in a setting where monitoring and resuscitation capabilities, including DC cardioversion/defibrillation, are present (see OVERDOSAGE). Once familiarity of the patient's response is established, use in an office setting may be acceptable.

Patients with ventricular tachycardia. Administration of other calcium channel blockers to patients with wide complex tachycardia (QRS ≥ 0.12 seconds) has resulted in hemodynamic deterioration and ventricular fibrillation. It is important that an accurate pretreatment diagnosis distinguish wide complex QRS tachycardia of supraventricular origin from that of ventricular origin prior to administration of injectable forms of diltiazem.

Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for ventricular arrhythmias, more specifically with respect to patients with medication-induced arrhythmia, ACC/AHA/HRS 2018 guidelines recommend to increase the HR with atrial or ventricular pacing or isoproterenol to suppress the arrhythmia in patients with recurrent torsades de pointes associated with acquired QT prolongation and bradycardia unable to be suppressed with IV magnesium administration.
