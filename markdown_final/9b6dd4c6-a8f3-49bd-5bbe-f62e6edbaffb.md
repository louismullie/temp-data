## Question

10.122. The larger base of the trapezoid has a length of 24 cm (Fig. 10.113). Find the length of its smaller base, given that the distance between the midpoints of the diagonals of the trapezoid is 4 cm.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to find the length of the smaller base of a trapezoid, given that the larger base is 24 cm and the distance between the midpoints of the diagonals is 4 cm. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the geometric property that relates the distance between the midpoints of the diagonals to the lengths of the two bases. Then, I should verify the formula and ensure I'm applying it correctly. Next, I will substitute the known values and solve for the unknown smaller base. Finally, I will double-check the arithmetic and state the answer clearly with units.

> Let me first confirm the key geometric property. In a trapezoid, the distance between the midpoints of the diagonals is equal to half the absolute difference of the lengths of the two bases. Mathematically, that is (d = \\frac{|a - b|}{2}), where (a) and (b) are the lengths of the two parallel bases and (d) is the distance between the midpoints of the diagonals [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the formula before proceeding. I initially thought the distance might be the full difference, but that would overestimate it; the correct relationship is indeed half the absolute difference, which aligns with standard geometric derivations for trapezoids and is consistent with how this property is used in problem-solving contexts [^notfound].

> Now, I will substitute the known values. Given the larger base (a = 24) cm, the distance between midpoints (d = 4) cm, and letting the smaller base be (b), the equation becomes (4 = \\frac{|24 - b|}{2}). I should confirm that I'm preserving the absolute value to handle either base being larger, though in this case we already know which is larger [^notfound].

> Next, I should solve for (b). Multiplying both sides by 2 gives (8 = |24 - b|), which implies two cases: (24 - b = 8) or (24 - b = -8). Solving the first case yields (b = 16) cm, and solving the second case yields (b = 32) cm. Hold on, I should verify which solution is valid; since 24 cm is the larger base, the smaller base must be less than 24 cm, so (b = 16) cm is the correct choice and (b = 32) cm is extraneous in this context [^notfound].

> I will now double-check the arithmetic to ensure there are no mistakes. If (b = 16) cm, then (|24–16| = 8), and half of that is 4 cm, which matches the given distance between the midpoints of the diagonals. This confirms the solution is internally consistent and geometrically sound [^notfound].

> Final answer: The length of the smaller base is 16 cm [^notfound].

---

The smaller base of the trapezoid is **16 cm**. This is found using the property that the distance between the midpoints of the diagonals equals half the difference of the bases: (\\frac{24 - x}{2} = 4), which gives (x = 16) cm.

---

## Geometric property of trapezoids

In any trapezoid, the distance between the midpoints of the diagonals is **half the absolute difference of the lengths of the two parallel bases**. This property holds regardless of the trapezoid's height or leg lengths.

---

## Applying the property to the given problem

Let the larger base be (B = 24) cm and the smaller base be (b) cm. The distance between the midpoints of the diagonals is given as 4 cm. According to the property:

[
\\frac{B - b}{2} = 4
]

Substitute (B = 24):

[
\\frac{24 - b}{2} = 4
]

Solve for (b):

[
24 - b = 8
]

[
b = 24–8 = 16
]

---

## Verification

To ensure correctness, we can verify by substituting (b = 16) back into the property:

[
\\frac{24–16}{2} = \\frac{8}{2} = 4
]

This matches the given distance, confirming the solution.

---

The smaller base of the trapezoid is **16 cm**.

### Mouse visual cortex contains a region of enhanced spatial resolution [^bf930d8a]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Optical flow fields during locomotion were computed using data from the visual object-tracking task. The task involved approaching a virtual object on a touchscreen, tracking of the object, and collection of a reward on the other side of the experiment chamber. The experiment chamber had a symmetric trapezoidal shape (width: 24 cm on the touchscreen side and 6 cm on the side with a reward spout opposite to the touchscreen; length: 18 cm; height: 20 cm). A top view camera (Waveshare RPi Camera (F) with 640 × 480 pixels at 30 Hz) centered between the trapezoid legs with a horizontal distance of 12 cm the touchscreen and 30 cm above the ground plane was used to monitor mouse behavior. The position of the animal in the environment was measured by tracking the left and right eye cameras on the animal's head, together with the body center and the bottom corners of the environment using a deep convolutional neural network. Supplementary Fig. 8c shows an example frame with tracking markers. The positions of the bottom corners were used to transform image pixels into real-world coordinates (centimeters) and to align tracked animal positions with the geometry of the environment. Positions of the tracked body parts in the ground (x / y) plane (z = 0 cm) were computed by correcting for the perspective of the top view camera. This required knowledge of the height of the tracked body parts. The typical height of the eye tracking cameras for a straight head (pitch = 0° and roll = 0°) was about 5 cm and we assumed that the height varied linearly with head pitch (7 cm for pitch = 90° and 3 cm for pitch = −90°). For the simulations, body height was kept fixed at 4 cm. Head orientation in the chamber was defined as the unit vector starting at the midpoint between the two eye tracking cameras and pointing to the front (i.e. orthogonal to the line connecting the two eye camera points). For a straight head, the eyes were approximately 1 cm below the midpoint between the eye tracking cameras with an interocular distance of 1 cm. Head pitch but not roll was used to find the midpoint between the eyes and left and right eye positions (relative to the midpoint between the eye cameras) and the vertical component of the head direction vector.

### Coarse-grained fundamental forms for characterizing isometries of trapezoid-based origami metamaterials [^bc85b452]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

In addition to characterizing the kinematics, quantifying the stiffness of the breathing and shearing modes is important for the application of our theory towards origami engineering. Such modal stiffness is frequently modeled via a truss model with Hookean potentials for the folding, bending, and stretching of the panels. In contrast to our theory, such truss models utilize virtual creases across the diagonals of the panels to quantify panel bending. Since our theory attempts to directly model the deflection field of the panels instead, it may be possible to equate the stiffness associated with the vertex amplitudes and the face amplitudes with scaling relations based on the dimensions of the panels and the elastic moduli of the constituent material. This could be especially valuable for the design of impact mitigating origami crash-boxes that utilize trapezoidal faces. Our vision is to extend the utility of the computational design enabled by, e.g. ref.to include the target effective elastic behavior in addition to the target shapes.

Gridness in trapezoid environments

To simulate the effect of asymmetric boundaries in a trapezoid enclosure on gridness, we took cluster positions from simulations after learning in square environments, and ran an additional learning phase for 250,000 trials. In this new learning phase, the shape of the environment was now a trapezoid (the agent could only move to those locations), and the annealed learning rate schedule continued (starting at 0.0025, reducing to 0.002 at the end). The trapezoid dimensions were 5 × 24 × 50 pixels, closely matching the proportions in(0.2 × 0.9 × 1.9 meters; multiplied by (50/1.9) equals to 5.26, 23.7, and 50).

In order to test whether the asymmetric boundaries of the trapezoid affected gridness, the trapezoid was split into two halves and we computed the grid score for the spatial autocorrelogram on the left (wide) and right (narrow) side of the shape. Due to discretization, we split it as close to equal as possible. The wide half extended from the leftmost pixels to the 17th pixel (338 pixels), and the narrow side extended from the 18th pixel to the 50th pixel (339 pixels).

### Collective self-caging of active filaments in virtual confinement [^e5ed295e]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Table 1
Simulation parameters corresponding to the data shown in the main text (unless specified otherwise)

For sufficiently large U 0 and d, filaments experience strong repulsive forces that prevent overlaps and thus reproduce a strictly 2D confinement. Decreasing either of these two parameters, we observe crossing between filaments similar to those reported in the experiments (see Fig. 1 d). Lowering U 0 at fixed d = σ /2 for the filament density used in our simulations, this transition quickly leads to a vanishing of the interactions between filaments, leading to structureless aggregates in the illuminated region. On the other hand, decreasing d at fixed U 0 allows for a larger intermediate regime where filaments can cross each other while still effectively aligning nematically when their density reaches large enough values. As discussed in the main text and shown in Fig. 3, this regime where 0.15 ≲ d / σ ≲ 0.35 precisely corresponds to the emergence of nontrivial patterns at the illumination boundary.

The data presented in Fig. 2 d was obtained by varying the radius of the illuminated disk in the range [5 σ; 80 σ] while keeping the system size fixed. In Fig. 4, we illustrate various geometries with the following specifications: ellipse with major and minor radii of 55 σ and 40 σ, respectively (a), ellipse with major and minor radii of 66 σ and 15 σ, respectively (b), square of side length 50 σ (c), trapezoid with height 55 σ, length of the first base 124 σ, and of the second base 62 σ (d), equilateral triangle with height 80 σ (e), and a teardrop made from one equilateral triangle with height 80 σ and a semicircle with radius 23 σ (f).

### Interdomal ligament of the nose: clarifying the anatomy through a cadaveric study [^808e42ac]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Over the years, the anatomical description of the nasal ligaments has been revisited several times. Although several authors have studied the structures supporting the nasal tip, there is a lack of literature that consistently describes the anatomy of the interdomal ligament. This study analyzed the anatomical variations of the interdomal ligament by describing the possible shapes and dimensions and confirming its ligamentous nature histologically.

Methods

Twenty-five fresh cadaver noses of Caucasian descent, without signs of previous nasal surgery were dissected using an open approach. The interdomal ligament was identified, isolated, measured, and sent for histological examination. The statistical analysis was conducted using Prism9.

Results

The average area of the interdomal ligaments of the whole cohort was 0.39 ± 0.22 cm 2. The mean ligament depth was 0.16 ± 0.05 cm, and the mean interdomal distance was 1.38 ± 0.32 cm. Overall, 58.3% of the ligaments showed a fusiform shape and the rest showed a trapezoidal shape. A correlation between the interdomal distance and length of the ligament was demonstrated with r = [0.7536]. The histological analysis of the interdomal ligament displayed a "fibrous-connective nature of the structure compatible with a ligament".

Conclusions

This study confirmed the ligamentous nature of the interdomal ligament and demonstrated its consistent presence in 24 cadavers, with the depth from the dome ranging from 0.10 to 0.24 cm. The data demonstrated that this ligament may have a fusiform or trapezoidal shape with a mean area of 0.39 ± 0.22 cm 2. Furthermore, a correlation exists between the major base of the ligament and the interdomal distance, with a ratio of 1.633.

### A non-spatial account of place and grid cells based on clustering models of concept learning [^7c3febb5]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Due to the asymmetrical shape of the trapezoid environment, the procedure for generating a movement trajectory above leads to a slightly biased sampling of the wide part of the trapezoid, and less exploration of the middle and top parts of the shape. To deal with this, we made a slight change to the possible steps after generating a step that brings the agent out of the environment, described below. For each trial, the step was generated as before. If the generated step was out of the environment, the step was cancelled, and the next step was determined as follows. If the step generated would have brought the agent out of the bottom of the trapezoid, the next step was sampled from [0, 0, 1, 1] (stay or up). If the step brings the agent out to the top, the next step was sampled from [−1, −1, 0, 0] (down or stay). When the step takes the agent out of the left of the trapezoid, then the next step to be sampled on the horizontal axis were [0, 1, 1, 2, 4], towards the inner portion of the environment. If the step took the agent out of the right side of the trapezoid, the next step was generated as before, from [−4, −2, −1, −1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 4]. This is because when the agent is out of the trapezoid on the horizontal (left-right) axis, the agent could still be in the middle of the shape on the vertical axis, since the shape becomes more narrow as it reaches the right. Finally, when it lands exactly in the middle of the horizontal axis, but is out of the shape (on the horizontal axis), the next step to be sampled from on the vertical axis is [−1, 0, 1].

### Chemical shift encoding using asymmetric readout waveforms [^4b419a89]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

2.1 Designing the asymmetric waveform

The simplest asymmetrical waveform is the asymmetric triangle, described by the durations, and slew ratesof the two segments a and b shown in Figure 1 A. The time‐to‐center, available acquisition time, and area M of the asymmetric triangle are given by the desired shift, echo spacing, and resolution, respectively. With the introduction of the auxiliary variable, the first segment durationis equal toin the case of a positive shift. The triangle amplitude is. For a negative shift, the waveform is mirrored by swapping a and b.

FIGURE 1

The asymmetric triangle achieves a maximum positive shift when. Ignoring the infinite slew rate violation, a shift of onlyis achieved. This geometrical limitation causes the asymmetric triangle waveform to only be viable in sequence with long echo spacing.

To enable larger shifts, we designed a cubic spline‐based waveform, shown in Figure 1 B. As defined in the figure, the waveform is split into a trapezoidal base with amplitudeand an asymmetric component. Sampling is started atwhich is the instant at which the momentis equal to the ramp area of the corresponding trapezoidal waveform. This is also the starting point of the first spline. The presampling durationis known from the phase encoding or crusher gradient duration, whichever is longer. The base amplitude then follows as. With, the base moments are simplyand.

### A non-spatial account of place and grid cells based on clustering models of concept learning [^0ed1395d]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Cluster representations are shaped by environmental geometry

According to the clustering account, grid-like responses should only arise under very specific conditions in which the environment is fairly uniform. The imposition of any structure, including changes to the overall geometry of the environment, should affect the clustering in a manner that makes it less grid-like.

Related, Krupic et al.identified grid cells in rodent mEC in a square box, then placed the animals in a trapezoid environment. They found that activity maps of grid cells became less grid-like in the trapezoid and that the decline was greatest for responses elicited on the narrow side of the trapezoid. To simulate this experiment, the model was first trained in a square and then transferred to a trapezoid environment (see Fig. 4a–d for an example and Fig. S 4 for more examples). As in the empirical studies, the model's overall grid scores declined in the trapezoid environment (Fig. 4e; trapezoid mean grid score: 0.058, bootstrap CIs [0.054, 0.061]; Fig. 4f; square minus trapezoid mean: 0.219, bootstrap CIs [0.214, 0.224]) and the grid scores were higher on the wide than on the narrow side of the trapezoid (Fig. 4g; wide minus narrow mean: 0.133, bootstrap CIs [0.127, 0.139]; see Tables S5 – S7).

### Confidence reports during perceptual decision making dissociate from changes in subjective experience [^a53cb9e3]. Communications Psychology (2025). Medium credibility.

Stimuli

Stimuli consisted of black horizontal lines presented at the centre of the screen over a grey background. The reference line was 400 pixels long, and there were seven possible target lengths that ranged between 370 and 430 in steps of 10 pixels. All stimuli were presented on a 23" (58.4 cm) monitor with a resolution of 1920 × 1080 pixels, at a distance of ~75 cm. At this distance, the size of each pixel was 0.265 mm, or 0.02 visual angle degrees. The monitor refresh rate was 120 Hz. In length reproduction trials, the reproduction line was initially presented with a length of 40 pixels, bounded between 0 and 800 pixels. In the Müller–Lyer condition, each diagonal line that formed the arrowheads on the target line was 60 pixels long and subtended a 45- or 135-degree angle with the horizontal line. The vertical flanking lines in the payoff and base rate conditions were 70 pixels long. All lines had a width of 4 pixels. On each trial, a fixation period (500 ms) was followed by the target line (500 ms), further followed by a second fixation period (500 ms). The experiment was programmed on Python 3.6and PsychoPy (v2020.2.10).

### Coarse-grained fundamental forms for characterizing isometries of trapezoid-based origami metamaterials [^40735425]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Origami sheets are two-dimensional surfaces with predefined creases that control their three-dimensional response to mechanical loads –. The fundamental principle behind the behavior of origami is the difference between the energy scales of elastic deformations that bend the panels (cubic in sheet thickness) and elastic deformations that stretch the panels (linear in sheet thickness). This scaling leads to a quasi-static, low-energy response dominated by the deformations that do not stretch the panels, which we refer to as linear isometries. Since this principle relies solely on the thickness of the sheet, the linear isometries corresponding to a particular crease pattern are largely material independent and therefore realizable in both metallic – and polymeric – materials over a range of length scales. Hence, an understanding of the origami kinematics tends to be more consequential than an understanding of the origami dynamics for the design of origami metamaterials. There are two specific applications of origami kinematics that motivate our work.

The first application of interest is the class of isometries referred to as rigid folding mechanisms that fold the origami sheet along its predefined creases while keeping the panels entirely rigid (no stretching or bending). These rigid folding mechanisms are useful for the deployment and transformation of structures found in various engineering applications including solar arrays, heart stents, and temporary shelters. However, arbitrary quadrilateral-mesh crease patterns are not rigidly foldable and a significant body of work is devoted towards the development of design principles –. Moreover, arbitrary loads can lead to heterogeneous actuation of the mechanism, as well as undesirable deformations due to the existence of isometries distinct from the rigid folding mechanismor the intersection of separate branches in the configuration space. Therefore, efficient models for the response to external loads can inform the methods for deployment and transformation of origami structures along the programmed rigid mechanism without exciting undesirable responses via alternative low-energy instabilities.

### Coarse-grained fundamental forms for characterizing isometries of trapezoid-based origami metamaterials [^cf1beb6d]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

We provide more clarity on these modes by developing unit cell compatibility conditions for the class of TBO with parallel edges that alternate in length. Rather than triangulating the crease pattern as frequently done in previous works –, we separately consider folding degrees of freedom on the vertices, denoted by the vertex amplitudes, and bending degrees of freedom on the faces, denoted by the face amplitudes(see Methods, Linear Isometry Model) as introduced in ref.for the special case of parallelogram-based origami. The amplitude on a vertex maps to changes in the dihedral angles, which are not required to be uniform along the edge unless the isometry is rigid. Instead, a gradient in the folding along a crease generates bending of the adjacent faces, as quantified by the respective face amplitudes. For this reason, constraints on the face amplitudes can be integrated out, thereby yielding compatibility conditions that map from vertex amplitudes to vertex constraints which we illustrate via the compatibility diagrams shown in Fig. 1 A–D(iv). Here, each node is assigned a vertex amplitude and the line style of the edges indicate coupling coefficients that depend on the crease geometry (see Supplementary Note 4). When the coupling coefficients are uniform along the edges, such as in Fig. 1 A(iv), the rigid mode (for all faces) is represented by uniform assignment of vertex amplitudes (for all vertices). In contrast, when the coupling coefficients are nonuniform along the edges, such as in Fig. 1 B(iv), the vertex amplitudes of the rigid mode are proportional to one another to ensure the folding is uniform along the creases. In either case, we find that this family of TBO always exhibits a nonrigid mode represented by uniform face amplitudes (for all faces) and zero vertex amplitudes (for all vertices). Since the breathing (shearing) mode is generated by the rigid (nonrigid) isometry, its modal stiffness depends entirely on the stiffness of the creases (faces). This representation of the isometries effectively integrates the three-dimensional geometry out of the analysis to enable a succinct analytical classification of the modes.

### Five-year biomarker progression variability for Alzheimer's disease dementia prediction: can a complex instrumental activities of daily living marker fill in the gaps? [^eaeef080]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2015). Low credibility.

3.3 Prediction of clinical outcomes

According to our findings, the complex iADL marker explained by far the most variability among both memory and executive declines. Because the data collected with our "complex iADL marker" were raw discriminative values and not binary scores, we calculated both the balanced accuracy (BAC) and the area under the curve (AUC). BAC was defined as the average of the sensitivity and the specificity, obtained by thresholding the prediction values at zero, whereas AUC was calculated using the trapezoid method. Table 4 in the following lists the BAC, sensitivity, and specificity, and AUC over different follow-up durations. The AUC was comparable with previous studies using the "complex iADL marker" for shorter follow-up durations. Table 5 lists the hazard ratio and statistical significance of each variable in the Cox proportional hazards model. Complex iADL marker scores procession was a significant hazard for conversion from both MCI to AD, and cognitively normal to MCI.

### The trapezius perforator flap: an underused but versatile option in the reconstruction of local and distant soft-tissue defects [^25478582]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The trapezius myocutaneous flap is an established reconstructive option in head and neck cases The authors present their experience with 10 trapezius perforator flaps, all raised using a freestyle technique of perforator dissection, to successfully reconstruct both local and distant soft-tissue defects.

Methods

Ten patients underwent soft-tissue reconstruction using trapezius perforator flaps. After mapping the perforator with a handheld Doppler device at the intersection of a horizontal line drawn 6 to 8 cm inferior to the scapular spine and a vertical line drawn 8 to 9 cm lateral to the midline of the back, perforator flaps were raised in a freestyle fashion, with complete preservation of the trapezius muscle. The flap can be pedicled into local defects or transferred as a free flap.

Results

Six flaps were elevated as pedicled flaps and four were transferred as free flaps. Flap size ranged from 6 × 4 cm to 25 × 15 cm. The pedicle length ranged from 4 to 14 cm. The pedicle originated from the dorsal scapular artery. In one case, the authors converted from a pedicled flap to a free flap secondary to insufficient pedicle length. All donor sites were closed directly. The follow-up period ranged from 4 months to 4 years. All of the flaps survived completely with no major complications, and no patients developed any shoulder dysfunction.

Conclusions

The trapezius perforator flap is a reliable and versatile reconstructive option that can be used to repair both local and distant soft-tissue defects. The donor-site morbidity is minimal.

### Coarse-grained fundamental forms for characterizing isometries of trapezoid-based origami metamaterials [^b1465c46]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

The theory developed in the present work connects the discrete representation to the continuum representation of locally uniform isometric deformations in TBO, thereby characterizing their low-energy kinematics at the large scale. It remains to test this theory with more general trapezoid crease patterns via analytical or numerical calculations. However, the underlying principles extend to quadrilateral-mesh origami sheets without parallel edges, where the breathing mode and the shearing mode are coupled along the configuration manifold, as well as axisymmetric origami such as those in refs. –, where the size of the faces changes between cells so that the continuum theory may adopt a conformally flat metric. Furthermore, our methods extend to spatially varying isometries, such as those explored linearly for parallelogram-based origami, (see Supplementary Note 6) and nonlinearly for the cylindrical waterbomb origami, where the fundamental forms and their derivatives are intimately related via the Gauss-Codazzi equations in the continuum regime. Extending our work in this way provides a rich avenue for future investigations that seek to incorporate the large-scale response of origami tessellations into models based on elastic plate theory, where we anticipate sinusoidal variations of mean curvature in the bulk and finite amounts of Gaussian curvature localized towards the boundary of the system. We expect our approximation to improve as the number of cells increases, and the consistency between the response shown in Fig. 1 A–D with crease patterns that have increased numbers of faces in the unit cells, non-isosceles trapezoid faces, and domain walls with parallelogram faces showcases the robustness of our predictions. Furthermore, our focus on geometric mechanics suggests our theory scales with the system size and the isometries should be observable at the sub-millimeter scale on crease patterns fabricated using, e.g. two-photon lithography as used in ref.

### Defining the location of the adductor canal using ultrasound [^ff5cd0ef]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

In this study, the proximal end of the AC was located distal to the midpoint of the thigh, defined as half the distance between the ASIS and base of patella, in all of the 22 subjects.

A recent cadaver study by Anagnostopoulou et alshowed similar results. The proximal end of the AC defined as the "superior foramen of the adductor canal" was distal to the midpoint of the thigh in 13 of the 17 dissected specimens. The mean distance from the midpoint of the thigh to the superior foramen of the AC was 6.5 cm (range, 1.8–10.0 cm) compared to 4.6 cm (range, 2.3–7.0 cm) in our study. Tubbs et alalso performed a dissection study in 16 specimens and reported a mean distance from the ASIS to the proximal border of the VAM of 28.0 cm (range, 20.0–32.0 cm). The AC is roofed by the VAM in its entire length, and hence the proximal border of the VAM marks the beginning of the AC. Consequently, the results from the cadaver study corresponds very well with the results seen in the present study, where the mean distance from the ASIS to the ultrasonographically identified proximal end of the AC was 27.4 cm (range, 24.0–31.4 cm).

### Coarse-grained fundamental forms for characterizing isometries of trapezoid-based origami metamaterials [^a2ff9e7d]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Investigations of origami tessellations as effective media reveal the ability to program the components of their elasticity tensor, and thus control the mechanical behavior of thin sheets. However, existing efforts focus on crease patterns that are composed of parallelogram faces where the parallel lines constrain the quasi-static elastic response. In this work, crease patterns composed of more general trapezoid faces are considered and their low-energy linear response is explored. Deformations of such origami tessellations are modeled as linear isometries that do not stretch individual panels at the small scale yet map to non-isometric changes of coarse-grained fundamental forms that quantify how the effective medium strains and curves at the large scale. Two distinct mode shapes, a rigid breathing mode and a nonrigid shearing mode, are identified in the continuum model. A specific example, which we refer to as Arc-Morph origami, is presented with analytical expressions for its deformations in both the discrete and continuous models. A developable specimen is fabricated and tested to validate the analytical predictions. This work advances the continuum modeling of origami tessellations as effective media with the incorporation of more generic faces and ground states, thereby enabling the investigation of novel designs and applications.

### Climb up! head up! climbing improves posture in Parkinson's disease. A secondary analysis from a randomized controlled trial [^d60e8c38]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2023). Medium credibility.

Sample size considerations were based on the effect of the intervention on the absolute difference in the horizontal distance of the seventh cervical vertebra to the wall before and after 12 weeks. We expected no effect (absolute difference of 0 cm) within the control group, with a standard deviation of 2 cm, based on previous experience. No previously published data was available on the estimated effect in the intervention group.

The available sample size of 48 subjects (24 per group) would show an effect of at least d = 0.73 with a power of 0.8 based on a probability of error of the first kind of 0.05. Given the aforementioned expected characteristics of the control group, this effect size corresponds to an absolute difference of at least 1.4 cm or larger for the intervention group.

2.7 Moment nulling trapezoids

Designing a pair of trapezoids to null zeroth and first moments of a single gradient waveform is common; for spiral imaging, the design of "vector" trapezoid pairs that are played out in both in‐plane directions and are freely rotatable under gradient constraints has not been shown to our knowledge. We have developed a fast algorithm for joint design of this trapezoid pair, which reduces their total duration compared with those made using separate, single‐channel designs. Joint design ensures simultaneous nulling across both axes while maximizing gradient usage without exceeding system limits, resulting in more efficient and symmetric gradient waveforms. Using the notation illustrated in Figure 2, we define variables t a and t b to be the effective total duration (area divided by amplitude) of two trapezoids A and B, respectively, and the effective ramp time t r to be one‐half the actual ramp time. Defining M0 and M1 as the relative gradient moments at the end of spiral waveforms, we write matrix equations for the desired moments of the gradient waveforms and invert them, givingWe enforce these equations in the following iterative solution:

FIGURE 2
Illustration of trapezoids used for pair‐wise design of M1 and M0 nulling with full rotational compatibility.

Step 0: Initialize with t ra = t rb = 0.5*Gmax/Smax, t a = 2 t ra, t b = t rb.

Step 1: Solve for gradient amplitudes, using Equations (19) and (20).

Step 2: Normalize A and B vector gradient amplitudes separately by factorsand, respectively.

Step 3: Solve for new trapezoid durations, using Equation (21).

Iterating these 3 steps converges on a solution quickly. One can modify this approach routine (see code) to account for nontrapezoid (triangular) waveforms.

### Grid cell symmetry is shaped by environmental geometry [^b4e91865]. Nature (2015). Excellent credibility.

Grid cells represent an animal's location by firing in multiple fields arranged in a striking hexagonal array. Such an impressive and constant regularity prompted suggestions that grid cells represent a universal and environmental-invariant metric for navigation. Originally the properties of grid patterns were believed to be independent of the shape of the environment and this notion has dominated almost all theoretical grid cell models. However, several studies indicate that environmental boundaries influence grid firing, though the strength, nature and longevity of this effect is unclear. Here we show that grid orientation, scale, symmetry and homogeneity are strongly and permanently affected by environmental geometry. We found that grid patterns orient to the walls of polarized enclosures such as squares, but not circles. Furthermore, the hexagonal grid symmetry is permanently broken in highly polarized environments such as trapezoids, the pattern being more elliptical and less homogeneous. Our results provide compelling evidence for the idea that environmental boundaries compete with the internal organization of the grid cell system to drive grid firing. Notably, grid cell activity is more local than previously thought and as a consequence cannot provide a universal spatial metric in all environments.

### Cochlear duct length-one size fits all? [^5e3c9508]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

Recent studies demonstrated the utility of high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scans in measuring basal cochlear length and cochlear insertion depths. These studies showed significant variations in the anatomy of the cochlea amongst humans. The aim of our study was to investigate for gender and racial variations in the basal turn length of the human cochlea in an Asian population.

Method

HRCT temporal bone data from year 1997 till 2012 of patients with normally developed cochleae who reported with otologic disease was obtained. Reconstruction of the full basal turn was performed for both ears. The largest distance from the midpoint of the round window, through the midmodiolar axis, to the lateral wall was measured (distance A). Length of the lateral wall of the cochlea to the first turn (360°) was calculated and statistically analyzed.

Results

HRCT temporal bone data from 161 patients was initially obtained. Four patients were subsequently excluded from the study as they were of various other racial groups. Study group therefore comprised of 157 patients (314 cochleae). Mean distance A was statistically different between the two sides of the ear (right 9.09mm; left 9.06mm; p = 0.0069). Significant gender and racial differences were also found. Mean distance A was 9.17mm in males and 8.97mm in females (p = 0.0016). The racial groups were Chinese (39%), Malay (38%) and Indian (22%). Between racial groups, mean distance A was 9.11mm (Chinese), 9.11mm (Malays) and 8.99mm (Indians). The mean basal turn lengths ranged from 19.71mm to 25.09mm. With gender factored in, significant variation in mean basal turn lengths was found across all three racial groups (p = 0.04).

Conclusion

The view of the basal turn of the cochlea from HRCT is simple to obtain and reproducible. This study found significant differences in basal cochlear length amongst male and female Asian patients, as well as amongst various racial groups. This has implications for cochlear electrode insertion as well as electrode array design.

### Experimental study of thermal rectification in suspended monolayer graphene [^4d08d3c1]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

To understand the physical mechanisms of thermal rectification in sample #5, we have performed MD simulation and computed the spatial energy distribution for the propagating phonon modes in the non-equilibrium steady-state for the trapezoid graphene sheet (Methods section). The calculation result is shown in Fig. 7.

Figure 7 shows the calculated thermal rectification factor of trapezoid graphene and its spatial energy distribution for the propagating phonon modes. The MD simulation model is similar but much smaller than the experimental sample. For the smallest MD model, the size of the simulation domain is L = 17 nm, W 1 = 22 nm, W 2 = 2 nm and the total number of C atoms is 7,420. We fix the angle θ in the trapezoid graphene and increase both L and W proportionally, extending the width W 1 to 200 nm, and 440 nm, respectively. There are 2,985,734 C atoms in the MD model for the largest width we considered. It is a formidable task to further extend the MD simulation size to the micrometre scale, due to the tremendously increased computational load at large scale (see the Supplementary Note 7). The MD simulation result demonstrates that the thermal rectification ratio of trapezoid graphene decreases with increasing width (Fig. 7b), following a logarithmic curve. The simulation results agree well with the experimental data. Figure 7c, d indicates that the local energy E of propagating modes is always smaller in the heat flux direction from the narrow end to the wide end. Here, we discuss the spatial energy distribution separately for the high and low temperatures. At the high temperature T h, E at the narrow end of graphene is smaller than that at the wide end, that is, E 4 < E 1. It reveals that the narrow end of graphene has stronger edge scattering effect on the propagating phonon modes than the wide end. Hence, the phonon mean free path and the local energy of propagating modes are smaller at the narrow end. At the low temperature T c, E at the wide end of graphene is smaller than that at the narrow end, that is, E 3 < E 2. This feature is associated with the low energy of propagating modes at the narrow end of graphene under the high-temperature condition. The phonon population density will be higher at the hot side of graphene than that at the cold side. If the hot side is the narrow end, the mean free paths of the large-population phonons will be reduced more. As a result, fewer propagating phonon modes can reach the cold side and the local energy at the cold side (wide end) is relatively small. In other words, the narrow end of graphene at high temperature appears to be the bottleneck for the propagating phonon modes, where the edge scattering affects a larger number of phonons than that at the wide end. In this way, the thermal conductivity in the heat flux direction from the narrow end to the wide end is smaller than that in the opposite direction.

### Fetal blood sampling [^52d16636]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2013). Medium credibility.

Fetal blood sampling — needle gauge and length selection notes that most centers use a 20- or 22-gauge spinal needle; at earlier gestational age (eg, < 24 weeks) it might be preferable to use a 22- (instead of 20-) gauge needle, and in women with a thick panniculus a larger-bore 20-gauge needle may be useful. It is important to measure the distance from skin to target to determine if the standard 9-cm spinal needle length is appropriate, and some operators prefer to run heparin through the needle prior to sampling to prevent formation of a blood clot within the needle.

### A model for the fragmentation kinetics of crumpled thin sheets [^c596c1cd]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Numerical evidence for the insensitivity to initial preparation

Now that the connection between the statistical model of facet area and total crease length has been presented, we briefly note on the insight that may be gained by additionally solving Eq. (1) numerically. A numerical integration scheme is implemented using second-order composite trapezoid rule for discretization in x, and second-order implicit multi-step discretization in t. The sample numerical result in Fig. 5 reveals a rapid convergence to the steady state analytical solution given by Eqs. (7a) and (7b), and thereby relative insensitivity to the initial state. To demonstrate the significance of this behavior, we reiterate the observed history independence of total crease length. As discussed in Gottesman et al. sheets with different loading histories — one hand-crumpled and another deliberately folded along straight lines — yet nearly equal total crease lengths exhibited the same subsequent accumulation of damage when subjected to the protocol of Fig. 1 a. Such sheets had clearly distinct initial facet area distributions: The facet areas of the deliberately folded sheet were sharply peaked near two different values, while those of the hand-crumpled sheet were broadly distributed. Thus, signatures of initial preparation appear to be quickly eclipsed by the strong attractor of the crumpled state, echoed in the rapid convergence to steady state seen numerically.

### Short-term gradient imperfections in high-resolution EPI lead to fuzzy ripple artifacts [^d34730f1]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Figure 3A illustrates the gradient shape and trajectory imperfections for a typical high‐resolution EPI protocol. It can be seen that the strongest gradient imperfections occur at the corners of the trapezoidal pulse shapes, which cannot be adequately corrected for by conventional vendor‐provided Nyquist ghost correction strategies. Instead, a global phase correction scheme may lead to residual phase errors that are distributed differently across representations of low and high spatial frequencies (Figure 3B). In this study, we hypothesized that these mechanisms may partially contribute to the Fuzzy Ripple artifacts.

FIGURE 3
Concept of Fuzzy Ripples as EPI odd‐even delays with ramp sampling with readout (here k x)‐specific phase errors. (A) Gradient imperfections in high‐resolution EPI are most prominent at the corners of trapezoids, including both the rising and falling edges. The nominal EPI trajectory is derived from SIEMENS IDEA simulations, while the measured trajectory is obtained using SKOPE on a standard SIEMENS 7T MAGNETOM with third‐order shimming, at 0.8 mm resolution. (The full protocol parameters:). These data were acquired with a ramp‐sampling ratio of 72%. This means that the largest trajectory error of the trapezoid corners is 28% away from the center of k‐space. This section of the EPI sampling represents relatively low spatial frequencies of the image. First‐order SKOPE coefficients were used to generate trajectories of linear gradients. (B) Despite phase correction in the image reconstruction process that are designed for line‐by‐line delays of conventionally discussed odd‐even artifacts, residual imperfections persist in the part of k‐space that encodes lower spatial frequencies. These residual errors, shown as deviations in k x, manifest as irregular k‐space grids for odd and even lines. Such odd‐even errors are expected to produce EPI ghosting artifacts in low spatial frequencies. This study introduces a strategy to address Fuzzy Ripple artifacts by employing a dual‐polarity EPI approach that alternates the read direction every other TR (see Section 3). EPI images with opposite read directions are anticipated to produce ghosts with opposite phases.

The gradient trajectory imperfections visible in Figure 3 can be described as "short‐term eddy currents" in the range of 50–500 μs. While the vendor's tuneup procedure commonly quantifies five time constants of eddy currents in the typical range of 0.7 ms–5 s, short‐term eddy currents as visible in Figure 3 remain uncorrected in standard procedures.

RBS library design

Initial efforts for training a convolutional neural network (CNN)based on the proof-of-concept data set resulted in a systematic underestimation of RBS strength, in particular for strong RBSs. This is likely due to the library being skewed towards weak sequences as a result of the full randomization of the 17 bases upstream of the Bxb1 start codon (Supplementary Fig. 7). To overcome this, three libraries (High1-3) presumably enriched in moderate-to-strong RBSs were designed in silico based on the proof-of-concept data set and added to a fully randomized library (N 17). Libraries High1 and High2 were designed using position probability matrices (PPMs), 2D matrices in which each element represents the proportion of times a nucleotide occurs at a given position in the sequence. To this end, RBSs from the proof-of-concept data set were grouped into 10 linearly distributed bins according to a proxy for the normalized integral of their flipping profile (IFP trz, contained in [0, 1]), for each of which a PPM was computed. The IFP trz was computed using the trapezoidal rule on the flipping profiles. Degenerate RBS sequences for High1 and High2 were designed with the goal to obtain PPMs that most closely resemble (minimal mean-squared error) the PPMs of the highest and second highest bin, respectively. Library High3 was designed using a genetic algorithm on the basis of predictions from an initial CNN trained on the proof-of-concept data set. The RBS sequences from the three highest IFP trz bins were randomly mutated for 200 iterations (1–2 mutations per sequence and iteration). Only sequences for which the predicted IFP trz was increased due to the mutations were propagated to the next iteration. At the end of this process, we calculated the PPM of the resulting pool of sequences with high predicted IFP trz, randomly selected 20,000 sequences from this PPM, and computed the predicted IFP trz distribution for this sub-sample. Finally, the degenerate RBS sequence of High3 was obtained by greedily minimizing the Kolmogorov–Smirnov distance between the predicted IFP trz distribution of the sub-sample and the predicted IFP trz distribution for the respective degenerate candidate RBS sequence. For further details regarding the computation of the IFP trz, the CNN and the genetic algorithm please refer to the ML Annex.

### Microstructural parameter estimation in vivo using diffusion MRI and structured prior information [^971bef86]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Although the trends we observe suggest that our technique may act as a detector for voxels containing larger axons, the results must be interpreted with caution because of the simplicity of the tissue model used. The three compartment model described by Eq. (1) ignores a great deal of the complexity in real tissue, even in relatively coherent and homogeneous areas of white matter such as the corpus callosum. There has been recent work adding characteristics such as membrane permeability and fiber dispersion and crossing to similar models 40, 41, 42, and distributions of axon radii were included in the AxCaliber model 7. Other factors which may need to be taken into account include the possibility of different T 2 relaxation constants in different tissue compartments (cf. Refs. 43 and 44). Hence, further investigation using more complex models will be required to clarify the source of the contrast observed in our axon radius index maps (Fig. 5). There are also some limitations to our sequence parameterization, such as the assumption of rectangular — rather than trapezoidal — pulses, which were not addressed so as to keep the theoretical signal model analytically tractable. The latter may, however, have only a small influence 45. Finally, we optimized the sequence for axon radii larger than those actually expected in tissue, to make the optimization stable — although it is unlikely that sensitivity to smaller radii could be improved substantially using the same scanner hardware.

In conclusion, we have found that some sensitivity to relatively large axons may be available using the standard DSE pulse sequence at clinical field and gradient strengths, if the scan is well set up and parameter estimation is performed carefully, with the use of suitable prior information. We have demonstrated a consistent trend in axon radius parameter maps which is broadly in keeping with known tissue characteristics, although caution is required in the interpretation of this finding. It may be that contrast arises from large axons of radius around 3 μm and above, although it may also arise from variations in microscopic or macroscopic fiber dispersion (cf. Ref. 46 46), axonal undulation 47, or from differences in other tissue properties such as membrane permeability. In vivo axon radius imaging on clinical scanners should therefore be treated cautiously at present, but as stronger gradients become available on these scanners — a tendency which is beginning to become reality — results will improve, and inferring tissue characteristics should become more practical.

### Chemical shift encoding using asymmetric readout waveforms [^8935a941]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

2.2 Matching the in‐phase echo

A property of the asymmetric readouts, resulting from the dynamic bandwidth, is the non‐uniform k‐space sampling density. We propose to counterbalance this with a matched in‐phase readout to achieve a more balanced total k‐space sampling density in a two‐point RARE sequence. Ideally, the combined fat/water estimates will have an improved SNR transfer function with this approach (described below).

Although constrained to be symmetrical about the k‐space origin, the sampling density of the matched readout can be varied. Instead of a conventional trapezoidal readout with fixed amplitude λ, we investigated a symmetric quadratic readout waveform which matches the CSE readout, illustrated in Figure 2. The constantmatches the asymmetric spline such that the combined effective dwell time at the k‐space center equals that of two trapezoidal in‐phase readouts. That is, the total time spent sampling the k‐space center is the same: The quadratic coefficientis defined by the gradient moment M, the center pointcoinciding with the spin echo, and the constant:

FIGURE 2
Symmetric readout waveforms for in‐phase CSE. A trapezoid and the proposed matched quadratic waveform is shown in (A). The k‐space trajectory over time is shown in (B). The time axis (x) is shared between the plots

A comparison between the sampling densities for trapezoidal and quadratic in‐phase readouts is shown in Figure 3. It is clear that while the density is non‐uniform, the area is consistent between the spline, quadratic, and trapezoidal waveforms because the total readout durations are equal. In contrast, the shifted trapezoidal case shows a uniform distribution but with a smaller area. This is a consequence of less time spent sampling the signal. In Figure 4 D, it is evident that the combined sampling time at the k‐space center is increased and a more uniform density is achieved with the quadratic in‐phase waveform. We hypothesize that the asymmetry of the sampling density can be counterbalanced by using real‐valued k‐space fat/water separation, described below.

We present a practical and accurate way to measure artificial chordae length in mitral valve repair. During preoperative transesophageal echocardiography, the distance between the head of the posterior papillary muscle and the mitral annulus plane at the coaptation of the leaflets is measured; this is the length of the new chorda. Every millimeter of braided 4–0 Gore-Tex (W.L.

### Invariance properties of bacterial random walks in complex structures [^031312fd]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

The effect of size and shape

We have demonstrated that, for a fixed shape, the density of obstacles has a strong effect on the distribution of path lengths while leaving the mean value unchanged as long as the total internal accessible area remains the same.

We will now investigate the effects of shape and size on the path length distributions and again conclude that, although path distributions are very sensitive to the detailed geometry of the domain, mean path lengths and residence times can be accurately predicted using only the surface to perimeter ratio. We fabricate microstructures of circular, squared and triangular shapes all in four different sizes as shown in Fig. 2a. In all structures the obstacle density is fixed to N / S = 0.016 μm −2. All recorded trajectories are also plotted in Fig. 2a with a color map encoding the scaled path length L /. In Fig. 2b we plot for each structure the histogram of path lengths normalized by the expected valuein Eq. 4. As we move from circles to squares and then to triangles we observe that the corresponding histograms are characterized by larger frequencies for both short and long path lengths. The probability of short paths increases as we introduce convex corners and reduce their angle, as evidenced by the blue-violet color of the corners in squared and triangular structures. The presence of longer paths in triangles can be also understood noting that the normalized maximum straight paths for circles, square and triangles are respectively 4/ π,/ π and/ π (see Supplementary Fig. 2). Despite these qualitative and quantitative differences between histograms, mean path lengths are always close to 1 when normalized by the predicted valueas shown in Fig. 2b. The observed path length distributions can be very well reproduced by a Lorentz gas model where collisions with obstacles are described as instantaneous reorientation events. These events are assumed to occur with a constant probability per unit path length given by, where/ π is the rotational average cross section of line obstacles with length b (see Methods). For perfectly straight trajectories, circles and squares have path length distributions with a vertical asymptote. A strong peak is found at the location of this divergence and is progressively smeared as the linear size of the domain becomes larger than the mean free path. Upon increasing the size of the region a peak aroundappears due to bacteria that scatter close to the boundary, reorient and exit. The mix of these two types of trajectories gives rise to the observed double-peak structure. Differently for the triangle no asymptote is present in the P (L) for large λ, therefore only a peak atprogressively appears. These results show that P (L) depends strongly on the random walk properties (as the mean free path), and on the domain features (shape and size). Differently the mean valuesanddepend only on the surface to perimeter ratio of the domain as expressed by Eq. 4. Experimental values ofare shown Fig. 3a for all shapes and sizes. We find an excellent agreement with theory using the same value s = 6.3 μm 2 that was used previously to predict the experimental values ofas a function of the number of obstacles (see Fig. 1c). This value of s has also been used to calculateaccording to Eq. 5 which captures quantitatively well the experimental data as shown in Fig. 3b.

### Chemical shift encoding using asymmetric readout waveforms [^fd398c2c]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

3 METHODS

3.1 Pulse sequence

A RARE sequence was implemented that alternates the acquisition of in and opposed phase echoes between excitations, as shown in Figure 4. All waveform calculations were calculated on‐the‐fly, without delay, according to the prescribed scan parameters. The CSE echo was acquired with the spline waveform, while the in‐phase echo was acquired with a quadratic readout, shown in Figure 2 and described in more detail below. The conventional trapezoid was compared against the quadratic.

FIGURE 3

The dead times are avoided in (B) where asymmetric readout waveforms are used for CSE. The middle rows in (B) show the two investigated in‐phase alternatives: quadratic and prolonged trapezoidal readouts. Shaded areas indicate sampling

Samples were acquired with a constant minimum receiver dwell time (2 μs), using as wide an analog filter bandwidth as possible. A sinc‐based Cartesian gridding procedure 18 was applied with matched filter design to equalize the signal variance. 19 The signal power is related to the sampling density, described by the square root of the sinc integral. τ can be interpreted as the effective dwell time of a gridded sample. The white noise resampling procedure was chosen over uniform signal in order to facilitate apparent SNR measurements in the resampled images. An example of the sampling density is shown in Figure 4. Since the regridding is a one‐dimensional problem and the trajectories are monotonic, fully supported sinc functions are computationally feasible. This also avoids deapodization.

Echocardiographic assessment of right atrial (RA) size — volume by 2D describes that "2D volumetric measurements are usually based on tracings of the blood-tissue interface on the apical four-chamber view" and that "At the tricuspid valve level, the contour is closed by connecting the two opposite sections of the tricuspid ring with a straight line." It adds, "Volumes can be computed by using either the single plane area-length" or "the disks summation technique," performed in a "2D view." The listed advantage is "More representative of actual RA size than linear dimensions," while limitations include "Assumes a symmetrical shape of the cavity," "Single plane volume calculation may be inaccurate since it assumes that RA enlargement is symmetrical," and "Normal values not well established."

### Not as "blurred" as expected? Acuity and spatial summation in the pain system [^fe0907d2]. Pain (2021). Medium credibility.

In line with previous work that used different modalities, our study produced the strongest SSp effect between 6 and 8 cm. This further supports that SSp is modality independent and has similar characteristics regardless of the peripheral input, ie, Aβ, Aδ, or C fibers. An interesting finding is the difference between area-based and the distance-based SSp with the larger effects in the former. These 2 types of SSp, however, can only be contrasted at very small body areas because of the interarea distance of 2 cm used in this study. Previous studies focused either on distance- or area-based SSp, exclusively. Further studies should aim to compare different SSp types using higher numbers of experimental conditions (areas and separations). Such a line of research is fundamental to better understand the spatial properties of the pain system and disentangling spatial summation from, eg, lateral inhibition. It might be important to point out that the current variability of pain responses might have been influenced by lateral inhibition. Especially the responses to stimuli separated by 10 and 12 cm are characterized by a slight reduction in pain intensity, which correspond to an early observation by von Békésy, who showed similar pattern (Fig. 4. pp. 1010), although the stimuli used in that previous experiment were not noxious. Interestingly, greater pain at the 14 cm compared with, eg, 10 cm might also indicate lateral inhibition as at higher separations, this effect might be less prominent.

### Mechanics of the spatiotemporal evolution of sulcal pits in the folding brain [^645021da]. Human Brain Mapping (2025). Medium credibility.

Noting that the early‐stage and later‐stage scans were not all acquired at the same gestational weeks (see Table 1), we examined the diagonal and off‐diagonal SDSP values of longitudinal scans in relation to the early‐stage gestational weeks, later‐stage gestational weeks, and the time gap between longitudinal scans (Figure 7). The SDSP between early‐stage and later‐stage MRI scans was positively associated with early‐stage (first time point) gestational weeks for diagonal cases (Figure 7a, p = 0.0052) but was not significant for off‐diagonal and diagonal values (Figure 7d, p = 0.14). It was negatively associated with later‐stage (second time point) gestational weeks for both values (Figure 7b, p = 0.047 and Figure 7e, p < 10 −6, respectively) and negatively associated with time gaps for both values as well (Figure 7c, p = 6.49 × 10 −4 and Figure 7f, p < 10 −6, respectively). These relationships are expected, as cortical folding progresses and sulcal pits deepen over time. As a result, the SDSP is smaller with earlier stages of brain development and larger with later stages. The variation in MRI scan times may contribute to the mismatch between the early‐stage and later‐stage scans from different cases for the last 13 fetuses in Figure 6. For instance, compared to the early‐stage scan of case 4, its own later‐stage scan has a smaller SDSP than the later‐stage scans of cases 23 and 24. This is caused by the smaller GW of case 4 at the early‐stage scan (smaller SDSP, red line in Figure 7a) and smaller GWs of cases 23 and 24 at the later‐stage scans (larger SDSP, blue line in Figure 7b). The fetuses with smaller GWs typically exhibit smoother brain surfaces, characterized by shallower sulcal pits. For smooth brain surfaces of different cases, subtle variations of sulcal pits are expected, and therefore larger SDSP values were observed between the early‐stage scan of case 4 and later‐stage scans of cases 23 and 24. Figure 7d–f also illustrate that the SDSP between the early‐stage MRI of one fetus and the later‐stage MRI of a different fetus is still affected by both the gestational age at the later time point and the time interval between scans. This is a key factor explaining why some off‐diagonal SDSP values (comparing different fetuses) may exceed the corresponding diagonal values, which reflect within‐fetus comparisons. To put together, the timing of these longitudinal MRI scans is a confounding factor in matching them from the same fetuses. Another contributing factor is the limited MRI scan quality of some of the unmatched cases, which impacted the ability to accurately match the later‐stage brain MRI scans to their early‐stage counterparts based on the similarity of their sulcal pits.

Surgical Design

The present MRAT was designed on the basis of the modified Mohler's principle. Some points, such as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc. were almost the same in both techniques. The details of the surgical landmarks and postoperative situation are shown in Fig. 1, as follows: Point 1 was the peak of Cupid's bow (cphi) on the non-affected side. Point 2 was the deepest point of Cupid's bow. Point 3 was the cphi at the medial segment of the affected side, and L 1~2 (the linear distance between points 1 and 2, and so on) = L 2~3. The vertical distance from points 1 to 3 was H. Point 4, Noordhoff's point, where the vermillion was the widest and started to converge medially at the lateral segment of the affected side. Point 5, subnasale (sn), was the midpoint of the columellar base. Point X was located on the straight-line connecting points 5 with 1, and L X~5 = H, the distance that point 3 should be dropped. Points 6 and 7 were on the nasal floor line of the affected side. In complete clefts, these points were at the mucocutaneous junctions of medial and lateral segments, respectively. In incomplete clefts, the specific positions should ensure equal-width nasal bases. A-flap was formed by sequentially straight connecting points 3, 5, and X. Along the white skin roll, two curves were formed by connecting points 3 and 6, with points 4 and 7, respectively. The red linewas marked on the vermilion on both sides. Point 8 was located on the red line just under point 2, and connected points 3 and 8 as an arc. Point 9 was on arcs 4–7, where the dry lip disappeared.

### Shaping and timing gradient pulses to reduce MRI acoustic noise [^1f631459]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

A method to reduce the acoustic noise generated by gradient systems in MRI has been recently proposed; such a method is based on the linear response theory. Since the physical cause of MRI acoustic noise is the time derivative of the gradient current, a common trapezoid current shape produces an acoustic gradient coil response mainly during the rising and falling edge. In the falling edge, the coil acoustic response presents a 180 degrees phase difference compared to the rising edge. Therefore, by varying the width of the trapezoid and keeping the ramps constant, it is possible to suppress one selected frequency and its higher harmonics. This value is matched to one of the prominent resonance frequencies of the gradient coil system. The idea of cancelling a single frequency is extended to a second frequency, using two successive trapezoid-shaped pulses presented at a selected interval. Overall sound pressure level reduction of 6 and 10 dB is found for the two trapezoid shapes and a single pulse shape, respectively. The acoustically optimized pulse shape proposed is additionally tested in a simulated echo planar imaging readout train, obtaining a sound pressure level reduction of 12 dB for the best case.

Once the T-Arms are folded against the stem, slide the button on the handle completely forward to advance the insertion tube over the tips of the T-Arms (see Figure 4). Only the tips of the T-Arms should be in the insertion tube. Do not advance beyond the copper collars.

IMPORTANT: Do not leave the T-Arms of Paragard bent for more than 5 minutes, as the arms may not open properly.

Step 3: Adjusting the Flange

Once the above steps are completed and Paragard is in the insertion tube, adjust the blue flange. The tray is marked with centimeters and can be used to set the flange to the correct depth (see Figure 5).
Adjust the flange so the distance from the top of Paragard (where it protrudes from the inserter) to the top of the flange is equal to the pre-measured uterine depth.

Figure 5: Adjusting the Blue Flange to sound depth

Step 4: Removing Inserter from Tray

Ensure the button remains in the forward position.
To remove the inserter from the tray, gently lift the handle out of the tray, then gently slide the inserter back and lift out of the tray. (see Figure 6).
Upon removal from the tray, verify and rotate the blue flange as needed so that the horizontal arms of Paragard and the long axis of the blue flange and handle lie in the same horizontal plane to ensure the arms open in the proper direction.
Confirm that both T-Arms are captured within the insertion tube.

### Sarcolemmal excitability properties of the trapezius [^77e3b0d2]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Medium credibility.

5 Conclusions

Overall, the muscle excitability profile of the trapezius, as measured by MVRC and frequency ramp assessments, was similar to that of the more widely studied TA. The minor differences seen are either explained by differences in skin temperature at the time of the recording, or occur in more practically challenging recorded parameters such as frequency ramp peak amplitude recordings. In our experience, the trapezius is an attractive muscle for further studies due to its superficial location, ordered muscle fiber orientation, predictable motor endplate zone, and tolerability. We conclude that the trapezius may be studied in myopathic disorders that preferentially affect the proximal musculature to provide more useful insights into muscle membrane properties in these conditions.

### Trapezial space height measurement after trapeziectomy: a comparison of the use of standard and stress radiographs [^e558484d]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose

To assess whether the behavior of the trapezial space under stress after excision of the trapezium and insertion of a K-wire to hold the thumb metacarpal base away from the distal pole of the scaphoid for 4 weeks is improved by either palmaris longus interposition or ligament reconstruction (LRTI).

Methods

The trapezial space height and trapezial space ratios were assessed on 50 pairs of standard and stress views obtained 1 year after trapeziectomy. Seventeen of the 50 thumbs had simple trapeziectomy, 15 had trapeziectomy plus LRTI and 18 had trapeziectomy with palmaris longus tendon interposition. The reproducibility of these measurements also was assessed.

Results

The 95% limits of agreement for intra- and interobserver differences in the measurement of the trapezial space height were -1 to +1 mm and -2 to +1 mm, respectively. The mean differences between the trapezial heights on the standard and stress radiographs were 1.6 mm (SD, 2.5) for simple trapeziectomy, 1.2 mm (SD, 3.1) for trapeziectomy and LRTI, and 1.2 mm (SD, 2.4) for trapeziectomy with interposition of palmaris longus. The differences between the trapezial space height and trapezial space ratios on the standard and stress radiographs after the 3 different surgeries were not notably different.

Conclusions

Neither the creation of a suspensory ligament nor palmaris longus tendon interposition, as opposed to the isolated placement of a K-wire across the trapezial void for 4 weeks, alters the behavior of the trapezial space under stress at the 1-year follow-up examination. It is thus appropriate to use standard radiographs at the 1-year follow-up examination to assess and compare the trapezial space after these different techniques of trapeziectomy.

Classification system of Eaton and Littler

Adapted from and published with permission from Eaton RG, Littler JW. Ligament reconstruction for the painful thumb carpometacarpal joint. J Bone Joint Surg Am. 1973;55:1655–1666.

The surgical procedure began by exposing the thumb trapeziometacarpal joint using a slightly curved, dorsolateral incision. The capsule of the trapeziometacarpal joint was incised longitudinally with sharp subperiosteal dissection, with care taken to retain the capsule's integrity with the exposure. The capsular attachments to the trapezium and base of the metacarpal, including a limited portion of the insertion of the abductor pollicis longus tendon, were released circumferentially. The trapeziometacarpal joint was exposed at the base of the thumb metacarpal parallel to the articular surface. Only a minimal resection of the damaged articulation was required. The base of the metacarpal was resected parallel to the varus-positioned articular surface (12°–15° in the sagittal plane). Access to the longitudinal axis of the metacarpal was facilitated by adduction and flexion of the thumb. The canal was opened and the canal broaches were inserted. The medullary cancellous bone was compressed progressively until a tight medullary interference fit was achieved. Sizing templates were used to estimate the size of the prosthetic head. The trapezium was prepared with a medium-sized bone burr. Care was taken to medialize the prepared concentric cavity to the adjoining facet with the index metacarpal. Reamers of different sizes were used to prepare the socket. The depth of the socket had to be sufficient to provide stable articulation during a trial reduction with the thumb adducted. The implant is available in four stem and head sizes that are interchangeable. The trial head and stem were implanted and reduced and the prosthetic articulation was tested for joint stability and freedom of movement. If the thumb could not be brought to 60° abduction without undue force, the joint was overstuffed and had to be revised by removing additional bone from the metacarpal or deepening the socket; the modular head and stem were selected with this in mind. A careful capsular closure that sometimes included placing a suture for the beak ligament was performed. The wound was closed with nylon sutures and a splint was applied. Three weeks postoperatively, the sutures and splint were removed and the patients began ROM exercises, with an emphasis on abduction and opposition. Full activity was allowed 6 weeks postoperatively.

### Machine learning model for predicting the conversion to dementia using the cube copying test [^00307683]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Local features

The scoring criteria for the CCT, as described in the instruction manual for the Japanese version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, specify the presence of all necessary lines, absence of unnecessary lines, preservation of parallel relationships between lines, and similarity in their lengths. Since these characteristics are clearly defined, they can be quantitatively analyzed using conventional image-processing techniques based on a rule-based approach. Accordingly, the following procedure was employed to extract these features (Figure 4).

The images were first converted to grayscale, and the Hough transform was applied to detect line segments. Lines were classified as horizontal (angles within −10° to 10° or 170° to 190°), vertical (angles within 80° to 100° or −100° to −80°), or diagonal (all other angles) based on their angles relative to the horizontal direction. After extracting line endpoints, the following features were calculated for horizontal, vertical, and diagonal lines: the number of lines, average and variance of line lengths, and average and variance of the angles between lines of the same type (as a measure of line parallelism). Additionally, the number of vertices was calculated. For the number of lines in each direction (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal) and the number of vertices, the differences from the reference values (four lines in each direction and eight vertices) were computed. The absolute values of these differences were used as feature values.

### Recommendations for cardiac chamber quantification by echocardiography in adults: an update from the American Society of Echocardiography and the European association of cardiovascular imaging [^9a18e059]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2015). Medium credibility.

Left ventricular (LV) volume quantification by echocardiography — acquisition and measurement guidance are as follows: LV volumes should be measured from the apical four- and two-chamber views. Two-dimensional echocardiographic image acquisition should aim to maximize LV areas, while avoiding foreshortening of the left ventricle, which results in volume underestimation. Acquiring LV views at a reduced depth to focus on the LV cavity will reduce the likelihood of foreshortening and minimize errors in endocardial border tracings (Table 1). Because the issue of foreshortening is less relevant in 3D data sets, 3D image acquisition should focus primarily on including the entire left ventricle within the pyramidal data set. To ensure reasonably accurate identification of end-systole, the temporal resolution of 3D imaging should be maximized without compromising spatial resolution. At the mitral valve level, the contour is closed by connecting the two opposite sections of the mitral ring with a straight line. LV length is defined as the distance between the bisector of this line and the apical point of the LV contour, which is most distant to it. The use of the longer LV length between the apical two- and four-chamber views is recommended. Contrast agents should be used when needed to improve endocardial delineation when two or more contiguous LV endocardial segments are poorly visualized in apical views.

Fig. 2
Training and validation of task-optimized and brain-optimized networks.

a An encoding model based on a task-optimized deep neural network (AlexNet; white trapezoid). Multiple convolutional layers (η i) convert the input stimulus on trial t, X t, into feature maps. A read-out head (blue rectangle) transforms network activations into predicted brain activity (r t v, where v indexes a single voxel). The read-out head consists of Gaussian spatial pooling fields (example at lower left) with position and size selected from a fixed grid of candidates (lower right). The pooling field and each feature map are multiplied pixel-wise and then summed, reducing each feature map to a single feature value. The array of feature values across all maps (left vertical rectangle) are weighted by an array of feature weights (w v) and then summed (with a bias term b v) to yield predicted brain activity. Compressive point nonlinearities (f (⋅)) are applied at several processing stages. b A similar architecture is used for the encoding model based on the brain-optimized network (GNet; orange trapezoid depicts a single-branch architecture). The "flexible" spatial pooling fields used in the read-out head may be non-Gaussian (example at lower left). c Training for the AlexNet-based encoding model. For each voxel, only read-out head parameters (g v, w v, b v) are optimized (gears) for visual areas V1–V4 (colored rectangles) in each subjects' brain (S1,…, S8). The "voxelwise loss" (squared difference between predictions and measured activity data) is evaluated independently for each voxel. d Training for the GNet-based encoding model. Both the read-out head and GNet parameters are optimized jointly ("joint loss") for all voxels, subjects and brain areas. e Prediction accuracy is evaluated for each voxel by correlating predicted brain activity with measured brain activity (ρ AlexNet, ρ GNet) across a set of held-out validation trials with natural scenes. We plot the average accuracy (y -axis of central plot) vs. the difference in accuracy (x -axis) for each voxel (dots; color indicates visual area). For this example subject (S1) the GNet-based encoding model predicts responses to natural scenes most accurately for 81.3% of voxels in V1–V4. f In this example, the GNet-based encoding models predicts responses to artificial stimuli more accurately for 88% of voxels in V1–V4.

### Ultrasound-guided peripheral vascular catheterization in pediatric patients: a narrative review [^c8601bbd]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

How do we determine the optimal catheter size?

The determination of catheter size should be based on (1) the relationship between vessel and catheter diameter and (2) the catheter travel distance from skin to vessel. Larger arterial catheters may provide better tracings, easier blood sampling, and longer patency than smaller arterial catheters. However, comparing the use of 18G and 20G catheters in adult patients, the incidence of arterial occlusion after 24 h of cannulation increased linearly, as a larger vessel lumen area was occupied by the catheter. Furthermore, if the catheter occupied up to 20% of the arterial lumen, the occurrence of occlusion was rare.

In pediatric settings, a 24G or 22G catheter, with a diameter of approximately 0.7 or 0.9 mm, respectively, is commonly used. Assuming that the artery is round, a minimum arterial diameter of 1.57 mm is required to not exceed 20% of the arterial lumen when using a 0.7-mm catheter. However, arterial diameter is often below the required diameter, especially in infants and small children, ranging approximately from 0.7 to 1.7 mm. Thus, measuring the internal diameter of the radial artery in young children prior to ultrasound-guided cannulation will ensure a more appropriate selection of catheter size.

In clinical settings that may require large amounts of transfusion or blood transfusion, larger venous catheters are preferably used. However, a relatively larger catheter compared with venous diameter is reported as a risk factor of infiltration, a major complication of venous catheterization. Regarding the prevention of infiltration, the catheter diameter should be less than 30% of the venous lumen.

A longer catheter travel distance from skin to vessel is associated with catheter failure, especially dislodgement. A study investigating catheter survival in ultrasound-guided peripheral venous catheterization in adults reported that 100% of intravenous catheters failed when < 30% of the entire length of the catheter was in the vein, 32.4% of intravenous catheters failed when 30–64% of the catheter was in the vein, and no intravenous catheters failed when ≥ 65% of the catheter was in the vein. Furthermore, the risk of catheter failure decreased by 29% for every 5% increase of catheter length located in vein. This evidence is supported by another study investigating the survival of an ultralong peripheral catheter in adults than a standard-length catheter in ultrasound guidance; it reported a markedly higher catheter survival rate when the catheter length in the vein exceeded 2.75 cm.

### Defining the location of the adductor canal using ultrasound [^3436f5f7]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

The precise location of the adductor canal remains controversial among anesthesiologists. In numerous studies of the analgesic effect of the so-called adductor canal block for total knee arthroplasty, the needle insertion point has been the midpoint of the thigh, determined as the midpoint between the anterior superior iliac spine and base of patella. "Adductor canal block" may be a misnomer for an approach that is actually an injection into the femoral triangle, a "femoral triangle block." This block probably has a different analgesic effect compared with an injection into the adductor canal. We sought to determine the exact location of the adductor canal using ultrasound and relate it to the midpoint of the thigh.

Methods

Twenty-two volunteers were examined using ultrasound. The proximal end of the adductor canal was identified where the medial border of the sartorius muscle intersects the medial border of the adductor longus muscle. The distal end of the adductor canal is the adductor hiatus, which was also visualized ultrasonographically.

Results

The mean distance from the anterior superior iliac spine to the midpoint of the thigh was 22.9 cm (range, 20.3–24.9 cm). The mean distance from the anterior superior iliac spine to the proximal end of the adductor canal was 27.4 cm (range, 24.0–31.4 cm). Consequently, the mean distance from the midpoint of the thigh to the proximal end of the adductor canal was 4.6 cm (range, 2.3–7.0 cm).

Conclusions

In all volunteers, the midpoint of the thigh was proximal to the beginning of the adductor canal, suggesting that an injection performed at this level is in fact a femoral triangle block.

The error bars are the standard deviation for N = 108, 108 and 128 samples with different number of strands. c Distribution of increased height values and statistic analysis of height increase on sites with varied length of pcDNA strands. The error bars are the standard deviation for N = 103, 128, 147 and 225 samples with different length of pcDNA strands.

To measure the line width and density of metallized patterns, we designed a small-sized digit 8 pattern with a size of ~65 × 18 nm 2 (Fig. 3a, Supplementary Figs. 9 and 24). After conducting metal plating, we observed a metallized digit 8 occupying approximately half of the origami substrate. AFM measurement revealed that the metallized line width is ~10 nm according, as calculated from the full width at half maximum. The inter-line distance was measured to be 13 nm and the line density was as high as 4.8 × 10 3 m cm −2 (summarized in Table 1). The successful fabrication of ultrafine lines with 10-nm width suggests that this on-origami metal painting method is appropriate for constructing metal nanocircuits with ultrahigh density.

Combined sex- and age-based insertion lengths for zone III

Significant differences were observed when comparing between sexes, age groups and insertion sides. Longer distances were consistently observed in males, elderly and on the right side (Tables 2, 3 and 4). For males, a 17 mm age-related increase of mean mid-zone III distance was observed between the youngest and oldest age group from both insertion sides. On the right side, optimal insertion lengths were 247, 255, 260 and 264 mm, respectively. On the left side these were 239, 243, 253 and 256 mm, respectively.

For females, a bilateral 9 mm increase of mean mid-zone III distance was observed over time. On the right side the distances were 242, 246, 244 and 251 mm while on the left side 234, 239, 238 and 243 mm, respectively. Sex-based elongation differences became larger with increased age. A maximum of 30 mm difference in mean zone III distance exists between the subgroups (Table 4; Fig. 2). For both sexes, not all age-based insertion lengths differed significantly from each other (supplemental Table 2).

Individual superior (blue & yellow symbols) and inferior (green & orange symbols) zone III boundaries for females (a & b) and males (c & d) are plotted

Standardized fixed-distance insertion length for zone I

The minimum and maximum distance from the FAAPs to the inferior boundary of zone I were 280 and 460 mm, respectively. The shortest measured zone I length from all previously published studies was 190 mm. Hypothetically, the minimal absolute distance from the FAAPs to the LSA would therefore be 470 mm. For our sample, the optimal catheter insertion length would be 430 mm (20 mm cranial and caudal extension). This would cause a 'too low' error with partial zone II occlusion in maximal 1.8% of patients with at least a 2 cm proximal error margin to the LSA and 0% LSA occlusion.

### Chemical shift encoding using asymmetric readout waveforms [^4fe21793]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To describe a new method for encoding chemical shift using asymmetric readout waveforms that enables more SNR-efficient fat/water imaging.

Methods

Chemical shift was encoded using asymmetric readout waveforms, rather than conventional shifted trapezoid readouts. Two asymmetric waveforms are described: a triangle and a spline. The concept was applied to a fat/water separated RARE sequence to increase sampling efficiency. The benefits were investigated through comparisons to shifted trapezoid readouts. Using asymmetric readout waveforms, the scan time was either shortened or maintained to increase SNR. A matched in-phase waveform is also described that aims to improve the SNR transfer function of the fat and water estimates. The sequence was demonstrated for cervical spine, musculoskeletal (MSK), and optic nerve applications at 3T and compared with conventional shifted readouts.

Results

By removing sequence dead times, scan times were shortened by 30% with maintained SNR. The shorter echo spacing also reduced < mml:math xmlns:mml = "http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" > < mml:msub > < mml:mi > T < /mml:mi > < mml:mn > 2 < /mml:mn > < /mml:msub > < /mml:math > blurring. Maintaining the scan times and using asymmetric readout waveforms achieved an SNR improvement in agreement with the prolonged sampling duration.

Conclusions

Asymmetric readout waveforms offer an additional degree of freedom in pulse sequence designs where chemical shift encoding is desired. This can be used to significantly shorten scan times or to increase SNR with maintained scan time.

### Short thyromental distance: a predictor of difficult intubation or an indicator for small blade selection? [^d0e5114f]. Anesthesiology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Short thyromental distance (TMD; < 5 cm) has been correlated with difficult direct laryngoscopic intubation in adult patients. The authors hypothesized that a smaller Macintosh curved blade (No. 2 MCB) would improve the predicted difficult laryngoscopy in short-TMD patients over that with a standard Macintosh curved blade (No. 3 MCB).

Methods

In a preliminary study of 11 consenting adults (7 females and 4 males), American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I and TMD ≤ 5 cm, lateral neck radiographs were recorded during laryngoscopy with a No. 2 and No. 3 MCB in sequential fashion. In a prospective clinical study, laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation were evaluated in 83 adult patients with TMD ≤ 5 cm by randomly assigning them to two groups for the blade used at first intubation. Those who failed intubation with the first blade were switched to the alternate blade. In total 100 laryngoscopies and intubations were performed: the No. 2 MCB (n = 50) and the No. 3 MCB (n = 50).

Results

Lateral neck radiographs recorded at the best laryngeal view revealed that the tip of the No. 2 MCB was proximal to the hyoid body with the No. 2 MCB and distal to it with the No. 3 MCB. The intubation distance (C5 to blade tip) on neck radiographs with the No. 2 MCB was significantly greater than it was with the No. 3 MCB for similar anterior jaw displacement. In the clinical study, the laryngoscopic grade with the No. 2 blade was considered easy (median, 2B), better than the grade with the No. 3 MCB (median, 3). When the No. 2 MCB was used, external laryngeal pressure improved the laryngoscopic grade (1, full glottic view) in 46% of patients. In contrast, when the No. 3 MCB was used, pressure improved the grade in only 10% of the patients. Intubation time with the No. 2 MCB was significantly (P < 0.05) less than it was in patients with No. 3 MCB. Overall, 14 patients who failed intubation with the No. 3 MCB were switched to the No. 2 MCB, and intubation was successful with an easy laryngoscopic grade. Three patients who failed intubation with the No. 2 MCB were switched to the No. 3 MCB.

Conclusions

The predicted difficult laryngoscopy and intubation with the use of the adult No. 3 MCB in standard adult patients with a TMD ≤ 5 cm is significantly easier with use of the smaller No. 2 MCB.

Barrett's esophagus (BE) diagnosis — BE should be diagnosed when there is extension of salmon-colored mucosa into the tubular esophagus extending ≥ 1 cm proximal to the gastroesophageal junction with biopsy confirmation of IM (strong recommendation, low level of evidence). Endoscopic biopsy should not be performed in the presence of a normal Z line or a Z line with < 1 cm of variability (strong recommendation, low level of evidence). In the presence of BE, the endoscopist should describe the extent of metaplastic change including circumferential and maximal segment length using the Prague classification (conditional recommendation, low level of evidence). The location of the diaphragmatic hiatus, gastroesophageal junction, and squamocolumnar junction should be reported in the endoscopy report (conditional recommendation, low level of evidence). In patients with suspected BE, at least 8 random biopsies should be obtained; for short (1–2 cm) segments where 8 are unattainable, at least 4 biopsies per cm of circumferential BE and one biopsy per cm in tongues of BE should be taken (conditional recommendation, low level of evidence). In patients with suspected BE and lack of IM on histology, a repeat endoscopy should be considered in 1–2 years to rule out BE (conditional recommendation, low level of evidence).

Skully Care

During the same consultation at the outpatient clinic, standardized photographs were taken with the SC application. This SC application is installed on a smartphone. The SC application is hosted on a certified server (ISO/IEC 27001:2013) and acts according to the law of protection of personal data (General Data Protection Regulation, the Netherlands).

The infant is placed on its back on a table. A photograph of the skull is taken from the vertex view, both the nose and both ears needed to be visible as anatomical landmarks. In case of hair interfering with the examination (eg, visibility of the skull or anatomical landmarks), a standardized cloth skull cap is used. Following this, cranial vault asymmetry index (CVAI) at 30° as a parameter for positional plagiocephaly and cranial index (CI) as a parameter for positional brachycephaly are calculated by an automated algorithm (Figure 1). A horizontal line was drawn touching the anterior helical borders of the ears. The outside of the skull and the midpoint on this line were marked. A vertical line was drawn through the highest point of the nasal dorsum and the midpoint of the horizontal line. The outside of the skull and the midpoint on this line were also marked. From the midpoint of the vertical line 2 oblique lines at 30° were drawn and the outsides of the skull were marked on these lines (Figure 1). A severity scale is connected to SC. CVAI as a parameter for positional plagiocephaly is divided in 5 levels of severity: normal < 3.5; mild ≥ 3.5 and < 6.25; moderate ≥ 6.25 and < 8.75; severe ≥ 8.75 and < 11; very severe ≥ 11. CI as a parameter for positional brachycephaly is divided in 4 levels of severity: normal < 90; mild ≥ 90 and < 95; moderate ≥ 95 and < 100; severe ≥ 100.

Nonlinear mapping of serial positions and ranks.

a Average readout of M = 6 items stored in short-term memory (STM) to perform an immediate serial-recall (ISR) task. Model network and GML learning as in Fig. 3 but receiving only one item per time. Representations of items to recall have sensory noise σ S (k) = σ S (1) + β (k − 1), linearly increasing with the position k in the sequence. For each corruption rate β, 100 trials per item are simulated. GML is learned, requiring the readout to give the position of the represented item. Right, distribution of readouts per item for β = 0.0075 and 0.12 from 10 4 trials post-learning. b Fraction of trials wrongly assigning the order of a specific item at different corruption rates. Item order in the model is given by the serial position between 1 and M nearest to the readout y. c Fraction of tested sequences with different lengths M perfectly recalled at varying β. A perfect recall occurs when the serial positions of all the M items are correctly readout by the model with learned GML. The curves are averaged over 100 independent simulations. d Average readout in the same model network learning to perform the TI task as in Fig. 3 but with a probabilistic reward schedule. The correct choice in each trial is only randomly assigned to the item with the highest rank. The probability that the highest item is the one to choose, decreases logarithmically with its position k (see "Methods"). Such decrease is modulated by the scaling parameter σ. σ = 0 implies no bias (standard TI task, right-top), while σ = 0.35 (right-bottom) determines an increased probability of switching the correct choice. e, f Mean accuracy per symbolic distance and per item (i.e. serial position), respectively, for varying σ in the test phase.

Evidence summary for LGD — The evidence base comprised randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational cohort studies. A prior systematic review reviewed data from 2 RCTs and 3 observational cohort studies with a search ending on December 31, 2015, and an updated search starting January 1, 2016 identified one additional RCT and 9 observational cohort studies. Across RCTs, mean BE length ranged from 2 to 4 cm circumferential and from 5 to 7 cm in the longest extent, with follow-up of 3 years for 2 RCTs and 1 year for 1 RCT. Ablation groups had surveillance endoscopy 6 months after treatment, then annually, whereas surveillance groups had follow-up every 12 months. Two large registries contributed cohorts, from the United Kingdom with 10-year follow-up and from the United States with 2.4 years of follow-up; the other 11 studies had follow-up between 1 and 6 years. Demographics were similar to the RCTs, with mean age between 60 and 70 years and BE length of 4–6 cm.

### Recommendations for cardiac chamber quantification by echocardiography in adults: an update from the American Society of Echocardiography and the European association of cardiovascular imaging [^a90df692]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2015). Medium credibility.

Left ventricle volumetric measurements — LV volumes are measured using 2DE or 3DE, and volume calculations derived from linear dimensions may be inaccurate because they assume a fixed geometric LV shape; accordingly, the Teichholz and Quinones methods for calculating LV volumes from LV linear dimensions are no longer recommended for clinical use, and volumetric measurements are usually based on tracings of the interface between the compacted myocardium and the LV cavity.

### Osseous anatomy of the scapula [^8397e3f1]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2001). Low credibility.

Detailed anatomy and morphometry of the scapula were obtained to provide information for surgical procedures such as hardware fixation, drill hole placement, arthroscopic portal placement, and prosthetic positioning. Twenty-six measurements were made in 15 pairs of scapulas from cadavers. The average length of the scapulas from the superior to the inferior angle was 155 ± 16 mm (mean ± standard deviation). The thickness of the medial border 1 cm from the edge was 4 ± 1 mm. The superior border was sharp and thin, and the suprascapular notch was present as a foramen in two scapulas. The distance from the base of the suprascapular notch to the superior rim of the glenoid was 32 ± 3 mm. The length of the spine from the medial edge of the scapula to the lateral edge of the acromion was 134 ± 12 mm. The anteroposterior width of the spine at 1 and 4 cm from the medial edge was 7 ± 1 and 18 ± 3 mm, respectively; the width at the lateral edge (spinoglenoid notch) was 46 ± 6 mm. The acromion measured 48 ± 5 mm x 22 ± 4 mm and was 9 ± 1 mm thick. The acromial shape was flat in 23%, curved in 63%, and hooked in 14% of scapulas. The distance from the glenoid to the acromion was 16 ± 2 mm. The glenoid dimensions were 29 ± 3 mm (anteroposterior) x 36 ± 4 mm (superoinferior) and faced posterior by 8 ± 4 degrees. Anteroposterior thickness of the head of the scapula 1 cm from the surface was 22 ± 4 mm. The thickness of the coracoid was 11 ± 1 mm. The average length of the coracoacromial ligament was 27 ± 5 mm. Scapulas from male cadavers were significantly larger than scapulas from female cadavers in 19 measurements.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis and management of Barrett's esophagus [^6a17feb0]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — diagnosis of Barrett's esophagus (BE) recommendations: BE should be diagnosed when there is extension of salmon-colored mucosa into the tubular esophagus extending ≥ 1 cm proximal to the gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) with biopsy confirmation of intestinal metaplasia (IM) of the columnar epithelium (strong recommendation, low level of evidence). Endoscopic biopsy should not be performed in the presence of a normal Z line or a Z line with < 1 cm of variability (strong recommendation, low level of evidence). In the presence of BE, the endoscopist should describe the extent of metaplastic change including circumferential and maximal segment length using the Prague classification (conditional recommendation, low level of evidence). The location of the diaphragmatic hiatus, GEJ, and squamocolumnar junction should be reported in the endoscopy report (conditional recommendation, low level of evidence). In patients with suspected BE, at least 8 random biopsies should be obtained; in short (1–2 cm) segments where 8 biopsies may be unobtainable, at least 4 biopsies per cm of circumferential BE and one biopsy per cm in tongues of BE should be obtained (conditional recommendation, low level of evidence). In patients with suspected BE and lack of IM on histology, a repeat endoscopy should be considered in 1–2 years of time to rule out BE (conditional recommendation, very low level of evidence).

### Carbidopa levodopa (Dhivy) [^7613432d]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

DHIVY Tablet

Dhivy tablet has four segments. Each segment contains 6.25 mg of carbidopa and 25 mg of levodopa. The top layer of the tablet (above the dotted line) contains the carbidopa and levodopa. The bottom layer of the tablet (below the dotted line) contains the inactive ingredients.

Table 1: DHIVY Segment Description

How to take 3 Segments (18.75 mg of carbidopa and 75 mg of levodopa)

Hold the DHIVY tablet with 1 hand on each side.
Carefully grasp 1 segment on either side and break the tablet at the groove to get 3 segments containing 18.75 mg of carbidopa and 75 mg of levodopa and 1 segment containing 6.25 mg of carbidopa and 25 mg of levodopa.
Put the remaining 1 segment back into the container and close tightly.

How to take 2 Segments (12.5 mg of carbidopa and 50 mg of levodopa)

Hold the DHIVY tablet with 1 hand on each side.
Carefully grasp 2 segments and break the tablet in half at the groove in the middle to get 2 segments containing 12.5 mg of carbidopa and 50 mg of levodopa each.
Put the remaining 2 segments back into the container and close tightly.

### Standards for quantitative assessments by coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA): an expert consensus document of the Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (SCCT) [^c62a38c1]. Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2024). High credibility.

CCTA assessment of intervened coronary artery segments — treated segment boundaries, stenosis calculation, and illustrative examples specify that the treated coronary segment includes 5 mm proximal and distal to the boundaries of the stent, bioresorbable scaffold or balloon, and in stented segments the treated segment is between dashed lines which are 5 mm away from the edges. Area stenosis is calculated as the percentage lumen reduction at the narrowest section (minimum lumen area relative to the averaged reference areas) measured outside the treated segment (> 5 mm beyond the edges). Imaging limitations include that blooming and beam hardening prevent accurate evaluation of the lumen within metal stents. Examples include a chronic total occlusion with occluded segment of 37.8mm measured along the curved reconstruction and a bifurcation disease annotated as Medina classification 1, 1, 0 with measurement of the angles between the left anterior descending coronary artery and a diagonal branch.

### ACR-SABI-SAR-SPR practice parameter for the performance of computed tomography (CT) enterography [^394d8404]. SPR/SAR/ACR/SABI (2025). High credibility.

Equipment specifications for CT enterography — performance parameters — state that a CT scanner should meet or exceed the following capabilities including MDCT with detector row > 16, helical or volume acquisition enabling single breath-hold abdomen and pelvis images, scan rotation time = 1 sec, minimum slice thickness ≤ 2 mm with maximum slice thickness 3–4 mm, and limiting spatial resolution = 8 lp/cm for = 32 cm DFOV and = 10 lp/cm for < 24 cm DFOV; additional capabilities include creation of multiplanar images (minimum axial and coronal; sagittal as needed) and the use of dual‑energy techniques to create monoenergetic low keV (generally 50 keV) and iodine‑map images that have been found to detect disease with no increased radiation exposure and with the ability to decrease the volume of iodinated contrast media, with low kVp especially useful in smaller or pediatric patients though in larger (or adult) patients this may result in greater noise; equipment performance monitoring should be in accordance with the ACR–AAPM Technical Standard for Diagnostic Medical Physics Performance Monitoring of CT Equipment.

### Medial packing and elastic asymmetry stabilize the double-gyroid in block copolymers [^13626f91]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Notably, our predictions suggest that complex networks, with suitably low elastic asymmetry, can be formed in equilibrium down to surprisingly low tubular volume fractions (at least as low as 15%). In addition to confirmation by SCF computations at even higher segregation strength, the stability of these "narrow tube" networks, as well as the strong dependence of the stability window in the range 0.5 ≲ ϵ ≲ 2.5, should be experimentally accessible via carefully adjusted combinations of branch and segment length asymmetry, along the lines of recent experiments on the effects of elastic asymmetry on complex sphere phase formation. These thermodynamic predictions are predicated on a revised picture of the underlying subdomain packing of chains. We have highlighted how the medial packing motif impacts detailed distributions of IMDS curvature (Fig. 5) and their sharp contrast with skeletal packing motifs Supplementary Fig. 11. Combined with recent advances in spatial mapping of subdomain IMDS shape via 3D tomography (i.e. slice and view scanning electron microscopy), these curvature distributions and their variation with elastic asymmetry and composition would provide at least an indirect fingerprint of medial packing. More direct confirmation of the detailed subdomain packing distribution requires reconstruction of the terminal geometry itself, or if not, spatial maps of the area per chain at the IMDS, both of which motivate experimental approaches to characterize 3D geometry of specifically labeled subregions of complex morphology.
