## Question

preop bloodwork recommendations

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about preoperative bloodwork recommendations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching principle of selective, risk-based testing versus routine testing. Then, I should verify which blood tests are universally recommended across major guidelines. Next, I will stratify by surgical risk and patient-specific factors. After that, I need to check special populations and procedures. Finally, I will integrate timing, stewardship, and a practical decision framework, while double-checking areas of controversy like coagulation testing and pregnancy screening.

> Let me first confirm the foundational principle so I don't jump to conclusions: routine preoperative testing in healthy patients undergoing low-risk procedures is discouraged because it rarely changes management and can cause harm through false positives, delays, and costs, so testing should be individualized to history, comorbidities, and procedure risk [^dd1eb513] [^15120aef] [^263273f2].

> Wait, let me verify the universal recommendation that emerges across high-credibility guidelines: hemoglobin should be measured before major elective surgery in essentially all patients, because preoperative anemia is common, strongly predicts transfusion and adverse outcomes, and is modifiable if detected early. This is a strong, consistent signal from BSH 2024, AoA 2025, and the Frankfurt PBM consensus, and it aligns with ERAS principles to control anemia preoperatively when feasible [^f67d35a6] [^ead718ef] [^25490d34] [^ea3124cf].

> Hold on, I should verify the threshold and timing so I don't overgeneralize: BSH 2024 suggests using hemoglobin less than 130 g/L as a practical threshold to trigger screening for iron deficiency and enhanced PBM measures, and NATA guidance supports checking hemoglobin about 28 days preoperatively to allow time for evaluation and treatment; early detection enables iron repletion, treatment of deficiencies, and, when indicated, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents to reduce transfusion exposure [^1c7fc1a7] [^91625a2a] [^262fae5e].

> Next, I should review coagulation testing, because this is where overuse is common; I need to ensure I don't perpetuate it. Multiple high-credibility hematology guidelines advise against routine preoperative coagulation screens (PT/INR, aPTT, platelet function) in patients without a bleeding history or relevant comorbidity, as these tests have low predictive value and can generate false positives. Instead, obtain coagulation testing selectively for high-bleeding-risk procedures, known liver disease, malnutrition, prolonged antibiotics, sepsis, or when results would change management, and consider viscoelastic testing in the context of major hemorrhage algorithms rather than as a routine screen [^6085555a] [^de8b4df6] [^30f54ec1] [^fdea08f9].

> Let me consider platelet counts carefully; I should double-check the nuance. Routine platelet counts are not recommended before low-risk procedures, but in patients with thrombocytopenia or high-bleeding-risk procedures, platelet thresholds and function matter. For major non-neuraxial surgery, many guidelines consider prophylactic platelet transfusion when the count is below about 50 × 10⁹/L, whereas for tunneled central venous catheters a threshold around 30 × 10⁹/L is used, and importantly, the platelet count alone should not dictate transfusion without considering cause and procedure risk [^3876c683] [^20768a44] [^cdf9f7c4].

> I will now examine renal and hepatic function testing; I need to ensure I tie this to medications and comorbidity. Basic metabolic panel and liver function tests are indicated when the patient has chronic disease, takes medications affecting electrolytes or renal/hepatic function, or when the procedure itself poses risk of renal injury or hepatic stress. In hepatobiliary surgery, preoperative liver function assessment is standard, and in bariatric surgery, comprehensive metabolic and micronutrient panels are recommended to guide optimization and postoperative supplementation planning [^263273f2] [^15515a6c] [^17cb7816].

> But wait, what about glucose testing; should I include fasting glucose routinely? Let me reconsider. Random glucose is reasonable in patients at high risk of undiagnosed diabetes, and A1C is appropriate if results would change perioperative management; in patients with known diabetes, A1C helps assess control and risk, and ambulatory surgery guidance emphasizes perioperative glycemic strategies rather than blanket preop glucose testing in everyone [^263273f2] [^a7ae7671].

> Next, I should review type and screen or crossmatch decisions; I should confirm a risk-based approach. Type and screen is not warranted for procedures with very low transfusion risk, and institutional MSBOS or validated transfusion probability models can guide when to order a type and screen versus a crossmatch. For example, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, thyroidectomy, and many ambulatory procedures generally do not require preoperative type and screen, whereas major orthopedic, cardiac, hepatic, or complex oncologic surgeries do [^0d44c62e] [^5c4c08ca] [^ed6bc5bf].

> I need to ensure I address special populations; let me think about pregnancy screening and pediatrics. For women of childbearing potential undergoing elective surgery, pregnancy testing may be offered or considered when results would alter management; some ambulatory centers use a two-stage approach with preop serum hCG plus day-of-surgery urine testing to mitigate scheduling disruption, though practice varies and shared decision-making is key. In children, avoid routine hemostatic screening; instead, rely on history and targeted testing only if indicated, given low yield and frequent false positives [^e3b50fb6] [^4e447588].

> Hold on, I should verify the timing and stewardship elements so recommendations are actionable. Preoperative evaluation should occur sufficiently early to allow optimization, ideally several days to weeks before surgery, and clinicians should document why each test is ordered to reduce low-value testing. Overuse of preoperative labs remains prevalent and costly, and explicit stewardship with guideline-concordant ordering can reduce waste, phlebotomy, and delays without compromising safety [^ed84bf0f] [^d3660fe2] [^15120aef].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework, and I will double-check it aligns with the evidence. Universal for major elective surgery: obtain hemoglobin with enough lead time to correct anemia. For low-risk procedures in healthy patients: avoid routine labs. For intermediate risk or patients with comorbidities: add selective tests based on history, medications, and procedure, such as BMP for renal disease or diabetes, LFTs for liver disease, and coagulation studies only if bleeding risk or anticoagulation is present. For high-bleeding-risk procedures: consider type and screen, and if significant blood loss is anticipated, align with PBM pathways and transfusion algorithms [^f67d35a6] [^dd1eb513] [^25490d34].

> Finally, I should confirm that I have addressed the key controversies and provided guardrails. Coagulation testing should not be routine, platelet transfusion decisions should integrate etiology and procedure, and pregnancy testing should be individualized. Throughout, anchor decisions to patient history, exam, and procedure risk, and escalate testing only when results are likely to change perioperative management or improve outcomes [^6085555a] [^3876c683] [^e3b50fb6].

Preoperative bloodwork should be **individualized** based on patient history, comorbidities, and procedure risk [^65d7cc85] [^263273f2]. Routine testing is not recommended for low-risk patients; instead, order a **CBC for all patients** to screen for anemia, and add tests only when results will change management [^f67d35a6] [^dd1eb513]. For high-risk patients or procedures, include coagulation studies, renal and hepatic panels, and glucose as indicated [^30f54ec1] [^263273f2]. Pregnancy testing is advised for women of childbearing potential when results would alter management [^e3b50fb6]. Early detection and treatment of anemia reduce transfusions and complications [^25490d34] [^b2a5e94a].

---

## General principles

- **Individualized testing**: Base preoperative bloodwork on patient history, comorbidities, and procedure risk [^65d7cc85] [^263273f2].
- **Avoid routine testing**: Routine testing in low-risk patients is discouraged due to low yield and potential harms [^dd1eb513] [^15120aef].
- **CBC for all**: Obtain a complete blood count (CBC) for all patients to screen for anemia and guide perioperative planning [^f67d35a6] [^ead718ef].

## Recommended preoperative blood tests by patient risk and procedure

| **Patient risk/procedure** | **Recommended tests** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Low-risk patients (ASA I-II, minor procedures) | - CBC only <br/> - No routine coagulation, renal, or hepatic panels unless indicated | - Routine testing rarely changes management [^dd1eb513] <br/> - CBC screens for anemia [^f67d35a6] |
| Intermediate-risk patients or procedures | - CBC <br/> - Basic metabolic panel (BMP) if renal disease, diabetes, or hypertension <br/> - Coagulation studies (PT/INR, aPTT) if bleeding history or anticoagulant use | - Identify modifiable risks <br/> - Guide anesthesia and surgical planning [^263273f2] [^30f54ec1] |
| High-risk patients or procedures (major surgery, cardiac, hepatic, renal disease) | - CBC <br/> - BMP <br/> - Liver function tests (LFTs) <br/> - Coagulation studies <br/> - Glucose/HbA1c if diabetes risk <br/> - Type and screen if transfusion anticipated | - Comprehensive risk assessment <br/> - Prepare for potential complications [^263273f2] [^25490d34] |

---

## Special considerations

- **Pregnancy testing**: Offer to women of childbearing potential when results would alter management [^e3b50fb6].
- **Anemia management**: Detect and treat anemia early to reduce transfusions and complications [^25490d34] [^b2a5e94a].
- **Coagulation testing**: Avoid routine coagulation tests; use selectively based on history and procedure risk [^6085555a] [^de8b4df6].

---

## Evidence-based guidelines

- **ASA guidelines**: Emphasize individualized testing and CBC for all patients [^ed84bf0f] [^c61f01fe].
- **BSH guidelines**: Recommend CBC for major surgery and selective testing based on risk [^f67d35a6] [^1c7fc1a7].
- **Frankfurt consensus**: Strong recommendation for early detection and management of preoperative anemia [^25490d34] [^7db7d2a2].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **CBC for all**: Screen for anemia and guide planning [^f67d35a6] [^ead718ef].
- **Individualized testing**: Based on history, comorbidities, and procedure risk [^65d7cc85] [^263273f2].
- **Avoid routine testing**: Especially in low-risk patients [^dd1eb513] [^15120aef].
- **Early anemia management**: Reduce transfusions and complications [^25490d34] [^b2a5e94a].

---

Preoperative bloodwork should be **tailored** to patient and procedural risk, with CBC for all and additional tests only when indicated. This approach reduces unnecessary testing, detects clinically significant anemia, and optimizes outcomes [^f67d35a6] [^dd1eb513].

Importance

Blood transfusion is one of the most frequently used therapies worldwide and is associated with benefits, risks, and costs.

Objective

To develop a set of evidence-based recommendations for patient blood management (PBM) and for research.

Evidence Review

The scientific committee developed 17 Population/Intervention/Comparison/Outcome (PICO) questions for red blood cell (RBC) transfusion in adult patients in 3 areas: preoperative anemia (3 questions), RBC transfusion thresholds (11 questions), and implementation of PBM programs (3 questions). These questions guided the literature search in 4 biomedical databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Transfusion Evidence Library), searched from inception to January 2018. Meta-analyses were conducted with the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) methodology and the Evidence-to-Decision framework by 3 panels including clinical and scientific experts, nurses, patient representatives, and methodologists, to develop clinical recommendations during a consensus conference in Frankfurt/Main, Germany, in April 2018.

Findings

From 17 607 literature citations associated with the 17 PICO questions, 145 studies, including 63 randomized clinical trials with 23 143 patients and 82 observational studies with more than 4 million patients, were analyzed. For preoperative anemia, 4 clinical and 3 research recommendations were developed, including the strong recommendation to detect and manage anemia sufficiently early before major elective surgery. For RBC transfusion thresholds, 4 clinical and 6 research recommendations were developed, including 2 strong clinical recommendations for critically ill but clinically stable intensive care patients with or without septic shock (recommended threshold for RBC transfusion, hemoglobin concentration < 7 g/dL) as well as for patients undergoing cardiac surgery (recommended threshold for RBC transfusion, hemoglobin concentration < 7.5 g/dL). For implementation of PBM programs, 2 clinical and 3 research recommendations were developed, including recommendations to implement comprehensive PBM programs and to use electronic decision support systems (both conditional recommendations) to improve appropriate RBC utilization.

Conclusions and Relevance

The 2018 PBM International Consensus Conference defined the current status of the PBM evidence base for practice and research purposes and established 10 clinical recommendations and 12 research recommendations for preoperative anemia, RBC transfusion thresholds for adults, and implementation of PBM programs. The relative paucity of strong evidence to answer many of the PICO questions supports the need for additional research and an international consensus for accepted definitions and hemoglobin thresholds, as well as clinically meaningful end points for multicenter trials.

### Practice guidelines for perioperative blood management: an updated report by the American society of anesthesiologists task force on perioperative blood management* [^95994733]. Anesthesiology (2015). Medium credibility.

Perioperative blood management — patient evaluation guidance specifies that preoperative evaluation to identify risk factors for requiring a blood transfusion or adjuvant therapy includes reviewing previous medical records, conducting a patient or family interview, reviewing existing laboratory test results, and ordering additional laboratory tests when indicated. Literature findings state that although reviewing medical records and conducting a patient interview are well accepted practices, comparative studies are insufficient to evaluate their impact; observational studies and case reports indicate conditions such as sickle-cell anemia, clotting factor deficiency, hemophilia, and liver disease may be associated with blood transfusion complications (Category B3/B4-H evidence).

Pregnancy

Positive pregnancy tests were found in 15 patients (0.6% of all patients; 10 on supplementary bloodwork and 5 on day-of-surgery urine testing), a finding supported by the literature (0.3%-1.3% undergoing routine testing). The ASA Practice Advisory for Preanesthesia Evaluation recommends that "pregnancy testing may be offered to female patients of childbearing age for whom the result would alter the patient's medical management", and positive results routinely lead to cancellation of surgery. A recent review of the literature suggests the use of testing in all female patients of childbearing age. Early pregnancy tests take approximately 14 days to become positive while implantation is necessary for serum hCG to become detectable (approximately 6–12 days after fertilization). As such, we recommend a 2-stage approach to preoperative pregnancy testing, including hCG on preoperative bloodwork in addition to day-of-surgery urine hCG testing. Identifying pregnancy earlier (ie, on preoperative bloodwork) is less disruptive to surgical scheduling because it allows time for surgical lists to be adjusted. However, a longer window between preoperative bloodwork and day of surgery increases the chances of a pregnancy being missed, which is why we also advocate for day-of-surgery urine testing for additional risk mitigation. We believe that this testing approach minimizes the chance of elective surgery being done on a pregnant patient, though it is certainly not infallible.

Recommendation 3: institute proactive preoperative interventions to pre-emptively minimize blood loss and to reduce potential transfusion (Grade of recommendation: 1A).

Several proactive actions must be undertaken as soon as possible by physicians and surgeons to optimize patient care and prevent blood loss.

Identification and treatment of anaemia

Anaemia is defined as per the World Health Organization (WHO) using the following haemoglobin thresholds:
11.0 g/dl for children 0 – ≤ 5 years old.
11.5 g/dl for children 5 – ≤ 12 years old.
12.0 g/dl for children 12 – ≤ 15 years old, and non-pregnant women ≥ 15 years old.
11.0 g/dl for pregnant women.
13.0 g/dl for men ≥ 15.0 years old.

Anemia is a common feature in patients undergoing non cardiac surgery with a prevalence of 27–30%. Even if mild anemia, has been associated with an increased risk of allogeneic red blood cell transfusion and increased risk of mortality and morbidity after surgery. Anemia can be classified into four categories: (1) iron deficiency anemia; (2) anemia of chronic disease; (3) anemia of chronic disease with iron deficiency; (4) anemia of other causes. Preoperative screening for iron deficiency is reccomended. Anaemia screening blood tests should be done to identify the types of anaemia, and thereafter to plan the adequate treatment. Blood transfusion is generally considered the fastest way to treat anaemia. However, several concerns exist about this topic; types of transfusion and other available therapeutic modalities will be explored in subsequent recommendations. Selective administration of erythropoietin and/or iron to improve preoperative haemoglobin levels can be useful. Several studies including meta-analyses of placebo-controlled randomized controlled trials (RCT) indicate that erythropoietin with or without iron is effective in reducing the number of patients requiring allogeneic transfusions as well as reducing the volume of allogeneic blood transfused. Conversely, some RCTs reported equivocal findings when preadmission oral iron is compared with either placebo or no iron regarding preoperative haemoglobin levels or perioperative allogeneic blood transfused. In certain emergency surgical situations, there may not be sufficient time to administer some treatments and transfusion may remain the best and only solution in those patients accepting blood products administration. Whenever possible a multidisciplinary, multimodal, programmatic approach to perioperative anemia should be considered.

Static blood markers for liver function assessment

Established blood parameters

Q6: Do routine blood tests before liver resection help identify patients at risk of postoperative liver dysfunction?

Preoperative basic blood parameters should be measured routinely to assist in preoperative patient assessment.

Recommendation grade: Strong | median level of evidence 2− (range 2− to 2+).

Expert panel comment

Single parameters lack a direct, let alone linear, predictive association with postoperative liver dysfunction. It should, however, be noted that single parameters, such as platelet or prealbumin levels, have been demonstrated to show predictive potential for postoperative liver dysfunction and adverse outcomes in patients undergoing resection for HCC, or in patients with Child–Pugh A cirrhosis undergoing resection for primary liver cancers. In more heterogeneous patient populations, single parameters lack sensitivity (low positive predictive value) and might be combined with dynamic liver function tests or other preoperative laboratory values (see question below) to improve their predictive value.

Q7: Does a combination of routine, preoperative laboratory parameters improve the predictive potential for postoperative liver dysfunction?

Preoperative risk assessment should be considered using existing scores based on multiple basic blood parameters, as these deliver higher predictive potential than single markers. For example, combining albumin, bilirubin, and platelet measurements in the APRI/ALBI score has higher predictive value for PHLF than single blood parameters.

Recommendation grade: Strong | median level of evidence 2+ (range 2− to 2+).

### Practice guidelines for perioperative blood management: an updated report by the American society of anesthesiologists task force on perioperative blood management* [^ed84bf0f]. Anesthesiology (2015). Medium credibility.

Perioperative blood management — patient evaluation: Conduct a physical examination of the patient (e.g., ecchymosis, petechiae, pallor) and, if possible, perform the preoperative evaluation well enough in advance (e.g., several days to weeks) to allow for proper patient preparation; review previous medical records and interview the patient or family to identify previous blood transfusion, history of drug-induced coagulopathy, the presence of congenital coagulopathy, history of thrombotic events, and risk factors for organ ischemia which may influence the ultimate transfusion trigger for red blood cells; inform patients of the potential risks versus benefits of blood transfusion and elicit their preferences; review available laboratory test results including hemoglobin, hematocrit, and coagulation profiles, and order additional laboratory tests depending on a patient's medical condition.

### Detection, evaluation, and management of preoperative anaemia in the elective orthopaedic surgical patient: NATA guidelines [^91625a2a]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2011). Low credibility.

Recommendations

Detection of anaemia

Recommendation 1: We recommend that elective surgical patients have an Hb level determination as close to 28 days before the scheduled surgical procedure as possible (Grade 1C).

The Circular of Information for Blood and Blood Productshas recommended that iron, vitamin B 12, folic acid, and erythropoietin be used instead of blood transfusion, 'if the clinical condition of the patient permits sufficient time for those agents to promote erythropoiesis… ' The key phrase relevant to this recommendation is, 'sufficient time… to promote erythropoiesis'. Detection of anaemia as close to 28 days before surgery is recommended for sufficient time for evaluation and management.

Recommendation 2: We suggest that the patient's target Hb before elective surgery be within the normal range (female ≥ 12 g dL⁻¹, male ≥ 13 g dL⁻¹), according to the WHO criteria (Grade 2C).

This recommendation is a suggestion, indicating a lack of panel consensus and evidence on whether elective surgical procedures should be cancelled, representing best practices, for patients who are identified to be anaemic. Delay of elective scheduled surgery for definitive evaluation of newly detected anaemia and associated clinical conditions (nutritional deficiency, chronic renal disease, etc.) will benefit patients and reduce harm, including likelihood of exposure to blood transfusions.

### Improving preoperative haemoglobin using a quality improvement approach to treat iron deficiency anaemia [^b2a5e94a]. BMJ Open Quality (2020). High credibility.

Background

Optimising preoperative Hb, including the treatment of iron deficiency anaemia, is recommended before elective surgery. Recently, this has been driven by the publication of National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) Quality Standards for Transfusion, which state that patients with iron deficiency anaemia who are having surgery should be offered iron supplementation before and after surgery. The NHS and Department of Health PBM initiative has served to promote a multidisciplinary, evidence-based approach to optimise best practice in detecting and managing preoperative anaemia.

NICE states that iron supplementation can reduce the need for blood transfusion and avoid the serious risks that are associated with transfusion. Further, NICE proposes that hospital length of stay and cost to the NHS may be reduced by this intervention. Perioperative blood transfusion is associated with an increased risk of postoperative morbidity and mortality in some surgical patients.

The incidence of anaemia is high in the elective surgical population, between 30% and 40%, depending on diagnostic criteria and the population studied. Anaemia is independently associated with an increased risk of 30-day mortality and morbidity in patients having major non-cardiac surgery. This effect is demonstrated in both mild–moderate and severe anaemia. Furthermore, the addition of a second risk factor (respiratory, cardiac disease, diabetes and sepsis) in combination with anaemia further increases the adjusted OR for 30-day morbidity and mortality. Preoperative anaemia is also associated with increased postoperative blood transfusion; however, as surgery has evolved, the requirements for transfusion have decreased in many specialities, resulting in fewer transfusions. Nonetheless, a higher starting preoperative Hb may avoid the requirement for postoperative blood transfusion in patients who might otherwise have undergone this were they were anaemic preoperatively.

The consensus guidance document published by Muñoz et al in 2017 outlines a summary guideline for improved clinical practice in this area. This expert group recommends a pathway of anaemia management that begins before surgery and manages the patient through to successful recovery and discharge. The group recommends that this should be considered for all patients who are at risk of moderate to high blood loss, defined as > 500 mL.

### Same-day discharge ambulatory surgery centers: the importance of preoperative workup for aesthetic surgery patients [^d5a82839]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

This study is the first to examine how routine preoperative workups can impact perioperative care for aesthetic surgery patients in a same-day discharge ASC setting.

Among our cohort of 2581 consecutive patients, there were a total of 838 abnormal bloodwork results in the same number of patients (32.5%) and 240 abnormal ECGs (9.3%). The most common clinically significant bloodwork abnormality related to hemoglobin, accounting for 24.0% of all bloodwork abnormalities (n = 201, 7.8% of all patients). This result also correlated with the primary alteration in care (pharmaceutical, n = 104, 35.5% of all alterations in care) with iron supplementation being the most prominent (n = 77 patients). This is in keeping with literature findings, which report abnormal routine hemoglobin findings ranging from 1.0% to 33%, with abnormal bloodwork resulting in alterations of care of 1.2% to 9.0%. In regards to ECG, the literature suggests that recommended ECG testing resulted in abnormal results in 8.3% to 42.7% of patients, and changes to operative care (cancellations/alterations in care) in 1.3% to 20.0%. However, our study found a significantly smaller amount of abnormal ECG results (2.3%) and a similar finding for changes to operative care (2.2% in this study population).

The fact that the vast majority of abnormalities arose from supplementary bloodwork (n = 706, 84.2%) and supplementary ECG (n = 180, 75.0%) was particularly notable. These are patients who would have otherwise not undergone any preoperative testing/investigation based on the "resource-conservation" model of care advocated by many, including the Choosing Wisely and Choosing Wisely Canada guidelines. Furthermore, these abnormal results on preoperative workup led to alterations in care for 242 patients (9.4%), including 44 patients (1.7%) who had their procedure delayed or cancelled because of the abnormal results. Abnormalities on preoperative assessment were significantly more common in patients who were over the age of 50 years, female, higher ASA class, and with pre-existing medical comorbidities.

### Autologous blood donation [^73b886ae]. Anesthesiology Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Preoperative autologous blood donation has become accepted as a standard practice in elective surgery. Subsequent improvements in blood safety and evolving surgical techniques resulting in less blood loss have caused a national decline in preoperative autologous blood donation by approximately 50%. Nevertheless, the continuing emergence of new pathogens and the potential for severe blood inventory shortages continue to give preoperative autologous blood donation an important role in blood conservation strategies.

### Preoperative assessment of adults undergoing elective noncardiac surgery: updated guidelines from the European Society of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care [^65d7cc85]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

When considering whether a patient is fit for surgery, a comprehensive patient assessment represents the first step for an anaesthetist to evaluate the risks associated with the procedure and the patient's underlying diseases, and to optimise (whenever possible) the perioperative surgical journey. These guidelines from the European Society of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine (ESAIC) update previous guidelines to provide new evidence on existing and emerging topics that consider the different aspects of the patient's surgical path.

Design

A comprehensive literature review focused on organisation, clinical facets, optimisation and planning. The methodological quality of the studies included was evaluated using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) methodology. A Delphi process agreed on the wording of recommendations, and clinical practice statements (CPS) supported by minimal evidence. A draft version of the guidelines was published on the ESAIC website for 4 weeks, and the link was distributed to all ESAIC members, both individual and national, encompassing most European national anaesthesia societies. Feedback was gathered and incorporated into the guidelines accordingly. Following the finalisation of the draft, the Guidelines Committee and ESAIC Board officially approved the guidelines.

Results

In the first phase of the guidelines update, 17668 titles were initially identified. After removing duplicates and restricting the search period from 1 January 2018 to 3 May 2023, the number of titles was reduced to 16774, which were then screened, yielding 414 abstracts. Among these, 267 relevant abstracts were identified from which 204 appropriate titles were selected for a comprehensive GRADE analysis. Additionally, the study considered 4 reviews, 16 meta-analyses, 9 previously published guidelines, 58 prospective cohort studies and 83 retrospective studies. The guideline provides 55 evidence-based recommendations that were voted on by a Delphi process, reaching a solid consensus (> 90% agreement).

Discussion

This update of the previous guidelines has covered new organisational and clinical aspects of the preoperative anaesthesia assessment to provide a more objective evaluation of patients with a high risk of postoperative complications requiring intensive care. Telemedicine and more predictive preoperative scores and biomarkers should guide the anaesthetist in selecting the appropriate preoperative blood tests, x-rays, and so forth for each patient, allowing the anaesthetist to assess the risks and suggest the most appropriate anaesthetic plan.

Conclusion

Each patient should have a tailored assessment of their fitness to undergo procedures requiring the involvement of an anaesthetist. The anaesthetist's role is essential in this phase to obtain a broad vision of the patient's clinical conditions, to coordinate care and to help the patient reach an informed decision.

### Proceedings from the society for advancement of blood management annual meeting 2017: management dilemmas of the surgical patient-when blood is not an option [^9884645d]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2019). Medium credibility.

Vigilance is essential in the perioperative period. When blood is not an option for the patient, especially in a procedure/surgery that normally holds a risk for blood transfusion, complexity is added to the management. Current technology and knowledge has made avoidance of blood transfusion a realistic option but it does require a concerted patient-centered effort from the perioperative team. In this article, we provide suggestions for a successful, safe, and bloodless journey for patients. The approaches include preoperative optimization as well as intraoperative and postoperative techniques to reduce blood loss, and also introduces current innovative substitutes for transfusions. This article also assists in considering and maneuvering through the legal and ethical systems to respect patients' beliefs and ensuring their safety.

### An international consensus statement on the management of postoperative anaemia after major surgical procedures [^31773c90]. Anaesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

How does this consensus statement differ from other available statements and/or guidelines?

There are a number of statements and guidelines from professional associations recommending a systematic approach to this problem for the management of pre‐operative anaemia 1, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. Most of these guidelines also recommend the use of a restrictive transfusion threshold for treating acute postoperative anaemia, but recommendations for pharmacological management of anaemia are scarce, or even absent 1, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. We aimed to update and utilise these few current recommendations to provide a working practice document, based on scientific evidence and the clinical experience of an expert panel, on 'how to' feasibly introduce these postoperative anaemia guidelines into clinical practice. Our goal was to provide pragmatic, clear and easy‐to‐follow clinical guidance for the diagnosis and treatment of postoperative anaemia and iron deficiency in order to improve patient recovery, reduce the need for blood transfusion and improve functional outcomes in a cost effective manner. Our recommendations are intended for non‐actively bleeding adult patients in whom all the principles of PBM have been implemented pre‐ and intra‐operatively for the prevention of postoperative iron deficiency and anaemia.

### Detection, evaluation, and management of preoperative anaemia in the elective orthopaedic surgical patient: NATA guidelines [^52856312]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2011). Low credibility.

After completion of the systematic review and meta-analyses and compilation of the evidence into strategically structured tables by the two primary reviewers, a task force consisting of clinical and methodological experts reviewed findings to assess the evidence and provide appropriate recommendations for clinical practice. These findings were reviewed in the context of two panel meetings, and via both telephone and electronic communication.

Members of the task force assessed the quantity, quality, and consistency of the published evidence according to the method proposed by the Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group, using the modified grading system adopted by the American College of Chest Physicians (Fig. 1). The strength of any recommendation depends on two factors: (i) the trade-off between benefits, risks, burden, and cost; and (ii) the confidence in estimates of those benefits and risks (level of evidence). If the trade-off between benefits and risks is clear, the recommendation is strong (Grade 1, 'we recommend'); if the trade-off is less clear — the best action may differ depending on circumstances or patient or society values — the recommendation is weak (Grade 2, 'we suggest'). The evidence supporting the recommendation is graded in three levels according to its methodological strength: high-quality evidence (A), usually from meta-analyses or randomized controlled trials; moderate-quality evidence (B), typically from randomized controlled trials with significant limitations or observational studies with large effects; and low-quality evidence (C), usually from observational studies. The key studies supporting the proposed recommendations are listed and annotated in. This framework provides reviewers with guidelines to pursue a systematic evaluation of published evidence with the ultimate goal of providing physicians with an informed expert opinion of the state of the evidence for an intervention of interest.

### Practice guidelines for perioperative blood management: an updated report by the American society of anesthesiologists task force on perioperative blood management* [^140ede84]. Anesthesiology (2015). Medium credibility.

American Society of Anesthesiologists perioperative blood management — scope and applicability — These Guidelines focus on the perioperative management of patients undergoing surgery or other invasive procedures in which significant blood loss occurs or is expected, including patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass or cardiac surgery, urgent or emergent procedures, obstetric procedures, organ transplantation, noncardiac surgery, patients with pre-existing blood disorders or acquired coagulation deficiency, critically ill patients undergoing surgical or other interventional procedures, and patients who elect not to undergo perioperative transfusion. These Guidelines apply to both inpatient and outpatient surgical settings, and to interventional procedures performed in operating rooms as well as in other locations (e.g., interventional radiology, critical care units) where blood transfusion or other adjuvant therapy is indicated, and are directly applicable to care administered by anesthesiologists and individuals who deliver care under the medical direction or supervision of an anesthesiologist while also serving as a resource for other physicians and patient care personnel involved in perioperative care. Exclusions include neonates, infants, children weighing less than 35 kg, and patients who are not undergoing procedures, and because the physiology of bleeding may be influenced by the vasodilatory effects of anesthetics, for some clinical presentations or surgical situations the recommendations may not apply and practitioners will need to use their judgment in applying the more generalized recommendations.

Preadmission preparation and anemia management — preatmission patient preparation includes (1) treatment of anemia, (2) discontinuation of anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents, and (3) preadmission autologous blood collection. The World Health Organization hemoglobin thresholds identifying anemia are 11.0 g/dl for children 0.50–4.99 yr, 11.5 g/dl for children 5.0–11.99 yr, 12.0 g/dl for children 12.0–14.99 yr and nonpregnant women ≥ 15.0 yr, 11.0 g/dl for pregnant women, and 13.0 g/dl for men ≥ 15.0 yr. Preadmission treatment of anemia includes erythropoietin and/or iron to improve preoperative hemoglobin. Meta-analyses of placebo-controlled RCTs indicate erythropoietin with or without iron is effective in reducing the number of patients requiring allogeneic transfusions and the volume transfused (Category A1-B evidence), while the literature is insufficient to evaluate erythropoietin with iron versus without iron. RCTs report equivocal findings when preadmission oral iron is compared with placebo or no iron regarding preoperative hemoglobin or perioperative allogeneic blood transfused (Category A2-E evidence). Survey findings state erythropoietin with or without iron may be administered when possible to reduce allogeneic blood need in select populations, and consultants and ASA members strongly agree regarding iron administration for iron deficiency anemia if time permits.

### Optimising the pre-operative investigative work up for elective surgical patients [^0d44c62e]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Background

The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) has published a pre-operative guideline (CG3-2003) which categorises all surgical procedures as minor, intermediate, major or major+, and makes recommendations for appropriate pre-operative investigations according to category of surgery and ASA grade (grade 1: normal, healthy patient; grade 2: patient with mild systemic disease; grade 3: patient with severe systemic disease but the disease is not a threat to life). These guidelines aim to standardise the process of pre-operative investigation across the UK, ensuring that a patient receives a profile of pre-operative investigations which reflects the risk associated with the planned surgical procedure, as well as the comorbidities of the patient. For laparoscopic surgery, such as laparoscopic cholecystectomy, the risk of major blood loss is low, and the guidelines therefore advise against the routine provision of a clotting screen or 'group and save' pre-operatively. This is presumed to result in effective stewardship of scarce NHS resources without compromising patient safety.

### Society for Ambulatory Anesthesia updated consensus statement on perioperative blood glucose management in adult patients with diabetes mellitus undergoing ambulatory surgery [^a7ae7671]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2024). Medium credibility.

This consensus statement is a comprehensive update of the 2010 Society for Ambulatory Anesthesia (SAMBA) Consensus Statement on perioperative blood glucose management in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) undergoing ambulatory surgery. Since the original consensus guidelines in 2010, several novel therapeutic interventions have been introduced to treat DM, including new hypoglycemic agents and increasing prevalence of insulin pumps and continuous glucose monitors. The updated recommendations were developed by an expert task force under the provision of SAMBA and are based on a comprehensive review of the literature from 1980 to 2022. The task force included SAMBA members with expertise on this topic and those contributing to the primary literature regarding the management of DM in the perioperative period. The recommendations encompass preoperative evaluation of patients with DM presenting for ambulatory surgery, management of preoperative oral hypoglycemic agents and home insulins, intraoperative testing and treatment modalities, and blood glucose management in the postanesthesia care unit and transition to home after surgery. High-quality evidence pertaining to perioperative blood glucose management in patients with DM undergoing ambulatory surgery remains sparse. Recommendations are therefore based on recent guidelines and available literature, including general glucose management in patients with DM, data from inpatient surgical populations, drug pharmacology, and emerging treatment data. Areas in need of further research are also identified. Importantly, the benefits and risks of interventions and clinical practice information were considered to ensure that the recommendations maintain patient safety and are clinically valid and useful in the ambulatory setting. What Other Guidelines Are Available on This Topic? Since the publication of the SAMBA Consensus Statement for perioperative blood glucose management in the ambulatory setting in 2010, several recent guidelines have been issued by the American Diabetes Association (ADA), the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE), the Endocrine Society, the Centre for Perioperative Care (CPOC), and the Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland (AAGBI) on DM care in hospitalized patients; however, none are specific to ambulatory surgery. How Does This Guideline Differ From the Previous Guidelines? Previously posed clinical questions that were outdated were revised to reflect current clinical practice. Additional questions were developed relating to the perioperative management of patients with DM to include the newer therapeutic interventions.

### Practice guidelines for perioperative blood management: an updated report by the American society of anesthesiologists task force on perioperative blood management* [^644c3f25]. Anesthesiology (2015). Medium credibility.

Preprocedure preparation blood management protocols — Multimodal protocols or algorithms may be employed as strategies to reduce the usage of blood products, although no single algorithm or protocol can be recommended at this time. A restrictive red blood cell transfusion strategy may be safely used to reduce transfusion administration, with determination of whether hemoglobin concentrations between 6 and 10g/dl justify or require red blood cell transfusion based on bleeding, volume status, signs of organ ischemia, and cardiopulmonary reserve; red blood cells should be administered unit‑by‑unit, when possible, with interval reevaluation. A protocol for avoidance of transfusion may be used for patients in whom transfusion is refused or not possible, and transfusion of red blood cells is rarely necessary when the hemoglobin concentration is more than 10g/dl.

### Pre-operative haematological assessment in patients scheduled for major surgery [^6787436a]. Anaesthesia (2016). Low credibility.

Peri-operative anaemia, blood loss and allogeneic blood transfusion are associated with increased postoperative morbidity and mortality, and prolonged hospital stay. A multidisciplinary, multimodal, individualised strategy, collectively termed 'patient blood management', may reduce or eliminate allogeneic blood transfusion and improve outcomes. This approach has three objectives: the detection and treatment of peri-operative anaemia; the reduction of peri-operative bleeding and coagulopathy; and harnessing and optimising the physiological tolerance of anaemia. This review focuses on the pre-operative evaluation of erythropoiesis, coagulation status and platelet function. Where possible, evidence is graded systematically and recommended therapies follow recently published consensus guidance.

Most preoperative tests performed on elective surgical patients are normal. Findings influence management in under 3% of patients tested. In almost all cases, no adverse outcomes are observed when clinically stable patients undergo elective surgery, irrespective of whether an abnormal test is identified. Preoperative testing is appropriate in symptomatic patients and those with risks factors for which diagnostic testing can provide clarification of patient surgical risk.

### Preoperative testing before noncardiac surgery: guidelines and recommendations [^263273f2]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Preoperative testing (e.g., chest radiography, electrocardiography, laboratory testing, urinalysis) is often performed before surgical procedures. These investigations can be helpful to stratify risk, direct anesthetic choices, and guide postoperative management, but often are obtained because of protocol rather than medical necessity. The decision to order preoperative tests should be guided by the patient's clinical history, comorbidities, and physical examination findings. Patients with signs or symptoms of active cardiovascular disease should be evaluated with appropriate testing, regardless of their preoperative status. Electrocardiography is recommended for patients undergoing high-risk surgery and those undergoing intermediate-risk surgery who have additional risk factors. Patients undergoing low-risk surgery do not require electrocardiography. Chest radiography is reasonable for patients at risk of postoperative pulmonary complications if the results would change perioperative management. Preoperative urinalysis is recommended for patients undergoing invasive urologic procedures and those undergoing implantation of foreign material. Electrolyte and creatinine testing should be performed in patients with underlying chronic disease and those taking medications that predispose them to electrolyte abnormalities or renal failure. Random glucose testing should be performed in patients at high risk of undiagnosed diabetes mellitus. In patients with diagnosed diabetes, A1C testing is recommended only if the result would change perioperative management. A complete blood count is indicated for patients with diseases that increase the risk of anemia or patients in whom significant perioperative blood loss is anticipated. Coagulation studies are reserved for patients with a history of bleeding or medical conditions that predispose them to bleeding, and for those taking anticoagulants. Patients in their usual state of health who are undergoing cataract surgery do not require preoperative testing.

### Same-day discharge ambulatory surgery centers: the importance of preoperative workup for aesthetic surgery patients [^3068f535]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

See the Commentary on this article.

Healthcare resources are limited, and appropriate utilization of these resources must be considered when balancing high-quality patient care with resource constraints and costs. Recently, there has been a movement in healthcare aimed towards decreasing tests that are considered unnecessary. Guidelines such as Choosing Wisely and Choosing Wisely Canada have been published to aid practitioners in determining which tests and treatments are appropriate for patients across a variety of specialties and settings.

Although this is a safe and thoughtful approach in the era of evidence-based medicine, it may not actually be applicable in the realm of aesthetic surgery. In Canada, most surgical care is provided in hospitals that function within the publicly funded healthcare system. The hospital setting has the benefit of direct access to ancillary services such as diagnostic imaging, laboratory medicine, blood products, and inpatient admission, which act as patient safety "guardrails' in case of emergency. The same cannot be said of the ambulatory surgery center (ASC) setting, where aesthetic surgery is primarily performed. ASCs traditionally function in isolation, separated from the hospital setting both physically and functionally. Major complications that arise in the ASC setting are not only more difficult to immediately manage, but they must also be reported to the provincial accreditation and regulatory organization, which has the authority to suspend or revoke facility accreditations when required. As a result, the bar for ensuring patient safety is often perceived to be much higher by surgeons operating in the ASC setting.

One specific target of the Choosing Wisely guidelines has been the use of routine bloodwork and preoperative investigations. In fact, the Choosing Wisely Canada guidelinesexplicitly state that "conducting baseline laboratory investigations before low-risk non-cardiac surgery contributes little value to perioperative care". Although there is no doubt that they are noncontributory on many occasions, routine investigations can uncover occult disease states that may adversely impact surgical outcomes or planning. This is especially true in the predominantly female aesthetic surgery population, where anemia among women of childbearing years, and cardiovascular disease in postmenopausal womencommonly present with otherwise negative health histories. Both the Canadian Anesthesiologists' Society and American Society of Anesthesiologists Task Force on Preanesthesia Evaluation state that patients being operated in ambulatory surgery settings must have recent and documented health histories, physical examinations, and appropriate laboratory investigations, although neither society explicitly lists the investigations that must be completed for patients undergoing surgery in the ASC setting.

### Preoperative investigation practices for elective surgical patients: clinical audit [^900c5bf3]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The findings of pre-operative investigations help to identify risk factors that may affect the course of surgery or post-operative recovery by contributing to informed consent conversations between the surgical team and the patient, as well as guiding surgical and anesthetic planning. Certainly, preoperative tests are valuable when they offer additional information beyond what can be gathered from a patient's history and physical examination alone. Preoperative testing practices differ significantly among hospitals, and even within the same hospital, clinicians may have varying approaches to requesting tests. This study aimed to investigate preoperative testing practices and compare them with the latest guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).

Methods

This three-month institutionally based study was carried out at the Debre Tabor Comprehensive Specialized Hospital from May 1 to July 30, 2023, including individuals aged 16 years and older who were not pregnant and had undergone elective surgery in the gynecological, orthopedic, and general units. Data on the sociodemographic characteristics, the existence of comorbidities, the invasiveness of surgery, and the tests taken into consideration by the guideline were gathered using a self-administered questionnaire. After rigorously analyzing and revising the results of preoperative investigation approaches, we compared them to the standard of recommendations. Moreover, the data was analyzed and graphically presented using Microsoft Excel 2013.

Results

During the data collection period, 247 elective patients underwent general, orthopedic, and gynecological operations. The majority of patients, 107 (43.32%), were between the ages of 16 and 40 and had an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class one (92.71%). 350 investigations were requested in total. Of these, 71 (20.28%) tests were ordered without a justified reason or in contravention of NICE recommendations.

Conclusions

In our hospital's surgical clinical practice, unnecessary preoperative testing is still common, especially when it comes to organ function tests, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and complete blood counts (FBCs). When deciding whether preoperative studies are required, it is critical to consider aspects including a complete patient history, a physical examination, and the invasiveness of the surgery.

### Perioperative blood transfusion and blood conservation in cardiac surgery: the Society of Thoracic Surgeons and the Society of Cardiovascular Anesthesiologists clinical practice guideline [^41ad2559]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Background

A minority of patients having cardiac procedures (15% to 20%) consume more than 80% of the blood products transfused at operation. Blood must be viewed as a scarce resource that carries risks and benefits. A careful review of available evidence can provide guidelines to allocate this valuable resource and improve patient outcomes.

Methods

We reviewed all available published evidence related to blood conservation during cardiac operations, including randomized controlled trials, published observational information, and case reports. Conventional methods identified the level of evidence available for each of the blood conservation interventions. After considering the level of evidence, recommendations were made regarding each intervention using the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology classification scheme.

Results

Review of published reports identified a high-risk profile associated with increased postoperative blood transfusion. Six variables stand out as important indicators of risk: (1) advanced age, (2) low preoperative red blood cell volume (preoperative anemia or small body size), (3) preoperative antiplatelet or antithrombotic drugs, (4) reoperative or complex procedures, (5) emergency operations, and (6) noncardiac patient comorbidities. Careful review revealed preoperative and perioperative interventions that are likely to reduce bleeding and postoperative blood transfusion. Preoperative interventions that are likely to reduce blood transfusion include identification of high-risk patients who should receive all available preoperative and perioperative blood conservation interventions and limitation of antithrombotic drugs. Perioperative blood conservation interventions include use of antifibrinolytic drugs, selective use of off-pump coronary artery bypass graft surgery, routine use of a cell-saving device, and implementation of appropriate transfusion indications. An important intervention is application of a multimodality blood conservation program that is institution based, accepted by all health care providers, and that involves well thought out transfusion algorithms to guide transfusion decisions.

Conclusions

Based on available evidence, institution-specific protocols should screen for high-risk patients, as blood conservation interventions are likely to be most productive for this high-risk subset. Available evidence-based blood conservation techniques include (1) drugs that increase preoperative blood volume (eg, erythropoietin) or decrease postoperative bleeding (eg, antifibrinolytics), (2) devices that conserve blood (eg, intraoperative blood salvage and blood sparing interventions), (3) interventions that protect the patient's own blood from the stress of operation (eg, autologous predonation and normovolemic hemodilution), (4) consensus, institution-specific blood transfusion algorithms supplemented with point-of-care testing, and most importantly, (5) a multimodality approach to blood conservation combining all of the above.

Regarding perioperative care for perioperative bleeding, more specifically with respect to management of preoperative anemia, assessment and timing of surgery, ESAIC 2023 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining noninvasive hemoglobin monitoring early at indication for surgery/in the pre-anesthesia setting to speed up detection of preoperative anemia and correction.

### The evolution of perioperative transfusion testing and blood ordering [^ed6bc5bf]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2015). Low credibility.

The evolution of modern anesthesia and surgical practices has been accompanied by enhanced supportive procedures in blood banking and transfusion medicine. There is increased focus on the preparation and the use of blood components including, but not limited to, preventing unnecessary type and screen/crossmatch orders, decreasing the time required to provide compatible red blood cells (RBCs), and reducing the waste of limited blood and personnel resources. The aim of this review is to help the anesthesiologist and surgical staff identify patients at highest risk for surgical bleeding. In addition, this review examines how anesthesia and transfusion medicine can efficiently and safely allocate blood components for surgical patients who require transfusions. The following databases were searched: PubMed, EMBASE, Google Scholar, and the Cochrane Library from January 1970 through March 2014. Subsequent reference searches of retrieved articles were also assessed. Several innovations have drastically changed the procedures by which blood is ordered, inventoried, and the speed in which blood is delivered for patient care. Before entering an operating room, patient blood management provides guidance to clinicians about when and how to treat preoperative anemia and intra- and postoperative strategies to limit the patient's exposure to blood components. Timely updates of the recommendations for blood orders (maximum surgical blood ordering schedule) have enhanced preoperative decision making regarding the appropriateness of the type and screen versus the type and crossmatch order. The updated maximum surgical blood ordering schedule reflects modern practices, such as laparoscopy, improved surgical techniques, and use of hemostatic agents resulting in a more streamlined process for ordering and obtaining RBCs. The electronic (computer) crossmatch and electronic remote blood issue have also dramatically reduced the amount of time required to obtain crossmatch-compatible RBCs when compared with the more traditional serologic crossmatch methods. These changes in blood banking methods have resulted in more efficient delivery of blood to surgical patients.

### Right-sizing testing before elective surgery for patients with low risk [^15120aef]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Performing routine preoperative tests (eg, blood tests or electrocardiography) before low-risk surgical procedures in healthy patients does not change management or improve outcomes. However, it can lead to unintended harm. Unnecessary testing may initiate care cascades or a series of avoidable tests and procedures arising from incidental findings. Treatment delays may result as patients await additional preoperative workups before proceeding with low-risk operations. It also incurs excess costs, with estimates noting $18 billion spent annually on low-value preoperative testing and downstream care cascades. These costs burden not only the health care system but also patients, who may face copayments, coinsurance, and missed workdays.

As a result, practice guidelines advise against routine preoperative testing for common, low-risk surgical procedures. Specifically, the Choosing Wisely campaign, in partnership with the Society of General Internal Medicine, the American Society of Anesthesiologists, and the United Kingdom's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, have all recommended against routine preoperative testing since the early 2010s. Nevertheless, preoperative testing remains common, with considerable variation at the hospital level. For example, in a statewide cohort of patients undergoing several low-risk procedures, more than half (52%) had at least 1 low-value preoperative test performed, with hospital testing rates varying widely from less than 20% to more than 80% of cases. Similarly, national data from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program indicates that preoperative testing occurred for most patients (> 50%), with little reduction in rates after the release of the aforementioned guidelines.

Through preliminary work, we have investigated targets for deimplementing unnecessary preoperative testing and demonstrated success in reducing testing within a single hospital system. However, individual interventions have not been integrated into a comprehensive deimplementation strategy for diverse general surgery procedures or systematically used across various health care settings. Therefore, in this quality improvement study, we aimed to conduct a pilot feasibility study of a multifaceted deimplementation strategy entitled Right-Sizing Testing Before Elective Surgery (RITE-Size). The objective was to test and refine the deimplementation strategy across 3 hospitals in Michigan before a planned stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial.

### Detection, evaluation, and management of preoperative anaemia in the elective orthopaedic surgical patient: NATA guidelines [^493a6d70]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2011). Low credibility.

Detection, evaluation, and management of preoperative of anaemia: an algorithm

We propose an algorithm for the detection, evaluation, and management of preoperative anaemia based on the above recommendations (Fig. 2).

Fig 2
Proposed algorithm for the detection, evaluation, and management of preoperative anaemia. SF, serum ferritin; TSAT, transferrin saturation.

If anaemia is detected on a screening sample, evaluation is necessary and begins with an assessment of iron status. If serum ferritin, transferrin saturation levels, or both indicate absolute iron deficiency, referral to a gastroenterologist to rule out a gastrointestinal malignancy as a source of chronic blood loss may be indicated.

If serum ferritin, transferrin saturation values, or both rule out absolute iron deficiency, serum creatinine and GFR determination may indicate CKD and the need for referral to a nephrologist.

When serum ferritin, transferrin saturation values, or both are inconclusive, further evaluation to rule out absolute iron deficiency or inflammation/chronic disease is necessary. A therapeutic trial of iron would confirm absolute iron deficiency. No response to iron therapy would indicate the anaemia of chronic disease, suggesting that ESA therapy be initiated.

These recommendations are intended to provide guidance for preoperative evaluation in the elective surgical patient. Limiting preadmission testing to a few days before the scheduled operative procedure precludes the opportunity to evaluate and manage the patient with unexplained anaemia. The recommended time frame of testing 4 weeks before the scheduled elective procedure ensures that anaemia can be detected, evaluated, and managed appropriately before elective surgery.

Anaemia should be viewed as a serious and treatable medical condition, rather than as simply an abnormal laboratory value. Anaemia is a common condition in surgical patients and is independently associated with increased mortality. The diagnosis of an unexpected anaemia in patients undergoing elective surgery in which significant blood loss is anticipated should be considered an indication for rescheduling surgery until the evaluation is completed. The presence of preoperative anaemia is significantly associated with morbidity and mortality after surgery, thus warranting this recommendation. Treatment of postoperative anaemia should be the focus of investigations for the reduction of perioperative risk. We conclude that implementation of anaemia management in the elective surgery setting will improve patient outcome.

RESULTS

Demographics

Of the 2596 patients reviewed, 2581 met the inclusion criteria for the study (Table 1; Figure 1). The majority of patients were female (n = 2,353, 91.2%) with a mean age of 37.6 years (range, 18–81). Most patients underwent breast/chest surgery (n = 1,557, 60.3%). Overall, 333 patients (12.9%) were smokers (all instructed to quit 1 month pre- and postoperative), and 792 patients (30.7%) had at least 1 medical comorbidity.

Preoperative Workups

All patients underwent an independent preoperative medical history and physical examination with bloodwork. Individuals 45 years and older with no cardiac history underwent supplementary ECG (n = 635, 24.6%). Individuals under 45 years of age with a cardiac history (n = 90, 3.5%) and individuals over age 45 with a significant cardiac history (n = 48, 1.9%) underwent required ECG testing (Table 2).

Abnormalities on Preoperative Workup

In total, 838 patients (32.5%) had abnormalities noted on their preoperative bloodwork, while 240 patients (9.3%) had abnormal ECGs. The majority of abnormalities resulted from supplementary workups for both bloodwork (n = 706, 84.2%; Table 3) and ECG (n = 180, 75.0%; Table 4). Among the patients with abnormal bloodwork results, the most common clinically relevant abnormalities related to aPTT (n = 305, 36.4%), red blood cell count (n = 208, 24.8%), and hemoglobin level (n = 201, 24.0%).

Literature cites 2 recent retrospective studies confirming increased bleeding complications with preoperative NOAC therapy, with 1 study advocating consideration of longer discontinuation periods before elective cardiac surgery. For emergent care, point-of-care thrombin clotting time for dabigatran and anti-factor Xa assays for apixaban and rivaroxaban can aid in determining the anticoagulant effect, and the use of these laboratory tests is recommended if readily available.

### Adherence to evidence-based guidelines for preoperative testing in women undergoing gynecologic surgery [^32eeac2a]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine adherence to evidence-based recommendations for preoperative testing and health care costs associated with excessive testing.

Methods

An institutional review of women who underwent gynecologic surgery between 2005 and 2007 was performed. Data on the type of surgery, age, comorbidities, and perioperative testing was extracted. We noted the preoperative performance of chest X-ray, electrocardiogram, metabolic panel, complete blood count, coagulation studies, liver function tests, and urinalysis. Each test was classified as being guideline-based (appropriate) or non-guideline-based (inappropriate) as described by the National Institute of Clinical Excellence perioperative guidelines.

Results

A total of 1,402 patients were identified. Ninety-five percent of patients underwent all of the guideline-recommended preoperative testing. Ninety percent of women underwent at least one nonindicated preoperative test. None of the 749 urinalyses, 407 liver function tests, or 1,046 coagulation studies performed was appropriate. Ninety-nine percent of the 427 chest X-rays ordered were inappropriate. Only 17% of metabolic panels, 36% of electrocardiograms, and 29% of complete blood counts were in accordance with evidence-based guidelines. Inappropriate perioperative tests led to a direct cost of more than $418,000. Of the inappropriate tests ordered, abnormalities were noted frequently but rarely changed management.

Conclusion

Adherence to evidence-based recommendations for preoperative testing is poor. Inappropriate preoperative tests represent a major health care expenditure.

### Preoperative laboratory investigations: rates and variability prior to low-risk surgical procedures [^1cda5d51]. Anesthesiology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Increasing attention has been focused on low-value healthcare services. Through Choosing Wisely campaigns, routine laboratory testing before low-risk surgery has been discouraged in the absence of clinical indications. The authors investigated rates, determinants, and institutional variation in laboratory testing before low-risk procedures.

Methods

Patients who underwent ophthalmologic surgeries or predefined low-risk surgeries in Ontario, Canada, between April 1, 2008, and March 31, 2013, were identified from population-based administrative databases. Preoperative blood work was defined as a complete blood count, prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin, or basic metabolic panel within 60 days before an index procedure. Adjusted associations between patient and institutional factors and preoperative testing were assessed with hierarchical multivariable logistic regression. Institutional variation was characterized using the median odds ratio.

Results

The cohort included 906,902 patients who underwent 1,330,466 procedures (57.1% ophthalmologic and 42.9% low-risk surgery) at 119 institutions. Preoperative blood work preceded 400,058 (30.1%) procedures. The unadjusted institutional rate of preoperative blood work varied widely (0.0 to 98.1%). In regression modeling, significant predictors of preoperative testing included atrial fibrillation (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 2.58; 95% CI, 2.51 to 2.66), preoperative medical consultation (AOR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.65 to 1.71), previous mitral valve replacement (AOR, 2.33; 95% CI, 2.10 to 2.58), and liver disease (AOR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.55 to 1.84). The median odds ratio for interinstitutional variation was 2.43.

Conclusions

Results of this study suggest that testing is associated with a range of clinical covariates. However, an association was similarly identified with preoperative consultation, and significant variation between institutions exists across the jurisdiction.

### Association of anaesthetists guidelines: the use of blood components and their alternatives [^b7525a61]. Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Recommendations

Pre‐operative:
All patients should have their haemoglobin concentration measured before listing for major elective surgery.
Where blood transfusion is anticipated, this and alternatives to transfusion should be discussed with the patient before surgery, and their consent should be documented according to local protocols.

Minimising peri‐operative blood loss:
3 Management of anticoagulants in the peri‐operative period should balance the risk of bleeding with the risk of thrombosis.
4 The use of cell salvage and antifibrinolytics, such as tranexamic acid, is recommended in all patients who are bleeding, where blood loss > 500 mL (> 8 ml.kg⁻¹ in children weighing > 10 kg) is possible and/or in patients are unable to receive donor blood.
5 Minimise iatrogenic anaemia by managing blood sampling appropriately.

Recognition and management of major bleeding:
Early recognition of obstetric bleeding is essential and should be measured accumulatively, leading to a clear escalation plan of intervention and involvement of the multidisciplinary team.
Every institution should have a major haemorrhage protocol which is regularly audited and reviewed. They should be concise but targeted, and allow for immediate release and protocolised administration of blood components.
In an emergency, surgical implementation of damage/proximal control strategies may be required until haemorrhage control is achieved.
Group O red blood cells (RBCs) for transfusion should be readily available in the clinical area, in case haemorrhage is life‐threatening. Group‐specific RBCs should be made available by the laboratory as soon as possible after receiving correctly labelled samples and being informed of the emergency requirement for blood, and according to local laboratory protocols.
During major haemorrhage due to trauma, preference should be given to transfusing RBCs and fresh frozen plasma (FFP). Clear fluids (crystalloids) should be avoided unless there is profound hypotension and no imminent availability of blood components.
Blood components should be prescribed for children as a volume (ml.kg ‐1) rather than in units.
Patients who continue to bleed actively should be monitored by point‐of‐care and/or regular laboratory tests for coagulation, fibrinogen and platelet counts and/or function. A guide for transfusion should be: FFP if INR > 1.5; cryoprecipitate if fibrinogen < 1.5 g.l⁻¹ (< 2.0 g.l⁻¹ in obstetrics); and platelets if platelet count < 50 × 10⁹.l⁻¹ (< 75 × 10⁹.l⁻¹ in obstetrics).

Tested guidelines

The protocols guiding the perioperative techniques for blood management in our hospital, based on the published practice guidelines, include medications and measurements in the pre-, intra- and postoperative phase of a CABG surgery. In the following paragraphs the tested guidelines are reported. The selection of the guidelines that were tested was also based on the quality of the registration of the parameters.

Preoperative phase

In the preoperative phase we analyzed the guidelines about hemoglobin value (Hb) and prothrombin time, measured as International Normalized Ratio (INR), of the patients before undergoing the CABG procedure. The hospital guidelines state that the last INR needs to be measured maximum one day before the procedure. For the preoperative phase the guidelines of the hospital suggest:

The last measured Hb being above or equal than 11.3 g/dl;
The last INR value being measured 0 or 1 day before the surgery and being not higher than 2.

### Detection, evaluation, and management of preoperative anaemia in the elective orthopaedic surgical patient: NATA guidelines [^931975fc]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2011). Low credibility.

Previously undiagnosed anaemia is common in elective orthopaedic surgical patients and is associated with increased likelihood of blood transfusion and increased perioperative morbidity and mortality. A standardized approach for the detection, evaluation, and management of anaemia in this setting has been identified as an unmet medical need. A multidisciplinary panel of physicians was convened by the Network for Advancement of Transfusion Alternatives (NATA) with the aim of developing practice guidelines for the detection, evaluation, and management of preoperative anaemia in elective orthopaedic surgery. A systematic literature review and critical evaluation of the evidence was performed, and recommendations were formulated according to the method proposed by the Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group. We recommend that elective orthopaedic surgical patients have a haemoglobin (Hb) level determination 28 days before the scheduled surgical procedure if possible (Grade 1C). We suggest that the patient's target Hb before elective surgery be within the normal range, according to the World Health Organization criteria (Grade 2C). We recommend further laboratory testing to evaluate anaemia for nutritional deficiencies, chronic renal insufficiency, and/or chronic inflammatory disease (Grade 1C). We recommend that nutritional deficiencies be treated (Grade 1C). We suggest that erythropoiesis-stimulating agents be used for anaemic patients in whom nutritional deficiencies have been ruled out, corrected, or both (Grade 2A). Anaemia should be viewed as a serious and treatable medical condition, rather than simply an abnormal laboratory value. Implementation of anaemia management in the elective orthopaedic surgery setting will improve patient outcomes.

### Patient, hospital and environmental costs of unnecessary bloodwork: capturing the triple bottom line of inappropriate care in general surgery patients [^d3660fe2]. BMJ Open Quality (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

This study builds on our previous work establishing recommendations for appropriate laboratory testing in common and uncomplicated general surgery inpatients. By comparing actual clinical practices to these consensus-derived recommendations, we show that a majority of patients undergo unnecessary laboratory testing at considerable cost to the individual patient, the hospital and the environment.

This study captures the triple bottom line of unnecessary bloodwork including financial costs and environmental impacts, measured here by carbon costs. Estimating social costs within healthcare is complex due to the integrated psychological, physical and emotional determinants of health. Our study captures the social costs of over-investigation using elements of patient outcomes and experience, namely volume of blood loss and frequency of unnecessary phlebotomy. This approach is supported by recent literature using health impacts to represent the social cost of unnecessary vitamin D testing.

The prevalence of over-investigation in our patient population (76%) was in keeping with the literature. In medical and critical care populations, 50%–85% of tests have been found to be non-essentialwith providers underestimating the frequency of over-investigation. Breth-Petersen et al found that 76.5% of vitamin D testing in Australia was unnecessary, and in a surgical population, 95.6% of abnormal postoperative bloodwork in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty did not alter clinical management. The only prior study of over-investigation in general surgery patients involved surgical trainees self-reporting the frequency of unnecessary testing. Irrespective of training level, nearly 70% of residents acknowledged unnecessary testing, attributing this behaviour to hospital culture, lack of cost transparency and absence of laboratory stewardship role models. While we did not investigate the drivers of over-investigation, these factors have been consistently identified in the literature. Our study provides transparency around the prevalence of unnecessary testing and granular financial and environmental costs of these practices in general surgery patients within a teaching hospital.

### The ASH-ASPHO Choosing Wisely Campaign: 5 hematologic tests and treatments to question [^4e447588]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2021). High credibility.

Recommendation 1 — preoperative hemostatic testing in healthy children without a bleeding history states: "Avoid performing routine preoperative hemostatic testing (PT, aPTT) in an otherwise healthy child with no previous personal or family history of bleeding". Supporting rationale includes that "Rather than performing hemostatic testing on all preoperative pediatric patients, it is necessary to perform a thorough personal, family, and medication history relating to abnormal bleeding signs and/or symptoms", and that "Previous studies have shown that untargeted screening does not effectively identify those at risk of surgical bleeding". Typical tests are described: "Typical hemostatic tests ordered in preoperative screening include prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT)", and false positives are common: "Mild prolongations of the PT and aPTT are common in children… which do not result in excessive bleeding or increase the risk of perioperative bleeding". Resource and harm considerations are noted: "Cost analyses have revealed that hemostatic screening is not cost-effective in children undergoing tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy", and "delays resulting from abnormal hemostasis testing cause harm by inducing stress and anxiety… with increased costs resulting from superfluous subspecialty consultation and testing".

### Preoperative laboratory testing: general issues and considerations [^a8ce4991]. Anesthesiology Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

The challenge of preoperative laboratory testing has been increased during the past 20 years because now fewer than 30% of patients undergoing surgery are admitted to the hospital before the day of surgery. Even with the advent of formal preoperative systems in many institutions, it is believed that well over 50% of patients do not have a definitive preoperative visit with anesthesia staff before the day of surgery. Thus, anesthesia teams are dependent on other providers to provide appropriate data to best judge who is an appropriate candidate for anesthesia. This issue is becoming all the more difficult because the acuity of patients and complexity of procedures being managed on an outpatient or same day admission basis increases.

### Patient, hospital and environmental costs of unnecessary bloodwork: capturing the triple bottom line of inappropriate care in general surgery patients [^c3baf4f3]. BMJ Open Quality (2023). High credibility.

Conclusions

There is considerable overuse of laboratory investigations in uncomplicated acute care general surgery patients. This study highlights the role of laboratory stewardship as a central tenet of planetary healthcare. Eliminating healthcare activities that contribute no clinical value is a strategic target for decarbonising the health sector, with co-benefits of avoiding patient harm and accruing cost savings. We recommend that healthcare practitioners follow local or national guidelines such as Choosing Wisely recommendations and adopt thoughtful ordering practices guided by clinical judgement. This study also contributes environmental costs of laboratory tests that can be used in future studies and operationalises a triple bottom line approach to health services that should be embedded within quality improvement frameworks.

### Strategies to prevent blood loss and reduce transfusion in emergency general surgery, WSES-AAST consensus paper [^7dc0b5b7]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Globally, it is estimated that there are 313 million surgical procedures performed annually. Of which, an estimated 7.7% of these case [4.2 million people] will die within the first 30 days after surgery. Whilst there is no definitive consensus data on postoperative morbidity, this is expected to be much higher.

Emergency general surgeons often provide care to severely ill patients requiring surgical interventions and of intensive physiological support. While various patients and operative factors are at play in emergency general surgery, one of the primary drivers of morbidity and mortality is perioperative bleeding. This can manifest preoperatively in hemodynamically unstable trauma patients for example, or intraoperatively in complex emergency surgical procedures or post-operatively in any surgical patient. Bleeding contributes to significant morbidity, mortality and consumption of resources. Very often in supporting physiology of the patients' blood transfusions are applied liberally. Although helpful in some scenarios, large volume blood transfusions can also have detrimental effects. Transfusion can have a negative impact on clinical outcomes, economics, and on resource allocation. Moreover, considering the importance of the physician–patient relationship, it is necessary to respect the patient's will and concerns and to understand and appropriately address any special patient's needs that arise. Patient autonomy must be completely respected by all those providing healthcare while providing high-quality, effective, and safe treatment. In general, when addressing life threatening haemorrhage, blood transfusion can become an essential part of overall resuscitation. However, under all circumstances, indications for blood transfusion must be accurately evaluated. When patients decline blood transfusions, regardless of the reason, surgeons should aim to provide optimal care and respect and accommodate each patient's values and target the best outcome possible given the patient's desires and his/her clinical condition. All those points should be accurately discussed and agreed with the patient in an honest and ethical manner. In elective surgery, there are now many evidence that support the implementation of strategies to reduce use of blood in peri-operative period. The 3 pillars of Patient Blood Management (PBM) was proposed for pre-, intra- and post-operative period: optimize erythropoiesis, minimize blood loss and bleeding, optimize physiological tolerance to anemia. In an emergency setting, only a part of these recommendations can be maintained, because pre-operative period is very short and there is no time to prepare patient (Table 1).

### Surgical management of pelvic floor disorders and the utility of preoperative labs [^082f063f]. International Urogynecology Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Three out of 4 women undergoing surgery for pelvic floor disorders had preoperative labs performed. Almost two-thirds of women had a CBC drawn and half of the study cohort had a T&S and BMP or CMP completed. Clinically meaningful laboratory abnormalities were rarely discovered prior to surgery. Despite detection of laboratory abnormalities, no preoperative adjustments were made to address the abnormalities, and no surgeries were cancelled or postponed. Our study reinforces the low utility of performing preoperative laboratory assessment in women undergoing surgery for pelvic floor disorders. Current hospital policies and procedures need to be re-evaluated to reflect current national guidelines of selective testing.

Current ASA guidelines for pre-anesthesia evaluation recommend against routine preoperative laboratory assessment. At this institution, the primary care or anesthesia teams order these laboratory tests for medical clearance, and these clinicians are encouraged to evaluate patient characteristics and co-morbidities to determine specific indications for preoperative laboratory testing. Type and invasiveness of the procedure and specific medical co-morbidities (anemia, hematological disorder, renal disorder, liver dysfunction, etc.) can help to guide the decision to perform preoperative laboratory assessment that would provide valuable information to aid in determining the patient's risk of a perioperative adverse event or guide anesthesia management. No explicit parameters for ordering preoperative tests have been identified. Instead, the Anesthesia Task Force recommends individualized testing based on specific clinical characteristics obtained from patient medical records, interviews, physical examination, and the type and invasiveness of the planned procedure. Routine preoperative labs, defined by the absence of clinical indication or purpose, do not provide a significant contribution to a patient's preoperative management and instead is associated with low patient satisfaction, increased laboratory costs, and inappropriate waste of laboratory resources and time. Women undergoing surgery for pelvic floor disorders are often healthy, with low rates of significant medical co-morbidities. Surgical management of pelvic floor disorders are also considered low risk of perioperative adverse events or blood transfusions. Despite this, 3 out of 4 women underwent preoperative laboratory assessment in our study and clinically meaningful lab abnormalities were rarely discovered. Even if meaningful results were found, no preoperative interventions or surgical cancellations or postponements were made because of these abnormalities. Our findings are consistent with those of previous literature that highlights the low utility of routine preoperative testing within this patient population, emphasizing the need for updated hospital policies and practices.

### Pre-interventional haemostatic assessment: guidelines from the French society of anaesthesia and intensive care [^4960ec1c]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2013). Low credibility.

Recently the French Society of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care (Société Française d'Anesthésie et de Réanimation [SFAR]) issued recommendations for the prescription of routine preoperative testing before a surgical or non-surgical procedure, requiring any type of anaesthesia. Thirty clinical specialists performed a systematic analysis of the literature, and recommendations were then developed using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system. One part of these guidelines is dedicated to haemostatic assessment. The goal of pre-anaesthetic screening for congenital or acquired haemostatic disorders is to prevent perioperative haemorrhagic complications through appropriate medical and surgical management. Preoperative assessment of bleeding risk requires a detailed patient interview to determine any personal or family history of haemorrhagic diathesis, and a physical examination is necessary in order to detect signs of coagulopathy. Laboratory investigation of haemostasis should be prescribed, not systematically, but depending on clinical evaluation and patient history. Standard tests (prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, platelet count) have a low positive predictive value for bleeding risk in the general population. Patients with no history of haemorrhagic diathesis and no conditions liable to interfere with haemostasis should not undergo pre-interventional haemostasis testing. Conversely, the existence of a positive history or a disease that could interfere with haemostasis should be an indication for clinically appropriate testing.

Using the French Hospital Discharge Database and National Health Insurance Information system, tests performed during the 30days before surgery were analysed for two situations: (1) standard laboratory coagulation tests and ABO blood typing in children able to walk and scheduled for tonsillectomy/adenoidectomy; and (2) ABO blood typing in adults before laparoscopic cholecystectomy, thyroidectomy, lumbar discectomy or breast surgery. Guidelines do not recommend any preoperative tests in these settings.

Results

Between 2013 and 2015, a coagulation test was performed in 49% of the 241017 children who underwent tonsillectomy and 39% of the 133790 children who underwent adenoidectomy. A similar pattern was observed for ABO blood typing although re-operation rates for bleeding on the first postoperative day were very low (0.12–0.31% for tonsillectomy and 0.01–0.02% for adenoidectomy). Between 2012 and 2015, ABO blood typing was performed in 32–45% of the 1114082 patients who underwent one of the four selected procedures. The transfusion rate was very low (0.02–0.31%). The mean cost for the four procedures over the 4yr period was €5310000 (sd €325000).

Conclusions

Standard laboratory coagulation tests and ABO blood typing are still routinely prescribed before surgery and anaesthesia despite current guidelines. This over-prescription represents a high and unnecessary cost, and should therefore be addressed.

### Preoperative assessment of risk factors [^8ee1832b]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Hemostasis is essential during endoscopic sinus and skull base surgery. Patients must be adequately assessed for bleeding risk to appropriately consent to surgery. The patient and the surgeon must be aware of the individual bleeding risk for a given procedure. A thorough history and physical examination is the best screening methodology available to determine whether a patient requires further hematologic work-up. Included in this assessment should be any medications and herbals that the patient consumes. This ensures a safe evaluation of the patient, streamlines appropriate consultation and testing when necessary, and confers accurate surgical risk assessment.

### Preoperative investigation practices for elective surgical patients: clinical audit [^c1caf890]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Preoperative investigations (PI) are tests performed prior to surgery to improve patient outcomes through planning, stratification, optimization, and perioperative management. The use of laboratory tests has long been an element of the preoperative evaluation of a patient's fitness for anesthesia and surgery. PI for patients scheduled for elective surgery typically includes a complete blood count (CBC), assessments of organ function, blood sugar level, urine analysis, chest radiography (CXR), and an electrocardiogram (ECG).

Preoperative investigations can be categorized as either routine or indicated. According to the American Society of Anesthesiologists, routine preoperative tests are those performed without a specific clinical reason or purpose to detect a disease or disorder in a patient who shows no symptoms. Indicated tests are performed in response to a specific clinical need, such as confirming a diagnosis, evaluating the severity and advancement of a disease, or assessing the effectiveness of medication.

Preoperative tests are valuable when they offer information beyond what can be gathered solely from a patient's medical history and physical examination. Apart from assessing a patient's suitability for surgery and anesthesia, PI plays a role in evaluating the advancement and severity of illnesses, anticipating postoperative complications, balancing the risks and advantages of surgery, and facilitating adjustments to the patient's clinical treatment as necessary. Furthermore, PI can establish a baseline for future comparison, particularly when interpreting possibly abnormal postoperative test findings that may be challenging to understand independently.

Preoperative testing practices exhibit significant variability across hospitals, and even within the same hospital, clinicians may adopt diverse approaches to PI requests. Despite their historical importance in pre-anesthetic assessment, numerous scientific studies in recent years have suggested that routinely ordering preoperative tests for generally healthy patients often offers limited value in identifying illnesses or influencing anesthetic care or outcomes. A significant portion of routinely conducted investigations, which can be expensive, may result in false-positive or borderline findings, prompting the need for further tests. This could impose psychological and financial difficulties, as well as delays or cancellations of surgery, potentially heightening the risks of morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, it can lead to inefficient resource allocation and an increased workload for laboratories, potentially compromising the quality of patient care.

### Surgical management of pelvic floor disorders and the utility of preoperative labs [^4a93a692]. International Urogynecology Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Prior literature has emphasized the limited clinical utility of routine preoperative laboratory assessment in women undergoing surgery for pelvic floor disorders. However, our study emphasizes that routine preoperative laboratory assessment continues to persist in surgical practice. Three-quarters of our cohort were undergoing at least one preoperative lab; however, nearly half had no significant medical co-morbidities and the most common comorbidity was hypertension. The cohort included women with a history of liver disease, kidney disease, and anemia, yet diabetes mellitus was the only co-morbidity that was associated with preoperative lab collection. Although preexisting diabetes may warrant presurgical blood tests, preoperative hemoglobin A1C is recommended to provide more useful insights into glucose control and risk of perioperative adverse events, not T&S, CBC, or CMP/BMP. Metabolic panels can provide immediate blood glucose levels and acidosis status, but these findings are rarely helpful for surgical planning outside of poorly controlled diabetics. Invasiveness of the procedure was significantly associated with preoperative laboratory assessment, which is consistent with current national guidelines. Women undergoing major procedures were more likely to have preoperative labs performed than women undergoing minor procedures. However, when identifying specific surgeries, the outcomes were not consistent that women undergoing all major procedures were more likely to have preoperative laboratory testing. Although level of invasiveness is consistent with current preoperative test guidelines, major surgery categorization alone is not sufficient to warrant preoperative laboratory assessments.

Hysterectomies are commonly performed at the time of reconstructive pelvic surgery for pelvic organ prolapse. Prior to the implementation of minimally invasive techniques, open hysterectomy was associated with greater blood loss and a higher risk of perioperative blood transfusion. Perioperative transfusion risk for women undergoing surgery for pelvic floor disorders is less than 1% and previous studies have found that an abdominal approach was associated with a 5.5 times higher odds of receiving a perioperative blood transfusion compared with vaginal approach. The shift toward minimally invasive surgical techniques in women undergoing major urogynecological procedures (i.e. hysterectomy, apical suspension) has significantly reduced perioperative transfusion risk. Therefore, we argue that even patients undergoing "major" surgical procedures for pelvic floor disorders do not qualify for preoperative laboratory assessment without other patient factors that increase the risk of perioperative adverse events.

### An international consensus statement on the management of postoperative anaemia after major surgical procedures [^6aeb1582]. Anaesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

Why was this consensus statement developed?

The concept 'patient blood management' (PBM) is defined as " the timely application of evidence‐based medical and surgical concepts designed to manage anaemia, optimise haemostasis and minimise blood loss in order to improve patient outcomes after surgery "' 1. Patient blood management has been shown to reduce transfusion, healthcare costs and morbidity and mortality 2. Treatment of pre‐operative anaemia and isolated iron deficiency are crucial measures for PBM 3, 4. However, detection and early treatment of pre‐operative anaemia and iron deficiency is an accepted logistical challenge and, as a consequence, some patients may undergo surgery without the chance to address their anaemia 3. In addition, there has been increased emphasis on accelerated discharge after surgery and the use of restrictive transfusion thresholds in order to improve outcomes and reduce transfusion requirements, which may have led to overlooking potential opportunities to optimise anaemic patients and improve their functional recovery 5, 6. Therefore, an additional focus on the early detection and treatment of postoperative iron deficiency and anaemia is a novel and complementary measure within the concept of PBM; this allows the attending physician to target patients who lost significant red cell mass during surgery and may require specific attention postoperatively or following discharge 7.

### Routine preoperative laboratory tests for elective surgery… [^dd1eb513]. JAMA Network (2017). Excellent credibility.

Preoperative evaluation, often including laboratory testing, is used to assess a patient's risk for perioperative adverse events, characterize the current status of systemic disease, and identify any unrecognized risk factors or disease that may increase risk of complications. Preoperative testing may lead to significant harms and costs, particularly when false-positive or incidental findings are uncovered. 1 Testing often does not significantly change management in relatively healthy patients. 2 There is significant variability in clinical practice regarding "routine" preoperative testing for elective surgery in healthy and comorbid populations. This guideline addresses the use of selected and specific common laboratory tests for nonpregnant adults undergoing elective surgery. Martin SK, Cifu AS. Routine Preoperative Laboratory Tests for Elective Surgery. JAMA. 2017; 318: 567–568.

### Preoperative investigation practices for elective surgical patients: clinical audit [^cb957f3a]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Similarly, Dzankic et al. concluded that routine preoperative testing for hemoglobin, creatinine, glucose, and electrolytes may not be indicated in geriatric patients after conducting a prospective cohort study that evaluated the prevalence and predictive value of abnormal preoperative laboratory tests in 544 patients aged 70 years old undergoing non-cardiac surgery. In a prospective study involving 400 patients that aimed to assess the effectiveness of preoperative investigations in identifying high-risk groups for complications, only 16% of the results showed abnormalities. However, of these abnormal results, only 0.013% prompted a change in perioperative management.

Instead, conducting a detailed patient medical history and physical examination is the most efficient way to detect abnormalities. Following this, only a few specifically chosen tests are administered, taking into account the patient's condition, the complexity of the planned surgery, and the likelihood of blood loss. A selected testing strategy reduces costs without sacrificing surgical safety or the quality of treatment.

Nowadays, there is a greater emphasis on low-value healthcare services. Nowadays, when preoperative laboratory investigations are correlated with the patients' histories and physical examinations, they are found to be beneficial and cost-effective, and there is a greater emphasis on low-value healthcare services. Several organizations, including the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) and the Canadian Anesthesiologists' Society (CAS), have issued guidelines to standardize testing and reduce costs. The purpose of this audit was to identify disparities between the preoperative investigation procedures followed at Debre Tabor Comprehensive and Specialized Referral Hospital (DTCSH) and the latest preoperative investigation guidelines provided by NICE. Secondly, our aim was to identify commonly ordered routine tests and assess the frequency of abnormal findings.

### Detection, evaluation, and management of preoperative anaemia in the elective orthopaedic surgical patient: NATA guidelines [^a3f5c632]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2011). Low credibility.

The largest randomized trial to evaluate transfusion triggers to date is in 838 intensive care patients, including those undergoing surgery. Patients were randomized either to a restrictive transfusion strategy in which patients received transfusions to keep Hb between 7 and 9 g dL⁻¹ or a liberal strategy with Hb levels maintained between 10 and 12 g dL⁻¹. The 30-day mortality in the two groups was not different, 18.7% and 23.3%, respectively (P = 0.11). The rate of myocardial infarction was significantly lower in the restrictive group, 0.7% vs 2.9% (P = 0.02), as was pulmonary oedema, 5.3% vs 10.7% (P = 0.02).

From these studies, it would appear that for patients without CVD, the tolerance for postoperative anaemia is high. In patients with CVD, the tolerance to anaemia is lower and these patients benefit particularly from anaemia management. Otherwise, a restrictive transfusion policy seems equivalent to a liberal policy in terms of mortality, morbidity, and postoperative mobilization. The most effective strategy to avoid postoperative anaemia and transfusion therapy is to identify and correct preoperative anaemia whenever possible.

Because preoperative anaemia in patients undergoing elective orthopaedic surgery is associated with increased likelihood of blood transfusion and increased perioperative morbidity and mortality, a standardized approach for the detection, evaluation, and management of anaemia in this setting has been identified as an unmet medical need. – Reviews have suggested laboratory evaluations of anaemia based on traditional approaches such as red cell size (mean corpuscular volume) and serum ferritin levels. However, recent advances in the molecular biology of iron transport in clinical settings of chronic disease/inflammation now allow more targeted approaches to anaemia evaluation centred on iron-restricted erythropoiesis and proactive management with iron therapy.

### Systematic criteria for type and screen based on procedure's probability of erythrocyte transfusion [^5c4c08ca]. Anesthesiology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

At many hospitals, the type and screen decision is guided by the hospital's maximum surgical blood order schedule, a document that includes for each scheduled (elective) surgical procedure a recommendation of whether a preoperative type and screen be performed. There is substantial heterogeneity in the scientific literature for how that decision should be made.

Methods

Anesthesia information management system data were retrieved from the 160,207 scheduled noncardiac cases in adults of 1,253 procedures at a hospital.

Results

Neither assuming a Poisson distribution of mean erythrocyte units transfused, nor grouping rare procedures into larger groups based on their anesthesia Current Procedural Terminology code, was reliable. In contrast, procedures could be defined to have minimal estimated blood loss (less than 50 ml) based on low incidence of transfusion and low incidence of the hemoglobin being checked preoperatively. Among these procedures, when the lower 95% confidence limit for erythrocyte transfusion was less than 5%, type and screen was shown to be unnecessary. The method was useful based on including multiple differences from the hospital's maximum surgical blood order schedule and clinicians' test ordering (greater than or equal to 29% fewer type and screen). Results were the same with a Bayesian random effects model.

Conclusions

We validated a method to determine procedures on the maximum surgical blood order schedule for which type and screen was not indicated using the estimated blood losses and incidences of transfusion.
