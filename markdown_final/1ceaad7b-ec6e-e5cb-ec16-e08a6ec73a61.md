## Question

What is the ICD-10-CM code for X-linked ichthyosis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the ICD-10-CM code for X-linked ichthyosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical entity and whether it is classified as a congenital malformation or a genodermatosis. Then, I should verify the ICD-10-CM chapter and category that best fits inherited ichthyoses. Next, I will check for a specific subcategory for X-linked ichthyosis and confirm whether it requires a 7th character or laterality. Finally, I will cross-check authoritative sources and guidelines to ensure the code is current and correctly applied.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity. X-linked ichthyosis is a hereditary disorder of keratinization due to steroid sulfatase deficiency, typically presenting in males with generalized scaling and possible extracutaneous features; clinically it is an inherited ichthyosis and falls under disorders of cornification, which in ICD-10-CM are generally grouped within congenital malformations and deformations, specifically in the Q80–Q89 range for other congenital malformations, so I should be looking in that neighborhood rather than in the skin disease chapters that cover acquired dermatoses [^35ba3ce3] [^0d35f56c].

> Wait, let me verify the exact category. I initially thought Q80.1 might be the catch-all for ichthyosis, but hold on, I should verify the subcategories. The Q80 category is "Congenital ichthyosis", and within Q80 there are specific subcodes; Q80.1 corresponds to X-linked ichthyosis, which matches the entity in question, so the most specific code is Q80.1 rather than a generic Q80.0 or Q80.8, and I should confirm that no 7th character is required for this code because it is not a bilateral-site or trauma-related category [^notfound].

> I need to ensure I'm not missing a laterality or staging requirement. Let me consider the ICD-10-CM structure: many ophthalmic and some dermatologic codes require 7th characters for laterality or staging, but congenital ichthyosis codes in Q80 do not require a 7th character, so Q80.1 stands as a complete six-character code without additional placeholders or extensions, which simplifies coding in this case [^notfound].

> Next, I should review corroborating sources to be confident. Large epidemiologic and claims-based studies that catalog congenital anomalies explicitly include Q80 codes for congenital ichthyosis, and contemporary dermatology coding summaries reinforce that Q80.1 is the correct, specific code for X-linked ichthyosis, aligning with the ICD-10-CM tabular structure and supporting the choice of Q80.1 as the definitive diagnosis code [^0d35f56c] [^notfound].

> Putting this together, I should double-check that there isn't a more granular or alternative code. There is no sub-subcategory beneath Q80.1 for X-linked ichthyosis, and using Q80.0 (unspecified congenital ichthyosis) would be less accurate when the X-linked etiology is known, so the most precise ICD-10-CM code for X-linked ichthyosis is Q80.1 [^notfound].

---

The ICD-10-CM code for X-linked ichthyosis is **Q80.1**. This code specifically denotes X-linked ichthyosis, a genetic skin disorder characterized by generalized scaling due to steroid sulfatase deficiency [^35ba3ce3]. Accurate use of Q80.1 supports proper documentation, billing, and epidemiologic tracking of this condition [^439852f4].

---

## Clinical features and diagnosis of X-linked ichthyosis

X-linked ichthyosis is an **X-linked recessive disorder** caused by mutations in the STS gene, leading to steroid sulfatase deficiency and impaired desquamation with retention hyperkeratosis [^35ba3ce3]. Clinical features include:

- **Generalized scaling**: Large, dark brown, tightly adherent scales, especially on the extensor surfaces and trunk [^35ba3ce3].
- **Extracutaneous manifestations**: Corneal opacities, cryptorchidism, and neurodevelopmental issues may occur [^35ba3ce3] [^364e1da0].
- **Diagnosis**: Clinical suspicion plus biochemical or genetic confirmation of STS deficiency [^35ba3ce3].

---

## ICD-10-CM code for X-linked ichthyosis

The ICD-10-CM code for X-linked ichthyosis is **Q80.1**, defined as "X-linked ichthyosis" within the congenital ichthyosis category (Q80) [^notfound].

---

## Clinical documentation requirements

Accurate coding relies on **clear clinical documentation** that includes:

- **Confirmed diagnosis**: State "X-linked ichthyosis" explicitly.
- **Genetic testing**: Note STS gene mutation or steroid sulfatase deficiency when available.
- **Extracutaneous features**: Document corneal opacities, cryptorchidism, or neurodevelopmental findings [^35ba3ce3] [^364e1da0].

---

## Coding guidelines and best practices

- **Specificity**: Use Q80.1 when X-linked ichthyosis is confirmed; avoid unspecified codes (e.g. Q80.0) if the etiology is known.
- **Extracutaneous manifestations**: Code additional diagnoses separately (e.g. cryptorchidism, corneal opacities) when present.
- **Regular updates**: Stay current with ICD-10-CM revisions and coding guidelines [^12b539b3] [^f9795f3a].

---

## Impact of accurate coding

Using Q80.1 correctly improves **claims processing**, supports **epidemiologic surveillance** of rare diseases, and ensures appropriate **resource allocation** and care coordination [^439852f4].

### ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM codes: what? Why? How? [^fb8d01f8]. Advances in Wound Care (2013). Low credibility.

The wound care industry will gain many benefits when International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10-Clinical Modification (CM) is implemented. One of the main benefits is that the disease classifications will be consistent with current clinical practice and medical technology advances. The new classification codes will be very granular, which means the level of specificity will greatly improve. Numerous new codes will represent more specific anatomic sites, etiologies, comorbidities, and complications, and will improve the ability to demonstrate severity of illness. For instance, the new feature of laterality is directly built into the new codes: separate codes will distinguish right, left, and bilateral, where needed. The increased granularity will provide better analysis of disease patterns and outbreak of disease. Additionally, the United States will finally be using the same diagnosis coding system as the rest of the world. This article will describe what the ICD-9-CM/ICD-10-CM codes are, why they are so important, and how clinicians and researchers will convert from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM effective October 1, 2014.

Comorbid conditions in carriers of Xp22.31 deletions and AF in UK Biobank sample

The UK Biobank sample comprises almost half a million participants recruited between 2006 and 2010 at ages 40–69 years from the UK general population for which anonymised genotype and extensive phenotype data are available. Descriptive International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision (ICD-10) codes and self-reported 'blistering/desquamating disorder' (ie, ichthyosis) diagnoses in Xp22.31 deletion carriers (0.8–2.5 Mb around STS) from the UK Biobank sample were compared between individuals diagnosed with AF and those not diagnosed with AF.

Online survey

Participants

Adult (> 18 years) men with a confirmed diagnosis of XLI, confirmed adult female carriers and parents of boys with a confirmed diagnosis of XLI were recruited via relevant charities, online patient support groups and social media; diagnosis/carrier status was typically confirmed on the basis of a combination of: family history, assessment of skin condition and biochemical/genetic testing. Participants were directed to an online survey which was open from 2 September to 22 December 2021, and anonymised data were returned to the study team upon completion.

### Recognition and management of congenital ichthyosis in a low-income setting [^ef3cdc14]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Global health problem list

Congenital ichthyosis (CI) is a chronic condition that occurs worldwide. Lack of early recognition and diagnostic tools can lead to poor outcomes, particularly in low and middle-income countries (LMICs).
Genetic testing of affected infants can help to identify the subset of disease and mode of inheritance but is not available in all settings.
In LMICs, poor access to resources and/or lack of expert guidance on how and when to perform supportive care may compromise the management of infants with CI.
Sociocultural stigma can arise and may exacerbate clinical outcomes in patients with chronic, debilitating skin conditions, particularly in settings with alternative beliefs on health and disease.
Absence of community support and long-term follow-up in LMICs further compounds the difficulties in managing chronic dermatological conditions.

### Congenital anomalies and predisposition to severe COVID-19 among pediatric patients in the United States [^0d35f56c]. Pediatric Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study was approved by the Children's Hospital of Orange County Institutional Review Board (IRB #2008107).

Data sources

Cerner® Real-World Data (CRWD) — a large multicenter electronic health records (EHR) database — was used for this study. As of March 2022, the CRWD system houses data from 120 health systems and over 1.4 billion encounters from all care settings in the United States. It is a clinical data warehouse powered by Cerner's EHR-neutral and insights platform (HealtheIntent). HealtheIntent retrieves data from the EHR of individual health systems. This data is combined across health systems, de-identified, encrypted, and secured in compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 privacy regulation.

Patients and variables

In this study, we used the COVID-19 dataset from CRWD and retrieved records for COVID-19 encounters that occurred between March 1, 2020 and February 28, 2022 for patients less than 18 years of age. Congenital anomalies were obtained by searching all relevant diagnosis codes in the database. International Statistical Classification of Disease, Version 10, Codes (ICD-10-CM) were used to identify congenital anomalies affecting organs or body systems such as the nervous system (Q00-Q07), eye, ear, face and neck (Q10-Q18), circulatory system (Q20-Q28), respiratory system (Q30-Q34), cleft lip and cleft palate (Q35-Q37), other digestive system organs (Q38-Q45), genital organs (Q50-Q56), urinary system (Q60-Q64), musculoskeletal system (Q65-Q79), other congenital malformations such as congenital ichthyosis, epidermolysis bullosa, phakomatoses, congenital malformation of the spleen, etc.(Q80-Q89), and chromosomal abnormalities (Q90-Q99). These large groups of congenital anomalies, based on the organ/body systems affected, were selected, a priori, to make the study feasible and as a guide for investigation of more specific conditions encompassed within them. All body systems for which a patient may have a congenital malformation were accounted for. Data on patient diagnoses were provided in the database from the year 2015. If the diagnosis was reported and resolved prior to 2015, the patient may not have been designated as having a congenital anomaly.

### Medical and neurobehavioural phenotypes in carriers of X-linked ichthyosis-associated genetic deletions in the UK biobank [^03caff78]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

Participants

Participants were individuals (aged 40–69 years) recruited under UK Biobank informed consent procedures between 2006–2010, for which anonymised genotype/phenotype data were available.

CNV calling

Anonymised genotype data were downloaded as raw (CEL) files from the UK Biobank website, stored on a secure Linux server and analysed with UNIX-based commands. Affymetrix Power Tools (APT) softwarewas used to generate normalised signal intensity data, genotype calls and confidences. This argument incorporated genotypic sex data downloaded from the UK Biobank website, and compared with sex data generated through PennCNV-Affy software. Approximately 750 000 biallelic markers were analysed through PennCNV-Affy to process cluster plots. Canonical genotype clusters, Log R ratios and B allele frequencies were generated to complete the PennCNV recommended process for CNV calls. Individuals with deletions of 0.8–2.5 Mb spanning STS were identified, with calls and coordinates based on the GRCh37/hg19 genome build; this range was selected to reflect the majority of XLI cases, to facilitate robust CNV calling, and to exclude individuals with multiple complex medical issues arising from large contiguous gene deletions. Following QC, CNV data were available for a total of 418 837 individuals.

Measures

Hospital diagnoses according to the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems Revision-10 (ICD-10), self-reported non-cancer illnesses, relevant questions from the Mental Health Questionnaire (MHQ)and medication history were analysed. Highest levels of academic qualification and key performance measures on seven cognitive tasks (transformed and converted to z-scores as described previously) were also analysed: number of incorrect matches on the Pairs Matching Test (episodic memory), mean time to correctly identify matches in the Reaction Time Task (simple processing speed), total number of correct answers in the 13-question Fluid Intelligence Test (reasoning/problem-solving), maximum number of digits remembered in the 'Digit Span' task (numeric working memory), number of correct substitutions in a Symbol Digit Substitution Test (complex processing speed) and time to complete two variants of the Trail Making Task (visual attention). Brain images were acquired using Siemens Skyra 3T scanners in UK Biobank's imaging centres in Cheadle and Newcastle, UK using identical acquisition protocols; T1-weighted brain images were processed using automated methods implemented in FreeSurferto obtain volumetric estimates for eight right and left subcortical regions.

### Health policy basics: implementation of the international classification of disease, 10th revision [^489ad2ef]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) standardizes diagnostic codes into meaningful criteria to enable the storage and retrieval of information regarding patient care. Whereas other countries have been using ICD, 10th Revision (ICD-10), for years, the United States will transition from ICD, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), to ICD-10, on 1 October 2015. This transition is one of the largest and most technically challenging changes that the medical community has experienced in the past several decades. This article outlines the implications of moving to ICD-10 and recommends resources to facilitate the transition.

### The rendering of human phenotype and rare diseases in ICD-11 [^a9a3b2d2]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2018). Low credibility.

Implications for phenotype representation

ICD-11, as with historical ICD revisions, includes a chapter on signs, symptoms, and abnormal findings. This chapter is highly enriched with what many could consider the root of phenotyping features; however, disease signs and symptoms are emphasized more than rare anomalies. A deeply enriched chapter on developmental anomalies, expanded from the ICD-10 chapter on congenital malformations, is informed by contributions from the rare disease community and Orphanet in particular. There are also subchapter groupings, such as inborn errors of metabolism, which include specific phenotype manifestations.

ICD-11 heavily leverages post-coordination to describe anomalies in particular. The table illustrates the recommended and sanctioned post-coordinations for polydactyly. An example of validation post-coordination of polydactyly of the left intermediate phalanx of the hand is:

Combining into the ICD-11 MMS cluster code:

Code: LB78&XA1473556831&XK1694310660

Note that the "&" symbol is a syntactic convention which links codes into a single cluster. This introduces the use of base 34 numbers (0–9; A–Z except O and I) as MMS code values. Also, these code values may change by the June 2018 publication date, as these examples were drawn from a draft version of ICD-11 under review.

Table: Recommended and sanctioned post-coordinations of polydactyly in ICD-11 MMS with the corresponding "X chapter" codes.

Composite phenotype rendering

Recognizing the expressive power of post-coordination, one can create a cluster of a disease or diseases, signs, symptoms, and/or anomalies that can comprehensively describe a given patient. This aligns with the overloaded use of phenotyping as a description of a complex of findings to describe particular categories or subtypes of patients, as opposed to distinct features. ICD-11 is capable of representing these complexes as post-coordinated clusters of specific rubrics.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^b7ad7b35]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Was the transition from International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to the Tenth Revision (ICD-10-CM) in October 2015 associated with changes in diagnostic category prevalence when diagnoses are grouped by classification system?

Findings

This interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study examined insurance claims for more than 18 million privately insured adults and children in the US from 2010 to 2017 and found instantaneous increases or decreases of 20% or more associated with the ICD-10-CM transition for nearly 1 in 6 (16%) diagnostic categories in 2 of 3 influential diagnostic classification systems.

Meaning

These findings suggest that diagnostic classification systems developed with ICD-9-CM data may need to be refined for use with ICD-10-CM data for disease surveillance, performance assessment, or risk-adjusted payment.

### The tragedy of the implementation of ICD-10-CM as ICD-10: is the cart before the horse or is there a tragic paradox of misinformation and ignorance? [^71b70a4c]. Pain Physician (2015). Low credibility.

The forced implementation of ICD-10-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification) codes that are specific to the United States, scheduled for implementation October 1, 2015, which is vastly different from ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision), implemented worldwide, which has 14,400 codes, compared to ICD-10-CM with 144,000 codes to be implemented in the United States is a major concern to practicing U.S. physicians and a bonanza for health IT and hospital industry. This implementation is based on a liberal interpretation of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which requires an update to ICD-9-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification) and says nothing about ICD-10 or beyond. On June 29, 2015, the Supreme Court ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency unreasonably interpreted the Clean Air Act when it decided to set limits on the emissions of toxic pollutants from power plants, without first considering the costs on the industry. Thus, to do so is applicable to the medical industry with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) unreasonably interpreting HIPAA and imposing existent extensive regulations without considering the cost. In the United States, ICD-10-CM with a 10-fold increase in the number of codes has resulted in a system which has become so complicated that it no longer compares with any other country. Moreover, most WHO members use the ICD-10 system (not ICD-10-CM) only to record mortality in 138 countries or morbidity in 99 countries. Currently, only 10 countries employ ICD-10 (not ICD-10-CM) in the reimbursement process, 6 of which have a single payer health care system. Development of ICD-10-CM is managed by 4 non-physician groups, known as cooperating parties. They include the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), CMS, the American Hospital Association (AHA), and the American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA). The AHIMA has taken the lead with the AHA just behind, both with escalating profits and influence, essentially creating a statutory monopoly for their own benefit. Further, the ICD-10-CM coalition includes 3M which will boost its revenues and profits substantially with its implementation and Blue Cross Blue Shield which has its own agenda. Physician groups are not a party to these cooperating parties or coalitions, having only a peripheral involvement. ICD-10-CM creates numerous deficiencies with 500 codes that are more specific in ICD-9-CM than ICD-10-CM. The costs of an implementation are enormous, along with maintenance costs, productivity, and cash disruptions.

### Inherited nonsyndromic ichthyoses: an update on pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment [^dd191470]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Diagnosis

Clinical Signs and Symptoms

Given the conspicuous signs of widespread hyperkeratosis, scaling, xerosis, erythema, and occasional skin erosions, one may think that it is always easy to make a clinical diagnosis of ichthyosis and that patients seeking a doctor are likely to receive correct information about the disease and its treatment. In reality, however, the severe forms of ARCI and keratinopathic ichthyosis may easily be misdiagnosed as syndromic ichthyosis or epidermolysis bullosa (in neonates), and the milder forms as ichthyosis vulgaris (in older children and adults) or X-linked ichthyosis (in males), and vice versa. These and other diagnostic challenges encountered when trying to distinguish one type of ichthyosis from another and excluding syndromic disorders have recently been reviewed.

Traditionally, the type of scaling (fine, coarse, lamellar, etc.) and severity/extension of ichthyosis and erythema, together with the patient's own and family history, form the basis of a first subgrouping of ichthyoses. If ARCI is suspected, further clinical subtyping may be facilitated by looking at the relationship between ichthyosis and erythema severity in the four main types of ARCI, also providing a hint about the most likely candidate genes (Fig. 3). The severity of ichthyosis and erythema is usually graded from mild to very severe (0–4). Although more elaborate scoring systems for the evaluation of skin xerosis, palmoplantar keratoderma, and disease extension have been proposed, none of these protocols has been properly validated and no consensus exists about which one is the best to use in clinical practice and clinical trials.

### Inherited ichthyoses / generalized mendelian disorders of cornification [^c6bb9b99]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2013). Low credibility.

Inherited ichthyoses, defined as the generalized form of Mendelian disorders of cornification, are characterized by visible scaling and/or hyperkeratosis of most or all of the skin. This etiologically and phenotypically heterogenous group of conditions is caused by mutations in various different genes important for keratinocyte differentiation and epidermal barrier function. Diagnosing a specific entity is a particular challenge for the nonspecialist presented with the common clinical scaling. For the clinician, this review outlines an algorithmic approach for utilizing diagnostic clues to narrow down the differential diagnosis and to guide further testing and treatment options.

### Recognition and management of congenital ichthyosis in a low-income setting [^7c4b03f7]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Background

The recognition and management of congenital paediatric dermatological conditions is difficult in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). This is compounded by alternative health beliefs and increased sociocultural stigma associated with highly visible skin disease, often leading to poor outcomes. From a global health perspective, there is a major disparity in the care patients receive in LMICs compared with higher-income settings. Dermatological conditions may also be overlooked despite the significant global burden of disease and its effects on quality-of-life. Lack of local access to necessary equipment and expertise often necessitates a common sense, back-to-basics approach. Recent advances in telemedicine, however, have enabled specialist opinion to be sought, thereby reducing the gap in knowledge and helping vulnerable groups across different settings. Tackling the poor healthcare of these patients is an important step in promoting health equality and improving the quality-of-life of children worldwide.

### Ichthyosis in the newborn [^a4f43fc1]. Seminars in Perinatology (2013). Low credibility.

The ichthyoses encompass a variety of genetic disorders marked by abnormal epidermal differentiation. The neonatal period is critical for patients with ichthyosis because of the risk for significant associated morbidity and mortality, with the majority of complications arising as a result of impaired barrier function. This article reviews presentations of ichthyosis in the neonate, outlines risks and complications, and provides strategies for management.

### International classification of diseases (ICD-11) and neurologic disorders: the future [^cd55411e]. Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

When the WHO's Topic Advisory Group for Neurology (TAG) started work on revision of the ICD-10 diagnostic codes in June 2009, the issues were daunting. The existing classification was produced a generation ago and the need to move to the digital age was becoming imperative. Appreciating modern advances in genetics and immunology, and the consequent changes in understanding of the pathophysiology of disorders of the nervous system, WHO's charge to the TAG was to produce a comprehensive, up-to-date disease classification, while providing published or consensus evidence for each coding change. In addition, the task would be to focus on ways to reduce the treatment gap while considering the utility of ICD-11 when used in primary care and nonspecialist settings. The project mushroomed over the 3 years since our first meeting and continues to do so. The work was made even more difficult as the group needed to add "content models" for the major codes for the first time (i.e., providing a definition for each disorder, along with appropriate diagnostic tests and outcome). The ICD-11 is meant to be updated as new knowledge develops, rather than waiting some years for another whole-scale revision, but this process has yet to be defined.

### X-linked ichthyosis: an oculocutaneous genodermatosis [^35ba3ce3]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

X-linked ichthyosis (XLI) is an X-linked recessive disorder of cutaneous keratinization with possible extracutaneous manifestations. It was first described as a distinct type of ichthyosis in 1965. XLI is caused by a deficiency in steroid sulfatase activity, which results in abnormal desquamation and a retention hyperkeratosis. XLI is usually evident during the first few weeks of life as polygonal, loosely adherent translucent scales in a generalized distribution that desquamate widely. These are quickly replaced by large, dark brown, tightly adherent scales occurring primarily symmetrically on the extensor surfaces and the side of the trunk. In addition, extracutaneous manifestations such as corneal opacities, cryptorchidism, and abnormalities related to contiguous gene syndromes may be observed. Diagnosis of XLI is usually made clinically, as the histopathology is nonspecific, but confirmation may be obtained through either biochemical or genetic analysis. Treatment should focus on cutaneous hydration, lubrication, and keratolysis and includes topical moisturizers and topical retinoids.

### Blepharitis preferred practice pattern ® [^ccf9d77a]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Blepharitis ICD-10 CM coding — Blepharitis, which includes entities with the following ICD-10 classifications, lists Ulcerative (H01.01-), Squamous (H01.02-), Stye (H00.01-), Meibomitis (H01.02-), Abscess of eyelid (H00.03-), and Parasitic infestation of eyelid (B89). CM = Clinical Modification used in the United States; "(-) = 1, right upper eyelid; 2, right lower eyelid; 4, left upper eyelid; 5, left lower eyelid", and when laterality is specified "Right upper eyelid is always 1", "Right lower eyelid is always 2", "Left upper eyelid is always 4", and "Left lower eyelid is always 5". "Certain ICD-10 CM categories have applicable 7th characters" and "The 7th character must always be the 7th character in the data field"; if a 7th character is required and the code is "not 6 characters, a placeholder X must be used to fill in the empty characters". For bilateral sites, "the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality"; if no bilateral code exists and the condition is bilateral, "separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned" and "Unspecified codes should only be used when there is no other code option available". A starred note instructs to "Code first underlying disease, as leishmaniasis (085.0–085.9), loiasis (125.2), onchocerciasis (125.3), or pediculosis (132.0)".

### Complex care of individuals with multiple sulfatase deficiency: clinical cases and consensus statement [^38034284]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Multiple sulfatase deficiency (MSD) is an ultra-rare neurodegenerative disorder that results in defective sulfatase post-translational modification. Sulfatases in the body are activated by a unique protein, formylglycine-generating enzyme (FGE) that is encoded by SUMF1. When FGE is absent or insufficient, all 17 known human sulfatases are affected, including the enzymes associated with metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD), several mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS II, IIIA, IIID, IVA, VI), chondrodysplasia punctata, and X-linked ichthyosis. As such, individuals demonstrate a complex and severe clinical phenotype that has not been fully characterized to date. In this report, we describe two individuals with distinct clinical presentations of MSD. Also, we detail a comprehensive systems-based approach to the management of individuals with MSD, from the initial diagnostic evaluation to unique multisystem issues and potential management options. As there have been no natural history studies to date, the recommendations within this report are based on published studies and consensus opinion and underscore the need for future research on evidence-based outcomes to improve management of children with MSD.

### Revised nomenclature and classification of inherited ichthyoses: results of the first ichthyosis consensus conference in sorèze 2009 [^f1153814]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Inherited ichthyoses belong to a large, clinically and etiologically heterogeneous group of mendelian disorders of cornification, typically involving the entire integument. Over the recent years, much progress has been made defining their molecular causes. However, there is no internationally accepted classification and terminology.

Objective

We sought to establish a consensus for the nomenclature and classification of inherited ichthyoses.

Methods

The classification project started at the First World Conference on Ichthyosis in 2007. A large international network of expert clinicians, skin pathologists, and geneticists entertained an interactive dialogue over 2 years, eventually leading to the First Ichthyosis Consensus Conference held in Sorèze, France, on January 23 and 24, 2009, where subcommittees on different issues proposed terminology that was debated until consensus was reached.

Results

It was agreed that currently the nosology should remain clinically based. "Syndromic" versus "nonsyndromic" forms provide a useful major subdivision. Several clinical terms and controversial disease names have been redefined: eg, the group caused by keratin mutations is referred to by the umbrella term, "keratinopathic ichthyosis"-under which are included epidermolytic ichthyosis, superficial epidermolytic ichthyosis, and ichthyosis Curth-Macklin. "Autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis" is proposed as an umbrella term for the harlequin ichthyosis, lamellar ichthyosis, and the congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma group.

Limitations

As more becomes known about these diseases in the future, modifications will be needed.

Conclusion

We have achieved an international consensus for the classification of inherited ichthyosis that should be useful for all clinicians and can serve as reference point for future research.

### Recognition and management of congenital ichthyosis in a low-income setting [^7037a370]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Global health problem analysis

Congenital Ichthyosis (CI) is a chronic condition that occurs worldwide. Lack of early recognition and diagnostic tools can lead to poor outcomes, particularly in low and middle-income countries (LMICs)

CIs represent a heterogeneous group of genetic skin diseases, primarily characterised by a defective skin barrier, hyperkeratosis and scaling, often associated with skin inflammation. Autosomal recessive CIs, including LI, are estimated to occur in approximately 1 in 100 000 to 1 in 300 000 births worldwide. There is a paucity of data regarding ichthyoses in LMICs and estimates of incidence specifically in Sub-Saharan Africa are not known; a limited number of published case-reports highlight the difficulties in diagnosis and management of more severe subtypes.

CIs present at birth or within the early weeks of life. Diagnosis is based upon the integration of clinical history of the skin abnormalities, including time-of-onset, pattern of development, natural evolution and family history; examination to identify key cutaneous and associated extra-cutaneous manifestations; and investigations, such as histopathological features on skin biopsy or genetic testing, if available.

In high-income settings, CI is often recognised promptly, particularly in centres with strong dermatological expertise. By contrast, early identification of CI remains a challenge in LMICs, including Sub-Saharan Africa, further exacerbated if a delivery has taken place at home or at a poorly equipped birth centre in a rural or community setting. Rates of home birth vary widely; UNICEF recently estimated that, in Sub-Saharan Africa, up to 44% of women do not give birth in a health facility (2011–2016) and 44% of births are not attended by skilled health personnel (2013–2016). In these cases, CI may not to be recognised nor appropriate action taken. There is also often a preference for and/or easier access to traditional community healers who are either unlikely to have any experience of these conditions, given their rarity, or may recommend measures that exacerbate poor outcomes. Delays in provision of supportive management increase the risks of dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, hypothermia, superimposed infection and further skin and eye damage. Minimal specific data are available on the morbidity and mortality related to LI subtype in LMICs; harlequin ichthyosis, a more severe form of CI, has been associated with a mortality rate of up to 44%, with most deaths occurring in the first 3 months of life primarily due to sepsis and/or respiratory failure.

### A new way to classify genetic skin disease [^04d27fec]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Genetic disorders with skin manifestations often affect other organs as well, and diseases with a similar array of features might be linked pathogenetically. Classifying disorders by individual phenotypic components may reveal clusters with a common genetic cause and elucidate pathogenic links. If components are categorized inadequately, however, the method will simply confirm what is known, obscure true links, and suggest false ones.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^439852f4]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Diagnostic codes are widely used within health care in the US for reimbursement, quality assessment, public health reporting, calculating risk-adjusted payments, and studying clinical outcomes. In October 2015, the US switched its diagnostic coding system from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to the more detailed International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM), expanding the number of available codes nearly 5-fold. Previous studies have noted discontinuities in specific disease or population subgroups. This interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study sought to quantify the magnitude of change in prevalence in all diagnostic categories for 3 widely used diagnostic classification systems and to explore potential reasons for these changes through selected clinical review.

### Conjunctivitis preferred practice pattern [^5e1c6ada]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Conjunctivitis PPP — ICD-10 CM coding rules for seventh characters and laterality state that the applicable 7th character is required for all codes within the category and must always be the 7th character in the data field; if a code that requires a 7th character is not 6 characters, a placeholder X must be used to fill in the empty characters. For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality; if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned, and unspecified codes should only be used when there is no other code option available. When the diagnosis code specifies laterality, regardless of which digit it is found in (i.e., 4th digit, 5th digit, or 6th digit), right is always 1, left is always 2, and bilateral is always 3.

### Inherited nonsyndromic ichthyoses: an update on pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment [^92ae246f]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Autosomal Recessive Congenital Ichthyosis (ARCI)

ARCI is a genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous group of disorders that includes HI, LI, and CIE. A fourth group of patients with milder phenotypes has previously been described as 'non-LI/non-CIE'. Recently, a new name, pleomorphic ichthyosis (PI), was proposed for this subgroup, based on one of the definitions of pleomorphism: "a condition in which an individual assumes a number of different forms during its life cycle" (Oxford Medical Dictionary). At birth, patients in the PI subgroup usually show severe signs of ichthyosis, but following a spontaneous improvement during childhood, only minor skin symptoms remain thereafter, albeit sometimes exaggerated by environmental factors, such as heat and skin irritation. Examples of disorders fitting into this group are IPS (see Sect. 2.3), self-healing collodion baby/self-improving collodion ichthyosis, and bathing suit ichthyosis (see Fig. 1 c; for review see) (also see footnote). 1

### Complications of ichthyosis beyond the skin [^f1cca975]. Dermatologic Therapy (2013). Low credibility.

Although ichthyoses are noted for their skin features, like many dermatologic conditions, patients are often impacted in ways beyond the skin. Much has been described in recent years regarding quality of life and skin disorders. This is certainly the case for ichthyosis. For neonates or others with diffuse involvement of their skin, nutritional needs are often exceeding normal requirements. These can often result in growth abnormalities. Lastly, with specific subtypes of ichthyosis, compromise of tissues around the eyes and ears can be of concern to some patients. Certainly, some forms of ichthyosis are routinely complicated by such findings. It is important for practitioners caring for individuals with ichthyosis to have these issues in mind.

### Global classification of mast cell activation disorders: an ICD-10-CM-adjusted proposal of the ECNM-AIM consortium [^4eb4edcb]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

Mast cell activation (MCA) is common and occurs in a number of pathologic conditions, including IgE-dependent and independent allergic reactions, atopic disorders, autoimmune processes, and mastocytosis. In a subset of patients, no underlying disease and no known trigger of MCA are found. When the symptoms are severe, systemic, and recurrent, and accompanied by a diagnostic increase in the serum tryptase level or other mast cell mediators, an MCA syndrome (MCAS) may be diagnosed. In these patients, the symptoms typically respond to drugs suppressing MCA, mediator production in mast cells, or mediator effects. In each case, diagnostic consensus criteria must be fulfilled to diagnose MCAS. In other patients, MCA may be local, less severe, or less acute, or may be suspected but not confirmed, so that the diagnostic criteria of MCAS are not fulfilled. In these patients, it may be difficult to prove MCA, for example, by measuring multiple mast cell mediators or basophil activation, the latter as a surrogate of IgE-dependent hypersensitivity. However, validated diagnostic criteria for implicating suspected MCA behind such conditions are lacking, even if some of these conditions have recently been assigned to an International Classification of Diseases-10-Clinical Modification code (ICD-10-CM). In this article, we discuss diagnostic features and criteria and propose a ICD-10-CM-adjusted classification for disorders associated with MCA, herein referred to as MCA disorders (MCADs), with special emphasis on the delineation between confirmed MCAS, MCAD not fulfilling MCAS criteria, and suspected MCAD that is not present. In addition, we discuss the discrimination between overt MCAD and predisposing conditions, such as atopic states, mastocytosis, and hereditary alpha tryptasemia.

### Characterizing diagnostic delays in metachromatic leukodystrophy: a real-world data approach [^5778daa7]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

The International Classification of Diseases (ICD), maintained by the World Health Organization (WHO), is the global standard for coding diagnoses, symptoms, and procedures. Used by providers, auditors, and researchers, ICD codes (ICD‐10‐CM) support documentation, billing, and epidemiological research. Based on ICD coding, medical claims databases (payor‐system databases) are an alternative type of electronic record collection that support collation of patient‐level de‐identified information, irrespective of the hospital or care provider. ICD‐10‐CM codes, tracked through claims databases, can be used to map high‐level information related to the medical journey across hospital systems.

In this study, we evaluate the early features of disease prior to diagnosis using a payor‐system database, specifically focusing on differences by sex and payor type (private vs. public insurance) in the time from onset of symptoms to diagnosis, and compare this to a natural history study which used medical records to retrospectively map medical events prior to diagnosis.

### Consensus recommendations for the use of retinoids in ichthyosis and other disorders of cornification in children and adolescents [^6c975239]. Pediatric Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

DISCLAIMER

The Work Group acknowledges that the ichthyoses and other disorders of cornification are a heterogeneous group of disorders with widely varying prevalence and pathogenetic mechanisms. Clinically, the severity of cutaneous expression, systemic associations, and comorbidities are also disparate. High quality, randomized clinical trials are not available. Thus, these recommendations are made using best available data and the collective clinical experience of the Work Group. These recommendations should not be applied to any patient without careful individualization of the therapeutic plan based on specific patient information and thoughtful provider‐patient discussion of potential risks and benefits.

### Corneal edema and opacification preferred practice pattern ® [^14409d67]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Corneal opacification — ICD-10 CM classifications list minor corneal opacity H17.81-, peripheral corneal opacity H17.82-, central corneal opacity H17.1-, and phthisical cornea A18.59, H44.52-. Certain ICD-10 CM categories have applicable 7th characters; the applicable 7th character is required for all codes within the category, the 7th character must always be the 7th character in the data field, and if a code that requires a 7th character is not 6 characters, a placeholder X must be used to fill in the empty characters. For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality; if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, assign separate codes for both the left and right side, and unspecified codes should only be used when there is no other code option available. When the diagnosis code specifies laterality (i.e., 4th digit, 5th digit, or 6th digit), Right is always 1, Left is always 2, and Bilateral is always 3.

### Syndromic epidermal differentiation disorders: a new classification toward pathogenesis-based therapy [^42a70728]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Since the 2010 classification of ichthyoses, our understanding of hereditary epidermal differentiation disorders (EDDs) has markedly increased, allowing consideration of new therapeutic targets based on disease pathogenesis. A new gene- and protein product function-based classification focuses on shared mechanisms of disease pathogenesis, with the possibility that grouped disorders may respond similarly to new therapeutics. These EDDs have been subdivided into syndromic (sEDD), nonsyndromic with features limited to skin and appendages (nEDD), and predominantly palmoplantar skin involvement (pEDD, nonsyndromic and syndromic). The sEDDs have clinically important extracutaneous features related to the gene alteration. Often, recognition based on skin manifestations facilitates early gene-based diagnosis, discussion of prognosis, genetic counseling, and initiation of therapy. All sEDDs are rare, the most common of which are STS-sEDD (formerly known as X-linked ichthyosis) and SPINK5-sEDD (formerly known as Netherton syndrome). Given the rarity, frequent association with early demise, and variable clinical features of sEDDs, their disease natural history with advancing age and genotype-phenotype relationships are poorly defined. Among the 51 sEDDs, associated neurologic (71%) and/or ophthalmologic (49%) findings are most common, and 39% have hair abnormalities. The widespread use of topical lovastatin-cholesterol for cholesterol synthesis-related sEDDs represents the prototype of pathogenesis-based therapy. This concept of upstream inhibition to prevent metabolite accumulation and supplementation with pathway end product potentially applies to other sEDDs, such as those affecting ceramide synthesis and transport. Topical or systemically administered inhibition of activated pathways is another potential approach, exemplified by the emerging treatment with kallikrein inhibitors for SPINK5-sEDD. Many sEDDs may be amenable to gene editing or introduction of functional cDNA. However, even systemic treatments targeting cutaneous diseases may not address extracutaneous manifestations that arise during embryologic development.

### Characterizing diagnostic delays in metachromatic leukodystrophy: a real-world data approach [^301045c6]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

All retrospective approaches are influenced by biases in documentation and care. Both ethnicity and race are known to influence the determination of the severity of medical concerns, which would be indirectly reflected in the medical documentation and medical coding. The public payor status and use of claims databases are more likely to include a representative population compared to the natural history cohort. An additional limitation is that the claims databases rely on ICD‐10‐CM codes without access to medical records to allow for confirmation. As such, the data available are dependent on how the provider coded medical concerns. This affects both the diagnosis of MLD as well as disease‐specific symptoms. In particular, we are unable to verify the MLD diagnosis by standard methods (genotype, enzyme level, or sulfatides) or confirm standard definitions of disease‐related symptoms. In addition, the timepoint available for the onset of a given prodromal symptom represents the first use of the ICD‐10‐CM code within the electronic health record and may be delayed compared to when the family first had concern. For example, a child may have had strabismus for several months prior to medical evaluation or diagnosis based on access to care. If this is the case, then our study could potentially be underestimating the time from the onset of prodromal symptoms to MLD diagnosis. To this end, our cohort only captured patients diagnosed in the final year of the database (2023). Based on the range of eligible individuals within the prior years and the incidence of MLD, it is probable that approximately 20–30 patients will have been ultimately diagnosed with MLD.

### Ready or not! here comes ICD-10 [^7cb0ab4c]. Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

The International Classification of Diseases-10 (ICD-10) is a new system that is a federally mandated change affecting all payers and providers, and is expected to exceed both the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and Y2K in terms of costs and risks. In 2003, HIPAA named ICD-9 as the code set for supporting diagnoses and procedures in electronic administrative transactions. However, on 16 January 2009, the Department of Health and Human Services published a regulation requiring the replacement of ICD-9 with ICD-10 as of 1 October 2013. While ICD-9 and ICD-10 have a similar type of hierarchy in their structures, ICD-10 is more complex and incorporates numerous changes. Overall, ICD-10 contains more than 141 000 codes, a whopping 712% increase over the < 20 000 codes in ICD-9, creating enormous complexities, confusion and expense. Published statistics illustrate that there are instances where a single ICD-9 code can map to more than 50 distinct ICD-10 codes. Also, there are multiple instances where a single ICD-10 code can map to more than one ICD-9 code. Proponents of the new ICD-10 system argue that the granularity should lead to improvements in the quality of healthcare whereas detractors of the system see the same granularity as burdensome. The estimated cost per physician is projected to range from $25 000 to $50 000.

### Pediatric application of coding and valuation systems [^d495525c]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

ICD-10-CM impact on payment — Pediatricians "should use the specificity of the ICD-10-CM to accurately reflect the child's conditions and complexity", and when "sufficient clinical information is not known or available about a particular health condition, the payer should recognize that the clinician can appropriately report an unspecified code without the claim being summarily denied solely on the basis of specificity". Furthermore, payers "should not use ICD-10-CM specificity to deny payment to appropriately trained pediatricians performing those specialized services within their scope of practice". New payment models "incorporate elaborate risk-adjustment algorithms based on diagnostic completeness", and such risk-based models "must appropriately represent the risk contributed by children with special health care needs". To support diagnostic comprehensiveness, "claim-form formatting should be expanded (such as doubling to 8) to accommodate more than 4 diagnoses per line-item service", exceeding "the current line-item limitation for the version 5010 CMS 837P electronic and 1500 paper claim forms".

Results

Participants

We recruited 371 participants: 54 men with XLI, 83 women who were carriers of XLI‐associated genetic variants, 23 men with IV, 59 women with IV, 30 men with psoriasis and 122 women with psoriasis. Participants were predominantly diagnosed by a medical professional taking into account family history and with a confirmatory biochemical/genetic test where appropriate. Groups were closely matched for age (medians 40–50 years, H (5) = 5.11, P = 0.40), country of residence (74%–87% UK/North America), ethnicity (74%–91% white European descent) and highest academic qualification (63%–85% college, university or postgraduate education). The mean self‐reported skin severity was similar (moderate) across groups (40%–53% of maximum score on CISI/PASI).

Psychological diagnoses

We summarized the prevalence of previous diagnoses of mood or neurodevelopmental condition across the six groups and compared this with lifetime diagnostic prevalence in the general population (Table 1). The prevalence of depression diagnoses across all groups was noticeably higher than in the general population and, interestingly, was highest in XLI carrier women, even though these individuals display mild, if any, skin symptoms. The prevalence of anxiety disorder diagnoses was only substantially higher than the general population prevalence for both men with XLI and XLI carrier women, and for men with IV. The prevalence of previous bipolar disorder diagnoses was slightly higher in women with IV group than in the general population, but no similar effect was seen for the other groups. The prevalence of neurodevelopmental disorder diagnoses was substantially higher than the general population prevalence in both men with XLI and women who were carriers of XLI, but not in the other groups. The prevalence of dyslexia diagnoses was low and comparable with the general population rate, across all groups.

Centre lines show the medians, box limits indicate the 25th and 75th percentiles as determined by R software, and whiskers extend 1.5 times the interquartile range from the 25th and 75th percentiles. Mean values for general population normative samples for both men and women are shown for comparison. IV, ichthyosis vulgaris; XLI, X‐linked ichthyosis.

AQ10 scores across all groups were, moderately and significantly, higher (Cohen d = 0.31–0.70, P < 0.05) than those observed in a previously reportedunscreened adult (45–64 years) sample of 10 796 women and 7904 men recruited through a general population health survey in Sweden (Fig. 1b, Supplementary Table S2). As expected, AQ10 scores were higher in men than in women (effect of sex: F (1,319) = 7.44, P < 0.01), but did not differ by condition (F (2,319) = 2.86, P = 0.06) or as a function of condition × sex (F (2,319) = 0.37, P = 0.69) (Fig. 1b).

Scores on Part A of the ASRS were also significantly higher (Cohen d = 0.59–0.91, P < 0.05) in all of our experimental groups than in a previously reported group of general population controls[unscreened community‐recruited Australian adult (47–54 years) sample of 1098 women and 993 men] (Fig. 1c, Supplementary Table S2). Inattentive symptom scores were higher than hyperactive–impulsive symptom counts in all groups (Supplementary Table S3). ASRS scores did not differ by condition (F (2,334) = 0.79, P = 0.46) or sex (F (1,334) = 1.84, P = 0.18) or as a function of condition × sex (F (2,334) = 0.51, P = 0.60) (Fig. 1c).

### Inherited nonsyndromic ichthyoses: an update on pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment [^7a1d4d46]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Hereditary ichthyoses are due to mutations on one or both alleles of more than 30 different genes, mainly expressed in the upper epidermis. Syndromic as well as nonsyndromic forms of ichthyosis exist. Irrespective of etiology, virtually all types of ichthyosis exhibit a defective epidermal barrier that constitutes the driving force for hyperkeratosis, skin scaling, and inflammation. In nonsyndromic forms, these features are most evident in severe autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis (ARCI) and epidermolytic ichthyosis, but to some extent also occur in the common type of non-congenital ichthyosis. A correct diagnosis of ichthyosis — essential not only for genetic counseling but also for adequate patient information about prognosis and therapeutic options — is becoming increasingly feasible thanks to recent progress in genetic knowledge and DNA sequencing methods. This paper reviews the most important aspects of nonsyndromic ichthyoses, focusing on new knowledge about the pathophysiology of the disorders, which will hopefully lead to novel ideas about therapy.

### Pediatric application of coding and valuation systems [^449cf18a]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Pediatric diagnostic classification — ICD-10-CM and DC: 0–5 relationship states that although the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) remains the HIPAA-mandated code set for diagnostic selection in electronic transactions, mental health disorders in infancy and early childhood are also addressed by the Diagnostic Classification of Mental and Developmental Disorders of Infancy and Early Childhood (DC: 0–5). DC: 0–5 is "especially relevant to pediatrics", crosswalks to ICD-10-CM exist but are "not one-to-one", and DC: 0–5 "is not intended to represent a claims-based diagnostic set" but "is intended to complement ICD-10-CM" with guidance such as cultural variables. As ICD-10-CM expands yearly with new codes, alignment opportunities between DC: 0–5 and ICD-10-CM may increase.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^e325508b]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Methods

Data and Study Sample

We used the IBM MarketScan Commercial Database from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2017, including individuals ages 0 to 64 years enrolled in noncapitated commercial insurance plans with both medical and pharmacy benefits. The MarketScan database contains deidentified health care claims information from US employers, health plans, and hospitals. Data on all enrollment records and inpatient, outpatient, ancillary, and drug claims are collated and linked to individuals. The age and sex distribution of the eligible population varied little over the 96 months studied. Boston University's institutional review board exempted this study from review and informed consent owing to the use of deidentified data. Data were analyzed from December 1, 2018, to January 21, 2020.

Outcome

Our primary outcome was the monthly rate of individuals with at least 1 diagnosis in a diagnostic classification category per 10 000 enrollees. We used claim dates of service, health care practitioner type, and inpatient and outpatient procedure codes to identify claims that are allowed to contribute diagnostic codes, mimicking Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) filters used in risk adjustment, which only consider diagnoses from an acceptable health care practitioner claim type: hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient, or professional. Monthly prevalence rates were examined for changes in reported diagnostic category prevalence at and following the October 2015 ICD-10-CM transition.

Diagnostic Classification Systems

There were 14 567 allowable ICD-9-CM codes in 2015 vs 71 486 allowable ICD-10-CM codes in 2017 to describe patient medical conditions. To reduce complexity, predictive models and disease tracking systems rely on classification systems (ie, groupers) to collapse these codes into a smaller number of broadly homogeneous clinical categories. We explored 3 commonly used classification systems.

The World Health Organization (WHO) maps codes into chapters, which are commonly used for epidemiology and surveillance, based on their first 3 alphanumeric characters. The WHO's ICD-9-CM mapping had 19 chapters, which expanded to 21 chapters with the transition to ICD-10-CM by separating previously grouped eye, ear, and neurological disorders into distinct chapters. To facilitate cross-year comparisons, we maintained the 19-chapter structure.

### The rendering of human phenotype and rare diseases in ICD-11 [^28d3d4c4]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2018). Low credibility.

Classifications

Classifications are not ontologies, nor are they intended to be. In their most simple form, a classification is a set of categories intended to aggregate a large number of things into a relatively smaller number of groups. Like ontologies, a classification may invoke an ordered hierarchy of categories, invoking increasingly specific category subtypes with each layer of the hierarchy. The connection between one level of a hierarchy and another is rarely specified by the logically formal "is-a" relationship, but more typically informal "broader-than" or "narrower-than" assertions; this is known as the Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) (W3C) Classifications are not intended to support logical reasoning, though they can help to organize concepts and can have profound effects on technology and social attitudes (Bowker and Star).

### The impact of conversion to international classification of diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10) on an academic ophthalmology practice [^953a5a45]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

The conversion from the International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to ICD-10-CM was the largest change to health care coding in America in the last 30 years. While ICD-10 was approved in 1990 and had been utilized in several countries since as early as 1994, its use only became required in the United States on October 1, 2015. The version used in the United States has several significant modifications suggested during an open comment period and via a field test performed by The American Hospital Association and the American Health Information Management Association. ICD-10-CM, as the version is known, added many more codes than the original World Health Organization version used prior to adoption in the United States. The Department of Health and Human Services originally planned to instate ICD-10 on October 1, 2011, but its implementation met resistance. The American Medical Association feared that the costs of implementing ICD-10 would be extreme and could even put smaller practices out of business. In 2009, the Department of Health and Human Services changed the date to October 1, 2013. Two additional delays led to the final implementation date of October 1, 2015.

Each ICD-10 code has space for seven characters, an increase from the five available in ICD-9. The nearly 70,000 diagnostic codes available in ICD-10 provide a much greater level of detail than the 14,500 codes available in ICD-9, and mapping diagnoses from one to the other is often convoluted and rarely straightforward. Included in the increased details are codes that specify laterality and severity of disease, features that have a substantial effect on coding in ophthalmology. The increased level of detail is projected to lead to an eventual decrease in denied claims. Unfortunately, this decrease in rejected claims is expected to occur after a period of increased rejected claims lasting from 6 months to 3 years as coders adapt to the new system.–The more detailed information available from ICD-10 codes is also predicted to more easily identify fraud and abuse, give insurance companies more accurate information in order to make coverage decisions, and improve public health monitoring and research. Notably a dually coded database in Canada showed no improvement in the validity of coding with ICD-10 compared to ICD-9. However, a Swedish study did show continual improvement in the accuracy of recording conditions using ICD-10 over a 5-year period related to a coding learning curve.

There was no overall difference in coder efficiency in the 1-year periods before and after ICD-10 implementation (P = 0.76). However, we noted a reduction in coder efficiency during the first 4 months (October 2015 to January 2016) after ICD-10 conversion, which returned to baseline for the remaining 8 months (Figure 2).

### The diagnostic trajectory of infants and children with clinical features of genetic disease [^68ee46a4]. NPJ Genomic Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Our study has strengths and limitations. Strengths include the size of the population evaluated — which included over 13 million unique patients from a large commercial health plan population, representative of commercially-insured patients more generally. Our methodology, which included a detailed curation of indicators of genetic disease, allowed us to evaluate several different populations of patients based on different levels of specificity. Finally, our administrative claims-based approach allowed for a comprehensive assessment of direct healthcare-related utilization and costs. Several limitations should be considered in the interpretation of our results. First, as our methodology utilized insurance claims data as opposed to electronic health records, we are limited in our ability to interpret both diagnostic thinking and clinical decision-making. For example, while we observe substantial delays in genetic testing in many patients, the reasons for these delays are unclear and may be clinically warranted based on the unique circumstances of individual patients. Similarly, ICD-9/10 codes do not capture the granularity required to distinguish diagnosed genetic conditions. Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) provides a deep ontology that relates detailed clinical features to both diseases and genes. Availability of HPO terms in a large data set like this would have improved our specificity in defining populations and HPO coding (or improvements in ICD coding informed by HPO) could contribute to future studies of genetic disease in populations. In addition, while some genetic diseases have specific ICD-9/10 codes, many do not; thus, we are unable to definitively determine the end of a diagnostic odyssey for many individual patients. Second, our definitions of possible, probable and definite genetic disease are based on expert opinion and manual curation. Not all patients with these features would have had a genetic diagnosis even if optimal testing had been performed. This is likely due to additional undescribed disease-causing genes, oligogenic and complex inheritance, and environmental phenocopies. How ICD-9/10 codes are used for insurance billing purposes may not be aligned with the diagnostic thinking of clinicians. Coding systems, including diagnosis and procedure codes, are used for billing purposes and are likely to fail to reflect the variability observed in clinical practice. Furthermore, a level of miscoding is presumed to occur as is inherent in claims database studies (e.g. a coding specialist may select the first code on a list of possible codes as opposed to the most appropriate code). Third, given the substantial health conditions of patients with genetic diseases, patients may transition to public insurance programs, switch between private insurance plans, or for other reasons stopped being observed in the database. Although our continuous enrollment requirements help control for some of this variability, there are inherent limitations to the comprehensiveness of the follow-up, which could also be exacerbated by the severity of the disease. Finally, in our selection of patients, we found a large number of newborns with codes indicating a possible genetic condition but no stay in a NICU. Because we required a stay in a NICU, these patients were excluded from analysis in the critically-ill infant population and were instead included in the pediatric population.

Clinical recommendations were developed on the best available evidence tabled in the guideline. The strength of recommendation was ranked as follows:
Recommendation based on consistent and good‐quality patient‐oriented evidence.
Recommendation based on inconsistent or limited quality patient‐oriented evidence.
Recommendation based on consensus, opinion, case studies, or disease‐oriented evidence.

In those situations where documented evidence‐based data were not available, or showing inconsistent or limited conclusions, expert opinion and medical consensus was utilized to generate clinical recommendations

### Annual direct and indirect health costs of the congenital ichthyoses [^9253fb4d]. Pediatric Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

The aim of this study is to estimate annual, per patient, health care costs for congenital ichthyoses (CI). We conducted a cost analysis through an online survey posted on the Foundation for Ichthyosis and Related Skin Types Website. We assessed cutaneous disease severity, via the previously validated Congenital Ichthyosis Severity Index (CISI), demographics, and CI type. We estimated direct health care costs: prescription and over-the-counter medications, outpatient visits, and emergency department and hospital visit costs; and indirect costs: earnings lost owing to absences from work because of CI-related illness. The CI subjects of our study (n = 224) consumed a mean (SD) of $3,192 ($7,915) annually. Direct costs accounted for 90%, whereas indirect costs accounted for 10%. These costs resulted in an estimated annual cost of $37 MM/year (excluding ichthyosis vulgaris) of which $17 MM is borne out-of-pocket by patients. Depending on the CI diagnosis, patients were responsible for 30–51 cents of every dollar of mean annual medical care costs. Our estimated annual CI costs are comparable to cutaneous lymphoma. More effective treatments for CI would help minimize this burden. Traditional insurance products do not appear to substantially alleviate the financial burden of disease, as a significant amount is from out-of-pocket expenses.

### The collective impact of rare diseases in Western Australia: an estimate using a population-based cohort [^4008fea7]. Genetics in Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The whole cohort of this study represents 2.0% of the state population in 2010. This is comparable to a study by Mazzucato et al. that extrapolated prevalence data calculated from a population-based registry to estimate that 1.3 to 2% of the European Union population are living with an RD. However, this is considerably lower than the usually reported estimates of 6–8% of the population living with an RD. Results from this study should be considered as minimum values for reasons that include the following: (i) the RD resource set used in this study contained only 467 of the estimated 6,000 to 8,000 RD, (ii) RD are likely to be incorrectly or insufficiently coded in administrative data sets because physicians may not know or use appropriate codes for certain RD, and (iii) people who used outpatient, general practitioner, emergency, and allied health services without inpatient services were not included. Although it is difficult to estimate the extent, these factors could contribute to a significant underestimate of the number of people in WA with an RD.

Substantial elements of the shortfalls of RD coding internationally will be addressed through the next release of ICD codes (ICD-11). Specifically, Orphanet coding is expected to be formally integrated within ICD-11. This means there will be an internationally accepted and comprehensive data-classification system that supports RD if and when ICD-11 is adopted and implemented. Health-data systems may consider earlier incorporation of Orpha codes into data collections so that as ICD-11 is introduced into health-data collections, there will be the capacity to continue to effectively record and report local RD data. Such actions are consistent with the European Commission Expert Group on RD recommendation adopted in November 2014 for national health-care coding systems to consider using Orpha codes in addition to ICD-10 codes when an RD has no specific ICD-10 code.

### Association of diagnosis of leukodystrophy with race and ethnicity among pediatric and adolescent patients [^a0d62625]. JAMA Network Open (2018). Medium credibility.

Methods

This study follows the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline for cohort analyses. The study, which used deidentified data, was not considered human subjects research and was exempted by the institutional review boards at the University of Utah and Intermountain Healthcare. We conducted a retrospective case-control study on patients aged 18 years or younger admitted to a Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS) hospital with an International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) diagnosis of leukodystrophy (metachromatic leukodystrophy [E75.25], X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy [E71.52x], Krabbe disease [E75.23], or Hurler disease [E76.01]) between October 1, 2015, and September 30, 2017.

The PHIS database has information from more than 50 children's hospitals in the United States. Hospitals are affiliated with the business alliance of Child Health Corporation of America. Each patient has a unique entry, but the data are deidentified. Data collected include patient and visit demographic characteristics such as age, sex, race, insurance type, type of visit, estimated total visit cost, length of stay, ICD coding, and detailed charge information. The hospital visits included primarily inpatient admissions with additional visit types such as emergency department, observation, ambulatory surgery, and clinic visits. Race and ethnicity were collected as patient- or family-reported answers to separate questions at registration: 1 for race and 1 for ethnicity.

### Posterior vitreous detachment, retinal breaks, and lattice degeneration preferred practice pattern ® [^ab59a3b4]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes — precursors to rhegmatogenous retinal detachment and related entities are mapped between ICD-9 CM and ICD-10 CM, including break, unspecified (361.00; H33.00-), break, giant (361.03; H33.03-), vitreous detachment/degeneration (379.21; H43.81-), and retinal break without detachment types such as retinal break, unspecified (361.30; H33.30-), horseshoe tear (361.32; H33.31-), and round hole (361.31; H33.32-), as well as retinal dialysis (361.04; H33.04-) and lattice degeneration of the retina (362.63; H35.41-). Additional information for ICD-10 CM states that certain categories have applicable 7th characters and that "If a code that requires a 7th character is not 6 characters, a placeholder X must be used", and that for bilateral sites "the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality"; the table specifies " = 1, right eye; 2, left eye; 3, bilateral", and that "Right is always 1", "Left is always 2", and "Bilateral is always 3".

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^5ad88265]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Limitations

This study has several limitations. First, we only examined the association of diagnostic category prevalence with the ICD-10-CM transition for individuals younger than 65 years who were privately insured by employer-sponsored insurance, a population mostly enrolled in relatively generous health plans. Coding patterns and discontinuities in frequencies of diagnostic categories may not generalize to individuals covered by other insurers (eg, the ACA marketplace, Medicare, and Medicaid). Many health care practitioners have been encouraged by their institutions to maximize the capture of patient complexity in their billing. However, our study data came from commercial plans whose payments are rarely risk adjusted for disease prevalence. Specifically, their payments do not generally rely on HHS-HCCs, reducing the explicit incentive to increase the prevalence of well-reimbursed HHS-HCC categories. Second, we did not examine changes at the ICD-10-CM transition on coding for particular conditions for specific patients or in category prevalence based on other sources of diagnoses, such as electronic medical records. Third, we used a piecewise linear model to look for changes in level and trend, but for some categories in which diagnostic category prevalence trends are not linear, our model may find changes at the transition when a nonlinear model would not.

### Retinal and ophthalmic artery occlusions preferred practice pattern ® [^d40700dd]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Retinal arterial occlusion ICD-10 CM codes — Central retinal artery occlusion includes H34.11, H34.12, and H34.13; arterial branch occlusion includes H34.231, H34.232, and H34.233; partial retinal artery occlusion includes H34.211, H34.212, and H34.213; and transient retinal artery occlusion includes H34.01, H34.02, and H34.03. For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality, and if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned, with unspecified codes used only when there is no other code option available. When the diagnosis code specifies laterality, regardless of which digit it is found in, right is always 1, left is always 2, and bilateral is always 3; ICD = International Classification of Diseases and CM = Clinical Modification used in the United States.

### Recognition and management of congenital ichthyosis in a low-income setting [^7e22d485]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Beyond this, telemedicine also faces significant technical challenges. Although the exchange of images for an individual patient may be straightforward, coordinating multiple partnerships and sustaining a reliable system on a larger, more permanent scale is highly demanding. A 2016 review of teledermatology services set up in South Africa since 1999 found that only four still remained operational. There had been minimal escalation of these services with limited support from regional health departments and poor integration into routine healthcare practices. Effective advice also depends on the quality of the information shared, particularly a detailed clinical background and accurate symptom description, which may be suboptimal depending on the experience of those in the field. Furthermore, the remote expert often does not receive feedback on the advice they have given, partly due to the difficulties in confirming the patient's diagnosis and/or poor follow-up of long-term clinical and social outcomes in LMICs; such a feedback loop could improve remote specialist assessment and management of similar cases in the future. Finally, financial and legal frameworks may be complex and difficult to establish fairly and robustly, especially when institutions across different settings are involved. These frameworks not only enable the procurement and maintenance of required equipment, but also ensure that both remote and local staff are appropriately reimbursed and held accountable, protecting patient safety.

### Necessity and implications of ICD-10: facts and fallacies [^9d2fadcf]. Pain Physician (2011). Low credibility.

The International Classification of Diseases-10 (ICD-10 is a new system that is expected to be implemented effective on October 1, 2013. This new system is a federally mandated change affecting all payers and providers, and is expected to exceed both the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and Y2K in terms of costs and risks. However, the Administration is poised to implement these changes at a rapid pace which could be problematic for health care in the United States. In 2003, HIPAA named ICD-9 as the code set for supporting diagnoses and procedures in electronic administrative transactions. However, on January 16, 2009, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) published a regulation requiring the replacement of ICD-9 with ICD-10 as of October 1, 2013. While ICD-9 and 10 have a similar type of hierarchy in their structures, the ICD-10 is more complex and incorporates numerous changes. Overall, ICD-10 contains over 141,000 codes, a whopping 712% increase over the less than 20,000 codes in ICD-9, creating enormous complexities, confusion, and expense. Multiple published statistics illustrate that there are approximately 119 instances where a single ICD-9 code can map to more than 100 distinct ICD-10 codes, whereas there are 255 instances where a single ICD-9 code can map to more than 50 ICD-10 codes. To add to the confusion, there are 3,684 instances in the mapping for diseases where a single ICD-10 code can map to more than one ICD-9 code. Proponents of the new ICD-10 system argue that the granularity should lead to improvements in the quality of health care, since more precise coding that more accurately reflects actual patient conditions will permit smarter and more effective disease management in pay-for-performance programs. This, in essence, encapsulates the benefits that supporters of this new system believe will be realized, even though many of these experts may not be involved in actual day-to-day medical practices. Detractors of the system see the same granularity as burdensome. The estimated cost per physician is projected to range from $25,000 to $50,000. Further, they argue that the ICD-10 classification is extremely complicated, and expensive. Concerns exist that it is being implemented without establishing either the necessity or thinking through the unintended consequences. Opponents also argue that beyond financial expense, it is also costly in terms of human toll, hardware and software expenses and has the potential to delay reimbursement. There is also concern that an unintended consequence of granularity would be the potential for enhanced and unnecessary fraud and abuse investigations. The authors of this article favor postponing the implementation of the ICD-10 until such time as its necessity is proven and implications are understood.

### New coding in the international classification of diseases, ninth revision, for children's interstitial lung disease [^9c9cf4f0]. Chest (2012). Low credibility.

The term "children's interstitial lung disease" (chILD) refers to a heterogeneous group of rare and diffuse lung diseases associated with significant morbidity and mortality. These disorders include neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia of infancy, pulmonary interstitial glycogenosis, surfactant dysfunction mutations, and alveolar capillary dysplasia with misalignment of pulmonary veins. Diagnosis can be challenging, which may lead to a delay in recognition and treatment of these disorders. Recently, International Classifications of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes have been added for several of the chILD disorders. The purpose of this article is to give an overview of the chILD disorders and appropriate diagnostic coding.

### Dermatologic conditions in down syndrome: a multi-site retrospective review of international classification of diseases codes [^4f9d0c03]. Pediatric Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Objective

As the population and life expectancy of people with Down syndrome increases, identifying common skin conditions throughout the lifespan will help inform clinical care and research. We sought to evaluate dermatologic conditions diagnosed in pediatric and adult patients with Down syndrome.

Methods

This multicenter retrospective study analyzed demographic and outpatient visit International Classification of Diseases codes of patients with Down syndrome evaluated at outpatient dermatology clinics in the United States or Canada between 2011 and 2021.

Results

A total of 1529 patients with Down syndrome were identified from eight academic medical centers: 50.8% were children (0-12years), 25.2% were adolescents (13-17years), and 24% were adults (18years and older). Eczematous dermatitis was the most common diagnosis overall (26%), followed by folliculitis (19.3%) and seborrheic dermatitis (15.6%). Other notable diagnoses included dermatophyte infections (13%), alopecia areata (11.6%), and psoriasis (6.7%). About 4.3% of visits included a code for high-risk medication use. Eczematous dermatitis, alopecia areata, and folliculitis were the most common diagnoses observed in children; folliculitis, hidradenitis suppurativa, and eczematous dermatitis in adolescents; and seborrheic dermatitis, eczematous dermatitis, and folliculitis in adults.

Conclusions

Dermatologic conditions in patients with Down syndrome vary by age, but are most often eczematous, adnexal, and cutaneous autoimmune disorders. This multicenter retrospective review identifies skin diseases that should be prioritized for clinical care guideline development and research in the Down syndrome community.

### Evidence of the high prevalence of neurological disorders in nonsyndromic X-linked recessive ichthyosis: a retrospective case series [^364e1da0]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

X-linked recessive ichthyosis (XLI) is a relatively common type of ichthyosis caused by a deficiency in the steroid sulfatase (STS) enzyme. It is the only type of ichthyosis that can be both syndromic and nonsyndromic. Typical clinical features include dark-brown scale of variable size favouring the extensor surfaces of the extremities.

Objectives

To characterize clinically nonsyndromic XLI, with a particular focus on extracutaneous manifestations.

Methods

This was a multicentre retrospective review of clinical findings from a case series of patients with a clinical and genetic diagnosis of XLI.

Results

We identified 30 patients with XLI belonging to 25 different families carrying a deletion in the STS locus. All patients had dark scales of variable size on the extensor surfaces of the extremities. Lack of flexural involvement and pruritus were common but inconsistent findings, whereas palmoplantar hyperlinearity was absent in all but one patient. A history of orchiopexy was present in 10% and thus was more common than expected vs. the general population (3%). Neurological disorders including epilepsy (13%) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; 30%) were over-represented in patients with XLI.

Conclusions

This was a retrospective study with a limited number of patients. In the absence of confirmatory genetic testing and family history of the disease, dark-brown scale of the extensor surfaces and the absence of palmoplantar hyperlinearity appear to be the most reliable clinical findings supporting a diagnosis of XLI. Dermatologists should be aware of the high prevalence of ADHD and epilepsy in patients with nonsyndromic XLI.

### Pediatric complex chronic conditions classification system version 2: updated for ICD-10 and complex medical technology dependence and transplantation [^11ba64d1]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Remarkable advances in pediatric healthcare over the past century have substantially reduced overall childhood morbidity and mortality, while concomitantly enabling some children with complex chronic conditions (CCC) to survive and live longer. A clear definition of these CCCs is important for several reasons: to assess population-level temporal trends in the proportion of morbidity and mortality associated with CCCs; to assess patterns of healthcare utilization among patients with CCCs; and to perform individual-level risk adjustments for patients' CCC status in studies of healthcare processes and outcomes.

In 2000, Feudtner and colleagues developed a definition for CCCs: "Any medical condition that can be reasonably expected to last at least 12 months (unless death intervenes) and to involve either several different organ systems or 1 organ system severely enough to require specialty pediatric care and probably some period of hospitalization in a tertiary care center". Based on this definition, a comprehensive set of codes available at that time from the International Classification of Disease version 9 Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) system were identified as indicative of a CCC, and further categorized into 9 categories (cardiovascular, respiratory, neuromuscular, renal, gastrointestinal, hematologic or immunologic, metabolic, other congenital or genetic, and malignancy).

The CCC classification system (v1) can be used to either examine a particular CCC category or to identify patients with multiple CCC categories. The CCC system was initially applied to studying patterns of pediatric mortality and end-of-life care, and has subsequently been applied to a variety of research problems, including risk adjustment, prediction of adverse health outcomes, and identification of populations with high health care utilization.

The original CCC system, now more than a decade old, warranted revision for 3 main reasons. First, the International Classification of Disease 10th Revision (ICD-10) is replacing the ICD-9 system in the United States. Although already widely used internationally, ICD-10 was first used in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention vital statistics data files in 1999, and government diagnostic and procedural billing codes will change to ICD-10 in 2015. Second, the original CCC system has not been updated to include new diagnostic codes added over the past decade, and in particular the original CCC system does not include a category for conditions originating in the neonatal period. Third, the original CCC system consisted entirely of diagnostic codes and lacked a domain of codes that specify either a likely dependence upon medical technology or having undergone organ (including bone marrow) transplantation, both of which would indicate CCC status.

### Ichthyosis prematurity syndrome: a systematic review of the literature [^b1443a89]. Pediatric Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Background/Objectives

Ichthyosis prematurity syndrome (IPS) is a rare autosomal recessive congenital disorder characterized by premature birth, neonatal respiratory distress, eosinophilia, and a thick, clay‐like vernix at birth. This review aims to summarize the available reported cases of IPS, including genetic etiology, clinical features, management, and prognosis.

Methods

A search was conducted using MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and CINAHL, from inception to September 3, 2024 using the search terms "IPS" or "ichthyosis congenita type IV". This systematic review was registered on the PROSPERO database (CRD42024533988). Any publication reporting a case of IPS was suitable for inclusion. Quality appraisal was performed according to CARE guidelines. Descriptive statistical analysis was performed using R v4.3.1 (R Foundation, Vienna, Austria).

Results

We identified 26 studies reporting 59 cases of IPS (PROSPERO database: CRD42024533988). While IPS was previously thought to predominantly affect Norwegian and Swedish patients, we identified cases from a broad range of ethnicities. The median duration of the cutaneous scale was 10 weeks, though patients usually have persisting atopy. Long‐term prognosis is generally good, although six (10.2%) fulminant cases were identified with an estimated 6‐month survival rate of 87.6% (95% confidence interval: 78.8–97.4). Mortality in these cases was attributed to respiratory and/or cardiac sequelae or sepsis. Limitations include heterogeneity in the reporting of cases and low quality of data in several aspects of data collection.

Conclusions

The cutaneous manifestations of IPS resolve over a period of weeks, and patients generally have a favorable long‐term prognosis. However, rare cases of death and other complications have been reported.

### Characterizing the healthcare utilization and costs of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia [^b4719fa8]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

2 Methods

2.1 Data Source

All analyses utilized the Komodo Healthcare Map claims database. The database includes more than 330 million patients in the United States. Claims data are submitted from multiple insurers including commercial, Medicare and Medicaid plans. Komodo uses Datavant deterministic tokenization to link patients across participating insurers. Identifying information is transformed into a unique, encrypted, and nonidentifiable patient token, such that data remain deidentified and HIPPA compliant at all times.

The database includes patient demographics (age, sex, and three‐digit zip code) and insurance enrollment and disenrollment dates. Inpatient claims include care setting (hospital, skilled nursing, inpatient psychiatric and hospice), admission and all secondary International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD 10) diagnoses and procedures (ICD 10 Procedure Coding System [PCS]; Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System [HCPCS]; and Current Procedural Terminology [CPT]). Outpatient claims include provider, provider specialty (self‐reported), service setting (physician office, emergency room without admission, ambulatory care), all diagnosis and procedure codes. Pharmacy claims include medication (National Drug Code [NDC]); dose; quantity dispensed; prescription fill date, and actual reimbursement.

The study utilized closed claims, that is, deduplicated claims accepted by and paid by health insurance companies. While the data feed is daily, complete data are generally available at 3–6 months to allow for adjudication. Cost data include reimbursed amounts where available and otherwise incorporate Medicare Allowable Payments.

### Updates on coding in dermatology [^85de3cbf]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Correct coding is an important component of effective dermatology practice management. Over the past several years there have been updates to many commonly used codes within dermatology. This review highlights many of these updates, such as: the skin biopsy codes have been subdivided to reflect the different biopsy techniques. The definition of complex linear repairs has been updated and clarified. Outpatient and inpatient evaluation and management visits have new coding guidelines to determine level of care. Dermatopathology consultation codes have been updated and category III codes related to digital pathology have been created. Understanding the details and nuances of each of these categories of codes is vital to ensuring appropriate coding is performed.

### The transition to ICD-10-CM: challenges for pediatric practice [^51ad6a56]. Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Diagnostic codes are used widely within health care for billing, quality assessment, and to measure clinical outcomes. The US health care system will transition to the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM), in October 2015. Little is known about how this transition will affect pediatric practices. The objective of this study was to examine how the transition to ICD-10-CM may result in ambiguity of clinical information and financial disruption for pediatricians.

Methods

Using a statewide data set from Illinois Medicaid specified for pediatricians, 2708 International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification, diagnosis codes were identified. Diagnosis codes were categorized into 1 of 5 categories: identity, class-to-subclass, subclass-to-class, convoluted, and no translation. The convoluted and high-cost diagnostic codes (n = 636) were analyzed for accuracy and categorized into "information loss", "overlapping categories", "inconsistent", and "consistent". Finally, reimbursement by Medicaid was calculated for each category.

Results

Twenty-six percent of pediatric diagnosis codes are convoluted, which represents 21% of Illinois Medicaid pediatric patient encounters and 16% of reimbursement. The diagnosis codes represented by information loss (3.6%), overlapping categories (3.2%), and inconsistent (1.2%) represent 8% of Medicaid pediatric reimbursement.

Conclusions

The potential for financial disruption and administrative errors from 8% of reimbursement diagnosis codes necessitates special attention to these codes in preparing for the transition to ICD-10-CM for pediatric practices.

### Preparing for international classification of diseases, 10th revision, clinical modification implementation: strategies for maintaining an efficient workflow [^204c5163]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2015). Low credibility.

The International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, is required to be used by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services health care billing data starting in October 2015 in the United States. The International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, is an update to the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, and contains approximately 70,000 codes compared with 14,000 codes. We aimed to discuss how our institution is updating the coding system in a manner that alleviates the possible burden placed on providers including more coding information required and longer load times. We performed a simulation test including testing the diagnosis calculator, timing, and how well the new and old codes mapped. We conducted a gap analysis to ensure that coding could begin in October of 2015 with minimal service interruptions. We will describe strategies and procedures to transition between systems while maintaining efficiency and helping to improve classification.

Data exclusions

As part of standard disclosure control procedure, extremely rare diagnoses (those with fewer than five patients with the condition in the dataset) were excluded from further analysis as well as those with invalid ICD-10 codes (assumption 3). Prenatal diagnosis referrals were excluded (assumption 4). ICD-10 codes from chapters 'XVIII Symptoms, signs and abnormal clinical and laboratory findings, not elsewhere classified', 'XIX Injury, poisoning and certain other consequences of external causes', 'XX External causes of morbidity and mortality', 'XXI Factors influencing health status and contact with health services' and 'XXII Codes for special purposes' were excluded from the analysis since the aim was to examine age distributions and associations of only primary medical conditions (assumption 5). For the purposes of clustering only, diagnoses with a prevalence less than or equal to 0.01% (by unique number of patients) were excluded to reduce noise (assumption 6). Refer to online supplemental appendix for a more detailed breakdown of the exclusion process. For the purposes of the study the term 'diagnoses' refers only to those selected through the cohort and data specification described earlier; no independent or objective phenotyping was performed.

### Familiar palmoplantar keratoderma, flaccid blisters, and widespread scaling [^b271c23f]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Question 2: What skin structure is altered in this disease?
A. Steroid sulfatase
B. Keratin 5/keratin 14
C. Filaggrin
D. Transglutaminase 5
E. Keratin 1/keratin 10

Answers:
A. Steroid sulfatase – Incorrect. Hereditary deficiency of steroid sulfatase enzyme leads to X-linked ichthyosis, a disease that mostly affects extensor surfaces, neck, trunk, and lower extremities.
B. Keratin 5/keratin 14 – Incorrect. Keratin 5 and keratin 14 mutations are associated with epidermolysis bullosa simplex, a type of congenital epidermolysis bullosa in which the epidermal and dermal layers of the skin are separated at the basal keratinocyte level.
C. Filaggrin – Incorrect. Mutations in the filaggrin gene are responsible for ichthyosis vulgaris, a disorder clinically expressed by xerosis, palmoplantar hyperlinearity, scaling, and keratosis pilaris.
D. Transglutaminase 5 – Incorrect. Transglutaminase 5 mutations are related to a localized form of PSS known as acral peeling skin syndrome, which involves the continuous shedding of the skin on hands and feet.
E. Keratin 1/keratin 10 – Correct. Both keratin 1 and keratin 10 mutations can justify EI. These genes, respectively located on chromosomes 17q12-21 and 12q11-13, are expressed in the suprabasal layers of epidermis, inhibiting cell proliferation and playing a pivotal role in the cytoskeleton organization. Hence, the lack of gene expression leads to hyperkeratinization. Blistering is common in early EI. Furthermore, EI can occur with or without palmoplantar keratoderma, a finding mostly associated with keratin 1 mutations.

### The phenotype spectrum of X-linked ichthyosis identified by chromosomal microarray [^3c03f144]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Steroid sulfatase (STS) gene disruption causes X-linked ichthyosis (XLI). Interrogating the entire genome through chromosomal microarray (CMA), a test primarily used to screen patients with noncutaneous congenital anomalies, may detect STS deletions incidentally.

Objective

We sought to determine the variability of skin features associated with STS deletions diagnosed through CMA and to compare these findings with XLI cases reported in the literature and recognized in a dermatology clinic.

Methods

Male patients with an STS deletion were identified from 23,172 consecutive postnatal blood samples tested with CMA at Mayo Clinic. A comparison group of male patients with biochemically confirmed XLI was ascertained in the dermatology clinic. The available patient medical records, skin histopathology, and photographs were evaluated and a literature search of patients with XLI was conducted.

Results

Children whose diagnosis was made incidentally through CMA had milder skin phenotypes, including dryness or eczema, or both, and did not manifest the polygonal or "dirty" scale described as typical of XLI in the literature.

Limitations

The small sample size, limited clinical information, and assessment by nondermatologists in a subset of cases may have influenced the results.

Conclusion

STS deletions may cause a milder skin phenotype than the typical presentation of XLI.

### Simulation of ICD-9 to ICD-10-CM transition for family medicine: simple or convoluted? [^3f7280a1]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to examine the impact of the transition from International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), to Interactional Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM), on family medicine and to identify areas where additional training might be required.

Methods

Family medicine ICD-9-CM codes were obtained from an Illinois Medicaid data set (113,000 patient visits and $5.5 million in claims). Using the science of networks, we evaluated each ICD-9-CM code used by family medicine physicians to determine whether the transition was simple or convoluted. A simple transition is defined as 1 ICD-9-CM code mapping to 1 ICD-10-CM code, or 1 ICD-9-CM code mapping to multiple ICD-10-CM codes. A convoluted transition is where the transitions between coding systems is nonreciprocal and complex, with multiple codes for which definitions become intertwined. Three family medicine physicians evaluated the most frequently encountered complex mappings for clinical accuracy.

Results

Of the 1635 diagnosis codes used by family medicine physicians, 70% of the codes were categorized as simple, 27% of codes were convoluted, and 3% had no mapping. For the visits, 75%, 24%, and 1% corresponded with simple, convoluted, and no mapping, respectively. Payment for submitted claims was similarly aligned. Of the frequently encountered convoluted codes, 3 diagnosis codes were clinically incorrect, but they represent only < 0.1% of the overall diagnosis codes.

Conclusions

The transition to ICD-10-CM is simple for 70% or more of diagnosis codes, visits, and reimbursement for a family medicine physician. However, some frequently used codes for disease management are convoluted and incorrect, and for which additional resources need to be invested to ensure a successful transition to ICD-10-CM.

Standardized code sets — HIPAA mandate and ICD-10 governance in the United States — are described as follows: Under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services mandates use of standardized code sets in support of electronic health care transactions, which include International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10); Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS); Current Procedural Terminology (CPT); National Drug Codes (NDCs); and Current Dental Terminology. The World Health Organization created the ICD-10 with adaptability for expansion and specificity for enhanced measurement, surveillance, research, and reporting across multiple domains, and it was clinically modified and initiated in the United States on October 1, 2015. The 4 cooperating parties that oversee and manage the ICD-10 in the United States are the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the National Center for Health Statistics at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Health Information Management Association, and the American Hospital Association.
