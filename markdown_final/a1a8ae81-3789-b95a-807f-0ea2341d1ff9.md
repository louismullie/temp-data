## Question

small punctate area high signal involving white matter

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about a small punctate high-signal white matter lesion on MRI, including what it represents, how to interpret it, and what to do next. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the imaging descriptors and what sequences best characterize the lesion. Then, I should verify the most likely etiologies by age and pattern. Next, I will review red flags that change pretest probabilities. After that, I need to check the clinical significance and prognosis, including progression risk. Finally, I will outline a practical, risk-stratified management plan and summarize the key takeaways with appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the imaging descriptors and why they matter. "Small punctate" implies a lesion under about 3 mm, and "high signal" on T2 or FLAIR with variable T1 behavior is the canonical appearance of white matter hyperintensities, which are best appreciated on FLAIR and can be graded with the Fazekas scale to standardize severity and confluence, especially when assessing progression risk over time [^debba1fb] [^f2d6c2af].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiology without anchoring on age. In adults, punctate WMHs are most often due to cerebral small vessel disease related to hypertension, diabetes, and aging, with a dose-dependent association to stroke, dementia, and mortality; in children, punctate lesions are more commonly developmental, demyelinating, infectious, or related to genetic/metabolic disorders, so the same MRI descriptor carries different implications by age group [^7b2cf286] [^c598c0e0] [^7a996766].

> I will now examine the adult context more closely. Punctate WMHs are very common with aging and vascular risk, and their prevalence rises from roughly 20–50% in midlife to over 90% in advanced age; importantly, punctate lesions tend to be nonprogressive, whereas early confluent and confluent lesions progress and carry higher clinical risk, so baseline morphology predicts future burden and outcomes [^f7213c7d] [^bd7bba8a]. Wait, let me verify the prognostic data: yes, the Austrian Stroke Prevention Study showed that punctate lesions had a low tendency for progression, whereas confluent lesions increased substantially over 6 years, reinforcing the benign nature of truly punctate disease in many adults [^bd7bba8a].

> Next, I should review pediatric considerations. In neonates and infants, punctate white matter lesions can reflect hemorrhage, ischemia, or early gliosis, and susceptibility-weighted imaging helps distinguish hemorrhagic from non-hemorrhagic etiologies; in older children, demyelinating disease, infectious or post-infectious processes, and genetic leukodystrophies enter the differential, so MRI pattern recognition plus clinical context is essential [^e77fc0e5] [^7a996766]. Let me consider expected evolution in some pediatric entities: in neurofibromatosis type 1, focal T2 hyperintensities are common, typically peak around age 7, and often regress by adolescence, which can prevent unnecessary alarm if recognized correctly [^bc3a25d2].

> But wait, what if the "punctate" descriptor is misleading and the lesion is actually a perivascular space or a microbleed. I should double-check morphology and adjunct sequences: perivascular spaces follow CSF signal on all sequences and are typically under 3 mm, whereas microbleeds are hypointense on T2✱ or SWI and can accompany small vessel disease; recognizing these mimics prevents misclassification of WMHs and refines risk stratification [^da8a82b0] [^c5009505]. Hold on, I should verify that SWI can indeed unmask hemorrhagic components missed on conventional T1/T2; yes, SWI meaningfully increases detection of microhemorrhage and can reshape the differential in both adults and neonates [^6bcdcaa8] [^e77fc0e5].

> I need to ensure I account for red flags that shift pretest probabilities. Diffusion restriction in a punctate lesion suggests acute ischemia or an active demyelinating/inflammatory process, so DWI changes materially alter urgency and workup; enhancement patterns, callosal involvement, and leptomeningeal disease can point toward entities like Susac syndrome or PML rather than benign small vessel disease, warranting targeted testing and sometimes biopsy [^4efb0633] [^8663296b]. Let me reconsider: if DWI is positive in multiple vascular territories, I should escalate evaluation for vasculitis or embolic sources rather than attributing to chronic SVD alone [^4efb0633] [^409146c9].

> Next, I should review clinical significance and prognosis. In adults, even incidental WMHs predict higher risks of stroke, dementia, and death, with pooled hazard ratios around 3.3 for stroke, 1.9 for dementia, and 2.0 for mortality, though these are population-level risks and should be contextualized with vascular risk profiles; in children, the clinical impact is highly etiology-dependent, with some punctate lesions resolving or remaining stable without sequelae, while others herald progressive disease [^7b2cf286] [^7a996766]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought punctate lesions might uniformly predict cognitive decline, but I should correct that: while WMH burden correlates with executive dysfunction, punctate lesions alone often have minimal or uncertain clinical impact, especially when nonprogressive, so I should avoid overattributing symptoms to small, stable punctate foci [^7b2cf286] [^bd7bba8a].

> I will now translate this into a practical management approach. For an adult with a solitary or few punctate WMHs and no symptoms, I should screen for hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, smoking, and atrial fibrillation, then optimize vascular risk reduction; if there are multiple punctate lesions or confluence, I should intensify risk factor modification and consider antihypertensive strategies shown to slow WMH progression in stroke cohorts, while acknowledging that punctate lesions themselves may not regress [^3f356139] [^40452f05]. For a child, I should align follow-up with the suspected etiology: observe and reassess if developmental or NF1-related, pursue demyelination workup if clinically indicated, and consider metabolic or genetic testing if there are systemic clues or progressive white matter changes on serial imaging [^7a996766] [^bc3a25d2].

> Let me first confirm the role of advanced imaging when the story is atypical. If DWI shows restriction, if there is enhancement, if the distribution is callosal or juxtacortical, or if there are concurrent microbleeds or enlarged perivascular spaces, I should add targeted sequences such as SWI, post-contrast T1, MR venography, or even vessel wall imaging to refine the differential and guide therapy, because these features distinguish SVD from demyelination, vasculitis, or infectious etiologies [^4efb0633] [^e880af6b] [^c5009505]. Hold on, I should verify that SWI adds value beyond GRE for microbleeds; yes, SWI improves detection of small hemorrhagic components and can reveal vessel-cluster signs in SVD, which may inform pathophysiology and risk [^6bcdcaa8] [^13f7e333].

> In summary, I need to ensure the interpretation remains anchored to age, pattern, and evolution. A small punctate high-signal white matter lesion is most often a benign manifestation of cerebral small vessel disease in adults, especially if truly punctate and nonprogressive, yet it remains a marker of cerebrovascular risk that warrants risk factor optimization; in children, punctate lesions are more heterogeneous and demand clinical correlation and, when indicated, etiologic workup and longitudinal follow-up to distinguish self-limited from progressive disease [^7b2cf286] [^7a996766]. I should double-check that my counseling reflects both the low progression risk of isolated punctate lesions and the population-level associations with stroke and dementia, so patients receive balanced, actionable guidance rather than reassurance or alarmism [^bd7bba8a] [^7b2cf286].

A small punctate high-signal area in the white matter on MRI is most often a **benign, non-specific finding** related to chronic small vessel ischemia or demyelination, especially in older adults or those with vascular risk factors [^d99b655d] [^c598c0e0]. It can also represent **early demyelination** (e.g. multiple sclerosis) in younger patients, or small hemorrhagic or infectious lesions in specific contexts [^f1784181] [^6bcdcaa8] [^8663296b]. Clinical correlation is essential: assess for vascular risk factors, neurological symptoms, and age-appropriate differentials. Most punctate lesions are stable and require no urgent action beyond risk-factor management, but new, multiple, or symptomatic lesions may need further workup with contrast MRI, DWI, or laboratory testing [^bd7bba8a] [^3f356139].

## Common etiologies and clinical significance

| **Etiology** | **Clinical significance** | **Typical patient profile** |
|-|-|-|
| Chronic small vessel ischemia | Common, benign, age-related; associated with hypertension, diabetes, and aging | Older adults with vascular risk factors [^d99b655d] [^c598c0e0] |
| Demyelinating diseases (e.g. multiple sclerosis) | Early indicator of demyelination; may be clinically silent or precede symptoms | Younger adults; may have other MS lesions or oligoclonal bands [^f1784181] |
| Small hemorrhagic lesions (microbleeds) | Often silent; associated with hypertension, amyloid angiopathy, or trauma | Older adults with hypertension or trauma history [^6bcdcaa8] [^c268f54d] |
| Infectious or inflammatory lesions (e.g. HIV, Lyme disease) | Rare; usually accompanied by other clinical or laboratory findings | Immunocompromised or specific exposure history [^8663296b] [^fb57d009] |

## Imaging characteristics and differentiation

- **T2/FLAIR hyperintensity**: Indicates increased water content (edema, demyelination, or gliosis) [^d99b655d].
- **T1 hypointensity**: Suggests chronic ischemia or demyelination [^d99b655d].
- **Diffusion restriction (DWI)**: Indicates acute ischemia or active demyelination [^bb681839].
- **Contrast enhancement**: Suggests active inflammation, infection, or neoplasm [^notfound].

---

## Clinical evaluation and management

- **Clinical correlation**: Assess for neurological symptoms, vascular risk factors, and age-appropriate differentials (e.g. demyelination, infection) [^c9a1b583].
- **Risk factor management**: Optimize blood pressure, glucose, and lipid control; smoking cessation [^3f356139].
- **Further imaging**: Contrast MRI, DWI, or follow-up MRI if lesions are new, multiple, or symptomatic [^bb681839].
- **Laboratory testing**: Consider if infectious, inflammatory, or demyelinating disease is suspected (e.g. HIV, Lyme, oligoclonal bands) [^8663296b] [^f1784181].

---

## Prognosis

Most punctate lesions are **stable and benign**, especially when due to chronic small vessel ischemia [^bd7bba8a]. Progression to confluent lesions or clinical symptoms is more likely with multiple lesions, vascular risk factors, or active demyelinating disease [^bd7bba8a] [^c598c0e0].

---

A small punctate high-signal white matter lesion is usually a **benign, non-specific** finding, but clinical context and imaging features guide whether further evaluation is needed.

Diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) has already had a substantial effect on the diagnosis of patients with ischaemic stroke. It provides in vivo pathological information and allows the differentiation of acute stroke from chronic stroke and from non-specific white-matter lesions. The high contrast of the acute DWI lesion against the dark background facilitates the detection of lesions even when they are 1 mm or less in diameter. Small lesions, which are undetectable by other means, include small lacunar infarcts, punctate cortical infarcts, and DWI bright dots in patients with transient ischaemic attacks (TIA). The latter constitute remnants or "footprints" of recent ischaemia and confirm the clinical TIA syndrome as ischaemic. Because of these attributes, DWI not only confirms the clinical diagnosis, but also facilitates the recognition of certain patterns of ischaemia, thereby providing clues to the underlying aetiology. DWI is becoming an important technique for optimum management of patients.

### A pattern approach to focal white matter hyperintensities on magnetic resonance imaging [^c9a1b583]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Evaluation of focal white matter hyperintensities on magnetic resonance imaging in any age group is always challenging because the cause of these hyperintensities varies extensively. Understanding the clinical presentation, pathophysiology, and associated imaging findings can allow the radiologist to limit the differential diagnosis. A specific imaging approach including age, pattern of distribution, signal characteristics on various sequences, enhancement pattern, and other ancillary findings helps to identify a correct cause for these hyperintensities. This article provides a pattern approach to differentiate various common and a few uncommon diseases presenting as focal white matter hyperintensities.

1.1.2 Lesions load and localization

Apparent lesions can have different etiologies depending on their shape and location, and therefore different predictive clinical importance (Lampe et al.). Periventricular (PVWM) lesions and deep‐white matter lesions (DWM), which have varying effects on cognition and arterial pressure, may be entirely different entities (Griffanti et al.). Small, irregular patches may be a sign of ischemia, whereas larger, smoother periventricular lesions may simply be a benign symptom of aging. Small punctate lesions may eventually develop into pathologies, but their role still needs to be clarified (Prins & Scheltens). Local features of the vasculature may also have an impact (Debette et al.). Overall, to date, the etiology of WMH is still largely unknown, and existing classification scales partly reflect this (van Straaten et al.).

In the computational domain, consequently, an identification algorithm should not rely solely on blindly aggregated metrics such as total voxel overlap as its unique objective, or it will risk missing this distinction and would become biased toward large patches, ignoring the low voxel contributions of punctate lesions and leading to suboptimal clinical predictive power.

1.1.3 Sequence and resolution

FLAIR is one of the optimal sequences for observing WMH, but 3D FLAIR sequences with high SNR are not yet widespread in hospital settings. Two‐dimensional FLAIR sequences are easier to obtain but suffer from poor resolution along the slice axis, which not only reduces accuracy in that dimension but also introduces a source of mismatch for longitudinal comparisons.

Alternatively, lesion‐induced WMHs are visible on T1 weighted images in most cases, where they appear as hypointense regions (and the acronym WMH will refer to both contrast signals from now on). It is common to use the T1‐weighted contrast for structural, high‐resolution images of the brain, for example, to allow accurate estimates of ventricle enlargement or hippocampal volume or atrophy (Nogovitsyn et al; Thyreau et al.). Therefore, it is useful to obtain WMH delineation directly from regular 3D T1 images.

However, in a major difference from FLAIR, lesions‐induced WMH on T1 images appear with the same signal intensity as gray‐matter structures and would require considerably more attention from an investigator to confidently identify them by visual inspection, particularly for infra‐cortical lesions. This, however, can be accomplished using moderns algorithms.

### Magnetic resonance imaging white matter lesions and cognitive impairment in hypertensive individuals… [^ba6570c4]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

- To search for a morphologic basis of cognitive impairment possibly associated with essential hypertension, we studied 35 otherwise asymptomatic hypertensive individuals and 20 normotensive control subjects using neuropsychologic tests and magnetic resonance imaging. Irrespective of drug treatment, hypertensive individuals performed significantly worse than did control subjects when assessed for verbal memory and total learning and memory capacity, while there were no differences in test results of visual memory, attention, vigilance, and reaction time. The hypertensive individuals also described themselves as less active but ranked similar on five other mood subscales. Punctate high-signal intensities of the white matter were found almost twice as often in the hypertensive group as in the control group.

There was no difference in test performance between hypertensive individuals with and those without white matter lesions, however. Our results confirm the presence of subtle neuropsychologic deficits and indicate a higher frequency of white matter signal abnormalities in essential hypertension, as shown on magnetic resonance imaging, but do not indicate a correlation of these findings with each other.

### Heterogeneity in age-related white matter changes [^b036fcc1]. Acta Neuropathologica (2011). Low credibility.

White matter changes occur endemically in routine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of elderly persons. MRI appearance and histopathological correlates of white matter changes are heterogeneous. Smooth periventricular hyperintensities, including caps around the ventricular horns, periventricular lining and halos are likely to be of non-vascular origin. They relate to a disruption of the ependymal lining with subependymal widening of the extracellular space and have to be differentiated from subcortical and deep white matter abnormalities. For the latter a distinction needs to be made between punctate, early confluent and confluent types. Although punctate white matter lesions often represent widened perivascular spaces without substantial ischemic tissue damage, early confluent and confluent lesions correspond to incomplete ischemic destruction. Punctate abnormalities on MRI show a low tendency for progression, while early confluent and confluent changes progress rapidly. The causative and modifying pathways involved in the occurrence of sporadic age-related white matter changes are still incompletely understood, but recent microarray and genome-wide association approaches increased the notion of pathways that might be considered as targets for therapeutic intervention. The majority of differentially regulated transcripts in white matter lesions encode genes associated with immune function, cell cycle, proteolysis, and ion transport. Genome-wide association studies identified six SNPs mapping to a locus on chromosome 17q25 to be related to white matter lesion load in the general population. We also report first and preliminary data that demonstrate apolipoprotein E (ApoE) immunoreactivity in white matter lesions and support epidemiological findings indicating that ApoE is another factor possibly related to white matter lesion occurrence. Further insights come from modern MRI techniques, such as diffusion tensor and magnetization transfer imaging, as they provide tools for the characterization of normal-appearing brain tissue beyond what can be expected from standard MRI scans. There is a need for additional pre- and postmortem studies in humans, including these new imaging techniques.

### Susceptibility-weighted imaging of intravascular lymphoma of the central nervous system… [^6bcdcaa8]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Patient 1 had numerous punctate to small clusters of microhemorrhages primarily located within the bilateral cerebral hemispheric subcortical white matter. Patient 2 had focal isolated gyriform microhemorrhage within the left parietal cortex. Patient 3 had a few foci of gyriform microhemorrhage within the right frontal cortices and scattered punctate microhemorrhage in the left frontal subcortical white matter. Patient 4 had scattered foci of gyriform microhemorrhage in bilateral cerebral cortices. Patient 5 had several punctate foci of microhemorrhage, some associated with T2 hyperintense lesions. Patient 6 had a large lobar macrohemorrhage in the left parietal lobe and several scattered microhemorrhage within the right cerebral hemisphere. Abnormal susceptibility was seen in all patients, occurring in both supratentorial and infratentorial gray and white matter, often punctate or gyriform, inconsistently associated with T2 hyperintensity and/or reduced diffusion.

Abnormal susceptibility ranged in appearance and severity, from innumerable subcortical microhemorrhages, lobar macrohemorrhage, and a few punctate foci of microhemorrhage on SWI not appreciable on subsequent gradient echo sequences T2✱-weighted imaging. All patients demonstrated abnormal white matter T2 or FLAIR hyperintensities. Five patients demonstrated reduced diffusion, predominantly in small-vessel patterns. Four showed abnormal enhancements, often subtle, parenchymal, and involving gray or white matter. Among 6 patients with biopsy-proven CNS IVL, all patients had abnormal susceptibility identified on SWI and abnormal white matter hyperintensities on T2 or FLAIR. Other MRI sequences less consistently demonstrated abnormalities. Abnormal SWI findings in patients with CNS IVL are not well characterized, and associations have been limited to single-case reports.

### White matter hyperintensities, cognitive impairment and dementia: an update [^c598c0e0]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2015). Medium credibility.

White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) in the brain are the consequence of cerebral small vessel disease, and can easily be detected on MRI. Over the past three decades, research has shown that the presence and extent of white matter hyperintense signals on MRI are important for clinical outcome, in terms of cognitive and functional impairment. Large, longitudinal population-based and hospital-based studies have confirmed a dose-dependent relationship between WMHs and clinical outcome, and have demonstrated a causal link between large confluent WMHs and dementia and disability. Adequate differential diagnostic assessment and management is of the utmost importance in any patient, but most notably those with incipient cognitive impairment. Novel imaging techniques such as diffusion tensor imaging might reveal subtle damage before it is visible on standard MRI. Even in Alzheimer disease, which is thought to be primarily caused by amyloid, vascular pathology, such as small vessel disease, may be of greater importance than amyloid itself in terms of influencing the disease course, especially in older individuals. Modification of risk factors for small vessel disease could be an important therapeutic goal, although evidence for effective interventions is still lacking. Here, we provide a timely Review on WMHs, including their relationship with cognitive decline and dementia.

### White matter hyperintensities: complex predictor of complex outcomes [^f7213c7d]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) pose an enigma in evaluations of brain health and disease. The prevalence of WMH has been estimated to reach 20% to 50% in the general population in midlife, increasing to > 90% with advanced age. Although WMHs can result from a plethora of molecular and cellular abnormalities, they are commonly considered a consequence of cerebral small‐vessel disease (cSVD) in the aging brain, frequently associated with hypertension. Despite associations of WMHs with upstream risk factors, what lays beneath the surface of this radiographic marker of abnormality is thought to be multifactorial in the aging brain, and an active area of research.

More important, numerous observations of WMH get classified as "incidental" on clinical reads, a label that is reserved for findings observed and considered as unrelated to the primary reason for which the imaging is ordered. There are several assumptions underpinning this classification. First, incidental insinuates that WMH is "benign" and may not matter to risk stratification for the disease under investigation, often neurodegenerative in nature. Second, incidental further underscores the assumption that brain dysfunction is neurocentric. These assumptions persist in part because cSVD does not have a specific clinical syndrome for which studies get ordered. In addition, although studies have repeatedly demonstrated an association between burden of WMH and cognitive impairment and stroke, the strength of associations has suggested limited value in adding WMH to predictive models, above and beyond cardiovascular risk and disease.

### Practical approach to the diagnosis of adult-onset leukodystrophies: an updated guide in the genomic era [^ad13b1c9]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

The MRI appearance of HDLS is consistent, with typical features including confluent, largely symmetric T2 hyperintense/T1 hypointense signal abnormality in the frontoparietal and periventricular white matter, which spares the U-fibres, and involves the pyramidal tracts and corpus callosum. Punctate areas of restricted diffusion may be present (termed deep white matter diffusion dots) and their appearance may even mimic CNS vasculitis. Calcifications may be present, particularly in the periventricular white matter adjacent to the frontal horns (figure 1D–F).

It was shown in 2011 that HDLS is largely caused by mutations in the CSF1R gene. Almost all mutations are found in the tyrosine kinase domain of the CSF1R protein and the majority of mutations are missense. A small number of splice site, frameshift and indel mutations have also been identified.

### Punctate white matter lesions in infants: new insights using susceptibility-weighted imaging [^d0debcb9]. Neuroradiology (2011). Low credibility.

Diffusion-weighted image at early MRI showed restricted diffusion in some PWML in this study. Although the etiology of PWML have not been well-established, it is possible that these lesions represent heterogeneous pathology. Some lesions may be related to venous congestion representing small venous infarction with hemorrhage, whereas others may be related to regions of infarction or increased cellularity resulting in gliosis.

In this study, SWI showed various percentage of signal loss in PWML, suggesting various amounts of hemorrhagic components in PWML. Although the nature of these PWML has not been fully explored, SWI can be a very sensitive method to discriminate hemorrhage from other conditions associated with hypersignal on T1-weighted imaging. Acquisition of SWI was accelerated by EPI, yielding a scan time of < 3 min for SWI in the current study. Therefore, SWI can be considered as an acceptable additional sequence in infants, which is not time consuming and will provide additional information with regard to ruling out or confirming hemorrhage in lesions with abnormal signal on conventional MRI.

There are several limitations to this study. In the present study, we did not compare SWI findings on 1.5- or 3.0-T systems, which may differ. We aimed to identify all white matter lesions, but small lesions (e.g. smaller than 0.5 mm) could not be reliably identified. Comparison of T1-weighted (or IR) imaging and SWI may be difficult in very small (e.g. smaller than 1 mm) lesions. On the other hand, counting PWML was also difficult in two cases with diffuse white matter hypersignal on T1-weighted image (cases 7 and 23). Because of the magnetic susceptibility effect, signal loss indicating hemorrhage on SWI appears to be bigger, compared to the actual hypersignal area on T1-weighted image. Although we considered signal loss larger than the surrounding veins as hemorrhage, complete discrimination between dilated veins and foci of hemorrhage was difficult in cases 7–9. Furthermore, more histopathological studies would be welcome. Another limitation of this study was the relatively small sample size. Follow-up of the infants studied is in progress, and it will be of interest to see whether there is a difference in outcome in those with or without a low signal on SWI within the PWML. Assessment of the prognostic value of SWI using a larger sample size will be of interest.

### White matter injury and outcomes: what is the final verdict? [^e303fec2]. Pediatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Historically DEHSI on T2-weighted MR imaging in preterm neonates was first reported by Maalouf et al. in 2001. Since then, many of the studies examining the significance of DEHSI were in preterm infants, with the understanding that the white matter of the preterm brain is subject to selective vulnerability and high risk for injury. Over time the definition of DEHSI has broadened to involve any visually apparent high T2 signal intensity in any area of the white matter, but the diagnosis remains subjective and subject to inter-rater variability. The significance of DEHSI to long term neurodevelopmental outcomes in premature infants has been debated with many studies finding no significant correlation, – but with other studies suggesting association with neuropathology and neurodevelopmental outcomes. The significance of DEHSI in term infants with neonatal encephalopathy remains poorly understood.

Limitations acknowledged by the authors include lack of standardization of magnet strength in the MRI scanners and the need for neurodevelopmental follow up out to school age. Another important limitation is that the Kidokoro score was adapted from its intended use as it was validated and designed to assees preterm brain injury at term equivalent age.

Alternate MRI Scores developed specifically for the evaluation of infants with NE or hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) include the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Neonatal Research Network (NICHD NRN) scoreand the Weeke score. Both scores are validated with long term outcomes and allow for the evaluation of signal abnormalities in the basal ganglia, thalamus, and white matter. In addition, the Trivedi score includes evaluation of diffusion weighted imaging but is weighted more specifically for deep nuclear gray matter and posterior limb of the internal capsule (PLIC) injuries. These scores are all intended to be global injury severity scores and in comparison, the Kidokoro T2 hyperintensity/DEHSI score may allow for more discrete stratification of injury severity specific to this injury pattern. Application of the Kidokoro T2 hyperintensity score are needed to validate the tool in future cohorts of HIE. Additionally, false negative study findings are possible in this small Canadian cohort since no power analysis is presented, and the applicability to other cohorts with different socioeconomic and ethnicities remains unknown. We have reported in a large county hospital predominantly underserved Hispanic minorities that even a low NICHD MRI score, showing evidence of focal white matter injury (1a) was associated with cognitive deficits at 24 months of age in about 70% of patients.

### Punctate white matter lesions in infants: new insights using susceptibility-weighted imaging [^e77fc0e5]. Neuroradiology (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Punctate white matter lesions (PWML) are recognized with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as hypersignal on T1-weighted imaging and hyposignal on T2-weighted imaging. Our aim was to assess how often a hemorrhagic component was present in PWML using susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI).

Methods

Seventeen preterm (gestational age, 25–34 weeks) and seven full-term infants (age at MRI, 37–42 weeks) with PWML were included. Seven preterm infants had sequential MRIs. PWML were diagnosed with conventional MRI and compared with SWI, where signal loss is suggestive of hemorrhage. The pattern of associated brain lesions was taken into account, and the percentage of lesions with signal loss on SWI was calculated for each infant.

Results

A significantly higher percentage of signal loss on SWI (median, 93.9%) was found among infants with germinal matrix and intraventricular hemorrhage as the primary diagnosis (n = 8) compared to those with a primary diagnosis of white matter injury (n = 14; median, 14.2%; p < 0.01). In the infants with serial MRIs, a reduction in the number of PWML and/or signal loss on SWI was noted at term equivalent age. In the patient who died, cystic lesions, associated with hemorrhage and gliosis, were demonstrated on histology.

Conclusions

SWI can distinguish hemorrhagic and non-hemorrhagic PWML. Signal loss on SWI was more common when PWML were associated with an intraventricular hemorrhage. Longitudinal imaging showed a decrease in the number of PWML over time, with some PWML no longer showing signal loss on SWI, suggesting early gliosis.

Limitations of Imaging Approaches to Determining WMH Pathophysiology

MRI processing methods for WMH detection and differentiation from artifacts, co-registration of different types of images, and image processing methods such as bias field correction, affect measurements of lesions and brain tissue parameters. The full analysis of these limitations is beyond the remit of this paper, but these limitations are important but rarely mentioned in imaging papers so are discussed briefly here for completeness. Indeed the full scope of the effects of these limitations is only just beginning to be understood by the clinical research community.

Methods to quantify WMH volume are evolving rapidly. Many were developed for use in one study, reflect the particular subject, image acquisition characteristics and WMH burden of that study population. Few, if any, are in use in clinical practice. Many research groups develop their scanning protocol and WMH segmentation approach and apply it to subsequent studies, without further validation. The protocol may not be changed or improved partly due to lack of availability of source codes and/or software and because of a natural desire to minimize the effect of protocol changes on measured variables. Most studies use a semi-automatic thresholding approach to identify WMH on FLAIR images. These threshold selection methods may then be applied in different studies assuming that the reliability will not change, which is unlikely to be correct as FLAIR images are not quantitative and the signal to noise ratio may not be the same. Thresholding on a single image such as FLAIR requires individualized thresholds ("one size" does not "fit all cases"); multispectral approaches using several sequences combined are more accurate. A full description of the WMH volume measurement methods used in different studies to date is beyond the scope of this paper but is available upon request.

### Genetics of age-related white matter lesions from linkage to genome wide association studies [^0259fbeb]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2012). Low credibility.

1 Introduction

White matter lesions (WML) occur at high frequencies in routine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of elderly persons. In population-based studies the prevalence of any WML varies between 45% and 95%. Depending on the composition of the investigated cohorts 12 to 33% of subjects have severe changes. According to location patterns WML can be separated in perventricular and deep/subcortical abnormalities (Fig. 1).

Pathological correlations demonstrated that this nosological distinction reflects etiological differences. Table 1 summarizes the findings of previous histopathological correlations.

As can be seen from this table periventricular hyperintensities including caps around the ventricular horns, periventricular lining and halos are likely to be of non-vascular origin while deep and subcortical WML are often ischemic lesions and there exists a continuum in severity ranging from punctuate to early confluent and confluent changes. Punctate lesions often represent widened perivascular spaces only. By contrast, early confluent and confluent abnormalities correspond to incomplete ischemic tissue destruction including demyelination, axonal degeneration, gliosis and focal transitions to true infarctions. Early confluent and confluent changes progress rapidly over timeand these lesion types often lead to clinical consequences including cognitive decline, depression, gait disturbances, and urinary incontinence. The LADIS study has shown that early confluent and confluent WML are also important predictors of disability.

The genetic raw model for cerebral small vessel disease is Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL). CADASIL has been reported in more than 500 families worldwide. The west of Scotland registry estimated the prevalence of NOTCH3 gene mutations, which are responsible for the disease, to be 4.14 per 100 000 subjects in the general population. The MRI abnormalities seen in CADASIL patients are strikingly similar to changes seen in sporadic small vessel disease. MRI changes in CADASIL precede the onset of other symptoms by 10–15 years. The earliest and most frequent abnormalities are WML. Just like in age-related WML CADASIL white matter abnormalities first appear as punctuate changes often in periventricular areas and later become more diffuse, mostly symmetrical. Involvement of the external capsule is less frequent in age-related white matter diseases, but the most distinguishing MRI finding in CADASIL is the involvement of the anterior part of the temporal lobes.

### Invited article: an MRI-based approach to the diagnosis of white matter disorders [^6135aa36]. Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

There are many different white matter disorders, both inherited and acquired, and consequently the diagnostic process is difficult. Establishing a specific diagnosis is often delayed at great emotional and financial costs. The pattern of brain structures involved, as visualized by MRI, has proven to often have a high diagnostic specificity.

Methods

We developed a comprehensive practical algorithm that relies mainly on the characteristics of brain MRI.

Results

The initial decision point defines a hypomyelination pattern, in which the cerebral white matter is hyperintense (normal), isointense, or slightly hypointense relative to the cortex on T1-weighted images, vs other pathologies with more prominent hypointensity of the cerebral white matter on T1-weighted images. In all types of pathology, the affected white matter is hyperintense on T2-weighted images, but, as a rule, the T2 hyperintensity is less marked in hypomyelination than in other pathologies. Some hypomyelinating disorders are typically associated with peripheral nerve involvement, while others are not. Lesions in patients with pathologies other than hypomyelination can be either confluent or isolated and multifocal. Among the diseases with confluent lesions, the distribution of the abnormalities is of high diagnostic value. Additional MRI features, such as white matter rarefaction, the presence of cysts, contrast enhancement, and the presence of calcifications, further narrow the diagnostic possibilities.

Conclusion

Application of a systematic decision tree in MRI of white matter disorders facilitates the diagnosis of specific etiologic entities.

### Punctate white matter abnormality in moderate-to-late preterm infants [^4ea8f567]. Annals of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Previous assessments of WMA in MLP infants have been at TEA or later, with reported rates of 2 to 15%, and a recent investigation in 500 healthy full term infants reported WMI in 12%. In contrast, we found 36.7% of MLP infants had WMA identified on early‐life scan, which is surprisingly similar to reported rates of WMI in VP infants. The previous studies in MLP infants used serial cranial ultrasound and/or MRI at TEA or later, whereas the peak vulnerability to punctate WMI in neonatal brain occurs before TEA. Some studies either did not examine T1‐weighted images, or with lower resolution. Small lesions are hard to identify because of partial volume effect with large voxel. We measured WMA at both early‐life when the neonatal brain is more susceptible to WMA and again at TEA on high resolution T1‐weighted images (1mm 3). Importantly, most of the WMA that we found on early‐life scans were much harder to detect on scans acquired at TEA, and may have been missed without knowledge of the findings from earlier scans. Consistent with this, we found a significant decrease in WMA volume from first to second scan, although a small number of infants had minimal increased WMA in the occipital region. In comparison with the majority of infants without increased occipital WMA, this group had greater total WMA volume. The worsening occipital WMA from early‐life to TEA in some babies may reflect ongoing vulnerability of pre‐oligodendrocytes in the context of maturation arrest. Our findings suggest that much of the burden of WMA in MLP infants occurs before or very soon after birth and may be underestimated when scanning takes place only around TEA.

Acute viral encephalitis/encephalopathy is a medical emergency. Prompt introduction of treatment has a significant influence on survival and the extent of permanent brain injury. Differentiation between infectious and noninfectious central nervous system involvement is paramount. Neuroimaging provides many clues for the specific diagnosis.

In conclusion, SWI helps in distinguishing hemorrhagic from non-hemorrhagic PWML. Hemorrhagic PWML are more commonly associated with an intraventricular hemorrhage in the preterm infant, suggesting venous obstruction, while non-hemorrhagic PWML is mainly seen in infants with primarily (subtle) white matter injury, suggesting ischemic or early gliotic lesions. Longitudinal imaging showed a decrease in the number of PWML over time, whereas some PWML became non-hemorrhagic.

Introduction

With the increasing use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), hemorrhagic and hypoxic–ischemic lesions are often diagnosed during the neonatal period. Punctate white matter lesions (PWML) are a common finding in preterm infants. PWML can be recognized on MR images in the unmyelinated white matter as hypersignal on T1-weighted imaging and hyposignal on T2-weighted imaging. These signal intensity changes can be compatible with either petechial hemorrhages, gliotic scarring, or mineralization, which are impossible to distinguish on T1- and T2-weighted images. Most preterm infants with these PWML survive, and detailed data on postmortem histology are scarce. Histology has demonstrated that petechial hemorrhages are seen in about 25% of infants with white matter lesions. More recently, it has been shown that white matter injury does not occur exclusively in preterm infants, and attention has especially been drawn to full-term infants with congenital heart defects undergoing surgery in the neonatal period.

Susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) has recently been developed for clinical use. This sequence is very sensitive to detect susceptibility changes such as blood, iron, calcification, and air. SWI uses a high-spatial resolution, three-dimensional, fast low-angle shot MRI technique with postprocessing with multiplying phase data. Recent studies have shown that SWI is superior to gradient echo sequence or CT in detecting hemorrhage. Detection of hemorrhagic components is useful and will help to understand the neuropathological conditions underlying the signal intensity changes seen on MRI.

The aim of this study was to assess whether SWI can help to make a distinction between hemorrhagic and ischemic PWML, seen on MRI in the neonatal period. In addition, the evolution of these lesions was assessed in a subgroup of infants examined sequentially.

### Imaging biomarkers of dementia: recommended visual rating scales with teaching cases [^f2d6c2af]. Insights Into Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

White matter changes – Fazekas' scale

The Fazekas' scale was first constructed in 1987 in order to standardize the visual assessment of white matter changes seen on MRI. The scale has been used in a large number of publications on white matter changes and is included here because of its simplicity and applicability on CT and MRI, and we consequently recommend its use in the clinical dementia assessment. The Fazekas' scale includes assessment on axial T2-weighted or T2 FLAIR images for the whole brain and has four increments. Caps and bands, a rim of white matter hyperintensity around the ventricles, are seen as a normal finding in the brain. Grade 0 has no or occasional punctate white matter changes and grade 1 has multiple punctate white matter changes, which can be seen in all ages and is common in patients older than 65 years of age. The presence of a small number of such changes usually lack clinical significance. Grade 2 implies incipient confluence or bridging of punctate changes and grade 3 consists of confluent white matter changes. Grade 2 is regarded as pathological in patients younger than approximately 70 years of age, while grade 3 is always pathological (Fig. 4). A modified version of the Fazekas' scale, the age related white matter changes (ARWMC) scale includes analysis in further topographical regions.

Discussion

In this study, we were able to make a distinction between hemorrhagic and non-hemorrhagic PWML using SWI. Infants with a primary diagnosis of GMH-IVH and associated PWML, more often had areas of signal loss on SWI, suggestive of petechial hemorrhages, compared to those with a primary diagnosis of WMD. These findings would suggest that PWML were more often hemorrhagic when associated with GMH-IVH and more often ischemic in those with WMD. The reason of a higher rate of hemorrhagic components in PWML, as detected with SWI, in infants with GMH-IVH may be explained by the fact that in patients with GMH-IVH, both impaired venous drainage and elevation of the pressure in the medullary veins occur in the periventricular white matter, resulting in a higher occurrence of hemorrhage. Most hemorrhagic PWML were seen close to veins. Previous studied have reported PWML in preterm infants who had early MRI (30–32 weeks PMA) as well as in preterm infants scanned at TEA. Non-hemorrhagic PWMLs were most often considered to be due to early glial scarring or necrosis with mineralization. As most of the infants with PWML survive the neonatal period, histological data coming from postmortem studies are scarce. In our patient with hemorrhagic cystic periventricular leukomalacia, postmortem examination demonstrated early gliosis in the areas with T1-weighted abnormalities, but normal SWI. In the brain areas of T1-weighted and SWI signal loss, hemorrhages could be demonstrated using histology. These findings support the view that some of the T1-weighted abnormalities may be hemorrhages, whereas other lesions may represent early gliosis. Rutherford et al. recently reported postmortem findings in a preterm infant with punctate white matter lesion and found the PWML to correspond to areas of vascular congestion with infiltration of activated microglia. Our results support their findings.

7 DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF RHI‐WMH

There are several competing differential etiologies that could give rise to WMH including aging, multiple sclerosis, AD/ADRD, vascular risk factors, migraine, and index TBIs. RHI‐WMH are distinct from the hyperintensities with periventricular extensions (Dawson's fingers) seen in multiple sclerosis, as well as from the perivascular and often confluent (with more severe disease) lesions in aging and AD. Figure S1 in supporting information illustrates the characteristic WMH patterns seen in AD and normal aging through FLAIR MRI of one non‐RHI participant with AD dementia (male, 80–85 years) and one female participant with normal cognition (70–75 years). Age‐related WMH frequently present around the lateral ventricles. AD and ADRD can have a distinct topography that mirrors the distribution of their characteristic pathology.WMH co‐localize with atrophy and proteinopathy in AD and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD); we expect that a similar phenomenon is happening in RHI.WMH burden has also been found to be elevated in older participants with vascular risk factors, and has been associated with clinical outcomes like depression. The updated Boston criteria for the diagnosis of cerebral amyloid angiopathy has recently incorporated WM characteristics into the diagnostic criteria.WMH in cerebral amyloid angiopathy are numerous and punctate and are associated with lobar cerebral microbleeds. Punctate and non‐confluent T2 FLAIR WMH are also a consistent finding in participants with migraines. The periventricular location of these lesions and smaller overall numbers is different from RHI‐WMH. We note that post‐traumatic migraines could be quite frequent in this setting and cannot be ruled out as a differential diagnosis; however, even if migraine is the driver of these lesions, it is still potentially reflective of RHI exposure.

### Early detection of white matter hyperintensities using SHIVA-WMH detector [^8ff0fb5b]. Human Brain Mapping (2024). Medium credibility.

Although their prevalence increases with age, small and punctate WMHs have been reported with surprisingly high frequency even in young adults under 40 years of age (Keřkovský et al; Wadhwa et al; Wang et al; Williamson et al.). If they represent early forms of covert cSVD, it is crucial to investigate their emergence and progression in order to study their pathophysiological correlates as well as their association with genetic, environmental, and behavioral risk factors. Clinically, the presence and severity of WMH on MRI are most commonly assessed with visual rating scales, such as the Fazekas (Fazekas et al.) or more anatomically detailed Scheltens Scale (Scheltens et al.) and the Age‐Related White Matter Changes (ARWMC) scale (Wahlund et al.). They are all point scales expressing the severity of WMH, with grade 0 indicating no lesion and increasing grade indicating the size and/or number of the lesion, as well as the degree of confluency. While they can be effective for differentiating the most severe cases of WMH from milder cases, these clinical scales are inadequate for the characterization of subjects with the early stages of cSVD, who would at most receive a grade of 1. They also provide very limited information on the spatial extent and distribution of WMH, only distinguishing between WMH found in the periventricular region from deep white matter (for Fazekas) or different lobes in each hemisphere (for ARWMC). It is therefore essential to have automated methods to segment WMH in order to quantify and provide precise spatial information of any lesions in cohorts across the disease spectrum.

### Progression of cerebral white matter lesions: 6-year results of the Austrian stroke prevention study [^bd7bba8a]. Lancet (2003). Excellent credibility.

More than half of all elderly people have some degree of cerebral white matter lesions. However, the rate of progression of these lesions is uncertain. We aimed to assess the progression of lesions in community-dwelling volunteers aged 50–75 years without neuropsychiatric disease. We used MRI to grade and measure the total volume of white matter lesions in 296 volunteers at baseline, 3 years, and 6 years. 58 participants with no lesions and 123 with punctate abnormalities at baseline had a low tendency for lesion progression, whereas 14 participants with early confluent and nine with confluent lesions underwent median increases of 2.7 cm(3) (IQR 0.5–5.9) and 9.3 cm(3) (7.1–21.0), respectively, in lesion volume at 6 years. Lesion grade at baseline was the only significant predictor of lesion progression (p < 0.0001). Punctate white matter lesions are not progressive and are thus benign, whereas early confluent and confluent white matter abnormalities are progressive, and thus malignant.

### Florbetaben f 18 (Neuraceq) [^62519584]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Some scans may be difficult to interpret due to image noise, atrophy with a thinned cortex, or image blur. If co-registered computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR) images are available, the CT/MR images may be used to clarify the relationship of the NEURACEQ uptake and the gray matter anatomy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Negative NEURACEQ Scan

Signal intensity in gray matter is lower than in white matter in all four brain regions (no amyloid beta deposition).

A negative scan indicates sparse to no amyloid beta neuritic plaques. In patients being evaluated for AD and other causes of cognitive decline who have not been treated with amyloid beta-directed therapy, a negative scan is inconsistent with a neuropathological diagnosis of AD at the time of image acquisition and reduces the likelihood that a patient's cognitive impairment is due to AD. A negative scan result does not preclude the accumulation of amyloid beta in the brain in the future.

Positive NEURACEQ Scan

Smaller area(s) of signal intensity equal to or higher than that present in white matter extending beyond the white matter rim to the outer cortical margin involving the majority of the slices within at least one of the four brain regions ("moderate" amyloid beta deposition), or a large confluent area of signal intensity equal to or higher than that present in white matter extending beyond the white matter rim to the outer cortical margin and involving the entire region including the majority of slices within at least one of the four brain regions ("pronounced" amyloid beta deposition). There is no known clinical or histopathologic correlation distinguishing "moderate" from "pronounced" amyloid beta deposition.

### What are white matter hyperintensities made of? Relevance to vascular cognitive impairment [^dac9e596]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Artifacts that mimic WMH (to a computer algorithm) are numerous (Table 1) and require manual editing. Guidelines exist to differentiate WMH from artifacts, but these lack uniformity and consensus. Some class periventricular hyperintense thin lines around the lateral ventricles as artifact, but others found a high correlation between signal intensity levels and width of the periventricular WMH, total WMH volumes, periventricular WMH severity, vascular risk factors, and stroke, indicating that periventricular WMH are true tissue abnormalities and should not be considered artifacts.

Table 1
Common Artifacts That Confound the Identification of WMH on FLAIR MRI

Differentiating WMH from other SVD lesions such as perivascular spaces, and lacunesmay be difficult. Differences in magnet strengths can lead to inconsistent assessment of WMH, eg, subtle tissue changes in normal-appearing white matter could go unnoticed at 3 T due to noise, or vice versa (Figure 9). Reported mean intra- and inter-scanner coefficients of variation in automatic volumetric measurements of brain structures range from 0.87% to 15.1% (median 4.80%). Only limited information is available for the range of values for direct comparisons of WMH assessed at 1.5 and 3 T.

A woman in her late 20s presented with headaches and subacute encephalopathy. MRIs showed multiple punctate subcortical and periventricular white matter hyperintensities with diffusion restriction, infratentorial lesions, leptomeningeal enhancement of the cervical spinal cord, brainstem and cerebellum and two areas of high-signal abnormality at T4 and T6 raising suspicion for multiple sclerosis or acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. Further studies and evolution of her symptoms during her hospital stay confirmed the clinical triad of encephalopathy, branch retinal artery occlusions and hearing loss pathognomonic for Susac's syndrome. While cervical spinal cord and cauda equina involvement have been reported in Susac's syndrome previously, no thoracic spinal cord involvement has been reported. We report the novel MRI finding of thoracic spinal cord involvement in Susac's syndrome. In order to avoid misdiagnosis, neurologists and neuroradiologists should be aware that any part of the spinal cord can be involved in Susac's syndrome.

MRI

Image acquisition

MRI examinations were performed in all very preterm infants according to a standard protocol for imaging the newborn infant's brain, using a 3.0-T Philips MR system (Philips Medical Systems, Best, the Netherlands) as recently described. In summary, scans included at least T 1 -weighted three-dimensional images (repetition time/echo time (TR/TE) 9.7/4.6 ms), allowing reconstruction in every desired orientation, T 2 -weighted images (TR/TE 6,269/120 ms), diffusion-weighted images (TR/TE 2,406/64 ms), and susceptibility weighted images (TR/TE 735/16 ms) in the transverse plane. The MRI examinations were performed around TEA, preferably between 40- and 44-week postmenstrual age (PMA; i.e. TEA-MRI). For infants who were still unstable and/or ventilator dependent around that age, MRI was postponed. For this part of the study, the T 1 - and T 2 -weighted sequences were analyzed.
2 Visual assessment

All MRI examinations were assessed by two experienced investigators (LML with FTdB or SJS with FTdB, the latter being a pediatric neuroradiologist with > 15 years of experience), who were blinded to the cUS findings.

Special attention was paid to the brain WM. Punctate white matter lesions (PWML) were defined as small areas of high signal on T 1 -weighted images, with mostly low signal on T 2 -weighted images (Fig. 3). Diffuse and excessive high signal intensity (DEHSI) was defined as areas of excessive high signal intensity (SI) diffusely distributed within the periventricular and/or subcortical WM on T 2 -weighted images (Fig. 4).

Neuroimaging of vascular changes

Structural neuroimaging techniques are of pivotal importance for the differential diagnosis of VaD, but also for elucidating the pathophysiological mechanisms surrounding the development of small vascular lesions in brain aging. In routine clinical settings, computed tomography (CT) and MRI provide evidence of vascular lesions that are rarely specific of a given diagnostic entity with the marked exception of cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leucoencephalopathy (CADASIL). In CADASIL, there are subcortical white matter lesions affecting the temporal pole and hyperintensity signals on T2-weighted images mainly in pons in the absence of low intensity T1 signals in deep brain stem and cerebellum.

Besides these rare cases, it is well established that most clinically overt VCI cases evolve progressively over several years via the accumulation of small vascular and microvascular lesions, mainly in subcortical regions. Subsequently, the construct of VCI has been proposed to capture the entire spectrum of cognitive disorders associated with all forms of cerebral vascular brain injury, not solely stroke, ranging from mild cognitive impairment through to fully developed dementia. As already proposed by the NINDS-AIREN criteria and subsequently confirmed by neuroimaging studies, a substantial percentage of VaD cases is due to SVD affecting small cerebral arterioles, capillaries and venules possibly due to intrinsic arteriolar occlusive disorder. Although the small vessels are not easily identifiable, detailed neuroimaging may allow for tracking of their pathology in the human brain. The main imaging features of SVD visible on 1.5 T and 3 T MRI scans are acute lacunar infarcts, neurologically silent lacunes, white matter hyperintensities, increased perivascular spaces and microbleeds (Figs. 2 and 3). Microinfarcts are strongly related to cognitive decline, yet they are detectable only at higher field strengths, usually only available in research facilities. Lacunar strokes correspond to lesions less than 20 mm in axial diameter; old lacunes are small cavities between 3 and 15 mm in diameter located in the deep grey or white matter. Both these lesions are known to affect cognition, mainly in pure VaD cases. On MRI scans, they are detected by increased signal on diffusion-weighted imaging, reduced signal on an apparent diffusion coefficient map, increased signal on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, increased T2-weighted imaging, reduced signal on T1-weighted MRI, and low attenuation on CT scanning. White matter hyperintensities are areas of decreased attenuation in CT scans, increased signal on T2 and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequences, and in some cases decreased on T1-weighted MRI scans. Present in periventricular and deep white matter, in the basal ganglia (deep grey matter) and more rarely in pons and cerebellum, they signal the progression of SVD and their severity is related to the emergence of VaD in clinical samples. Increased perivascular spaces are visible on T2- and T1-weighted MRI scans mostly in basal ganglia and subcortical white matter. Strongly related to white matter hyperintensities, they are very frequent in old age but the increase of their number is related to VCI. Finally, cortical microbleeds are punctiform areas of hypointensity on T2- or susceptibility-weighted sequences, of up to 1 cm of diameter. An impressive number of studies have attempted to define their cognitive significance with conflicting results; their negative impact on cognition is highly likely in VaD, but much less in mixed cases.

Variable definition

We defined studies as being in high risk populations if they were carried out in people selected for the presence of prevalent disease such as mild cognitive impairment, stroke, or other vascular events, or for the presence of a high risk factor profile. (See web extra tables 1–5 for the inclusion criteria for each study.) Stroke was defined as an acute onset focal neurological deficit of presumed vascular cause lasting at least 24 hours or interrupted by death within 24 hours. Web extra tables 1–5 show the number of events by stroke type (ischaemic versus haemorrhagic), when available. Unless specified differently (see web extra tables 1–5) we defined dementia according to the criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, third or fourth editions; Alzheimer's disease based on the criteria of the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association for definite, probable, or possible Alzheimer's disease; and vascular dementia according to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke and the Association Internationale pour la Recherche et l'Enseignement en Neurosciences criteria. Cognitive decline was defined as worsening performance on repeated neuropsychological tests. In the absence of consensus on which neuropsychological test was the most appropriate, we did not apply restrictions on type of test used. We examined separately tests of global cognitive function and tests assessing performances in specific cognitive domains (see web extra tables 1–5 for types of test used in each study).

Web extra table 6 details study quality criteria, including loss to follow-up, surveillance carried out for the diagnosis of incident events, description of the definition used for these events, and event subtypes.

### The clinical importance of white matter hyperintensities on brain magnetic resonance imaging: systematic review and meta-analysis [^40452f05]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

White matter hyperintensities may also have a role as a surrogate marker to assess treatment efficacy. Despite the importance of treatment, few have been shown to be specifically effective in the small vessel disease subtype of stroke. Treatment trials for small vessel disease face major challenges, including relatively slow progression of the disease necessitating large patient populations. Neuropathological studies have shown that white matter hyperintensities usually represent pathological small vessel disease, therefore white matter lesions may be useful to screen treatments before evaluation in much larger clinical studies, using stroke and dementia as clinical end points. The European Task Force on Age-Related White Matter Changes estimated that 195 people with confluent lesions would be required per treatment arm to show a 20% reduction in the rate of disease progression over three years. Criteria have been proposed for the use of imaging markers as surrogate markers for treatment trials. The first criterion was that the marker must be able to predict the natural course of the disease and should correlate with relevant clinical features in both cross sectional and longitudinal studies. Our meta-analysis provides strong evidence that this applies to white matter hyperintensities. A second criterion was that therapeutic interventions can delay progression of surrogate markers and that this correlates with reduced occurrence of clinical end points. Support for this is available from the magnetic resonance imaging substudy of the Perindopril Protection against Recurrent Stroke Study, which revealed a less noticeable progression of white matter hyperintensities with aggressive antihypertensive treatment, particularly in the subgroup of patients with a higher volume of white matter hyperintensities at study entry; an effect on clinical end points (stroke and cognitive decline) was also found in the main study.

Conclusions

In conclusion, our systematic review and meta-analysis provides strong evidence that white matter hyperintensities predict the risk of stroke, dementia, and mortality. This emphasises that white matter hyperintensities indicate increased cerebrovascular risk when identified clinically as part of diagnostic investigations and supports their use as an intermediate marker in a research setting. Further studies assessing the impact of progression of white matter hyperintensities on stroke and dementia are needed to help design therapeutic trials incorporating progression of white matter hyperintensities as an intermediate end point.

### The clinical importance of white matter hyperintensities on brain magnetic resonance imaging: systematic review and meta-analysis [^f0f7662f]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Various potential mechanisms could account for the association of white matter hyperintensities with dementia. Firstly, subcortical neural networks could be damaged directly. Consistent with this hypothesis is the predominant association with decline in executive functions (believed to depend on cortical-subcortical circuits passing through the white matter), which could be disrupted by damage to white matter. Secondly, white matter hyperintensities could interact with pathological changes related to Alzheimer's disease and thereby accelerate their clinical expression, or vice versa. Thirdly, white matter hyperintensities could be a confounder reflecting the association of vascular risk factorsor of concomitant ischaemic damage to the cortex with dementia. Several studies have adjusted for vascular risk factors, for prevalent or incident stroke, or for concomitant magnetic resonance imaging defined brain infarcts, and found similar results, suggesting that vascular risk factors are unlikely to be a major mechanism, although undetected cortical microinfarcts cannot be excluded. Finally, reverse causation through amyloid angiopathy or wallerian degeneration as a result of cortical atrophy has been hypothesised. However, data from the Austrian Stroke Prevention Study suggest that progression of lesions in white matter precedes loss in parenchymal volume in elderly people without dementia, implying that this reverse causation is unlikely to play a predominant role.

The finding that white matter hyperintensities were associated with an increased risk of dementia and Alzheimer's disease mainly in healthy populations and not in high risk patients who are already cognitively impaired, needs to be interpreted cautiously. Studies in high risk populations were carried out in small samples and had several methodological flaws. If this lesser association in higher risk and cognitively impaired populations is confirmed, however, it could suggest that once the neurodegenerative lesions become clinically evident, the effect of white matter lesions may be less important. As has been suggested by others, the presence of white matter hyperintensities may increase the risk that an individual will develop mild cognitive impairment or have declining performances on cognitive tests but may not be enough to facilitate progression from mild cognitive impairment to dementia, the latter being overwhelmingly driven by neurodegenerative lesions. An exception could be the rare cases of pure vascular dementia, where diffuse white matter hyperintensities could be important also at later stages of cognitive decline and conversion.

### Leukodystrophies in children: diagnosis, care, and treatment [^7a996766]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Leukodystrophies — magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as gold standard and interpretation caveats: An MRI of the brain is the gold standard investigation in a patient with a suspected leukodystrophy or leukoencephalopathy, and MRI is preferable to CT for visualizing abnormal signal and because it involves less radiation exposure; key features on MRI include the presence of contrast enhancement, the presence of cysts, calcifications, or more subtle structural abnormalities, and the predominant location, confluent versus multifocal pattern, and signal changes including hypomyelination versus high T2 signal abnormality and the relative T1 signal hyper- or hypointensity are primary discriminating characteristics; although MRI algorithms are helpful for diagnosis, there are limitations on their sensitivity and specificity, and they require skilled radiologic interpretation and experience; in a child younger than 1 year with possible hypomyelination, a follow-up MRI of the brain after 24 months, or serial MRIs every 6 to 12 months, is recommended to establish the diagnosis of hypomyelination; overall, the MRI findings should be interpreted in concert with the findings of the clinical history and physical examination.

### Clinical spectrum of reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome [^984a1622]. Pediatric Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

Reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome is a recently recognized disorder with characteristic radiologic findings that mainly involve the white/gray matter of the parieto-occipital lobes. This complex syndrome is associated with cyclosporine A therapy or a variety of other conditions in which blood pressure rises acutely. Twelve patients from a variety of conditions who met the diagnostic criteria for this syndrome were studied. Interestingly, three of these patients had intra-abdominal neurogenic tumors, which have rarely been reported. Initial cranial magnetic resonance imaging scans revealed fairly symmetric areas of increased T(2) signal involving both white and gray matter of parieto-occipital lobes in the majority of the patients. However, the lesions were often located outside the parieto-occipital regions. Four patients had occipital region magnetic resonance spectroscopy during the acute phase, which revealed high lactate peak and normal N-acetyl aspartate/creatine and choline peaks. With appropriate treatment, most patients recovered from this syndrome and experienced almost complete resolution of brain lesions on follow-up magnetic resonance imaging. One patient, however, continued to have small residual hemosiderin deposits on a follow-up magnetic resonance imaging with neurologic sequellae. In conclusion, a better understanding of this complex syndrome may obviate unnecessary investigations and allow management of the associated problems in prompt and appropriate ways.

### The clinical importance of white matter hyperintensities on brain magnetic resonance imaging: systematic review and meta-analysis [^d99b655d]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

As magnetic resonance imaging has become widely available and brain magnetic resonance imaging is increasingly being carried out in various clinical settings, clinicians often have to deal with the incidental discovery of white matter lesions, appearing as hyperintensities on T2 weighted images (fig 1). In the general population the prevalence of white matter hyperintensities ranges from 11–21% in adults aged around 64 to 94% at age 82. Pathological findings in regions of white matter hyperintensity include myelin pallor, tissue rarefaction associated with loss of myelin and axons, and mild gliosis. These lesions are located in the deep white matter, typically sparing subcortical U-fibres, and are often seen together with vessels affected by small vessel disease. The affected vessels are presumed to induce the lesions in deep white matter through chronic hypoperfusion of the white matter and disruption of the blood-brain barrier, leading to chronic leakage of plasma into the white matter. White matter hyperintensities are more common and extensive in patients with cardiovascular risk factors and symptomatic cerebrovascular disease. White matter hyperintensities can be measured quantitatively and non-invasively on large population samples and have been proposed as an intermediate marker, which could be used for the identification of new risk factors and potentially as a surrogate end point in clinical trials.

Fig 1 White matter hyperintensities on magnetic resonance imaging (axial fluid attenuated inversion recovery sequence) in two 80 year old patients: (left) minor white matter hyperintensities; (right) extensive white matter hyperintensities predominating in periventricular region. White matter lesions are considered present if hyperintense on T2 weighted, fluid attenuated inversion recovery, and proton density images, without prominent hypointensity on T1 weighted images

Several studies have assessed the relation between white matter hyperintensities and risk of stroke, dementia, and death, with partly conflicting results. We systematically reviewed and meta-analysed all published longitudinal studies that tested the association of white matter hyperintensities with risk of stroke, dementia, and death, both in the general population and in a hospital based setting.

### Metric to quantify white matter damage on brain magnetic resonance images [^2439f200]. Neuroradiology (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are a common neuroradiological finding detected in T2-weighted (T2 W) and fluid attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR) structural magnetic resonance images (MRI) in older individuals and patients with neurological diseases. Their growing importance reflects the increasing recognition of their association with a wide range of disabilities, vascular risk factors and impairments in activities of daily living. Different visual rating scales are available to assess their frequency, extent in various locations and progression. However, inter- and intra-observer variation in visual assessments have motivated development of computational methods for WMH burden quantification. With widespread availability of MRI technologies, there is growing expectation of incorporating these computational methods into diagnostic software.

The current literature on methods to quantify WMH burden and progression is large. Semi-automated or automated methods are thought to be sensitive and reproducible, but very few have been compared directly with each other, or with visual scores. Furthermore, errors in tissue classification, in exclusion or not of artefacts, and in manual correction of computer-generated masks have largely not been assessed but probably contribute to inconsistencies in results of studies of WMH associations. In most cases, the computational requirements to run the most up-to-date fully automatic segmentation techniques are not specified, nor the processing time, which could be many hours for a single dataset. So far, most large clinical or population studies have used conventional histogram-based thresholding of FLAIR images to assess WMH volume (see Supplementary Table from), mainly owed to its simplicity, minimal resource requirements and relative speed, and, perhaps for these reasons, there is a growing tendency to base assessment of new WMH quantification techniques on this approach. However, FLAIR-only derived thresholds are significantly affected by the WMH signal strength, anatomical distribution, extent and technical factors such as bias field correction.

### Asymptomatic cerebral small vessel disease in adults with low cardiovascular risk [^09e25bd4]. BMJ Neurology Open (2023). High credibility.

The imaging markers were defined by the STandards for ReportIng Vascular changes on nEuroimaging consortium, which unified definitions of CSVD biomarkers based on key neuroimaging characteristics. The MRIs were evaluated by an experienced neuroradiologist (ZMH-D) who was blind to clinical and laboratory details.

White matter hyperintensities (WMH) of vascular appearance were defined as hyperintense images in T2 and FLAIR, with absence of cavitation. Evaluation of WMH was performed in axial FLAIR images, WMH were independently evaluated using the semiquantitative Fazekas scale. WMHless than 10 mm from the ventricular system were categorised as periventricular. Each transverse slice was reviewed, the coronal and longitudinal slices were also analysed using MPR (multiplanar reconstruction) method of displaying three-dimensional WMH. A modification of Fazekas scale was used to assess the different types of hyperintense signal abnormalities surrounding the ventricles and in the deep white matter. Periventricular hyperintensity (PVH) and separate deep WMH signals (DWMH) were graded as: 0 — absence of PVH and DWMH, 1 — pencil-thin lining surrounding the lateral ventricles or in a cap around the frontal horns and/or isolated, punctate foci hyperintensities in white matter; 2 — PVH in soft halo and/or subcortical hyperintensity foci beginning to confluence; 3 — irregular PVH and/or large confluent areas extending to the deep white matter.

### The effect of white matter lesions on cognition in the elderly – small but detectable [^437c5193]. Nature Clinical Practice: Neurology (2007). Medium credibility.

The extent to which white matter changes affect brain function in elderly individuals is a matter for debate. Although there is a consensus that large confluent white matter lesions (WMLs) can be attributed to small-vessel disease and might denote anatomical damage to axons, the clinical effect of WMLs with regard to cognitive impairment is less certain. In this Review, we argue that WMLs are associated with greater detectable progressive cognitive deterioration than is normal aging, but other causes of progressive cognitive deterioration, such as Alzheimer's disease, are associated with greater cognitive decline than are WMLs. This view has important implications for the development of drugs for the treatment and prevention of cognitive impairment and dementia.

### Quantitative approaches for assessment of white matter hyperintensities in elderly populations [^4c7c16a4]. Psychiatry Research (2011). Low credibility.

White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are areas of increased signal on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), including fluid attenuated inverse recovery sequences. Total and regional WMH burden (i.e., volume or severity) has been associated with myriad cognitive, neurological, and psychiatric conditions among older adults. In the current report, we illustrate two approaches to quantify periventricular, deep, and total WMH and examine their reliability and criterion validity among 28 elderly patients enrolled in a depression treatment trial. The first approach, an operator-driven quantitative approach, involves visual inspection of individual MRI scans and manual labeling using a three-step series of procedures. The second approach, a fully automated quantitative approach, uses a processing stream that involves image segmentation, voxel intensity thresholding, and seed growing to label WMH and calculate their volume automatically. There was good agreement in WMH quantification between the two approaches (Cronbach's alpha values from 0.835 to 0.968). Further, severity of WMH was significantly associated with worse depression and increased age, and these associations did not differ significantly between the two quantification approaches. We provide evidence for good reliability and criterion validity for two approaches for WMH volume determination. The operator-driven approach may be better suited for smaller studies with highly trained raters, whereas the fully automated quantitative approach may be more appropriate for larger, high-throughput studies.

(i) Sagittal T1 sequence showing typical 'punched out holes' in the corpus callosum (arrows)

An important MRI differentiator from multiple sclerosis is leptomeningeal enhancement which was seen in 44% of this cohort (on post‐gadolinium T1 or FLAIR sequences) but which is not seen in multiple sclerosis. In our series, leptomeningeal enhancement was seen in one of the three cases previously diagnosed as multiple sclerosis. A recent study has suggested that up to 100% of patients with Susac syndrome demonstrate leptomeningeal enhancement on post‐gadolinium FLAIR sequences. Cerebrovascular inflammation and enhancement can also be seen using a 'black blood' MRI sequence. Acute lesions in Susac syndrome are often markedly hyperintense on diffusion‐weighted images with matched alteration of apparent diffusion coefficient maps consistent with restricted diffusion, whilst in comparison acute multiple sclerosis lesions only occasionally exhibit true restricted diffusion. In our series, 18 patients showed restricted diffusion on their initial MRI and in 13 of these patients the lesions crossed vascular territories. This highlights that Susac syndrome should always be considered in patients with diffusion‐restricted lesions in more than one vascular territory.

### Prevention of stroke in patients with silent cerebrovascular disease: a scientific statement for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^c7f604cc]. Stroke (2017). Medium credibility.

White matter hyperintensities — definition and intensity criteria state that a white matter hyperintensity (WMH) is an area of increased signal intensity of cerebral white matter on T2-weighted or fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI or an area of hypodensity on CT; depending on MRI parameters, WMHs may appear isointense or hypointense on T1, but they should not be as hypointense as cerebrospinal fluid, in which case the lesion should instead be classified as an infarct if presumed vascular.

### White matter hyperintensities in Alzheimer's disease: beyond vascular contribution [^b16bb65a]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2023). Medium credibility.

White matter hyperintensities (WMH), frequently seen in older adults, are usually considered vascular lesions, and participate in the vascular contribution to cognitive impairment and dementia. However, emerging evidence highlights the heterogeneity of WMH pathophysiology, suggesting that non-vascular mechanisms could also be involved, notably in Alzheimer's disease (AD). This led to the alternative hypothesis that in AD, part of WMH may be secondary to AD-related processes. The current perspective brings together the arguments from different fields of research, including neuropathology, neuroimaging and fluid biomarkers, and genetics, in favor of this alternative hypothesis. Possible underlying mechanisms leading to AD-related WMH, such as AD-related neurodegeneration or neuroinflammation, are discussed, as well as implications for diagnostic criteria and management of AD. We finally discuss ways to test this hypothesis and remaining challenges. Acknowledging the heterogeneity of WMH and the existence of AD-related WMH may improve personalized diagnosis and care of patients.

MRI came into wider use in clinical practice and for research in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Early MRI scanners of the 1980s–1990s were generally of lower field strength than are available routinely today. This affected their sensitivity. For example, the earliest scanners in clinical use were 0.2 or 0.5 Tesla field strength, and inevitably were less sensitive to subtle tissue changes than are the 1.5 or 3 T MR scanners that are in widespread use today. The early studies also had fewer sequences available and these were less sensitive to brain soft tissue changes than those available now. For example, it was common to use T1-weighted (T1) or T2 sequences, T1 being of similar sensitivity to subcortical changes as is modern CT scanning, while T2 is relatively insensitive to subtle white matter abnormalities and is less good at identifying changes adjacent to a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-containing space than is FLAIR (eg, in the immediate periventricular tissues). Hence, when considering imaging-pathological correlations, imaging-clinical, or imaging-cognitive correlations, it is important to bear in mind that early studies of MRI-pathology correlations may have lacked sensitivity to detect the more subtle changes that are visible today, and thus may have influenced our understanding of the pathophysiology towards what are probably more established, permanent changes.

### Adult leukodystrophies: a step-by-step diagnostic approach [^d64515c4]. Radiographics (2019). Medium credibility.

Leukodystrophies usually affect children, but in the last several decades, many instances of adult leukodystrophies have been reported in the medical literature. Because the clinical manifestation of these diseases can be nonspecific, MRI can help with establishing a diagnosis. A step-by-step approach to assist in the diagnosis of adult leukodystrophies is proposed in this article. The first step is to identify symmetric white matter involvement, which is more commonly observed in these patients. The next step is to fit the symmetric white matter involvement into one of the proposed patterns. However, a patient may present with more than one pattern of white matter involvement. Thus, the third step is to evaluate for five distinct characteristics-including enhancement, lesions with signal intensity similar to that of cerebrospinal fluid, susceptibility-weighted MRI signal intensity abnormalities, abnormal peaks at MR spectroscopy, and spinal cord involvement-to further narrow the differential diagnosis. © RSNA, 2019.

### The clinical importance of white matter hyperintensities on brain magnetic resonance imaging: systematic review and meta-analysis [^f9fb25df]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Using predefined search terms we identified references through searches of PubMed from 1966 to 23 November 2009 (see web extra methods 1). We also identified papers by reviewing the reference lists of relevant articles.

Study selection

Studies were limited to those in adults. We included only prospective studies with longitudinal data on the association of white matter hyperintensities with risk of stroke, dementia, cognitive decline, and death. We excluded studies if they evaluated white matter lesions only by computed tomography (because of the lower sensitivity of this method for measuring white matter lesions compared with magnetic resonance imaging); carried out magnetic resonance imaging at the end of follow-up instead of at baseline; or had a sample size of fewer than 50 patients. For studies with more than one publication describing results among overlapping groups of participants and with the same outcome measure, we included only the dataset with the longest follow-up. If the follow-up period was identical we included only the dataset with the largest number of patients (see web extra methods 2).

Data extraction

From the studies we extracted data on number of participants, general population versus high risk participants, mean age, duration of follow-up, characteristics of magnetic resonance imaging and definition of white matter hyperintensities, outcome definition (all strokes versus intracerebral haemorrhage or ischaemic stroke; all types of dementia versus Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, mixed vascular and Alzheimer's dementia; and neuropsychological measurements used to assess cognitive decline), and number of events that occurred during follow-up. For the measure of the association between white matter hyperintensities and the outcome we recorded, when available, hazard ratios, odds ratios, and adjustment variables when applicable. Both authors extracted the information from each study, resolving any disagreements by discussion.

### Diagnosis of cerebral amyloid angiopathy-related inflammation… [^c1d8f1e2]. JAMA Network (2016). Excellent credibility.

A, Dense amyloid deposition spans the entire vessel wall in a small cortical vessel without any associated inflammatory cells within the vessel wall or in the perivascular space. B, Inflammatory perivascular cell infiltrate surrounds an amyloid-laden small vessel. Scale bar = 100 μm. A and B, Shown are hyperintensities involving the temporal lobes bilaterally and the left frontal lobe and parieto-occipital lobe. A brain biopsy specimen demonstrated cerebral amyloid angiopathy, without evidence of inflammation. The patient began a high-dose, 5-day course of intravenous corticosteroids. C and D, One and a half months after the initial presentation, significant resolution of edema and white matter hyperintensities is seen.

Main Outcomes and Measures The sensitivity and specificity of prespecified criteria for probable CAA-ri and possible CAA-ri. Results. We further refined and operationalized these criteria to reflect previous experience with the clinical presentation, specific pattern of white matter hyperintensity distribution, and superficial siderosis as a type of bleeding manifestation of CAA. 7 Therefore, the modified criteria tested herein specify the following: clinical symptoms, such as headaches or decrease in consciousness, could occur over longer time frames; WMH patterns would be asymmetric and extend to the immediately subcortical white matter or simply extend to the immediately subcortical white matter; and the appearance of superficial siderosis would be counted as 1 bleeding manifestation for CAA. We performed exploratory post hoc analysis of available diffusion-weighted imaging and contrast-enhanced images. Small hyperintense DWI lesions were found in 1 of 13 in the CAA-ri group, in 6 of 18 in the group with noninflammatory CAA with lobar ICH, and in 3 of 16 in the group with noninflammatory CAA with no ICH.

### A multidisciplinary approach to the diagnosis and management of Wilson disease: 2022 practice guidance on Wilson disease from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^d210c948]. Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Wilson disease — brain imaging — Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain can be helpful in establishing a diagnosis for patients with unexplained neurological and psychiatric symptoms and frequently reveals findings consistent with Wilson disease, with typical MRI findings including signal changes in the basal ganglia, thalami, pons, and white matter, as well as atrophy; the so-called "face of the giant panda sign", which consists of increased T2 signal in the midbrain, has been considered pathognomonic for Wilson disease, but several other findings are more commonly seen. Patients with extensive changes on brain imaging, such as evidence of tissue cavitation, are less likely to improve with treatment, and in general, repeated MRIs are not useful for determining prognosis or monitoring neurological progression. Computerized tomography (CT) of the brain has limited utility for assessing Wilson disease.

### MRI criteria differentiating asymptomatic PML from new MS lesions during natalizumab pharmacovigilance [^e5cd431d]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Differentiation between progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) and new multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions on brain MRI during natalizumab pharmacovigilance in the absence of clinical signs and symptoms is challenging but is of substantial clinical relevance. We aim to define MRI characteristics that can aid in this differentiation.

Methods

Reference and follow-up brain MRIs of natalizumab-treated patients with MS with asymptomatic PML (n = 21), or asymptomatic new MS lesions (n = 20) were evaluated with respect to characteristics of newly detected lesions by four blinded raters. We tested the association with PML for each characteristic and constructed a multivariable prediction model which we analysed using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.

Results

Presence of punctate T2 lesions, cortical grey matter involvement, juxtacortical white matter involvement, ill-defined and mixed lesion borders towards both grey and white matter, lesion size of > 3cm, and contrast enhancement were all associated with PML. Focal lesion appearance and periventricular localisation were associated with new MS lesions. In the multivariable model, punctate T2 lesions and cortical grey matter involvement predict for PML, while focal lesion appearance and periventricular localisation predict for new MS lesions (area under the curve: 0.988, 95% CI 0.977 to 1.0, sensitivity: 100%, specificity: 80.6%).

Interpretation

The MRI characteristics of asymptomatic natalizumab-associated PML lesions proved to differ from new MS lesions. This led to a prediction model with a high discriminating power. Careful assessment of the presence of punctate T2 lesions, cortical grey matter involvement, focal lesion appearance and periventricular localisation allows for an early diagnosis of PML.

### The clinical importance of white matter hyperintensities on brain magnetic resonance imaging: systematic review and meta-analysis [^7b2cf286]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Objectives

To review the evidence for an association of white matter hyperintensities with risk of stroke, cognitive decline, dementia, and death.

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Data Sources

PubMed from 1966 to 23 November 2009.

Study Selection

Prospective longitudinal studies that used magnetic resonance imaging and assessed the impact of white matter hyperintensities on risk of incident stroke, cognitive decline, dementia, and death, and, for the meta-analysis, studies that provided risk estimates for a categorical measure of white matter hyperintensities, assessing the impact of these lesions on risk of stroke, dementia, and death.

Data Extraction

Population studied, duration of follow-up, method used to measure white matter hyperintensities, definition of the outcome, and measure of the association of white matter hyperintensities with the outcome.

Data Synthesis

46 longitudinal studies evaluated the association of white matter hyperintensities with risk of stroke (n = 12), cognitive decline (n = 19), dementia (n = 17), and death (n = 10). 22 studies could be included in a meta-analysis (nine of stroke, nine of dementia, eight of death). White matter hyperintensities were associated with an increased risk of stroke (hazard ratio 3.3, 95% confidence interval 2.6 to 4.4), dementia (1.9, 1.3 to 2.8), and death (2.0, 1.6 to 2.7). An association of white matter hyperintensities with a faster decline in global cognitive performance, executive function, and processing speed was also suggested.

Conclusion

White matter hyperintensities predict an increased risk of stroke, dementia, and death. Therefore white matter hyperintensities indicate an increased risk of cerebrovascular events when identified as part of diagnostic investigations, and support their use as an intermediate marker in a research setting. Their discovery should prompt detailed screening for risk factors of stroke and dementia.

### Prevention of stroke in patients with silent cerebrovascular disease: a scientific statement for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^da8a82b0]. Stroke (2017). Medium credibility.

American Heart Association/American Stroke Association statement — glossary for neuroimaging features of small vessel disease defines lacune of presumed vascular origin as a round or ovoid subcortical cavity between 3 and < 15 mm; perivascular spaces are round or ovoid with diameter generally < 3 mm when imaged perpendicular to the vessel; cerebral microbleed is generally 2–5 mm but sometimes up to 10 mm with susceptibility blooming; white matter hyperintensity (WMH) of presumed vascular origin is a white matter signal abnormality hyperintense on T2-weighted MRI such as fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) or hypodense on CT without cavitation; and atrophy is lower brain volume not related to focal injury such as infarction.

### Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging identifies the "Clinically relevant" small-penetrator infarcts… [^bb681839]. JAMA Network (2000). Excellent credibility.

A 63-year-old woman with sudden onset left-sided pure motor hemiparesis underwent magnetic resonance imaging 11 hours after symptom onset. Axial T2-weighted imaging shows multiple lesions in the right striatum, internal capsule, corona radiata, and periventricular white matter regions. Diffusion-weighted imaging identifies only the right corona radiata lesion as acute. © 2025 Background Most patients initially seen with a clinical syndrome consistent with a small-penetrator infarct also harbor multiple, chronic, hyperintense, white matter lesions on conventional magentic resonance imaging. Diffusion-weighted imaging can identify the clinically relevant "index infarction" in such circumstances, since it differentiates between acute and chronic lesions.

Fast FLAIR images were acquired with repetition time = 10, 002 milliseconds, echo time = 141 milliseconds, an inversion time of 2200 milliseconds, field of view = 24 cm, acquisition matrix = 256 × 192 pixels, slice thickness = 5 mm, slice gap = 1 mm, and 1 signal average. Fast spin echo T2WIs were acquired with repetition time = 4200 milliseconds, echo time = 102 milliseconds, field of view = 20 cm, acquisition matrix = 256 × 256 pixels, slice thickness = 5 mm, slice gap = 1 mm, and 1 signal average. Multiple, chronic, hyperintense white matter lesions were present in all 9 patients with lesions misidentified on T2WI, but only in 22 patients of the remaining 58 patients. Diffuse-weighted imaging hyperintense lesions involved the thalamus, internal capsule, and corona radiata in patients without congruous T2WIs. An example of a corona radiata lesion that was not identified on T2WI is shown on Figure 1.

Signal intensity in the ischemic brain regions increases on DWI within 30 minutes of vessel occlusion in animal models. 9 The corresponding signal changes on T2WI and FLAIR imaging become visible only after 8 to 24 hours. 19 In this respect, one would expect to see an improved rate of detection of small lesions by T2WI and FLAIR imaging because they are performed late.

### Cerebral sparganosis in children: epidemiological, clinical and MR imaging characteristics [^3b7835fe]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

MR imaging presentations

Recent publications illustrated importance of imaging modalities in diagnosis of this rare disease. Both Song and Moon reported cerebral sparganosis with the following imaging characteristics: low density on CT images; slight hypointense in T1W images and hyperintense in T2W images; a ring or a beaded enhancement on enhanced MR images with a similar shape as sparganum; and without the signal from small punctuate calcification while with the signal from small signal voids in T1W images. Chen reported low and high density lesions on CT images and high density for calcification on CT images and a ring or a beaded or a tortuous enhancement representing the shapes of the parasite on enhanced CT or MR images.

In our cases, MR presentations of cerebral sparganosis in children included solitary or multiple asymmetrical lesions, but a single lesion is a main presentation. Lesions mainly occur in the frontal or parietal lobe, with fewer lesions in temporal, occipital, basal ganglia, cerebellum and brainstem. Lesions mostly affect white matter, with fewer lesions in gray-white matter junction and gray matter. The shapes of lesions include irregular patchy, serpiginous tubular and tortuous linear pathways. Irregular large patchy areas of edema can be appreciated in the cerebral parenchyma surrounding the lesions. They are slight hypointense on T1WI but moderately hyperintense on T2WI with irregular large patchy areas of edema signal. In enhancement images, most lesions show a ring, a beaded, and a serpiginous tubular enhancements. Nodular, tortuous linear and comma-shaped enhancements can also be appreciated in few cases. The MR presentations in our study are similar to those in previous studies. However serpiginous tubular and comma-shaped enhancements of lesions have not been previously reported. The major possible reasons for existing different shapes on the lesion images are the followings: a ring, a serpiginous tubular, a tortuous linear, and a comma shaped enhancements are caused by different configuration of worm bodies; tortuous linear and comma shaped enhancements are due to compacting twist of the worm bodies; serpiginous tubular enhancement is due to losing twist of a worm body; and beaded enhancement is formed by eosinophilic granuloma yielded by worm stimulating brain tissue and tunnel produced by the worm body. The followings are a summary of the MR presentations on cerebral sparganosis in children from this study. First, there were a serpiginous tubular, a beaded and a tortuous linear enhancements of the lesions in the images. Second, a ring-enhanced lesion was relatively small with a diameter less than 2 cm, which may be due to sparganum stimulating brain tissue leading to eosinophilic granuloma shown in images. Third, there were changes in the location and shape of the lesions on follow-up enhanced images, suggesting that a migration happened and that the sparganum was alive.

Figure 3.
Imaging features of antemortem case 2. (A-H) Serial pairs of sagittal (A-D) and axial diffusion-weighted images (DWI) MRI (E-H) at 4 time points in the patient's hospital course. Noncontrast MRI at admission (A) shows patchy involvement of the whole corpus callosum without significant callosal thickening and with very limited patchy high signal intensity on DWI (E). Gadolinium-enhanced sagittal MRI (B) and axial DWI (F) 4½ weeks after admission show prominent punctate and slightly patchy enhancement within crossing callosal fibers, and much greater, nearly symmetrical increased SI on DWI image (F), with a thickened-appearing callosum. Gadolinium-enhanced sagittal MRI (C) and axial DWI (G) 8½ weeks after admission show reduced thickness of the corpus callosum, similar punctate and patchy callosal enhancement, and substantial interval increase in ventricular size. Gadolinium-enhanced sagittal MRI (D) and axial DWI (H) 20 weeks following admission show multifocal cavitation of the center of the corpus callosum with little to no central contrast enhancement. The axial DWI image shows near disappearance of the diffusion signal, reduced to scattered small patches of faint signal intensity. The lateral ventricles remain dilated. The faint focus of increased signal intensity (SI) at the splenium marks the site of callosal biopsy (arrowhead). Viewed serially, the 4 axial diffusion images show faint interval appearance (F) and markedly increased prominence (G) of bilateral, symmetrical foci of increased DWI signal in the related fibers of the centrum semiovale, which persist but become less prominent (H) in association with the cavitation of the central callosal fibers.

### Restricted diffusion in vanishing white matter… [^97cdd8d1]. JAMA Network (2012). Excellent credibility.

Figure 1. Magnetic resonance image of 1-year-old patient with vanishing white matter. A, Axial T2-weighted image shows diffusely abnormal white matter. B, On a fluid-attenuated inversion recovery image, abnormal but intact white matter is hyperintense; rarefied white matter is hypointense. Central white matter is rarefied, while the corpus callosum, internal capsule, and U fibers are not. C, Diffusion-weighted image shows low signal in rarefied white matter and high signal in abnormal, noncystic regions. D, Low apparent diffusion coefficient values indicate restricted diffusion in nonrarefied regions. C, The apparent diffusion coefficient map displays a low signal in area 1 and a high signal in the rest of the white matter.

Results Areas with decreased apparent diffusion coefficient values were found in the U fibers, cerebellar white matter, middle cerebellar peduncle, pyramids, genu or splenium of the corpus callosum, and posterior limb of the internal capsule. Diffusion-weighted imaging was performed with a single-shot stimulated-echo acquisition mode sequence18, 19. The proton density/T2 and DWI were located at the center of the brain slice, which was covered by several thin FLAIR images. All regions with restricted diffusion were hyperintense rather than hypointense on FLAIR images, indicative of tissue abnormality without cystic degeneration.

We observed decreased ADC values in specific white matter structures in VWM: U fibers, the corpus callosum, the internal capsule, cerebellar white matter, middle cerebellar peduncles, and pyramids. These are regions known to be relatively spared in VWM. 1, 2, 4, 20–24 In all patients with areas of restricted diffusion, FLAIR images confirmed that these areas were affected but not rarefied or cystic.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) diagnosis — initial recognition relies on a combination of clinical and neuroimaging findings with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) almost always demonstrating distinct white matter lesions corresponding to focal neurological deficits. Typical lesions are hyperintense on T2-weighted and fluid attenuated inversion recovery sequences and hypointense on T1-weighted sequences, usually without mass effect or displacement of normal structures, and contrast enhancement is present in 10% to 15% of cases and is usually sparse with a thin or reticulated appearance adjacent to the edge of the lesions. Advanced techniques such as diffusion-weighted imaging and magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy may provide additional diagnostic information, with new PML lesions and the advancing edge of large lesions showing high signal on diffusion-weighted imaging and normal-to-low apparent diffusion coefficient signifying restricted diffusion, and MR spectroscopy demonstrating decreased N-acetylaspartate and increased choline related to axonal loss and membrane/myelin breakdown, with the greatest changes at the center of lesions; a hyperintense cortical signal on non-enhanced T1-weighted cortex images has been associated with seizures complicating inflammatory PML. In most cases of PML, the combined clinical and radiographic presentations support a presumptive diagnosis.

### Imaging manifestations of the leukodystrophies, inherited disorders of white matter [^21ab4a79]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

The leukodystrophies are a diverse set of inherited white matter disorders and are uncommonly encountered by radiologists in everyday practice. As a result, it is challenging to recognize these disorders and to provide a useful differential for the referring physician. In this article, leukodystrophies are reviewed from the perspective of 4 imaging patterns: global myelination delay, periventricular/deep white matter predominant, subcortical white matter predominant, and mixed white/gray matter involvement patterns. Special emphasis is placed on pattern recognition and unusual combinations of findings that may suggest a specific diagnosis.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) patterns in leukodystrophies and mimics — illustrative figure — include a T2 image of normal brain; a T2 MRI image of VWM disease with hypodense (dark color) white matter and abnormal hyperintense (bright) white matter; a T2 image of MLD with hyperintense white matter; a T2 image of a hypomyelinating leukodystrophy, PMD, with relative paucity of myelin; and a T2 image of multiple sclerosis with scattered areas of hyperintense signal. A CT image of VWM disease shows abnormal signal in white matter but is much easier to see on MRI.

### Leucoencephalopathy with brainstem and spinal cord involvement and high lactate: quantitative magnetic resonance imaging [^677bdd35]. Brain (2011). Low credibility.

Leucoencephalopathy with brainstem and spinal cord involvement and elevated lactate is a white matter disorder caused by DARS2 mutations. The pathology is unknown. We observed striking discrepancies between improvement on longitudinal conventional magnetic resonance images and clinical deterioration and between large areas of high signal on diffusion-weighted imaging and small areas with low apparent diffusion coefficient values. These observations prompted a longitudinal and quantitative magnetic resonance imaging study. We investigated eight patients (two males, mean age 27 years). Maps of T(2) relaxation times, fractional anisotropy, apparent diffusion coefficients, signal on diffusion-weighted imaging, and axial and radial diffusivities were generated. Brain metabolites, obtained by chemical shift imaging, were quantified. Data analysis focused on: (i) white matter with low apparent diffusion coefficient; (ii) white matter with high T(2) values; (iii) white matter with intermediate T(2) values; and (iv) normal-appearing white matter. The areas were compared with similarly located areas in eight matched controls. In five patients, T(2)-weighted images, spectroscopy, apparent diffusion coefficient maps and diffusion-weighted imaging maps were compared with those obtained 5–7 years ago. In white matter with low apparent diffusion coefficient, axial and radial diffusivities were decreased and fractional anisotropy was high. T(2) values were intermediate. These areas with truly restricted diffusion were small and often observed at the periphery of areas with high T(2) values. In the white matter with high and intermediate T(2) values, apparent diffusion coefficients and axial and radial diffusivities were increased and fractional anisotropy decreased. The signal on diffusion-weighted imaging was highest in white matter with high T(2) values, an effect of T(2) shinethrough. Chemical shift imaging in both white matter types showed increased lactate, increased myo-inositol and decreased N-acetylaspartate, most pronounced in white matter with high T(2) values. Normal-appearing white matter was comparable with white matter of control subjects. Over time, mild decreases in T(2) signal intensities, signal on diffusion-weighted imaging and in extent of the low apparent diffusion coefficient areas were seen. In conclusion, the disease process in leucoencephalopathy with brainstem and spinal cord involvement and elevated lactate is extremely slow. We hypothesize that diffusion restriction is the first stage of the disease caused by intramyelinic water accumulation, followed by slow shift and then loss of the surplus of water. On conventional T(2) images this leads to improvement. We hypothesize that it is loss of water rather than structural restoration that causes the change in T(2) signal intensity, which would be in better agreement with the slow clinical deterioration.

### Automatic quantification of white matter hyperintensities on T2-weighted fluid attenuated inversion recovery magnetic resonance imaging [^c3129eb7]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are areas of increased signal visualized on T2-weighted fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences. They are typically attributed to small vessel cerebrovascular disease in the context of aging. Among older adults, WMH are associated with risk of cognitive decline and dementia, stroke, and various other health outcomes. There has been increasing interest in incorporating quantitative WMH measurement as outcomes in clinical trials, observational research, and clinical settings. Here, we present a novel, fully automated, unsupervised detection algorithm for WMH segmentation and quantification. The algorithm uses a robust preprocessing pipeline, including brain extraction and a sample-specific mask that incorporates spatial information for automatic false positive reduction, and a half Gaussian mixture model (HGMM). The method was evaluated in 24 participants with varying degrees of WMH (4.9–78.6 cm 3) from a community-based study of aging and dementia with dice coefficient, sensitivity, specificity, correlation, and bias relative to the ground truth manual segmentation approach performed by two expert raters. Results were compared with those derived from commonly used available WMH segmentation packages, including SPM lesion probability algorithm (LPA), SPM lesion growing algorithm (LGA), and Brain Intensity AbNormality Classification Algorithm (BIANCA). The HGMM algorithm derived WMH values that had a dice score of 0.87, sensitivity of 0.89, and specificity of 0.99 compared to ground truth. White matter hyperintensity volumes derived with HGMM were strongly correlated with ground truth values (r = 0.97, p = 3.9e-16), with no observable bias (-1.1 [-2.6, 0.44], p-value = 0.16). Our novel algorithm uniquely uses a robust preprocessing pipeline and a half-Gaussian mixture model to segment WMH with high agreement with ground truth for large scale studies of brain aging.

### The clinical importance of white matter hyperintensities on brain magnetic resonance imaging: systematic review and meta-analysis [^3f356139]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Implications of the review

The findings of this review have several implications. For the clinician, they emphasise the clinical importance of white matter hyperintensities, even when these are found as incidental findings on brain imaging. In such cases doctors might consider detailed screening for risk factors for stroke and dementia, even though the benefit of doing so is not formally proved. Although data showing that treatment of risk factors reduces the progression of white matter hyperintensities are limited, more aggressive antihypertensive treatment was associated with reduced progression in patients after stroke, as well as with a reduction in stroke itself.

In terms of research, white matter hyperintensities could constitute a potentially useful intermediate marker for the identification of new risk factors for stroke and dementia. Indeed, besides being strongly associated with the risk of stroke and dementia, white matter hyperintensities can be quantified reliably and non-invasively on large samples and can be measured as a continuous trait, thus providing increased statistical power to detect an association. White matter hyperintensities could prove particularly interesting for the identification of novel genetic risk factors, as their heritability was shown to be as high as 55–73%.

### Prevention of stroke in patients with silent cerebrovascular disease: a scientific statement for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^8e753a03]. Stroke (2017). Medium credibility.

White matter hyperintensities — WMH reporting may be the most variable of all the manifestations of silent cerebrovascular disease, and many synonyms for WMH such as leukoaraiosis, white matter changes, and small vessel ischemic disease have entered the literature. WMHs become ubiquitous with advanced age, and although clinical reports may omit them when expected for age, there is no clear scientific evidence for a threshold below which WMH can be considered entirely benign, and there is no uniform approach to describing their extent. The STRIVE group recommends adoption of the term T2 WMHs, or CT white matter hypodensity, of presumed vascular origin as a consensus term, and several rapid, easy-to-use visual rating scales have been developed and validated against quantitative volumetric assessments to allow standardized reporting; probably the quickest to apply and among the best validated is the Fazekas scale.

### MRI in methotrexate-related leukoencephalopathy: disseminated necrotising leukoencephalopathy in comparison with mild leukoencephalopathy [^390d1616]. Neuroradiology (2003). Low credibility.

We report two fatal cases of methotrexate (MTX)-induced disseminated necrotising leukoencephalopathy (DNL) in which MRI was repeated from the onset. Initial T2-weighted images showed multiple areas of high signal, mainly in deep cerebral white matter, which on follow-up, spread and coalesced to involve the entire white matter. Small irregular low-signal foci on T2-weighted images were seen within the high-signal lesions. Multiple areas of contrast enhancement corresponded to these low-signal foci. The condition of both patients deteriorated and they died. We compared their MRI findings with those of seven patients with mild MTX-related leukoencephalopathy, six of whom were asymptomatic; one had transient neurological symptoms. They showed no contrast enhancement, but rather mild-to-moderate diffuse high signal in deep white matter, which later disappeared. These findings suggest that multiple low-signal foci on T2-weighted images with contrast enhancement may be characteristic of DNL, and that contrast-enhanced imaging is useful to differentiate this condition from mild leukoencephalopathy.

### Focal areas of high signal intensity in children with neurofibromatosis type 1: expected evolution on MRI [^bc3a25d2]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Focal areas of high signal intensity are T2WI/T2-FLAIR hyperintensities frequently found on MR imaging of children diagnosed with neurofibromatosis type 1, often thought to regress spontaneously during adolescence or puberty. Due to the risk of tumor in this population, some focal areas of high signal intensity may pose diagnostic problems. The objective of this study was to assess the characteristics and temporal evolution of focal areas of high signal intensity in children with neurofibromatosis type 1 using long-term follow-up with MR imaging.

Materials and Methods

We retrospectively examined the MRIs of children diagnosed with neurofibromatosis type 1 using the National Institutes of Health Consensus Criteria (1987), with imaging follow-up of at least 4 years. We recorded the number, size, and surface area of focal areas of high signal intensity according to their anatomic distribution on T2WI/T2-FLAIR sequences. A generalized mixed model was used to analyze the evolution of focal areas of high signal intensity according to age, and separate analyses were performed for girls and boys.

Results

Thirty-nine patients (ie, 285 MR images) with a median follow-up of 7 years were analyzed. Focal areas of high signal intensity were found in 100% of patients, preferentially in the infratentorial white matter (35% cerebellum, 30% brain stem) and in the capsular lenticular region (22%). They measured 15 mm in 95% of cases. They appeared from the age of 1 year; increased in number, size, and surface area to a peak at the age of 7; and then spontaneously regressed by 17 years of age, similarly in girls and boys.

Conclusions

Focal areas of high signal intensity are mostly small (< 15 mm) abnormalities in the posterior fossa or capsular lenticular region. Our results suggest that the evolution of focal areas of high signal intensity is not related to puberty with a peak at the age of 7 years. Knowledge of the predictive evolution of focal areas of high signal intensity is essential in the follow-up of children with neurofibromatosis type 1.

Quantitative Assessment of WMA: Volumes, Percentage, and Location

The 1 infant with periventricular hemorrhagic infarction who was excluded from the comparison of clinical characteristics was included in the quantitative assessment of WMA. Among the 40 infants who had any WMA, 37 had both early‐life and TEA scans, 1 infant had a TEA scan only, and 2 infants had early‐life scans only. The volume of WMA ranged from 0 to 1495mm 3. WMA was moderate in all 3 cases where only an early‐life or a TEA scan was available. Based on clinical scoring of infants with WMA at either timepoint who had both scans (n = 37), the severity of WMA on early‐life MRI was minimal in 16 (43.2%), moderate in 15 (40.5%), and severe in 3 (8.1%) (Table 1). WMA was undetectable in 7 of 37 (18.9%) or less visible, that is, less T1 hypointense on the TEA scan in 22 of 37 (59.5%) infants (see Fig 1 for an example). All of the infants with undetectable WMA at TEA had minimal WMA (≤ 3 areas measuring < 2mm) at early scan. The total WMA volume identified on the TEA scans was less than that on the early scans (mean difference −72.7 ± 207.5mm 3, p = 0.025). The percentage of WMA to TCV at TEA was also significantly less than that at early‐life (mean difference −0.033 ± 0.088, p < 0.001) (Table 1). WMA volumes in the parietal lobe and temporal lobe were greater than those in frontal and occipital lobes. Total WMA volume in frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes for most of the 37 infants with both scans were reduced from early‐life to TEA. Eleven of 37 infants had some WMA in the occipital lobe, 5 infants on early‐life MRI (range: 1–4mm 3), 10 on TEA MRI (range: 1–30mm 3), and 1 on both (early‐life: 12mm 3; TEA: 56mm 3). Interestingly, 8 of these 11 infants had slightly increased WMA in occipital lobe from early‐life to TEA (range: 1–44mm 3), although this increase was minimal (Fig 2). In these 8 infants, the total WMA volume at TEA (p = 0.022), percentage of WMA to TCV at TEA (p = 0.026), and WMA volume in occipital lobe at TEA (p < 0.001) were greater than those in 29 infants without increased occipital lobe WMA. These measurements were not statistically significantly different on early scan. The total WMA volume from early‐life to TEA decreased in both groups (Table S3).

### The clinical importance of white matter hyperintensities on brain magnetic resonance imaging: systematic review and meta-analysis [^2571042e]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Limitations of the review

Although we corrected for statistical heterogeneity in the meta-analyses, the measurement and analysis of white matter hyperintensities varied substantially (see web extra tables 1–5). One important source of heterogeneity was the automated quantitative versus visual semiquantitative measurement of white matter hyperintensity volume, although visual semiquantitative scales were shown to correlate well with volumetric measures. Furthermore, total intracranial volume was unequally included in the analyses to account for differences in head size, and not all studies explicitly distinguished white matter hyperintensities from lacunar infarcts. Consensus recommendations on the measurement of white matter hyperintensities and their progression, as have been published for instance for carotid intima-media thickness, would be useful to improve the comparability of future studies. Another limitation is that some studies could not be included in the meta-analysis because white matter hyperintensity was studied only as a continuous variable using different scales. All the results, including those that were not incorporated in the meta-analysis, are available in web extra tables 1–5. The pooled hazard ratios for dichotomous measures of burden of white matter hyperintensities also need to be interpreted with caution, given the heterogeneous definitions of these measures across studies. They should therefore not be extrapolated to estimate the individual risk of stroke, dementia, or death in a patient with white matter hyperintensities on magnetic resonance imaging. To be as comprehensive as possible in this review we included studies using different tests or criteria for the diagnosis of cognitive decline and dementia, which is an additional source of heterogeneity. Finally, given the strong association of vascular risk factors both with burden of white matter hyperintensities and with the clinical outcomes we studied, it would be interesting to assess the modifying effect of these risk factors on the associations we reported. This was not feasible in the present paper, however, as the nature and definition of vascular risk factors included in the analyses varied substantially across studies.

MRI features of SVD

The presence and components of cerebral SVD, such as silent lacunar infarcts (SLI), white matter hyperintensities (WMH), cerebral microbleeds (CMB), and EPVS were categorized according to the Standards for Reporting Vascular Changes on Neuroimaging recommendations. We defined SLI as a focal lesion ≥ 3 mm in diameter that was hyperintense on T2-weighted imaging and hypointense on FLAIR images. We defined WMH as periventricular and deep white matter hyperintense lesions on T2-weighted and FLAIR images. Irregular periventricular hyperintensity (Fazekas grade ≥ 3) and/or early confluent or confluent separate deep white matter hyperintense lesions (Fazekas grade ≥ 2) was defined as severe WMH. We defined CMB as a focal area of signal loss in the brain parenchyma of < 5 mm on a T2✱-weighted gradient-echo imaging scan. We defined EPVS as small (< 3 mm), punctate (if perpendicular to the plane of the scan), or linear (if longitudinal to the plane of the scan) hyperintensities on T2 images in the basal ganglia or centrum semiovale, as previously reported.BG-EPVS and CSO-EPVS were coded with the following scale, applied to standard axial images: 0 (no EPVS); 1 (≤ 10 EPVS); 2 (11–20 EPVS); 3 (21–40 EPVS); and 4 (> 40 EPVS) (Supplementary Figure 1). Total cerebral SVD score was also calculated as the MRI SVD burden. On the basis of a previous study, we rated the total MRI burden of SVD on an ordinal scale ranging from 0 to 4 by summing the presence scores of each of the four features of cerebral SVD. In detail, the scoring system is as follows: (1) SLI, 1 point if present; (2) CMB, 1 point if present; (3) EPVS, 1 point if present in moderate-to-severe form in the basal ganglia [grades 2–4]); and (4) WMH, 1 point for the presence of either (early) confluent deep WMH (Fazekas score of 2 or 3) or irregular periventricular WMH extending into the deep white matter (Fazekas score of 3). In this sub-analysis, Cohen's kappa coefficient was calculated on the basis of the MRI data of a randomly selected subset of 20 participants to assess the inter-rater reliability (for N.S. and Y.K.) and intra-rater reliability (for N.S.), as a measure of the quality of the assessment data for each component of cerebral SVD, as in the Gimlet study. Kappa values between 0.76 and 1.00 were interpreted as indicative of adequate agreement.

### Flutemetamol f-18 (Vizamyl) [^41b79672]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Negative VIZAMYL Scan

Negative scans show more signal in white matter than in gray matter, creating clear gray-white matter contrast.

Specifically, a negative scan would have the following characteristics:

frontal, lateral temporal, and inferolateral parietal lobes: gradual gradient from bright intensity of the white matter to lower intensity at the periphery of the brain; distinct sulci with concave surfaces (white matter sulcal pattern),
and
posterior cingulate and precuneus: gray matter uptake below 50% to 60% of peak intensity; gap of lower intensity separates two hemispheres on coronal view,
and
striatum: approximately 50% of peak intensity or lower in the region between the higher intensities of the thalamus and frontal white matter (striatal "gap").

A negative scan indicates sparse to no neuritic plaques. In patients being evaluated for AD and other causes of cognitive decline who have not been treated with amyloid beta-directed therapy, a negative scan is inconsistent with a neuropathological diagnosis of AD at the time of image acquisition and reduces the likelihood that a patient's cognitive impairment is due to AD. A negative scan result does not preclude the accumulation of amyloid beta in the brain in the future.

### The splenium of the corpus callosum: embryology, anatomy, function and imaging with pathophysiological hypothesis [^ca354b11]. Neuroradiology (2020). Medium credibility.

A2. Ventral splenial edema

In adults, a rim of hyperintense signal on FLAIR at the ventral border of the splenium has been described in older patients and those that have been treated with radiotherapy. This finding is illustrated in Fig. 5, showing FLAIR images of an older patient with mood and behavioral changes and cognitive decline.

Fig. 6
Thirty-year-old man. Axial DWI (a) showing a central area of high signal in the splenium, without low signal on ADC (b) and comparable high signal on FLAIR (c), compatible with T2 shine through effect and white matter edema. Axial T2 (d) shows a typical giant panda sign at the level of the mesencephalon-pons. On follow-up 2 years later, the DWI (e) shows a small residual splenial lesion on the right, and axial T2 (f) at the level of the mesencephalon shows atrophy and increase in low signal in the substantia nigra and nucleus ruber

Pekala et al. describe one autopsy case, which showed loss of axons and myelin sheaths and isomorphic gliosis. In their study, they found a clear correlation between this finding and white matter disease seen in normal aging.

We hypothesize that this region may represent edema in the hippocampal commissure. The pathological significance and the clinical relevance have not been studied so far and the precise effect on memory and behavior is unknown.

B. Acquired parietal-occipital-temporal cerebral pathology extending into or from the splenium

B1. Metabolic diseases

Metabolic diseases, such as Metachromatic Leukodystrophy and Mucopolysaccharisodoses, usually affect the entire CC. In Leighs disease, sole involvement of the splenium and no extension into the remainder of the CC is exceptional and has been described in only two case reports. In the following section, we will focus on (a) Wilson's disease, in which the splenium may be affected; (b) X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD), which initially affects the splenium; and (c) Krabbe's disease, which involves the splenium at a later stage, together with the peritrigonal white matter.

### Quantitative analysis of punctate white matter lesions in neonates using quantitative susceptibility mapping and R2* relaxation [^52ec3ee5]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

It is difficult to distinguish punctate white matter lesions from focal hemorrhagic lesions in neonates on conventional MR imaging because both kinds of lesions show increased signal intensity on T1-weighted images and, frequently, decreased signal intensity on T2-weighted images. Our aim was to distinguish punctate white matter lesions and focal hemorrhagic lesions using quantitative measures.

Materials and Methods

In the current study, we acquired multiecho gradient recalled-echo MR imaging data from 24 neonates with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy and postprocessed them as R2* relaxation maps and quantitative susceptibility maps. Seven subjects who were found to have multifocal punctate white matter lesions and/or focal hemorrhagic lesions on R2* maps were included (mean gestational age at birth, 33 ± 4.28 weeks; mean gestational age at scanning, 38 ± 2 weeks). Manually drawing ROIs on R2* maps, we measured R2* and magnetic susceptibility values of the lesions, along with white matter regions within the corpus callosum as healthy comparison tissue.

Results

R2* and magnetic susceptibility values were both found to easily distinguish punctate white matter lesions, focal hemorrhagic lesions, and healthy white matter tissue from each other (P < .05), with a large Hedge g. R2* and magnetic susceptibility values were significantly increased in focal hemorrhagic lesions compared with punctate white matter lesions and healthy white matter tissue. Punctate white matter lesions were also found to have significantly increased values over healthy white matter tissue.

Conclusions

R2* and quantitative susceptibility maps can be used to help clinicians distinguish and measure focal hemorrhages, punctate white matter lesions, and healthy white matter tissue.

### White matter lesion progression: a surrogate endpoint for trials in cerebral small-vessel disease [^1e37ffd4]. Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

There is neuropathologic evidence that confluent MRI white matter lesions in the elderly reflect ischemic brain damage due to microangiopathy. The authors hypothesize that measuring changes in the progression of white matter lesions as shown by MRI may provide a surrogate marker in clinical trials on cerebral small-vessel disease in which the currently used primary outcomes are cognitive impairment and dementia. This hypothesis is based on evidence that confluent white matter lesions progress rapidly as shown in a recent follow-up study in community-dwelling subjects. The mean increase in lesion volume was 5.2 cm(3) after 3 years. Based on these data in a clinical trial, 195 subjects with confluent lesions would be required per treatment arm to demonstrate a 20% reduction in the rate of disease progression over a 3-year period. Like any other MRI metric, the change in white matter lesion volume cannot be considered preferable to clinical outcomes unless it has been demonstrated that it matters to the patient in terms of function.

### Imaging findings of mucopolysaccharidoses: a pictorial review [^5b709de0]. Insights Into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Neuroradiological imaging findings

The pathogenetic substrate of central nervous system involvement lies in the abnormal accumulation of mucopolysaccharides within perivascular spaces and neuro-axonal units with an adversely affected myelin turnover.

On the basis of MRI findings a large spectrum of severity can be recognised, from negligible to severe. Here we describe the main neuroradiological features: abnormal signal intensity in the white matter and in the basal ganglia, dilatation of periventricular spaces, widening of cortical sulci, brain atrophy and enlargement of extraventricular spaces, and spinal cord compression. Recently, a few cases of closed cephalocele have been reported in the literature.

Abnormal signal intensity in the white matter and in the basal ganglia

One of the typical neuroradiological imaging findings is represented by focal or diffuse white matter lesions, detected as areas of high signal intensity on T2-weighted sequences. These alterations show an increase with aging, becoming more extensive with time.

Diffuse white matter lesions usually show a symmetrical periventricular distribution, although they can also be found as patchy lesions in the subcortical region (Fig. 13). They derive from the delay of myelination in young children and progressive demyelination in the course of the disease; these lesions can also reflect gliosis. Focal white matter lesions consist of multiple small spot-like areas isointense to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) on fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), T2-weighted and T1-weighted sequences (Fig. 14) because of periventricular space enlargement.

Axial T2-weighted fast spin-echo (a), T2-weighted FLAIR (b) and coronal T2-weighted fast spin-echo (c) images of the brain show symmetrically diffuse increased signal intensity of periventricular white matter, with enlargement of subarachnoid spaces in the middle cranial fossa and ventriculomegaly.

### Assessment of lesions on magnetic resonance imaging in multiple sclerosis: practical guidelines [^f1784181]. Brain (2019). Medium credibility.

Three main topics were addressed during the workshop: (i) re-examination and definition of features characteristic for individual multiple sclerosis lesions and for patterns of their distribution ('green flags') as defined in the 2017 revision of the McDonald criteria; (ii) depiction of lesion patterns that satisfy current multiple sclerosis diagnostic criteria, but are not characteristic of multiple sclerosis. They may be associated with other diseases mimicking multiple sclerosis, an artefact or an incidental lesion related to a comorbidity and constitute 'red flags' for multiple sclerosis diagnosis. Examples include ischaemic lesions, peculiar patterns of contrast enhancement, or age-related 'periventricular capping' on T 2 -weighted images. They also encompass distinctive MRI features of recently recognized antibody-mediated diseases (e.g. neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders and anti-MOG-IgG disease); and (iii) discussion of emerging features of lesions (e.g. central vein sign, subpial demyelination and lesion rims), which are likely, in the near future, to improve specificity of the diagnostic algorithm for multiple sclerosis.

### White matter disease derived from vascular and demyelinating origins [^a00b2b6a]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

We here summarise the key differences found in MRI to distinguish CVSD and MS (figures 2–4). Multiple, T2-hyperintense white matter lesions on conventional MRI are common features shared by CSVD and MS, mainly presenting as white matter hyperintensity with similar shapes and locations, especially the periventricular lesions. Lacunes of presumed vascular origin are typically white matter lesions seen on MRI in basal ganglia, internal capsule, thalamus and pons, which can occur silently or after an acute small subcortical infarct or haemorrhage, which are 3–15 mm cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-filled cavities. White matter hyperintensities are patchy or confluent depending on the stage of development and severity. A hypointense hole surrounded by a hyperintense rim on FLAIR sequence is distinctive for lacunes. These are usually symmetrically and bilaterally distributed in the white matter, pons, brain stem and deep grey matter in patients with CSVD. But in contrast, Dawson's finger sign, which is defined as wedge-shaped areas with a broad base to the ventricle, and extensions into adjoining tissue in the form of finger-like processes or ampullae, is specific in MS periventricular lesions. Certain lesions may appear hypointense on T1-weighted images, so-called black holes. Similar to a 'silent stroke', individuals with T2 hyperintensities on brain MRI strongly suggestive of MS but without neurological presentations or other explanations are distinguished as radiologically isolated syndrome. Radiologically isolated syndromes could provide an early indication and diagnosis of MS and also increases the rate of misdiagnosis and the possibility of adverse effects of immune therapies.

### An algorithmic approach to structural imaging in dementia [^246ccdc2]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2014). Low credibility.

FLAIR/T2 hyperintensity

Located in cerebral white matter: Hyperintensities in cerebral white matter on T2-weighted or FLAIR imaging, and less prominently on T1-weighted imaging, are more likely to be vascular in origin. If deep grey matter and brainstem hyperintensities are also apparent the term subcortical hyperintensities of presumed vascular origin should be used. The severity of hyperintensities can be visually quantified by application of an established rating scale such as the age-related white matter changes scaleor the Fazekas scale. Confluence of hyperintensities in at least two regions, and the beginning of confluence of hyperintensities in a further two regions, is considered to represent the involvement of at least a quarter of the total white matter and is sufficient to assume SVD is the cause of VCI or VaD. However, even in cases of extensive white matter hyperintensities, the existence of mixed pathology should be considered, although it may be difficult to confirm or refute. Extension of confluent hyperintensities into the temporal poles is rare and may indicate that the pathology is not of 'conventional' vascular origin. If the patient has a positive family history of dementing illness and is known to have suffered previously from strokes and/or migraines, cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) should also be considered and genetic testing may be appropriate(see figure 4). Although a relatively rare form of dementia, CADASIL is included here due to this fairly specific (but not entirely sensitive) feature of non-enhancing hyperintensities extending in to the temporal poles, with white matter changes often appearing relatively more severe than expected from the patient's clinical appearance. While temporal lobe extension raises the question of CADASIL it may also feature in demyelinating conditions such as multiple sclerosis. If demyelinating disease is a diagnostic consideration then contrast enhanced axial T1-weighted brain scanning with Gadolinium may demonstrate active/new lesions. Less often, multifocal/confluent regions of hyperintensity in a patient with suspected dementia may result from a number of other conditions, including infections, inflammatory demyelinating diseases, leukodystrophies or leukoencephalopathies. Infective processes may need consideration in immunocompromised patients at risk of opportunistic infections, including cerebral toxoplasmosis.
Strategic Infarcts: T2/FLAIR hyperintensities with corresponding T1 hypointensity in strategic locations such as arterial territories, association areas and watershed carotid territories may be sufficient to produce cognitive symptoms which can be termed VaD due to large vessel disease. Hyperintensities with CSF-like signal intensity on all MRI sequences (dark on T1 and FLAIR, bright on T2) in the region of a single deep perforating arteriole are likely to represent recent small deep brain infarcts. The inclusion of a rim of hyperintensity on FLAIR images (thought to reflect gliosis) is sufficient to indicate a lacune of vascular origin, and is useful to help distinguish them from prominent perivascular spaces. Additionally, prominent perivascular spaces will typically appear linear when imaged parallel to the course of the vessel, and round or ovoid, with a diameter generally smaller than 3 mm, when imaged perpendicular to the course of the vessel. Bilateral thalamic lesions are sufficient to imply VaD due to SVD. It should be noted that T2-weighted images are more sensitive to signal change in the thalamus than FLAIR images.
Striatum and/or neocortex: Although rare, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is included in the algorithm as it has very characteristic MRI features: hyperintensities in the cortex and/or basal ganglia, particularly in the putamen, best seen on FLAIR imaging. Diffusion weighted imaging sequences have greater sensitivity to hyperintensities within these regions(see figure 4), which may be especially prominent in the early stages of the disease when vacuoles are small resulting in restricted diffusion. In rapidly progressive dementia where there is doubt over the diagnosis of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, contrast enhanced MRI scanning is recommended to rule out alternative causes.
No Regions of Hyperintensity: The absence of hyperintensities on T2 or FLAIR imaging indicates the patient's symptoms are very unlikely to be vascular in origin. Neurodegenerative pathology therefore remains the most likely cause of cognitive impairment and structural imaging should be assessed for atrophy.

### Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease with subtle imaging findings: a case report and literature review [^763c2e6f]. BMJ Neurology Open (2025). High credibility.

Notably, negative imaging findings do not exclude NIID, as early-stage changes at the corticomedullary junction can be subtle and easily overlooked even when typical imaging is lacking. Ni Y et al reported two NIID patients with recurrent encephalitis and apathy, showing only reversible cortical swelling, progressive white matter lesions, and brain atrophy, with no typical NIID imaging features during follow-up. Dong et al reported NIID with only progressive white matter changes and atrophy. Cupidi et al described mild leukoaraiosis with no DWI abnormalities due to minimal U-fibre involvement. Cerebral white matter lesions are a major NIID imaging manifestation, typically showing bilateral symmetrical diffusion affecting frontal lobe white matter tracts. This correlates with leucoencephalopathy-related dementia in NIID patients. Our case series shows progressive white matter lesion expansion parallel to cognitive decline in all NIID patients. For patients with leukoencephalopathy showing diffusion restriction, cognitive decline and motor symptoms, consider adult-onset leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids and pigmented glia (ALSP) and alanyl-tRNA synthetase gene (AARS2-L) in differential diagnosis. Both show asymmetric periventricular and deep white matter changes, with possible pyramidal tract or basal ganglia involvement. ALSP shows persistent punctate diffusion restriction, while AARS2-L presents more confluent lesions. In our case, white matter lesions were symmetrically distributed around lateral ventricles with mild DWI hyperintensity and characteristic corticomedullary junction signal. The absence of fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome findings, such as symmetric T2 hyperintensity in middle cerebellar peduncle, supports differential diagnostic features. However, this report has limitations as cerebrospinal fluid Aβ, T-tau and positron emission tomography-computed tomography(PET-CT) were not performed, and coexisting AD dermatitis cannot be ruled out.

Our case showed the patient initially presented with memory deterioration and episodic encephalopathy. Hyperintensities at the corticomedullary junction were visible on early imaging but disregarded. This highlights the diagnostic challenge of early NIID, where imaging findings may precede clinical symptoms and are often missed. For patients without DWI abnormalities, paroxysmal encephalopathy should raise suspicion of NIID, requiring genetic testing and skin biopsy.

### Low signal intensity in U-fiber identified by susceptibility-weighted imaging in two cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy [^41921c4c]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2014). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a useful tool for diagnosing and monitoring progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). Although characteristic MRI findings of PML are well known, we noted a potential new finding for this disease on susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI). Two patients with PML were studied and followed using MRI. SWI revealed low signal intensities in U-fibers adjacent to the white matter lesions of PML. These findings progressed along with the disease progression. The cause underlying these findings remains unclear. This new finding suggests that SWI is useful for the diagnosis of PML. It can provide a helpful clue in a clinical setting.

### Neuropathology associated with diffuse excessive high signal intensity abnormalities on magnetic resonance imaging in very preterm infants [^e98f8e83]. Pediatric Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Diffuse excessive high signal intensity abnormality is the most common finding on term-equivalent age magnetic resonance imaging in extremely preterm infants. Yet its clinical significance remains a matter of debate, in part because of a lack of prior imaging-pathology correlational studies.

Patient Presentations

We present two 24-week-gestation infants with complicated clinical courses who died at 33 and 46 weeks postmenstrual age with magnetic resonance imaging evidence of diffuse excessive high signal intensity. Two patients with periventricular leukomalacia and two without injury were examined for comparison. Immunohistochemistry characterized the presence of reactive astrocytes, microglia, myelin, and axons. Infants with periventricular leukomalacia demonstrated the typical microscopic necrosis with spheroids, gliosis/microgliosis with reduction in stainable myelin and axons. Infants with diffuse excessive high signal intensity showed vacuolated regions with increased reactive astrocytes and microglia and fewer oligodendroglial cell bodies/processes and dramatic reduction in axon number.

Conclusion

These two individuals with diffuse excessive high signal intensity exhibited pathologic characteristics that were overlapping but distinct from those of periventricular leukomalacia.

### What are white matter hyperintensities made of? Relevance to vascular cognitive impairment [^2e0c0ff6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Irrespective of the method used to quantify WMH, one factor that affects the assessment of WMH is the subtle variation in the radio-frequency magnetic field known as magnetic field inhomogeneity. Image processing methods that correct for magnetic field inhomogeneities have been used in some studies.–Some of these methods are scanner and protocol-specific, while others are part of publicly available software where the algorithms assume that the software is applied to brain images with only voxels containing CSF, gray matter, and white matter, after all other tissue types are removed. If applied to FLAIR images with WMH, these tools may try to remove the WMH or focal infarcts, which are interpreted as inhomogeneities (Figure 10). Hence, these methods should be avoided until it is clear that they do not simply remove the WMH or alter their apparent distribution.

Figure 10
Effect of incautious use of bias field correction on cortical infarct and WMH. The left image shows the original MR FLAIR image with a right frontal cortical infarct (arrow) and numerous WMH. Following bias field correction (left) the frontal infarct appears much smaller, some of the WMH have become more (eg, posterior areas) and some now appear split into smaller components (mid centrum semiovale) as the bias field smoothing software tries to "even out" the distribution of signal intensities across the image. FLAIR indicates fluid attenuation inversion recovery; MR, magnetic resonance; WMH, white matter hyperintensities.

Two final features of WMH that have been overlooked to date are (1) the presence of ill-defined subtle hyperintense white matter that are non-continuous and diffuse, with varying erratic intensity patterns emerging from the lateral ventricle walls, sometimes known as "dirty white matter"and which may be an indicator of pre-lesional changes (Figure 5); and (2) the fact that WMH can get smaller or disappear rather than continuously enlarging (Figure 1). "Dirty white matter" is probably a real feature indicating subtle tissue damage, as suggested by the signal change in Figure 5. It will influence where the boundary of the WMH is set and hence associations with other MR parameters like FA and MD.

### Prevention of stroke in patients with silent cerebrovascular disease: a scientific statement for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^2970ee61]. Stroke (2017). Medium credibility.

American Heart Association/American Stroke Association statement — radiological diagnosis of silent brain infarcts notes cerebral small vessel disease accounts for the majority (85%–90%) of silent cerebrovascular disease, whereas a minority (10%–15%) manifests as cortical infarcts or larger (> 15 mm) subcortical infarcts; most silent brain infarcts (80%–90%) are subcortical. Differentiation from perivascular spaces uses size ≥ 3 mm, shape, and location, with spaces common in basal ganglia and corona radiata but rarely in pons, medulla, or cerebellum so lesions there are more likely infarcts. Small subcortical infarcts 3 to 15 mm are termed lacunar infarcts or lacunes of presumed vascular origin, whereas lesions exceeding > 15 mm axial diameter may have diverse causes including large artery disease or embolism. Higher-field-strength 3 T MRI with high spatial resolution (eg, ≤ 1.5-mm slice thickness) may reveal very small (< 3 mm) cortical ribbon infarcts, and although ≥ 3 mm increases specificity for infarction versus perivascular space, neuropathological studies frequently identify much smaller microinfarcts not seen on routine imaging.

### Are multiple acute small subcortical infarctions caused by embolic mechanisms? [^409146c9]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To seek evidence of potential embolic sources or other stroke mechanisms in patients who, on chance observation, had several apparently recent small subcortical infarcts on diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI).

Methods

Patients presenting with stroke and multiple hyperintense subcortical infarcts visible on DWI were identified prospectively. Detailed clinical and radiological assessments were done independently and blinded to each other.

Results

Of 10 patients with multiple hyperintense subcortical infarcts on DWI, a definite embolic source was identified in only one. Most patients were hypertensive and smoked. The DWI appearance suggested that the subcortical lesions had occurred within several weeks rather than at exactly the same time. Most patients also had significant white matter hyperintensities and four had microhaemorrhages.

Conclusions

Embolic sources were not identified in most patients but they did have systemic vascular risk factors and brain imaging features of "small vessel disease". A more generalised intrinsic process affecting many small cerebral vessels contemporaneously could explain multiple acute small subcortical infarcts. White matter hyperintensities, microhaemorrhages, and multiple small subcortical infarcts may share a common pathophysiological mechanism such as a diffuse cerebral microvascular abnormality which requires further exploration.

### Brain MRI findings and their association with visual impairment in young adolescents born very preterm [^91fe0aea]. Neuroradiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Brain MRI findings

A total of 15 (32%) children born very preterm had focal WMI: 5 (11%) had small punctate high signal lesions, and 10 (21%) had confluent high signal intensities in the white matter. No child had cystic lesions. Among full-term controls, 1 (5%) child had punctate high signal lesions. None of the focal white matter lesions were found in the optic radiation but were located in the frontal and parietal white matter regions. No control children had confluent high signal intensities or cystic lesions. There were no signs of previous hemorrhage or infarcts in either the preterm children or in full-term controls.

The mean values of Evans index, posterior ventricle index, peritrigonal white matter, corpus callosum area, and posterior corpus callosum area are presented in Table 2. Evans index (0.27 vs 0.25, p < 0.001) and posterior ventricle index (0.47 vs 0.45, p = 0.02) were larger in children born very preterm than in controls. We calculated lower estimates for posterior corpus callosum area in the preterm born children, but this difference did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.08). Higher gestational age was associated with larger corpus callosum area (β = 10.7, 95% CI 0.59–20.8) but not with other brain measurements in children born very preterm. The optic nerves were significantly decreased among the study children compared to the controls (4.49 vs. 4.12, p < 0.001). No significant difference was found for the chiasma. The interrater agreement, estimated with the intraclass correlation coefficient, was 0.77, 0.54, 0.80, and 0.71 for the Evan's index, posterior ventricle index, corpus callosum, and posterior corpus callosum, respectively. The intraclass correlation coefficient for peritrigonal white matter thickness was 0.14 and 0.20 for the right and left sides, respectively. For the chiasma, the intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.47 and for the mean of the optic nerve 0.77.

### Incidental multifocal white matter lesions in pediatric magnetic resonance imaging [^3d0e338d]. Pediatric Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

This study sought to describe the occurrence and potential significance of white matter abnormalities of unknown cause on pediatric cranial magnetic resonance scans, and to review the literature. We included 16 children in whom white matter abnormalities were incidentally revealed on magnetic resonance scans performed during a 7-year period at a tertiary pediatric medical center. Background data were retrospectively collected from medical files. White matter lesions were classified by size, location, and extent. Indications for imaging included convulsive disorder (n = 5), headache (n = 5), endocrine disorder (n = 4), and others. Patients' abnormalities did not correlate with the locations and patterns of white matter lesions. No changes in lesions were evident over time. Given the absence of evident benefits from repeated imaging studies, we suggest they are not warranted in every patient, and should be tailored according to clinical course. Further investigations of incidental intracranial findings are required in this age group.

### Diffusion and ADC-map images detect ongoing demyelination on subcortical white matter in an adult metachromatic leukodystrophy patient with autoimmune hashimoto thyroiditis [^9b786293]. BMJ Case Reports (2010). Medium credibility.

Adult-onset metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) often shows schizophrenia- or encephalopathy-like symptoms at an early stage, such as behavioural abnormalities, cognitive impairment, mood disorders and hallucinations. The authors report the case of an adult woman with MLD who had been given antipsychotic medication for schizophrenia. In the differential diagnosis, screening of auto-antibodies was important for ruling out other encephalopathies as she had a euthyroid Hashimoto thyroiditis. Diagnosis was based the results of MRI, nerve conduction velocity, sensory evoked potential, motor evoked potential, lysosomal enzyme activity and gene analysis studies. Brain MRI showed diffuse demyelination spreading from the deep white matter to subcortical area as high signals at the edges of these lesions in diffusion and apparent diffusion coefficient-map images with the U-fibres conserved. The authors diagnosed adult-onset MLD coexisting with euthyroid autoimmune Hashimoto thyroiditis.

### Prevalence and significance of the vessel-cluster sign on susceptibility-weighted imaging in patients with severe small vessel disease [^13f7e333]. Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

The identification of the vessel-clusters on SWI is based on the assumption that small parenchymal vessels may be visualized as low signal (dark) if they contain deoxygenated hemoglobin due to the latter's paramagnetic distortion of the magnetic field. In this way, typically, normal small deep cerebral venules can be visualized on SWI. In this study, we described focal alterations on SWI appearing as small abnormal dilated vessels associated with focal white matter degeneration in SVD. It is possible that other paramagnetic elements may produce a dark signal on SWI in the brain in SVD. Small amounts of hemosiderin are commonly present in or at the edges of lacunes in the brain representing petechial hemorrhage as part of the natural history of ischemic stroke, which would be consistent with the rim-like distribution on the wall of complete cavities in some cases of our cohort (Figure 1C). However, it is also possible that residual vessels may persist on the edges of lacunes. Small platelet-erythrocyte aggregates containing deoxygenated hemoglobin could also produce similar artifacts on gradient-echo–based imaging, as described in small subcortical infarcts, and it is conceivable that local thrombosis could be triggered by slow blood flow and endothelial dysfunction. Tissue interfaces may also cause magnetic field effects (i.e. between a cavity and tissue) but are likely to be more subtle than those identified as vessel-clusters (eFigure 3, A, D). Finally, the SWI signal may overestimate the true size of a paramagnetic structure due to blooming artefact, meaning that the actual size of the vessel-like structures in the SWI vessel-clusters may be much smaller than depicted on MRI. Nevertheless, the traceable appearance of small tubular structures through contiguous axial planes, some of them finally draining to the deep venous system (Figure 4), makes these findings hard to be interpreted with an alternative hypothesis other than dilated disorganized small vessels, possibly originally arterioles or venules or something in between, corresponding to white matter injury.

### Assessment of lesions on magnetic resonance imaging in multiple sclerosis: practical guidelines [^1cd43c21]. Brain (2019). Medium credibility.

Juxtacortical or cortical lesions

A juxtacortical lesion is defined as a T 2 -hyperintense white matter lesion abutting, i.e. in direct contact with, the cortex without intervening normal white matter. They are best detected using a T 2 -FLAIR sequence (preferably 3D). In multiple sclerosis, juxtacortical lesions typically involve the U-fibres and can be located in all brain lobes and in the cerebellum (Fig. 2 and Table 2).

Figure 2
Characteristics of cortical/juxtacortical multiple sclerosis that are typical ('green flags') and atypical ('red flags'), as well as those that should not be included. Top left: Green flags: examples of (A) juxtacortical lesions and (B) cortical lesions suggestive of multiple sclerosis. Top right: (C) white matter lesions not touching the cortex or within the cortex (subcortical). Bottom: Red flags: (D) multiple white matter lesions involving subcortical and deep white matter, suggestive of small-vessel disease; (E) lesions involving the grey matter-white matter border of different brain lobes with ill-defined borders in progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy; (F) multiple well-defined CSF-like abnormalities that appear as dots or stripes in enlarged Virchow-Robin space; (G) hypointensity on T 2 -weighted sequence suggesting haemosiderin deposit due to a microbleed; (H) multiple leptomeningeal/cortical hyperintensities on T 1 -weighted imaging with associated hypointensity on gradient-echo sequence in CNS vasculitis. JC/CL = juxtacortical/cortical.

### Metric to quantify white matter damage on brain magnetic resonance images [^1c3e9e9f]. Neuroradiology (2017). Low credibility.

Subtle FLAIR/T2 W WMH have received special attention as they may indicate pre-lesional tissue changes, but are difficult to quantify as they may extend over large regions, and lack a clear boundary. Thus they often appear included in "normal-appearing" white matter (NAWM). NAWM is defined as having intensities from 50 to 75% of the maximum intensity value on a T2 W-based sequence (e.g. T2 W and/or FLAIR), and are coincident with the regions classed as white matter on the human brain atlas, after excluding stroke lesions and WMH. When the signal strength of the WMH is high, then subtle ('pre-lesional') WMH could be classed as "normal" tissue and, therefore, disregarded from an evolving pathological process. Hence, it may be necessary to weight the quantitative WMH volumes (obtained from any quantification technique) by a factor that expresses the relationship between the signal strength of the regions considered WMH by the segmentation method and that of the other regions considered "normal". This might capture the more subtle features and thus provide a more complete index of total brain injury from WMH. We propose and validate a metric to quantitatively express the white matter (WM) damage to address this need.
