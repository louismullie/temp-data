## Question

the patient took his last dose of apixaban, clopidogreL this morning, how long would we have to hold them for procedure?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how long to hold apixaban and clopidogrel before a procedure, given that both were taken this morning. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacokinetics of apixaban and clopidogrel. Then, I should verify how procedural bleeding risk is categorized and why that matters. Next, I will apply guideline-based interruption intervals for each drug by risk category, consider renal function nuances, and account for the additive bleeding risk of dual therapy. Finally, I will synthesize a practical recommendation and confirm post-procedural resumption plans, making sure I double-check any conflicting guidance along the way.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacology and half-lives, because the hold times hinge on them. Apixaban is a direct factor Xa inhibitor with a half-life of about 8–15 hours and peak effect 1–3 hours, and it is partially renally cleared, which can prolong effect in kidney dysfunction, whereas clopidogrel is a thienopyridine with irreversible platelet effects and a functional half-life of roughly 7–10 days, meaning platelet recovery requires new platelet generation rather than drug clearance alone [^d733b2aa] [^f2ba4db8] [^222888be].

> Wait, let me verify the procedural risk framework before assigning days. Major guidelines stratify procedures into high, low-to-moderate, and minimal bleeding risk, and they align preoperative interruption with this risk tier because high-bleed-risk procedures generally require minimal to no residual anticoagulant effect, whereas low-to-moderate risk procedures tolerate some residual effect, and minimal-risk procedures can often proceed without interruption [^f307300c] [^4d936dfe].

> I will now examine apixaban interruption by risk category. For high-bleed-risk procedures, hold apixaban for 2 full days (about 4–5 half-lives) to ensure minimal residual effect, and for low-to-moderate-bleed-risk procedures, hold for 1 full day (about 2–3 half-lives). Critically, no dose is taken on the day of the procedure, and these intervals assume normal renal function, with longer holds considered if kidney function is impaired or if interacting drugs are present [^4d936dfe] [^d733b2aa] [^ae0a7074].

> Hold on, I should verify renal function considerations because they can change apixaban timing. In moderate-to-severe CKD, some guidance extends interruption beyond the standard 1–2 days, and in advanced CKD cohorts, clinicians have used median interruption intervals around 84 hours (about 3.5 days) for both low and high-bleed-risk procedures, though this is more conservative than standard guidance and should be individualized; if CrCl is 15–30 mL/min, some kidney guidelines advise extending to 36–48 hours before low and high-risk procedures, respectively, so I need to check the patient's eGFR before finalizing [^de202994] [^2cc00731].

> Next, I should review clopidogrel interruption. For elective procedures, clopidogrel is generally held for 5 days to allow platelet recovery, with 7 days for prasugrel and 3–5 days for ticagrelor; importantly, aspirin is often continued if clinically indicated, and this 5-day clopidogrel hold applies across minor and major procedures unless the thrombotic risk is very high and a cardiology-directed exception is made [^e163e005] [^0173a3b0] [^05b7bac2].

> But wait, what if the patient is on dual therapy and we are combining a DOAC with a P2Y12 inhibitor. I need to ensure we account for additive bleeding risk. The combination of apixaban and clopidogrel increases bleeding risk compared with either alone, so even when each drug's individual hold is borderline, the synergistic effect justifies adhering to the longer, standard holds rather than shortening them, and there is no role for routine bridging with heparin for DOAC interruption in elective settings [^2f6b0aa8] [^4d936dfe].

> Let me synthesize the practical answer now. If today is Day 0 and both apixaban and clopidogrel were taken this morning, then for a high-bleed-risk procedure, the last dose of both should have been 2 days ago, so the earliest safe date would be Day 2 from today, with no morning dose on procedure day. For a low-to-moderate-bleed-risk procedure, the earliest safe date would be tomorrow, Day 1, again with no morning dose on procedure day. If the patient has significant renal impairment, I should extend the apixaban hold by an extra day or two based on kidney function and local protocol, and if the thrombotic risk is very high, I should coordinate with cardiology to decide whether to continue aspirin and consider procedural strategies to mitigate bleeding [^4d936dfe] [^d733b2aa] [^2cc00731].

> I should double-check post-procedural resumption before concluding. DOACs are generally resumed 24–48 hours after low-to-moderate-bleed-risk procedures once hemostasis is secure, and 48–72 hours after high-bleed-risk procedures, whereas antiplatelet therapy can often be resumed within 24 hours if hemostasis is adequate, though this should be individualized to thrombotic and bleeding risks; bridging is not routinely needed for DOACs [^d70a4ab3] [^notfound].

> In summary, assuming normal renal function and that both agents were taken this morning, hold apixaban and clopidogrel for 2 full days before high-bleed-risk procedures and 1 full day before low-to-moderate-bleed-risk procedures, with no dose on the day of the procedure, and extend apixaban interruption if kidney function is reduced or if interacting drugs are present. I need to check the patient's eGFR and the exact procedure risk before finalizing the calendar date and coordinate with the procedural team and prescribing clinicians for post-procedural resumption plans [^4d936dfe] [^d733b2aa] [^2cc00731].

Hold apixaban for **24 hours before low-to-moderate bleeding risk procedures** and **48 hours before high bleeding risk procedures** [^4d936dfe] [^d733b2aa]. Hold clopidogrel for **5 days before elective procedures** [^e163e005] [^0173a3b0]. These intervals assume normal renal function; extend apixaban to 48–72 hours if CrCl is 30–50 mL/min and consider longer holds if CrCl is < 30 mL/min. Bridging is not routinely needed for either agent [^4d936dfe] [^2cc00731]. Resume both agents 24–48 hours post-procedure once hemostasis is secure [^d70a4ab3] [^4c8b9a51].

---

## Pharmacokinetic considerations

### Apixaban

- **Half-life**: 8–15 hours [^d733b2aa] [^ae0a7074].
- **Peak effect**: 1–3 hours after dosing [^f2ba4db8].
- **Renal elimination**: ~25% [^f2ba4db8]; impaired renal function prolongs effect [^d001c9b8].

---

### Clopidogrel

- **Half-life**: ~6 hours, but irreversible platelet inhibition lasts 5–7 days [^notfound].
- **Peak effect**: 2–4 hours after dosing [^notfound].
- **Metabolism**: Hepatic; active metabolite irreversibly inhibits platelets [^notfound].

## Clinical guidelines for perioperative management

### Apixaban

| **Procedure bleeding risk** | **Recommended interruption** |
|-|-|
| Low-to-moderate risk | Stop 24 hours before procedure [^4d936dfe] [^d733b2aa] |
| High risk | Stop 48 hours before procedure [^4d936dfe] [^d733b2aa] |

---

For **renal impairment**, extend to 48–72 hours if CrCl is 30–50 mL/min; consider longer if CrCl is < 30 mL/min [^2cc00731] [^de202994].

---

### Clopidogrel

For **elective procedures**, stop 5 days before the procedure [^e163e005] [^0173a3b0]. For **urgent procedures**, consider shorter holds with cardiology input if thrombotic risk is high.

---

## Combined anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy

Combined therapy increases bleeding risk; **individualize decisions** based on thrombotic and bleeding risk [^2f6b0aa8]. Bridging is not routinely recommended for either agent [^4d936dfe] [^2cc00731].

---

## Post-procedural resumption

Resume both agents **24–48 hours post-procedure** once hemostasis is secure [^d70a4ab3] [^4c8b9a51].

---

## Special considerations

- **Neuraxial anesthesia**: Hold apixaban 48–72 hours; clopidogrel 5–7 days [^f9c7c1a9].
- **Renal impairment**: Adjust apixaban hold as above [^2cc00731] [^de202994].
- **Urgent procedures**: Use clinical judgment and consider reversal strategies if needed [^f4d026b0].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Medication** | **Low-to-moderate risk procedure** | **High risk procedure** |
|-|-|-|
| Apixaban | Stop 24 hours before | Stop 48 hours before |
| Clopidogrel | Stop 5 days before | Stop 5 days before |

---

Hold apixaban for **24–48 hours** and clopidogrel for **5 days** before procedures, adjusting for renal function and procedural risk; resume both 24–48 hours after hemostasis.

ASIPP 2024 — Timing of anticoagulant interruption and restart for surgery is outlined as follows: Recommendations state aspirin is continued for all types of surgeries, and Rivaroxaban (Xarelto), Apixaban (Eliquis), and Edoxaban (Savaysa, Lixiana) are stopped for 24 h before minor surgery and 48 h before major surgery, while clopidogrel (Plavix), prasugrel (Effient), and ticagrelor (Brilinta) are held for 5–7 days. Table-based examples specify drug-specific withholding and restart intervals: Warfarin (Coumadin) half-life 20–60 h, withhold 3–5 days for minor or major surgery, restart 24 h after minor surgery (overlapping therapy with heparin) and 48–72 h after major surgery (overlapping therapy with heparin); Apixaban (Eliquis) half-life 8–15 h, withhold 24 h for minor and 48 h for major surgery, restart 24 h after minor and 24–48 h after major surgery; Dabigatran (Pradaxa) half-life 12–17 h uses creatinine clearance (CrCl) to guide withholding (CrCl ≥ 50 mL: 24 h for minor, 72 h for major; CrCl < 50 mL: 75 h for minor, 120 h for major) and restart 24 h after minor or 24–48 h after major surgery; Aspirin half-life 7–10 days is "usually continued" and "usually continued" for restart; Clopidogrel (Plavix) half-life 7–10 days, withhold 5–7 days for minor or major surgery, restart 24 h after minor and 24–48 h after major surgery; Ticagrelor (Brilinta) half-life 5–7 days, withhold 3–5 days for minor or major surgery, restart 24 h after minor and 24–48 h after major surgery. In case of impaired renal function, withholding intervals for several agents should be prolonged and/or drug levels evaluated.

Pharmacology in patients in atrial fibrillation on existing anticoagulants undergoing PCI

The main focus in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) is stroke prevention. Several trialsguide therapy in this population with all powered for bleeding endpoints compared with vitamin K antagonist (VKA) and not for ischaemic or stroke prevention.

The WOEST study demonstrated safety of using a combination of clopidogrel and warfarin alone in terms of thrombotic events with reduced overall bleeding risk. The PIONEERRE-DUAL, AUGUSTUSand ENTRUSTtrials further reinforced the concept of redundancy of aspirin due to increased bleeding in patients with AF treated with anticoagulant and P2Y12 inhibitor. The AUGUSTUS trial used a factorial design to specifically evaluate a single P2Y12 inhibitor with an anticoagulant versus triple therapy with aspirin. This trial confirmed first, superiority of apixaban over VKA in reducing bleeding and second, similar efficacy but less bleeding with dual therapy (apixaban and P2Y12 with > 92% of patients on clopidogrel).

Pretreatment

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) should be withheld for 24 hours (48 hours for those with renal impairment on dabigatran – creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min). For patients on VKA, this does not need to be interruptedbut US guidelines recommend a washout period before PCI using preferably, radial access when international normalised ratio (INR) ≤ 2 (or if femoral when INR ≤ 1.5).

As there is scant evidence for preloading with P2Y12 antiplatelet agents, patients on oral anticoagulants should only receive treatment once coronary anatomy is known and decision made to proceed to PCI. The overwhelming trial evidence is to give clopidogrel (300 mg) in-laboratory.

Patients presenting with NSTE-ACS on DOAC should stop treatment for 24 hours before PCI. If the clinical situation demands urgent revascularisation (eg, STEMI), then studies suggest that an uninterrupted strategy is not associated with increased bleeding or major cardiovascular events compared with bridging therapy.

Guideline scope — elective perioperative antithrombotic management pertains to patients receiving anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy who require an elective, non-urgent surgery/procedure and does not address patients who require an urgent surgery/procedure; it further pertains to patients receiving long-term, typically ≥ 3 months, antithrombotic therapy and focuses on VKAs (warfarin), DOACs (apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, rivaroxaban), and antiplatelet drugs (aspirin [ASA], clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticagrelor). It does not address drugs with anticoagulant or antiplatelet properties used infrequently, low-dose DOAC regimens (eg, rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid) or drugs used for short periods, and it does not address the perioperative use of low-dose LMWHs, low-dose DOACs, or other antithrombotic strategies intended as prophylaxis against postoperative VTE.

### The bridging conundrum: perioperative management of direct oral anticoagulants for venous thromboembolism [^003f316d]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2023). Medium credibility.

Most patients diagnosed with venous thromboembolism (VTE) are currently treated with direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). Before an invasive procedure or surgery, clinicians face the challenging decision of how to best manage DOACs. Should the DOAC be held, for how long, and are there instances where bridging with other anticoagulants should be considered? Although clinical trials indicate that most patients taking DOACs for atrial fibrillation do not require bridging anticoagulation, the optimal strategy for patients with a history of VTE is undefined. In this review, we present a case-based discussion for DOAC interruption perioperatively in patients receiving anticoagulation for management of VTE.

### Endoscopy in patients on antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy: British society of gastroenterology (BSG) and European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) guideline update [^60a1831c]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants

For low-risk endoscopic procedures we suggest omitting the morning dose of DOACs on the day of the procedure (weak recommendation, low quality evidence).

For high-risk endoscopic procedures in patients on DOACs, we recommend that the last dose of DOACs be taken 3 days before the procedure (strong recommendation. low quality evidence). For patients on dabigatran with a CrCl (or eGFR) of 30–50 mL/min we recommend that the last dose be taken 5 days prior to the procedure (strong recommendation, low quality evidence). In any patient with rapidly deteriorating renal function a haematologist should be consulted (strong recommendation, low quality evidence).

DOACs have been a major advance in anticoagulant therapy. Dabigatran is an inhibitor of thrombin, and rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban inhibit FXa. They do not need routine monitoring, and INR and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) are unreliable indicators of anticoagulant activity. Unlike warfarin they have a rapid onset of action and full anticoagulant activity is established within 3 hours of the first dose. They have relatively short half-lives, but these may be prolonged in renal failure, particularly for dabigatran. In patients undergoing a high-risk procedure with a low thrombotic risk we recommend that the last dose of rivaroxaban, apixaban or edoxaban is taken 3 days before the procedure. Dabigatran may have to be stopped for longer than this, however, when renal function is significantly reduced.

### To hold or continue blood thinners? A retrospective analysis on outcomes of holmium laser enucleation of the prostate in patients who either held or continued antiplatelet / anticoagulation therapy [^44f4f302]. Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To compare the outcomes between those who held or continued antiplatelet or anticoagulation therapy (APAC) for holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP).

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed patients on APAC who underwent HoLEP between January 2021 and August 2023 by a single surgeon at a high-volume center. APAC was further categorized to the specific medication: clopidogrel, apixaban, warfarin, rivaroxaban. Preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative characteristics and outcomes were then compared. SPSS was used for statistical analysis with significance defined as P < .05.

Results

One hundred thirty-nine patients were on APAC, of which 82 held and 57 continued APAC: 38 on clopidogrel (21 held), 20 on warfarin (11 held), 57 on apixaban (34 held), 24 on rivaroxaban (16 held). Overall, there were no significant differences between those who held versus those who continued APAC. On sub-analysis, controlling for age and prostate size, patients who held clopidogrel had shorter length of stays (11.3 hours vs 27.3 hours, P = 0.016), higher likelihood for same-day catheter removal (90.5% vs 47.1%, P = 0.002) and same-day discharge (90.5% vs 35.3%, P = 0.002). Patients who held warfarin had shorter procedure (61.3 minutes vs 92.2 minutes, P = 0.025) and morcellation time (7.36 minutes vs 18 minutes, P = 0.048).

Conclusion

HoLEP is safe and efficacious in patients whether APAC is held or continued through surgery. Holding APAC in those on clopidogrel may decrease length of stay and improve rates of same-day Foley removal and discharge. Patients who held warfarin had shorter morcellation and procedure times.

Table 18 — recommended preoperative withholding and restart times for oral antiplatelet and anticoagulant drugs provide drug-specific half-lives and timing by surgical risk. Warfarin (Coumadin) half-life 20–60 h: withhold 3–5 days* before minor and 3–5 days before major surgery; restart 24 h, overlapping therapy with heparin after minor and 48–72 h; overlapping therapy with heparin after major. Apixaban (Eliquis) half-life 8–15 h: withhold 24 h** before minor and 48 h** before major; restart 24 h after minor and 24–48 h after major. Rivaroxaban (Xarelto) half-life 5–9 h (Elderly: 11–13 h): withhold 24 h** before minor and 48 h** before major; restart 24 h after minor and 24–48 h after major. Dabigatran (Pradaxa) half-life 12–17 h: for minor, CrCl (creatinine clearance) ≥ 50 mL: 24 h and CrCl < 50 mL: 72 h; for major, CrCl ≥ 50 mL: 72 h and CrCl < 50 mL: 120 h; restart 24 h after minor and 24–48 h after major. Aspirin half-life 7–10 days: usually continued for both withholding and restart. Clopidogrel (Plavix) half-life 7–10 days: withhold 5–7 days before minor and 5–7 days before major; restart 24 h after minor and 24–48 h after major. Ticagrelor (Brilinta) half-life 5–7 days: withhold 3–5 days before minor and 3–5 days before major; restart 24 h after minor and 24–48 h after major. Footnotes qualify that "In some cases, continued drug administration is feasible" and "In case of impaired renal function, withholding interval should be prolonged and/or drug level should be evaluated by laboratory tests", and the table defines "CrCl: creatinine clearance".

### Antithrombotic regimens for patients taking oral anticoagulation after coronary intervention: a meta-analysis of 16 clinical trials and 9, 185 patients [^f374f619]. Clinical Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Several questions remain unanswered. First, there are insufficient data to assess the optimal duration of triple and dual therapy regimens. Most guidelines recommended triple therapy for 3 to 6 months, depending on stent type and bleeding risk of patients, 10, 11 but it is really unknown whether shorter duration of triple therapy is also effective with the new generation of stent implantation. The second unanswered question focuses on how to overcome the resistance to clopidogrel. Newer P2Y 12 inhibitors (prasugrel and ticagrelor) might be good alternatives for reducing thrombosis risk, but the paucity of data supports the combination of OAC and newer P2Y 12 inhibitors, and more major bleeding events could also be the hidden trouble. The third dilemma is the type and dose of OAC to optimize the risk/benefit ratio. Current recommendations advise keeping the INR between 2.0 and 2.5 instead of 2.0 to 3.0, concerning the bleeding risk with the combination of warfarin and antiplatelet therapy. 10, 11 Novel oral anticoagulants such as dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban have demonstrated their superiority over warfarin in patients with AF, and these might be the optimal choice to replace warfarin to combine DAPT or clopidogrel to improve the risk/benefit ratio. However, none of these novel oral anticoagulants have been tested in AF patients who need coronary stenting, and several ongoing trials could provide more information to guide future clinical practice.

Study Limitations

Our study has several limitations. First, this meta‐analysis is not based on individual patient data. Second, different studies used different bleeding definitions, as noted in our results, which might be an important source of bias. Third, lack of other potential confounding factors, such as the periprocedural use of bridging therapy, duration of triple and dual therapy, and INR values during follow‐up, did not allow us to investigate the detailed impact of antithrombotic regimens on clinical endpoints and the underlying mechanisms. Finally, the follow‐up period in all enrolled studies was relatively different for comparison of triple therapy vs dual therapy.

Table 2
Clinical Characteristics Benefiting From Extended‐Duration DAPT

In summary, prolonged DAPT appears more beneficial in patients with ACS treated with ticagrelor or prasugrel, with risk factors for recurrent ischemia at a cost of increased bleeding. However, any clinician will also recognize that not all bleeding or ACS events carry the same risk. Indeed, a clinician‐patient shared decision making seems apt when discussing the optimal duration of DAPT. On the other hand, the clinician must also remember that trials evaluating DAPT over 5 years are currently lacking. Therefore, although possibly beneficial, any DAPT beyond this time period has no strong clinical evidence. With the continuous medication and stent advances, the optimal DAPT duration will likely be altered, but until then the current guidelines supporting DAPT duration of 12 months in ACS with further tailoring of therapy based on an individual risk of further ischemic or bleeding events provide an excellent framework to begin. Evolving research will help us further understand the risks and benefits of extended‐duration DAPT, especially with the newer‐generation stents.

Prevention

Correct coagulopathy before the procedure: recommended threshold for the procedure is a platelet count of 50 000/µL and International Normalized Ratio (INR) < 1.5.
Patients on P2Y12 receptor antagonist antiplatelet agents with low thrombotic risk: Discontinue P2Y12 receptor antagonists (clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticagrelor) 5 days before the procedure. Low-dose aspirin is no contraindication and should not be discontinued.
Patients on P2Y12 receptor antagonist antiplatelet agents with high thrombotic risk (coronary artery stents): Continue aspirin and liaise with a cardiologist about the risk/benefit of discontinuation of P2Y12 receptor antagonist.
Patients on direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC): Discontinue DOAC (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban) ≥ 48 hours before the procedure. For dabigatran with Creatinine Clearance (CrCl) estimated Glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 30–50 mL/min take last dose of drug 72 hours before procedure.
Patients on warfarin with low-risk condition: Stop warfarin 5 days before the procedure. Check International Normalized Ratio (INR) prior to procedure to ensure International Normalized Ratio (INR) < 1.5. Restart warfarin evening of procedure with usual daily dose. Check International Normalized Ratio (INR) 1 week later to ensure adequate anticoagulation.
Patients on warfarin with high-risk condition: Stop warfarin 5 days before the procedure. Start Low Molecular Weight Heparine(LMWH) 2 days after stopping warfarin. Give last dose of Low Molecular Weight Heparine (LMWH) ≥ 24 hours before the procedure. Restart warfarin evening of procedure with usual daily dose. Continue Low Molecular Weight Heparine (LMWH) until International Normalized Ratio (INR) adequate.

Management options

For superficial bleeding: tighten the bumper to apply direct pressure but don't forget to release it within 24–48 hours to avoid pressure damage.
In more complicated cases or persisting bleeding: repeat endoscopy.
Rarely surgical intervention will be necessary.

Regarding perioperative care for periprocedural management of antithrombotic therapy, more specifically with respect to patients on DOACs, ACCP 2022 guidelines recommend to consider stopping apixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban for 1–2 days before surgery/procedure in patients receiving any of these agents requiring elective surgery/procedure.

### How I treat anticoagulated patients undergoing an elective procedure or surgery [^04fb5c27]. Blood (2012). Low credibility.

The periprocedural management of patients receiving long-term oral anticoagulant therapy remains a common but difficult clinical problem, with a lack of high-quality evidence to inform best practices. It is a patient's thromboembolic risk that drives the need for an aggressive periprocedural strategy, including the use of heparin bridging therapy, to minimize time off anticoagulant therapy, while the procedural bleed risk determines how and when postprocedural anticoagulant therapy should be resumed. Warfarin should be continued in patients undergoing selected minor procedures, whereas in major procedures that necessitate warfarin interruption, heparin bridging therapy should be considered in patients at high thromboembolic risk and in a minority of patients at moderate risk. Periprocedural data with the novel oral anticoagulants, such as dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban, are emerging, but their relatively short half-life, rapid onset of action, and predictable pharmacokinetics should simplify periprocedural use. This review aims to provide a practical, clinician-focused approach to periprocedural anticoagulant management.

Antithrombotic drugs including vitamin K antagonists (VKAs; warfarin and acenocoumarol), direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs; apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban), antiplatelet drugs such as the P2Y 12 receptor inhibitors (clopidogrel, prasugrel, and ticagrelor), and acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) are used in the management of patients with atrial fibrillation, ischemic heart disease, venous thromboembolism, and valvular heart disease. These drugs also increase the risk of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding from luminal sources such as ulcers or diverticula and after endoscopic procedures. Standardized, evidence-based protocols are lacking to inform best practices before and after endoscopic procedures in urgent and elective settings. Furthermore, uncertainty regarding best practice recommendations and associated levels of evidence has led to significant variation in adherence to guideline-directed practices.

The American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) and the Canadian Association of Gastroenterology (CAG) convened an international, multisociety, and multidisciplinary working group to create a focused, pragmatic guideline after distillation of published literature to inform clinical practice in the periendoscopic period. In keeping with the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) approach, the most pertinent clinical questions guided the systematic review of the literature, with the resulting rigorous methodological evaluation of the available published data informing recommendations. In this document, we propose an evidence-based approach to periprocedural antithrombotic drug management in common emergent and elective settings addressing clinical questions related to (i) temporary interruption of anticoagulant and antiplatelet drugs; (ii) reversal of anticoagulant and antiplatelet drugs; (iii) periprocedural heparin bridging; and (iv) postprocedural resumption of anticoagulant and antiplatelet drugs.

This document does not cover all possible clinical situations where multidisciplinary guidance may be necessary to manage periendoscopic antithrombotic therapy. Nor does it address the rapidly evolving menu of endoscopic approaches developed to minimize intraprocedural and postprocedural bleeding in situations such as removing large colonic polyps. Because of insufficient evidence, the panel could not recommend a best practice for all clinical questions. These clinical situations are identified as priorities for future research.

Methods

The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analyses guidelines (Table S1) were used in this systematic review and network meta‐analysis. 14 The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.

Data Sources

The Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane database were independently searched by 2 reviewers. The search terms were "coronary artery disease", "coronary heart disease", "chronic coronary syndrome", "myocardial infarction", "acute coronary syndrome", "percutaneous coronary intervention", "coronary artery bypass grafting", "coronary stenting" paired with "aspirin", "clopidogrel", "prasugrel", "ticagrelor", "P2Y12 inhibitors", "thienopyridine", "warfarin", "vitamin K antagonists", "dabigatran", "rivaroxaban", "apixaban", "edoxaban", "factor Xa inhibitor", or "new oral anticoagulants". Searches for studies published up to August 2020 were conducted using subject heading terms, key words, and titles or abstracts, and all identified abstracts were reasonably screened (Table S2).

Study Selection

An initial eligibility screen of all retrieved titles and abstracts was conducted, and original studies were included in our network meta‐analysis if they met the following criteria: (1) randomized controlled trial (RCT) accompanied by 2 or more arms; (2) subjects who experienced coronary revascularization < 1 year but were asymptomatic or stable; (3) subjects analyzed > 1 year after revascularization; (4) asymptomatic or stable subjects who underwent coronary angiography and showed at least one vessel with stenosis > 50% but did not undergo revascularization; (5) antithrombotic therapy, including anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy; (6) reported major cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACEs) and major bleeding accompanied by follow‐up events for more than 12 months.

The following exclusion criteria were used: (1) the default dual antiplatelet treatment duration was not completed, and (2) subjects who used oral anticoagulants or low molecular weight heparin for a long time before grouping.

Procedural Management

Past guidelines on perioperative and postoperative management for patients on DOACs have been primarily based on surgical risk (both thrombotic and bleeding), the DOAC's pharmacokinetic profile, concurrent medications, and patient characteristics (ie, comorbid diseases, history of bleeding complications, renal function, and age). 92, 93 Because of DOACs' fast onset and offset, periprocedural bridging is generally not required; however, it is important to note the length of time to hold regimens before and after procedures. Providers may find it useful to obtain specific coagulation measurements before procedures, especially in high‐risk interventions, to determine the level of hemostasis. However, for the majority of patients undergoing elective procedures, the interruption of DOAC therapy can be substantiated on a time‐based approach that takes into consideration bleeding risk of the procedure and renal function (see Table 8). 38, 93 Furthermore, the results of the ongoing PAUSE (Perioperative Anticoagulant Use for Surgery Evaluation; NCT02228798) will help to further define a more conclusive standard‐of‐care approach for perioperative management. 94

Studies assessing the risk of thrombosis and bleeding with interventional pain management procedures — mail-in survey (Manchikanti et al., 2024) of American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians members reported that 23% changed practice patterns, that all physicians discontinued warfarin with the majority accepting an international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.5, and detailed discontinuation practices: low-dose aspirin was discontinued for 3 to 7 days by 8% for low-risk, 34% for intermediate risk, and 76% for high-risk procedures; antiplatelet agents including dipyridamole, cilostazol, and Aggrenox were discontinued from 3 to 5 days by 18%-23% for low-risk, approximately 60% for intermediate-risk, and over 90% for high-risk procedures; platelet aggregation inhibitors (clopidogrel, Prasugrel, ticlopidine, ticagrelor) were discontinued for 3 to 5 days by approximately 26% to 41% for low-risk, almost 90% for intermediate-risk, and over 97% for high-risk procedures; and Anti-Xa agents (apixaban, rivaroxaban, and Edoxaban) were discontinued in over 25% for low-risk, approximately 90% for intermediate-risk, and 99% for high-risk procedures; the study authors stated that discontinuation patterns appear to fall within guidelines, with no description of thromboembolic phenomenon available and risks of thromboembolism not assessed.

### Gastrointestinal endoscopy in patients on anticoagulant therapy and antiplatelet agents [^46d28ead]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

DOACs

Because of their short half-life, DOACs can generally be continued until shortly before the procedure, and because of their rapid onset of action, therapeutic anticoagulation is achieved within a few hours of reinstituting treatment. These pharmacodynamic properties obviate the cost and inconvenience of "bridging anticoagulation" with heparin. In this regard, it is also worth noting that patients with the highest thrombotic risk (i.e. those with mechanical heart valve prostheses) are excluded from the DOACs indications.

In the case of low-risk elective GI procedures, such as endoscopy or colonoscopy with biopsy, the ASGE guidelines suggest continuing DOACs in the periendoscopic period, following the same management strategy as for VKAs. Safety concerns may arise in relation to this management strategy, when we consider that in a patient taking DOACs the intensity of anticoagulation may be relatively high compared to the average intensity at the peak levels, which is reached about 2–4 h after oral administration. Conversely, the procedure should ideally be performed when the DOAC is at trough levels, and the anticoagulant effect is relatively low. This means that the optimal procedure window is roughly 10 h after the last dose intake for the drugs given twice daily (dabigatran and apixaban), and 20 h for rivaroxaban, which is given once daily. On the basis of these considerations, and until further safety data in this specific situation become available, the ESGE guidelines suggest omitting the morning DOAC dose on the day of a low-risk procedure, so that biopsies can be sampled at a trough level.

Atrial fibrillation — timing of anticoagulant interruption before invasive procedures (Table 18): Apixaban is held 1 d before low bleeding risk procedures and 2 d before high bleeding risk procedures. Dabigatran with creatinine clearance (CrCl) > 50 mL/min is held 1 d for low risk and 2 d for high risk, and with CrCl 30–50 mL/min is held 2 d for low risk and 4 d for high risk. Edoxaban is held 1 d for low risk and 2 d for high risk. Rivaroxaban is held 1 d for low risk and 2 d for high risk. For warfarin, hold 5 d or for a target INR < 1.5; an alternative is 2–3 d for a target INR < 2. For patients with CrCl lower than the table values, the footnote states to consider holding for an additional 1 to 3 days, and it clarifies that the number of days refers to full days before surgery and the drug is also not taken the day of surgery.

MEDICATION GUIDE Apixaban Tablets (a PIX a ban)

What is the most important information I should know about apixaban tablets?

- **For people taking apixaban tablets for atrial fibrillation**: People with atrial fibrillation (a type of irregular heartbeat) are at an increased risk of forming a blood clot in the heart, which can travel to the brain, causing a stroke, or to other parts of the body. Apixaban tablets lowers your chance of having a stroke by helping to prevent clots from forming. If you stop taking apixaban tablets, you may have increased risk of forming a clot in your blood.

 Do not stop taking apixaban tablets without talking to the doctor who prescribes it for you. Stopping apixaban tablets increases your risk of having a stroke.

Apixaban tablets may need to be stopped, if possible, prior to surgery or a medical or dental procedure. Ask the doctor who prescribed apixaban tablets for you when you should stop taking it. Your doctor will tell you when you may start taking apixaban tablets again after your surgery or procedure. If you have to stop taking apixaban tablets, your doctor may prescribe another medicine to help prevent a blood clot from forming.

Background

Bleeding limits anticoagulant treatment in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS).

Objectives

We investigated whether background concomitant antiplatelet therapy influences the effects of apixaban after ACS.

Methods

This study examined high-risk ACS patients who were treated with aspirin or aspirin plus clopidogrel and who were randomized to apixaban 5 mg twice daily or placebo. In a post-hoc analysis, we assessed whether the effect of apixaban on efficacy and safety outcomes varied by the concomitant antiplatelet regimen by using simple Cox modeling and marginal structural models with propensity scores and antiplatelet therapy as a time-dependent covariate.

Results

At baseline, of 7,364 patients, 16.3% (n = 1,202) were on aspirin alone, and 79.0% (n = 5,814) were on aspirin plus clopidogrel. A total of 19.2% (n = 1,415) switched antiplatelet therapy during follow-up. No differential effect of apixaban versus placebo was observed for the composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and ischemic stroke in patients taking aspirin (12.21 per 100 patient-years vs. 13.21 per 100 patient-years; adjusted hazard ratio [HR]: 0.91; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.62 to 1.32) or aspirin plus clopidogrel (13.22 vs. 14.24; adjusted HR: 0.95; 95% CI: 0.78 to 1.14; p(interaction) = 0.84). Compared with placebo, apixaban increased Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction major bleeding in patients taking aspirin (1.48 vs. 0.25; adjusted HR: 6.62; 95% CI: 0.75 to 51.73) and in patients taking aspirin plus clopidogrel (2.58 vs. 1.02; adjusted HR: 2.44; 95% CI: 1.34 to 4.45; p(interaction) = 0.41). Similar results were obtained with marginal structural models and in patients treated with and without percutaneous coronary intervention.

Conclusions

Post-ACS treatment with apixaban versus placebo showed no efficacy, but it increased bleeding regardless of concomitant therapy with aspirin alone or aspirin plus clopidogrel. (Apixaban for Prevention of Acute Ischemic Events 2 [APPRAISE-2]; NCT00831441).

### Early aspirin discontinuation after coronary stenting: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^bc73c75a]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Patients assigned to control therapy received DAPT consisting of clopidogrel 75 mg once daily or ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily in combination with aspirin 75 to 200 mg once daily. Patients with an indication for OAC received either vitamin K antagonist or either apixaban or vitamin K antagonist in a random fashion in 2 trials. 6, 15 Comparative Effectiveness of 1 Month of Ticagrelor Plus Aspirin Followed by Ticagrelor Monotherapy Versus a Current‐day Intensive Dual Antiplatelet Therapy in All‐comers Patients Undergoing Percutaneous Coronary Intervention With Bivalirudin and BioMatrix Family Drug‐eluting Stent Use (GLOBAL LEADERS) trial had a peculiar design which deserves further description. The experimental therapy consisted of ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily in combination with aspirin 75 to 150 mg once daily for 1 month followed by ticagrelor monotherapy for 23 months. The control therapies consisted of clopidogrel 75 mg once daily or ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily (according to clinical presentation) in combination with aspirin 75 to 150 mg once daily for 12 months followed by aspirin 75 to 150 mg once daily for an additional 12 months. 4 Finally, the Ticagrelor With Aspirin or Alone in High‐Risk Patients After Coronary Intervention (TWILIGHT) trial randomized patients without bleeding or ischemic events 3 months after PCI to either continue ticagrelor as standalone therapy or DAPT (experimental and control therapy, respectively). 5

In 3 trials the predominant diagnosis at admission was ACS or stabilized MI. 5, 16, 18 In the experimental group, the adherence to assigned antiplatelet regimen at the longest available follow‐up ranged between 77.6% and 87.1%. All patients received ancillary therapies for acute or chronic manifestations of CAD in accordance with standard of care.

Baseline characteristics are shown in Table. Patients were more often male, had a median age of 65.1 years (interquartile range, 64.5–69.9), more than a third of them had diabetes mellitus, and nearly one‐fourth of them had a history of smoking at the time of inclusion in the primary trials. Approximately 50% of patients included presented with ACS. A previous MI was reported in 25.3% of patients, and 6.4% of patients have had cerebrovascular accidents before enrollment. The weighted median follow‐up available for the assessment of outcomes of interest was 12 months (mean 12.8 ± 5.3).

2.4 Temporary Interruption for Surgery and Other Interventions

ELIQUIS should be discontinued at least 48 hours prior to elective surgery or invasive procedures with a moderate or high risk of unacceptable or clinically significant bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. ELIQUIS should be discontinued at least 24 hours prior to elective surgery or invasive procedures with a low risk of bleeding or where the bleeding would be non-critical in location and easily controlled. Bridging anticoagulation during the 24 to 48 hours after stopping ELIQUIS and prior to the intervention is not generally required. ELIQUIS should be restarted after the surgical or other procedures as soon as adequate hemostasis has been established.

2.5 Converting from or to ELIQUIS

Switching from warfarin to ELIQUIS: Warfarin should be discontinued and ELIQUIS started when the international normalized ratio (INR) is below 2.0.

Switching from ELIQUIS to warfarin: ELIQUIS affects INR, so that initial INR measurements during the transition to warfarin may not be useful for determining the appropriate dose of warfarin. One approach is to discontinue ELIQUIS and begin both a parenteral anticoagulant and warfarin at the time the next dose of ELIQUIS would have been taken, discontinuing the parenteral anticoagulant when INR reaches an acceptable range.

Switching from ELIQUIS to anticoagulants other than warfarin (oral or parenteral): Discontinue ELIQUIS and begin taking the new anticoagulant other than warfarin at the usual time of the next dose of ELIQUIS.

Switching from anticoagulants other than warfarin (oral or parenteral) to ELIQUIS: Discontinue the anticoagulant other than warfarin and begin taking ELIQUIS at the usual time of the next dose of the anticoagulant other than warfarin.

2.6 Combined P-gp and Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors

For adult patients receiving ELIQUIS doses of 5 mg or 10 mg twice daily, reduce the dose by 50% when ELIQUIS is coadministered with drugs that are combined P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and strong cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

In patients already taking 2.5 mg twice daily, avoid coadministration of ELIQUIS with combined P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

### An open-label, 2 × 2 factorial, randomized controlled trial to evaluate the safety of apixaban vs. vitamin K antagonist and aspirin vs. placebo in patients with atrial fibrillation and acute coronary syndrome and / or percutaneous coronary intervention: rationale and design of the AUGUSTUS trial [^3e1661be]. American Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The optimal antithrombotic strategy for patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) who develop acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and/or the need for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is uncertain. The risk of bleeding is a major concern when oral anticoagulation is required to prevent stroke, and concomitant therapy with antiplatelet agents is required to minimize recurrent ischemic events.

Design

AUGUSTUS is an international, multicenter randomized trial with a 2 × 2 factorial design to compare apixaban with vitamin K antagonists and aspirin with placebo in patients with AF who develop ACS and/or undergo PCI and are receiving a P2Y12 inhibitor. Patients will be evaluated for eligibility during their ACS and/or PCI hospitalization. The primary outcome is the composite of major and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding defined by the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis. A key secondary outcome is the composite of all-cause death and all-cause hospitalization. Other secondary objectives are to evaluate ischemic outcomes including the composite of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, stent thrombosis, urgent revascularization, and all-cause hospitalization and each individual component. The aim is to enroll approximately 4,600 patients from around 500 sites in 33 countries.

Summary

AUGUSTUS will provide insight into the optimal oral antithrombotic therapy strategy for patients with AF and concomitant coronary artery disease. The unique 2 × 2 factorial design will delineate the bleeding effects of various anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapies and generate evidence to guide the selection of the optimal antithrombotic regimen for this challenging group of patients. It is the largest and only prospective randomized trial to investigate in a blinded fashion the risk and benefits of aspirin on top of a non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant and P2Y12 receptor inhibition.

### Pharmacology before, during and after percutaneous coronary intervention [^2a1873dc]. Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Summary

The cornerstone of pharmacology for patients undergoing PCI remains oral dual antiplatelet therapy. There is scant evidence for pretreatment before coronary anatomy is known. After PCI, advances in stent technology have reduced DAPT duration from 12 to 6 months in stable patients and 1 month in high bleeding risk. In high ischaemic, low bleeding risk patients, trial evidence has led to recommendations to extend antiplatelet or low dose anticoagulant (rivaroxaban) therapy beyond 12 months. Although randomised trial evidence of optimal dose is lacking, periprocedural use of anticoagulant therapy with UFH has extensive clinical experience and safety profile.

Advances in antithrombotic medications and carefully conducted clinical trials have improved outcomes in patients undergoing coronary intervention. Nevertheless, real world evidenceshowing recurrent ischaemic events in nearly a fifth of patients with ACS gives impetus to search for even more effective pharmacological agents.

Key messages

There is no mortality benefit of pretreatment with P2Y12 inhibitors in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).
The recommended duration of DAPT after PCI for stable angina is 6 months. Trial data with specific drug eluting stents (LEADERS-FREE, ONYX-ONE) show safety of 1-month duration in high bleeding risk.
For certain high ischaemic risk patients, trial (THEMIS-PCI, PEGASUS) data show ischaemic benefit with extended duration DAPT (ticagrelor plus aspirin).
Unfractionated heparin remains the anticoagulant of choice during PCI.
There is no role for routine use of intravenous glycoprotein inhibitors in PCI and their use is reserved only for bailout scenarios. Cangrelor may be considered in specific settings in P2Y12-naıve patients undergoing high-risk PCI.
Patients on warfarin for atrial fibrillation do not need to stop therapy before PCI. If on direct oral anticoagulants, this should be withheld 24 hours prior to procedure (or 48 hours if on dabigatran and creatine clearance < 50 mL/min).

There is no need for bridging with LMWH/UFH. The bold values deviate from the common stopping rule of ≥ 24-hour low risk; ≥ 48-hour high risk. Low risk is defined as a low frequency of bleeding and/or minor impact of a bleed. High risk is defined as a high frequency of bleeding and/or important clinical impact.

For patients on dabigatran with creatinine clearance (CrCl) of 30–50 mL/min we recommend that the last dose of the drug is 3–5 days before the procedure. Dabigatran therapy is contraindicated in patients with CrCl < 30 mL/min. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is a suitable alternative measurement of renal function, and the same numerical values apply for the purposes of these guidelines. If a patient on any DOAC is clinically deteriorating, his/her renal function should be checked before the procedure. These recommendations are supported by the findings of the PAUSE trial. Three thousand and seven patients on apixaban, dabigatran or rivaroxaban due for elective interventional procedures had a standardised interruption of therapy (Fig. 3): last dose of drug 2 days before low risk procedures (including diagnostic GI endoscopy) and 3 days before high risk procedures (including high risk therapeutic GI endoscopy; e.g. polypectomy). This was extended to last dose 5 days before a high risk procedure for dabigatran patients with CrCL < 50 mL/min. Resumption of therapy occurred at 1 day after low bleeding risk procedures and 2 to 3 days after high bleeding risk procedures. Low rates of major bleeding or arterial thromboembolism were observed. Low rates of venous thromboembolism were also observed although this was not a primary study outcome. We have maintained the recommendation to omit the morning dose of DOAC prior to low-risk endoscopic procedures, although the PAUSE trial demonstrates the safety of omitting the DOAC for 1 day before a low risk endoscopic procedure if desired

Different interruption and resumption timings of antithrombotic drugs under risk classifications

Peri-procedural management of antithrombotics ● Low-risk procedures: ○ Consensus across guidelines: Continue ASA (monotherapy or as part of DAPT) and warfarin. ○ DOACs (ASGE/JGES/APAGE) ● Generally recommend continuation. ● BSGE Exception: Suggests discontinuation, with timing adjusted by creatinine clearance. ● High-risk procedures: ○ ASA (all guidelines): Continued. ○ Non-ASA Antiplatelets (e.g. thienopyridines): Discontinued (detailed in). ○ Warfarin (all guidelines): Held preprocedure with LMWH/heparin bridging. Restarted post-procedure, resumption timing varies among the guidelines. ○ JGES-Specific Approach: Supports cilostazol as an alternative to ASA in select cases. ○ DOACs: ● ASGE/ESGE/APAGE: Discontinuation based on CrCl, no bridging recommended. ● JGES: Bridging advised in certain cases. ● Post-procedural resumption (all guidelines): Once hemostasis confirmed.
Bridging and international normalized ratio (INR) monitoring ● Warfarin bridging (all guidelines): ○ LMWH/heparin substitution before high-risk procedures. ○ Variability in bridging duration. ● INR assessment (all guidelines): ○ Preprocedure INR check mandatory to guide discontinuation. ○ Heparin stopped once INR therapeutic post-procedure.

The risk of endoscopy in patients on antithrombotics depends on the risks of procedural haemorrhage vs. thrombosis due to discontinuation of therapy. P2Y12 receptor antagonists (clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticagrelor): For low-risk endoscopic procedures we recommend continuing P2Y12 receptor antagonists as single or dual antiplatelet therapy (low quality evidence, strong recommendation); For high-risk endoscopic procedures in patients at low thrombotic risk, we recommend discontinuing P2Y12 receptor antagonists five days before the procedure (moderate quality evidence, strong recommendation). In patients on dual antiplatelet therapy, we suggest continuing aspirin (low quality evidence, weak recommendation). For high-risk endoscopic procedures in patients at high thrombotic risk, we recommend continuing aspirin and liaising with a cardiologist about the risk/benefit of discontinuation of P2Y12 receptor antagonists (high quality evidence, strong recommendation).

Fig. 14. Perioperative management of interventional techniques in patients on direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) describes risk-based interruption and resumption schedules: For high-risk procedures, DOAC interruption is 2 days prior, the day of, and one day after the procedure for a total cessation of 4 days, except that if creatinine clearance is less than 50 mL per minute for dabigatran (Pradaxa) it is stopped for 4 days with resuming on day 2 for a total cessation of 6 days; for intermediate or moderate risk, pre-procedural cessation totals 2 days (the day before and the day of) with resumption the next day; and for low-risk procedures there is no need of cessation. Post-procedure, DOAC can be resumed ~24 hours after low/moderate-bleed-risk procedures and 48–72 hours after high-bleed-risk procedures, and in selected patients at high risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE), low-dose enoxaparin 40 mg daily or dalteparin 5,000 IU daily can be given for the first 48–72 hours.

### Antithrombotic therapy to minimize Total events after ACS or PCI in Atrial fibrillation: insights from AUGUSTUS [^cf0d07f4]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Limited data exist on the optimal antithrombotic strategy to minimize total bleeding and ischemic events for patients with recent acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and atrial fibrillation (AF).

Objectives

The authors sought to identify the antithrombotic regimen that minimized total major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding events, ischemic events, and hospitalizations after ACS or PCI in AF.

Methods

We conducted a secondary analysis of AUGUSTUS (Open-label, 2×2 Factorial, Randomized, Controlled Clinical Trial to Evaluate the Safety of Apixaban vs Vitamin K Antagonist and Aspirin vs Placebo in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation and Acute Coronary Syndrome and/or Percutaneous Coronary Intervention), a 2×2 factorial, randomized trial evaluating apixaban vs a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) and aspirin vs placebo in patients with AF and ACS or PCI who were on P2Y 12 inhibitor therapy. We determined the incidence of total major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding events in patients receiving at least 1 dose of study therapy, total ischemic events, and total hospitalizations among patients randomized to each antithrombotic strategy.

Results

Over 6 months of follow-up, 573 of 4,568 (12.5%) patients experienced at least 1 bleeding event while on study drug; among them, 110 (19.2%) had multiple bleeding events. Compared with those with 1 bleeding event, patients with multiple bleeding events were more likely to be on a high-potency P2Y 12 inhibitor (prasugrel or ticagrelor vs clopidogrel). Of the 4,614 randomized participants, 219 (4.7%) had at least 1 ischemic event, among whom 75 (34.2%) had multiple ischemic events. At least 1 hospitalization occurred in 1,125 (24.4%) patients; among them, 384 (34.1%) had multiple hospitalizations. Apixaban, compared with VKA, significantly reduced the risk of total bleeding (rate ratio [RR]: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.55–0.80). Apixaban had similar rates of total ischemic events (RR: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.58–1.20) and total hospitalizations (RR: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.79–1.03) compared with VKA. Aspirin, compared with placebo, significantly increased the risk of total bleeding (RR: 2.14; 95% CI: 1.75–2.60). The rates of total ischemic events (RR: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.52–1.08) and total hospitalizations (RR: 1.11; 95% CI: 0.97–1.27) with aspirin and placebo were similar.

Conclusions

Among patients with AF and recent ACS or PCI, apixaban significantly reduced total bleeding risk compared with VKA. Aspirin doubled total bleeding risk compared with placebo without a significant change in total ischemic events. Based on this assessment of total events, our findings support the use of apixaban plus a low-potency P2Y 12 inhibitor (ie, clopidogrel) without aspirin as the standard therapy for this high-risk patient population.

7.3 Anticoagulants and Antiplatelet Agents

Coadministration of antiplatelet agents, fibrinolytics, heparin, aspirin, and chronic NSAID use increases the risk of bleeding.

APPRAISE-2, a placebo-controlled clinical trial of apixaban in high-risk, post-acute coronary syndrome patients treated with aspirin or the combination of aspirin and clopidogrel, was terminated early due to a higher rate of bleeding with apixaban compared to placebo. The rate of ISTH major bleeding was 2.8% per year with apixaban versus 0.6% per year with placebo in patients receiving single antiplatelet therapy and was 5.9% per year with apixaban versus 2.5% per year with placebo in those receiving dual antiplatelet therapy.

In ARISTOTLE, concomitant use of aspirin increased the bleeding risk on apixaban from 1.8% per year to 3.4% per year and concomitant use of aspirin and warfarin increased the bleeding risk from 2.7% per year to 4.6% per year. In this clinical trial, there was limited (2.3%) use of dual antiplatelet therapy with apixaban.

### The management of antithrombotic agents for patients undergoing GI endoscopy [^f2ba4db8]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2016). Medium credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants — periprocedural principles and laboratory assessment — Anti-Xa anticoagulants are best assessed by anti-Xa levels with drug-specific calibrators, whereas prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time are crude and may be minimally prolonged or normal; normal results rule out high circulating drug levels, there is no reliable serum assay to assess anticoagulant activity at this time, and interpretation of activated partial thromboplastin time requires caution due to a ceiling effect. In the periprocedural period, key considerations are time to maximum effect, half-life, and drug excretion; these agents have a short time to maximal effect (2–4 hours with rivaroxaban, 1–3 hours with apixaban), a half-life ranging from 8 to 15 hours, and renal excretion variability (rivaroxaban 66% and apixaban 25%). To minimize bleeding risk, these medications should be stopped for at least 2 half-lives before high-risk procedures and dosing adjusted for renal impairment.

### New antithrombotic agents – insights from clinical trials [^222888be]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2010). Medium credibility.

Antithrombotic agents are the cornerstones of therapy for thrombosis. The compositions of arterial and venous clots differ, rendering antiplatelet agents more effective for arterial thrombosis and anticoagulants more effective for venous disease. Despite taking acetylsalicylic acid, some patients with arterial disease experience thrombotic events. The addition of the ADP-receptor antagonist clopidogrel to therapeutic regimens containing acetylsalicylic acid improves outcomes in patients with acute coronary syndromes and in those undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. However, clopidogrel has several limitations, including variable absorption, drug-drug interactions and genetic factors that lead to reduced generation of the active metabolite, and a delayed onset and offset of action. A search for new ADP-receptor inhibitors has yielded drugs such as prasugrel, ticagrelor, and cangrelor. For patients with venous thrombosis, the coumarins have been the only available oral anticoagulants for more than 60 years. Despite their effectiveness in preventing and treating thromboembolism, coumarins have well-documented limitations, including drug-drug and drug-dietary interactions, a narrow therapeutic range, and inconvenience and cost of monitoring therapy. A search for new oral anticoagulants has yielded drugs such as dabigatran etexilate, rivaroxaban, and apixaban. In this article, we review these new antithrombotic agents and provide plausible explanations for the results of phase III randomized controlled trials of these drugs.

ISTH-based procedural bleed-risk stratification — procedures are categorized by 30-day major bleeding risk with representative examples and anticoagulation-interruption notes as follows: High-bleed-risk surgery/procedure (30-d risk of major bleed > 2%) includes any major operation (procedure duration > 45 min). Low-to-moderate-bleed-risk surgery/procedure (30-d risk of major bleed 0%-2%) includes GI endoscopy ± biopsy. Minimal-bleed-risk surgery/procedure (30-d risk of major bleed approximately 0%) includes pacemaker or cardioverter-defibrillator device implantation. Corresponding footnotes specify that for high-risk procedures minimal to no residual anticoagulant effect at time of procedure is expected (ie, four to five drug half-life interruptions pre-procedure), for low-to-moderate risk some residual anticoagulant effect is allowed (ie, two to three drug half-life interruptions pre-procedure), and for minimal-risk procedures the procedure can be safely done under full-dose anticoagulation (may consider holding DOAC dose day of procedure to avoid peak anticoagulant effects).

### To measure or not to measure direct oral anticoagulants before surgery or invasive procedures [^5dc837cb]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2016). Low credibility.

Patients on direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) may need interruption of treatment before surgery or invasive procedures. Owing to their favorable pharmacokinetics, DOAC could be interrupted for a fixed number of days before surgery or invasive procedures without laboratory testing. However, there are a number of issues that raise concerns about the safety of this strategy. In contrast, laboratory testing prior to surgery or invasive procedures would provide a direct assessment of the residual drug concentration and minimize the risk of bleeding. This forum is aimed at discussing the pros and cons of the two strategies and fostering discussion on this important issue. Overall, the laboratory strategy appears superior in terms of patient safety and should be considered in patients undergoing surgical or invasive procedures.

Perioperative management, kidney function and dialysis status

Figure 1.
Perioperative apixaban management in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease. Apixaban interruption and resumption intervals in hours, stratified according to procedural bleed risk. Intervals represent the time between last dose of apixaban before the procedure and the procedure itself, approximated to the nearest 12 hours. Apixaban was not resumed after the procedure for 1 patient undergoing a low-bleed-risk procedure and 4 patients undergoing high-bleed-risk procedures. The median interruption and resumption intervals for patients undergoing low/moderate-bleed-risk procedures was 84 hours (IQR 60–84) and 24 hours (IQR 24–48), respectively. The median interruption and resumption intervals for high-bleed-risk procedures was 84 hours (IQR 60–84) and 48 hours (IQR 24–72), respectively. Interruption intervals were not significantly different according to procedural bleed risk (P = 0.38), but patients who had undergone a high-bleed-risk procedure had significantly longer resumption intervals (P = 0.0037).

We present novel data on apixaban-treated patients with advanced CKD who underwent a planned invasive procedure. Interruptions were over twice as long for patients undergoing a low-bleed-risk procedure as compared with a recent perioperative DOAC management study (84 hours vs ∼39 hours, PAUSE study), and longer than guideline-recommended intervals. This could have been due to perceived delayed apixaban clearance in patients with kidney dysfunction. As expected, patients with CKD were at risk of bleeding complications on anticoagulation. On the other hand, we observed only 2 MB events felt to be directly related to surgery (3.3%), corresponding to a risk of MB similar to that observed among warfarin- or DOAC-treated patients when best practices are followed (∼ 1%-3%). We did not observe any postoperative ATE or VTE. The interruption intervals observed in this study equate to holding apixaban for 1 to 2 additional days before a procedure compared to guideline-recommended practice. Our results, although preliminary, are reassuring and seem to indicate that planned procedures can be undertaken in this patient population without undue risk of bleeding or thrombosis, provided anticoagulation is managed carefully.

Regarding perioperative care for perioperative bleeding, more specifically with respect to management of antithrombotic therapy, DOACs, ESAIC 2023 guidelines recommend to discontinue rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban 3 days before scheduled intermediate- and high-bleeding-risk procedures, pending a CrCl (Cockcroft-Gault formula) > 30 mL/min. Do not administer bridging.

### Perioperative factor Xa inhibitor discontinuation for patients undergoing procedures with minimal or low bleeding risk [^8f51547c]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Strengths and Limitations

A strength of the PERIXa study lies in its prospective enrollment of 1902 patients undergoing planned procedures with minimal to low bleeding risk, along with its inclusion of valuable edoxaban periprocedural data (n = 616 [32.4%]), which is limited in this research field. This study demonstrated a simplified DOAC interruption protocol before and after these interventions, making communicating with patients and health care professionals easier. This protocol resulted in a very low major bleeding event rate and no thromboembolic events at 30 days. A recent reviewproposes a slightly shorter, near noninterruption protocol than the PERIXa study. Their protocol suggests omitting twice daily DOACs only on the morning of the procedure and delaying once daily DOACs slightly beyond their usual ingestion time. However, this recommendation lacks support from evidence encompassing a wide range of large-scale procedures or 3 categories of procedures with minimal to low bleeding risk. Moreover, the absence of a defined discontinuation protocol can raise patient and health care professionals' concerns about postprocedure hemostasis difficulties, potentially leading to unnecessary and prolonged DOAC discontinuation.

Regarding perioperative care for periprocedural management of antithrombotic therapy, more specifically with respect to patients on DOACs, ASIPP 2024 guidelines recommend to interrupt DOACs (dabigatran, apixaban, rivaroxaban, and edoxaban) for 2 days for high-risk procedures and 1 day for intermediate-risk procedures. Adjust interruption to 2 days and 3–4 days for dabigatran with CrCl < 50 mL/minute. Consider continuing direct oral coagulants for low-risk procedures. Consuder continuing DOACs for intermediate-risk procedures in patients with normal renal function, based on clinical condition and importance.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Clinical scenario 3 — patient with prior venous thromboembolism (VTE) being considered for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) summarizes that the standard therapy for acute VTE is anticoagulation, and current guidelines give preference to a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) over a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) for non-cancer-associated VTE while low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) or a DOAC (rather than a VKA) are recommended for cancer-associated VTE. Venous thromboembolism provoked by a transient risk factor can generally be treated for 3 months, whereas unprovoked VTE may be treated indefinitely, and in patients on indefinite anticoagulation reduced-intensity options include rivaroxaban 10 mg daily and apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily. In patients with unprovoked VTE who stop anticoagulation after a minimum of 3 months, aspirin is an option for secondary prevention, although it is not as effective as anticoagulation, and in patients receiving PCI while on an OAC for VTE, triple therapy is associated with an increased risk of major bleeding.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation anticoagulant dosing — direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) and vitamin K antagonist (VKA) adjustments are detailed as follows: Apixaban 5 mg orally twice daily with dose reduction to 2.5 mg orally twice daily if at least 2 of the following are present: age ≥ 80 years, actual body weight ≤ 60 kg, or serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dL. Dabigatran 150 mg orally twice daily with dose reduction to 75 mg orally twice daily if CrCl is 15–30 mL/min; the FDA has not approved this dose for AF in the United States; in the European label, 110 mg twice daily is recommended for patients age ≥ 80 years and "For consideration" for those ages 75–80 years. Edoxaban 60 mg orally once daily is for CrCl 51–95 mL/min (not recommended if CrCl > 95 mL/min), with dose reduction to 30 mg orally once daily if CrCl is 15–50 mL/min. Rivaroxaban 20 mg orally once daily reduces to 15 mg orally once daily with the evening meal for patients with CrCl ≤ 50 mL/min. When used with antiplatelet therapy (APT), VKA targets INR 2.0–3.0.

WARNING: (A) PREMATURE DISCONTINUATION OF ELIQUIS INCREASES THE RISK OF THROMBOTIC EVENTS

(B) SPINAL/EPIDURAL HEMATOMA

(A) PREMATURE DISCONTINUATION OF ELIQUIS INCREASES THE RISK OF THROMBOTIC EVENTS

Premature discontinuation of any oral anticoagulant, including ELIQUIS, increases the risk of thrombotic events. If anticoagulation with ELIQUIS is discontinued for a reason other than pathological bleeding or completion of a course of therapy, consider coverage with another anticoagulant [see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), and Clinical Studies (14.1)].

(B) SPINAL/EPIDURAL HEMATOMA

Epidural or spinal hematomas may occur in patients treated with ELIQUIS who are receiving neuraxial anesthesia or undergoing spinal puncture. These hematomas may result in long-term or permanent paralysis. Consider these risks when scheduling patients for spinal procedures. Factors that can increase the risk of developing epidural or spinal hematomas in these patients include:

use of indwelling epidural catheters
concomitant use of other drugs that affect hemostasis, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), platelet inhibitors, other anticoagulants
a history of traumatic or repeated epidural or spinal punctures
a history of spinal deformity or spinal surgery
optimal timing between the administration of ELIQUIS and neuraxial procedures is not known

[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]

Monitor patients frequently for signs and symptoms of neurological impairment. If neurological compromise is noted, urgent treatment is necessary [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Consider the benefits and risks before neuraxial intervention in patients anticoagulated or to be anticoagulated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

### Percutaneous coronary intervention and antiplatelet therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation receiving apixaban or warfarin: insights from the ARISTOTLE trial [^7830b2a2]. American Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Background

We assessed antiplatelet therapy use and outcomes in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) during the ARISTOTLE trial.

Methods

Patients were categorized based on the occurrence of PCI during follow-up (median 1.8 years); PCI details and outcomes post-PCI are reported. Of the 18,201 trial participants, 316 (1.7%) underwent PCI (152 in apixaban group, 164 in warfarin group).

Results

At the time of PCI, 84% (267) were on study drug (either apixaban or warfarin). Of these, 19% did not stop study drug during PCI, 49% stopped and restarted < 5 days post-PCI, and 30% stopped and restarted > 5 days post-PCI. At 30 days post-PCI, 35% of patients received dual -antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), 23% received aspirin only, and 13% received a P2Y 12 inhibitor only; 29% received no antiplatelet therapy. Triple therapy (DAPT + oral anticoagulant [OAC]) was used in 21% of patients, 23% received OAC only, 15% received OAC plus aspirin, and 9% received OAC plus a P2Y 12 inhibitor; 32% received antiplatelet agents without OAC. Post-PCI, patients assigned to apixaban versus warfarin had numerically similar rates of major bleeding (5.93 vs 6.73 events/100 patient-years; P = 0.95) and stroke (2.74 vs 1.84 events/100 patient-years; P = 0.62).

Conclusions

PCI occurred infrequently during follow-up. Most patients on study drug at the time of PCI remained on study drug in the peri-PCI period; 19% continued the study drug without interruption. Antiplatelet therapy use post-PCI was variable, although most patients received DAPT. Additional data are needed to guide the use of antithrombotics in patients undergoing PCI.

Regarding perioperative care for atrial fibrillation, more specifically with respect to pre-procedural anticoagulation interruption, ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend to guide the timing of interruption of DOACs by the specific agent, renal function, and the bleeding risk of the procedure in patients with AF receiving DOACs scheduled to undergo an invasive procedure or surgery impossible to perform safely on uninterrupted anticoagulation.

### Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^f4d026b0]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

Perioperative interruption and resumption of DOACs — pre-operative DOAC level testing and circumstances for longer interruption are outlined: Measurement of DOAC levels before the surgery/procedure may be considered in patients who require an urgent (ie, within 24 hours) surgery, because routine coagulation tests such as the INR or aPTT may be insensitive; testing options include DOAC-calibrated anti-factor Xa levels for apixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban, and dilute thrombin time or ecarin clotting time for dabigatran, though questions remain as to their clinical utility. There may be selected patients in whom a longer duration of pre-operative DOAC interruption may be required due to the longer time required for drug clearance as 75% to 80% of dabigatran clearance is by the kidney and in those with severely impaired renal function (CrCl < 30 mL/min) or hepatic dysfunction or taking drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 or P-glycoprotein pathways.

Periprocedural non–vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) discontinuation — dabigatran and apixaban–edoxaban–rivaroxaban — before procedures is stratified by creatinine clearance (CrCl) and procedural bleeding risk as follows: For CrCl ≥ 80 mL/min, low risk discontinue dabigatran ≥ 24 h and apixaban–edoxaban–rivaroxaban ≥ 24 h; high risk discontinue dabigatran ≥ 48 h and apixaban–edoxaban–rivaroxaban ≥ 48 h. For CrCl 50–80 mL/min, low risk discontinue dabigatran ≥ 36 h and apixaban–edoxaban–rivaroxaban ≥ 24 h; high risk discontinue dabigatran ≥ 72 h and apixaban–edoxaban–rivaroxaban ≥ 48 h. For CrCl 30–50 mL/min, low risk discontinue dabigatran ≥ 48 h and apixaban–edoxaban–rivaroxaban ≥ 24 h; high risk discontinue dabigatran ≥ 96 h and apixaban–edoxaban–rivaroxaban ≥ 48 h. For CrCl 15–30 mL/min*, dabigatran has "No official indication"; use apixaban–edoxaban–rivaroxaban ≥ 36 h before low-risk and ≥ 48 h before high-risk procedures. For CrCl < 15 mL/min, dabigatran has "No official indication" and apixaban–edoxaban–rivaroxaban have "No official indication for use". When there is no important bleeding risk and/or adequate local hemostasis is possible, perform at trough level (i.e., ≥ 12 or 24 h after last intake). The bold values deviate from the common stopping rule of ≥ 24-hour low risk, ≥ 48-hour high risk, and there is no need for bridging with LMWH/UFH (low-molecular-weight heparin/unfractionated heparin).

Procedural Techniques

Patient Preparation

The ideal antiplatelet regimen preceding PFO closure has not been studied. Most operators will pretreat patients with aspirin (81–325 mg) and/or clopidogrel (75 mg). In the CLOSE and RESPECT clinical trials, all patients received aspirin and clopidogrel on the day of the procedure, whereas only clopidogrel was administered in the REDUCE trial. 25, 26, 27 Duration of dual antiplatelet therapy post PFO closure is discussed under Postprocedure Care below. Patients on chronic antithrombotic therapy for other indications who are high risk for thromboembolic events may be bridged at the physician's discretion. Other patients at lower risk should have their medication held before the procedure. Although data on antimicrobial prophylaxis for cardiac device implantation are scarce, administration of prophylactic antibiotic therapy within 60 minutes of the procedure start time using a first‐generation cephalosporin (such as cefazolin 2 g IV) is recommended. 53

Access Site

The femoral vein, preferably the right femoral vein, remains the most common approach for PFO closure. Location of the PFO within the IAS is well suited to the femoral approach, allowing for easier access of wires, catheters, and delivery sheaths. The presence of a filter device in the IVC does not usually preclude a femoral approach. Most IVC filters can easily be traversed with wires and catheters provided care is used to avoid dislodgement or entrapment within the filter device. 54 However, in rare cases, the presence of an IVC occlusion may preclude a femoral venous approach. In these situations, alternative access sites, such as the internal jugular vein, 55 axillary vein, 56 and hepatic vein, 57 have been successfully used for device delivery.

If an Amplatzer PFO occluder is used, an 8‐ or 9‐French femoral vein introducer sheath is placed. An 11‐French sheath is used if a Gore Cardioform Septal Occluder is chosen. If ICE is used for imaging, a second 8‐French sheath is placed either on the contralateral side or below the first introducer sheath on the ipsilateral side. Vascular injury with the rigid ICE catheter can be avoided by using a 23‐cm introducer sheath to traverse the bifurcation of the IVC. It is prudent to use fluoroscopic guidance when introducing and manipulating the ICE catheter. 58 PFO procedures require anticoagulation, and intravenous unfractionated heparin is generally given after vascular access is achieved at a dose of 70 to 100 IU/kg to maintain an activated clotting time of more than 250 seconds.

### Towards zero thromboembolic events after bariatric metabolic surgery [^79d8282e]. Obesity Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Preoperative VTE Prophylaxis

Twelve hours prior to BMS, the patient received 40 mg of enoxaparin subcutaneously, and this was continued for 12 h postsurgery.

Oral Anticoagulant Presurgery

In case the patients had received oral anticoagulant before surgery, a rapid-acting short half-life anticoagulant (enoxaparin) was also administered to minimize the risk of bleeding. As the half-life of the anticoagulant effects of warfarin is 36–42 h, it would take at least 5 days for the anticoagulant effect of warfarin not to be active any longer after discontinuation.

Additionally, enoxaparin should be started 36–48 h after the last warfarin dose.

To complete bridging, a therapeutic dose of 60 or 80 mg twice daily was required, with the last dose administered 12 h before surgery. Prophylactic doses were used when the risk of discontinuation of an anticoagulant was low in the context of cardioembolic sequelae.

Regimen on Direct Oral Anticoagulants (DOACs)

DOACs (e.g. apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban) possess a rapid onset of action of approximately 1–3 h to peak concentration and a shorter half-life than warfarin.

In line with the general prescription, the DOAC was stopped 48 h before the BMS. In patients at risk of atrial fibrillation, those with a history of DVT, and those with prosthetic heart valves, therapeutic cover with a dose of enoxaparin 40 mg was initiated. The last dose was administered 12 h before BMS.

Other drugs

Aspirin was not stopped before BMS, and clopidogrel was stopped 5 days before surgery and bridged with a prophylactic dose of enoxaparin.

### Perioperative management of antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy in patients undergoing interventional techniques: 2024 updated guidelines from the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) [^07b519b1]. Pain Physician (2024). High credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) — dabigatran dosing and pharmacology: Direct oral anticoagulants include factor IIa, dabigatran (Pradaxa); and factor Xa, apixaban (Eliquis), rivaroxaban (Xarelto), and Edoxaban (Savaysa, Lixiana) inhibitors. After an oral dose of dabigatran, maximal effects are observed within 2 to 4 hours and the plasma half-life is 13 hours on average. Dosing depends on renal function, with patients with a creatinine clearance of greater than 30mL/minute receiving 150 mg orally twice a day and those with a creatinine clearance lower than 30mL/minute receiving 75 mg given twice daily as recommended. Because dabigatran functions via factor inhibition and not clotting factor depletion, the administration of clotting factors in an effort to reverse the effects of the drug is less effective, and the drug is primarily renally excreted with time to excretion varying depending on renal sufficiency.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Table 4 — anticoagulation dosing for venous thromboembolism (VTE) details direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) and low–molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) regimens with renal considerations. Apixaban initial treatment is 10 mg orally twice daily for the first 7 days followed by 5 mg orally twice daily, and after ≥ 6 months of initial therapy either 5 mg orally twice daily or 2.5 mg orally twice daily can be considered. Rivaroxaban initial treatment is 15 mg orally twice daily with food for the first 21 days followed by 20 mg orally once daily with food, and after ≥ 6 months either 20 mg orally daily with food or 10 mg orally daily with or without food can be considered; avoid use in patients with a CrCl of < 15 mL/min. Dabigatran is dosed 150 mg orally twice daily when preceded by 5–10 days of parenteral anticoagulation, and patients with severe renal impairment (a CrCl of ≤ 30 mL/min) and those receiving hemodialysis were not enrolled, with no dosing recommendations in that population. Edoxaban is 60 mg orally once daily when preceded by at least 5–10 days of parenteral anticoagulation, with dose reduction to 30 mg once daily for patients with a CrCl 15–50 mL/min or body weight ≤ 60 kg. In cancer-associated VTE, dalteparin is 200 units/kg subcutaneously once daily for 1 month then 150 IU/kg once daily for months 2–6; enoxaparin is 1 mg/kg twice daily or 1.5 mg/kg once daily subcutaneously, with dose reduction to 1 mg/kg subcutaneously once daily for patients with a CrCl of < 30 mL/min.

### Surgeon's guide to anticoagulant and antiplatelet medications part two: antiplatelet agents and perioperative management of long-term anticoagulation [^0b040e10]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2016). Low credibility.

After the risks of both thromboembolism and hemorrhage have been weighed against each other, the current anticoagulation status of the patient must be evaluated. It is possible to measure direct levels of dabigatran and rivaroxaban, with different recommendations for procedural timing according to plasma concentration. Patients found to have levels < 30 ng/mL are generally considered safe for surgery. Those with 30–200 ng/mL are advised to delay procedures at least 12 hours if possible, followed by a recheck of plasma levels. Patients with levels between 200 and 400ng/mL should delay interventions at least 24 hours, and those with levels > 400 ng/mL are considered at major risk of uncontrollable hemorrhage and should consider hemodialysis or other removal methods. However, in order to measure plasma concentrations, this requires access to mass spectrometry, which is not always readily available.

In the absence of direct level measurements, estimates can be obtained with other qualitative estimates or indirect quantitative measurements. Warfarin can be quantitatively estimated with INR measurement. Direct thrombin inhibitors such as dabigatran can be qualitatively estimated using activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin (PT), or thrombin time or quantitatively measured with dilute thrombin time, ecarin chromogenic assay, or ecarin clotting time. Factor Xa inhibitors such as rivaroxaban or apixaban can be estimated via PT or measured with chromogenic antifactor Xa. Antiplatelet agents are gauged qualitatively with optical aggregometry or quantitated with flow cytometry, platelet function assay, or thromboelastography. While these tests can give an estimate of the patient's current status, they are far from exact and can only serve as an indicator of anticipated complications in the event of an emergency, although they may be useful in attempting to reduce risks in semiurgent or elective cases.

### American College of Gastroenterology-Canadian association of gastroenterology clinical practice guideline: management of anticoagulants and antiplatelets during acute gastrointestinal bleeding and the periendoscopic period [^7b8c7ba1]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions.

From the limited available data, for patients on DOACs undergoing elective, planned endoscopic GI procedures, we suggest temporary interruption of the DOACs is preferred over continued DOAC administration. The duration of temporary DOAC interruption before endoscopic procedures associated with favorable outcomes is between 1 and 2 days, excluding the day of the procedure, which permits the shortest preprocedural duration of DOAC interruption while balancing bleeding and thromboembolism risk.

As the window of temporary interruption evaluated in this clinical question was 1–5 days before endoscopy, the panel discussed if withholding DOACs for 1–5 days could trigger a prothrombotic state that might result in thrombosis with any subsequent postendoscopic delays in DOAC resumption. It was argued that the prothrombotic risks seem to be more related to the periprocedural milieu (e.g. nature of the intervention such as vascular surgery vs nonvascular surgery and patient characteristics) than the brief interruption of DOACs. Furthermore, given the rapid action of onset and half-life of DOACs, the thrombotic risk of interruption is anticipated to be lower than with interruption of warfarin.

Antiplatelet interruption vs continuation.

14A. For patients on dual antiplatelet therapy for secondary cardiovascular prevention who are undergoing elective endoscopic GI procedures, we suggest temporary interruption of the P2Y 12 inhibitor while continuing ASA (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence).

SCAI expert consensus — medications (antiplatelet agents) — states that loading before the procedure with a P2Y12 inhibitor is reasonable, although there is no evidence that pre-loading decreases ischemic complications compared to loading at the time of PCI or at its conclusion, and delaying P2Y12 loading until anatomy is known may prevent delays if that anatomy demonstrates a need for CABG; patient medications should be reviewed with attention to those that might impact the conduct or outcome of the procedure.

### American College of Gastroenterology-Canadian association of gastroenterology clinical practice guideline: management of anticoagulants and antiplatelets during acute gastrointestinal bleeding and the periendoscopic period [^a40f2edc]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

We conducted systematic reviews of predefined clinical questions and used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations approach to develop recommendations for the periendoscopic management of anticoagulant and antiplatelet drugs during acute gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and the elective endoscopic setting. The following recommendations target patients presenting with acute GI bleeding: For patients on warfarin, we suggest against giving fresh frozen plasma or vitamin K; if needed, we suggest prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) compared with fresh frozen plasma administration; for patients on direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), we suggest against PCC administration; if on dabigatran, we suggest against the administration of idarucizumab, and if on rivaroxaban or apixaban, we suggest against andexanet alfa administration; for patients on antiplatelet agents, we suggest against platelet transfusions; and for patients on cardiac acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) for secondary prevention, we suggest against holding it, but if the ASA has been interrupted, we suggest resumption on the day hemostasis is endoscopically confirmed. The following recommendations target patients in the elective (planned) endoscopy setting: For patients on warfarin, we suggest continuation as opposed to temporary interruption (1–7 days), but if it is held for procedures with high risk of GI bleeding, we suggest against bridging anticoagulation unless the patient has a mechanical heart valve; for patients on DOACs, we suggest temporarily interrupting rather than continuing these; for patients on dual antiplatelet therapy for secondary prevention, we suggest temporary interruption of the P2Y12 receptor inhibitor while continuing ASA; and if on cardiac ASA monotherapy for secondary prevention, we suggest against its interruption. Evidence was insufficient in the following settings to permit recommendations. With acute GI bleeding in patients on warfarin, we could not recommend for or against PCC administration when compared with placebo. In the elective periprocedural endoscopy setting, we could not recommend for or against temporary interruption of the P2Y12 receptor inhibitor for patients on a single P2Y12 inhibiting agent. We were also unable to make a recommendation regarding same-day resumption of the drug vs 1–7 days after the procedure among patients prescribed anticoagulants (warfarin or DOACs) or P2Y12 receptor inhibitor drugs because of insufficient evidence.

Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2019). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) — related bleeding is attributed to an abnormal platelet–endothelial interaction that interferes with VWF function and to anemia affecting platelet activation; patients with CKD have increased bleeding at baseline, during endovascular procedures, and when receiving antiplatelet agents or anticoagulation, with risks at all CKD stages but most pronounced in uremia; there are no well-validated tests to assess periprocedural bleeding risk and platelet function tests are not routinely available; medication choices are influenced by renal function for many anticoagulants including LMWH, fondaparinux, and DOAC, and "hold" times before elective procedures will be relatively prolonged in the presence of CKD.

### Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^d70a4ab3]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

American College of Chest Physicians guideline — timing of DOAC resumption after interruption: In patients who had DOAC interruption for an elective surgery/procedure, we suggest resuming DOACs > 24 hours after a surgery/procedure over resuming DOACs within 24 hours (Conditional Recommendation, Very Low Certainty of Evidence). Implementation notes specify that resumption depends on procedural bleed risk, with at least 24 hours after low-to-moderate-bleed-risk and 48–72 hours after high-bleed-risk, and that DOACs have a rapid onset with a peak effect occurring 1 to 3 hours after intake requiring cautious post-operative administration. Supporting evidence includes a randomized trial of 662 patients undergoing pacemaker/ICD implantation showing no significant difference in pocket hematomas with interruption versus continuation (OR = 1.02; 95% CI: 0.36–2.87), and the PAUSE protocol standardizing resumption at approximately 24 hours for low-to-moderate-bleed-risk and 48 to 72 hours for high-bleed-risk surgery/procedure.

### Executive summary: perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^448d4f09]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

Regarding perioperative care for perioperative bleeding, more specifically with respect to management of antithrombotic therapy, P2Y12 inhibitors, ACCP 2022 guidelines recommend to consider discontinuing clopidogrel 5 days before surgery in patients receiving clopidogrel and undergoing elective noncardiac surgery.

### Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^4ca52567]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

Perioperative antithrombotic management — scope and patient groups includes interruption and resumption of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) before and after an elective surgery/procedure, perioperative management of antiplatelet therapy around non-cardiac surgery, coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, and in patients with cardiac stents, and management of vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), DOACs, and antiplatelet drugs around minor procedures. For patients receiving oral anticoagulant therapy, recommendations pertain to those with chronic atrial fibrillation, a mechanical prosthetic heart valve, or venous thromboembolism (VTE), and for patients receiving antiplatelet therapy, recommendations pertain mainly to those who have coronary artery disease and require non-cardiac surgery, CABG surgery, or percutaneous coronary interventions and, to a lesser extent, to patients receiving antiplatelet therapy for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease who need non-cardiac surgery.

When to stop and resume DOACS?

No studies are available to guide the optimal time for discontinuation or resumption of DOACs for endoscopic procedures. Currently available guidelines are conflicting. The ASGE Guidelines recommend continuation of DOACs for low-risk procedures and discontinuing anticoagulation according to the pharmacokinetic properties of individual DOACs for high-risk procedures. The BSG-ESGE Guidelines suggest omitting the morning dose of DOACs on the day of low-risk procedures and recommend the last dose of DOACs be taken at least 48 hours before high-risk procedures. Given the minimal bleeding risk associated with diagnostic endoscopy and mucosal biopsy, our Task Force does not suggest omitting DOACs before low-risk procedures. For high-risk procedures, our recommendation depends on the choice of DOAC (dabigatran vs other DOACs) and the patient's creatinine clearance (table 3). For patients on dabigatran, the last dose should be taken 48 hours before the procedure if the renal function is normal (CrCl > 80 mL/min). Lengthening the period of discontinuation is required in patients with renal impairment because 80% of dabigatran metabolite is excreted by the kidneys (table 3). For patients on other DOACs (apixaban, rivaroxaban and edoxaban), we recommend the last dose should be taken 48 hours before the procedure provided that CrCl is > 15 mL/min. Since DOACs have short half-lives and rapid onset of action, heparin bridging is not recommended. We recommend early resumption of DOACs after haemostasis has been achieved.
