## Question

Which laboratory tests should be ordered for idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH)?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which laboratory tests to order for suspected idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), distinguishing universal tests from selective tests and integrating CSF analysis, atypical features, and follow-up strategy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the diagnostic framework and the principle that IIH is a diagnosis of exclusion anchored in the 2018 ABN/BASH/RCOphth/SBNS consensus guidelines. Then, I should verify which labs are universal for all patients versus those reserved for atypical presentations. Next, I will review how CSF analysis fits within "laboratory" testing and the nuances of opening pressure interpretation. After that, I should delineate atypical phenotypes that trigger targeted testing for secondary causes. Finally, I will synthesize a practical algorithm and highlight key caveats, including the quality of evidence and follow-up considerations.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic framework: IIH remains a diagnosis of exclusion requiring normal neuroimaging aside from signs of raised ICP and confirmation via lumbar puncture with appropriate CSF analysis; the 2018 consensus statements are the foundational source guiding which tests are "universal" versus "selective" based on phenotype and suspicion of secondary causes [^116L1UFf] [^111EGcds].

> I should confirm the universal baseline blood test. The guidelines specify that a complete blood count should be obtained in all patients to exclude anemia as a reversible secondary cause of raised ICP; this is mandatory baseline laboratory testing and should not be omitted [^116L1UFf] [^111jc8V5].

> Wait, let me verify how CSF fits into "laboratory testing". Although not a blood test, CSF analysis is an essential laboratory component in IIH: measure opening pressure in lateral decubitus with legs extended and use an adult diagnostic threshold of greater than 25 cm CSF, and ensure CSF composition is normal at minimum with protein, glucose, and cell count to exclude infectious or inflammatory etiologies [^1161Cbk5] [^114Axqaw] [^1129tU6W].

> I need to check when to add CSF microbiology. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: routine microbiology is not indicated if composition is otherwise normal and there is no concern for infection; reserve microbiological testing for clinical suspicion, including in shunted patients who present with headache exacerbations where infection is on the differential [^112Gxtaz] [^1129tU6W].

> Next, I should review who is "atypical", because that determines when additional blood tests are warranted. Atypical features include normal BMI, older age (for adults, typically over 50), male sex, children under 10, an unusual course, or presentations without papilledema (IIHWOP); in these scenarios, guidelines advise selective testing for secondary causes rather than a broad panel in all-comers [^112owcZi] [^111NekKk] [^113w5qTF] [^113acFqn].

> I will now examine targeted testing for endocrine and metabolic associations in atypical cases. There is a strong association between IIH and metabolic dysfunction (insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes), and a notable over-representation of PCOS in women with IIH; thus, in appropriate clinical contexts, consider fasting glucose or HbA1c, and an androgen/PCOS-directed panel in reproductive-age women. Hmm, wait a minute — thyroid dysfunction is commonly screened in endocrine workups, but I should confirm guideline support; it is not explicitly mandated in the cited IIH guidelines, so TSH and free T4 should be considered case-by-case rather than as universal testing in typical IIH, correcting my earlier inclination to imply it as standard for all patients [^1166gubd].

> Let me consider medication and substance causes. A careful history for tetracyclines, retinoids or hypervitaminosis A, growth hormone, and other implicated agents is essential; if exposure suggests hypervitaminosis A, serum vitamin A levels can help confirm a secondary cause rather than IIH, and testing should be directed by the exposure history rather than obtained indiscriminately [^1166gubd] [^116L1UFf].

> I should confirm infectious mimics. While not routine, syphilis can clinically mimic IIH; in atypical or refractory presentations, non-treponemal/treponemal testing is reasonable, recognizing this is supported by low-level evidence but aligns with the principle of excluding secondary causes when the phenotype is not typical [^116NULca] [^114iox9c].

> I need to ensure systemic comorbidities are not missed. Chronic kidney disease is a documented association with secondary intracranial hypertension, so a basic metabolic panel with renal function is sensible in atypical patients; hepatic panels may be considered selectively, but the strongest available signal here is for renal disease. But wait, what if pregnancy status affects management? In women of childbearing potential, a pregnancy test is prudent before initiating potentially teratogenic therapy and because pregnancy status influences management planning and counseling, even though the primary guideline statements emphasize counseling rather than a mandated test list, which still supports checking when relevant to imminent treatment decisions [^114iox9c] [^112uyEkJ].

> Hold on, I should now synthesize a practical algorithm. For typical IIH (obese women of childbearing age with a compatible presentation), obtain CBC to exclude anemia, perform LP with proper opening pressure technique, and confirm normal CSF composition; defer additional blood tests unless clinical features raise suspicion. For atypical phenotypes or unusual courses, add targeted labs guided by history and risk: endocrine/metabolic testing such as fasting glucose or HbA1c and PCOS-directed androgens in appropriate women, selective thyroid tests if clinically indicated, syphilis serology where risk exists, vitamin A level if exposure suspected, and renal function testing to evaluate for CKD-related secondary intracranial hypertension. For follow-up, there is no requirement for routine laboratory monitoring in stable IIH; surveillance should center on visual function and optic nerve head documentation with photography or OCT, repeating labs only as clinically indicated by changes or treatments [^116L1UFf] [^1129tU6W] [^11193HzH] [^113W6zX5].

> Let me double-check the key caveats. The timing matters: these laboratory considerations are focused on the initial diagnostic exclusion of secondary causes rather than on chronic monitoring. Opening pressure is central but must not be interpreted in isolation; if the value conflicts with the clinical picture, repeat LP or ICP monitoring may be needed. Finally, to avoid over-testing and improve cost-effectiveness, additional blood work should be reserved for atypical cases, acknowledging that these recommendations are consensus-based due to limited high-quality trials [^111jc8V5] [^112JVin2] [^112owcZi] [^114v4iE2].

> Wait, one more nuance I should verify: describing opening pressure as the "most critical laboratory test" is imprecise since it is a procedural measurement rather than a conventional lab assay; however, including CSF opening pressure and composition within a laboratory testing framework is standard in IIH workups because normal CSF constituents and elevated OP are diagnostic cornerstones. I will keep the emphasis but be precise about its procedural nature and interpret it alongside clinical findings and imaging [^1161Cbk5] [^114Axqaw] [^111EGcds].

> Final synthesis: For typical IIH, order a CBC in all patients and perform LP with proper technique to document opening pressure and confirm normal CSF composition; add tests only if clinical cues suggest otherwise. For atypical patients or atypical courses, target additional labs to plausible secondary causes, including metabolic/endocrine assessment (glucose/HbA1c, PCOS-directed androgens as appropriate), syphilis serology when risk exists, vitamin A level if exposure suggests hypervitaminosis A, and renal function evaluation. Reserve CSF microbiology for suspected infection. Focus follow-up on ophthalmic monitoring rather than routine labs, and always integrate OP values with the overall clinical context rather than interpreting them in isolation [^116L1UFf] [^1129tU6W] [^112Gxtaz] [^112owcZi] [^112JVin2].

For IIH, order a **CBC to exclude anemia** and a **basic metabolic panel** to assess electrolytes and renal function [^114iox9c]. After normal imaging [^111EGcds], perform a **lumbar puncture** to measure opening pressure and confirm normal CSF; analyze CSF protein, glucose, and cell count [^114Jy57p] [^1129tU6W]. In atypical cases, add thyroid function tests, endocrine panels, and infectious serologies to exclude secondary causes [^112owcZi] [^116NULca]. No **specific biomarkers** exist for IIH; laboratory testing is used to exclude other causes and confirm normal CSF composition [^114Jy57p].

---

## Essential laboratory tests for IIH

### Complete blood count (CBC)

The **purpose** is to exclude anemia, a potential secondary cause of elevated intracranial pressure [^116L1UFf]. The **clinical relevance** is that anemia can mimic or exacerbate IIH symptoms; identifying and treating it is essential [^114iox9c].

---

### Basic metabolic panel (BMP)

The **purpose** is to assess electrolytes, renal function, and glucose [^114iox9c]. The **clinical relevance** is that electrolyte imbalances or renal dysfunction can contribute to secondary intracranial hypertension; normal results support an idiopathic diagnosis.

---

### Lumbar puncture (LP) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis

- **Purpose**: Measure opening pressure and analyze CSF composition [^1161Cbk5].

- **Clinical relevance**: Elevated opening pressure (> 25 cm H₂O in adults) with normal CSF composition is a hallmark of IIH [^114Axqaw].

- **CSF analysis**: Protein, glucose, and cell count must be normal to confirm IIH [^1129tU6W].

---

## Additional laboratory tests for atypical or secondary cases

In atypical presentations or when secondary causes are suspected, **additional laboratory testing** is recommended [^112owcZi]:

| **Test** | **Purpose** | **Clinical relevance** |
|-|-|-|
| Thyroid function tests (TSH, free T4) | Assess thyroid dysfunction | Hypo- or hyperthyroidism can cause secondary intracranial hypertension [^114iox9c] |
| Endocrine panel (cortisol, prolactin, androgens) | Evaluate hormonal imbalances | Hormonal disorders (e.g. Cushing's, PCOS) can mimic IIH |
| Infectious serologies (syphilis, Lyme disease, HIV) | Exclude infectious causes | Infections can cause secondary intracranial hypertension [^116NULca] |
| Autoimmune panel (ANA, ANCA) | Screen for autoimmune diseases | Autoimmune conditions can cause secondary intracranial hypertension [^114iox9c] |

---

## Laboratory tests not routinely recommended

Certain laboratory tests are **not routinely recommended** unless specific clinical indications are present:

- **Coagulation profile**: Only if venous sinus thrombosis is suspected.

- **Vitamin A levels**: Only if hypervitaminosis A is suspected [^1166gubd].

- **Heavy metal screening**: Only if exposure is suspected.

---

## Laboratory tests for monitoring disease progression

Laboratory tests are **not typically used** to monitor IIH progression. Instead, monitoring focuses on:

- **Visual acuity and visual fields**: Regular ophthalmologic assessments [^11193HzH].

- **Headache frequency and severity**: Clinical evaluation and patient-reported outcomes [^113W6zX5].

- **Body mass index (BMI)**: Regular monitoring and weight management counseling [^1135oKZH].

---

## Emerging biomarkers and novel laboratory tests

Currently, **no specific biomarkers** or novel laboratory tests have been validated for routine clinical use in IIH. Research is ongoing to identify potential biomarkers, but none are recommended for clinical practice [^1119MgUf] [^111xW6fL].

---

## Summary of recommended laboratory tests for IIH

| **Test** | **Purpose** | **Clinical relevance** |
|-|-|-|
| CBC | Exclude anemia | Essential for all patients [^116L1UFf] |
| BMP | Assess electrolytes, renal function, glucose | Essential for all patients [^114iox9c] |
| LP and CSF analysis | Measure opening pressure and analyze CSF composition | Essential for all patients [^114Jy57p] [^1129tU6W] |
| Thyroid function tests | Assess thyroid dysfunction | Recommended for atypical cases [^114iox9c] |
| Endocrine panel | Evaluate hormonal imbalances | Recommended for atypical cases [^1119MgUf] |
| Infectious serologies | Exclude infectious causes | Recommended for atypical cases [^116NULca] |
| Autoimmune panel | Screen for autoimmune diseases | Recommended for atypical cases [^114iox9c] |

---

Laboratory tests for IIH are primarily used to exclude secondary causes and confirm normal CSF composition [^114iox9c]. Essential tests include **CBC, BMP, and LP with CSF analysis** [^114Jy57p] [^1129tU6W]. Additional tests may be required for atypical cases, but no specific biomarkers are available for routine clinical use [^1119MgUf].

### Emerging themes in idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^111xW6fL]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a rare disorder characterized by raised intracranial pressure. The underlying pathophysiology is mostly unknown, and effective treatment is an unmet clinical need in this disease. This review evaluates key emerging themes regarding disease characteristics, mechanisms contributing to raised intracranial pressure, and advances in potential therapeutic targets.

- **Findings**: IIH is becoming more common, with the incidence rising in parallel with the global obesity epidemic. Medical management remains centered around weight management, which is challenging. Metabolic investigations of patients have identified specific androgen profiles in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), suggesting an endocrine dysfunction impacting CSF secretion in IIH. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1) have been found to play a role in CSF dynamics in IIH and have formed the basis of the first clinical trials investigating new treatments.

- **Conclusions**: Identification of novel molecular targets thought to underlie IIH pathology is now being translated to clinical trials.

### Idiopathic intracranial hypertension in childhood: pitfalls in diagnosis [^113w5qTF]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is prone to misdiagnosis. Our aim was to identify the reasons for this in children in our region referred for suspected IIH.

- **Method**: We reviewed the records of all children referred with symptoms and/or signs consistent with raised intracranial pressure (ICP) and normal magnetic resonance imaging of the brain to our tertiary neurology unit over 4 years. IIH was confirmed after expert ophthalmology, including ultrasound/tomography and advanced cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure studies.

- **Results**: Of 15 children (six males, nine females; median age 12 years, range 3–15 years), six (five females, one male) were confirmed to have IIH. All weighed above the 91st centile and were over 10 years old. Four of the six had raised ICP secondary to other causes. Four had been misdiagnosed locally with papilloedema, three had drusen, and one had 'crowded discs'. Two had raised CSF pressures on standard lumbar puncture, but 20-minute steady state and infusion studies were normal, with symptoms settling after therapy was withdrawn.

- **Interpretation**: Misdiagnosis of IIH was frequent but could be reduced by (1) expert ophthalmological fundoscopy, orbital ultrasound, and optical coherence tomography; (2) expert neuroradiology; and (3) assessment of steady state CSF pressure rather than standard opening pressure in centimetres of water.

Q17 How should an acute exacerbation of headache be investigated in those who are already shunted?

For all shunted patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) presenting with an acute exacerbation of headaches, funduscopy is mandatory to establish if papilloedema exists. If visual function, including formal visual fields, is documented to be worsening, then surgical intervention may be required. For those with atrophic optic nerves, further care should be taken to establish whether the headache is secondary to raised intracranial pressure.

In those where there is suspicion of infection that may be worsening the headache, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) should be obtained for microbiological evaluation and any underlying resultant infection appropriately treated. A diagnostic lumbar puncture should not be routinely performed in the absence of papilloedema unless there is a suspicion of infection.

In those with papilloedema, some may choose to perform a diagnostic lumbar puncture. This may be helpful to establish intracranial pressure (ICP) level and may have implications for management choices. CT imaging and shunt X-ray series should not routinely be considered for those without evidence of papilloedema, as these investigations do not alter management. In some cases, ICP monitoring may be useful.

Q18 How should an acute exacerbation of headache be treated in those who are already shunted? (figure 4)

For patients without papilloedema or imminent risk to vision, shunt revision is not recommended.

To characterize the clinical features of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) in patients over 50 years of age compared to the typical IIH population and existing data for this older cohort, a retrospective clinical cohort study was conducted.

Medical records of 65 patients over 50 years of age, diagnosed with IIH based on the Modified Dandy Criteria from four academic centers, were reviewed. Each center provided randomly selected controls from IIH patients. Patients over 50 years of age were less often female, had lower cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) opening pressure, fewer headaches, a higher chance of incidentally identified papilledema, and a body mass index similar to that of younger IIH patients. Notably, older IIH onset was not associated with worse visual outcomes.

### Diagnosis and treatment of idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^113acFqn]. Cephalalgia (2021). Low credibility.

Papilledema is encountered in almost all patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) and is therefore a key feature in assessing patients suspected of having this condition. A large retrospective study of 353 patients with IIH identified only 20 patients who presented without papilledema (5.7%). It is important for clinicians to be aware that while mostly bilateral, papilledema may be asymmetrical. Indeed, the IIHTT found that 7% of patients had a difference of 2 Frisen grades or more in the papilledema grading between the two eyes.

When assessing an optic nerve for the likelihood of papilledema, the presence of spontaneous venous pulsations (SVP) has traditionally been considered to exclude the possibility of raised intracranial pressure (ICP). However, a study by Wong et al. reports that SVP were visible in 12 of 20 IIH patients with mild papilledema, five of whom had an opening pressure on lumbar puncture of > 30 cmH₂O. Although this represents a subgroup analysis and is limited by the small sample size, this study serves as a reminder that the presence of SVP does not invariably rule out raised ICP. If untreated, papilledema can result in optic atrophy in patients with IIH, although the associated visual deficits mean the diagnosis is often easy to make at this late stage.

### Clinical characterization of idiopathic intracranial hypertension at the Detroit Medical Center [^1147xHqX]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2004). Low credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), also known as pseudotumor cerebri (PTC), is a condition characterized by increased intracranial pressure without clinical, laboratory, or radiologic evidence of an intracranial space-occupying lesion, meningeal inflammation, or venous outflow obstruction. Previous population-based studies evaluated the presenting clinical features of IIH in North-Eastern Libya, Iowa, Louisiana, Minnesota, Northern Ireland, Israel, and Western Turkey. However, we report the demographic patterns of a metropolitan North American city.

- **Methods**: We performed a retrospective study of all patients with an initial IIH diagnosis and follow-up at the Detroit Medical Center (DMC), Michigan, from 1985 to 2002. Medical records of 174 patients were reviewed, with 77 patients fitting the diagnostic criteria.

- **Results**: Seventy-seven patients, 71 females (92.2%) and 6 males (7.8%), were identified. Age ranged from 10 to 50 years, with a mean of 34 years. Fifty patients (65%) were African-American, and 24 patients (31%) were Caucasian. The most common presentation was an isolated headache (28.6%). Nineteen patients (24.7%) were asymptomatic. Obesity was described in 65 of 74 patients (87.8%) evaluated for body dimensions.

- **Conclusions**: We report an increased number of asymptomatic patients after routine ophthalmic examination. Obese females in metropolitan Detroit would benefit from routine eye evaluations to avoid potential visual loss related to papilledema.

### Idiopathic intracranial hypertension: Consensus guidelines on management [^115rRA5o]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2018). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for idiopathic intracranial hypertension, and specifically with respect to history and physical examination, the ABN/BASH/RCOphth/SBNS 2018 guidelines recommend performing an ophthalmological examination to confirm papilledema and assess the imminent risk of visual function. Obtain and record the following in the presence of papilledema:

- **Visual acuity**: Ensure accurate measurement of vision to detect any deficits.
- **Pupil examination**: Evaluate for any anomalies in pupil response that might indicate neurological issues.
- **Intraocular pressure**: Exclude hypotony, a rare cause of disc swelling.
- **Formal visual field test**: Determine any loss in visual field.
- **Dilated fundal examination**: Grade the severity of the papilledema and exclude ocular causes for disc swelling.

### Diagnosis and treatment of idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^113aYMaJ]. Cephalalgia (2021). Low credibility.

Chronic headache is another key symptom of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). It represents the most common reason for IIH patients to seek medical advice as it profoundly impacts the patient's quality of life. While the definition of IIH-related headache by the International Headache Society is relatively unspecific, it frequently has a migrainous phenotype. Differentiating between chronic migraine and IIH-related headache may be challenging. This is further complicated because many IIH patients experience persistent headaches despite the normalization of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure.

The IIHTT and other studies have revealed that there is no correlation between CSF pressure and the presence or intensity of a headache. It is noted that transient improvement following a lumbar puncture is not exclusive to IIH-related headaches; it is also observed in other chronic headaches. When IIH-related headaches exhibit a migrainous phenotype, the accompanying symptoms such as nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia also tend to improve after lumbar puncture. Therefore, a lumbar puncture-induced transient improvement of headaches and accompanying symptoms does not allow differentiation between the pathophysiological origins of IIH-related headaches. Attributing these headaches simply to the direct effect of elevated CSF pressure falls short as a plausible explanation, at least for the majority of IIH patients. Understanding the pathomechanism of IIH-related headaches, including the involved neuronal networks and molecular mediators, would allow us to understand and reliably address them.

### Diagnosis and treatment of idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^11485aSu]. Cephalalgia (2021). Low credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is caused by an elevation of intracranial pressure (ICP). The condition mainly affects obese young women of childbearing age. Its prevalence ranges between 0.5 and 2 per 100,000 of the general population and is expected to increase further given the worldwide increase in obesity. The underlying cause of the disease, as well as the gender preference and its pathophysiological relation to obesity, remain largely unknown.

Several mechanisms have been proposed as the underlying cause of IIH, such as an overproduction of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), outflow obstruction, elevated pressure in the venous sinuses, and more recently, a dysfunction in the glymphatic pathway as well as hormonal alterations. Given that none of these theories can explain the entire clinical picture, therapeutic approaches rely mainly on weight reduction and the decrease of CSF production with carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. As increasing evidence suggests that a CSF overproduction is unlikely to be the driving factor behind IIH, treatment with acetazolamide is likely to target a consequence rather than the cause of this disorder.

The two most prominent symptoms of IIH are progressive visual deterioration resulting from papilledema and chronic headache, although additional symptoms, including cranial nerve palsies, cognitive deficits, tinnitus, and olfactory dysfunction, are frequently also part of the clinical presentation. While the visual dysfunction is known to largely result from a pressure-induced papilledema, the origin of the IIH-related headache is less clear.

### Evolving evidence in adult idiopathic intracranial hypertension: Pathophysiology and management [^1166gubd]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

The diagnostic criteria continue to evolve from symptom-based standards to more quantifiable criteria. The most recent proposal by Friedman et al. reflects the more accepted lumbar puncture (LP) opening pressures of 25 cm CSF or greater in normal weighted adults and 28 cm CSF or greater in children. This proposal includes MRI scan findings consistent with raised intracranial pressure (ICP). Additionally, they have recognized that idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) may occur in the absence of symptoms of elevated ICP and, rarely, in the absence of papilloedema, known as IIH without papilloedema (IIHWOP).

There are several identifiable causes of secondary intracranial hypertension, such as anemia, obstruction to venous drainage, and exposure to various pharmacological agents like tetracyclines, hypervitaminosis A, and retinoids. Neuroimaging, using MRI or CT, must exclude hydrocephalus, structural lesions, abnormal meningeal enhancement, and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis.

Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a chronic endocrine condition characterized by menstrual irregularities, ovarian dysfunction, hyperandrogenism, and hirsutism. The prevalence of PCOS in women with IIH is reported to be as high as 39–57%, compared to 7–18% in the general population. Similar to IIH, PCOS is a disorder prevalent among women of childbearing age, associated with obesity and high serum leptin levels.

### Atypical idiopathic intracranial hypertension: Normal BMI and older patients [^111NekKk]. Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) typically affects young, obese women. We examined two groups of atypical patients with IIH: those with a normal body mass index (BMI) and those at least 50 years of age.

- **Methods**: A retrospective cohort study of 407 consecutive adult patients with IIH with known BMI from three centers was undertaken. Demographics, associated factors, visual acuity, and visual fields were collected at presentation and follow-up.

- **Results**: We identified 18 IIH patients (4%) with normal BMI and 19 (5%) aged 50 years or older at the time of diagnosis who were compared with the remainder of the cohort. Medication-induced IIH was more frequent in patients with normal BMI (28% vs. 7%, p = 0.008). No patient with IIH and a normal BMI had severe visual loss in either eye (0% vs. 17%, p = 0.09). Older patients with IIH had a lower BMI but were still generally obese (33 vs. 38, p = 0.04). Older patients were less likely to report headache as the initial symptom (37% vs. 76%, p < 0.001) and more likely to complain of visual changes (42% vs. 21%, p = 0.03). Treatment of any type was less likely in older patients (significant for medications: 74% vs. 91%, p = 0.004), and they were more likely to have persistent disc edema at the last follow-up (median Frisén grade: 1 vs. 0, p = 0.002), but had similar, if not better, visual outcomes compared with younger patients. A case-control study did not identify any new medication or risk factor associations.

- **Conclusions**: Patients with a normal body mass index and those 50 years or older make up a small proportion of patients with IIH.

### Idiopathic intracranial hypertension: consensus guidelines on management [^114v4iE2]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

In collaboration with many experienced clinicians, professionals, and patient representatives, we have developed guidance statements for the investigation and management of adult idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). We recognize the limitations caused by the lack of high-quality evidence for most of the statements and that adopting a consensus-based approach could lead to reliance on singular opinions. To mitigate this, we sought international expert review (GTL, RHJ, and KD) and input from professional bodies (ABN, BASH, RCOphth, and SBNS). Following these reviews, certain points, such as the definition of typical IIH being associated with obesity (BMI > 25 kg/m²) rather than just being overweight, were upheld by the SIG, differing from published diagnostic criteria. As this document targets a wide audience, including non-IIH specialists, we aimed to establish criteria enabling correct diagnosis of the majority of IIH patients. We emphasized identifying patients where uncertainty may exist and referral to an experienced clinician might be necessary. It was also noted that, compared to our European and North American colleagues, the UK has fewer centers performing optic nerve sheath fenestration (ONSF) for IIH.

These statements are intended as guidance, not mandatory recommendations, for doctors investigating and treating IIH. Despite the limitations of consensus-based methods, these statements reflect an up-to-date consensus aimed at guiding clinicians and serving our patients. Quality prospective research is required to address all areas of uncertainty highlighted in this document.

### Idiopathic intracranial hypertension: A step change in understanding the disease mechanisms [^1119MgUf]. Nature Reviews Neurology (2023). High credibility.

The understanding of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) has evolved over the past few years. Previously, IIH was considered a disease exclusively affecting the neuro-ophthalmic axis, characterized by raised intracranial pressure, headache, and papilloedema, and resulting in the risk of severe and permanent visual loss and life-changing disabling headaches. Recent advances have begun to redefine IIH as a probable metabolic disease involving a range of systemic manifestations. More than 95% of individuals affected by the disease are women of reproductive age with obesity. The incidence is rapidly rising and parallels the escalating worldwide obesity rates.

Contemporary insights identify associations with insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and a twofold increased risk of cardiovascular disease in excess of that driven by obesity alone. Adipose distribution in people with IIH, like that in other metabolic diseases, is preferentially centripetal and is associated with changes in intracranial pressure. Evidence now demonstrates adipose tissue dysfunction in people with IIH, involving transcriptional and metabolic priming for lipogenesis and weight gain. Hormonal perturbations are also observed, including a unique phenotype of androgen excess that promotes cerebrospinal fluid secretion. Knowledge of these additional disease features is driving research into novel therapeutic targets and altering the approach to multidisciplinary care.

### The role of bedside ultrasound in pretherapeutic and posttherapeutic lumbar puncture in patient with idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^112BgbbZ]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), also known as pseudotumor cerebri, is often a debilitating condition characterized by headaches, blurry vision, nausea, and vomiting. Lumbar puncture (LP) is an essential component of the diagnostic and therapeutic approach; however, the procedure itself can cause post-lumbar puncture headache. In addition to the clinical presentation, the use of bedside ultrasound to measure the optic nerve sheath diameter may aid in differentiating the two conditions. We hereby report a case of a 33-year-old woman with known IIH who presented with recurrent headache after the initial therapeutic LP.

It is now well recognized that idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) can occur in children. Relative to the adult population, the demographic features and clinical presentation of IIH, as well as the diagnosis and treatment guidelines for children, are quite different. Although these differences are well established, specific diagnostic and treatment guidelines for pediatric patients have largely been based on the adult literature. Exciting new evidence is now available to assist the clinician in managing pediatric patients with IIH.

### Evolving evidence in adult idiopathic intracranial hypertension: Pathophysiology and management [^116TCJd4]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a rare but important disease associated with significant morbidity. There is an expected rise in its prevalence in line with the escalating global burden of obesity. Modern revisions in the terminology and diagnostic criteria for IIH help guide clinicians in investigations and researchers in standardizing recruitment criteria for clinical trials. The pathophysiology of IIH is incompletely characterized; suggested underpinning mechanisms include the role of cerebrospinal fluid regulation as well as metabolic and endocrinological perspectives. Recent treatment trials are providing insights into management, but debate still surrounds key areas in treatment. This review will provide an up-to-date discussion on the potential pathogenic mechanisms and management of IIH.

### High-pressure headaches: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension and its mimics [^1112cgfr]. Nature Reviews Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a rare disorder that typically affects obese women of childbearing age but can also occur in pediatric populations. Patients usually present with diffuse, daily headaches and visual disturbances, though either symptom can occur in isolation. Many patients with IIH often have papilloedema; however, IIH without papilloedema is fairly common in patients with chronic daily headache. The pathogenesis of IIH is unknown; the high incidence of comorbid bilateral transverse sinus stenosis (BTSS) in patients with IIH suggests that the two conditions are linked, although no direct causal relationship has been established. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure monitoring or lumbar puncture, which provides immediate symptomatic relief, is important in making a diagnosis of IIH.

Treatments for IIH include weight reduction, medical treatment, CSF diversion surgery, optic nerve sheath fenestration, and potentially endovascular stenting in patients with BTSS. Prevention of visual loss, which can be substantial, is the main goal of treatment. Residual headache and IIH recurrence are not uncommon after treatment, and regular follow-up is, therefore, warranted even in patients who achieve remission. This review provides an update of knowledge on the etiology, pathophysiology, and treatment of IIH.

### Disease activity in idiopathic intracranial hypertension: A 3-month follow-up study [^114JkLHm]. Journal of Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a disorder characterized by raised intracranial pressure (ICP) in the absence of identifiable pathology. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical presentation and monitor a 3-month course using frequent optical coherence tomography (OCT) evaluations, visual field testing, and lumbar opening pressure measurements. A longitudinal study included 17 patients with newly diagnosed IIH and 20 healthy overweight controls. Peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (RNFLT) and retinal thickness (RT) measurements (Stratus OCT-3, fast RNFL 3.4 protocol), along with Humphrey visual field testing, were evaluated at regular intervals. A repeat lumbar puncture was performed at the final visit (n = 13).

The diagnostic delay was 3 months with initial symptoms of headache (94%), visual blurring (82%), and pulsatile tinnitus (65%). Complete clinical remission was achieved in 65% of patients, partial remission in 29%, and symptoms remained unchanged in 6%. Total average RNFLT and RT decreased significantly during the follow-up period (p < 0.05). Among patients who achieved weight-loss greater than 3.5% of BMI, ICP decreased significantly (p = 0.0003). In patients with weight-loss less than 3.5% of BMI, changes in ICP were insignificant (p = 0.6). OCT, combined with visual field testing, may be a valuable tool for monitoring IIH patients, although the short-term outcome for IIH remains poor.

### Are the ICHD-3 criteria for headache attributed to idiopathic intracranial hypertension valid? Headache phenotyping and field-testing in newly diagnosed idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^1154aL4q]. Cephalalgia (2024). High credibility.

Headache burden is substantial in idiopathic intracranial hypertension. The classification of idiopathic intracranial hypertension headache by the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD) is an important tool for research and clinical purposes.

- **Methods**: We phenotyped headaches and tested the sensitivity and specificity of the ICHD-3 criteria for idiopathic intracranial hypertension headache in a prospective cohort of patients suspected of idiopathic intracranial hypertension at two tertiary headache centers.

- **Results**: Sensitivity was 93% and specificity was 100% for the ICHD-3 criteria for idiopathic intracranial hypertension-related headache, validated in idiopathic intracranial hypertension (n = 140) and patients in whom idiopathic intracranial hypertension was suspected but disproven (n = 103). The phenotype of new or worsened headaches related to idiopathic intracranial hypertension suspicion was equally migraine-like (p = 0.76) and tension-type-like (p = 0.08). Lumbar puncture opening pressure was higher (p < 0.0001) and pulsatile tinnitus more frequent (p < 0.0001) in idiopathic intracranial hypertension patients, but neither improved the applicability of the headache criteria, nor did papilledema.

- **Conclusion**: Headache phenotype is not distinct in idiopathic intracranial hypertension. ICHD-3 criteria for idiopathic intracranial hypertension headache are sensitive and specific, but simplicity can be improved without compromising accuracy. We propose that a new or worsened headache temporally related to active idiopathic intracranial hypertension is a suff…

### Paediatric idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^113TnSaj]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Low credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) can occur in the paediatric population with clinical characteristics that may differ from adult presentations. The authors present a case of an 11-year-old boy who had been experiencing severe holocranial headaches for the past four weeks. Best-corrected visual acuities (BCVA) were 20/200 bilaterally, and fundus examination showed marked bilateral optic disc and macular oedema. CT scan with contrast and MRI showed no space-occupying lesions, normal permeability of the dural venous sinuses, and a partially empty sella. Lumbar puncture revealed an opening pressure of 540 mm Hg, with clear cerebrospinal fluid and normal biochemistry and cytology. The patient was treated medically and subsequently underwent a ventriculoperitoneal shunting procedure. Three months after surgery, the symptoms completely resolved, and his BCVA were 20/20 bilaterally.

### Therapeutic lumbar puncture for headache in idiopathic intracranial hypertension: Minimal gain, is it worth the pain [^116PmTw6]. Cephalalgia (2019). Low credibility.

Methods

- **Participants**: Patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) were prospectively recruited from the out-patients department at University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, a United Kingdom tertiary referral hospital. Patients were asked to consent to lumbar puncture (LP) for research purposes. Eligibility criteria included fulfillment of the updated modified Dandy criteria, which required no evidence of intracranial pathology or venous sinus thrombosis via magnetic resonance or computerized tomography imaging and venography at diagnosis, and LP opening pressure ≥ 25 cmCSF. Consequently, all patients had undergone a previous diagnostic LP. Only those with active IIH, characterized by papilloedema with a Frisén grade ≥ 1 and LP opening pressure ≥ 25 cmCSF at the time of study recruitment, were included. To avoid recruitment bias, all those prospectively screened that met the eligibility criteria were informed of the study and offered participation.

- **Patient consents**: Patients provided written informed consent to participate in the study. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and approval was obtained through Research Ethics Committees (13/YH/0366 and 14/WM/0011).

- **Patient assessment**: Eligibility was confirmed following assessment by a neuro-ophthalmological examination, which included fundus photography with subsequent grading of the papilloedema (Frisén grade 0–5, with 5 being the most severe) performed by three masked reviewers. Patient demographics were recorded. A standardized LP was performed using a Quincke type point, 20GA 3.50 IN, 0.9 mm × 90 mm (Becton Dickinson™, Spain) spinal needle. An ultrasound scan was utilized to m

### The idiopathic intracranial hypertension prospective cohort study: Evaluation of prognostic factors and outcomes [^115n8rX5]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Low credibility.

Results

This analysis includes 490 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), with a mean disease duration of 17 months (range 0–312 months). Of these, 161 patients had a single visit, while 329 had multiple visits, with a mean of 4 visits (range 2–17 encounters). Those attending more than once had a mean duration of follow-up of 23.5 months (range 0–87 months).

Baseline characteristics indicate very few men within this cohort (n = 9), resulting in a women-to-men ratio of 53:1. In the medically managed cohort (n = 426), at their first visit, 281 patients had active IIH, and 145 were noted to have IIH in ocular remission. In the surgery cohort, all 38 patients at their first visit had active IIH, and 26 were in ocular remission, having either undergone surgery prior to enrollment or subsequently due to relapse.

### Isolated third cranial nerve palsy in benign idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^111DH3z8]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is marked by increased intracranial pressure without any accompanying clinical, imaging, or laboratory findings of intracranial pathology. In addition to headache, nausea, and vomiting, typical symptoms might also include diplopia, photophobia, and blurred vision. Third nerve palsy is rarely linked to IIH, although sixth nerve palsy is reported in the majority of individuals with IIH. This paper describes the unique case of a woman in her 50s with solitary IIH-related oculomotor nerve palsy. Dilated pupils, ptosis, and medial rectus palsy of the right side were observed during the neurological examination, and grade 1 papilledema was found during the fundus examination. Based on the features of elevated intracranial pressure observed on MRI/magnetic resonance venography and CT scans, IIH was recognized as the most plausible explanation for the patient's symptoms.

### Current concepts and strategies in the diagnosis and management of idiopathic intracranial hypertension in adults [^111bGAQE]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Since obesity has become an epidemic in industrialized nations, idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is now a more common neuro-ophthalmic disorder that causes visual loss and headaches. This review highlights the new diagnostic criteria for IIH and the new insights into its pathophysiologic mechanisms.

- **Key diagnostic and monitoring techniques**: These include neuroimaging and the measurement of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure, along with perimetry, optical coherence tomography, and ocular sonography.

- **Medical therapy**: The main findings of the Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension Treatment Trial (IIHTT) support acetazolamide as the mainstay for medical therapy.

- **Surgical procedures**: CSF diversion procedures, endovascular venous sinus stenting, and optic nerve sheath fenestration are surgical options when IIH is refractory to medical treatment or when it presents fulminantly.

Future clinical trials comparing these procedures will help develop better paradigms in the surgical management of IIH.

At the baseline clinical visit, following confirmation of a diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), disease status was determined. Active IIH was defined as those with active papilloedema Frisén grade ≥ 1 in at least one eye, and IIH in ocular remission was defined as those with no evidence of papilloedema.

IIH relapse was defined as a change from Frisén 0 to 1 based on retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) measures from ≤ 100 µm to ≥ 109 µm in the same eye.

### Idiopathic intracranial hypertension: Consensus guidelines on management [^1176TxFh]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) occurs predominantly in women and, although the underlying pathogenesis is not fully understood, it has a striking association with obesity. The combination of raised intracranial pressure, without hydrocephalus or mass lesion, normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) composition, and where no underlying etiology is found are accepted criteria for the diagnosis of IIH. The overall age-adjusted and gender-adjusted annual incidence is increasing and was reported to be 2.4 per 100,000 within the last decade (2002–2014).

The majority of patients presenting with IIH have symptoms that include a headache that is progressively more severe and frequent, as defined by the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition (ICHD-3), which is depicted in Figure 1. The headache phenotype is highly variable and may mimic other primary headache disorders. Other symptoms may include transient visual obscurations (unilateral or bilateral darkening of the vision typically lasting seconds), pulsatile tinnitus, back pain, dizziness, neck pain, visual blurring, cognitive disturbances, radicular pain, and typically horizontal diplopia, as shown in Figure 1A. None of these symptoms are pathognomonic for IIH. Investigation and management depend on symptoms and signs and require an interdisciplinary team approach.

### Emerging themes in idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^112wXduu]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is considered a rare condition. Previously, the incidence within the general population was believed to be between 0.5 and 2 per 100,000. Recent evaluations in the UK, including the largest cohort study at the time of writing, reported a 108% increase from 2.26 to 4.69 per 100,000 between 2002 and 2016. Another large case-controlled cohort study found the incidence of IIH in females had tripled from 2.5 to 9.3 per 100,000 between 2005 and 2017. Secondary to the rising incidence of IIH is the healthcare cost of the disorder: annual hospital costs in England rose from £9.2 million to £49.9 million between 2002 and 2014 and were predicted to rise to £462.7 million by 2030. In 2007 in the US, IIH patients had exceptionally high admission rates of 38% of all those coded with IIH for that year, with costs exceeding $444 million. This estimate also included lost work income. Repeat hospital admissions may reflect that IIH is a disease of social deprivation, but they also highlight the ineffectiveness of IIH treatment for decades.

Obesity (> 90%), female sex, and reproductive age are significant risk factors associated with IIH. An epidemiology study in the US found that women have an eight times likelihood of developing the disorder compared to men, a risk significantly increased when they are overweight and of reproductive age (20–44 years), with an incidence of 12–20 per 100,000. Pediatric studies of IIH are not well established; however, one UK study found an incidence of 0.71 per 100,000, which was found to increase with age. For children aged 12–15 years, there is also an association with obesity.

### Idiopathic intracranial hypertension: Consensus guidelines on management [^112b4a6g]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

- **Neurovascular stenting for headaches**: Should neurovascular stenting be used in patients with IIH with headache alone? The literature detailing stenting typically does not clearly separate the cohorts of IIH into those with visual loss, those with headaches alone, and those with both. They also typically do not separate those with acute IIH, those with chronic IIH, and those with IIH in ocular remission. Another major limitation is that case series are non-randomized. Typically, they do not detail morphological stenosis type; they tend to be small in size with selection bias, and there is a lack of long-term follow-up. Currently, neurovascular stenting is not a treatment for headache in IIH.

- **Uncertainty**: Patients with IIH often develop migrainous headaches superimposed on the headaches secondary to raised intracranial pressure. While CSF diversion procedures have not been shown to be effective for the management of headaches, this may be attributable to the migrainous component not being optimally addressed. Conversely, failure to optimize the ICP with CSF diversion procedures may render the migrainous headache difficult to treat. CSF diversion procedures for the management of headaches should only be carried out in a multidisciplinary setting and following a period of intracranial pressure monitoring.

- **Management of headaches in shunted patients with IIH**: Shunted patients with IIH may have significant headache morbidity. Shunt failures and overdrainage should always be considered, as understanding the underlying causes may guide management. Shunt revision should not routinely be undertaken unless necessary.

### Syphilis mimicking idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^116NULca]. BMJ Case Reports (2011). Low credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a condition of yet unknown etiology, affecting predominantly obese females of childbearing age. It is a diagnosis of exclusion, as raised cerebrospinal fluid pressure may occur secondary to numerous other medical conditions. An atypical phenotype or an atypical disease course should alert the physician to reevaluate a presumed IIH diagnosis. The authors report a case of a 32-year-old non-obese male with intracranial hypertension secondary to a syphilitic central nervous system infection, initially misdiagnosed as being idiopathic. Upon receiving relevant antibiotic treatment, signs and symptoms of elevated intracranial pressure resolved completely. Syphilis is a rare but very important differential diagnosis that, in this case, was clinically indistinguishable from IIH.

### Emerging themes in idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^1131B3Y1]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

Headache in idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a chronic disabler and significantly reduces quality of life. There are few clinical studies characterizing IIH headache. Previously, IIH headaches were considered "high pressure" and, therefore, aggravated by the Valsalva manoeuvre, worse when supine, and often present on waking or causing the patient to wake from sleep. However, more recent studies indicate that the majority of headaches in IIH meet the International Headache Society criteria for either episodic migraine, chronic migraine, or tension-type headache. In the Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension Treatment Trial (IIHTT), 84% of participants had headaches at baseline. The relationship between intracranial pressure (ICP) and headache in IIH remains complicated. Although a reduction in ICP was found to alleviate headache in weight loss studies, the severity, frequency, and disability of headaches did not correlate with lumbar puncture opening pressure at baseline in the IIHTT.

The authors reviewed medical records of 82 patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) to determine the frequency of headaches occurring after the initial diagnosis and treatment of IIH, classifiable by the International Headache Society guidelines. Sixty-eight percent of patients had definable headache disorders, including episodic tension-type headache (30%) and migraine without aura (20%). Patients with IIH frequently experience other types of headaches, not necessarily related to increased intracranial pressure.

### Idiopathic intracranial hypertension: Consensus guidelines on management [^111jc8V5]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Clinicians debate the absolute lumbar puncture (LP) opening value of 25 cm CSF as diagnostic of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). This was recognized by Friedman and colleagues. Below the cut-off of 25 cm CSF, there are reservations about diagnosing IIH. As highlighted in Figure 1E, the SIG clinicians' opinions suggest there is an increasing significance of LP opening pressure (OP) measurement as it rises. The LP OP is a single measurement, and it is widely recognized that there is a diurnal and wide variation in CSF pressure.

Where the LP OP does not fit the clinical picture, it should be interpreted with caution. A repeat LP may be considered, or intracranial intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring could be considered. There is no evidence to dictate how much CSF is recommended to be drained or what the closing pressure should be.

- **Exclusion of secondary causes of raised ICP**: All patients should have a careful history taken to exclude any possible secondary causes linked to raised intracranial hypertension, although the causal link with IIH and a number of diseases and medications is not clear. All patients should have a full blood count performed to exclude anemia. Where patients are deemed atypical, additional blood tests may be considered to exclude secondary causes. Additional neuroimaging might be considered, including more proximal imaging of the neck vasculature to exclude internal jugular obstruction.

### Evolving evidence in adult idiopathic intracranial hypertension: Pathophysiology and management [^114Rijdk]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

The nomenclature and diagnostic criteria used to describe this condition have evolved over time. The first case of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), then termed serous meningitis, was probably reported in the 1890s by Henrich Quincke, a German physician, when lumbar puncture (LP) was first introduced. Nonne described a series of cases, similar to Dandy, of raised intracranial pressure (ICP) without tumor termed pseudotumor cerebri. Both series contained cases that we now recognize as raised ICP secondary to a known etiology.

The maturing nomenclature and diagnostic criteria have reflected the advances in investigating patients, particularly neuroimaging and understanding of normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) opening pressure measurements, and our increasing appreciation of the clinical course of the disease. Some patients have a mild and self-limiting course, while others experience substantial morbidity from visual loss and persistent headache.

### Idiopathic intracranial hypertension in atypical demographics [^1129Bz9Z]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2022). Low credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a condition that most often occurs in women of reproductive age with elevated body mass index (BMI) (typical patients). Individuals outside of this demographic group (atypical patients) may have a different pathophysiology underlying raised intracranial pressure (ICP) leading to unique clinical presentations and prognosis.

- **Methods**: Retrospective chart review was conducted on patients with IIH in typical and atypical demographic groups, including men, those diagnosed at age 40 or older, and those with BMI < 26.0 kg/m².

- **Results**: A total of 193 typical and 50 atypical patients with IIH were included. Age at diagnosis was higher in men and patients with normal BMI (37.2 ± 11.8 and 32.3 ± 9.8 years versus 27.3 ± 5.6 years). Older patients presented with headaches less often than typical patients (42.9% versus 77.2%). Opening pressure on lumbar puncture (LP) and degree of optic disc edema were not significantly different between groups, though men had worse mean deviation (MD) on visual fields (VFs) (10.16 ± 10.40 dB versus 4.52 ± 5.53 dB in the typical group). There was no significant difference between the typical and atypical groups in visual outcomes, including the number of patients requiring surgical treatment, development of optic atrophy, and presence of persistent papilledema, though a trend toward worse VF MD was seen in men. In a pooled analysis of all patients, MD on VF at presentation was the only significant predictor of final visual outcome.

- **Conclusion**: Men and patients with normal BMI are diagnosed with IIH later in life.

### Evolving evidence in adult idiopathic intracranial hypertension: Pathophysiology and management [^115zcDhL]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

The incidence and prevalence of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) depend on the geographical location of the population studied. Andrews et al. highlighted the diversity in the worldwide epidemiology for IIH and cautioned against comparing the rates because of inconsistent definitions of obesity used in various studies. Evidence from the literature suggests an incidence of between 1 and 3 per 100,000 per year in the general population. When stratified by reproductive age, female gender, and weight, the incidence rises by 12–28 per 100,000 per year.

### Idiopathic intracranial hypertension in pregnancy. A systematic review on clinical course, treatments, delivery and maternal–fetal outcome [^112En68R]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

Despite the reassuring nature of the study, it emphasizes that pregnancy should not be universally avoided in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). Disease control, however, should be optimized before planned pregnancies whenever possible, particularly concerning papilledema and other maternal risk factors.

Thus, meticulous weight control remains the only disease-modifying risk factor for first-line personalized management, even though it is challenging during pregnancy due to the peculiar distribution of adipose tissue. Although often underreported, IIH in pregnancy may also be associated with mood disturbances such as depression and anxiety, which in turn are predictors of postpartum depression and impairments in memory and concentration. Therefore, clinicians should consider the importance of psychological support for these women during pregnancy and puerperium.

- **Ophthalmological surveillance**: Regular monitoring of campimetric parameters can play a crucial role in the timely discovery of a visual field constriction (VFC) and the unmasking of latent IIH. Although no set guidelines exist for the frequency of visual field and fundoscopic examinations, monitoring should be tailored to the patient's history of IIH, the degree of spontaneous or pharmacological compensation before onset during pregnancy, and clinical status. If vision remains consistently stable, the visual field test interval can be set monthly or bimonthly, whereas in the case of papilledema or initial VFC, weekly assessments should be recommended.

### Evolving evidence in adult idiopathic intracranial hypertension: Pathophysiology and management [^117Gz9hq]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a rare but important disease associated with significant morbidity. There is an expected rise in prevalence in line with the escalating global burden of obesity. Modern revisions in the terminology and diagnostic criteria for IIH help guide clinicians in investigations and researchers in standardizing recruitment criteria for clinical trials. The pathophysiology of IIH is incompletely characterized; suggested underpinning mechanisms include the role of cerebrospinal fluid regulation as well as metabolic and endocrinological perspectives.

Recent treatment trials are providing insights into the management, but debate still surrounds key areas in treatment. This review provides an up-to-date discussion on the potential pathogenic mechanisms and management of IIH.

For optimal investigation of patients with papilloedema, clear communication between clinicians is essential for seamless joint investigation across various specialties. The aims of investigating papilloedema are to find any underlying treatable cause in a timely manner, protect the vision, and ensure timely re-examination when vision is at risk. Additionally, it enables the onward care of the patient with input from the most appropriate experienced clinician.

- **Diagnostic principles**: Blood pressure must be measured to exclude malignant hypertension, defined as diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 120 mm Hg or systolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 180 mm Hg. All patients should undergo an ophthalmology examination to confirm papilloedema and assess the imminent risk to their visual function. The following should be recorded in the presence of papilloedema: visual acuity, pupil examination, and intraocular pressure (to exclude hypotony, a rare cause for disc swelling). Formal visual field tests (perimetry) and dilated fundal examinations should be conducted to grade the severity of the papilloedema and exclude ocular causes for disc swelling.

Where possible, the fundus picture should be documented with drawings, noting key findings on the optic nerve head, including hyperaemia, haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, and obscuration of the vessels. Photographs and/or optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging are useful. Where visual function is threatened, regular ophthalmic examination is crucial as it will influence the treatment approach.

### Diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension - the importance of excluding secondary causes: A systematic review [^114iox9c]. Cephalalgia (2022). Low credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is characterized by increased intracranial pressure without any pathological findings on neuroimaging, except for signs of high intracranial pressure. Before diagnosing idiopathic intracranial hypertension, secondary causes of increased intracranial pressure should be excluded.

- **Objective**: To characterize the phenotype of patients with secondary intracranial hypertension and to identify possible risk factors for secondary intracranial hypertension.

- **Methods**: We systematically searched the PubMed database. The publications were analyzed according to several factors including patient phenotype, age, gender, comorbidities, body mass index/weight status, and additional medication. The results are summarized in four categories: medication, infection, hormonally induced intracranial hypertension, and miscellaneous groups of diseases related to secondary intracranial hypertension (sIH).

- **Results**: We identified 105 eligible papers which included 272 cases. There were 49.6% pediatric cases. Among the adult group, 70.9% were women. A total of 40.4% of all cases were obese or overweight, with 27% among adults and 13.4% among pediatric cases. Increased BMI and recent weight gain, anemia, renal diseases, and hypertension were the most frequent comorbidities related to sIH.

- **Conclusion**: Among sIH patients, 40.4% were obese or overweight; two-thirds were women. We recommend that even patients with a typical idiopathic intracranial hypertension phenotype should be screened for secondary causes.

When papilloedema is identified, it is critical to measure blood pressure to exclude malignant hypertension. All mandatory tests of visual function should be recorded, including visual acuity, color vision, pupil examination, and a dilated eye examination to document the optic nerve head and macular findings, excluding an ocular cause for bilateral disc swelling. Eye movements should also be tested, as an esotropia at a distance may be the only sign of a partial sixth nerve palsy. With papilloedema, visual acuity may be normal or near-normal, so this measure alone is not predictive of disease severity. Formal visual fields using manual or automated perimetry are required. Papilloedema demonstrates a variety of visual field defects, including the enlargement of the blind spot, inferonasal defects, as well as central, paracentral, arcuate, and altitudinal scotomas.

### Idiopathic intracranial hypertension: Review of clinical syndrome, imaging findings, and treatment [^114Kh9cs]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2019). Low credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a syndrome of unknown cause that is increasing in frequency. Patients, typically women of childbearing age and who are obese, present with headaches and may also experience visual changes that can become chronic. This review aims to describe the possible mechanisms for this disease and to illustrate the increasing role of imaging in diagnosing this disorder. Various methods of treatment, including medical and surgical, will be reviewed.

The fact that idiopathic intracranial hypertension has undergone many name changes over the years serves as a reminder that the underlying mechanism is still not well understood. Although several possible mechanisms can cause increased intracranial pressure, it remains uncertain which of these mechanisms is involved. The role of imaging has significantly changed in the evaluation of patients with possible IIH.

- **Diagnosis**: Imaging is involved in ruling out secondary causes of increased intracranial pressure. Ample evidence now contradicts the previously held belief that imaging of patients with IIH should appear normal. Instead, there are subtle findings that radiologists need to identify, such as a partially empty sella, flattening of the posterior globe, cupping of optic disks, and distension of the optic nerve sheaths.

- **Intracranial venography**: The role of intracranial venography is growing due to findings that a very high percentage of patients have dural venous sinus stenosis.

The underlying pathogenesis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is uncertain. Raised intracranial pressure (ICP) is a uniform characteristic, but the mechanism by which ICP is elevated in IIH is not clear. It is also questionable whether a single unifying mechanism elevates ICP in these individuals. Secondary causative factors that lead to elevation of ICP may be mechanistically distinct from truly idiopathic causes.

- **Pathophysiology**: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is produced mainly by the choroid plexus epithelial cells, with a small amount secreted by ependymal cells lining the ventricular system. Classically, CSF was thought to drain predominantly through the subarachnoid space via arachnoid granulations into the superior sagittal sinus. Evidence also suggests that CSF drains through the cribriform plate along cranial nerves into the nasal lymphatics. The most recent hypothesis proposes bulk flow of fluid along perivascular routes, known as the glymphatic pathway, which is cleared from the brain into the subarachnoid CSF, bloodstream, or cervical lymphatics. Supporting this concept is the recent discovery of lymphatic vessels in the dura that drain into the deep cervical lymph nodes.

- **Role of altered CSF dynamics**: Changes in the volume of blood, CSF, and brain tissue influence ICP. IIH likely represents a disorder of CSF regulation, potentially through CSF hypersecretion or reduced drainage.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for idiopathic intracranial hypertension, specifically in relation to history and physical examination, the ABN/BASH/RCOphth/SBNS 2018 guidelines recommend performing a cranial nerve examination. It is recognized that typically there should be no cranial nerve involvement other than sixth cranial nerve palsy in patients with suspected idiopathic intracranial hypertension. An alternative diagnosis should be suspected if other cranial nerves and/or other pathological findings are observed.

Headache is the most common presenting feature in idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) and leads to significant morbidity. Many patients do not have the classical headache phenotype attributed to raised intracranial pressure (ICP). The International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD 3), which does not specify a particular headache phenotype, has poor specificity (53%) in IIH. Many patients with IIH experience daily headaches (86%) that often resemble migraines or tension-type headaches. Although there are features from the history that can be useful, they are not pathognomonic and can occur in both IIH and headache control subjects, such as exacerbation with bending (50% in IIH, 44% in controls), morning headache (20% in IIH, 29% in controls), and exacerbation with cough or Valsalva (70% in IIH, 35% in controls). Post-lumbar puncture (LP), there is an improvement in headache in 72% of IIH patients, but improvement also occurs in 25% of those with headaches without IIH or a pressure syndrome.

Most headache improvement occurs during the first month following diagnosis and treatment, with constant headaches in 64% at diagnosis improving to 13% by one month. However, 63% continue to experience headaches at 12 months, and headaches can persist even after ICP has normalized in 67% of patients. Headache outcomes are poor even in those with no prior history of headache, with 57% still experiencing headaches at 12 months. There is little evidence to guide the management of headaches attributed to IIH. Accurate headache phenotyping is crucial, and mixed headache types frequently coexist, including high pressure, migraine, tension-type, and low pressure in those with a shunt. Medication overuse headaches often occur and are underdiagnosed.

### Understanding the pathophysiology of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH): A review of recent developments [^113NEVsG]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2024). Low credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a condition of significant morbidity and rising prevalence. It typically affects young people living with obesity, mostly women of reproductive age, and can present with headaches, visual abnormalities, tinnitus, and cognitive dysfunction. Raised intracranial pressure without a secondary identified cause remains a key diagnostic feature of this condition; however, the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms that drive this increase are poorly understood.

Previous theories have focused on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hypersecretion or impaired reabsorption. However, the recent characterization of the glymphatic system in many other neurological conditions necessitates a re-evaluation of these hypotheses. Further, the impact of metabolic dysfunction and hormonal dysregulation in this population group must also be considered. Given the emerging evidence, it is likely that IIH is triggered by the interaction of multiple aetiological factors that ultimately results in the disruption of CSF dynamics. This review aims to provide a comprehensive update on the theories regarding the pathogenesis of IIH.

### Idiopathic intracranial hypertension: Clinical nosography and field-testing of the ICHD diagnostic criteria. A case-control study [^114Zv2R5]. Cephalalgia (2015). Low credibility.

The aims of this article are to characterize the headache in idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) and to field-test the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD) diagnostic criteria for headache attributed to IIH.

- **Materials and methods**: We included 44 patients with new-onset IIH. Thirty-four patients with suspected but unconfirmed IIH served as controls. Headache and other IIH-related symptoms were assessed by a detailed standardized interview. In participants referred before diagnostic lumbar puncture (n = 67), we recorded headache intensity before and after cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) withdrawal.

- **Results**: Headache in patients with IIH was daily occurring in 86%, focal in 84%, and pulsating in 52%. Aggravation of headache by coughing or straining and relief after CSF withdrawal were significantly more frequent in patients than in controls (p ≤ 0.002). From the ICHD-2 to the ICHD-3 beta classification, the sensitivity increased from 60% to 86%, whereas the specificity decreased from 86% to 53%. Based on our data, the headache criteria can be revised to increase sensitivity to 95% and specificity to 65%.

- **Conclusion**: Aggravation of headache by coughing or straining, relief after CSF withdrawal, retrobulbar pain, and pulsatile tinnitus may suggest intracranial hypertension. Based on data from a well-defined IIH cohort, we propose a revision of the ICHD-3 beta diagnostic criteria with improved clinical applicability and increased sensitivity and specificity.

### Clinical features of pediatric idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^116EmUUz]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2019). Low credibility.

This study consists of a retrospective chart review of patients diagnosed with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) seen at a tertiary care children's hospital (Children's Hospital and Medical Center, Omaha, NE, USA). The protocol was approved by the University of Nebraska Medical Center Institutional Review Board (IRB# 640–15-EP), and the study was carried out in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. As this study was a retrospective chart review, the requirement for consent has been waived.

The aim of the study was to gain insight into pediatric IIH; therefore, only patients under the age of 18 were included. During the review, attention was paid to demographic characteristics (e.g. age, gender), clinical presentation (e.g. headaches, papilledema), imaging, and lumbar puncture results. Lumbar punctures were performed as per hospital protocol in the lateral decubitus position under general anesthesia.

Cases of IIH were further evaluated to ensure they met the diagnostic criteria of IIH based on the Modified Dandy Criteria and Revised Diagnostic criteria set forth by Friedman et al. Diagnostic criteria included the presence of papilledema, normal neurological exam, normal neuroimaging, normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) composition, and opening pressure > 28 mmHg. This criterion defines definite IIH, while the absence of papilledema resulted in a probable IIH designation. Patients were classified as obese or non-obese based on the 2000 Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) body mass index for age percentile growth charts. Cases were divided into pre-pubertal (12 years and under) and pubertal (13 years and above) groups.

### Evolving evidence in adult idiopathic intracranial hypertension: Pathophysiology and management [^117R9TwQ]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is characterized by raised intracranial pressure (ICP) of unknown cause when all other causes of raised ICP have been excluded. IIH causes significant morbidity, including permanent visual loss in up to 25% of cases, with reports of 1–2% of new cases being registered blind per year, and a disabling headache in the majority. With peak presentation being between ages 20 and 40 years, an overwhelming female predominance, and a strong association with obesity, IIH is well known as a disorder that affects overweight women of reproductive age.

There are a number of indicators that the incidence and prevalence of IIH are rising, likely related to the increasing prevalence of obesity worldwide; WHO indicates a twofold increase in the UK between 1997 and 2002 and a threefold increase in the United States between 1990 and 2006. A recent epidemiology study reported an incidence of IIH occurring in 28/100,000/year, which is the highest reported rate in the literature so far. In the United States, there was a 320% increase in new cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunt procedures for IIH between 1998 and 2002. IIH is an expensive condition for society and the individual: in the United States, total economic costs are estimated at greater than US$444 million per annum, and 57% of patients report significant lost earnings with 31% changing occupation.

The aetiology and pathology are not fully established, and the disorder has become the subject of increasing scientific scrutiny over the last decade. With no single cause implicated, uncertainties surround the best therapeutics, which have

### Incidence, prevalence, and health care outcomes in idiopathic intracranial hypertension: A population study [^1157MrYQ]. Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a condition of unknown etiology that is strongly associated with obesity. IIH predominantly affects women of childbearing age and causes chronic disabling headaches, visual disturbance, and, in a minority of patients, permanent visual loss. The definitive management is weight loss, but a minority of patients require surgery to preserve vision. People with IIH potentially have high rates of health care utilization due to their comorbidities, multiple specialist consultations, diagnostic tests, CSF diversion procedures, and complications related to CSF diversion surgery.

Given the increasing global burden of obesity and the strong association of IIH with obesity, it would seem plausible to assume that the incidence of IIH, as well as associated health care utilization, is increasing. Although there is some evidence to support this, overall, there is a paucity of data regarding the epidemiology, health care utilization, and outcomes of people with IIH. To our knowledge, there have not been any large population-level studies of IIH in Wales.

In this retrospective cohort study, we aimed to determine the temporal trends of IIH incidence and prevalence in Wales and health care utilization associated with IIH. We also investigated the effects of socioeconomic deprivation and obesity on IIH epidemiology.
