## Question

Phentermine and methotrexate

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether phentermine and methotrexate interact, and if so, how clinically significant that interaction is. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about authoritative drug–drug interaction sources. Then, I should verify mechanistic plausibility by reviewing phentermine's pharmacology and methotrexate's disposition. Next, I will check major methotrexate interaction lists for any mention of sympathomimetics. After that, I should review phentermine's known interaction profile for any overlap with methotrexate pathways. Finally, I will synthesize a clinical recommendation and monitoring plan, while keeping in mind dose contexts for low- versus high-dose methotrexate and patient-specific risk factors [^11379vQh] [^112iEPBZ] [^112aMq35].

> Let me first confirm the direct evidence. I checked DrugBank's curated interaction checker, which reports no known interaction between phentermine and methotrexate, which is a strong initial signal that there is no established pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction between these two agents [^11379vQh].

> Wait, let me verify the mechanistic plausibility before concluding. Phentermine is a sympathomimetic amine that increases norepinephrine release and is not a substrate or inhibitor of renal organic anion transporters (OAT1/3), nor does it meaningfully alter renal function or compete for protein binding in ways that would be expected to raise free methotrexate concentrations; methotrexate, in contrast, is renally cleared and variably protein bound, with clinically important interactions typically arising from transporter competition, protein-binding displacement, or folate pathway modulation, none of which are implicated by phentermine's mechanism of action [^113gVHp2] [^112iEPBZ] [^112PEqyP].

> I need to check methotrexate's major interaction lists to ensure I'm not missing a sympathomimetic entry. The FDA labeling highlights increased methotrexate exposure with NSAIDs, penicillins and sulfonamides, antifolates, PPIs, probenecid, and other nephro- or hepatotoxic agents, but does not list sympathomimetics such as phentermine among interacting drugs, which supports the absence of a recognized interaction signal [^112iEPBZ] [^112PEqyP].

> Next, I should review phentermine's interaction profile to see if there is any indirect overlap. Phentermine's labeled contraindications and interactions center on MAO inhibitors, other weight-loss agents, adrenergic neuron blockers, and agents affecting blood pressure; there is no mention of antifolates, renal transporter substrates, or folate-pathway drugs, which again argues against a mechanistic or clinical interaction with methotrexate [^111G1Cqp] [^112aMq35].

> Hold on, I should verify whether dose context changes the calculus. Many methotrexate interactions are more pronounced with high-dose regimens used in oncology, where even small changes in clearance can be consequential; however, even in that high-dose context, authoritative interaction summaries and oncology guidelines do not cite sympathomimetics as problematic co-medications, reinforcing that phentermine is unlikely to alter methotrexate exposure or toxicity risk [^112RCB2r] [^113kLicF].

> But wait, what if there are additive adverse effects rather than a pharmacokinetic interaction? Phentermine can raise blood pressure and heart rate, and methotrexate can cause mucositis, cytopenias, and hepatic injury; these are distinct, non-synergistic toxicities, so the main clinical task is to monitor each drug's known adverse effects rather than assume an interaction-driven amplification of risk [^113mt71L] [^1168K4a1].

> I should double-check practical monitoring so the recommendation is safe. For methotrexate, follow standard rheumatology and dermatology guidance: baseline and periodic CBC, LFTs, and renal function, with closer labs if dose changes or intercurrent illness occur; for phentermine, monitor blood pressure and heart rate at baseline and during therapy, and avoid in patients with uncontrolled hypertension or significant cardiovascular disease, aligning with obesity pharmacotherapy guidance [^1154F81C] [^1134BcuM] [^111Et597].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. There is no established pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction between phentermine and methotrexate, and coadministration is generally acceptable with routine monitoring for each agent's known adverse effects and contraindications; if methotrexate is used at high oncologic doses, apply heightened vigilance for delayed clearance and toxicity, but this pertains to renal function and interacting co-meds like PPIs or NSAIDs, not to phentermine [^11379vQh] [^112iEPBZ] [^112RCB2r].

---

Phentermine and methotrexate do not have a **clinically significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction**. Phentermine is a sympathomimetic amine for short-term weight loss [^1134BcuM], while methotrexate is a folate antagonist for autoimmune and oncologic use [^111YHbSp]. No evidence shows that phentermine alters methotrexate absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion, or that methotrexate affects phentermine pharmacokinetics. The main concern is **additive hepatotoxicity**, as both can affect the liver; monitor liver function tests when used together. Phentermine is contraindicated with MAO inhibitors [^111G1Cqp] and may raise blood pressure [^113mt71L], so use caution in patients with cardiovascular disease or uncontrolled hypertension [^111Et597]. Methotrexate requires routine CBC, LFTs, and renal function monitoring [^1154F81C]; no special interaction-specific monitoring is needed beyond standard care.

## Pharmacological profiles

Key pharmacological characteristics of phentermine and methotrexate:

| **Aspect** | **Phentermine** | **Methotrexate** |
|-|-|-|
| Mechanism of action | Sympathomimetic amine that increases norepinephrine release, suppressing appetite [^113gVHp2] | Folate antagonist inhibiting dihydrofolate reductase, disrupting DNA synthesis [^111YHbSp] |
| Indications | Short-term weight loss adjunct in obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m² or ≥ 27 kg/m² with comorbidities) [^113gVHp2] | Rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and certain cancers [^notfound] |
| Metabolism | Hepatic metabolism; primarily excreted unchanged in urine [^notfound] | Partial hepatic metabolism; primarily renally excreted [^notfound] |
| Adverse effects | Elevated blood pressure, tachycardia, insomnia, dry mouth, constipation, and rare pulmonary hypertension or valvular disease [^113mt71L] | Hepatotoxicity, myelosuppression, mucositis, and pulmonary toxicity [^1168K4a1] |

---

## Potential drug interactions

### Pharmacokinetic interactions

There is **no evidence** that phentermine meaningfully alters methotrexate absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion, or vice versa. Phentermine's hepatic metabolism and renal excretion do not interfere with methotrexate's pathways, and methotrexate does not affect phentermine pharmacokinetics.

---

### Pharmacodynamic interactions

The main concern is **additive hepatotoxicity**, as both drugs can affect the liver. Methotrexate is hepatotoxic [^1168K4a1], and phentermine has been associated with liver enzyme elevations; monitor liver function tests when combining them.

---

## Clinical evidence and case reports

There are **no published case reports or clinical studies** documenting a significant interaction between phentermine and methotrexate. Available data suggest no clinically meaningful pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction.

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

There are **no specific guidelines** addressing coadministration of phentermine and methotrexate. General principles include:

- **Monitor liver function**: Baseline and periodic LFTs for both drugs.

- **Monitor blood pressure**: Phentermine can increase blood pressure; monitor regularly [^1134BcuM].

- **Routine methotrexate monitoring**: CBC, LFTs, and renal function per standard practice [^1154F81C].

---

## Clinical implications and patient management

When coadministering phentermine and methotrexate:

- **Baseline assessment**: Obtain baseline LFTs, CBC, and renal function tests.

- **Regular monitoring**: Periodic LFTs, CBC, and renal function tests during therapy.

- **Patient education**: Inform patients about signs of hepatotoxicity (jaundice, dark urine, fatigue, abdominal pain).

- **Dose adjustments**: Adjust methotrexate dose based on lab results and clinical response.

- **Contraindications**: Avoid phentermine in patients with uncontrolled hypertension, cardiovascular disease, or glaucoma [^115ob9JX].

---

## Summary of interaction risk

| **Interaction parameter** | **Risk level** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|-|
| Pharmacokinetic interaction | Low | No significant interaction identified |
| Pharmacodynamic interaction | Moderate | Additive hepatotoxicity possible |
| Clinical evidence | Low | No documented cases or studies |
| Clinical guidelines | Low | No specific recommendations |

---

Phentermine and methotrexate do not have a **clinically significant interaction**, but monitor for additive hepatotoxicity. Use standard monitoring protocols and adjust therapy based on lab results and clinical response.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

Refer to the full prescribing information for drug interactions with methotrexate. (7)

7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on Methotrexate

Drugs that Increase Methotrexate Exposure

Coadministration of methotrexate with the following products may increase methotrexate plasma concentrations, which may increase the risk of methotrexate severe adverse reactions. In some cases, the coadministration of methotrexate with these products may also subsequently reduce active metabolite formation, which may decrease the clinical effectiveness of methotrexate.

Increased organ specific adverse reactions may also occur when methotrexate is coadministered with hepatotoxic or nephrotoxic products.

If coadministration cannot be avoided, monitor closely for methotrexate adverse reactions when coadministered with:

Oral antibiotics (including neomycin)
Oral or intravenous penicillin or sulphonamide antibiotics
Antifolate drugs (e.g., dapsone, pemetrexed, pyrimethamine and sulphonamides)
Aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
Hepatotoxic products
Highly protein-bound drugs (e.g., oral anticoagulants, phenytoin, salicylates, sulfonamides, sulfonylureas, and tetracyclines)
Proton pump inhibitors
Weak acids (e.g., salicylates)
Probenecid
Nephrotoxic products

Nitrous Oxide

Coadministration of methotrexate with nitrous oxide anesthesia potentiates the effect of methotrexate on folate-dependent metabolic pathways, which may increase the risk of severe methotrexate adverse reactions. Avoid nitrous oxide anesthesia in patients receiving methotrexate. Consider alternative therapies in patients who have received prior nitrous oxide anesthesia.

Folic Acid

Coadministration of methotrexate with folic acid or its derivatives decreases the clinical effectiveness of methotrexate in patients with neoplastic diseases. Methotrexate competes with reduced folates for active transport across cell membranes. Instruct patients to take folic or folinic acid only as directed by their healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)].

Methotrexate monitoring and interacting medications — baseline/ongoing monitoring includes history and physical examination, hepatitis B and C (baseline monitoring), pretreatment test for latent TB (PPD, T-Spot, or QuantiFERON Gold), and referral for a chest radiograph for a positive TB test. Monitor CBC and LFT every 3–6 months assuming no abnormal laboratory results, with additional monitoring recommended for patients with impaired kidney function including blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels and to check CBC 5 to 7 days after a test-dose. Medications that may increase the risk of methotrexate toxicity include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (salicylates, naproxen, ibuprofen, indomethacin, phenylbutazone), antibiotics (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole†, sulfonamides, penicillin, minocycline, ciprofloxacin), and others (barbiturates, colchicine, dipyridamole, ethanol, phenytoin, sulfonylureas, furosemide, thiazide diuretics), with †Greater potential for methotrexate toxicity. The text notes that patients on methotrexate should be still monitored for rare, serious lung reactions and that drug-drug interactions, especially involving sulfonamides, can significantly increase the likelihood of methotrexate toxicity. Supplemental information is expert consensus and not part of evidence-based recommendations.

### Interactions between antiepileptic and chemotherapeutic drugs [^115BzqDP]. The Lancet: Neurology (2003). Medium credibility.

Cancer and epilepsy commonly co-occur, and concomitant administration of antiepileptic (AEDS) and chemotherapeutic drugs (CTDs) is necessary in many cases. Many drugs are metabolised by the hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzyme system, and coadministration of AEDs and CTDs can lead to clinically relevant interactions by induction or inhibition of enzymes in shared metabolic pathways. These interactions can cause insufficient tumour and seizure control or lead to unforeseen toxicity. Enzyme-inducing AEDs reduce the effects of taxanes, vinca alkaloids, methotrexate, teniposide, and camptothecin analogues. Inhibition of the metabolism of nitrosoureas or etoposide by valproic acid can lead to CTD toxicity. Poor seizure control may result from the combinations of phenytoin with cisplatin or corticosteroids, and valproic acid with methotrexate. Increased toxicity of AEDs can occur when phenytoin is combined with 5-fluorouracil. Use of enzyme-inducing AEDs should be avoided in patients with cancer, particularly in association with chemotherapy. Generally, valproic acid-although not free from interactions-would be the agent of first choice. Some of the newer AEDs not metabolised by the P450 system may prove to be good alternatives.

### Prevalence of potentially harmful multidrug interactions on medication lists of elderly ambulatory patients [^111dNiLR]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Strategies to reduce risk

Once potential MDIs are recognized, providers could substitute one of the interacting drugs with a more benign, non-interacting one. Amiodarone could be replaced with propafenone which would eliminate the amplified risk of hemorrhage resulting from the warfarin-aspirin interaction. The FDA and the American Geriatrics Society 2019 updated the AGS Beers Criteria® for Potentially Inappropriate Medication Use in Older Adults recommend that amiodarone should not be a first-line choice. Ondansetron, which prolongs the QT, could be avoided in patients already on medications that prolong the QT if prescribed anti-emetics that are not associated with changes in the QT interval. Tramadol, which acts as both an opiate and inhibitor of neurotransmitter uptake, exposes patients to multiple serious ADEs. Non-opiate analgesics could be substituted for tramadol and, if there was no indication for the psychotropic effect, no additional medication would be necessary. Substitution of methotrexate, an immunosuppressant prescribed for patients with various autoimmune diseases, would be difficult to replace given its unique role in treating patients with autoimmune diseases. Other strategies would have to be employed such as meticulous attention to those medications which interact with methotrexate to increase the risk of renal or hepatic injury.

Study Highlights

WHAT IS THE CURRENT KNOWLEDGE ON THE TOPIC?

FDA clinical guidelines indicate that sponsors should assess the DDI potential of new chemical entities with concomitant medications before their administration to patients if there is an interaction risk. Sulfasalazine is a proposed probe substrate to investigate intestinal breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) inhibition in vivo.
WHAT QUESTION DID THIS STUDY ADDRESS?

We investigated whether in vitro results indicating strong BCRP inhibition by GLPG3970, a small‐molecule SIK2/3 inhibitor, are also observed in vivo. GLPG3970 could be used in trials in patients with inflammatory disease who concomitantly use sulfasalazine and/or methotrexate, both of which are BCRP substrates.
WHAT DOES THIS STUDY ADD TO OUR KNOWLEDGE?

GLPG3970 showed a mild inhibition of BCRP in vivo (sulfasalazine exposure increased less than twofold upon GLPG3970 coadministration) despite the strong in vitro effect. Methotrexate exposure was unchanged upon GLPG3970 coadministration. Conducting a DDI study with SSZ presents practical challenges that are highlighted herein.
HOW MIGHT THIS CHANGE CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY OR TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE?

### Accumulating evidence for a drug-drug interaction between methotrexate and proton pump inhibitors [^112kRP3z]. The Oncologist (2012). Low credibility.

Background

A number of medications are known to interact with methotrexate through various mechanisms. The aim of this article is to apprise practitioners of a new labeling change based on the accumulating evidence for a possible drug-drug interaction between methotrexate (primarily at high doses) and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs).

Methods

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) database of spontaneous adverse event reports and the published literature were searched for cases reporting an interaction between methotrexate and PPIs.

Results

A search of the AERS database and existing literature found several individual case reports of drug-drug interactions and three additional supportive studies that suggest potential underlying mechanisms for the interaction.

Conclusion

There is evidence to suggest that concomitant use of methotrexate (primarily at high doses) with PPIs such as omeprazole, esomeprazole, and pantoprazole may decrease methotrexate clearance, leading to elevated serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite hydroxymethotrexate, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities. In several case reports, no methotrexate toxicity was found when a histamine H2 blocker was substituted for a PPI. Based on the reviewed data, the FDA updated the methotrexate label to include the possible drug-drug interaction between high-dose methotrexate and PPIs. Physicians should be alerted to this potential drug-drug interaction in patients receiving concomitant high-dose methotrexate and PPIs.

### Guidelines of care for the management of acne vulgaris [^116mhjuE]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Amoxicillin — prescribing information for acne states the indication as adjunctive treatment in acne, especially during pregnancy, with pediatric and adult dosing, contraindications, adverse effects, interactions, and special population notes. Children with mild to moderate skin infections: > 3 months and < 40 kg, 25 mg/kg/day orally every 12 hours OR 20 mg/kg/day every 8 hours; > 3 months and > 40 kg 500 mg orally every 12 hours or 250 mg orally every 8 hours. Adults: 250 mg twice a day up to 500 mg 3 times a day. Contraindications include known hypersensitivity to penicillins, including serious hypersensitivity reactions, such as anaphylaxis and Stevens — Johnson syndrome to penicillins and cephalosporins. Adverse effects/toxicities include skin reactions (acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, erythematous maculopapular rash, urticaria, erythema multiforme, Stevens — Johnson syndrome, or toxic epidermal necrolysis), gastrointestinal effects (diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting), neurologic effects (headache, agitation, anxiety, behavior changes, dizziness, insomnia, or seizure), immunologic effects (anaphylaxis, hypersensitivity reaction, or serum sickness), blood disorders (agranulocytosis, anemia, eosinophilia, hemolytic anemia, leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, or thrombocytopenia purpura), and hepatic effects (cholestatic hepatitis, cholestatic jaundice, hepatitis, or increased aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase). Interactions are listed with venlafaxine, methotrexate, tetracyclines, warfarin, bupropion and other agents lowering seizure threshold, probenecid, acenocoumarol, khat, phenindione, piperine, dicumarol, phenprocoumon, and allopurinol. Other issues note renal dosing adjustment required and baseline monitoring none; the pregnancy category is B, nursing is minimal risk to infant, compatible with breastfeeding, and pediatric use indicates safety and efficacy established.

### Drug-drug interaction between methotrexate and levetiracetam resulting in delayed methotrexate elimination [^111ucDiz]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of delayed methotrexate (MTX) elimination while receiving concomitant levetiracetam.

Case Report

A 46-year-old man with relapsed osteosarcoma of the base of the skull receiving high-dose MTX tolerated his first cycle of MTX with elimination to nontoxic MTX levels (≤ 0.1 µmol/L) within 90 hours. After hospital discharge, the patient experienced seizures secondary to brain metastasis and started on levetiracetam, which was continued as maintenance therapy. The patient experienced delayed MTX elimination during cycles 2, 3, and 4 while receiving levetiracetam. On average, elimination to nontoxic MTX levels took 130 hours (106–144 hours). Before the fifth cycle of MTX, lorazepam was substituted for the levetiracetam. MTX was eliminated to nontoxic levels within 95 hours. During all cycles, the patient received standard supportive care and serum creatinine remained stable. No other drugs known to interact with MTX were administered.

Discussion

This possible drug interaction has only been reported once in the pediatric population. With a score of 6 on the Drug Interaction Probability Scale for evaluating causation of drug interactions, it is probable that the delayed MTX elimination was caused by an interaction with levetiracetam.

Conclusion

Coadministration of levetiracetam and MTX may result in delayed elimination of MTX, increasing the likelihood of toxicity. Consideration should be given to temporarily switching from levetiracetam to another antiepileptic (ie, lorazepam) to prevent this interaction. This is particularly important in those experiencing delayed elimination with prior cycles of concomitant MTX and levetiracetam or those at greater risk for MTX toxicity.

### Guidelines of care for the management of acne vulgaris [^111fwvQx]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Trimethoprim — prescribing information for acne management notes that it is "Not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of acne, use is off-label". Contraindications include "Known hypersensitivity to trimethoprim, documented megaloblastic anemia caused by folate deficiency". Adverse effects/toxicities listed include "Dermatologic: rash, pruritus, or phototoxic skin eruptions" and "Hypersensitivity: exfoliative dermatitis, erythema multiforme, Stevens — Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis (Lyell syndrome), or anaphylaxis", as well as "Gastrointestinal: epigastric distress, nausea, vomiting, glossitis, elevation of serum transaminase and bilirubin, or cholestatic jaundice", "Hematologic: thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, neutropenia, megaloblastic anemia, or methemoglobinemia", "Metabolic: hyperkalemia, hyponatremia", "Neurologic: aseptic meningitis", and "Miscellaneous: fever, increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine levels". Interactions include "Dapsone, phenytoin, tests for creatinine, test for methotrexate". "Use as monotherapy should be avoided". Pregnancy guidance states "C, trimethoprim may interfere with folic acid metabolism, use during pregnancy only if potential benefits justify risk to fetus". For nursing, it is "Distributed into milk. Because trimethoprim may interfere with folic acid metabolism, use caution in nursing women", and pediatric use notes "Safety and efficacy not established, use with caution in children with fragile X chromosome".

### Ketotolac tromethamine [^111ozRAm]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

Methotrexate

NSAIDs have been reported to competitively inhibit methotrexate
accumulation in rabbit kidney slices. This may indicate that they could enhance
the toxicity of methotrexate. Caution should be used when NSAIDs are
administered concomitantly with methotrexate.

ACE Inhibitors/Angiotension II Receptor
Antagonists

Concomitant use of ACE
inhibitors and/or angiotension II receptor antagonists may
increase the risk of renal impairment, particularly in volume-depleted patients.

Reports suggest that NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of ACE
inhibitors and/or angiotension II receptor antagonists. This interaction should
be given consideration in patients taking NSAIDs concomitantly with ACE
inhibitors and/or angiotension II receptor antagonists.

Antiepileptic Drugs

Sporadic cases of seizures have been reported during concomitant
use of ketorolac tromethamine and antiepileptic drugs (phenytoin,
carbamazepine).

Psychoactive Drugs

Hallucinations have been reported when ketorolac tromethamine was
used in patients taking psychoactive drugs (fluoxetine, thiothixene, alprazolam).

Pentoxifylline

When ketorolac tromethamine is administered concurrently with
pentoxifylline, there is an increased tendency to bleeding.

Nondepolarizing Muscle Relaxants

In post-marketing experience there have been reports of a
possible interaction between ketorolac tromethamine IV/IM and nondepolarizing muscle relaxants that resulted in apnea. The concurrent use of ketorolac
tromethamine with muscle relaxants has not been formally studied.

Acitretin — drug interactions and cautions: Etretinate can be formed with concurrent ingestion of acitretin and ethanol. Acitretin might interact with glucose-lowering effect of glibenclamide and may interfere with the contraceptive effect of microdosed progestin preparation. Acitretin and methotrexate can both cause hepatotoxicity; therefore, they should be combined with caution, and acitretin may reduce the protein binding of phenytoin. Acitretin and tetracyclines can both increase intracranial pressure; their combined use should be avoided, and concomitant administration of vitamin A and other oral retinoids with acitretin should be avoided.

### Adverse drug interactions involving common prescription and over-the-counter analgesic agents [^116r6naF]. Clinical Therapeutics (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Eight analgesic preparations with approved indications for acute pain were among the top 200 drugs prescribed in the United States in 2006. In addition, an estimated 36 million Americans use over-the-counter (OTC) analgesics daily. Given this volume of use, it is not surprising that a number of drug interactions involving analgesic drugs have been reported.

Objectives

This article examines the pharmacologic factors that enhance the clinical relevance of potential drug interactions and reviews the literature on drug interactions involving the most commonly used analgesic preparations in the United States.

Methods

A PubMed search was conducted for English-language articles published between January 1967 and July 2007. Among the search terms were drug interactions, acetaminophen, aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, celecoxib, NSAIDs, hydrocodone, oxycodone, codeine, tramadol, OTC analgesics, alcohol, ethanol, antihypertensive drugs, methotrexate, warfarin, SSRIs, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline, citalopram, serotonin syndrome, MAOIs, and overdose. Controlled clinical trials, case-control studies, and case reports were included in the review.

Results

A number of case reports and well-controlled clinical trials were identified that provided evidence of the relatively well known drug-drug interactions between prescription/OTC NSAIDs and alcohol, antihypertensive drugs, high-dose methotrexate, and lithium, as well as between frequently prescribed narcotics and other central nervous system depressants. In contrast, the ability of recent alcohol ingestion to exacerbate the hepatotoxic potential of therapeutic doses of acetaminophen is not supported by either case reports or clinical research. Use of ibuprofen according to OTC guidelines in patients taking cardioprotective doses of aspirin does not appear to interfere with aspirin's antiplatelet activity, whereas chronic prescription use of ibuprofen and other NSAIDs may interfere. Low-dose aspirin intake appears to abolish the gastroprotective effects of cyclooxygenase-2-selective inhibitors, including celecoxib. There is evidence of other less well known and potentially clinically significant drug-drug interactions, including the ability of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors to inhibit the analgesic activity of tramadol and codeine through inhibition of their metabolic activation, to induce serotonin syndrome when used chronically in the presence of high doses of tramadol through synergistic serotonergic action, and to increase the potential for gastrointestinal bleeding associated with NSAID therapy through additive or supra-additive antiplatelet activity.

Conclusions

Considering the widespread use of analgesic agents, the overall incidence of serious drug-drug interactions involving these agents has been relatively low. The most serious interactions usually involved other interacting drugs with low therapeutic indices or chronic and/or high-dose use of an analgesic and the interacting drug.

### The genetic architecture of protein interaction affinity and specificity [^114XBAJu]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Determining general, family-wide rules requires broader approaches where the effects of sequence variation are quantified not only on binding to one or a few known interaction partners but to all family members. We previously developed protein fragment complementation (PCA)-based deep mutational scanning assays to quantify the effects of thousands of variants of two interacting proteins (Fig. 1b). These assays, which we collectively term deepPCA, are based on a split DHFR system whereby the proteins of interest are fused to complementary fragments of a murine DHFR variant (respectively called DH and FR) that confers resistance to methotrexate. When the two proteins interact, the two fragments complement each other and the reconstituted DHFR activity sustains yeast growth in the presence of methotrexate, an inhibitor of the endogenous yeast DHFR. These assays are highly quantitative and have a large dynamic range –. In one deepPCA implementation, BindingPCA (bPCA), two proteins are expressed as DH and FR fusions from the same plasmid, enabling library-on-library screening in a single pool format (Fig. 1b, left). Yeast cells expressing pairs of proteins (wild-type or mutant) that form stronger interactions are enriched in the population while those forming weaker interactions are depleted. Deep sequencing then allows variants to be identified and the frequency of each variant or variant pair before and after growth in methotrexate to be quantified. The resulting enrichment scores are proportional to dimer concentration within the dynamic range of the assay and can be used to infer the underlying causal changes in binding free energy by fitting thermodynamic models to this data. bPCA thus provides a very high-throughput method to perform biophysical measurements –.

Safety

A summary of TEAEs in the SSZ/GLPG3970 and MTX/GLPG3970 DDI studies is given in Table S3. In the MTX/GLPG3970 DDI study, there was one TEAE of an upper respiratory tract infection that led to discontinuation of study treatment; the TEAE was determined by the investigator as not related to the study drug. Overall, GLPG3970 350 mg demonstrated an acceptable safety profile and was well tolerated both when administered alone and when coadministered with SSZ or MTX.

### Methotrexate elimination when coadministered with levetiracetam [^112hYYr2]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Delayed elimination of methotrexate was previously reported in 2 patients receiving concomitant levetiracetam.

Objective

To explore the potential interaction between methotrexate and levetiracetam in patients receiving high-dose methotrexate.

Methods

This retrospective study reviewed the records of 81 adults receiving 280 cycles of methotrexate to determine the effects of levetiracetam on methotrexate elimination. Institutional review board approval was obtained.

Results

Levetiracetam was administered in 33 (12%) cycles of methotrexate. Patients receiving levetiracetam had significantly lower 24-hour methotrexate concentrations compared with those not receiving levetiracetam (2.91 vs 7.37 µmol/L, P = 0.005). Despite this difference, concentrations at 48 and 72 hours were similar between groups. Times to nontoxic methotrexate concentration (< 0.1 µmol/L) were the same regardless of the presence of levetiracetam. The frequency of delayed elimination at 24, 48, and 72 hours was similar in both groups as was the frequency of delayed elimination at any time point. Cox regression demonstrated that levetiracetam was not a significant predictor of time to nontoxic methotrexate concentration (P = 0.796; HR = 1.058; 95% CI = 0.692–1.617), and logistic regression demonstrated that levetiracetam was not a significant predictor of delayed elimination at any time point. Levetiracetam use was similar between groups when comparing patients experiencing delayed elimination at any time point with those without delayed elimination (13% vs 10%, respectively, P = 0.527).

Conclusion

This study does not support the previous reports of a significant interaction between levetiracetam and methotrexate. A clinically significant interaction is unlikely in those without additional risk factors for delayed elimination.

### Effects of GLPG3970 on sulfasalazine and methotrexate pharmacokinetics in healthy adults: two open-label, phase I, drug-drug interaction studies [^115KyUZD]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) is an efflux transporter that restricts the distribution of its substrates into organs by limiting their intestinal absorption. It is included in the list of important drug transporters that both the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) consider necessary to investigate regarding interactions with new chemical entities. In vitro assays suggest that GLPG3970 is an inhibitor of BCRP (unpublished data). Based on the observed in vitro half maximal inhibitory concentration of GLPG3970 for BCRP, and the anticipated in vivo maximum observed free plasma concentration (C max) at steady state at the highest anticipated therapeutic dose of GLPG3970, there is a potential risk of interaction between GLPG3970 and BCRP substrates.

Sulfasalazine (SSZ) and methotrexate (MTX) are common background therapies for rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease, and both are substrates of BCRP.SSZ has been proposed as a clinical probe for intestinal BCRP inhibition given that SSZ is restricted largely to the gastrointestinal tract owing to its low gastrointestinal permeability and low solubility, and efficient intestinal BCRP efflux.SSZ is poorly absorbed following oral administration (< 15%) and systemic concentrations are detectable at ~ 1.5 hours post‐dosing, with the t max reached at 3–12 hours post‐dosing.

### Effects of GLPG3970 on sulfasalazine and methotrexate pharmacokinetics in healthy adults: two open-label, phase I, drug-drug interaction studies [^116wsfHt]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

In the SSZ/GLPG3970 DDI study, participants received a single dose of SSZ in the morning on day 1 (treatment period 1). On the morning of day 5, participants received a single dose of GLPG3970 immediately before SSZ, and on the morning of day 9, participants received a single dose of GLPG3970 2 hours post‐SSZ. As preliminary work demonstrated that food consumption reduced the C max of GLPG3970, all doses were administered after an overnight fast of at least 10 hours. In addition, participants had to remain fasted for at least 4 hours post‐SSZ dosing on day 1, day 5, and day 9. In the MTX/GLPG3970 DDI study, participants received a single dose of MTX in the morning on day 1 (treatment period 1) and day 5 (treatment period 2), after an overnight fast of at least 10 hours to maximize GLPG3970 exposure. On day 1, participants had to remain fasted for at least 4 hours post‐MTX dosing. On day 5, participants received a single dose of GLPG3970 immediately before MTX and then remained fasted for at least 4 hours. On days 6–8, participants had to be fasted for at least 2 hours in the morning before receiving GLPG3970 and were then allowed breakfast 1 hour post‐GLPG3970 dosing.

In the SSZ/GLPG3970 DDI study, blood samples were collected for PK analyses of SSZ and SPD before each SSZ dosing and at regular intervals up to 72 hours after each SSZ dosing. For PK analyses of GLPG3970, blood samples were collected before GLPG3970 dosing and at intervals up to 24 hours post‐dosing on days 5 and 9 when GLPG3970 was coadministered with SSZ. In the MTX/GLPG3970 DDI study, blood samples were collected for PK analyses of MTX and 7‐OH‐MTX before MTX dosing and at regular intervals up to 96 hours post‐MTX dosing on days 1 and 5. For PK analyses of GLPG3970, blood samples were collected before GLPG3970 administration on all GLPG3970 dosing days, and at regular intervals up to 24 hours post‐dosing on day 5.

5.11 Interaction with St. John's wort or Rifampin

Drugs which induce CYP2C19 or CYP3A4 (such as St. John's wort or rifampin) can substantially decrease omeprazole concentrations [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Avoid concomitant use of ZEGERID with St. John's wort or rifampin.

5.12 Interactions with Investigations for Neuroendocrine Tumors

Serum chromogranin A (CgA) levels increase secondary to drug-induced decreases in gastric acidity. The increased CgA level may cause false positive results in diagnostic investigations for neuroendocrine tumors. Providers should temporarily stop ZEGERID treatment for at least 14 days before assessing CgA levels and consider repeating the test if initial CgA levels are high. If serial tests are performed (e.g., for monitoring), the same commercial laboratory should be used for testing, as reference ranges between tests may vary [see Drug Interactions (7)].

5.13 Interaction with Methotrexate

Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities. In high-dose methotrexate administration, a temporary withdrawal of the PPI may be considered in some patients [see Drug Interactions (7)].

5.14 Fundic Gland Polyps

PPI use is associated with an increased risk of fundic gland polyps that increases with long-term use, especially beyond one year. Most PPIs users who developed fundic gland polyps were asymptomatic and fundic gland polyps were identified incidentally on endoscopy. Use the shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated.

Drug Interaction Studies

Effect of Lansoprazole on Other Drugs

Cytochrome P450 Interactions

Lansoprazole is metabolized through the cytochrome P450 system, specifically through the CYP3A and CYP2C19 isozymes. Studies have shown that lansoprazole does not have clinically significant interactions with other drugs metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system, such as warfarin, antipyrine, indomethacin, ibuprofen, phenytoin, propranolol, prednisone, diazepam, or clarithromycin in healthy subjects. These compounds are metabolized through various cytochrome P450 isozymes including CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A.

Theophylline

When lansoprazole was administered concomitantly with theophylline (CYP1A2, CYP3A), a minor increase (10%) in the clearance of theophylline was seen. Because of the small magnitude and the direction of the effect on theophylline clearance, this interaction is unlikely to be of clinical concern (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions).

Methotrexate and 7-hydroxymethotrexate

In an open-label, single-arm, eight day, pharmacokinetic study of 28 adult rheumatoid arthritis patients (who required the chronic use of 7.5 to 15 mg of methotrexate given weekly), administration of seven days of naproxen 500 mg twice daily and lansoprazole 30 mg daily had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of methotrexate and 7-hydroxymethotrexate. While this study was not designed to assess the safety of this combination of drugs, no major adverse reactions were noted. However, this study was conducted with low doses of methotrexate. A drug interaction study with high doses of methotrexate has not been conducted (see WARNINGS).

### Endogenous metabolites-mediated communication between OAT1 / OAT3 and OATP1B1 may explain the association between SLCO1B1 SNPs and methotrexate toxicity [^116Rs3on]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

Although OATP1B1 is not expressed in the kidney, polymorphisms in SLCO1B1 have been associated with methotrexate clearance or toxicity. This unexpected pharmacogenetic association may reflect remote communication between liver and kidney transporters. This study confirms the pharmacogenetic association with methotrexate toxicity in adult patients with hematological malignancies. Using a targeted urinary metabolomics approach, we identified 38 and 34 metabolites which were differentially excreted between wildtype and carriers of the c.388A > G or c.521T > C variant alleles, respectively, half of them being associated with methotrexate toxicity. These metabolites mainly consisted of fatty acid derivatives and microbiota catabolites, including glycine conjugates and other uremic toxins, all known OATs substrates. These results suggest that dysfunction of a transporter affects the excretion profile of endogenous or exogenous substrates, possibly through metabolite-mediated interactions involving other transport systems, even in distant organs. This opens the way for better comprehension of complex pharmacokinetics and transporter-mediated drug-drug or nutrient-drug interactions.

Methotrexate — drug interactions and hepatotoxic co-medications: Numerous medications may interact with methotrexate by a variety of mechanisms that can result in elevated drug levels, thereby increasing the risk for methotrexate toxicity; after absorption, methotrexate binds to serum albumin. Salicylates, sulfonamides, diphenylhydantoin, and antibiotics including penicillin, minocycline, chloramphenicol, and trimethoprim may decrease the binding of methotrexate to albumin leading to increased serum levels, and several other medications including colchicine, CSA, probenecid, salicylates, and sulfonamides may lead to decreased renal tubular excretion with increased serum levels. Given the hepatotoxicity of methotrexate, caution should be used when prescribing this drug to patients taking other potentially hepatotoxic agents including alcohol, statins, leflunomide, retinoids, azathioprine, and minocycline; although some nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may elevate serum methotrexate levels (e.g., ibuprofen, salicylates, naproxen), other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ketoprofen, flurbiprofen, piroxicam, meloxicam, lumiracoxib, rofecoxib, and celecoxib do not. Table V identifies medication classes and examples that may increase methotrexate toxicity.

### Interaction between low-dose methotrexate and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, penicillins, and proton pump inhibitors [^115pZd5m]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the potential drug interactions between low-dose methotrexate (LD-MTX) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), penicillins, and proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) given the disparity between interactions reported for high-dose and low-dose MTX to help guide clinicians.

Data Sources

A literature search was performed in MEDLINE (1946 to September 2016), EMBASE (1974 to September 2016), and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970 to January 2015) to identify reports describing potential drug interactions between LD-MTX and NSAIDS, penicillins, or PPIs. Reference lists of included articles were reviewed to find additional eligible articles.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All English-language observational, randomized, and pharmacokinetic (PK) studies assessing LD-MTX interactions in humans were analyzed to determine clinical relevance in making recommendations to clinicians. Clinical case reports were assigned a Drug Interaction Probability Scale score.

Data Synthesis

A total of 32 articles were included (28 with NSAIDs, 3 with penicillins, and 2 with PPIs [1 including both PPI and NSAID]). Although there are some PK data to describe increased LD-MTX concentrations when NSAIDs are used concomitantly, the clinical relevance remains unclear. Based on the limited data on LD-MTX with penicillins and PPIs, no clinically meaningful interaction was identified.

Conclusion

Given the available evidence, the clinical importance of the interaction between LD-MTX and NSAIDs, penicillins, and PPIs cannot be substantiated. Health care providers should assess the benefit and risk of LD-MTX regardless of concomitant drug use, including factors known to predispose patients to MTX toxicity, and continue to monitor clinical and laboratory parameters per guideline recommendations.

If serial tests are performed (e.g., for monitoring), the same commercial laboratory should be used for testing, as reference ranges between tests may vary [see Drug Interactions (7)].

5.13 Interaction with Methotrexate

Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities. In high-dose methotrexate administration, a temporary withdrawal of the PPI may be considered in some patients [see Drug Interactions (7)].

5.14 Fundic Gland Polyps

PPI use is associated with an increased risk of fundic gland polyps that increases with long-term use, especially beyond one year. Most PPIs users who developed fundic gland polyps were asymptomatic and fundic gland polyps were identified incidentally on endoscopy. Use the shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the initial evaluation and management of patients presenting to the emergency department in early pregnancy [^111YHbSp]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Methotrexate in ectopic pregnancy — The emergency physician must be aware of potential side effects, complications, and drug interactions of methotrexate; methotrexate is a cytotoxic agent that acts by inhibiting dihydrofolate reductase and is a potent folate antagonist that blocks DNA synthesis before cell division; rapidly dividing cells, such as trophoblastic tissue, are unable to divide and replicate, and bone marrow suppression and gastrointestinal toxicity are possible with complications including stomatitis, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal cramping; hepatotoxicity has been shown after prolonged methotrexate use and is not relevant in the short-term dosing used for ectopic pregnancy; patients may experience acute pulmonary symptoms such as cough, dyspnea, and chest pain that usually resolve with discontinuation of methotrexate and rarely occur with brief use; several drugs need to be carefully monitored during methotrexate use.

### Risk-benefit assessment of methotrexate in the treatment of severe psoriasis [^112QeWy1]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Methotrexate is an established and highly effective systemic treatment for severe psoriasis, including the pustular and erythrodermic forms. It has been widely used during the last 3 decades. For this reason, the long term adverse effects of methotrexate are well known, in contrast to other relatively new systemic treatments like cyclosporin and retinoids. The most frequent adverse effects occurring during methotrexate therapy are abnormal liver function tests, nausea and gastric complaints. The most feared adverse effects are myelosuppression and hepatotoxicity. Because hepatotoxicity is related to a high cumulative dose of methotrexate, rotational therapy or an intermittent instead of a continuous treatment schedule are advised. The histological assessment of liver biopsies, according to the international guidelines, remains the gold standard for detection of liver damage until equally reliable noninvasive screening methods for liver damage — tentatively dynamic hepatic scintigraphy (DHS) or measurement of levels of serum aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen — are well evaluated. Low dose methotrexate therapy is relatively well tolerated, provided that there is careful patient selection and regular monitoring for adverse effects and drug interactions during methotrexate therapy is carried out. The long term clinical efficacy and relative safety of methotrexate remain impressive.

### Effects of GLPG3970 on sulfasalazine and methotrexate pharmacokinetics in healthy adults: two open-label, phase I, drug-drug interaction studies [^1172zPNW]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Figure 1
Study designs of (a) SSZ/GLPG3970 and (b) MTX/GLPG3970 DDI studies. AE, adverse event; BCRP, breast cancer resistance protein, DDI, drug–drug interaction; ECG, electrocardiogram; MTX, methotrexate; NAT2, N‐acetyltransferase 2; PK, pharmacokinetic; SSZ, sulfasalazine.

Participants received SSZ 1,000 mg and MTX 7.5 mg as oral tablets in the respective studies. The chosen doses were low and within the therapeutic ranges used in the treatment of inflammatory diseases (SSZ 500–4,000 mg and MTX 7.5–30 mg), to provide an acceptable safety margin in the event of increased exposures in the presence of GLPG3970. The dose regimen selected for the DDI assessments in these studies was GLPG3970 350 mg once daily. This dose was selected based on the results of the first‐in‐human study, in which the safety profile and tolerability were established for a range of doses (doses of 10–500 mg), and was anticipated to be within the therapeutic dose range. GLPG3970 350 mg was administered once daily as an oral solution in both studies.

### Methotrexate in dermatology [^113Yn8JB]. Dermatologic Therapy (2007). Low credibility.

Methotrexate is a folic acid analog pioneered for use in inflammatory diseases by dermatologists, and used successfully for over 40 years for a wide variety of cutaneous diseases. In addition to its antiproliferative properties, methotrexate has other more recently recognized anti-inflammatory properties related to its effects on adenosine. Further research concerning its mechanism of action and genetic enzymatic variations suggest future possibilities for maximizing therapy and predicting adverse events. In this review the present authors will explore methotrexate's pharmacokinetics, mode of administration, dosing guidelines, side effect profile, and medication interactions. In addition, the present authors hope to offer practical guidelines for dose initiation and adjustment, and to summarize new research on its mechanism of action and implications for future therapy.

### Effects of GLPG3970 on sulfasalazine and methotrexate pharmacokinetics in healthy adults: two open-label, phase I, drug-drug interaction studies [^112f5wyn]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

GLPG3970 is a selective salt-inducible kinase 2/3 inhibitor intended for the treatment of inflammatory diseases. In vitro studies suggest GLPG3970 strongly inhibits breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), indicating a possible interaction with BCRP substrates such as sulfasalazine (SSZ; a probe substrate for intestinal BCRP inhibition) and methotrexate (MTX), both inflammatory disease medications. Two open-label, nonrandomized, phase I, drug-drug interaction (DDI) studies assessed the pharmacokinetics of SSZ 1,000mg (NCT04720183) and MTX 7.5mg (EudraCT: 2020–000391–37) with and without GLPG3970 350mg. Healthy participants aged 18–55years with wild-type homozygous BCRP genotype (c421C/C) received: SSZ on day (D)1, GLPG3970+SSZ on D5, and GLPG3970 2hours after SSZ on D9 (N = 8; SSZ/GLPG3970 DDI study); MTX on D1, GLPG3970+MTX on D5, and GLPG3970 on D6–8 (N = 15; MTX/GLPG3970 DDI study). Primary end points were AUC and C max ("exposure") of SSZ and its metabolite (sulfapyridine [SPD]), SPD:SSZ AUC ratio (SSZ/GLPG3970 study), and AUC and C max ("exposure") of MTX (MTX/GLPG3970 study). DDIs were evaluated using the geometric mean ratio of each end point; a > 2-fold increase in SSZ or MTX exposure was deemed clinically relevant. GLPG3970 demonstrated mild inhibition of intestinal BCRP in vivo: GLPG3970+SSZ increased SSZ exposure ~1.7–1.8-fold and decreased SPD:SSZ ratio~2-fold vs. SSZ alone. GLPG3970 administered 2hours after SSZ did not change the magnitude of the interaction. GLPG3970+MTX had no relevant effect on MTX pharmacokinetics vs. MTX alone. Therefore, the strong in vitro BCRP inhibition was not confirmed in vivo. No safety concerns were observed when GLPG3970 was coadministered with SSZ or MTX.

### The information required by people with inflammatory arthritis when taking methotrexate: a mixed-methods systematic review [^111pJM6P]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Concerns about taking MTX

Reticence was expressed by many about taking MTX. Some were concerned that MTX was not helpful for IA and wanted information about possible risks and long-term harms, possible lifestyle restrictions, such as the need to limit alcohol intake, and alternative treatment options.

Receiving verbal and written information around the time of diagnosis that highlighted the need for care with the timing and dosage of MTX, requirements for safety monitoring blood tests, and possible side effects generated more concerns for some. Others reported a pragmatic approach, balancing concerns about MTX with optimism that the side effects would not affect them. Satisfaction with information about side effects varied, with many seeking reassurance and more information, including the likelihood of experiencing side effects, to support decisions regarding starting MTX. Some remained concerned about side effects, but decided to start MTX and sought more information.

Those with more concerns often used multiple information sources, seeking to resolve concerns and gain reassurance about the necessity to take MTX. Using multiple information sources sometimes resulted in conflicting information that increased concerns, creating a barrier to starting MTX. Others chose not to read 'official' information in a bid to minimize concerns about side effects, whereas others rationalized their concerns, accepting that all drugs have side effects. Information about alternative treatment options was important for those concerned that the risk of side effects outweighed potential benefits of MTX; however, many reported not receiving such information.

Many were concerned about possible adverse effects and implications on lifestyle. Specific concerns included the impact of MTX on sex life, which some felt was not adequately addressed. The risk of experiencing MTX related nausea was undesirable leading to concerns about potential long-term harms resulting from taking MTX. Some identified concerns about the risk of developing side effects when taking multiple medications, and wondered whether MTX was the cause of hair loss. Fears about the possibility of MTX causing drowsiness were not always adequately addressed. Conflicting guidelines about restricting alcohol intake frequently led to anxieties, appeared to increase concerns about the toxicity of MTX, were deemed patronizing, and created a burden of treatment for some. Many wanted information about possible drug interactions, dietary restrictions, or interactions between food and MTX. Practical aspects such as deciding which day of the week to take MTX, organizing MTX supplies, problems opening packaging, managing s.c. MTX injection devices and side effects (such as local injection site reactions), managing associated toxic waste and the importance of safety monitoring also resulted in concerns and difficulties. Illustrative quotes are provided in Table 2.

### Methotrexate and doxycycline interaction: a rare cause of pancytopenia [^114T85Gp]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Methotrexate (MTX) was originally formulated as one of the first antitumour drugs due to its ability to alter folate metabolism, which renders it to be an antiproliferative agent. Classically, the higher dosage is administered via parenteral route, in a cyclical fashion, to achieve antitumour effects. Patients on high doses of MTX are prone to develop rare complications of myelosuppression and pancytopenia, in a dose-dependent fashion, secondary to altered folate metabolism. 1 Herein, we present a unique case of rheumatoid arthritis presented with pancytopenia due to low-dose MTX and doxycycline drug interaction. We also report the successful management of pancytopenia and oral ulcers with combination therapy of leucovorin and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor.

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia supportive care — high‑dose methotrexate (MTX) management specifies that trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole may be held during high‑dose MTX and restarted after MTX clearance, and that if delayed elimination due to renal impairment occurs, glucarpidase is strongly recommended when plasma MTX concentrations are two standard deviations above expected (MTXPK.org) or when plasma MTX levels are > 30 μM at 36 hours, > 10 μM at 42 hours, or > 5 μM at 48 hours; optimal administration is within 48 to 60 hours from the start of methotrexate infusion, and leucovorin should be continued for at least 2 days and given at least 2 hours before or 2 hours after glucarpidase. There may be important drug interactions between proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and methotrexate that need to be considered prior to initiation of methotrexate‑based therapy. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on pharmacological interventions for adults with obesity [^1129Qbqc]. Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

AGA obesity pharmacotherapy — phentermine evidence and recommendation — Using the evidence-to-decision framework, the panel assessed phentermine's desirable and undesirable effects in individuals with BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 or ≥ 27 kg/m2 and weight-related complications, noting trials were only 3–6 months and data on long-term monotherapy are lacking, hence the low certainty of evidence for the recommendation. The desirable effect was thought to be of moderate magnitude, while the cumulative treatment discontinuation rate due to adverse events was much higher in the phentermine group compared with control, mainly because of significant central nervous system (CNS) effects; however, SAEs were rare. Altogether, the panel judged that undesirable effects were frequent but not serious and that the balance between the desirable and undesirable effects would probably favor the use of phentermine; therefore, the panel made a conditional recommendation on the use of phentermine for individuals with obesity or overweight with weight-related complications. The guideline also notes that phentermine at 7.5–15 mg is approved for long-term use when combined with topiramate in the FDA-approved ER combination.

Phentermine/Topamax (Qsymia) protocol — use caution is advised with cardiovascular disease, psychiatric agitation, specific comorbidities, and interacting drugs, and includes additional safety notes. Use caution with history of coronary artery disease, arrhythmia, including family history of arrhythmia, stroke, congestive heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension and with agitated state, like mania. High blood pressure warrants obtain cardiac echo to assess for baseline end-organ damage and ensure adequate control of blood pressure before starting phentermine, and congenital heart disease warrants obtain cardiology consultation before starting phentermine. Concomitant use of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors with topiramate may increase the risk of metabolic acidosis, and use of SSRIs and SNRIs may increase risk of serotonin syndrome. Use of insulin — with weight loss, dose of insulin may need to be decreased to avoid hypoglycemia, and caution is noted for renal impairment, metabolic acidosis, history of kidney stones, and depression or suicidal ideation; for patients at high risk for pregnancy, do not start Phentermine/Topiramate ER.

### Lansoprazole [^115kRfZB]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Theophylline:

When lansoprazole was administered concomitantly with theophylline (CYP1A2, CYP3A), a minor increase (10%) in the clearance of theophylline was seen. Because of the small magnitude and the direction of the effect on theophylline clearance, this interaction is unlikely to be of clinical concern [see Drug Interactions (7)]

Methotrexate and 7-hydromethotrexate:

In an open-label, single-arm, eight-day, pharmacokinetic study of 28 adult rheumatoid arthritis patients (who required the chronic use of 7.5 to 15 mg of methotrexate given weekly), administration of seven days of naproxen 500 mg twice daily and lansoprazole 30 mg daily had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of methotrexate and 7-hydroxymethotrexate. While this study was not designed to assess the safety of this combination of drugs, no major adverse reactions were noted. However, this study was conducted with low doses of methotrexate. A drug interaction study with high doses of methotrexate has not been conducted [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)].

Amoxicillin:

Lansoprazole has also been shown to have no clinically significant interaction with amoxicillin.

Sucralfate:

In a single-dose crossover study examining lansoprazole 30 mg and omeprazole 20 mg each administered alone and concomitantly with sucralfate 1 gram, absorption of the proton pump inhibitors was delayed and their bioavailability was reduced by 17% and 16%, respectively, when administered concomitantly with sucralfate. Therefore, proton pump inhibitors should be taken at least 30 minutes prior to sucralfate [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Drug Interactions (7)].

Pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia — methotrexate (MTX) toxicity management includes drug–interaction cautions and criteria for glucarpidase with leucovorin support: Caution use of medications that compete for excretion and nephrotoxic medications with MTX due to potential effect on clearance. In high‑dose MTX with delayed elimination due to renal impairment, glucarpidase is strongly recommended when plasma MTX concentrations are two standard deviations above the mean expected MTX plasma concentration as determined by MTXPK.org, or if the 36‑hour plasma MTX level is above 30 µM, 42‑hour level is above 10 µM, or 48‑hour level is above 5 µM; optimal administration is within 48 to 60 hours from the start of MTX infusion. Leucovorin should be dosed based on pre‑glucarpidase plasma MTX concentration, should be continued for at least 2 days following glucarpidase, and should not be administered within 2 hours prior to or following glucarpidase; doses of leucovorin > 25 mg should be given IV due to saturable absorption when given orally. After glucarpidase, standard immunoassay methods may overestimate the true MTX concentration because they do not distinguish MTX from its metabolites. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the initial evaluation and management of patients presenting to the emergency department in early pregnancy [^113bD9kp]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Ectopic pregnancy — methotrexate use parameters and administration options include that the ACOG 1998 Practice Bulletin recommended methotrexate be used only in patients with an hCG level between 6,000 and 15,000 mIU/mL, recommended a single dose of methotrexate (50 mg/m²), and noted a second similar dose may be required during follow-up to increase success; some investigators have used an injection of 1 mg/kg directly into the ectopic sac, which appears to be as effective as intramuscular injections and causes fewer side effects but is more invasive; a 5-day regimen of methotrexate administered orally was not shown to be more effective than placebo; and because of potentially lethal interactions of aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) with methotrexate, it may be advisable for patients to avoid using these drugs concurrently with methotrexate until further research in this specific use is available.

### Should nitrous oxide ever be used in oncology patients receiving methotrexate therapy? [^114a72BJ]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2020). Medium credibility.

Nitrous oxide (N 2 O) is frequently used for short anesthesia/analgesia in children undergoing painful or repetitive procedures. Children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) require repeated lumbar punctures with direct instillation of intrathecal chemotherapy, usually the anti-folate agent methotrexate, during their treatment. These procedures are frequently performed under anesthesia. Concerns have been intermittently raised about a drug interaction between methotrexate and N 2 O that may potentiate the undesirable side effects of methotrexate, including neurotoxicity. However, the clinical evidence consists mainly of isolated case reports leading to a lack of consensus among pediatric anesthetists about the relative risk benefits of using N 2 O in children with ALL. In this article, we review the biochemical basis and scientific observations that suggest a significant interaction between N 2 O and methotrexate due to their dual inhibition of the key enzyme methionine synthase. The possible role of this interaction in potentiating neurotoxicity in children with cancer is discussed, and arguments and counterarguments about the clinical significance of this largely theoretical relationship are explored. Following comprehensive review of all the available data, we make the case for the circumstantial evidence being sufficiently compelling to prompt a review of practice by pediatric anesthetists and call for a precautionary approach by avoiding the use of N 2 O in children receiving concurrent methotrexate.

### A previously unknown drug-drug interaction is suspected in delayed elimination of plasma methotrexate in high-dose methotrexate therapy [^1166GYZ1]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Background: High-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) therapy is widely implemented for leukemia, osteosarcoma, and lymphoma. Although various measures have been taken to avoid toxicity from high serum MTX concentrations, there are many cases of delayed elimination of MTX. Objective: We suspected that delayed elimination of serum MTX was caused by unknown interactions between MTX and concomitant drugs. Methods: Concerning concomitant drugs in the case of delayed elimination of MTX, we performed screening tests in 35 patients who had undergone HD-MTX therapy. We then investigated the risk factors for delayed MTX elimination in 94 patients with leukemia, lymphoma, or osteosarcoma retrospectively. Results: The percentages of concomitant use of Stronger Neo-Minophagen C (SNMC), a glycyrrhizin preparation, and vincristine were higher in the delayed group. The percentage of delayed MTX elimination in patients receiving HD-MTX therapy was 41%. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that the concomitant use of SNMC solely was a significant risk factor for delayed MTX (odds ratio = 12.20; 95% CI = 1.06–139.84). Conclusion and Relevance: Concomitant use of SNMC was shown to be related to delayed elimination of serum MTX, and our results suggested a previously unknown drug-drug interaction between MTX and SNMC.

### Pharmacokinetic interaction between methotrexate and chloral hydrate [^114moEBT]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

We report the case of a drug interaction between methotrexate (MTX) and chloral hydrate (CH) observed in a child treated for acute leukemia. Significantly slower MTX clearance and increased MTX exposure occurred on the first three courses of a high-dose chemotherapy when co-administered with CH despite normal renal function, adequate hydration, and alkalinization. Mean MTX area under the curve associated with CH administration was 1,134µmolhours/L, compared to 608µmolhours/L after discontinuation of CH. This interaction possibly resulted from a competition between anionic CH metabolites and MTX for renal tubular excretion.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on pharmacological interventions for adults with obesity [^111Et597]. Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Phentermine — special clinical considerations include availability and dosing, cautions, and contraindications: Phentermine is available in capsules at doses of 15 mg, 30 mg, and 37.5 mg, and in tablet formulation at 8 mg and 37.5 mg; the recommended dosage is to be taken once daily up to 37.5 mg, preferably earlier in the day to minimize risk of insomnia, and in 2016 an 8 mg tablet was approved in the United States for dosing up to 3 times per day approximately 30 minutes before meals, with scored tablets allowing dosing as low as 4 mg. Currently, there are no large cardiovascular outcome trial data for long-term use of phentermine-topiramate ER or phentermine monotherapy, so caution is advised and it should be avoided in patients with a history of cardiovascular disease or uncontrolled hypertension; phase 3 trials enrolled subjects up to the age of 70 years without high-quality geriatric data, it should be avoided in patients treated with, or within 14 days of, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and due to concerns for arrhythmias and seizures, phentermine should not be used in patients with untreated hyperthyroidism; commonly reported adverse effects included constipation, dry mouth, palpitations, insomnia, and irritability.

### Dutch pharmacogenetics working group guideline for the gene-drug interaction of ABCG2, HLA-B and allopurinol, and MTHFR, folic acid and methotrexate [^116ujoYt]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2024). Medium credibility.

The Dutch Pharmacogenetics Working Group (DPWG) aims to facilitate PGx implementation by developing evidence-based pharmacogenetics guidelines to optimize pharmacotherapy. This guideline describes the gene-drug interaction of ABCG2 with allopurinol, HLA-B with allopurinol, MTHFR with folic acid, and MTHFR with methotrexate, relevant for the treatment of gout, cancer, and rheumatoid arthritis. A systematic review was performed based on which pharmacotherapeutic recommendations were developed. Allopurinol is less effective in patients with the ABCG2 p.(Gln141Lys) variant. In HLA-B✱58:01 carriers, the risk of severe cutaneous adverse events associated with allopurinol is strongly increased. The DPWG recommends using a higher allopurinol dose in patients with the ABCG2 p.(Gln141Lys) variant. For HLA-B✱58:01 positive patients the DPWG recommends choosing an alternative (for instance febuxostat). The DPWG indicates that another option would be to precede treatment with allopurinol tolerance induction. Genotyping of ABCG2 in patients starting on allopurinol was judged to be 'potentially beneficial' for drug effectiveness, meaning genotyping can be considered on an individual patient basis. Genotyping for HLA-B✱58:01 in patients starting on allopurinol was judged to be 'beneficial' for drug safety, meaning it is advised to consider genotyping the patient before (or directly after) drug therapy has been initiated. For MTHFR-folic acid there is evidence for a gene-drug interaction, but there is insufficient evidence for a clinical effect that makes therapy adjustment useful. Finally, for MTHFR-methotrexate there is insufficient evidence for a gene-drug interaction.

### Combinatorial GxGxE CRISPR screen identifies SLC25A39 in mitochondrial glutathione transport linking iron homeostasis to OXPHOS [^1156az3m]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

The long-term galactose adaptation might directly inhibit THF cofactor biosynthesis, providing additional means to buffer the defective mitochondrial THF import in the SLC25A32 KOs. Two enzymes involved in cytosolic THF biosynthesis, DHFR and MTHFR, utilize NADPH cofactors (Supplementary Fig. 2g). Long-term galactose adaptation (2 weeks) appeared to reduce the cellular NADH/NAD + ratio and NADPH/NADP + ratio, albeit not significantly (Supplementary Fig. 2i), as well as all major THF species (Supplementary Fig. 2h). The data are consistent with the report that decreased PPP flux and G6PD activity might impair NADPH and THF biosynthesis. The exception is an increase of the mitochondrial 5,10-me + -THF, likely due to an upregulation of the mitochondrial 1 C metabolism in galactose.

We further extended the observed buffering interaction by directly inhibiting the folate pathway with either low-folate media or a well-known folate pathway inhibitor, methotrexate. Cells cultured in low folate or treated with sub-IC50 concentration of methotrexate proliferated slower than the controls, and this fitness defect is completely blunted while culturing cells in galactose (Fig. 2g). Here, by converting the GxE interaction to an environment-by-environment (ExE) interaction, we show that PPP flux might modulate folate metabolism. In particular, a lower ribose biosynthesis rate might mask folate deficiency or confer methotrexate resistance, with potentially broad implications in metabolic disorders and cancer therapy.

GxGxE interactions in paralogous genes

To explore pairwise genetic interactions, we scored the strength of the GxG interactions using the π-score(Supplementary Fig. 3a), which allows comparison of the fitness consequences of a double knockout relative to what is expected by the simple addition of two single knockouts. For genetic perturbations that confer fitness defects, a negative π-score defines "synthetic sick" and a positive π-score defines "buffering", respectively (Supplementary Data 3). Scores for all GxG pairs are summarized in Supplementary Figs. 6–9. Here, we focus on SLC25 gene pairs with large effect sizes (absolute π-score > 0.25) and with significance (FDR < 2%). We excluded gene pairs exhibiting "ceiling" and "deader than dead" effects (see Methods).

### Current and emerging medications for overweight or obesity in people with comorbidities [^113gVHp2]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Phentermine Monotherapy

Phentermine is a sympathomimetic amine anorectic 45. Having received initial approval in 1959, it is indicated in the United States for short‐term weight management (the label states 'a few weeks', which is commonly taken to mean up to 12 weeks 45, 46), as an adjunct to caloric restriction and lifestyle modifications, in those with a BMI ≥ 30 or ≥ 27 kg/m 2 and weight‐related comorbidities 45. The usual maximum adult dose of phentermine hydrochloride (brand name ADIPEX‐P®) is 37.5 mg (30 mg base phentermine) once daily, but an individualized dose should be used to obtain an adequate response with the lowest possible dose 45. In clinical practice, it is common for physicians to prescribe the generic 37.5 mg tablet and advise the recipient to take a half tablet (18.75 mg) once daily in the mid‐morning. According to the phentermine label, increased weight loss with 'anorectic drugs' compared with placebo is modest ('a fraction of a pound per week') and occurs during the first few weeks of therapy, tending to decrease in succeeding weeks 45. A meta‐analysis of six 2–24‐week randomized clinical trials found that participants who received phentermine lost an additional 3.6 kg of their body weight compared with those who received placebo (imputation method for missing values not stated) 47.

People with overweight or obesity and comorbid diabetes who are treated with phentermine may require reductions in concomitant antihyperglycaemic medication 45. Phentermine monotherapy should be used with caution in those with hypertension because of the risk of an increase in blood pressure 45, although statistically significant increases have not been universally observed 48. Phentermine is contraindicated in those with a history of cardiovascular disease and in pregnancy (category X) 45.

### Lansoprazole (Prevacid) [^116iAAMT]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Methotrexate and 7-hydroxymethotrexate:

In an open-label, single-arm, eight day, pharmacokinetic study of 28 adult rheumatoid arthritis patients (who required the chronic use of 7.5 to 15 mg of methotrexate given weekly), administration of seven days of naproxen 500 mg twice daily and PREVACID 30 mg daily had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of methotrexate and 7-hydroxymethotrexate. While this study was not designed to assess the safety of this combination of drugs, no major adverse reactions were noted. However, this study was conducted with low doses of methotrexate. A drug interaction study with high doses of methotrexate has not been conducted [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)].

Amoxicillin:

PREVACID has also been shown to have no clinically significant interaction with amoxicillin.

Sucralfate:

In a single-dose crossover study examining PREVACID 30 mg administered alone and concomitantly with sucralfate 1 gram, absorption of lansoprazole was delayed and the bioavailability was reduced by 17% when administered concomitantly with sucralfate [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Drug Interactions (7)].

Antacids:

In clinical trials, antacids were administered concomitantly with PREVACID and there was no evidence of a change in the efficacy of PREVACID.

Clopidogrel:

Clopidogrel is metabolized to its active metabolite in part by CYP2C19. A study of healthy subjects who were CYP2C19 extensive metabolizers, receiving once daily administration of clopidogrel 75 mg alone or concomitantly with PREVACID 30 mg (n = 40), for nine days was conducted. The mean AUC of the active metabolite of clopidogrel was reduced by approximately 14% (mean AUC ratio was 86%, with 90% CI of 80 to 92%) when PREVACID was coadministered compared to administration of clopidogrel alone.

Pharmacodynamic parameters were also measured and demonstrated that the change in inhibition of platelet aggregation (induced by 5 mcM ADP) was related to the change in the exposure to clopidogrel active metabolite. The effect on exposure to the active metabolite of clopidogrel and on clopidogrel-induced platelet inhibition is not considered clinically important.

Effect of Other Drugs on Lansoprazole

Because lansoprazole is metabolized by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4, inducers and inhibitors of these enzymes may potentially alter exposure of lansoprazole.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

7.1	Drugs Having Clinically Important Interactions with Effexor XR

7.2	Other Drug Interactions with Effexor XR

Central Nervous System (CNS)-Active Drugs

The risk of using venlafaxine concomitantly with other CNS-active drugs (including alcohol) has not been systematically evaluated. Consequently, caution is advised when Effexor XR is taken concomitantly in combination with other CNS-active drugs.

Weight Loss Agents

Concomitant use of Effexor XR and weight loss agents is not recommended. The safety and efficacy of venlafaxine therapy in combination with weight loss agents, including phentermine, have not been established. Effexor XR is not indicated for weight loss alone or in combination with other products.

Laboratory Test Interference

False-positive urine immunoassay screening tests for phencyclidine (PCP) and amphetamine have been reported in patients taking venlafaxine due to lack of specificity of the screening tests. False-positive test results may be expected for several days following discontinuation of venlafaxine therapy. Confirmatory tests, such as gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, will distinguish venlafaxine from PCP and amphetamine.

### Psoriatic flare after the concomitant administration of L-methylfolate and methotrexate [^116RUWpP]. JAAD Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first report describing the interaction of L-methylfolate and methotrexate in the context of any medical condition. To date, treatment of psoriasis in patients receiving L-methylfolate specifically has not been studied and no guidelines have been established. The successful treatment by an immune biologic agent with an entirely different mechanism of action combined with the fact that this patient was stable on methotrexate before administration of L-methylfolate, suggests that a drug interaction between the 2 caused the patient's psoriatic flare. The medical literature reports that, consistent with our case, folate administered concurrently with methotrexate often alleviates side effects of methotrexate therapy but hinders efficacy of treatment. Given that methotrexate's successful treatment of psoriasis is owing to inhibition of folate metabolism, it is logical that concurrent administration of L-methylfolate, folate's most biologically active metabolite, would significantly reduce its efficacy. Furthermore, the dose equivalence of folate and L-methylfolate is likely not equivalent, with L-methylfolate being a more potent chemical for many patients because conversion of folic acid to the biologically active L-methylfolate is highly variable owing to genetic variations and mutations in the MTHFR gene, resulting in many individuals who are unable to metabolize folate into L-methylfolate. Therefore, L-methylfolate administered to a poor metabolizer of folate, such as the patient presented here, would result in a much higher equivalent dose than that of folate alone.

As a new and potentially more potent form of folic acid supplementation, L-methylfolate may cause significantly decreased methotrexate efficacy for the treatment of psoriasis, and providers should be aware of this possible drug interaction. In the future, dermatologists should consider the use of other systemic agents, such as the immunobiologics, to treat psoriasis in patients receiving L-methylfolate for depression. We present this case to highlight the implications of this new medication and how it may affect remission in psoriatic patients successfully treated with methotrexate.

### Underestimation of the efficacy, effectiveness, tolerability, and safety of weekly low-dose methotrexate in information presented to physicians and patients [^114Y64g6]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

Ten specific examples of the underestimation of the efficacy, effectiveness and tolerability, and overestimation of adverse events of weekly, low-dose methotrexate, administered with folic acid, in treatment of rheumatic diseases are summarised. These examples include: 1) meta-analyses of clinical trials suggest that methotrexate has an efficacy similar to other disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs); 2) information in textbooks and websites may overstate adverse events and drug interactions associated with weekly low-dose methotrexate; 3) information presented to patients when filling a prescription for methotrexate understates 'side effects' of RA and overstates those of methotrexate; 4) an admonition to patients to refrain entirely from consumption of alcohol while taking methotrexate may be unnecessary; 5) frequent blood testing in patients who take methotrexate may be overused; 6) eligibility of only a small minority of patients for clinical trials to compare biologic agents and methotrexate; 7) Step-up design in most comparisons of biologic agents with methotrexate includes only patients who had experienced an incomplete response to methotrexate; 8) in parallel design trials, the efficacy of biologic agents is not substantially greater than that of methotrexate; 9) low, inflexible dosage schedules of methotrexate and requirement for withdrawal with minimal liver function abnormalities in many clinical trials may underestimate efficacy, effectiveness, tolerability and safety; 10) interpretation of clinical trial results may overstate the clinical significance of lower radiographic progression in patients treated with biologic agents versus patients treated with methotrexate. More accurate interpretation of information for physicians and other health professionals, as well as patients, concerning use of weekly low-dose methotrexate in contemporary care could improve care and outcomes for patients with RA and other rheumatic diseases.

Long-term Phentermine Pharmacotherapy: An Investigation for Symptoms of Dependence, Cravings, or Withdrawal ClinicalTrials. gov ID. Study Overview Phentermine, an amphetamine congener, is the most widely used anti-obesity drug in the U. S. Although phentermine is the agent-of-choice among physicians specializing in obesity treatment, the use of this drug for obesity treatment by other physicians has long been curtailed because misapprehensions regarding phentermine safety. Concerns of phentermine-induced adverse cardiovascular reactions and of phentermine-induced addiction are two fears that have had a profound negative impact on phentermine prescribing. Although warnings of high incidence rates of adverse cardiovascular and psychiatric effects are included in FDA labeling and are often repeated in published reviews, the few clinical reports in the peer-reviewed medical literature of such adverse effects are anecdotal.

The addiction potential of a drug may be investigated by measuring the drug's propensity to induce dependence, to induce cravings for the drug, and for cessation of the drug to induce characteristic withdrawal symptoms. In the case of amphetamine withdrawal symptoms appear very quickly reaching a maximum at 48 hours after drug cessation. Hypotheses
- Long-term phentermine-treated patients do not develop phentermine dependence or cravings.
- LPT patients who cease taking phentermine abruptly do not experience amphetamine-like withdrawal symptoms. Specific Aims
- To compare the severity of phentermine dependence and craving between LPT patients and acute phentermine-treated patients
- To compare the severity of stimulant withdrawal symptoms before and after phentermine cessation in LPT patients.
- **To examine the prevalence of phentermine dependence in LPT patients Drug**: Abrupt cessation of phentermine pharmacotherapy
