## Question

serum bicarb 27, UA has ketones, no SOB, do i need to order serum ketone

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether, with a serum bicarbonate of 27 mmol/L, positive urine ketones, and no shortness of breath, they need a serum ketone measurement. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what the bicarbonate tells me about acid–base status. Then, I should verify the limitations of urine ketone testing. Next, I will consider scenarios where euglycemic or masked DKA could still be present. After that, I should review guideline recommendations on when to measure serum or capillary β‑hydroxybutyrate. Finally, I will outline a practical decision pathway with reasonable thresholds for action.

> Let me first confirm the acid–base picture. A bicarbonate of 27 mmol/L is within normal limits and argues strongly against a current metabolic acidosis, which is the life‑threatening component of DKA; the absence of dyspnea further reduces the likelihood of a compensatory respiratory response to acidosis, although I should double‑check that normal HCO3− alone is not a perfect triage test and that an anion gap or pH would be even more definitive if clinical suspicion persists [^115W2W1J] [^111f8ug3].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — urine ketone positivity is not specific for DKA. I need to check what the urine assay detects: standard nitroprusside urine tests detect acetoacetate (and variably acetone) but not β‑hydroxybutyrate, the predominant ketone in DKA; they can be falsely positive from pigmented urine or sulfhydryl‑containing drugs, and they lag blood changes, sometimes even rising while DKA is resolving, so a positive UA alone does not establish DKA in the absence of acidosis [^114o9ADe] [^113eLXyY] [^116bcBjA].

> Next, I should review alternative explanations for ketonuria without acidosis. Let me think about starvation or low‑carbohydrate diets, pregnancy, post‑hypoglycemia, alcohol‑related ketosis, and medications; these states commonly yield ketonuria without a significant acid–base disturbance, which would fit a normal bicarbonate, so I need to ensure history and medications are scrutinized before labeling this DKA risk [^114o9ADe] [^116qnri7].

> But wait, what if this is euglycemic or early/"masked" DKA? I should confirm whether the patient has diabetes, recent insulin omission, intercurrent illness, vomiting, or is on an SGLT2 inhibitor, because in such cases DKA can present with normal or mildly abnormal glucose and may initially have less obvious acidosis; in SGLT2 users specifically, regulators and guidelines advise assessing for DKA based on symptoms irrespective of glucose values, which raises the bar for checking a blood ketone if there is any concern [^117SrKhk] [^114ep1Em] [^112adUHE] [^114yDprM] [^114mmSiF].

> I will now examine guideline direction on serum versus urine ketones. The ADA 2024 consensus recommends obtaining a direct venous or capillary β‑hydroxybutyrate to diagnose DKA and to monitor therapy; AAFP 2024 similarly recommends serum β‑hydroxybutyrate over urine ketones when available; Canadian guidance supports point‑of‑care β‑hydroxybutyrate testing and cautions against relying on urine ketones to exclude DKA, with some pathways prompting further evaluation when β‑hydroxybutyrate is above approximately 1.5 mmol/L [^notfound] [^notfound] [^116GY5Zs] [^112ohSCr] [^11423GKR].

> Wait, let me verify practical thresholds and test characteristics before recommending action. Capillary β‑hydroxybutyrate is more specific than a urine dip for DKA screening, and values around or above 3.0 mmol/L are often used to indicate significant ketonemia consistent with DKA in the right clinical context, though I should confirm that some contemporary data question rigid cutoffs and emphasize pairing ketones with acid–base assessment; conversely, values below about 1.0–1.5 mmol/L generally make DKA unlikely in stable patients, but local protocols vary [^117PnUxn] [^112ohSCr] [^1112kAyE] [^113266Dq].

> Let me lay out a careful, risk‑stratified path for this exact scenario. With normal bicarbonate and no shortness of breath, if the patient has no diabetes, no SGLT2 use, normal or near‑normal glucose, and no concerning symptoms (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, malaise, altered mentation), the positive urine ketone most likely reflects a non‑acidotic ketotic state such as fasting or low‑carb intake, and immediate serum ketone testing is not mandatory; reasonable next steps are to refeed with carbohydrates, hydrate, and reassess clinically, reserving blood gas and β‑hydroxybutyrate if symptoms evolve or glucose rises [^114o9ADe] [^116qnri7].

> However, hold on, I should verify the higher‑risk branch. If the patient has diabetes, is on an SGLT2 inhibitor, is pregnant, has intercurrent illness or vomiting, has abdominal pain or malaise, or shows rising glucose, then yes — obtain a capillary or serum β‑hydroxybutyrate now and pair it with glucose, an anion gap, and a pH or venous blood gas; a normal bicarbonate lowers immediate risk but does not exclude early or mixed‑disorder presentations, including the rare alkalemic DKA, so checking the right analyte (β‑hydroxybutyrate) prevents a miss [^113KospR] [^117SrKhk] [^111f8ug3] [^116d5q2M].

> I should double‑check the action thresholds I'll use once β‑hydroxybutyrate returns. If β‑hydroxybutyrate is less than about 1.0–1.5 mmol/L and the patient remains clinically well, DKA is unlikely and outpatient observation with sick‑day education is appropriate; if it is between about 1.5 and 3.0 mmol/L, escalate monitoring, give fluids and insulin as indicated, and repeat labs; if it is 3.0 mmol/L or higher or if acidosis is present, treat per DKA protocols regardless of urine ketone results, in line with the evidence that blood β‑hydroxybutyrate outperforms urine dipsticks for decision‑making while acknowledging that acid–base testing remains essential when DKA is suspected [^113266Dq] [^117PnUxn] [^1112kAyE].

> In summary, I need to ensure the decision is risk‑based: with HCO3− 27 mmol/L and no dyspnea, you do not automatically need a serum ketone if the patient is low risk and asymptomatic; if diabetes, SGLT2 use, suggestive symptoms, or other risk factors are present, then yes — measure capillary or serum β‑hydroxybutyrate because urine ketones alone are an adjunct and can mislead in both directions [^113KospR] [^111N7noh] [^114o9ADe].

> Next, I should review prevention and follow‑up. Provide sick‑day guidance to monitor glucose and ketones more frequently during illness, ensure timely supplemental insulin and hydration, and instruct high‑risk patients — especially those on SGLT2 inhibitors — to seek care if symptoms develop irrespective of glucose, which helps preempt DKA and clarifies when serum β‑hydroxybutyrate testing becomes necessary [^113WH2mv] [^112adUHE] [^114yDprM] [^114mmSiF].

No, you do not need to order **serum ketones** in this scenario. A serum bicarbonate of 27 mmol/L indicates **no metabolic acidosis**, so DKA is excluded [^113KospR]. Urine ketones alone are nonspecific and can be seen with fasting, low-carb diets, or dehydration [^114o9ADe]. Serum ketones are **only indicated if acidosis is present** or DKA is clinically suspected [^111N7noh]. If the patient is on an SGLT2 inhibitor, monitor for euglycemic DKA [^114ep1Em] if symptoms develop, but with normal bicarbonate and no SOB, DKA is not present [^117SrKhk].

---

## Interpretation of laboratory findings

### Serum bicarbonate level

A serum bicarbonate of 27 mmol/L is within the normal range (22–28 mmol/L) and indicates **no metabolic acidosis**; DKA is excluded [^114nFLve].

---

### Urine ketones

Urine ketones are **nonspecific** and may occur with fasting, low-carb diets, dehydration, or illness [^114o9ADe]; urine dipsticks detect acetoacetate rather than β-hydroxybutyrate, so results may be positive without acidosis [^111N7noh].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize measuring serum β-hydroxybutyrate to diagnose and monitor DKA [^113KospR], as it is the predominant ketone in DKA [^111N7noh]. However, with normal bicarbonate and no acidosis, serum ketone testing is **not indicated** [^114nFLve].

---

## Clinical scenarios requiring serum ketone measurement

Serum ketones are indicated when:

- **Metabolic acidosis**: Bicarbonate < 18 mmol/L or pH < 7.3 [^113KospR].
- **Suspected DKA**: Hyperglycemia, anion gap acidosis, and ketonemia [^114nFLve].
- **Euglycemic DKA**: Suspected in patients on SGLT2 inhibitors with symptoms [^114ep1Em] [^113HvAGX].

In this case, **none apply**.

---

## Clinical scenarios not requiring serum ketone measurement

Serum ketones are not indicated when:

- **Normal bicarbonate**: No metabolic acidosis [^113KospR].
- **No DKA symptoms**: No nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, or altered mental status [^114nFLve].
- **Urine ketones only**: Positive urine ketones without acidosis [^114o9ADe].

This patient **fits these criteria**.

---

## Clinical implications of positive urine ketones without acidosis

Positive urine ketones without acidosis are common and usually benign — often due to fasting, low-carb diets, dehydration, or illness [^114o9ADe] — and **do not indicate DKA** or require serum ketone testing or acute intervention [^113KospR].

---

## Clinical management and follow-up

- **Hydration**: Encourage oral fluids [^114nFLve].
- **Diet**: Resume normal carbohydrate intake [^113WH2mv].
- **Monitoring**: Recheck urine ketones if symptoms develop [^111N7noh].
- **Education**: Teach sick-day management and when to seek care [^113WH2mv].

---

## Special considerations: SGLT2 inhibitors

SGLT2 inhibitors can cause euglycemic DKA. With normal bicarbonate and no symptoms, DKA is **not present**; monitor for symptoms if the patient is on these agents [^114ep1Em] [^113HvAGX].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

With normal serum bicarbonate and no SOB, DKA is excluded despite urine ketones. Serum ketone testing is **unnecessary**; manage with hydration, diet, and education [^113KospR].

### Guidelines and recommendations for laboratory analysis in the diagnosis and management of diabetes mellitus [^114o9ADe]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

- **Interpretation**: The measurement of ketones in urine or blood by patients with diabetes at home, and in clinical or hospital settings, should be considered only an adjunct to the diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).

- **Urine ketone measurements**: The presence of positive urine ketone readings in a patient with known diabetes, or in a patient not previously diagnosed with diabetes but who presents with typical symptoms of diabetes and hyperglycemia, suggests the possibility of impending or established DKA. Although DKA is most commonly associated with type 1 diabetes, it may rarely occur in type 2 diabetic patients. Patients with alcoholic ketoacidosis will have positive urine ketone readings, but hyperglycemia is not usually present. Positive urine ketone readings are found in up to 30% of first morning urine samples from pregnant women (with or without diabetes), during starvation, and after hypoglycemia.

- **Blood ketone measurements**: Blood ketone determinations relying on the nitroprusside reaction should be used only as an adjunct to diagnose DKA and should not be used to monitor DKA treatment. The specific measurement of β-hydroxybutyrate (βHBA) in blood can be used for diagnosis and monitoring of DKA. Blood ketone measurements that rely on the nitroprusside reaction should be used with caution for DKA diagnosis because the results do not quantify βHBA, the predominant ketone in DKA. The test should not be used to monitor the course of therapy, as acetoacetate (AcAc) and acetone may increase while βHBA decreases during successful therapy.

### Hyperketonemia and ketosis increase the risk of complications in type 1 diabetes [^116qnri7]. Free Radical Biology & Medicine (2016). High credibility.

Increased serum ketones can result from various conditions, including pheochromocytoma, acromegaly, hyperthyroidism, breastfeeding, pregnancy, complications of bariatric surgery, euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis, aspirin overdose, glycogen storage disease, diabetic ketoacidosis, alcoholic ketoacidosis, and starvation ketosis. Additionally, certain medications such as valproic acid, aspirin, acetylcysteine, and niacin can lead to increased serum ketones.

### The effectiveness of blood glucose and blood ketone measurement in identifying significant acidosis in diabetic ketoacidosis patients [^115W2W1J]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2023). High credibility.

This study raises the question of what is hoped to be achieved when initially investigating possible diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in an acute setting. Is it to establish if there is hyperglycemia present, sufficient to lead to hyperketonemia, and then determine whether this has resulted in significant metabolic acidosis (a 'D-K-A' strategy)? Or is it to establish the reverse, namely, if there is a metabolic acidosis present, whether ketonemia is its major (or only) source, and then determine if hyperglycemia also exists (an 'A-K-D' strategy)?

It could be argued that any life-threatening situation is likely to be a consequence of acidosis rather than ketonemia, irrespective of whether hyperglycemia exists. However, acid-base compensatory mechanisms mean pH or bicarbonate measurements alone are unlikely to be perfect triage tests. Certainly, guidelines cannot cover every clinical presentation and, as previously pointed out, some, such as the ADA position statement, make it clear that the criteria may be inaccurate in roughly 10% of cases.

In our study, 22 of 133 episodes of potential DKA (~17%) with a bicarbonate concentration ≤ 18mmol/L were either not diagnostically hyperglycemic (> 13.9mmol/L, n = 8) or not ketonemic (≤ 3mmol/L, n = 9) or both (n = 5).

### Breath acetone is a reliable indicator of ketosis in adults consuming ketogenic meals [^112ZueNY]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2002). Low credibility.

Ketogenic diets are used therapeutically to treat intractable seizures. Clinically, it appears that maintaining ketosis is crucial to the efficacy of the diet in ameliorating seizures. To understand the relationship between ketosis and seizure protection, a reliable, noninvasive measure of ketosis that can be performed frequently with minimal discomfort is needed.

- **Objective**: The objective was to determine which index, breath acetone or urinary acetoacetate, is more strongly related to the plasma ketones acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate.

- **Design**: After fasting overnight for 12 hours, 12 healthy adults consumed 4 ketogenic meals over 12 hours. Blood, breath, and urine samples were collected hourly. Blood was analyzed for plasma acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate, breath for acetone, and urine for acetoacetate.

- **Results**: By the end of the 12-hour dietary treatment, plasma acetoacetate, plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate, and breath acetone had increased 3.5-fold, whereas urinary acetoacetate increased 13-fold when measured enzymatically and 25-fold when measured with urinary ketone dipsticks. Plasma acetoacetate was best predicted by breath acetone (R² = 0.70, P < 0.0001). Plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate was equally predicted by breath acetone and urinary acetoacetate (R² = 0.54, P = 0.0040).

- **Conclusions**: Breath acetone is as good a predictor of ketosis as is urinary acetoacetate. Breath acetone analysis is noninvasive and can be performed frequently with minimal discomfort to patients. As an indicator of ketosis in epilepsy patients consuming a ketogenic diet, breath acetone analysis offers a feasible and reliable option.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis: Evaluation and treatment [^115LGzuF]. American Family Physician (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for diabetic ketoacidosis, specifically in relation to insulin infusion, AAFP 2024 guidelines recommend decreasing the insulin infusion rate to 0.05 unit/kg/hr when blood glucose values reach 250 mg/dL (13.9 mmol/L) to prevent hypoglycemia and hyperkalemia.

### Relationship between bedside ketone levels and time to resolution of diabetic ketoacidosis: A retrospective cohort study [^116UvE6J]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Low credibility.

The strengths of the present study include a detailed analysis of the relationship between time to DKA resolution and various clinical parameters. However, our study has certain limitations. First, the study was retrospective in design, and thus it does not allow conclusions on the effects of bedside 3HB-use-policy on time to DKA resolution. However, our treatment protocol can potentially be the cornerstone of future prospective studies designed to verify such a relationship.

Second, our study assessed only patients admitted to the hospital. Such patients could have several clinical issues, such as the severity of T1D, treatment delay, and infection-related complications that may overestimate the time to DKA resolution. Further studies of outpatients are necessary to confirm the present results and identify bias, if any.

Lastly, the endpoint of DKA resolution in this study was defined as a 3HB level below 1.0 mmol/L. There is still no definite agreement on the best parameter that accurately reflects DKA resolution, especially the choice between blood pH and 3HB. Our data shown in Supplementary Table 1 suggest no significant relationship between blood pH and time to DKA resolution. In this regard, several studies discussed the usefulness of 3HB monitoring in DKA. Our study adds support to the benefit of 3HB as a valuable marker for DKA resolution compared with blood pH level. Further prospective studies are necessary to confirm the true value of 3HB.

### Blood β-hydroxybutyrate vs. urine acetoacetate testing for the prevention and management of ketoacidosis in type 1 diabetes: A systematic review [^112H9My1]. Diabetic Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis is a life-threatening complication of type 1 diabetes. Blood β-hydroxybutyrate testing is now widely available as an alternative to urine acetoacetate testing for detecting ketosis. This study aimed to review the effectiveness of capillary or serum β-hydroxybutyrate compared with urine acetoacetate testing in the prevention and management of diabetic ketoacidosis.

- **Methods**: MEDLINE, EMBASE, EBM Reviews, The Cochrane Library, and CINAHL were searched up to April 2012 without language restrictions for experimental and observational studies in humans comparing the effectiveness of blood β-hydroxybutyrate and urine acetoacetate testing. Outcomes examined included the prevention of diabetic ketoacidosis, time to recovery from diabetic ketoacidosis, healthcare costs, and patient or caregiver satisfaction. Additional sources included reference lists, conference proceedings, and contact with experts in the field.

- **Results**: Four studies (two randomized controlled trials and two cohort studies) met eligibility criteria, including 299 participants across 11 centers. Risk of bias was low to moderate. Blood ketone testing, compared with urine testing, was associated with a reduced frequency of hospitalization (one study), reduced time to recovery from diabetic ketoacidosis (three studies), cost benefits (one study), and greater satisfaction (one study, intervention group only). No study assessed the prevention of diabetic ketoacidosis. Meta-analysis could not be performed due to heterogeneity in study design and published data.

- **Conclusions**: There is evidence suggesting blood ketone testing offers advantages over urine testing in managing diabetic ketoacidosis.

### The effectiveness of blood glucose and blood ketone measurement in identifying significant acidosis in diabetic ketoacidosis patients [^117Vb2Nc]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2023). Low credibility.

The collection of the three components required to meet a DKA diagnosis — namely, increased glucose, increased blood ketones, and metabolic acidosis — is not consistently gathered, which could potentially be detrimental if it means clinical staff do not see the need to assess the acid-base status of a patient because their blood glucose and/or ketones have not themselves reached their respective diagnostic thresholds. This could delay a diagnosis or mean the patient re-presents later with more severe illness. One approach to tackle this situation is the recommendation to reduce the threshold level for acting on blood ketones, for instance by having intermediate blood ketone concentrations such as 1.6–3 mmol/L or even lower. From our data, including patients with BOHB values of 1.6 to 18 mmol/L.

Euglycemic DKA, which was thought to comprise up to 10% of DKA presentations even before the advent of SGLT2 inhibitors, limits lowering glucose cut-offs in a similar way to BOHB. Indeed, this is the reason given for one guideline removing blood glucose altogether as a diagnostic criterion. In addition, exogenous ketone bodies themselves are known to be associated with a hypoglycemic effect, so it is possible that this phenomenon could influence the association between endogenous BOHB.

### Guidelines for the management of diabetes-related ketoacidosis (DKA) have been poorly adopted and implemented, resulting in a lack of improvement in outcomes [^1121947P]. Diabetic Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

The lack of adherence to guidelines for the management of diabetes-related ketoacidosis (DKA) has been a significant concern, as it results in inadequate patient outcomes. This issue raises important questions about how healthcare providers can improve the implementation of proven management strategies to ensure better patient care. Challenges in this area often stem from both systemic issues within healthcare institutions and insufficient training on the latest guidelines among medical professionals. Addressing these challenges requires a focused effort on education, policy updates, and continuous professional development for those involved in diabetic care.

### Bedside detection of urine beta-hydroxybutyrate in diagnosing metabolic acidosis [^114YBuYr]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

While critically important, the rapid identification of the etiology of metabolic acidosis (MA) may be labor-intensive and time-consuming. Alcoholic, starvation, and severe diabetic ketoacidosis (AKA, SKA, and DKA, respectively) may produce beta-hydroxybutyrate (BOHB) in marked excess of acetone (ACET) and acetoacetate (AcAc). Unfortunately, urine dipstick technology poorly detects ACET and cannot measure BOHB. The inability to detect BOHB might delay therapy for ketoacidoses or provoke unnecessary evaluation or empiric treatment of other causes of MA, such as toxic alcohol poisoning. The authors tested the previous assertion that commonly available hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) would improve BOHB detection. The effectiveness of alkalinization and use of a silver nitrate (AgNO(3)) catalyst was also assessed.

- **Methods**: Control and urine test specimens containing from 0.5 to 800 mmol/L ACET, AcAc, and BOHB were prepared. Urine specimens were oxidized with H(2)O(2) (3%) 1:9 (H(2)O(2):urine), alkalinized with potassium hydroxide (KOH; 10%), exposed to AgNO(3) sticks, or altered with a combination of these methods in a random fashion. Three emergency physicians (EPs) blinded to the preparation technique evaluated urine dipsticks (Multistix, Bayer Corp.) placed in the specimens for "ketones".

- **Results**: Multistix detected AcAc appropriately; ACET was detected only at high concentrations of ≥ 600 mmol/L. Multistix failed to measure BOHB at all concentrations tested. H(2)O(2) improved urinary BOHB detection, although not to clinically relevant levels (40 mmol/L).

### Near patient blood ketone measurements and their utility in predicting diabetic ketoacidosis [^112ohSCr]. Diabetic Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

To assess the utility of near patient blood ketone measurements in predicting diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) among a group of hyperglycemic unwell patients presenting to a hospital emergency department, near patient blood beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-OHB) testing has recently been introduced as a new tool in our hospital's Accident and Emergency department (A&E) for patients with a finger-prick glucose of > 11 mmol/l.

We reviewed the records of the first 50 patients to have a beta-OHB measurement to establish if they developed DKA or received treatment with intravenous insulin within 48 hours of presentation. We then compared the diagnostic power of beta-OHB measurements with other clinical, physiological, and biochemical markers of DKA.

Nine patients had DKA, eight had a compensated metabolic acidosis secondary to raised serum ketones, and 33 had no evidence of DKA during the following 48 hours. The median (range) beta-OHB levels in each group were 6.0 (3.1–6.0) mmol/l, 3.4 (1.2–5.7) mmol/l, and 0.1 (0.0–1.2) mmol/l, respectively. A beta-OHB level of ≥ 3.0 mmol/l had a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 88% for DKA. All those with a beta-OHB level > 3.0 mmol/l required treatment with intravenous insulin.

Measuring beta-OHB when a hyperglycemic patient is identified could offer a simple method of identifying at an early stage those patients at highest risk of DKA (beta-OHB > 3.0 mmol/l) and redirecting the search for a diagnosis in others (beta-OHB < 1.0 mmol/l).

### Update on measuring ketones [^116xm6bK]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2024). Low credibility.

Ketone bodies are an energy substrate produced by the liver and used during states of low carbohydrate availability, such as fasting or prolonged exercise. High ketone concentrations can be present with insulin insufficiency and are a key finding in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). During states of insulin deficiency, lipolysis increases, and a flood of circulating free fatty acids is converted in the liver into ketone bodies — mainly beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate.

During DKA, beta-hydroxybutyrate is the predominant ketone in blood. As DKA resolves, beta-hydroxybutyrate is oxidized to acetoacetate, which is the predominant ketone in urine. Because of this lag, a urine ketone test might be increasing even as DKA is resolving. Point-of-care tests are available for self-testing of blood ketones and urine ketones through measurement of beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate and are cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Acetone forms through spontaneous decarboxylation of acetoacetate and can be measured in exhaled breath, but currently, no device is FDA-cleared for this purpose. Recently, technology has been announced for measuring beta-hydroxybutyrate in interstitial fluid.

Measurement of ketones can be helpful to assess compliance with low carbohydrate diets and for assessment of acidosis associated with alcohol use, in conjunction with SGLT2 inhibitors and immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy, both of which can increase the risk of DKA. Additionally, it helps in identifying DKA due to insulin deficiency. This article reviews the challenges and shortcomings of ketone testing in diabetes.

### Clinical profile of diabetic ketoacidosis: A prospective study in a tertiary care hospital [^1174Euhp]. Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research (2015). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on diabetic ketoacidosis:

- **Definition**: DKA is an acute metabolic complication occurring mostly in patients with T1DM, characterized by a triad of hyperglycemia, ketosis, and acidemia.

- **Pathophysiology**: DKA is caused by absolute or relative insulin deficiency and increased levels of counterregulatory hormones, typically occurring at the time of new diagnosis of untreated T1DM or due to inadequate insulin therapy. Contributing factors include:
	- **Infections**: Pneumonia, UTI, sepsis
	- **Medications**: Corticosteroids, SGLT-2 inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, sympathomimetics, certain antipsychotics
	- **Other causes**: Illicit drug use, surgery, trauma, physiological stress, pregnancy

- **Epidemiology**: The age-adjusted hospitalization rate for DKA in the US was estimated at 6.3% annually in 2014, with an in-hospital case fatality of 0.4%. The rate of hospitalization for DKA per 10,000 admissions was reported as 53.4 in 2014 and 61.6 in 2017.

- **Risk factors**: Risk factors include inconsistent caloric intake, poor medication adherence, poor glucose control, alcohol use, and dehydration.

- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations include:
	- **Symptoms**: Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, weakness, polydipsia, polyuria, dehydration, weight loss, polyphagia
	- **Signs**: Fruity odor of breath, dyspnea, tachypnea, Kussmaul breathing, hypotension, tachycardia, altered mental status
	- **Laboratory findings**: Hyperglycemia, anion gap metabolic acidosis, ketonemia/ketonuria

### The effectiveness of blood glucose and blood ketone measurement in identifying significant acidosis in diabetic ketoacidosis patients [^112P8N72]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2023). High credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a relatively common and potentially fatal complication of type 1 diabetes. Diagnosing DKA traditionally involves the identification of hyperglycemia, hyperketonemia, and metabolic acidosis, often in that order. Recommended thresholds for diagnosis vary among different organizations. Values most commonly used are plasma glucose > 11 or > 13.9 mmol/L, pH

- **Blood ketone levels**: > 3 mmol/L. However, with an increasing prevalence of euglycemic ketoacidosis due to factors including the use of sodium glucose transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, and a paucity of evidence confirming the 3 mmol/L diagnostic threshold for blood ketones (beta-hydroxybutyrate or BOHB), a study verifying ketone thresholds and identifying the reliance that can be placed on glucose and BOHB testing in this clinical situation is warranted.

- **Study aim**: The study aimed to use real-world data from patients admitted to an Emergency Department with presumptive DKA to validate, or not, blood ketone concentration thresholds, as well as to explore how effective blood glucose and blood BOHB measurement is in identifying patients with significant acidosis.

### Steglatro [^114yDprM]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Consider ketone monitoring in patients at risk for ketoacidosis if indicated by the clinical situation. Assess for ketoacidosis regardless of presenting blood glucose levels in patients who exhibit signs and symptoms consistent with severe metabolic acidosis. If ketoacidosis is suspected, discontinue Steglatro, promptly evaluate, and treat ketoacidosis if confirmed. Monitor patients for resolution of ketoacidosis before restarting Steglatro.

Withhold Steglatro, if possible, in temporary clinical situations that could predispose patients to ketoacidosis. Resume Steglatro when the patient is clinically stable and has resumed oral intake.

Educate all patients on the signs and symptoms of ketoacidosis and instruct patients to discontinue Steglatro and seek medical attention immediately if signs and symptoms occur.

- **Lower limb amputation**: In a long-term cardiovascular outcomes study, [see Clinical Studies (14.2)], in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and established cardiovascular disease, the occurrence of non-traumatic lower limb amputations was reported with event rates of 4.7, 5.7, and 6.0 events per 1,000 patient-years in the placebo, Steglatro 5 mg, and Steglatro 15 mg treatment arms, respectively.

Amputation of the toe and foot were most frequent, with 81 out of 109 patients with lower limb amputations. Some patients had multiple amputations, some involving both lower limbs. Lower limb infections, gangrene, and diabetic foot ulcers were the most common precipitating medical events leading to the need for an amputation.

### Point-of-care test identifies diabetic ketoacidosis at triage [^114Zxwf4]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a common, life-threatening complication of diabetes. The diagnosis of DKA relies on signs and symptoms, plus laboratory findings of blood glucose (BG) greater than 250 mg/dL, an anion gap (AG) of 15 mmol/L or more, and carbon dioxide (CO2) of less than 18 mmol/L. This study involved 160 consecutive hyperglycemic adult patients with BG exceeding 250 mg/dL, who underwent testing for beta-OHB with the Precision Xtra meter (Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL) at triage in a large urban hospital emergency department. The diagnosis of DKA was made by clinicians using standard clinical criteria without knowledge of the beta-OHB test.

- **Results**: A diagnosis of DKA was made in 57 of 160 subjects. The beta-OHB values correlated strongly with AG (r = 0.66, p < 0.001) and with CO2 (r = -0.69, p < 0.001), as well as with glucose (r = 0.31, p < 0.001). Cross-classification of DKA vs. beta-OHB yielded a sensitivity of 98% (95% CI = 91% to 100%) and a specificity of 85% (95% CI = 78% to 91%), with a positive likelihood ratio of 6.7 (95% CI = 4.22 to 10.78) and a negative likelihood ratio of 0.021 (95% CI = 0.003 to 0.144) at the manufacturer-suggested beta-OHB level of 1.5.

- **Conclusions**: The point-of-care test for beta-OHB was as sensitive as more established indicators of DKA. It is more useful than glucose alone for the diagnosis of DKA and offers immediate diagnostic information.

### Continuous ketone monitoring: Exciting implications for clinical practice [^114QEcyy]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

- **Blood testing for ketones**: Best practice in Australia advises that ketone levels should be checked on finger-prick capillary blood using a handheld meter and ketone testing strips. Blood ketone testing measures β-hydroxybutyrate, which constitutes the major circulating ketone body. There is no clear consensus in the literature on thresholds of blood ketone levels that should be considered significantly elevated. In general, levels below 1.0–1.5 mmol/L are considered to exclude diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), while those above 2.5–3.0 mmol/L suggest the diagnosis or the level at which an urgent medical review should be obtained.

Blood testing for ketones has a greater sensitivity and specificity for DKA than urine testing. A blood sample is usually readily available, and because it provides a measurement quickly, it minimizes delays in diagnosis. Although ketone meters may vary in their accuracy depending on their manufacturer, these devices generally represent mature technology. Many combine blood glucose and ketone testing, which means that a person is not required to carry an additional device. Conversely, ketone meters and their blood strips are expensive, ketone strips have a short shelf-life of typically 12 months, and testing is painful and involves blood exposure. As with urine ketone measurements, interfering substances may impact specificity.

- **Real-world experience with ketone testing options**: Although there is evidence that continuous glucose monitor (CGM) provision has resulted in a reduction in DKA, this is probably because insulin has been administered.

### Prolonged glucosuria and relapse of diabetic ketoacidosis related to SGLT2-inhibitor therapy [^1141ZnRR]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

SGLT2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) are glucose-lowering medications that increase the renal threshold for glucose reabsorption and promote glucosuria. Treatment with these agents raises serum ketone levels, and cases of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) during therapy have been reported. The duration of glucosuria and the inpatient course of SGLT2i-related DKA, however, are not well-characterized. We report 11 inpatient cases of SGLT2i-related DKA, including a subset of patients who experienced prolonged glucosuria and relapse of DKA during their hospitalization.

### Farxiga [^112adUHE]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Consider ketone monitoring in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and in others at risk for ketoacidosis if indicated by the clinical situation. Assess for ketoacidosis regardless of presenting blood glucose levels in patients who present with signs and symptoms consistent with severe metabolic acidosis. If ketoacidosis is suspected, discontinue Farxiga, promptly evaluate, and treat ketoacidosis if confirmed. Monitor patients for resolution of ketoacidosis before restarting Farxiga.

Withhold Farxiga, if possible, in temporary clinical situations that could predispose patients to ketoacidosis. Resume Farxiga when the patient is clinically stable and has resumed oral intake [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

Educate all patients on the signs and symptoms of ketoacidosis and instruct them to discontinue Farxiga and seek medical attention immediately if signs and symptoms occur.

- **Volume depletion**: Farxiga can cause intravascular volume depletion, which may sometimes manifest as symptomatic hypotension or acute transient changes in creatinine. There have been post-marketing reports of acute kidney injury, some requiring hospitalization and dialysis, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including Farxiga. Patients with impaired renal function (eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m²), elderly patients, or patients on loop diuretics may be at increased risk for volume depletion or hypotension. Before initiating Farxiga in patients with one or more of these characteristics, assess volume status and renal function.

### Exploring the clinical utility of blood ketone levels in the emergency department assessment of paediatric patients [^114mDkrT]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Ketonuria (on standard urine testing) is a frequent finding in children presenting to emergency departments. With the advent of hand-held ketone meters, blood ketone levels can now be rapidly quantified.

- **Hypothesis**: Point of care testing (POCT) of blood ketone levels could provide clinically useful information on the severity of illness in children and the risk of hospital admission.

- **Methods**: A prospective study using POCT of blood ketone levels was conducted on a convenience sample of children. A blood ketone level of 1.2 mmol/l has a positive predictive value of 66.7% for admission. Ketone levels correlated well with decreased oral intake (R² = 0.25; p < 0.001).

- **Conclusions**: A strong association was found between ketone levels, decreased oral intake, and fever. Although ketone levels do not correlate well with more traditional markers of illness severity, they can help identify potential cases for hospital admission.

### Illnesses associated with ketosis including diabetic ketoacidosis during very low carbohydrate and ketogenic diets [^113uR6k1]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

When an SGLT2‐inhibitor is added to a VLCKD, the number needed to harm (NNH) for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is 260, and when an SGLT2‐inhibitor is added or used before transitioning to a VLCKD, it is 223. The NNH for illness associated with ketosis (IAK), based on person‐days of exposure to SGLT2‐inhibitor in a VLCKD, is 33,597, meaning that for every 33,597 person‐days of exposure to SGLT2‐inhibitor while on a VLCKD, one additional IAK event is expected to occur compared to those not exposed to SGLT2-inhibitor.

The NNH for DKA cases, when the SGLT2‐inhibitor is used in conjunction with VLCKD or when exposure to SGLT2‐inhibitor occurs just before or during VLCKD, is slightly higher, around 308 to 313. The NNH based on person‐days of exposure to SGLT2‐inhibitor in a VLCKD is 37,709. The NNH for IAK and adjudicated DKA events was slightly lower in those exposed to SGLT2‐inhibitor during or just before VLCKD. This correlates with when these adjudicated DKA events were reported, where approximately 40% were reported within 90 days of enrollment, with the median program days of DKA events being 125 days. Likely, these events happened early in the dietary changes, especially among those taking SGLT2‐inhibitor at enrollment.

### The effectiveness of blood glucose and blood ketone measurement in identifying significant acidosis in diabetic ketoacidosis patients [^116MTGQQ]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2023). Low credibility.

Patients with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a potentially fatal complication of type 1 diabetes, have hyperglycemia, ketonemia, and metabolic acidosis. Blood glucose and blood ketone results are often used to triage patients with suspected DKA. This study aimed to establish how effective blood glucose and blood ketone (beta-hydroxybutyrate, BOHB) measurements are in identifying patients with significant acidosis and sought to validate existing diagnostic BOHB thresholds.

- **Methods**: Initial Emergency Department results on 161 presumptive DKA episodes in 95 patients (42 female, 53 male, age range 14–89 years) containing a complete dataset of glucose (D), BOHB (K), and bicarbonate [HCO3] and pH (A) results.

- **Results**: Blood glucose correlated poorly with BOHB (r = 0.28, p = 0.0003), pH (r = -0.25, p = 0.002), and HCO3 (r = -0.17, p = 0.04). BOHB, though better, was still limited in predicting pH (r = -0.44, p < 0.0001). Notably, among patients with normal values, eight were normoglycemic (≤ 13.9 mmol/L), nine were ketonemic (≤ 3 mmol/L), and five had either.

- **Conclusions**: The commonly employed BOHB diagnostic cutoff of 3 mmol/L could not be verified. Since acid-base status was poorly predicted by both glucose and BOHB, pH and/or HCO3 should also be tested in any patient suspected of DKA.

### Comparisons of biochemical parameters and diabetic ketoacidosis severity in adult patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes [^1166byoJ]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Low credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a life-threatening acute complication of diabetes mellitus characterized by hyperglycemia and ketoacidosis. It can occur in both type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes patients under stress conditions such as infection, surgery, and trauma or under administration of SGLT2 inhibitors. The mortality rate for patients with DKA is about 1% and the rate rises to 5% in elderly patients. Multiple studies of DKA have been carried out in Caucasian populations, mainly with type 1 diabetes. However, a significant proportion of DKA in Asian populations occurs in type 2 diabetes, and it is unclear if the clinical courses of DKA in type 1 and type 2 diabetes in Asian populations differ.

The severity of DKA is generally classified as mild, moderate, or severe according to the American Diabetes Association. However, variations in the criteria exist among different professional societies. It should be noted that the severity criteria for DKA were mainly derived in Western countries, and that it remains unclear whether the criteria are appropriate for Asian populations and whether the severity of DKA is associated with clinical characteristics, biochemical derangements, and outcomes in Asian populations. Furthermore, it is currently unknown whether the severity of DKA based on clinical and biochemical parameters differs in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.

Laboratory findings in DKA consist of hyperglycemia (> 250 mg/dL), high anion gap metabolic acidosis, and the detection of serum ketone or urine ketone bodies. Three types of ketone bodies, acetoacetate…

### Profound hypokalemia associated with severe diabetic ketoacidosis [^112dNQdX]. Pediatric Diabetes (2016). Low credibility.

Hypokalemia is common during the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA); however, severe hypokalemia at presentation prior to insulin treatment is exceedingly uncommon. A previously healthy 8-year-old female presented with new onset type 1 diabetes mellitus, severe DKA (pH = 6.98), and profound hypokalemia (serum K = 1.3 mmol/L) accompanied by cardiac dysrhythmia. Insulin therapy was delayed for 9 hours to allow replenishment of potassium to safe serum levels. Meticulous intensive care management resulted in complete recovery. This case highlights the importance of measuring serum potassium levels prior to initiating insulin therapy in DKA, judicious fluid and electrolyte management, as well as delaying and/or reducing insulin infusion rates in the setting of severe hypokalemia.

### Prolonged glucosuria and relapse of diabetic ketoacidosis related to SGLT2-inhibitor therapy [^111nn3Px]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

SGLT2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) are glucose-lowering medications that increase the renal threshold for glucose reabsorption and promote glucosuria. Treatment with these agents raises serum ketone levels, and cases of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) during therapy have been reported. The duration of glucosuria and inpatient course of SGLT2i-related DKA, however, is not well-characterized. We report 11 inpatient cases of SGLT2i-related DKA, including a subset of patients who experienced prolonged glucosuria and relapse of DKA during their hospitalization.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis [^111itEwi]. Nature Reviews. Disease Primers (2020). Low credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is the most common acute hyperglycemic emergency in people with diabetes mellitus. A diagnosis of DKA is confirmed when all three of the following criteria are present: 'D', either elevated blood glucose levels or a family history of diabetes mellitus; 'K', the presence of high urinary or blood ketoacids; and 'A', a high anion gap metabolic acidosis. Early diagnosis and management are paramount to improve patient outcomes.

The mainstays of treatment include the restoration of circulating volume, insulin therapy, electrolyte replacement, and treatment of any underlying precipitating event. Without optimal treatment, DKA remains a condition with appreciable, although largely preventable, morbidity and mortality. In this primer, we discuss the epidemiology, pathogenesis, risk factors, and diagnosis of DKA and provide practical recommendations for the management of DKA in adults and children.

### Clinical features and outcomes of diabetic ketoacidosis in patients using SGLT2 inhibitors: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112iSFJA]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

A total of 1985 records were retrieved from the three databases, and one additional article was retrieved through a manual search (Figure S1). After removing 757 duplicate entries, 1229 studies remained for screening, and 1137 were excluded based on the initial title and abstract screening. Among the 92 studies selected for full-text review, 83 were excluded for the following reasons: non-original research (n = 20), case reports on SGLT2i-induced DKA (n = 6), studies exclusively investigating SGLT2i without non-users (n = 22), and comparative studies on DKA incidence between SGLT2i users and non-users (n = 35). Ultimately, nine studies were included in the meta-analysis.

### Diagnostic accuracy of point-of-care testing for diabetic ketoacidosis at emergency-department triage: β-hydroxybutyrate versus the urine dipstick [^115AoRxm]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Rapid and accurate identification of patients with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is critical but complicated by the fact that DKA only affects a small percentage of the total number of patients with hyperglycemia. Clinical practice in the emergency department is to screen hyperglycemic patients with a urine dipstick for ketones and conduct a laboratory evaluation for DKA on patients whose results screen positive. Although the urine dipstick is easily accessible, inexpensive, rapid, and has excellent sensitivity for DKA, its poor specificity (estimated at < 50%) results in a large number of false-positive tests and unnecessary work-ups. This has led the American Diabetes Association (ADA) to discourage using the urine dipstick and encourage the use of serum ketones for DKA screening. The development of point-of-care β-hydroxybutyrate (β-OHB) devices has made following these ADA recommendations feasible in the emergency department. The goal of this prospective study was to compare the test characteristics of a point-of-care β-OHB meter with the urine dipstick for screening for DKA at emergency-department triage.

### Capillary ketone level and future ketoacidosis risk in patients with type 1 diabetes using sodium-glucose cotransporter inhibitors [^1158sRrT]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

We aimed to determine if routine capillary blood ketone testing on well days predicts future diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in type 1 diabetes (T1D) using sodium-glucose cotransporter inhibitors (SGLTi).

- **Research design and methods**: We examined previously collected data from empagliflozin-assigned participants in a T1D trial that included weekly fasted ketone levels. Over 6–12 months, ketone levels were subdivided into 28-day periods, and the outcome was subsequent adjudicated DKA or severe ketosis.

- **Results**: Among 1,194 participants, 325 had 49 DKA and 568 severe ketosis events. On-treatment maximum ketone levels were higher in the 28 days before an outcome compared with levels in those without an outcome, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.76 (95% CI 0.71–0.82). Maximum ketone level ≥ 0.8 mmol/L had a sensitivity of 66.0%, specificity of 79.6%, and diagnostic odds ratio of 7.6.

- **Conclusions**: Routine surveillance of capillary ketone levels in T1D using SGLTi may represent a DKA mitigation strategy and implies a potential threshold for continuous ketone monitoring.

### Continuous ketone monitoring: Exciting implications for clinical practice [^116VWAMQ]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

Should an alert inform a person that ketosis is developing, we recommend that a response algorithm based on a modification of the STICH (STop, Inject, Carbohydrate and Hydrate) protocol be followed to pre-empt DKA risk. The key steps involved in this protocol include: (i) verifying ketosis and identifying conditions that cause ketosis; (ii) stopping the SGLTinh, injecting bolus insulin, consuming 30 g of carbohydrate, and hydrating; (iii) monitoring ketone levels every 1–2 hours; and (iv) seeking medical care (such as presenting to the emergency department if ketones persist at > 2.5 mmol/L) if ketosis does not resolve or if symptoms of DKA appear, such as abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. At any elevated CKM level, before taking any further action, it is recommended that the individual checks their ketones with a capillary blood reading using a blood ketone meter. Conversely, should a person experience any symptoms of ketosis despite the CKM indicating normal levels, confirmation with a blood ketone measurement is strongly recommended. However, an evidence base providing details of the optimum responses to minimize the risk of DKA is urgently needed.

### Evaluation and management of the critically ill adult with diabetic ketoacidosis [^113gT6Kk]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a hyperglycemic emergency that frequently presents to the emergency department. Severe DKA poses a risk of significant morbidity and mortality if not recognized early and treated appropriately. It is incumbent on emergency clinicians to be vigilant in managing these critically ill patients.

- **Objective**: This narrative review evaluates the emergency medicine management of adult patients with severe DKA.

- **Discussion**: DKA is most commonly found in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes, often due to nonadherence to diabetic medications or an inciting event such as infection or ischemia. The severity of DKA is classified based on the level of acidosis present rather than the absolute glucose level. Managing severe DKA involves assessing and treating the inciting event, fluid hydration, insulin administration, and potassium repletion. Close monitoring is necessary to prevent complications that can occur.

- **Conclusions**: DKA is a medical condition with the potential for significant morbidity and mortality if not recognized and managed appropriately.

### Synjardy [^112B6qW7]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The signs and symptoms of serious conditions associated with the use of Synjardy, such as dehydration and severe metabolic acidosis, include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, generalized malaise, and shortness of breath. Blood glucose levels at presentation may be below those typically expected for diabetic ketoacidosis (e.g. less than 250 mg/dL). It is noted that ketoacidosis and glucosuria may persist longer than usually expected. Urinary glucose excretion can continue for three days after discontinuing Synjardy or Synjardy XR; however, postmarketing reports indicate that ketoacidosis and/or glucosuria can last longer than six days, and in some cases, up to two weeks after the discontinuation of SGLT2 inhibitors.

Consider ketone monitoring in patients at risk for ketoacidosis if the clinical situation dictates. Assess for ketoacidosis regardless of presenting blood glucose levels in patients who present with signs and symptoms indicative of severe metabolic acidosis. If ketoacidosis is suspected, discontinue Synjardy or Synjardy XR, promptly evaluate, and treat if confirmed. Monitor patients for the resolution of ketoacidosis before restarting Synjardy or Synjardy XR.

Withhold Synjardy or Synjardy XR, if possible, in temporary clinical situations that could predispose patients to ketoacidosis. Resume Synjardy or Synjardy XR when the patient is clinically stable and has resumed oral intake.

Educate all patients on the signs and symptoms of ketoacidosis. Instruct patients to discontinue Synjardy or Synjardy XR and seek medical attention immediately if they experience these signs and symptoms.

### Utility of ketone measurement in the prevention, diagnosis and management of diabetic ketoacidosis [^113oCyb2]. Diabetic Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Ketone measurement is advocated for the diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis and assessment of its severity. Assessing the evidence base for ketone measurement in clinical practice is challenging because multiple methods are available, but there is a lack of consensus about which is preferable. Evaluating the utility of ketone measurement is additionally problematic because of variability in the biochemical definition of ketoacidosis internationally and in the proposed thresholds for ketone measures. This has led to conflicting guidance from expert bodies on how ketone measurement should be used in the management of ketoacidosis.

The development of point-of-care devices that can reliably measure the capillary blood ketone β-hydroxybutyrate (BOHB) has widened the spectrum of applications of ketone measurement. However, whether the evidence base supporting these applications is robust enough to warrant their incorporation into routine clinical practice remains unclear. The imprecision of capillary blood ketone measures at higher values, the lack of availability of routine laboratory-based assays for BOHB, and the continued cost-effectiveness of urine ketone assessment prompt further discussion on the role of capillary blood ketone assessment in ketoacidosis.

In the present article, we review the various existing methods of ketone measurement, the precision of capillary blood ketone as compared with other measures, its diagnostic accuracy in predicting ketoacidosis, and other clinical applications including prevention, assessment of severity, and resolution of ketoacidosis.

### Feasibility of continuous ketone monitoring in subcutaneous tissue using a ketone sensor [^111yp3sg]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2021). Low credibility.

Measuring urine or blood ketone levels using a strip-based technology has its limitations. It provides episodic information that confirms an already ongoing ketosis or DKA event. Early identification of ketone production may warn of impending ketoacidosis, which could reduce the complications of DKA and perhaps even prevent it. Real-time continuous ketone monitoring could also help clinicians manage ketoacidosis. For individuals on low carbohydrate diets, the sensor may serve as a tool to monitor the effectiveness of their diet and indicate the effect of diet or exercise on ketone levels.

Blood ketone test strips typically have a measurement range of 0–8 mM. The appropriate measurement range for a ketone sensor is to be determined based on its use scenario. The in vitro performance of the sensor has been demonstrated up to 8 mM, showing that the sensor responds linearly to changes in the concentration of ketone and with minimal variation between sensors. In an in vitro setting, the sensor responds to changes in the ketone concentration quickly, with a response time of less than 4 minutes across a measurement range.

Unlike glucose, the baseline ketone levels are typically very low, and calibrating the sensor at these concentration levels may not be effective. Therefore, operational stability is critical for a ketone sensor. Achieving operational stability for over 14 days for a NAD+ dependent chemistry is even more challenging, as NAD+ is a free molecule and difficult to be retained in the sensing chemistry.

### Jardiance [^114mmSiF]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Consider ketone monitoring in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and others at risk for ketoacidosis if indicated by the clinical situation. Assess for ketoacidosis regardless of presenting blood glucose levels in patients who show signs and symptoms consistent with severe metabolic acidosis. If ketoacidosis is suspected, discontinue Jardiance, promptly evaluate, and treat ketoacidosis if confirmed. Monitor patients for resolution of ketoacidosis before restarting Jardiance.

Withhold Jardiance, if possible, in temporary clinical situations that could predispose patients to ketoacidosis. Resume Jardiance when the patient is clinically stable and has resumed oral intake [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

Educate all patients on the signs and symptoms of ketoacidosis, and instruct them to discontinue Jardiance and seek medical attention immediately if signs and symptoms occur.

- **Volume depletion**: Jardiance can cause intravascular volume depletion, which may sometimes manifest as symptomatic hypotension or acute transient changes in creatinine [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. There have been post-marketing reports of acute kidney injury, some requiring hospitalization and dialysis, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including Jardiance. Patients with impaired renal function (eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m²), elderly patients, or those on loop diuretics may be at increased risk for volume depletion or hypotension.

### Continuous ketone monitoring: Exciting implications for clinical practice [^116414cU]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

Breath-based ketone testing

Although not widely available clinically, ketones can also be measured by breath testing. The predominant ketone measured is acetone, which is volatile and exhaled. Advantages include the painless assessment of ketone levels with no necessity for blood exposure or urine collection. Additionally, changes in acetone are dynamic and may provide an early signal of change in a person's metabolic state. Conversely, breath ketone meters are expensive; the test needs to be user-initiated, and the person is required to carry an additional device. A proof-of-concept study evaluating a breath ketone analyser (Ketonix, Varberg, Sweden) in 10 adults and nine children with type 1 diabetes (T1D) concluded that the device could be used to rule out ketosis in adults but not in children. However, in general, there is a lack of an evidence base for the accuracy and dynamic range of these devices for those with T1D because they have generally been developed for those pursuing ketogenic diets instead of for medical use.

### The effectiveness of blood glucose and blood ketone measurement in identifying significant acidosis in diabetic ketoacidosis patients [^1112kAyE]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2023). High credibility.

Patients with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a potentially fatal complication of type 1 diabetes, present with hyperglycemia, ketonemia, and metabolic acidosis. Blood glucose and blood ketone results are often used to triage patients with suspected DKA. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of blood glucose and blood ketone (beta-hydroxybutyrate, BOHB) measurements in identifying patients with significant acidosis and sought to validate existing diagnostic BOHB thresholds.

- **Methods**: Initial Emergency Department results were gathered on 161 presumptive DKA episodes in 95 patients (42 females, 53 males, age range 14–89 years) comprising a complete dataset of D (glucose), K (BOHB), and A (Bicarbonate [HCO3] and pH) results.

- **Results**: Blood glucose showed a poor correlation with BOHB (r = 0.28, p = 0.0003), pH (r = -0.25, p = 0.002), and HCO3 (r = -0.17, p = 0.04). BOHB, while better, was still limited in predicting pH (r = -0.44, p < 0.0001) and HCO3 (r = -0.52, p < 0.0001). The efficacy of a BOHB cutoff greater than 3mmol/L was limited by falsely non-acidotic (pH > 7.30, HCO3 > 13.9mmol/L, n = 8), ketonemic (≤ 3mmol/L, n = 9), or either (n = 5) cases.

- **Conclusions**: The commonly employed BOHB diagnostic cutoff of 3mmol/L could not be verified. Since acid-base status was poorly predicted by both glucose and BOHB, it is recommended that pH and/or HCO3 should also be tested in any patient suspected of DKA, regardless of the results.

### Diagnostic accuracy of point-of-care testing for diabetic ketoacidosis at emergency-department triage: {beta}-hydroxybutyrate versus the urine dipstick [^115HMYb6]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

This prospective, observational study was conducted at a large, urban emergency department. Institutional review board approval was obtained, and study participants provided written informed consent. The cohort studied represents a convenience sample of emergency department patients with triage capillary blood glucose ≥ 250 mg/dL, enrolled on 320 individual days over a 2-year period based on research assistant availability. Subjects were excluded if they were critically ill, in police custody, suffering from acute psychosis, or unable to give informed consent.

Included patients had a urine dipstick (Siemens Multistix 10SG) for ketones, recorded as positive or negative, a serum chemistry panel, a venous blood gas to determine serum pH, and a point-of-care capillary β-OHB measurement (Precision Xtra meter; Medisense/Abbott Laboratories). DKA was defined according to the following ADA criteria: serum glucose ≥ 250 mg/dL, anion gap > 10 mmol/L, carbon dioxide ≤ 18 mmol/L, and pH ≤ 7.30. The subjects' race, ethnicity, age, sex, previous history of diabetes, and insulin use were recorded.

On the basis of previous literature, we assumed that the true sensitivity of β-OHB for detecting DKA was between 98% and 100% and determined that a sample including 54 cases of DKA would confirm this point estimate with a confidence limit no lower than 90%. The study was stopped after the 54th DKA patient was enrolled.

Data were analyzed using Stata version 10.0.

### Relationship between bedside ketone levels and time to resolution of diabetic ketoacidosis: A retrospective cohort study [^117HEm7Y]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Low credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is caused by relative or absolute insulin deficiency and is characterized clinically by hyperglycemia, metabolic acidosis, and ketonemia. DKA is frequently encountered in daily clinical practice, both in newly diagnosed cases (up to 70%) and in patients with established type 1 diabetes (T1D) (rate, 1–10% per case per year). Common risk factors for DKA include a new diagnosis of T1D, young children, adolescent female patients, delayed T1D diagnosis, insulin omission, poor treatment on a sick day, accessibility to hospitals, and insulin pump injection errors.

DKA is one of the most severe and sometimes life-threatening acute complications; therefore, establishing a standard treatment protocol is necessary to prevent further complications. There are currently only a few established treatment regimens for DKA treatment. For example, the International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes recently released consensus guidelines for DKA; however, the guidelines cited only a few solid evidence-based treatment protocols for pediatric patients. Surprisingly, the time to DKA resolution (time between the start of treatment and resolution of DKA) remains ill-defined. DKA resolution is generally judged comprehensively based on clinical signs, such as the ability to eat/drink, and a few non-specific biomarkers, such as the blood pH value. Of these biomarkers, the Joint British Diabetes Societies recommended using bedside measurement of serum 3-hydroxybutyrate (3HB) to monitor the response to DKA treatment.

### Diagnostic accuracy of point-of-care testing for diabetic ketoacidosis at emergency-department triage: {beta}-hydroxybutyrate versus the urine dipstick [^111XbVN8]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Approximately one-fourth of emergency-department patients have diabetes, and almost half have poor glycemic control. Common clinical practice is to consider the diagnosis of DKA in all patients presenting with blood glucose ≥ 250 mg/dL, regardless of the reason for the visit. Due to emergency-department overcrowding stretching resources to the breaking point, there is an increasing emphasis on developing, testing, and using the most rapid, accurate, and easy-to-use DKA screening tool available. The results of this study show that the specificity of capillary point-of-care β-OHB is superior to the urine dipstick.

Two retrospective studies have shown that capillary point-of-care β-OHB is 100% sensitive for DKA. Charles et al. likewise found that β-OHB was 100% sensitive in a prospective study of seven DKA patients. Naunheim et al. reported a β-OHB sensitivity for DKA of 98% in a prospective sample of 160 patients (57 with DKA). Our study is the first to prospectively compare the test characteristics of point-of-care β-OHB against the urine dipstick in a cohort of emergency-department patients. Using β-OHB instead of the urine dipstick to screen our sample could have reduced full laboratory work-ups for DKA by 56.9%.

Our study has several limitations. First, we did not provide specific training to the nurses who interpreted the urine dipsticks. We felt this was unnecessary because they: 1) are Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment certified, 2) are familiar with this process, and 3) perform it regularly.

### Emergency department presentations of diabetic ketoacidosis in a large cohort of children [^113Axuwp]. Pediatric Diabetes (2023). Low credibility.

- **Data collection in the prospective FLUID trial**: Treating clinicians completed study case report forms that included clinical symptoms and diabetes history. Laboratory results were abstracted from the medical record. Caregivers of children enrolled in the FLUID trial completed surveys during the index hospitalization that included the caregiver's highest education achieved (categorized for analysis as high school/GED or less, some college/vocational school, college degree, or more), as well as annual household income (categorized for analysis as less than $40,000, $40,000–$99,999, and $100,000 or more).

- **Data collection for the retrospective cohort**: For the additional 378 DKA episodes included in the retrospective cohort but not in the FLUID trial, study teams completed structured medical record reviews using REDCap™ hosted by the PECARN data center at the University of Utah. Patient demographics and clinical factors were abstracted from the medical records. Caregiver education and annual household income were not available for this cohort.

- **DKA severity**: We defined DKA severity using the first venous pH obtained, applying standard definitions: mild (pH ≥ 7.2– < 7.25), moderate (pH ≥ 7.1– < 7.2), and severe (pH < 7.1). For children who did not have pH measured before starting treatment, we classified DKA severity according to the serum bicarbonate concentration as mild (bicarbonate ≥ 10), moderate (bicarbonate 5– < 10), and severe (bicarbonate < 5).

- **Initial laboratory results**: Initial laboratory results were defined as the earliest result measured at the participant's presentation.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis: A current appraisal of pathophysiology and management [^114HVCSn]. Clinical Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a frequent abnormal metabolic entity seen in high-dependency units such as critical care units and in the emergency department. Understanding its pathophysiology, a consequence of absent to low insulin levels, helps delineate the clinical presentation. Most clinical features are caused by hyperglycemia and acidosis, including weight loss. Newer management modalities are discussed, including the need for intensive laboratory workup and meticulous monitoring of insulin and fluid management. Among the complications, cerebral edema (CE) is the most dreaded, albeit with low incidence. New insights into its pathophysiology and management are outlined, and a timeline for management of DKA is proposed.

### When it is not just DKA; diabetic ketoacidosis as a first presentation of pancreatic adenocarcinoma [^112F9f5E]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States. Early symptoms of pancreatic cancer are nonspecific, and most cases are diagnosed at an advanced stage. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) as a first presentation of pancreatic adenocarcinoma is a seldom-reported condition.

We present a case of a 59-year-old female with type 2 diabetes who presented to the emergency department with confusion, abdominal pain, polyuria, and polydipsia. Laboratory workup showed a high anion gap metabolic acidosis and a blood glucose level of 419 mg/dl with positive serum ketones. She was diagnosed with DKA and admitted to the ICU.

A CT abdomen/pelvis was performed to assess for pancreatic pathology as her DKA took longer time to resolve; it showed a pancreatic mass with multiple lesions in the liver. She had biopsies done, which were positive for poorly differentiated pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. DKA occurs less commonly in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Common precipitating factors for DKA in type 2 diabetes include medication noncompliance, infection, or possibly treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors. DKA as a first presentation of pancreatic cancer has been reported more with endocrine islet cell tumors but rarely with adenocarcinoma of the exocrine pancreas.

Studies have shown that diabetes is an independent risk factor for the development of pancreatic cancer. Other studies suggested that diabetes might be a result of pancreatic cancer or a paraneoplastic effect. One study suggested that diabetes associated with pancreatic cancer occurs at a resectable stage of the disease.

### Prolonged glucosuria and relapse of diabetic ketoacidosis related to SGLT2-inhibitor therapy [^116JHDXY]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

It is essential that inpatient therapy for SGLT2i-related DKA focuses on providing adequate insulin and dextrose independent of serum glucose concentrations, given ongoing glucosuria despite the resolution of metabolic acidosis. Monitoring urine glucose concentration may also assist in the risk assessment for DKA relapse in this setting. A larger, prospective multicenter study comparing patients with DKA on SGLT2i to a control group of DKA without SGLT2i, which closely monitors urine glucose concentrations and other relevant clinical factors, is necessary to define recommended monitoring and management strategies. Guidelines for the treatment of SGLT2i-related DKA should recognize that patient characteristics and the course may differ from classical DKA, requiring vigilance to prevent relapse and extended hospitalization.

### Continuous ketone monitoring: Exciting implications for clinical practice [^116bcBjA]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

Urine testing for ketones is a method that has been available for a long time. It is relatively inexpensive and painless, does not require the user to carry a meter, and involves minimal technical skill to implement. However, many patients prefer to avoid doing urine tests. The color-coded, strip-based test uses a nitroprusside reaction, which provides a semiquantitative measure of acetoacetate and, with some brands, acetone. The test represents an average of ketones excreted in the urine since the last void, which may delay recognition of impending diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or its resolution.

Importantly, with treatment, the circulating pool of β-hydroxybutyrate is oxidized to acetoacetate, which may cause urine ketone readings to rise while blood β-hydroxybutyrate concentrations are falling. This paradoxical increase in urinary acetoacetate gives the false impression that the condition is not improving. In addition, acetoacetate accounts for approximately only 20% of circulating ketone bodies, impacting the sensitivity of urine testing. False positive results can result from highly pigmented urine and interfering substances, including levodopa and drugs that are present in the blood and/or excreted in the urine as free-sulphydryl compounds.

Finally, it requires the person to recognize an increased risk of DKA to then initiate testing. This may be difficult because of oliguria from dehydration and acute renal failure or in the absence of a private environment where a urine sample may be obtained.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis [^116dywr1]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

A diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis requires the patient's plasma glucose concentration to be above 250 mg per dL (although it is usually much higher), the pH level to be less than 7.30, and the bicarbonate level to be 18 mEq per L or less. Beta-hydroxybutyrate is a better measurement of the degree of ketosis than serum ketones. Intravenous insulin and fluid replacement are the mainstays of therapy, with careful monitoring of potassium levels. Phosphorous and magnesium may also need to be replaced. Bicarbonate therapy is rarely needed. Infection, insulin omission, and other problems that may have precipitated ketoacidosis should be treated. Myocardial infarction is a precipitating cause of diabetic ketoacidosis that is especially important to look for in older patients with diabetes. Cerebral edema is a major complication that occurs primarily in children. Education to prevent recurrence should be offered to all patients, including how to manage sick days and when to call a physician.

### Diagnostic accuracy of point-of-care testing for diabetic ketoacidosis at emergency-department triage: {beta}-hydroxybutyrate versus the urine dipstick [^117PnUxn]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

In the emergency department, hyperglycemic patients are screened for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) via a urine dipstick. In this prospective study, we compared the test characteristics of point-of-care β-hydroxybutyrate (β-OHB) analysis with the urine dipstick.

- **Research design and methods**: Emergency-department patients with blood glucose levels ≥ 250 mg/dL had urine dipstick, chemistry panel, venous blood gas, and capillary β-OHB measurements. DKA was diagnosed according to American Diabetes Association criteria.

- **Results**: Of 516 hyperglycemic subjects, 54 were diagnosed with DKA. The urine dipstick demonstrated a sensitivity of 98.1% (95% CI 90.1–100), a specificity of 35.1% (30.7–39.6), a positive predictive value of 15% (11.5–19.2), and a negative predictive value of 99.4% (96.6–100) for DKA. Using the manufacturer-suggested cutoff of > 1.5 mmol/L, β-OHB had a sensitivity of 98.1% (90.1–100), a specificity of 78.6% (74.5–82.2), a positive predictive value of 34.9% (27.3–43), and a negative predictive value of 99.7% (98.5–100) for DKA.

- **Conclusions**: Point-of-care β-OHB and the urine dipstick are equally sensitive for detecting DKA (98.1%). However, β-OHB is more specific (78.6% vs. 35.1%), offering the potential to significantly reduce unnecessary DKA work-ups among hyperglycemic patients in the emergency department.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis masquerading behind alkalemia an undiagnosed or missed variant of diabetic ketoacidosis [^116d5q2M]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis is a common emergency in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. However, in rare cases, patients may present with alkalemia instead of acidosis. Diabetic ketoalkalosis, previously reported in adults, can also occur in children with type 1 DM. In the cases studied, the usual factors causing alkalemia were not found, indicating that this condition can manifest in both newly diagnosed and treated patients.

- **Case presentation**: The first patient, an 8-year-old male, presented with features of DKA and was diagnosed for the first time as having type 1 DM, but was found to have alkalemia. The second patient, a 7-year-old female, was a known case of type 1 DM on insulin, who presented with dehydration and alkalemia. Both patients were treated with hydration and insulin and made a complete recovery.

A normal or alkalotic pH does not necessarily eliminate the possibility of DKA and requires further evaluation to identify the underlying acid-base disturbance.

### Guidelines and recommendations for laboratory analysis in the diagnosis and management of diabetes mellitus [^113eLXyY]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

- **Urine ketones**:

	- **Preanalytical**: The concentrations of ketones in the urine of healthy individuals are below the detection limits of commercially available testing materials. False-positive results have been reported with highly colored urine and in the presence of several sulfhydryl-containing drugs, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Urine test reagents deteriorate with exposure to air, giving false-negative readings; therefore, testing material should be stored in tightly sealed containers and discarded after the expiration date on the manufacturer's label. False-negative readings have also been reported with highly acidic urine samples, such as after large intakes of ascorbic acid. The loss of ketones from urine attributable to microbial action can also cause false-negative readings. Because acetone is a highly volatile substance, samples should be kept in a closed container. For point-of-care analyses in medical facilities and for patients in the home setting, control materials (that give both negative and positive readings) are not commercially available but would be desirable to ensure the accuracy of test results.

	- **Analytical**: Several assay principles have been described. Most commonly used is the colorimetric reaction that occurs between AcAc and nitroprusside (sodium nitroferricyanide) to produce a purple color. This method is widely available in the form of dipsticks and tablets and is used to measure ketones in both the urine and blood (either serum or plasma). Several manufacturers offer dipsticks for measuring glucose and ketones.

### Non-diabetic ketoacidosis: A case of alcoholic ketoacidosis accompanied by hyperglycemia [^1134prJU]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Alcoholic ketoacidosis (AKA) lacks a specific clinical presentation. Blood tests commonly reveal hemoconcentration, elevated β-hydroxybutyrate levels, and acidosis in patients with AKA. Here, we report a case of AKA accompanied by hyperglycemia and review the related literature.

- **Case report**: AKA associated with hyperglycemia is rare, and its pathogenesis resembles diabetic ketoacidosis, making differentiation challenging. AKA is often misdiagnosed by endocrinologists. The main symptoms of a 37-year-old female included hyperglycemia, elevated β-hydroxybutyrate levels, and metabolic acidosis. Her primary clinical presentations were severe nausea and vomiting. Initially diagnosed with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), she was eventually confirmed to have AKA and recovered after active therapy involving rehydration and correction of hyperglycemia, electrolyte imbalance, and ketosis.

This study provides a reference for clinicians to reduce missed diagnoses and misdiagnosis rates of AKA.

### The evaluation and management of pediatric diabetic ketoacidosis: A comprehensive review [^1168HEhM]. Clinical Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a common and serious acute complication in children with diabetes mellitus (DM). DKA can accompany new-onset type 1 insulin-dependent DM or occur with established type 1 DM during the increased demands of an acute illness or due to decreased insulin delivery from omitted doses or insulin pump failure. Additionally, DKA episodes in children with type 2 DM are being reported with greater frequency. Although the diagnosis is usually straightforward in known diabetes patients with expected findings, a sizable proportion of patients with new-onset DM present with DKA. This comprehensive review aims to acquaint clinicians with details regarding the pathophysiology, treatment caveats, and potential complications of DKA.

### Point-of-care capillary blood ketone measurements and the prediction of future ketoacidosis risk in type 1 diabetes [^116oyT6h]. Diabetes Care (2023). High credibility.

Objective

We aimed to determine if levels of routine point-of-care capillary blood ketones could predict future diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) rather than during illness while DKA is developing.

Research design and methods

We examined previously collected data from placebo-assigned participants in an adjunct-to-insulin medication trial program. This program included the measurement of fasted capillary blood ketone levels twice per week during a 2-month baseline period. The outcome was 6- to 12-month trial-adjudicated DKA.

Results

DKA events occurred in 12 of 484 participants at a median of 105 days (interquartile range 43, 199). Maximum ketone levels were higher in patient cases compared with control patients (0.8 [0.6, 1.2] vs. 0.3 [0.2, 0.7] mmol/L; P = 0.002) with a nonparametric area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.77 (95% CI 0.66–0.88). Ketone levels ≥ 0.8 mmol/L had a sensitivity of 64%, a specificity of 78%, and positive and negative likelihood ratios of 2.9 and 0.5, respectively.

Conclusions

This proof of concept that routine capillary ketone surveillance can identify individuals at high risk of future DKA implies a role for future technologies, including continuous ketone monitoring.

### Continuous ketone monitoring: Exciting implications for clinical practice [^116cdNdL]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

The standard management of established DKA has been extensively documented in international guidelines. The principles are volume replacement, correction of electrolyte abnormalities, provision of insulin, and addressing precipitating factors, all of which should occur in a hospital environment where the patient is closely monitored. Patients with DKA may range from early presenters who are mildly unwell and have rapid reversal of their metabolic disturbances, to late presenters who are severely unwell with marked disturbances in acid–base balance, volume status, and electrolyte abnormalities, requiring admission to an intensive care unit. Generally, early presentation with milder metabolic derangement is associated with lower mortality, faster recovery, and lower socioeconomic costs.

The first step in the prevention and management of DKA is recognition of the impending or established condition with a ketone measurement. The measurement of ketones requires that the person recognizes they are at an increased risk of DKA and proactively initiates a test to confirm the presence of elevated ketones. Symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and thirst occur late, and hyperglycemia, which is not invariably present, may not always prompt the person to check their ketone levels. Available options test for the presence of ketones in urine and blood samples.

### Hyperglycemic emergencies in adults [^116GY5Zs]. Canadian Journal of Diabetes (2018). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for diabetic ketoacidosis, specifically with respect to beta-hydroxybutyrate, the DC 2018 guidelines recommend considering point-of-care capillary β-hydroxybutyrate testing. This testing should be conducted in the hospital or outpatient setting to screen for DKA in patients with T1DM who have a capillary blood glucose level greater than 14 mmol/L.

### Continuous ketone monitoring: Exciting implications for clinical practice [^115XfTJk]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

To address the limitations associated with approaches to ketone testing, we propose the following criteria for the ideal ketone monitor:

- **Dynamic range**: An ideal ketone testing device would measure ketones over a relevant dynamic range, suggested as 0–10 mmol/L, with automated alerts eliminating the need for user-initiated measurements.
- **Precision**: Measurements must be precise, particularly at the lower range, to prevent false alerts and reduce alarm fatigue.
- **Display**: The display should be unobtrusive unless needed.
- **Integration**: Technology should integrate seamlessly with the user's glucose management system to eliminate the necessity of carrying an additional device. For instance, ketone levels and trend information could be presented on a smartphone or insulin pump screen.

Ideally, the device should minimize discomfort, as well as psychological, financial, and physical burdens on the user, while remaining reliable and durable. Furthermore, it may be beneficial, although not essential, to include instructions on the most appropriate responses to the information provided. Current methods of urine, blood, and breath ketone testing do not meet these criteria, indicating a need for alternative approaches.

### Inpefa [^117Nspjt]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Consider ketone monitoring in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and others at risk for ketoacidosis if indicated by the clinical situation. Assess for ketoacidosis in patients who present with signs and symptoms consistent with severe metabolic acidosis, regardless of presenting blood glucose levels. If ketoacidosis is suspected, discontinue Inpefa, promptly evaluate, and treat ketoacidosis if confirmed. Monitor patients for resolution of ketoacidosis before restarting Inpefa.

Withhold Inpefa, if possible, in temporary clinical situations that could predispose patients to ketoacidosis. Resume Inpefa when the patient is clinically stable and has resumed oral intake [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

Educate all patients on the signs and symptoms of ketoacidosis and instruct them to discontinue Inpefa and seek medical attention immediately if signs and symptoms occur.

- **Volume depletion**: Inpefa can cause intravascular volume depletion, which may sometimes manifest as symptomatic hypotension or acute transient changes in creatinine. There have been postmarketing reports of acute kidney injury, some requiring hospitalization and dialysis, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus receiving SGLT2 inhibitors. Patients with impaired renal function (eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m²), elderly patients, or patients on loop diuretics may be at increased risk for volume depletion or hypotension [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5, 8.6)].
