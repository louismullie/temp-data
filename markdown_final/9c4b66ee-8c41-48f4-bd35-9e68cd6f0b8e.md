## Question

Which cytochrome P450 enzyme metabolizes buprenorphine?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which cytochrome P450 enzyme metabolizes buprenorphine. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the specific metabolic reaction involved for buprenorphine. Then, I should verify which CYP isoform mediates that reaction in authoritative labeling. Next, I will check for any credible conflicting evidence about other CYP involvement and assess its weight. Finally, I will consider clinical implications (drug–drug interactions) to ensure the answer is practical and aligned with real-world data [^112akB1m] [^1127j4XP] [^112ocHcw] [^112uNbN7].

> Let me first confirm the specific reaction. Buprenorphine's key Phase I pathway is N-dealkylation to norbuprenorphine, and the primary enzyme mediating this step is CYP3A4 according to multiple FDA labels and pharmacokinetic sections, which consistently state "N-dealkylation is mediated primarily by CYP3A4" [^112akB1m] [^112ocHcw] [^1127j4XP] [^116TkQFz].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I should verify whether other CYP isoforms contribute in a clinically meaningful way. An older, lower-credibility review mentions CYP2C8 alongside CYP3A4, but this citation is dated and not corroborated by high-credibility labeling, which unanimously designates CYP3A4 as the primary enzyme for N-dealkylation; at most, non-3A4 pathways appear minor or inconsistently described across sources, so the weight of evidence supports CYP3A4 as the principal route [^113uwMGM] [^112akB1m] [^112uNbN7] [^115Dozfa].

> I need to ensure I separate Phase I P450 metabolism from Phase II pathways. Buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine also undergo glucuronidation (e.g. UGT1A1 and UGT2B7), but those are not P450 enzymes and are distinct from the CYP-mediated N-dealkylation step that the question targets, so they do not change the conclusion about the relevant CYP isoform [^112akB1m] [^115Dozfa] [^115iZYbE].

> Wait, let me double-check that real-world interaction data align with CYP3A4 being primary. Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors like ketoconazole increase buprenorphine exposure in transmucosal products, and protease inhibitors such as ritonavir raise buprenorphine AUC, while product labeling for long-acting buprenorphine advises monitoring when coadministered with CYP3A4 modulators, which fits the expectation if CYP3A4 drives N-dealkylation; some route-specific exceptions exist, such as transdermal formulations showing less pronounced effects in certain studies, but the overall DDI pattern still supports CYP3A4 as the key enzyme [^1118JuW8] [^115MngaU] [^112uNbN7].

> Bottom line: I should confirm the answer succinctly. The cytochrome P450 enzyme that primarily metabolizes buprenorphine is CYP3A4, which mediates the N-dealkylation of buprenorphine to norbuprenorphine [^112akB1m] [^112ocHcw].

---

The primary CYP enzyme responsible for buprenorphine metabolism is **CYP3A4** [^112akB1m], catalyzing N-dealkylation to norbuprenorphine [^1127j4XP]. Inhibitors of **CYP3A4** (e.g. ketoconazole [^1118JuW8], ritonavir [^115MngaU]) can increase buprenorphine levels [^1127j4XP] and risk of adverse effects, while **CYP3A4 inducers** (e.g. rifampin, carbamazepine [^112uNbN7]) can reduce efficacy; monitor patients and adjust doses as needed. The enzymes **CYP2C8** [^113uwMGM] and **CYP2D6** have minor roles, and genetic variability in **CYP3A4** [^113tAL6P] can affect exposure and response [^1169SxBr].

## Primary CYP enzyme involved in buprenorphine metabolism

The primary CYP enzyme responsible for buprenorphine metabolism is **CYP3A4** [^112akB1m], catalyzing N-dealkylation to norbuprenorphine [^1127j4XP]. Norbuprenorphine is further glucuronidated by UGT enzymes [^115iZYbE], mainly UGT2B7 and UGT1A1 [^115Dozfa].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting CYP3A4's role

Clinical evidence shows that **CYP3A4 inhibitors** (e.g. ketoconazole [^1118JuW8], ritonavir [^115MngaU]) increase buprenorphine exposure, while **CYP3A4 inducers** (e.g. rifampin, carbamazepine [^112uNbN7]) reduce it. A ketoconazole interaction study with BUTRANS showed no accumulation [^115dJMzT]; however, other data confirm **CYP3A4's** central role for transmucosal products [^1127j4XP].

---

## Secondary CYP enzymes involved

Among secondary CYP enzymes, **CYP2C8** plays a minor role in buprenorphine metabolism [^113uwMGM], while **CYP2D6** contributes minimally; buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine are weak CYP2D6 inhibitors in vitro, with limited clinical impact [^1127j4XP].

---

## Clinical implications of CYP3A4-mediated metabolism

### Drug-drug interactions

Inhibitors of **CYP3A4** increase buprenorphine levels [^1127j4XP] and the risk of sedation, respiratory depression, and overdose; monitor and consider dose reduction [^1118JuW8] [^115dJMzT]. In contrast, **CYP3A4 inducers** decrease buprenorphine levels and efficacy [^112uNbN7], risking withdrawal or relapse; monitor and consider dose increase.

---

### Genetic variability

Polymorphisms in **CYP3A4** [^113tAL6P] can alter enzyme activity and buprenorphine exposure, affecting efficacy and adverse effects [^114zXvP7]. Genetic testing may help identify patients at risk of altered metabolism and guide dosing [^112XZiVD].

---

The primary enzyme metabolizing buprenorphine to norbuprenorphine is **CYP3A4** [^112akB1m]; inhibitors increase exposure [^1118JuW8] and adverse effects, while inducers reduce efficacy [^112uNbN7]. **CYP2C8** [^113uwMGM] and **CYP2D6** have minor roles, and **CYP3A4** genetic variability can influence clinical response [^1169SxBr].

### Buprenorphine [^112akB1m]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Pharmacokinetics of buprenorphine involves several processes:

- **Absorption**: Plasma levels of buprenorphine increase with the sublingual dose of buprenorphine sublingual tablets. Despite wide inter-patient variability in sublingual absorption, within-subject variability remains low. Both Cmax and AUC of buprenorphine increase linearly with the dose range of 4 mg to 16 mg, although the increase is not directly dose-proportional.

- **Distribution**: Buprenorphine is approximately 96% protein-bound, primarily to alpha and beta globulin.

- **Elimination**:
	- **Metabolism**: Buprenorphine undergoes N-dealkylation to norbuprenorphine and glucuronidation. The N-dealkylation pathway is primarily mediated by CYP3A4. Norbuprenorphine, the major metabolite, can undergo further glucuronidation. Although norbuprenorphine binds opioid receptors in vitro, it is not known whether it contributes to the overall effect of buprenorphine sublingual tablets.

	- **Excretion**: A mass balance study of buprenorphine showed complete recovery of the radiolabel in urine (30%) and feces (69%) collected up to 11 days after dosing. Almost all of the dose was accounted for in terms of buprenorphine, norbuprenorphine, and two unidentified buprenorphine metabolites. In urine, most buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine were conjugated (buprenorphine, 1% free and 9.4% conjugated; norbuprenorphine, 2.7% free and 11% conjugated). In feces, almost all buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine were free (buprenorphine, 33% free and 5% conjugated; norbuprenorphine, 21% free).

### Belbuca [^1127j4XP]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Drug interaction studies**: Buprenorphine undergoes N-dealkylation mediated primarily by CYP3A4, so its metabolism can be inhibited by CYP3A4 inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7)]. The interaction of buprenorphine with all CYP3A4 inducers has not been studied.

- **CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors**: Buprenorphine has been found to be a CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 inhibitor, and its major metabolite, norbuprenorphine, has been found to be a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor with in vitro studies employing human liver microsomes. However, the relatively low plasma concentrations of buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine resulting from therapeutic doses are not expected to raise significant drug-drug interaction concerns.

Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) is involved in the metabolism of more drugs in clinical use than any other foreign compound-metabolizing enzyme in humans. Recently, increasing evidence has been found showing that variants in the CYP3A4 gene have functional significance and, in rare cases, lead to loss of activity, implying tremendous consequences for patients. This review article highlights the functional consequences of all CYP3A4 variants recognized by the Human Cytochrome P450 (CYP) Allele Nomenclature Database.

### Suboxone [^1118JuW8]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2010). Low credibility.

**Drug-drug interactions**: CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers: A pharmacokinetic interaction study of ketoconazole (400 mg/day), a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, in 12 patients stabilized on Suboxone [8 mg (n = 1) or 12 mg (n = 5) or 16 mg (n = 6)] resulted in increases in buprenorphine mean Cmax values (from 4.3 to 9.8, 6.3 to 14.4, and 9.0 to 17.1) and mean AUC values (from 30.9 to 46.9, 41.9 to 83.2, and 52.3 to 120), respectively. Subjects receiving Subutex or Suboxone should be closely monitored and may require dose reduction if inhibitors of CYP3A4 such as azole antifungal agents (e.g. ketoconazole), macrolide antibiotics (e.g. erythromycin), and HIV protease inhibitors (e.g. ritonavir, indinavir, and saquinavir) are co-administered. The interaction of buprenorphine with CYP3A4 inducers has not been investigated; therefore, it is recommended that patients receiving Subutex or Suboxone should be closely monitored if inducers of CYP3A4 (e.g. phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampicin) are co-administered (see warnings).

### Understanding buprenorphine for use in chronic pain: Expert opinion [^117VZkp2]. Pain Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Buprenorphine has a higher binding affinity but lower intrinsic activity at the µ-opioid receptor than full µ-opioid receptor agonists. It features a unique mechanism of action at other receptors, such as δ- and κ-opioid receptors and ORL1, which may contribute to analgesia and other favorable clinical properties.

- **When an opioid is considered for a patient with chronic pain, should buprenorphine be prescribed before a Schedule IV or Schedule II option?** Depending on the patient, buprenorphine may be more favorable for the management of chronic pain than a Schedule IV or II opioid. Compared with Schedule II prescriptions, such as fentanyl and oxycodone, Schedule III medications reduce some of the access barriers faced by patients, including refill options and the clinician's ability to call in prescriptions to the pharmacy.

For patients whose phenotypic profile is known, buprenorphine or other opioids undergoing exclusively Phase II metabolism may be more appropriate, especially for those who are phenotypic outliers (ultrarapid or poor metabolizers) in producing cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes that induce or inhibit the hepatic isoenzyme CYP2D6. This is in contrast to codeine (available as a Schedule III medication when combined with a nonopioid analgesic and/or atropine alkaloids) and certain Schedule IV opioids, such as tramadol. With tramadol, ultrarapid CYP2D6 metabolism may increase the risks of toxicity, including respiratory depression, whereas a poor CYP2D6 metabolizer may have limited analgesic benefit upon treatment with tramadol or codeine.

### Biased cytochrome P450-mediated metabolism via small-molecule ligands binding P450 oxidoreductase [^115xVUkt]. Nature Communications (2021). Low credibility.

Metabolic control is mediated by the dynamic assemblies and function of multiple redox enzymes. A key element in these assemblies, the P450 oxidoreductase (POR) donates electrons and selectively activates numerous (> 50 in humans and > 300 in plants) cytochromes P450 (CYPs), controlling metabolism of drugs, steroids, and xenobiotics in humans and natural product biosynthesis in plants. The mechanisms underlying POR-mediated CYP metabolism remain poorly understood, and at the time of writing, no ligand binding has been described to regulate the specificity of POR.

Here, using a combination of computational modeling and functional assays, we identify ligands that dock on POR and bias its specificity towards CYP redox partners across the mammal and plant kingdoms. Single molecule FRET studies reveal ligand binding to alter POR conformational sampling, resulting in biased activation of metabolic cascades in whole cell assays. We propose the model of biased metabolism, a mechanism akin to the biased signaling of GPCRs, where ligand binding on POR stabilizes different conformational states that are linked to distinct metabolic outcomes. Biased metabolism may allow designing pathway-specific therapeutics or personalized food to suppress undesired, disease-related metabolic pathways.

### Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic models as enablers of precision dosing in drug development: Pivotal role of the human mass balance study [^115iZYbE]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Low credibility.

- **Case study 1: Buprenorphine**: Neonatal abstinence syndrome, a condition affecting newborns exposed to an opioid in utero, is often treated with buprenorphine. Few pharmacokinetic studies of buprenorphine in children, particularly neonates, are available, as conducting clinical trials in this population is challenging. The availability of a high-fidelity PBPK model allows dosing strategies for buprenorphine in children to be assessed. As described previously, clearance routes (cytochrome P450 [CYP]–mediated and uridine diphosphate [UDP]-glucuronosyltransferase [UGT]–mediated metabolism and biliary clearance) were assigned based on MB data, including metabolite identification, after IV administration.

In vitro studies indicate that CYP3A4 and UGT1A1 are the main enzymes involved in the metabolism. About 33% of the parent drug appeared unchanged in the feces; this may represent buprenorphine itself undergoing P-glycoprotein (P-gp)–mediated efflux out of the liver or deconjugation of the glucuronidated form of the parent. Both scenarios were assessed using the PBPK model, and the relative contributions of the different clearance mechanisms were confirmed using the clinical DDI data (PLCA framework). Application of age-related physiology and ontogeny of relevant enzymes demonstrated that the model was able to capture exposures of buprenorphine after sublingual dosing in term neonates with neonatal abstinence syndrome.

### Buprenorphine [^111a2BaP]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

When buprenorphine sublingual tablets are administered sublingually, buprenorphine has a mean elimination half-life from plasma ranging from 31 to 35 hours.

- **Drug interactions studies**: CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers

	- Buprenorphine has been found to be a CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 inhibitor, and its major metabolite, norbuprenorphine, has been found to be a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor with in vitro studies employing human liver microsomes. However, the relatively low plasma concentrations of buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine resulting from therapeutic doses are not expected to raise significant drug-drug interaction concerns [see Drug Interactions (7)].

- **Specific populations**: Hepatic impairment

	- In a pharmacokinetic study, the disposition of buprenorphine was determined after administering a 2.0 mg/0.5 mg buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablet in subjects with varied degrees of hepatic impairment as indicated by Child-Pugh criteria. The disposition of buprenorphine in patients with hepatic impairment was compared to the disposition in subjects with normal hepatic function. In subjects with mild hepatic impairment, the changes in mean Cmax, AUC0-last, and half-life values of buprenorphine were not clinically significant. For subjects with moderate and severe hepatic impairment, mean Cmax, AUC0-last, and half-life values of buprenorphine were increased [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12), Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

- **HCV infection**:

	- In subjects with HCV infection but no sign of hepatic impairment, the changes in the mean Cmax, AUC0-last, and half-life values of buprenorphine were not clinically significant.

### A phase 1b study to investigate the potential interactions between ASP8062 and buprenorphine/naloxone in patients with opioid use disorder [^111tNytT]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). High credibility.

There is an unmet need for therapeutics with greater efficacy and tolerability for the treatment of opioid use disorder (OUD). ASP8062 is a novel compound with positive allosteric modulator activity on the γ-aminobutyric acid type B receptor under development for use with standard-of-care treatment for patients with OUD.

- **Aims**: To investigate the safety, tolerability, interaction potential, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of ASP8062 in combination with buprenorphine/naloxone (B/N; Suboxone®).
- **Methods**: In this phase 1, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled study, patients with OUD began B/N (titrated to 16/4 mg/day) treatment upon enrollment (induction, Days 1–4; maintenance, Days 5–18; downward titration, Days 19–26; and discharge, Day 27). On Day 12, patients received a single dose of ASP8062 60 mg or placebo with B/N and underwent safety and PK assessments. Primary endpoints included frequency and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), clinical laboratory tests, respiratory depression, and suicidal ideation. Secondary endpoints investigated the impact of ASP8062 on B/N PK.
- **Results**: Eighteen patients were randomized and completed the study (ASP8062, n = 12; placebo, n = 6). With this sample size typical for phase 1 drug-drug interaction studies, ASP8062 was well-tolerated; most TEAEs were mild in severity, and none led to treatment withdrawal. ASP8062 did not enhance substance use-related TEAEs, respiratory depression, or suicidal ideation and did not have a clinically significant impact on the PK of B/N.

### Interactions of the protease inhibitor, ritonavir, with common anesthesia drugs [^114HTSfZ]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2022). Low credibility.

Oxycodone metabolism occurs through CYP3A-mediated N-demethylation to noroxycodone and CYP2D6 O-demethylation to oxymorphone and noroxymorphone. Clearance is in the intermediate range (48 L h−1/70 kg), and because it is metabolized by both CYP3A and CYP2D6, clearance reduction by ritonavir will occur. However, this opioid, like the benzodiazepine midazolam, has increased relative bioavailability when given orally with ritonavir, and a smaller oxycodone dose will be needed to avoid opioid-related adverse effects.

Ritonavir reduced the clearance of fentanyl in adults by 67% when given in doses similar to those used for HIV infection. Fentanyl is commonly administered as an infusion or intermittent bolus dose, situations where redistribution rather than clearance may have a greater effect on plasma concentration. While it is possible that ritonavir concentrations achieved in children using the lower dose that augments nirmatrelvir activity are less than the IC50 of 1.62 mg L−1, associated with CYP3A4 inhibition, fentanyl clearance will still be compromised, implying that fentanyl plasma concentration will be slow to decrease after an intravenous bolus and that accumulation may occur during infusion.

Protease inhibitors can also inhibit specific uridine 5′-diphosphoglucuronosyltransferase (UGT) pathways. This accounts for the increase in bilirubin concentration (i.e. UGT 1A1 responsible for bilirubin conjugation) observed in some patients, although UGT 1A6 (i.e. acetaminophen glucuronidation) and UGT 2B7 (i.e. morphine glucuronidation) are unaffected. Dexmedetomidine is met…

### Different profiles of buprenorphine-induced analgesia and antihyperalgesia in a human pain model [^115G2rUC]. Pain (2005). Low credibility.

Different mechanisms were proposed for opioid-induced analgesia and antihyperalgesia, which might result in different pharmacodynamics. To address this issue, the time course of analgesic and antihyperalgesic effects of intravenous (i.v.) and sublingual (s.l.) buprenorphine was assessed in an experimental human pain model. Fifteen volunteers were enrolled in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study. The magnitude of pain and the area of secondary hyperalgesia following transcutaneous stimulation were repetitively assessed before and up to 150 minutes after administration of (1) 0.15 mg buprenorphine i.v. and placebo pill s.l., (2) 0.2 mg buprenorphine s.l. and saline 0.9% i.v., or (3) saline 0.9% i.v. and placebo pill s.l. as a control. The sessions were separated by two-week wash-out periods. For both applications of buprenorphine, the antihyperalgesic effects were more pronounced compared to the analgesic effects (66% ± 9 vs. 26% ± 5 and 43% ± 10 vs. 10% ± 6, for i.v. and s.l. application, respectively). This contrasts the pattern for the intravenous administration of pure mu-receptor agonists in the same model, in which the antihyperalgesic effects are weaker. The apparent bioavailability of buprenorphine s.l. compared to buprenorphine i.v. was 58%, with a 15.8-minute later onset of antinociceptive effects. The half-life of buprenorphine-induced analgesic and antihyperalgesic effects was 171 and 288 minutes, respectively. In contrast to pure mu-receptor agonists, buprenorphine exerts a lasting antihyperalgesic effect in our model.

### Buprenorphine in cancer pain [^113uwMGM]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

Buprenorphine is a broad-spectrum, highly lipophilic, and long-acting partial mu opioid receptor agonist that is non-cross tolerant to other opioids. It can be administered by several routes. Metabolism occurs through CYP3A4 and CYP2C8, as well as by conjugases. Constipation and sexual dysfunction appear to be less with buprenorphine than with other opioids.

The recent development of a polymer matrix patch delivery system for buprenorphine prevents "dose dumping" and facilitates pain management in those unable to take oral analgesics. Sublingual buprenorphine has been combined with naloxone to prevent illicit conversion to parenteral administration. It has been used extensively to control cancer pain. In certain clinical situations, buprenorphine may have particular advantages over other opioids.

### Mechanism-based pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling of the antinociceptive effect of buprenorphine in healthy volunteers [^115GJZdU]. Anesthesiology (2006). Low credibility.

The objective of this investigation was to characterize the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relation of buprenorphine's antinociceptive effect in healthy volunteers.

- **Methods**: Data on the time course of the antinociceptive effect after intravenous administration of 0.05–0.6 mg/70 kg buprenorphine in healthy volunteers was analyzed in conjunction with plasma concentrations using nonlinear mixed-effects analysis.

- **Results**: A three-compartment pharmacokinetic model best described the concentration time course. Four structurally different pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic models were evaluated for their appropriateness to describe the time course of buprenorphine's antinociceptive effect:
	1. E(max) model with an effect compartment model.
	2. "Power" model with an effect compartment model.
	3. Receptor association-dissociation model with a linear transduction function.
	4. Combined biophase equilibration/receptor association-dissociation model with a linear transduction function.

	- The latter model described the time course of effect best and was used to explain time dependencies in buprenorphine's pharmacodynamics. The model converged, yielding precise estimation of the parameters characterizing hysteresis and the relation between relative receptor occupancy and antinociceptive effect. The rate constant describing biophase equilibration (k(eo)) was 0.00447 min⁻¹ (95% confidence interval, 0.00299–0.00595 min⁻¹). The receptor dissociation rate constant (k(off)) was 0.0785 min⁻¹ (95% confidence interval, 0.0352–0.122 min⁻¹).

### Pharmacokinetics of buprenorphine: A comparison of sublingual tablet versus liquid after chronic dosing [^114VX7fu]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Although buprenorphine is approved for use in the outpatient treatment of opioid addiction in two tablet formulations, a monoproduct containing buprenorphine only (Subutex) and a buprenorphine/naloxone combination product (Suboxone), much of the clinical data that support the approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration were generated by using a sublingual liquid. To interpret the literature in prescribing parameters for tablet buprenorphine, this study was designed to determine steady-state buprenorphine plasma levels for the two formulations and to assess the relative bioavailability of each.

A randomized, double-blind, crossover study with dose increases was conducted over a 12-week period at an outpatient treatment clinic. Of the 184 subjects initially randomized to treatment, 133 (72.3%) were evaluated for the steady-state trough plasma concentration, 16 (8.7%) for relative bioavailability, and 31 (16.8%) for dose proportionality. At steady state, differences in the trough plasma concentrations of buprenorphine between the two formulations were found across all the dose levels.

The average plasma concentration (Cavg) of the tablet at twice the milligram dose of the liquid was twice that of the liquid; intersubject variability was greater for the tablet. At double the dose of the tablet, there is no difference in steady-state plasma concentrations. The bioavailability appears equivalent for the two formulations across all the dose levels.

- **Methods: Study population**: This was a phase I open-label, multiple-dose, single-center study. Eligible subjects were healthy male and nonpregnant, nonlactating female subjects aged 18 to 45 years, with a BMI between 19 and 30 kg/m². The study protocol and informed consent were approved by the study center's Institutional Review Board, and subjects provided written consent before study participation.

Major inclusion criteria included healthy subjects based on medical history, physical examinations, laboratory evaluations, normal 12-lead electrocardiogram, estimated creatinine clearance (Cockroft-Gault) > 80 mL/min, no evidence of HIV, hepatitis B virus, or hepatitis C virus infection, and use of at least two forms of contraception, including an effective barrier method. Exclusion criteria included plasma and blood donation within 7 and 56 days of study enrollment, respectively; active medical illness; and use of prescription drugs within 28 days of study drug dosing, except for vitamins, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and/or hormonal contraceptives.

### Buprenorphine TTS for children — a review of the drug's clinical pharmacology [^113nGVYM]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2011). Low credibility.

The transdermal therapeutic system (TTS) with buprenorphine is currently being used 'off-label' to treat chronic pediatric pain. We compiled available pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD), and clinical pediatric data on buprenorphine to rationalize treatment regimens.

- **Methods**: We conducted a systematic biomedical literature review focusing on pediatric buprenorphine data.

- **Results**: There are few relevant pediatric buprenorphine data, particularly in children suffering from chronic pain. There are no pediatric PK and PD data for children with chronic pain given sublingual or TTS formulations. Children given a single dose of buprenorphine have increased drug clearance referenced to body weight, with a possible paradoxical longer duration of action. Buprenorphine metabolism is independent of renal function, which is advantageous in renal insufficiency. The risk of respiratory depression after buprenorphine is difficult to quantify. A concentration-response relationship for respiratory effects has not been described, and it is unknown whether children have a ceiling effect similar to that described in healthy adult volunteers.

- **Conclusions**: Buprenorphine is of interest in pediatric postoperative pain and cancer pain control because of its multiple administration routes, long duration of action, and metabolism largely independent of renal function. There is little reason to expect buprenorphine effects in children out of infancy are fundamentally different from those in adults. From the limited pediatric data available, it appears that buprenorphine has no higher adverse potential in children.

### Buprenorphine [^114X2XXN]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Clinical data on the safety and efficacy of buprenorphine were derived from studies of buprenorphine sublingual tablet formulations, with and without naloxone, and from studies of sublingual administration of a more bioavailable ethanolic solution of buprenorphine. Buprenorphine sublingual tablets were studied in 1,834 patients; buprenorphine and naloxone tablets in 575 patients; and buprenorphine sublingual solutions in 2,470 patients. A total of 1,270 women received buprenorphine in these clinical trials.

Dosing recommendations are based on data from one trial of both tablet formulations and two trials of the ethanolic solution. All trials used buprenorphine in conjunction with psychosocial counseling as part of a comprehensive addiction treatment program. There were no clinical studies conducted to assess the efficacy of buprenorphine as the only component of treatment.

In a double-blind placebo- and active-controlled study, 326 heroin-addicted subjects were randomly assigned to either buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets, 16/4 mg per day; buprenorphine sublingual tablets, 16 mg per day; or placebo sublingual tablets. For subjects randomized to either active treatment, dosing began with one 8 mg buprenorphine on Day 1, followed by 16 mg (two 8 mg tablets) of buprenorphine on Day 2. On Day 3, those randomized to receive buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets were switched to the combination tablet. Subjects randomized to placebo received one placebo tablet on Day 1 and two placebo tablets per day thereafter for four weeks.

### Biased cytochrome P450-mediated metabolism via small-molecule ligands binding P450 oxidoreductase [^1149agRd]. Nature Communications (2021). Low credibility.

Metabolic control is mediated by the dynamic assemblies and function of multiple redox enzymes. A key element in these assemblies, the P450 oxidoreductase (POR), donates electrons and selectively activates numerous (> 50 in humans and > 300 in plants) cytochromes P450 (CYPs) controlling metabolism of drugs, steroids, and xenobiotics in humans and natural product biosynthesis in plants. The mechanisms underlying POR-mediated CYP metabolism remain poorly understood, and at the time of writing, no ligand binding has been described to regulate the specificity of POR. Here, using a combination of computational modeling and functional assays, we identify ligands that dock on POR and bias its specificity towards CYP redox partners across the mammal and plant kingdoms.

Single-molecule FRET studies reveal ligand binding to alter POR conformational sampling, which results in biased activation of metabolic cascades in whole-cell assays. We propose the model of biased metabolism, a mechanism akin to biased signaling of GPCRs, where ligand binding on POR stabilizes different conformational states that are linked to distinct metabolic outcomes. Biased metabolism may allow the design of pathway-specific therapeutics or personalized food suppressing undesired, disease-related metabolic pathways.

### Buprenorphine: The basic pharmacology revisited [^115CbPUx]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

The historical background leading to the use of buprenorphine as an analgesic and its role in the management of opioid dependence is summarized. The popular description of buprenorphine as a "partial agonist" is discussed in relation to efficacy in animal models of antinociception and clinical analgesia. The latest information on the respiratory depressant effects of buprenorphine and its N-dealkylated metabolite (norbuprenorphine) is presented. New data on the buprenorphine withdrawal syndrome in rats are described.

### Efficacy of buprenorphine/naloxone rapidly dissolving sublingual tablets (BNX-RDT) after switching from BNX sublingual film [^115Esntd]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

The efficacy data provide clinical evidence that doses determined to be bioequivalent in a previous pharmacokinetic study are also clinically comparable when transitioning between products (i.e. a 5.7/1.4-mg buprenorphine/naloxone dose of BNX-RDT is clinically similar to an 8/2-mg buprenorphine/naloxone dose of BNX sublingual film). Thus, it is noteworthy that comparable efficacy can be expected when patients are treated with an approximately 30% lower dose of BNX-RDT than of BNX film. In clinical practice, patients might express concerns about switching to a lower dose. To the extent that expectations can influence perceived drug effects, the findings from the study may help alleviate patient concerns about a transition to a lower bioequivalent dose of the tablet formulation and thus avoid a potentially unnecessary dose increase. Although the study indicates efficacy and tolerability when changing between products, practitioners should continually monitor patients for signs of overmedication, withdrawal, or underdosing, as dose adjustments may be necessary when switching treatments.

A substantial majority (> 70%) of patients who had experience with both BNX formulations reported that they preferred BNX-RDT over BNX film in terms of taste, mouthfeel, ease of administration, and overall acceptability. Previously reported preference data on sublingual buprenorphine-containing products have been mixed. Although patients reported preferring the first approved BNX tablet formulation (Suboxone) over buprenorphine alone in terms of taste, size, and sublingual dissolution.

### Olinvyk [^114Vrx9H]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Drug interaction studies

In vitro studies suggest that oliceridine is metabolized primarily by the CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 P450 hepatic enzymes, with minor contributions from CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. Inhibition studies using selective inhibitors of all the major CYP enzymes show that only the inhibition of CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 significantly affects the metabolism of oliceridine in these assays, suggesting that the contribution of CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 to the metabolism of oliceridine is minor.

The effect of concomitant administration of a CYP2D6 inhibitor on the pharmacokinetics of Olinvyk, although not studied, may be similar to that noted in subjects who are CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. The plasma clearance of oliceridine in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers is approximately 50% of plasma clearance in subjects who are nonpoor CYP2D6 metabolizers [see Pharmacogenomics (12.5)].

In healthy subjects who are CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (n = 4) given a single 0.25 mg dose of Olinvyk after 5 days of itraconazole 200 mg QD (a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor), the total exposure (AUC) of Olinvyk increased by approximately 80%; however, the peak concentration was not significantly affected. The mean clearance of oliceridine was reduced to approximately 30% of that observed in nonpoor metabolizers of CYP2D6 [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Oliceridine does not inhibit any P450 enzymes at clinically relevant concentrations.

Pharmacogenomics

Oliceridine is metabolized by the polymorphic enzyme CYP2D6. CYP2D6 poor metabolizers have little to no enzyme activity. Approximately 3 to 10% of Whites exhibit this phenotype.

### Buprenorphine [^116EbHWj]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Concomitant use of buprenorphine and benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants increases the risk of adverse reactions, including overdose and death. Medication-assisted treatment of opioid use disorder, however, should not be categorically denied to patients taking these drugs. Prohibiting or creating barriers to treatment can pose an even greater risk of morbidity and mortality due to the opioid use disorder alone.

As a routine part of orientation to buprenorphine treatment, educate patients about the risks of concomitant use of benzodiazepines, sedatives, opioid analgesics, and alcohol. Develop strategies to manage the use of prescribed or illicit benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants at the initiation of buprenorphine treatment, or if it emerges as a concern during treatment. Adjustments to induction procedures and additional monitoring may be required. There is no evidence to support dose limitations or arbitrary caps of buprenorphine as a strategy to address benzodiazepine use in buprenorphine-treated patients. However, if a patient is sedated at the time of buprenorphine dosing, delay or omit the buprenorphine dose if appropriate.

Cessation of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants is preferred in most cases of concomitant use. In some cases, monitoring in a higher level of care for taper may be appropriate. In others, gradually tapering a patient off a prescribed benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant or decreasing to the lowest effective dose may be appropriate.

### Mechanisms for experimental buprenorphine hepatotoxicity: Major role of mitochondrial dysfunction versus metabolic activation [^11629q2m]. Journal of Hepatology (2001). Low credibility.

Although sublingual buprenorphine is safely used as a substitution drug in heroin addicts, large overdoses or intravenous misuse may cause hepatitis. Buprenorphine is N-dealkylated to norbuprenorphine by CYP3A.

- **Methods**: We investigated the mitochondrial effects and metabolic activation of buprenorphine in isolated rat liver mitochondria and microsomes, and its toxicity in isolated rat hepatocytes and treated mice.

- **Results**: Whereas norbuprenorphine had few mitochondrial effects, buprenorphine (25–200 microM) concentrated in mitochondria, collapsed the membrane potential, inhibited beta-oxidation, and both uncoupled and inhibited respiration in rat liver mitochondria. Both buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine (200 microM) underwent CYP3A-mediated covalent binding to rat liver microsomal proteins and both caused moderate glutathione depletion and increased cell calcium in isolated rat hepatocytes, but only buprenorphine also depleted cell adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and caused necrotic cell death. Four hours after buprenorphine administration to mice (100 nmol/g body weight), hepatic glutathione was unchanged, while ATP was decreased and serum transaminase increased. This transaminase increase was attenuated by a CYP3A inducer and aggravated by a CYP3A inhibitor.

- **Conclusions**: Both buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine undergo metabolic activation, but only buprenorphine impairs mitochondrial respiration and ATP formation. The hepatotoxicity of high concentrations or doses of buprenorphine is mainly related to its mitochondrial effects.

### Strategy for effective analgesia with intravenous buprenorphine in patients with acute postoperative pain [^113XKUr1]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). High credibility.

Buprenorphine is a mild analgesic opioid that falls under the category of partial mu (µ) receptor agonists. The drug is available in several forms, including a transdermal system, lozenge tablets, and an injectable solution. In 1982, the FDA approved the injectable solution for treating acute pain of moderate to severe intensity. This solution is designed for intramuscular delivery or slow intravenous injection. Buprenorphine is provided as a clear liquid, containing 0.3 mg of the drug per milliliter. It reaches its maximum plasma concentration within 5 to 15 minutes, with a duration of action estimated to last 6 hours or more. A literature review by Hale et al. confirms that intravenous buprenorphine is effective for pain relief, showing comparable or superior efficacy to morphine in managing postoperative pain.

- **Analgesic efficacy**: Posso-Sierra et al. reported on the evaluation of the analgesic efficacy of buprenorphine in treating acute postoperative pain in patients who have undergone thoracic surgery. They highlight the importance of buprenorphine in pain management. The study indicates that a multimodal approach to pain treatment following thoracoscopic surgery helps to reduce pain intensity. Buprenorphine, administered at doses of 1 to 3 µg/kg body weight, does not cause nausea, vomiting, rash, or respiratory depression. The researchers found that using buprenorphine at doses of 2 and 3 µg/kg body weight allows for better pain control, resulting in more effective analgesia.

Buresh et al. noted that treating acute postoperative pain in patients who have been using buprenorphine chronically could be challenging and requires careful management.

Regarding medical management for opioid use disorder, specifically concerning buprenorphine/naloxone, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend starting buprenorphine with a dose of 2–4 mg once objective signs of withdrawal are observed. Consider increasing the dosage in increments of 2–8 mg.

### Perioperative opioid requirements of patients receiving sublingual buprenorphine-naloxone: a case series [^115gUJnZ]. BMC Anesthesiology (2019). Low credibility.

Buprenorphine is a partial μ-opioid receptor agonist with high receptor affinity and slow dissociation. Because of the long half-life of buprenorphine, the peak-and-valley plasma effects seen with shorter-acting opioids are minimized. Furthermore, buprenorphine exerts κ-opioid receptor antagonism, which minimizes the psychotomimetic and euphoric effects associated with opioid use. These unique features are useful for the treatment of chronic pain and maintenance therapy for individuals with opioid use disorders.

Buprenorphine is sometimes co-administered with naloxone, most commonly in the sublingual formulation (film or tablet) containing buprenorphine and naloxone in a 4:1 ratio (Suboxone [SL-BUP]; Indivior Inc). A combination of buprenorphine and naloxone reduces the potential for inappropriate use of buprenorphine because naloxone has poor bioavailability when taken sublingually; therefore, only clinically insignificant amounts of naloxone are absorbed into the blood. However, when buprenorphine-naloxone is abused, whether by intravenous or intranasal administration, naloxone is an effective antagonist of buprenorphine.

Buprenorphine may have implications in perioperative pain management. Because buprenorphine has high receptor affinity, it displaces full opioid agonists from receptors. In addition, buprenorphine reportedly has an analgesic ceiling effect and, therefore, less efficiently provides pain relief to patients after surgery with expected high pain acuity. The effect of SL-BUP on perioperative pain management has rarely been reported. In the present study, we…

### Opioid metabolism and drug-drug interaction in cancer [^115ZDieq]. The Oncologist (2024). Low credibility.

Opioids included buprenorphine, fentanyl, hydrocodone, methadone, morphine, oxycodone, and tramadol. Anticancer drugs included chemotherapeutics such as taxanes (specifically paclitaxel and docetaxel), platinum agents (specifically oxaliplatin, carboplatin, and cisplatin), oxazaphosphorines (specifically cyclophosphamide), and vinca alkaloids (specifically vincristine); TKIs (dasatinib, gefitinib, imatinib, and nilotinib); biologics (atezolizumab, nivolumab, and trastuzumab); cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitors (palbociclib and ribociclib); estrogen receptor modulators (tamoxifen); steroid hormones (abiraterone); and nonsteroidal antiandrogens (enzalutamide).

- **Drug-drug interaction terms**: These included drug interaction(s), drug-drug interaction(s), drug antagonism, polypharmacy, drug synergism(s), drug potentiation(s), drug augmentation(s), drug toxicity, drug competition, drug inhibition, and drug intoxication.

- **Methodology**: The findings on the drug-drug interaction (DDI) checker were manually compared to observations from the literature search to identify clinical evidence for potential DDIs.

- **Expert opinion**: The authors' expert views on the use of internet checker tools and databases in the assessment of DDIs and guiding treatment decisions in clinical practice were compiled and summarized.

### Allelic expression imbalance of the human CYP3A4 gene and individual phenotypic status [^1169SxBr]. Human Molecular Genetics (2004). Low credibility.

The human cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) plays a dominant role in the metabolism of numerous clinically useful drugs. Alterations in the activity or expression of this enzyme may account for a major part of the variation in drug responsiveness and toxicity. However, it is generally accepted that most of the known single nucleotide polymorphisms in the coding and 5'-flanking regions are not the main determinants for the large inter-individual variability of CYP3A4 expression and activity.

We show that the allelic variation is critically involved in determining the individual total hepatic CYP3A4 mRNA level and metabolic capability. There exists a definite correlation between the total CYP3A4 mRNA level and allelic expression ratio, the relative transcript level ratio derived from the two alleles.

Individuals with a low expression ratio, exhibiting a large difference of transcript level between the two alleles, revealed extremely low levels of total hepatic CYP3A4 mRNA, and thus low metabolic capability as assessed by testosterone 6beta-hydroxylation. These results present a new insight into individualized CYP3A4-dependent pharmacotherapy and the importance of expression imbalance to human phenotypic diversity.

### Common polymorphisms of CYP2B6 influence stereoselective bupropion disposition [^116Ge6QC]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). Low credibility.

Bupropion hydroxylation is a bioactivation and metabolic pathway and serves as the standard clinical CYP2B6 probe. This investigation determined the influence of CYP2B6 allelic variants on clinical concentrations and metabolism of bupropion enantiomers. Secondary objectives evaluated the influence of CYP2C19 and P450 oxidoreductase variants. Healthy volunteers in specific cohorts (CYP2B6✱1/✱1, CYP2B6✱1/✱6, CYP2B6✱6/✱6, and also CYP2B6✱4 carriers) received single-dose oral bupropion. Plasma and urine concentrations of bupropion and hydroxybupropion were quantified. Subjects were also genotyped for CYP2C19 and P450 oxidoreductase variants.

- **Hydroxylation of bupropion enantiomers**: Assessed by plasma hydroxybupropion/bupropion AUC ratios and urine hydroxybupropion formation clearances. Hydroxylation was lower in CYP2B6✱6/✱6 but not in CYP2B6✱1/✱6 compared with CYP2B6✱1/✱1 genotypes and numerically greater in CYP2B6✱4 carriers. CYP2C19 and P450 oxidoreductase variants did not influence bupropion enantiomers' hydroxylation or plasma concentrations. The results show that clinical hydroxylation of both bupropion enantiomers was equivalently influenced by CYP2B6 allelic variation. CYP2B6 polymorphisms affect S-bupropion bioactivation, which may affect therapeutic outcomes.

### Opioid metabolism and drug-drug interaction in cancer [^115Dozfa]. The Oncologist (2024). Low credibility.

Most of the identified opioid DDIs from the DDI-checker are related to their CYP metabolism, mainly involving CYP3A4 and CYP2D6, while a few are related to glucuronidation by uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT).

- **Buprenorphine**: Buprenorphine is metabolized through N-dealkylation via CYP3A4 to form the active metabolite norbuprenorphine. Both buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine are further modified through glucuronidation by UGT2B7 and UGT1A1, respectively. Buprenorphine is a partial agonist at the μ opioid receptor and an antagonist at the κ opioid receptor. Like other μ agonists, it may cause respiratory depression, miosis, and mood changes, in addition to analgesia. However, regarding the respiratory outcome, there appears to be a ceiling effect with high doses. Norbuprenorphine is a potent agonist of μ, δ, and κ opioid receptors and, in animal models, may cause greater respiratory depression while having reduced antinociception compared with buprenorphine.

According to the DDI-checker, buprenorphine DDIs that have not been studied but may be clinically significant involve coadministration with enzalutamide, imatinib, and ribociclib. Enzalutamide is a strong CYP3A4 inducer and can also induce UGT1A1. This may increase the formation of active buprenorphine metabolites leading to toxicity. Imatinib and ribociclib (both CYP3A4 inhibitors) may increase concentrations of buprenorphine and decrease norbuprenorphine. Coadministration, if unavoidable, should be closely monitored for buprenorphine toxicity.

### Personalized medicine in psychiatry: Problems and promises [^116qKNz5]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The role of genetic alteration in drug-metabolizing enzymes is significant. Many of the SNPs reviewed above, along with numerous others, have been associated with predicting treatment response — both in terms of therapeutic efficacy and side-effect profile — to pharmacologic interventions. Beyond the effects specific to particular illnesses or drugs are the genetic changes in drug-metabolizing genes that underlie differential response to pharmacologic agents. These genetic changes will be reviewed first, followed by specific polymorphisms in non-drug-metabolizing enzymes (non-DME) and their relationship to specific psychiatric illnesses.

The most studied group of drug-metabolizing enzymes (DME) in psychiatry is the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme family. CYP enzymes are expressed predominantly in the liver, although they are also found in many extra-hepatic locations, including the brain, where their levels are approximately 0.5 to 2% of those in the liver. Moreover, the genes coding for the CYP enzyme family are highly polymorphic, and the effects of many of the genetic differences contribute to the differential metabolism of psychotropic agents. DME phenotypes are broadly grouped into four categories based on genotype effect on enzyme activity:

1. **Poor metabolizers (PM)**
2. **Intermediate metabolizers (IM)**
3. **Extensive metabolizers (EM)**
4. **Ultra-rapid metabolizers (UM)**

CYP2D6 is an important member of the CYP enzyme family because it is responsible for metabolizing nearly 50% of the most commonly prescribed psychotropics, and evidence in animal models indicates its involvement in biosynthesis.

### Butrans [^115dJMzT]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Following transdermal application, buprenorphine is eliminated via hepatic metabolism, with subsequent biliary excretion and renal excretion of soluble metabolites. After removal of Butrans, mean buprenorphine concentrations decrease approximately 50% within 10–24 hours, followed by a decline with an apparent terminal half-life of approximately 26 hours. Since metabolism and excretion of buprenorphine occur mainly via hepatic elimination, reductions in hepatic blood flow induced by some general anesthetics (e.g. halothane) and other drugs may result in a decreased rate of hepatic elimination of the drug, leading to increased plasma concentrations.

The total clearance of buprenorphine is approximately 55 L/hour in postoperative patients.

- **Drug interaction studies**:

	- **Effect of CYP3A4 inhibitors**: In a drug-drug interaction study, Butrans 10 mcg/hour (single dose x 7 days) was co-administered with 200 mg ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, or ketoconazole placebo twice daily for 11 days, and the pharmacokinetics of buprenorphine and its metabolites were evaluated. Plasma buprenorphine concentrations did not accumulate during co-medication with ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily. Based on the results from this study, metabolism during therapy with Butrans is not expected to be affected by co-administration of CYP3A4 inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Antiretroviral agents have been evaluated for CYP3A4-mediated interactions with sublingual buprenorphine. Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) do not a

### Bench to bedside: Pharmacogenomics, adverse drug interactions, and the cytochrome P450 system [^116eB4UF]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

As physicians attempt to improve the quality of health care, one area of particular concern has been preventable medical errors from adverse drug interactions. The cytochrome P450 family of enzymes has been implicated in a large number of these preventable adverse drug interactions. This report reviews the basic biochemistry and pharmacogenomics underlying the reactions catalyzed by the cytochrome P450 family of enzymes. An emphasis is placed on the phenotypic variations within a population and the resulting clinical effects. In addition, six members of the cytochrome P450 superfamily that are responsible for the metabolism of the majority of pharmaceutical agents are profiled in detail. These enzymes, CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2E1, and CYP1A2, are reviewed with regard to their phenotypic variation in the population and the resulting clinical and therapeutic implications.

### Methadone enantiomer plasma levels, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, and CYP2C9 genotypes, and response to treatment [^115VWZJj]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2005). Low credibility.

Recent in vitro studies have suggested an important role of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2B6 and CYP2C19 in methadone metabolism. We aimed to determine the influence of CYP2B6, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 genetic polymorphism on methadone pharmacokinetics and on the response to treatment.

- **Methods**: We included 209 patients in methadone maintenance treatment on the basis of their response to treatment and their daily methadone dose. Patients were genotyped for CYP2B6, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. Steady-state trough and peak (R)-, (S)-, and (R, S)-plasma levels and peak-to-trough plasma level ratios were measured.

- **Results**: CYP2B6 genotype influences (S)-methadone and, to a lesser extent, (R)-methadone plasma levels, with the median trough (S)-methadone plasma levels being 105, 122, and 209 ng. kg/mL. mg for the noncarriers of allele *6, heterozygous carriers, and homozygous carriers (*6/✱6), respectively (P = 0.0004). CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 genotypes do not influence methadone plasma levels. Lower peak and trough plasma levels of methadone and higher peak-to-trough ratios were measured in patients considered as nonresponders [median (R, S)-methadone trough plasma levels of 183 and 249 ng. kg/mL. mg (P = 0.0004) and median peak-to-trough ratios of 1.82 and 1.58 for high-dose nonresponders and high-dose responders, respectively (P = 0.0003)].

- **Conclusion**: Although CYP2B6 influences (S)-methadone plasma levels, given that only (R)-methadone contributes to the opioid effect of this drug, a major influence of CYP2B6 genotype on response to treatment is unlikely.

### Buprenorphine and naloxone [^112ocHcw]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Pharmacokinetics**:

- **Absorption**: In several pharmacokinetic studies following the administration of different dosages, a dose of one or two of the 2 mg/0.5 mg buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual films administered sublingually or buccally showed comparable relative bioavailability to the same total dose of buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets. In contrast, one 8 mg/2 mg and one 12 mg/3 mg buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual films administered sublingually or buccally exhibited higher relative bioavailability for both buprenorphine and naloxone compared to the same total dose of buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets. A combination of one 8 mg/2 mg and two 2 mg/0.5 mg buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual films (total dose of 12 mg/3 mg) administered sublingually demonstrated comparable relative bioavailability to the same total dose of buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets, while buccally administered buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual films showed higher relative bioavailability. This information is supported by Table 5, which illustrates the relative increase in exposure to buprenorphine and naloxone associated with buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual films compared to buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets and shows the effect of the route of administration [see Dosage and Administration (2.9, 2.10)].

Across relevant pharmacokinetic studies, the pharmacokinetic parameters and exposures derived from the buccal and sublingual administrations of buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film were comparable to one another.

### Prevalence estimates of cytochrome P450 phenoconversion in youth receiving pharmacotherapy for mental health conditions [^112XZiVD]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Low credibility.

Pharmacogenetics-predicted drug metabolism may not match clinically observed metabolism due to a phenomenon known as phenoconversion. Phenoconversion can occur when an inhibitor or inducer of a drug-metabolizing enzyme is present. Although estimates of phenoconversion in adult populations are available, prevalence estimates in youth populations are limited. To address this gap, we estimated the prevalence of phenoconversion in 1,281 youth (ages 6–24) receiving pharmacotherapy for mental health conditions who had pharmacogenetics testing completed for four genes: CYP2B6, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. Self-reported medication and cannabidiol/cannabis use were collected at the time of pharmacogenetics testing. Nearly half (46%) of the cohort was estimated to be phenoconverted for one of the four genes examined.

Comparison of metabolizer phenotype frequencies before and after adjustment for phenoconversion showed significantly more youth had actionable phenotypes for CYP2C19 (60.3% vs. 69.1%; P ≤ 0.001), CYP2D6 (49.3% vs. 63.0%; P ≤ 0.001), and CYP3A4 (8.5% vs. 12.2%; P = 0.003) after phenoconversion adjustment. Of youth who were phenoconverted, 24% had a change in their metabolizer phenotype that would lead to pharmacogenetics-based prescribing guidelines recommending a change to standard prescribing (dose adjustment or alternative medication). Our findings indicate a high prevalence of cytochrome P450 phenoconversion among youth receiving pharmacotherapy for mental health conditions. Adjustment for phenoconversion should be considered when implementing pharmacogenetic recommendations.

### The pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profile of intranasal crushed buprenorphine and buprenorphine/naloxone tablets in opioid abusers [^115VY3hF]. Addiction (2011). Low credibility.

Sublingual buprenorphine and buprenorphine/naloxone are efficacious opioid dependence pharmacotherapies, but there are reports of their diversion and misuse by the intranasal route. The study aimed to characterize and compare their intranasal pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profiles.

- **Design**: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study was conducted.

- **Setting**: The study took place in an in-patient research unit at the University of Kentucky.

- **Participants**: The study involved healthy adults (n = 10) who were abusing, but not physically dependent on, intranasal opioids.

- **Measurements**: Six sessions, 72 hours apart, tested five intranasal doses [0/0, crushed buprenorphine (2, 8 mg), crushed buprenorphine/naloxone (2/0.5, 8/2 mg)] and one intravenous dose (0.8 mg buprenorphine/0.2 mg naloxone for bioavailability assessment). Plasma samples, physiological, and subject- and observer-rated measures were collected before and for up to 72 hours after drug administration.

- **Findings**: Both formulations produced time- and dose-dependent increases in subjective and physiological mu-opioid agonist effects (e.g. 'liking', miosis). Subjects reported higher subjective ratings and street values for 8 mg compared to 8/2 mg, though these differences were not statistically significant. No significant formulation differences in peak plasma buprenorphine concentration or time-course were observed. Buprenorphine bioavailability was 38–44%, and Tmax was 35–40 minutes after all intranasal doses. Naloxone bioavailability was 24% and 30% following 2/0.5 and 8/2 mg, respectively.

It is difficult to determine if observed results conclusively indicate differences in abuse potential between the formulations.

### The clinical implications of cytochrome P450 interactions with opioids and strategies for pain management [^115kZNjB]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2012). Low credibility.

Pharmacokinetic differences among opioids influence a patient's response to opioid treatment. An important element affecting a drug's pharmacokinetics, its metabolism, may be altered under various circumstances, thereby enhancing or mitigating a patient's response to opioids. The genetic background of the metabolic enzymes involved in opioid metabolism, comorbid medical conditions, older age, and the presence of other drugs that influence metabolism are such factors that can cause the response to opioid therapy to vary greatly from the expected response to a standard dose. As a result of the variability in individual responses to opioids, clinical management of pain with opioids must be empirical.

### Dose-adjusted plasma concentrations of sublingual buprenorphine are lower during than after pregnancy [^113abB5e]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

Buprenorphine is a Food and Drug Administration-approved maintenance therapy for opioid use disorders and is increasingly being used in pregnant women with opioid use disorders as an alternative to methadone. The dosing of buprenorphine in pregnant women is based on the regimen recommended for nonpregnant females and males. Limited data are available defining the pharmacokinetic properties of sublingual buprenorphine administered during pregnancy.

This study evaluated the impact of physiological changes associated with pregnancy on the pharmacokinetics of sublingual buprenorphine during and after pregnancy. Pregnant women (n = 13), between 18 0/7 and 37 6/7 weeks' singleton gestation, receiving sublingual buprenorphine twice daily for opioid use disorders were studied.

- **Study design**: Pharmacokinetic-2 studies were performed between 18 and 25 weeks (n = 7), pharmacokinetic-3 studies were performed between 31 and 37 weeks (n = 11), and pharmacokinetic-P was performed 4–18 weeks postpartum (n = 10). On the day of the study, blood was withdrawn prior to the daily morning dose of buprenorphine and at 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 8, and 12 hours after the dose. Buprenorphine plasma concentrations were analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometric detection. All pharmacokinetic parameters were observed or estimated using Microsoft Excel. Statistical analyses were performed to identify significant changes in study participants' buprenorphine pharmacokinetic parameter estimates over the duration of the study.

### Systematic benefit-risk assessment for buprenorphine implant: A semiquantitative method to support risk management [^111UStku]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

We searched a variety of sources to identify suitable data for inclusion: PubMed, EMA website, FDA website, and the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). In PubMed, we searched for papers on 'buprenorphine' and 'implant' (n = 40), in addition to 'probuphine' (n = 12). Additional filters were not applied due to the low number of results. The search strategy did not include 'Sixmo' as this brand name was not in use at the time of the search. Sublingual buprenorphine was the comparator of interest in all published studies. In addition, the RMP and Periodic Adverse Drug Experience Report for buprenorphine implant were obtained directly from the MAH.

Data were extracted from buprenorphine implant clinical trials (PRO-805, 806, and 814) and observational studies/data sets for each benefit and risk, for both buprenorphine implant and the comparator (sublingual buprenorphine).

In comparison to the sublingual formulation of buprenorphine, the key systemic adverse events and key systemic benefits reported with buprenorphine implant do not differ significantly because they are adverse events/benefits associated with the use of buprenorphine regardless of the method of administration. Consequently, the key benefits and risks of interest with buprenorphine implant are those related to the implant formulation, which includes the risk of implant site reactions. The value tree was subsequently refined to reflect this, alongside the removal of benefits and risks for which insufficient data were available.

### Buprenorphine and naloxone [^116TkQFz]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Buprenorphine undergoes both N-dealkylation to norbuprenorphine and glucuronidation. The N-dealkylation pathway is mediated primarily by CYP3A4. Norbuprenorphine, the major metabolite, can further undergo glucuronidation. Norbuprenorphine has been found to bind opioid receptors in vitro; however, it has not been studied clinically for opioid-like activity. Naloxone undergoes direct glucuronidation to naloxone-3-glucuronide, as well as N-dealkylation and reduction of the 6-oxo group.

A mass balance study of buprenorphine showed complete recovery of radiolabel in urine (30%) and feces (69%) collected up to 11 days after dosing. Almost all of the dose was accounted for in terms of buprenorphine, norbuprenorphine, and two unidentified buprenorphine metabolites. In urine, most of the buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine was conjugated (buprenorphine: 1% free and 9.4% conjugated; norbuprenorphine: 2.7% free and 11% conjugated). In feces, almost all of the buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine were free (buprenorphine: 33% free and 5% conjugated; norbuprenorphine: 21% free and 2% conjugated). Based on all studies performed with sublingually and buccally administered buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film, buprenorphine has a mean elimination half-life from plasma ranging from 24 to 42 hours, and naloxone has a mean elimination half-life from plasma ranging from 2 to 12 hours.

### Buprenorphine pharmacology review: Update on transmucosal and long-acting formulations [^112mtRdH]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Buprenorphine is an effective treatment for opioid use disorder. As a high-affinity, partial agonist for the mu-opioid receptor, buprenorphine suppresses opioid withdrawal and craving, reduces illicit opioid use, and blocks exogenous opioid effects, including respiratory depression. Other pharmacologic benefits of buprenorphine are its superior safety profile compared with full opioid agonists and its long half-life that allows for daily or less-than-daily dosing.

New and innovative buprenorphine formulations, with pharmacokinetic profiles that differ from the original tablet formulation, continue to be developed. These include higher bioavailability transmucosal tablets and films, as well as 6-month implantable and monthly injectable products. This growing array of available formulations allows more choices for patients and increased opportunity for clinicians to individualize treatment. Thus, it is important for buprenorphine prescribers to understand these differences.

### Sex and gender differences in clinical pharmacology: Implications for transgender medicine [^116P3oD8]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Low credibility.

CYP3A metabolizes more than 50% of prescribed medications. In the general adult population younger than 50 years of age, cisgender women have higher weight‐normalized clearance of oral and parenteral CYP3A substrates than cisgender men, although this difference is modest (up to 35%). Investigators hypothesized that sex‐related differences in CYP3A activity are associated with P‐glycoprotein activity, complicating our ability to determine the effect of sex hormones on CYP3A activity directly. During pregnancy, CYP3A activity is higher compared with postpartum activity. Sex hormones (estrogen replacement therapy or combined oral contraceptives) do not alter systemic or oral midazolam clearance. In addition to hormone therapy, transgender adults may take several medications metabolized by CYP3A, including antiretroviral therapy protease inhibitors.

- **Phase II metabolism and conjugation enzymes**: In the general adult population, weight‐adjusted oral clearance of several nonspecific uridine diphosphate (UDP)‐glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) substrates is higher in cisgender men than cisgender women: benzodiazepines (oxazepam, 40% higher, P < 0.05), and antipyretics (acetaminophen or paracetamol, 22% higher, P < 0.001). During pregnancy, apparent UGT1A4 activity increases compared with postpartum, demonstrated by decreased lamotrigine concentrations. Sex hormones (combined oral contraceptives) similarly increase clearance of UGT substrates. For example, Christensen et al. reported an 84% increase (95% confidence interval, 45–134%) in dose‐corrected lamotrigine concentrations in a small study.

### Transplacental transfer and metabolism of buprenorphine in preterm human placenta [^112Nf2bm]. American Journal of Perinatology (2011). Low credibility.

We sought to determine whether gestational age affects the transplacental transfer and metabolism of buprenorphine (BUP). Transfer of BUP (10 ng/mL) and its [(3)H]-isotope was determined across placentas of 30 to 34 weeks of gestation utilizing the technique of dual perfusion of placental lobule. The concentration of the drug in trophoblast tissue and in maternal and fetal circuits was determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry.

Microsomes prepared from placentas of 17 to 37 weeks of gestation were divided into three groups: late second, early third, and late third trimesters. Antibodies raised against human cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms were utilized to identify the enzyme(s) catalyzing BUP biotransformation by preterm placental microsomes. The amount of norbuprenorphine formed was determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS).

BUP transfer across the placentas of 30 to 34 weeks of gestation was similar to those at term. CYP19 antibodies caused 60% inhibition of BUP metabolism by microsomes of late second and early third trimesters and 85% by microsomes of late third trimester. The developmental changes occurring in human placenta between 30 weeks of gestation through term do not affect the transfer of BUP across human placenta. CYP19 is the major enzyme responsible for the biotransformation of BUP beginning at 17 weeks of gestation until term.

### Sublingual buprenorphine as an analgesic in chronic pain: a systematic review [^115ds9KQ]. Pain Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

There is a growing interest in the use of sublingual buprenorphine for the treatment of chronic pain due to its unique pharmacology, the widespread use of transdermal buprenorphine patches for chronic pain, and the recent availability of sublingual buprenorphine tablets for opioid dependence. This systematic review aimed to evaluate the evidence from clinical trials assessing the effectiveness of sublingual buprenorphine for chronic pain analgesia.

Electronic searches of MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were conducted to identify clinical trials of sublingual buprenorphine for chronic pain treatment. Ten trials, involving 1,190 patients, were included in the review. Due to the heterogeneity of studies, pooling of the results and meta-analysis was not possible. All studies reported that sublingual buprenorphine demonstrated some effectiveness as a chronic pain analgesic, although the majority were observational and of low quality.

Preliminary trials suggest a plausible role for sublingual buprenorphine in chronic pain treatment; however, due to a paucity of high-quality trials, the evidence is insufficient to determine its effectiveness conclusively. Rigorous further trials are warranted.

### Frequencies of clinically important CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 alleles are graded across Europe [^113HD9NJ]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2020). Low credibility.

Interindividual variability in therapeutic drug response can result in adverse drug reactions (ADRs) or lack of efficacy, constituting a key challenge for healthcare systems. Notably, 40–70% of patients experience insufficient drug response or drug toxicity, and ADRs account for 6.5% of all hospital admissions, of which up to 30% are life-threatening in at-risk subpopulations. Genetic polymorphisms in drug-metabolizing enzymes, transporters, or drug targets explain around 20–30% of these interindividual differences.

Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes constitute a polymorphic superfamily, consisting of 57 functional members in humans, that metabolize over 80% of all clinically used medications. Among these, CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 are of particular clinical relevance, being highly polymorphic and implicated in the metabolism of numerous widely prescribed drugs. CYP2C19 substrates include the tricyclic antidepressants amitriptyline, clomipramine, doxepin, and imipramine; the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors citalopram and sertraline; the antifungal voriconazole; as well as the antiplatelet agent clopidogrel. CYP2C19✱2 (rs4244285) is the most common allelic variant in Caucasians and results in aberrant splicing and loss of enzyme activity. In contrast, the regulatory polymorphism rs12248560, defining CYP2C19✱17, increases transcriptional activity and causes ultrarapid CYP2C19 metabolism.

### The pharmacological importance of cytochrome CYP3A4 in the palliation of symptoms: Review and recommendations for avoiding adverse drug interactions [^115Md2J6]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

Adverse drug interactions are major causes of morbidity, hospitalizations, and mortality. The greatest risk of drug interactions occurs through the cytochrome system. CYP3A4, the most prevalent cytochrome, accounts for 30–50% of drugs metabolized through type I enzymes.

- **Materials and methods**: Palliative patients received medications for symptoms and co-morbidities, many of which are substrates, inhibitors, or promoters of CYP3A4 activity and expression. A literature review on CYP3A4 was performed, focusing on palliative medicine.

- **Discussion**: In this state-of-the-art review, we discuss CYP3A4 genetics and kinetics and common medications that are substrates or inhibitors/promoters of CYP3A4.

- **Conclusion**: We made several recommendations for drug choices to avoid clinically important drug interactions.

### ABCB1 and cytochrome P450 genotypes and phenotypes: Influence on methadone plasma levels and response to treatment [^111gj1Ss]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2006). Low credibility.

The in vivo implication of various cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms and of P-glycoprotein on methadone kinetics is unclear. We aimed to thoroughly examine the genetic factors influencing methadone kinetics and response to treatment.

- **Methods**: Genotyping for CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, ABCB1, and UGT2B7 polymorphisms was performed in 245 patients undergoing methadone maintenance treatment. To assess CYP3A activity, the patients were phenotyped with midazolam.

- **Results**: The patients with lower CYP3A activity presented higher steady-state trough (R, S)-methadone plasma levels (4.3, 3.0, and 2.3 ng/mL x mg for low, medium, and high activity, respectively; p = 0.0002). As previously reported, CYP2B6✱6/✱6 carriers had significantly higher trough (S)-methadone plasma levels (P = 0.0001) and a trend toward higher (R)-methadone plasma levels (P = 0.07). CYP2D6 ultrarapid metabolizers presented lower trough (R, S)-methadone plasma levels compared with the extensive or intermediate metabolizers (2.4 and 3.3 ng/mL x mg, respectively; p = 0.04), whereas CYP2D6 poor metabolizer status showed no influence. ABCB1 3435TT carriers presented lower trough (R, S)-methadone plasma levels (2.7 and 3.4 ng/mL x mg for 3435TT and 3435CC carriers, respectively; p = 0.01). The CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A5, and UGT2B7 genotypes did not influence methadone plasma levels. Only CYP2B6 displayed a stereoselectivity in its activity.

- **Conclusion**: In vivo, CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 are the major CYP isoforms involved in methadone metabolism, with CYP2D6 contributing to methadone kinetics.

### Worldwide distribution of cytochrome P450 alleles: A meta-analysis of population-scale sequencing projects [^1133DR2V]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Drug response is highly variable between individuals, resulting in 40–70% of patients exhibiting a lack of efficacy of pharmacological treatment or adverse drug reactions. Importantly, it is estimated that 15–30% of this variability is caused by genetic polymorphisms. Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes and their roles in drug metabolism have been extensively studied and constitute major determinants of drug response, as they are responsible for 80% of phase 1 drug metabolism and 65–70% of drug clearance. Furthermore, metabolism by polymorphic phase 1 enzymes, primarily CYPs, has been implicated in an increased risk of adverse drug reactions.

The human CYP supergene family consists of 57 genes; however, 12 of the encoded enzymes are responsible for more than 75% of all phase 1 drug oxidation reactions. Importantly, these CYP genes are highly polymorphic and harbor a large repertoire of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and copy number variations. This diversity is primarily based on low evolutionary constraints due to the lack of essential endogenous functions of the encoded gene products and genetic drift. Although the vast majority of such polymorphisms are rare with minor allele frequencies (MAFs) < 1%, pharmacogenetic testing in clinics is currently restricted to validated and experimentally characterized variants for the derivation of qualified predictions about phenotypic consequences of the observed genetic variation patterns.

### The systems biology of drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters: Relevance to quantitative systems pharmacology [^114L2GXE]. Clinical pharmacology and therapeutics (2020). Low credibility.

Since their discovery, cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes — heme proteins that catalyze numerous so-called phase I chemical reactions, such as hydroxylation, oxidation, and reduction — have often been described as drug and toxicant metabolizing enzymes (phase I DMEs). The growing information regarding CYP450-mediated drug metabolism, alongside the knowledge of phase II conjugation pathways, including the UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) that catalyze the covalent linkage of glucuronic acid to substrates, has enabled the prediction of drug interactions at the metabolism level. This has led to safer prescriptions of certain drugs.

Furthermore, individualization of drug therapy is achieved through understanding genetic polymorphisms in DMEs that affect drug metabolism and, consequently, are linked to response or toxicity. Although this paper does not synthesize the extensive data on phase I and phase II DMEs in physiology, particularly regarding their links with transporters, it will highlight examples of how the endogenous roles of these enzymes connect to SLC and ABC transporters within certain physiological contexts.

### Genome-wide discovery of drug-dependent human liver regulatory elements [^114zXvP7]. PLoS Genetics (2014). Low credibility.

Adverse reactions to drug treatment constitute a substantial health problem that is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients. Differential expression of drug metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters is a major determinant of inter-individual drug response variability. By sequestering and metabolizing drug compounds in the liver and intestine, these enzymes and transporters effectively determine whether target organs and tissues are exposed to optimal drug dosages. Several coding mutations in these proteins have been detected, which lead to adverse outcomes and reduced drug activity. Regulatory elements, including promoters and enhancers, also likely play an important role that has so far been largely uncharacterized. The systematic identification of drug-responsive regulatory elements would thus provide a unique resource to discover novel genetic variants that lead to differences in drug response.

The vast majority of pharmaceutical compounds are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 family (CYP) of enzymes. Of these, CYP3A4 is the most abundantly expressed in sites of drug disposition in the liver and is also thought to be responsible for the metabolism of at least 50% of prescribed pharmaceuticals. CYP3A4 activity can vary 5–20 fold between individuals, and its mRNA expression can vary as much as 120 fold. Only a few single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the immediate CYP3A4 locus have been found to be associated with CYP3A4 hepatic expression, suggesting that its variable expression could be caused by other genes and distant regulatory elements.

### Brixadi [^112uNbN7]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Drug interaction studies largely focus on the role of CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers. The effects of co-administered CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers on buprenorphine exposure in subjects treated with Brixadi have not been specifically studied. However, such interactions have been established in studies using transmucosal buprenorphine. The effects of buprenorphine may be dependent on the route of administration.

Buprenorphine is metabolized to norbuprenorphine primarily by cytochrome CYP3A4. Therefore, potential interactions may occur when Brixadi is given concurrently with agents that affect CYP3A4 activity. The effects of co-administered CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors have been confirmed in studies using transmucosal buprenorphine. Patients switching to Brixadi treatment from a regimen with transmucosal buprenorphine used concomitantly with CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, macrolide antibiotics such as erythromycin, or HIV protease inhibitors) or a CYP3A4 inducer (e.g. phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampicin) should be monitored to ensure that the plasma buprenorphine level provided by Brixadi is adequate and not excessive [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Buprenorphine has been found to be a CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 inhibitor, and its major metabolite, norbuprenorphine, has been found to be a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor with in vitro studies employing human liver microsomes. However, plasma concentrations of buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine resulting from therapeutic Brixadi doses are not expected to significantly affect the metabolism, or systemic exposure, of other concomitantly administered medications.

### Evidence on buprenorphine dose limits: A review [^116gwa56]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

In a 2014 secondary analysis of a large data set, treatment retention at 24 weeks increased linearly with buprenorphine dose, reaching 60% in the 30- to 32-mg/d dose range. The linear relationship suggests that doses greater than 32 mg/d might further improve retention. Illicit opioid use decreased as buprenorphine dose increased.

Patients at higher buprenorphine doses had more consistent adherence to treatment in a 2020 study of prescription monitoring program data for 10,000 patients. Treatment adherence, defined as more than 80% of the first 180 days of treatment covered by prescriptions, was five times more likely among those whose last dose was ≥ 24 mg/d relative to those at < 16 mg/d.

People who inject opioids may especially benefit from higher buprenorphine doses, according to findings from a 2022 trial of monthly extended-release buprenorphine (XR-BUP) subcutaneous injections. Participants with a history of injection use were more likely to remain opioid-abstinent at the higher dose (300 mg monthly for 6 months) compared with the lower dose (300 mg monthly for 2 months, then 100 mg monthly for 4 months), whereas participants with no injection history experienced abstinence at the same rate on both regimens. The higher-dose XR-BUP resulted in an average plasma concentration higher than the average achieved with sublingual buprenorphine at 32 mg/d. XR-BUP may be more convenient than multiple daily doses of sublingual buprenorphine for some patients who prefer a higher dose range, although it can be difficult to access or obtain insurance coverage.

### Interactions between buprenorphine and antiretrovirals. II. The protease inhibitors nelfinavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ritonavir [^115MngaU]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

We examined drug interactions between buprenorphine, an opioid partial agonist available by prescription for the treatment of opioid dependence, and the protease inhibitors (PIs) nelfinavir (NFV), ritonavir (RTV), and lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/R). Opioid-dependent, buprenorphine/naloxone-maintained, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-negative volunteers (n = 10 per PI) participated in 24-hour pharmacokinetic studies before and after administration of each PI. Symptoms of opiate withdrawal and excess were determined before and after PI administration. PI pharmacokinetics were determined and compared between opiate-dependent participants and healthy control participants (n = 15 per PI).

Administration of RTV, but not of NFV or LPV/R, resulted in a significant increase in the buprenorphine area under the concentration-time curve (AUC). Symptoms of opiate excess, however, were not observed. Buprenorphine had no significant effects on PI AUC. Adjustments of doses of either buprenorphine or NFV, LPV/R, or RTV are not likely to be necessary when these drugs are administered for the treatment of opioid dependence and HIV disease.

### Apadaz [^1123LRa7]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Elimination**: Hydrocodone is eliminated primarily through the kidneys, while acetaminophen is principally eliminated via liver metabolism followed by renal excretion of its metabolites.

- **Metabolism**: Benzhydrocodone acts as a prodrug of hydrocodone, converting into active hydrocodone through enzymatic processes in the intestinal tract. Hydrocodone undergoes complex metabolism, including O-demethylation, N-demethylation, and 6-keto reduction to 6-α and 6-β-hydroxy metabolites. Hydromorphone, derived from the O-demethylation of hydrocodone, enhances the overall analgesic effect. This O- and N-demethylation is mediated by separate P-450 isoenzymes: CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, respectively [see Drug interactions (7)].

Acetaminophen metabolism primarily follows first-order kinetics in the liver, involving three main pathways: conjugation with glucuronide, conjugation with sulfate, and oxidation via a cytochrome P450-dependent, mixed-function oxidase enzyme pathway to produce a reactive intermediate metabolite. This metabolite conjugates with glutathione, ultimately forming cysteine and mercapturic acid conjugates. The principal cytochrome P450 isoenzyme involved is CYP2E1, with CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 serving as additional pathways.

### Genostar: An R package for genotype to star allele conversion for major cytochrome P450 family of genes [^114PddJL]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). High credibility.

Pharmacogenomics enables the personalization of drug therapy by linking genetic variations to differences in drug metabolism, efficacy, and risk of adverse reactions. Genetic polymorphisms within cytochrome P450 (CYP) genes significantly affect enzyme activity, influencing drug plasma levels, responses, and safety. Central to this process is accurate genotype-to-phenotype translation, especially for the CYP enzyme family, which metabolizes 70–80% of clinically used drugs.

To address this, we have developed Genostar, an R package that converts genotypes into star alleles and predicts the associated metabolizer status for major cytochrome P450 genes - CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and CYP3A5. Genostar assigns star alleles using single-nucleotide polymorphisms, insertion-deletion variants, and structural variants. Given genotype data, Genostar uses comprehensive allele definition tables to determine diplotypes, activity scores, and predicted metabolizer status. The tool accounts for complex scenarios, including CYP2D6 copy number variations, using a tiered matching strategy and structural variant detection.

We evaluated Genostar using two datasets:

- **Centre for Addiction and Mental Health Individualized Medicine: Pharmacogenetics Assessment and Clinical Treatment (IMPACT) study (n = 8,287)**: Included genotyping data, along with star allele information from a commercial pharmacogenetic test.
- **Toronto Schizophrenia sample (n = 188)**: Comprised in-house genotype data and manually validated star alleles.

Genostar achieved 100% concordance.
