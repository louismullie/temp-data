## Question

Doris earns $20 per hour by babysitting. She needs to earn at least $1200 for her monthly expenses. She can babysit for 3 hours every weekday and 5 hours on a Saturday. How many weeks does it take for Doris to earn enough to cover her monthly expenses?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how many weeks it will take Doris to earn at least $1200 given her babysitting rate and weekly schedule. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how much Doris earns per weekday and per Saturday. Then, I should calculate her total weekly earnings. Next, I will divide the monthly expense target by her weekly earnings to estimate the number of weeks required. Finally, I should verify whether partial weeks are acceptable or if we need to round up to whole weeks, and I will double-check the arithmetic to ensure accuracy.

> Let me first confirm the per-day earnings. Doris earns $20 per hour, so on a weekday she works 3 hours, which is 3 × $20 = $60 per weekday. On Saturday she works 5 hours, which is 5 × $20 = $100 per Saturday. Wait, let me verify that multiplication: 3 × 20 is indeed 60 and 5 × 20 is 100, so those daily totals are correct.

> Next, I should review the weekly total. There are 5 weekdays at $60 each, so 5 × $60 = $300, plus $100 on Saturday, giving a total of $300 + $100 = $400 per week. Hold on, I should double-check that addition: 300 + 100 is 400, so her weekly earnings are $400.

> Now, I will divide the monthly expense target by the weekly earnings to estimate weeks. $1200 ÷ $400 per week = 3 weeks exactly. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought this might imply 3.5 weeks, but that would be incorrect; 1200 divided by 400 is precisely 3, so 3 weeks suffices to meet the $1200 goal. I should confirm that the question allows partial weeks; since it asks "how many weeks", and 3 weeks yields exactly $1200, no rounding up is necessary in this case.

> Final answer: Doris will need 3 weeks of babysitting at this schedule to earn at least $1200.

Doris earns **$20/hour** and needs **$1,200/month**. She works 3 hours on each weekday and 5 hours on Saturday, totaling 20 hours/week. At $20/hour, she earns **$400/week**. To reach $1,200, she needs **3 weeks**.

---

## Weekly earnings calculation

- **Weekday earnings**: 3 hours/day × 5 days × $20/hour = $300
- **Saturday earnings**: 5 hours × $20/hour = $100
- **Total weekly earnings**: $300 + $100 = $400

---

## Weeks needed to reach $1,200

To find the weeks needed, divide the monthly goal by weekly earnings: $1,200 ÷ $400/week = **3 weeks**.

---

## Conclusion

Doris will need **3 weeks** of babysitting at her current schedule to earn at least $1,200.

### How babies sleep: demedicalising and humanising the issue for child health professionals [^06fd9296]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2025). High credibility.

The takeaway: trust babies, support parents

How Babies Sleep is a deceptively gentle book. Underneath its calm, practical tone is a powerful political argument: that infant sleep cannot be separated from maternal mental health, gender inequality or the economic structures that shape parenting.

The psychoanalyst Baraitser has written that maternal time disrupts capitalist rhythms: it is repetitive, unpredictable and emotionally intense. Night feeds and midnight wakings do not fit into productivity metrics. They demand a different value system — one based on interdependence and care.

For clinicians, Ball's book offers both a wake-up call and a toolkit. For parents, it is permission to stop blaming themselves — and start asking harder questions about the world we have built around babies.

The most revolutionary thing in this book is not the science — it is the solidarity. And perhaps, that is the real 'sleep solution' we have been searching for all along.

### Persistent short sleep duration from pregnancy to 2 to 7 years after delivery and metabolic health [^93d5556b]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Exposure: Sleep Duration Patterns

At study visits 1, 3, and 5, participants were asked about the timing of their sleep on weekdays or workdays and on weekends using the following 2 questions: "Not including naps, what time do you usually go to bed?" and "Not including naps, what time do you usually wake up?" In addition, participants were asked to estimate how many minutes it usually took for them to fall asleep at bedtime and how many minutes of wake time they typically had during a night's sleep. Calculated sleep duration was estimated as the interval from bedtime to wake time minus the time it took to fall asleep and the time awake during the night. This was separately calculated for weekdays or workdays and for weekends. Quality checks were done on the calculated sleep duration values for weekdays or workdays and for weekends using the following question from the sleep questionnaire: "How many hours of sleep do you usually get per night?" If the reported sleep duration from this additional question was not within 2 hours of the calculated sleep duration, then times used for the calculated sleep duration were run through a series of edit checks to identify and correct potential errors in the selection ofor. If the calculated duration was still not within 2 hours of the reported duration after editing potentialorerrors and recalculating sleep duration, the calculated duration and corresponding times were set to missing. Weekly mean sleep duration was calculated as a weighted mean of weekday or workday and weekend sleep durations using the following formula: ([weekday/workday duration × 5] + [weekend duration × 2])/7). Based on previous studies demonstrating the association of sleep duration in nonpregnant and pregnant individuals with health outcomes, we selected a cutoff of less than 7 hours a priori to define short sleep duration for our primary analyses. Using this cutoff, we categorized participants by 4 distinct patterns of sleep duration:

### Male / female differences in the impact of caring for elderly relatives on labor market attachment and hours of work: 1997–2015 [^aac99150]. The Journals of Gerontology: Series B, Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences (2020). Medium credibility.

Covariates Focused on Gendered Labor Market Participation

To examine these gendered labor market participation factors, we used the following variables which might be associated with informal care affecting labor market participation, and are potentially differentially distributed across male and female labor force participants.

The amount of sex segregation in the respondent's occupation operationalized as four groups (occupations with more than 70% men — most masculine; occupations 50%–69% men; occupations with 50%–69% women; occupations with 70% or more women — most feminine). Examples of the specific types of occupations worked by men and women within each of these categories are provided in Supplementary Table 2;
To determine if the respondent was likely the main wage earner in the household we used the reported weekly wages from the respondent, compared to the weekly wages of their partner (if applicable). If the respondent earned more than $150 more than their spouse per week ($7,800 per year) they were classified as the main income earner. If the respondent did not have a spouse, they were also classified as the main income earner. All other groups of respondents (those earning similar weekly wages as their spouse/partner, and those earning less) were classified as non–main income earners;
Hours of work: Based on the usual hours of work respondents were classified into the following groups: working 1–14 hr; working 15–34 hr; working 35–40 hr; working 41–49 hr; and working 50 or more hours. When examining leaving the labor market, we used the hours of work in the respondent's previous job (full-time vs part-time).

Models were also adjusted for the following labor market variables: If the respondent was working in a nonpermanent or in a permanent job (yes/no); if they were a member of a union or collective bargaining agreement (yes/no); how long they has been working in their current job (less than 1 year, 1–3 years, 3–5 years, 5–10 years, more than 10 years); and the number of employees at their workplace (less than 20 employees; 20–99 employees; 100–499 employees; more than 500 employees).

### Marriage, children, and sex-based differences in physician hours and income [^66452c9f]. JAMA Health Forum (2023). High credibility.

Methods

Data for this cross-sectional study came from the American Community Survey (ACS), administered by the US Census Bureau and surveying 1% of the US population each year between 2005 and 2019 (data collection in 2020 was affected by the pandemic and, therefore, not included). Each respondent reported demographic information, including age, sex, race and ethnicity, rural residence, marital status, and number of their own children living in the household, along with employment information, including occupation, industry, annual earnings, weeks worked per year, and hours worked per week. Physicians were associated with a hospital referral region (HRR) by mapping the public-use microarea of their residence available in the ACS to HRRs using MABLE/Geocorr, version 14 (University of Missouri). Between 9000 and 12 000 individuals reported their occupation as physician or surgeon each year. The ACS is an annual cross-sectional survey and does not include repeated observations on individual physicians. While the ACS provides detailed information on employment, earnings, demographic details, and family structure for a large representative sample of physicians, it does not include information on physician specialty.

Our sample was restricted to physicians who were working in the year of the survey, were between the ages of 25 and 64 years, reported their occupation as physician or surgeon, worked at least 20 hours per week and at least 48 weeks in the previous year, and had annual earnings of at least $10 000. Although many physicians are employed beyond age 64 years and few are younger than 30 years, we focused our analysis on age ranges where physicians might have children at home. Weeks worked included paid leave and when the physician worked only a few hours, so only 8.3% of all physicians reported working less than 48 weeks. Physicians with missing or imputed data for occupation, income, hours, weeks worked, age, sex, and marital status were excluded. The final sample included 95 435 physicians across all years studied.

Reduced income in non-hourly employees

Participants whose time at work was not scheduled in hourly shifts also experienced negative impacts to their take-home pay due to pregnancy. One participant, who worked for a small retail business, reported that her supervisor allowed her to make-up the missed work due to prenatal visits at another time so that her take-home pay was not impacted, but only during the business' " busy season". Otherwise, she had to take unpaid leave from work to attend prenatal visits. Another participant who works in real estate, had a flexible work schedule. However, since she was paid on commission, time away from work could still impact her take-home pay as she explained, " If I'm not there then I'm just not there [to earn money]. "

Many of the participants who worked in childcare reported positive experiences because they were able to balance work with prenatal and postpartum care. For one participant, the timing of her pregnancy meant that she could avoid reduced work hours. As the childcare worker explained, she did not have to take unpaid leave to attend prenatal visits since she disclosed her pregnancy during the summer, prior to the finalization of teaching assignments for the current school year. "I wanted to tell [supervisor] when my schedule was being like, figured out because I wanted to try and build in certain pockets of time when work was easier for me to get away for appointments". The participant further explained that she was then able to attend healthcare visits during her planning period and make-up the missed work time on her own to avoid any impacts to her take-home pay, since she requested the schedule changes before the school year started.

Workplace accommodations

Participants discussed accommodations that their employers and coworkers made in their workplace environment or within job duties during their pregnancies. These accommodations were sometimes a collaborative effort between the participant and her employer; in other situations they were employer-initiated based on the employer's perception of safe working conditions during pregnancy, and in other instances accommodations were medically recommended by an obstetrical care provider (Table 3).

### Long COVID and financial outcomes: evidence from four longitudinal population surveys [^9a866796]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2024). Medium credibility.

Sensitivity analysis

Analyses were re-weighted using population age composition weights to represent each cohort based on the actual distribution in the overall population. Highly similar estimates to the main analysis were found. Analysis of subjective financial well-being and benefit claim outcomes was also conducted using a four-category measure of long COVID where symptoms lasting between 4–12 weeks (ongoing symptomatic COVID-19) and 12+ weeks (post-COVID-19 syndrome) were combined into a single category (symptoms 4+ weeks). This sensitivity analysis was conducted to increase statistical power (as relatively low cell counts were seen in the post-COVID-19 syndrome category), demonstrating consistent findings to the main analyses. Finally, the exclusion of 996 participants who reported infection < 12 weeks prior to the third wave did not alter findings reported in the Results section.

Additional analysis was conducted to examine associations between OECD equivalised weekly household income during the pandemic (adjusting for retrospective pre-pandemic weekly household income) and a four-category measure of COVID severity. Results from this analysis suggest that those with COVID-19 symptoms which last longer than 4 weeks have decreased household income (see online supplemental materials 6, 7 for further details of sensitivity analyses).

Abbreviations: AOR, adjusted odds ratio (OR); CCA, complete case analysis; NA, not applicable; MI, multiple imputation; MS, missing smoking cessation considered to be smoking; PPA, carbon monoxide (CO)–verified point prevalence abstinence.

Incentives Earned

Participants assigned to UC plus FI earned a mean (SD) of $72 ($90) (median, $20 [IQR, $0-$145]) of $250 in available abstinence-contingent incentives over the first 12 weeks after the quit day. The total amount of abstinence-contingent incentives earned was $11 465, with a mean cost per quit of $521.14 (22 quits) with MS and $309.86 (37 quits) with MI based on 7-day PPA in the UC plus FI group at the 26-week follow-up.

Individual Characteristics Associated With Smoking Cessation

The following variables were examined in repeated measures analyses as factors associated with CO-verified 7-day PPA across assessment weeks (weeks 1–4, 8, 12, and 26) where MI was used to estimate missing smoking cessation outcomes: race and ethnicity, sexual orientation and gender identity, educational level, annual household income, insurance status, mean number of cigarettes smoked per day before the quit date, years of smoking, CO level before the quit date, HSI, and medication type. Analyses indicated that those with a household income of less than $11 000 were less likely to achieve 7-day PPA than those earning at least $11 000 across assessments (OR, 0.56 [95% CI, 0.39–0.81]). Higher baseline CO level was associated with a lower likelihood of cessation across assessments (OR, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.96–0.99]).

Table 1.
Respondent Characteristics

Nearly 30% of respondents (369 individuals [29.9%]) worked 60 or more hours per week, whereas among married or partnered women, 130 respondents (14.3%) reported that their partner worked 60 or more hours per week. Respondents reported bearing most household maintenance roles (eg, cleaning, buying groceries, cooking, and doing laundry), with married or partnered women ascribing a mean (SD) of 49.2% (20.7%) of these roles to themselves vs 40.5% (20.5%) to their spouses or partners. Among 660 married or partnered women with children, respondents similarly reported taking on a greater proportion of family maintenance roles (eg, childcare, eldercare, health care appointments, and school forms), assigning a mean of 58.4% (27.0%) to themselves vs 28.2% (22.3%) to their partners (Table 1).

### Substance use and delinquency among fifth graders who have jobs [^d62dafa6]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Working for pay is associated with substance use and delinquency among older adolescents, although information is scant about younger youth who work. This study investigates associations between self-reports of having a job and substance use and delinquent behaviors in a sample of U.S. 5th graders.

Methods

A total of 5147 5th graders and their parents from three large metropolitan areas were assessed in a cross-sectional survey between Fall 2004 and Summer 2006. Multivariate regression was used to estimate associations between having a job and substance use and delinquency. Analyses were conducted in Fall 2007.

Results

Twenty-one percent of 5th graders reported having a job, with most working < 5 hours per week. Typical jobs included yard work, babysitting, and cleaning. In multivariate models that controlled for demographic characteristics, household composition, and household income, having a job was significantly associated with past-30-day use of tobacco (OR = 2.2), alcohol (OR = 1.7), and marijuana (OR = 3.1). Having a job was also significantly associated with ever being in a fight (OR = 1.5) and with running away from home (OR = 1.8). Further analyses indicated that the associations between holding a job and delinquency outcomes were driven largely by young workers who worked > 2 hours per week.

Conclusions

Among 5th graders, having a job was associated with substance-using behaviors and delinquency. Clinicians should consider asking young patients whether they work, and stress to parents the importance of monitoring the work activities, workplaces, and associates of their children.

2. Earnings supplements

Participants in four studies received top‐ups to earned income when they worked for a specified number of hours per week or over a given period (New Hope 1999; SSP Applicants 2003; SSP Recipients 2002 (minimum 30 hours work per week, tapering above a certain level of earnings); UK ERA 2011 (up to six payments of GBP 400 for each period when participants worked 30 or more hours per week for 13 out of 17 weeks)). Supplements were limited to a period of three years. While supplements were being paid, respondents' total income could increase even if their earned income was low.

3. Earnings disregards

Five interventions disregarded a proportion of earned income when calculating welfare entitlement (CJF 2002; FTP 2000; IFIP 2002; IWRE 2002; MFIP 2000). Methods of calculating and levels of generosity varied across studies. Where earned income was disregarded, respondents could claim welfare while earning at much higher levels than previously. However, in CJF 2002, FTP 2000 and IWRE 2002, these periods while working and claiming welfare counted towards the respondent's lifetime limit on welfare receipt. While respondents received earnings disregards, total welfare receipt and numbers on welfare were higher. As with supplements, disregards could increase total income even if earned income was low.

4. Childcare subsidies

All but four interventions provided childcare subsidies (NEWWS 2001; SSP Applicants 2003; SSP Recipients 2002; UK ERA 2011). Financial contributions toward the cost of child care were made either directly to childcare providers or to parents for a period of one to two years following uptake of employment. Ontario 2001 provided a childcare programme to one arm of the intervention only.

### The economic burden experienced by carers of children who had a critical deterioration at a tertiary children's hospital in the United Kingdom (the DETECT study): an online survey [^472e931d]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Estimating productivity losses

Productivity losses were estimated using aggregate wage statistics. Information was collected for the median weekly earnings for full-time employees in the United Kingdom in 2020 3. These data distinguish the median weekly earnings by gender, and for seven different age groups, based on UK Office for National Statistics(ONS).

For each carer, the estimated weekly wage was adjusteded based on the carer gender and age group, according to ONS data. resulting in an estimated average weekly wage per carer of £441.

Productivity losses were estimated for three sets of carers. The first group included all carers who responded to the survey. The second group included the subset of working carers, either with a full-time or a part-time job. The third group included the subset of working carers with at least one missing workday (in the previous week).

### Financial incentives for smoking cessation among socioeconomically disadvantaged adults: a randomized clinical trial [^c3db4e08]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Usual Care

Participants were scheduled for a prequit counseling session with a tobacco treatment specialist and offered 5 additional weekly counseling sessions starting on the quit day. Counselors were not blinded to participant group assignment. Most participants (249 [77.8%]) were provided with combination nicotine replacement therapy (NRT; nicotine patches plus gum or lozenges) free of charge until 12 weeks after the quit day. Fewer participants used single NRTs (47 [14.7%]), no medication (21 [6.6%]), or other prescription medications or combinations (3 [0.9%]). Participants who were unwilling or unable to use NRT were evaluated by a collaborating physician and prescribed other pharmacotherapies (when appropriate) that were available free of charge at a campus pharmacy. All 320 participants were offered UC, and 161 were assigned to receive UC alone.

UC Plus FI

Participants assigned to UC plus FI (n = 159) were offered UC and had the opportunity to earn $250 in abstinence-contingent incentives in the form of department store gift cards (this is in addition to the aforementioned incentives earned for completing study surveys). Incentives were earned for (1) self-reported abstinence since 10on the evening prior to the scheduled quit day and/or self-reported abstinence during the past 7 days at weekly visits from 1 to 4 weeks after the quit day, combined with (2) a CO breath sample consistent with abstinence (CO < 10 ppm on the quit day and ≤ 6 ppm 1–4 weeks after the quit day). Participants earned $20 for CO-confirmed abstinence on the quit day, and this amount increased by $5 with each successive weekly abstinent visit through 4 weeks after the quit day (up to $150 total). Nonabstinent participants could earn incentives at their next visit, although the amount reset to $20. At the 8- and 12-week follow-ups, participants earned $50 per visit for self-reported past 7-day smoking abstinence with an expired CO level of no greater than 6 ppm. Incentives were delivered at the time of abstinence verification.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: whys, whens, and hows [^36a95ae0]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Many studies investigated dosing regimens in pediatric patients. One trial comparing 4 different daily dosages (400, 800, 1200, 1600 IU) found that all dosages established 25(OH)D concentrations of 50 nmol/L or greater in 97% to 98% of infants at age 3 and 12 months, but only a dosage of 1600 IU/d 25(OH)D levels to 75 nmol/L or greater in 97.5% of infants at age 3 months; nonetheless, this study was discontinued prematurely because of elevated plasma 25(OH)D concentrations that have been associated with hypercalcemia. Another study also found that 1600 IU/day given for 10 weeks to infants from 2 weeks to 3 months of age maintained a 25(OH)D concentration above 80 nmol/L, but without causing hypercalcemia or hypercalciuria.

Despite extensive knowledge on the functional, neurodevelopmental, behavioural and educational sequelae of preterm birth, relatively little is known about its economic consequences.

Objective

To systematically review evidence around the economic consequences of preterm birth for the health services, for other sectors of the economy, for families and carers, and more broadly for society.

Methods

Updating previous reviews, systematic searches of Medline, EconLit, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Embase and Scopus were performed using broad search terms, covering the literature from 1 January 2009 to 28 June 2017. Studies reporting economic consequences, published in the English language and conducted in a developed country were included. Economic consequences are presented in a descriptive manner according to study time horizon, cost category and differential denominators (live births or survivors).

Results

Of 4384 unique articles retrieved, 43 articles met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 27 reported resource use or cost estimates associated with the initial period of hospitalisation, while 26 reported resource use or costs incurred following the initial hospital discharge, 10 of which also reported resource use or costs associated with the initial period of hospitalisation. Only two studies reported resource use or costs incurred throughout the childhood years. Initial hospitalisation costs varied between $576972 (range $111152-$576 972) per infant born at 24 weeks' gestation and $930 (range $930-$7114) per infant born at term (US$, 2015 prices). The review also revealed a consistent inverse association between gestational age at birth and economic costs regardless of date of publication, country of publication, underpinning study design, follow-up period, age of assessment or costing approach, and a paucity of evidence on non-healthcare costs. Several categories of economic costs, such as additional costs borne by families as a result of modifications to their everyday activities, are largely overlooked by this body of literature. Moreover, the number and coverage of economic assessments have not increased in comparison with previous review periods.

Conclusion

Evidence identified by this review can be used to inform clinical and budgetary service planning and act as data inputs into future economic evaluations of preventive or treatment interventions. Future research should focus particularly on valuing the economic consequences of preterm birth in adulthood.

### Socioeconomic gradients in 24-hour movement patterns across weekends and weekdays in a working-age sample: evidence from the 1970 British cohort study [^96818359]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2024). Medium credibility.

Results

Sample characteristics

A total of 4894 individuals were included in analyses, of which 25.7% of individuals had no formal qualifications and 28.4% had a university degree or higher (table 1). Nearly half of the sample (47%) reported having a lower managerial/intermediate occupation, with ~15% falling under each routine/semiroutine or small employer/lower supervisory. Median weekly income was £692 per week (Q1, £378, and Q3, £1036). Approximately a quarter of individuals were in the lowest four deciles of IMD (27.0%), 21% in deciles 5–6, 25% in deciles 7–8 and 26.9% in deciles 9–10. Men were more likely to have no qualifications than women (28.9% vs 22.3%) and be in a lower IMD decile (49.7% vs 46.6% deciles 1–6), yet they were more likely to have a professional/managerial role (22.5% vs 11.6%) and higher income (29.0% vs 24.6% in the highest quartile; online supplemental table 1).

Table 1
Characteristics of included sample (n = 4894)

Average time spent in LIPA (4.7 ± 1.8 vs 4.7 ± 1.7 hours per day) or MVPA (1.3 ± 0.56 vs 1.3 ± 0.64 hours per day) was consistent across weekdays and weekend days; participants slept longer on weekends (7.7 ± 1.6 vs 7.0 ± 1.2 hours per day) and were more sedentary during weekdays (10.0 ± 2.2 vs 9.2 ± 2.1 hours per day; table 1, Composition 1). There were no differences in standing, moving, walking or combined high-intensity activity; however, individuals spent more time lying (2.0 ± 1.5 vs 1.6 ± 1.2 hours per day) on the weekend and more time sitting during the weekday (8.5 ± 2.4 vs 7.2 ± 2.2 hours per day; table 1, Composition 2).

### Commuting time to work and behaviour-related health: a fixed-effect analysis [^37a03a34]. Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Exposure

Information on time used for commuting was identically collected by surveys in 2-year intervals between 2008 and 2018 by requesting the hours used for commuting to work and back during a normal work week. The response alternatives were: 0 hours/week, 1–5 hours/week, 6–10 hours/week, 11–15 hours/week and > 15 hours/week. In the analyses, we excluded those reporting 0 hours/week and used the 1–5 hours/week as the reference group. In addition to the multicategory commuting time variable that was based on the response alternatives, analyses were conducted using a dichotomised commuting time variable categorised into > 5 vs 1–5 hours/week. Commuting > 5 hours/week corresponds on average to > 30 min/one-way commute on 5 days a week.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 733: employment considerations during pregnancy and the postpartum period [^a77dcfd8]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

Employment during pregnancy — U.S. workforce participation and return-to-work patterns are quantified: In 2015, 70% of all women with children younger than 18 years participated in the labor force; among pregnant women, 56% work full time during pregnancy, and 82% of nulliparous women continue to work to within the month before their due dates; most women (73%) return to work within 6 months after giving birth. The United States is the only developed country that does not have a national paid maternity or parental leave program. Obstetrician–gynecologists and other obstetric care providers can help pregnant women continue to work when it is safe for them to do so by requesting work modifications or accommodations when indicated.

VA/DoD pregnancy guideline — timing of scheduled delivery and antepartum testing specifies: We recommend offering scheduled delivery to patients who reach 41 weeks and 0/7 days undelivered, and Antepartum fetal testing should begin at 41 weeks and 0/7 days if not delivered. This is categorized as Not reviewed, Amended, and the Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was moderate in support of offering scheduled delivery for people undelivered at 41 weeks 0/7 days for the outcome of decreased perinatal mortality, noting benefits of delivery by 41 weeks such as decreased cesarean section rates and reduced perinatal mortality.

Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). High credibility.

Patient and caregiver costs and treatment burden in atopic dermatitis (AD) are substantial. Survey data report that "the median annual AD out-of-pocket expense was $600; 42% of patients with AD reported greater than $1000 out-of-pocket expenses annually and 9% reported out-of-pocket expenses greater than $5000 per year", and that "Higher out-of-pocket expenses are associated with increased disease severity and flares". Treatment intensity is common: "many patients with AD use, including concurrently, at least 3 prescription therapies", and cost gaps are frequent as "Nearly half of all study respondents (49%) reported out-of-pocket costs for prescription medications that were not covered by insurance". Caregiving demands are high, with "Caregivers of children with moderate-to-severe AD reported spending an average 20 hours per week managing the disease".

### The impact of occupational shift work and working hours during pregnancy on health outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^f998ccc6]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). Medium credibility.

Backgroud

An increasing number of original studies suggest that exposure to shift work and long working hours during pregnancy could be associated with the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, but the results remain conflicting and inconclusive.

Objective

To examine the influences of shift work and longer working hours during pregnancy on maternal and fetal health outcomes.

Data Sources

Five electronic databases and 3 gray literature sources were searched up to March 15, 2019.

Methods Of Study Selection

Studies of all designs (except case studies and reviews) were included, which contained information on the relevant population (women who engaged in paid work during pregnancy); exposure (rotating shift work [shifts change according to a set schedule], fixed night shift [typical working period is between 11:00 pm and 11:00 am] or longer working hours [> 40 hours per week]); comparator (fixed day shift [typical working period is between 8:00 am and 6:00 pm] or standard working hours [≤ 40 hours per week]); and outcomes (preterm delivery, low birthweight [birthweight < 2500 g], small for gestational age, miscarriage, gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction, stillbirth, and gestational diabetes mellitus).

Tabulation, Integration, and Results

From 3305 unique citations, 62 observational studies (196,989 women) were included. "Low" to "very low" certainty evidence from these studies revealed that working rotating shifts was associated with an increased odds of preterm delivery (odds ratio, 1.13; 95% confidence interval, 1.00–1.28, I² = 31%), an infant small for gestational age (odds ratio, 1.18, 95% confidence interval, 1.01–1.38, I² = 0%), preeclampsia (odds ratio, 1.75, 95% confidence interval, 1.01–3.01, I² = 75%), and gestational hypertension (odds ratio, 1.19, 95%confidence interval, 1.10–1.29, I² = 0%), compared to those who worked a fixed day shift. Working fixed night shifts was associated with an increased odds of preterm delivery (odds ratio, 1.21; 95% confidence interval, 1.03–1.42; I² = 36%) and miscarriage (odds ratio, 1.23; 95% confidence interval, 1.03–1.47; I² = 37%). Compared with standard hours, working longer hours was associated with an increased odds of miscarriage (odds ratio, 1.38; 95% confidence interval, 1.08–1.77; I² = 73%), preterm delivery (odds ratio, 1.21; 95% confidence interval, 1.11–1.33; I² = 30%), an infant of low birthweight (odds ratio, 1.43; 95% confidence interval, 1.11–1.84; I² = 0%), or an infant small for gestational age (odds ratio, 1.16, 95% confidence interval, 1.00–1.36, I² = 57%). Dose-response analysis showed that women working more than 55.5 hours (vs 40 hours) per week had a 10% increase in the odds of having a preterm delivery.

Conclusion

Pregnant women who work rotating shifts, fixed night shifts, or longer hours have an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes.

### Implications of childhood autism for parental employment and earnings [^764b9dfe]. Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine changes in parental labor force participation, hours of work, and annual earnings associated with childhood autism spectrum disorders (ASD).

Methods

We used the 2002–2008 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey to examine parental labor market outcomes of children with ASD relative to children with another health limitation and children without health limitations. A logit model was used to estimate parental labor force participation. A tobit model was used to estimate parental hours of work and earnings.

Results

On average, mothers of children with ASD earn 35% ($7189) less than the mothers of children with another health limitation and 56% ($14755) less than the mothers of children with no health limitation. They are 6% less likely to be employed and work 7 hours less per week, on average, than mothers of children with no health limitation. There were no statistically significant differences in fathers' labor market outcomes across 3 groups. On average, children with ASD are 9% less likely to have both parents working. Family earnings of children with ASD are 21% ($10416) less than those of children with another health limitation and 28% ($17763) less than those of children with no health limitation. Family weekly hours of work are an average of 5 hours less than those of children with no health limitation.

Conclusions

Families of children with ASD face significant economic burden. Given the substantial health care expenses associated with ASD, the economic impact of having lower income in addition to these expenses is substantial. It is essential to design universal health care and workplace policies that recognize the full impact of autism.

### How much Do formula-fed infants take in the first 2 days? [^6d87e123]. Clinical Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To document the intake of exclusively formula-fed newborns during the first 2 days of life.

Methods

We enrolled a cohort of 50 healthy newborns ≥ 37 weeks' gestation and documented their daily formula intake until discharge. We surveyed pediatricians regarding their assessment of the intake of formula fed infants.

Results

In all, 37 of 50 newborns stayed for at least 48 hours. The mean ± SD gestational age was 39.5 ± 0.88 weeks. Mean ± SD formula intake for the first 48 hours (n = 37) was 57.2 ± 20.4 mL/kg/d and mean weight loss at 45.7 ± 8.8 hours, was 2.7% of birth weight. Pediatricians underestimated the amounts taken by these infants.

Conclusions

In the first 2 days, healthy term newborns, fed formula ad lib, consume about 115 mL/kg, about 2 to 3 times as much as breastfed infants, and they lose only 2.7% of their birthweight by 48 hours. Most pediatricians underestimate the intake of formula-fed infants.

### The global comparators project: international comparison of 30-day in-hospital mortality by day of the week [^5bdb754c]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2015). Medium credibility.

Other possible explanations

The increased mortality associated with weekend emergency and elective admissions is multifactorial, and, as already pointed out, may also be specific to those diagnoses and procedures that are particularly sensitive to hospital services being reduced/absent on Saturdays and Sundays. Weekend patients may be subject to reduced and unsuitably skilled staff (less available senior staff, junior doctors in training) as well as reduced availability of diagnostics. Urgent cases needing prompt treatment on a weekend might be subject to unnecessary wait, leading to adverse outcomes. Rota changes and unfamiliar junior doctors might also count towards patient disadvantage. All of these factors are likely to negatively affect patient outcomes who are admitted on weekends reflecting the quality of care provided by hospitals.

### Costs and cost-effectiveness of periviable care [^7df356cf]. Seminars in Perinatology (2014). Low credibility.

With increasing concerns regarding rapidly expanding healthcare costs, cost-effectiveness analysis allows assessment of whether marginal gains from new technology are worth the increased costs. Particular methodologic issues related to cost and cost-effectiveness analysis in the area of neonatal and periviable care include how costs are estimated, such as the use of charges and whether long-term costs are included; the challenges of measuring utilities; and whether to use a maternal, neonatal, or dual perspective in such analyses. A number of studies over the past three decades have examined the costs and the cost-effectiveness of neonatal and periviable care. Broadly, while neonatal care is costly, it is also cost effective as it produces both life-years and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). However, as the gestational age of the neonate decreases, the costs increase and the cost-effectiveness threshold is harder to achieve. In the periviable range of gestational age (22–24 weeks of gestation), whether the care is cost effective is questionable and is dependent on the perspective. Understanding the methodology and salient issues of cost-effectiveness analysis is critical for researchers, editors, and clinicians to accurately interpret results of the growing body of cost-effectiveness studies related to the care of periviable pregnancies and neonates.

Further defining this time frame should be individualized by facilities and regions, and if referring to a service, the service should be available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week unless otherwise specified.

Table 4 presents ordinary least squares estimates for the number of hours taken off work in the last week, only among those respondents who had taken a temporary absence (n = 4,572). No statistical differences were observed between men and women or across survey years in the first model. After adjustment for various work status measures women took just more than 2.5 hr more off work than men. The hours a respondent usually worked was associated with the time taken off work, with respondents who worked more hours per week having to take more hours off work, than respondents who worked fewer hours. No differences were observed across main income earner status, or occupational segregation measures.

For each of the earlier analyses we also examined if the increasing trend for each outcome over time differed for men compared to women, using a multiplicative interaction term between sex and survey year. This interaction was only statistically significant for the outcome of permanently leaving the labor market, with the interaction term suggesting the increase in the outcome over time was stronger among men (10% increased likelihood per year) compared to women (2% increased likelihood per year).

### Joint consensus statement of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine and sleep research society on the recommended amount of sleep for a healthy adult: methodology and discussion [^0080747a]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Recommended amount of sleep for a healthy adult — measurement considerations and ecological validity emphasize that real-world sleep patterns can produce circadian disruption "equivalent to taking a 2–3 hour "flight" westward on Friday night… only to "fly" back on Sunday night — waking earlier than desired Monday morning". The panel notes "the heterogeneity of sleep duration measurement", with "retrospective self-report, the most common method in epidemiologic studies and in clinical practice", that is easy but limited as "sleep duration can vary substantially over time", questions "may capture time in bed rather than time asleep", and "self-reported sleep duration often differs considerably from objective measures". Among objective tools, "Actigraphy has better sensitivity (detecting sleep) than specificity (detecting wake)" and "often overestimates sleep duration", while "PSG is the only common method that directly measures brain activity", yet is "more intrusive… may interfere with the very thing it measures", is "expensive and less well-suited" for large, home, or multi-night studies; emerging "consumer sleep technologies may create opportunities for accurate, reliable, scalable objective sleep duration assessment".

### Childhood injuries and food stamp benefits: an examination of administrative data in one US state [^a55a164e]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

In Table 2, we split the sample by earned income status and examine the relationship between the timing of SNAP benefits and the calendar week of the ER claim to see if having access to other sources of income allows SNAP households to smooth their consumption more easily and avoid fluctuations in the risk of childhood injuries. Our results were similar to the ones found in Table 1. While, we observe that households with no earnings have a lower risk of submitting an ER claim in the last week of the calendar month in comparison to households with some earnings, the difference between these two effects was not statistically significant. Similarly, the risk of submitting an ER claim in other weeks of the calendar month was statistically similar for those with no earnings in comparison to those with some earnings.

" I was just laid off yesterday… due to my limits and restrictions from the doctors… I was put on a ten-pound lifting limit, which is very, very small and unfortunately with all the job descriptions at my employer I wasn't eligible for employment anymore. I busted my butt at that place and gave it everything that I had, even very sick and ill and not well and they, I feel like they tossed me in the trash".

When another participant started a new job as a nurse, she found her new employer was unwilling to accommodate job duty recommendations from her healthcare provider:

"I told her like maybe on day seven that I had a nurse's note and when she told me that she was not going to accommodate it, I just basically let her know like, 'well I can't continue to work here. Like I need to', you know in the note it says like okay well, 'I need to be able to take frequent breaks like to sit down, I can't stand for longer than two hours, I should be able to take water breaks, bathroom breaks and stuff like that'. She had a whole attitude about it and told me that she was not going to accommodate my nurse's note so I was like 'okay, you're not going to accommodate my nurse's note like so you want me to put myself and my baby in danger; no thank you, you can keep this job'.

Ultimately, the participant quit the new job because the employer would not accommodate the requests in her healthcare provider's note.

Jet lag — timed melatonin use notes that melatonin is secreted by the pineal gland in the brain during darkness and it is suppressed during the day with light exposure. Under a typical sleep-wake schedule without rapid travel across time zones, melatonin is secreted for approximately 12 hours at night — melatonin secretion starts to increase in the early evening about 2 hours before normal bedtime and peak plasma concentration occurs at approximately 3–4 a.m. Taking melatonin when the internal clock thinks it is morning will result in a phase delay which can facilitate adaptation to westward travel, whereas taking it when the internal clock thinks it is early evening will result in a phase advance which can facilitate adaptation to eastward travel. It is important to appropriately plan melatonin as taking it at the wrong time can increase misalignment, and taking melatonin when endogenous melatonin is high (body clock time 12–5 a.m.) is not as effective. Melatonin dosages vary, but 0.5–1 mg is often sufficient to produce a circadian shift.

### Progress toward self-sufficiency for low-wage workers-HHS ASPE… [^daf1edda]. aspe.hhs.gov (2010). Low credibility.

A considerable body of research on low-wage workers has emerged in recent years. Although there is no single, standard definition of the term low-wage worker, various approaches produce qualitatively similar findings, about $10 an hour in current dollars. Most studies establish a low-wage line, analogous to the federal poverty threshold. Today their low-wage line would be slightly over $10 an hour. The Congressional Budget Office sets its low-wage line using a relative rather than an absolute standard. CBO defines low wages as those that fall below the 20th percentile in the wage distribution. In 2005, the CBO approach resulted in a low-wage line of about $9. 00 an hour, or about $10 today. Key Definitions Low-Wage Workers: As noted above, there is no single definition of what constitutes a low-wage rate, but many different approaches produce quite consistent results.

For this study, we follow Schochet and Rangarajans approach and set the low-wage threshold at the hourly wage required for a full-time, full-year worker to earn enough to keep a family of four out of poverty. The government benefits considered include benefits received from the EITC, child care assistance, transportation assistance, TANF, and Food Stamp programs; and we examine the ratio of family earned income to family needs low-wage workers in families with higher earnings-to-needs ratios are more self-sufficient in that their earned income covers a greater share of their needs. This measure of self-sufficiency captures how well off low-wage workers families are in the absence of any government support. A benefit of this second measure is that it uses family need, rather than receipt of government assistance, as the benchmark for self-sufficiency.

We also examine changes in the composition of income over time. In addition to broadly looking at government benefit receipt, we present the share of families receiving assistance through specific government programs: TANF, food stamps, child care assistance, transportation assistance, and the EITC. Second, we assess the level and changes in low-wage workers family self-sufficiency index. We present the self-sufficiency index over time by work support receipt and income level.

### US public opinion regarding proposed limits on resident physician work hours [^8dddf7f1]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Public opinions on resident physician work hour regulation

When asked about specific IOM proposal packages, four out of five respondents supported a proposal that included limiting the duration of individual work shifts to 16 h, capping weekly work hours at a maximum of 80 h in any single week and ensuring that medical residents have at least 1 day off per week (Table 3). Of note, 67% of the subgroup of respondents who were health care workers supported this proposal, as did 83% of the subgroup who were health care workers' family members. Among the 20% of the overall respondents who withheld their support for this proposal (opposed or undecided), 44% did so because they thought that the proposal did not go far enough in limiting resident physician work hours. Thus, 89% either supported a proposal with this or stricter work hour limits.

When asked about individual components of the IOM recommendations (Table 4), three-quarters or more of respondents: (1) supported the IOM-proposed 16 h per shift limitation; (2) supported the alternative IOM recommendation requiring that at least 5 h of protected sleep be provided during a 30-h shift; (3) supported the IOM proposal that work hours be capped at no more than 80 h in any single week; (4) supported the IOM proposal that hospitals be required to provide safe transportation home, such as a taxi or public transit ticket, for residents too fatigued to drive home safely; and (5) did not believe that resident physicians should be allowed to work jobs outside of the hospital in their off hours during their training (Table 4). Two-thirds of respondents favored a 16-h maximum shift duration over the alternative IOM recommendation requiring 5 h of protected time for sleep. More than 90% of respondents supported the establishment of strict rules to ensure that medical residents are provided with direct, on-site supervision by more experienced doctors (Table 4).

### Commuting time to work and behaviour-related health: a fixed-effect analysis [^6c440bd0]. Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Covariates

As covariates, we selected factors acknowledged in prior literature to be related to commuting activities or health behaviours. Demographic variables age and occupational position (low, intermediate, high, self-employed) were from registers. Information on civil status (married/cohabiting vs not) and all other possible covariates were self-reported. Presence of children was defined as reporting having one or more children under 12 years. Working hours were reported as weekly hours; number of hours in 2008, by 5-hour categories in 2010 (starting from < 35 hour/week), by 10 hours categories in 2012 and 2014 (starting from < 10 hours/week), and by 5-hour categories in 2016 (starting from < 10 hours/week). Short working hours were defined as < 30 hours/week, except for year 2010 where this category was < 35 hour/week. Normal working hours were 30–40 hours/week (for 2010 36–40 hours/week), and longer than normal hours were defined as > 40 hours/week.

A REMINDER FOR THOSE ON 28-DAY PACKS

If you forget any of the 7 white "reminder" pills in Week 4: THROW AWAY the pills you missed. Keep taking 1 pill each day until the pack is empty. You do not need a back-up method.

FINALLY, IF YOU ARE STILL NOT SURE WHAT TO DO ABOUT THE PILLS YOU HAVE MISSED:

Use a BACK-UP METHOD anytime you have sex.

KEEP TAKING ONE "ACTIVE" PILL EACH DAY until you can reach your healthcare professional.

How to Use the Blister Cards for the 21 Tablets

The blister pack comes to you set up for Sunday Start. If your healthcare professional has instructed you to start pill-taking on the SUNDAY after your menstrual period has begun, or if your period begins on Sunday you will take your first pill that very same day. Start with the Sunday pill in row #1. After the Saturday pill has been taken, begin taking the pills in row #2, and so on, until all 21 pills have been taken. You will then take no pills for one week (seven days).
If you start pill-taking on a day other than SUNDAY, peel the attached sticker by selecting the day of the week you plan to start. Place the sticker over the pre-printed days of the week and make sure it lines up with the pills. This sticker will help to remind you to take your pill every day. Take the yellow pill which corresponds to the day in row #1 for the 1/35 day regimen of the first pack during the first 24 hours of your period.
After the last (Saturday) pill in row #3 has been taken, if any remain in the first row, complete your 21-pill schedule by taking one pill daily starting with Sunday in row #1 until all the pills have been taken.
When you start taking the pill for the first time, use an additional method of protection until you have taken your first 7 pills.
Your tablet dispenser consists of three parts, the foil pouch, wallet, and a blister pack containing 21 individually sealed pills. Note that the pills are arranged in three numbered rows of 7 pills each with the days of the week printed above them. All 21 pills are "active" birth control pills.
You must take your pills in order, one pill each day at intervals of 24 hours. To remove a pill, push down on the pill with your thumb and forefinger so that the pill releases through the back of the dispenser. See diagram below:
Proceed taking one pill each day until all pills have been taken.
After you have taken your last pill, wait for 7 days. During this time your period should begin.
On the eighth day, start a new pack of pills even if your period is not yet over.

### Earnings of employed and self-employed US health care professionals, 2001 to 2015 [^9316e19e]. JAMA Network Open (2018). Medium credibility.

Methods

We used data from the nationally representative American Community Survey (ACS) collected between 2001 and 2015. The response rate for this survey was more than 90%. This study followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guidelines. Institutional review board approval was not required because the study used publicly available data.

Our analysis was limited to respondents aged 30 years and older who worked at least 40 weeks in the previous year and at least 20 hours per week and had positive annual labor earnings. We defined earnings as the sum of self-employment and wages or salary income. Using the all-items Consumer Price Index, we inflated earnings to 2015 dollars. Employed health care professionals were those who self-reported that they were employed in private for-profit or nonprofit organizations. Self-employed professionals were those who self-reported that they were self-employed in an incorporated or unincorporated business or professional practice. We grouped federal, state, and local government employees together in a separate category. Survey respondents could choose only 1 response to the employment type question in the ACS.

We examined trends in employment type and median annual labor earnings in 5-year increments (2001–2005, 2006–2010, and 2011–2015). The ACS top-codes reported income at the 99.5 percentile for each state. To mitigate possible bias from top-coding, following Seabury et al, we estimated a median regression model to estimate the earnings gap (self-employed minus employed earnings) by profession, adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, year, and state of residence. We used a significance threshold of.05 using a 2-sided test.

### How many paid sick days are enough? [^ff990f9d]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

This study analyzes the relationship between number of paid sick days and reported preventive health care service usage among older US workers.

Methods

Using a 2014 cross-section of 3235 US workers age 49 to 57 from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, this study is the first to measure paid sick leave as an ordinal variable in an effort to refine our understanding of sick leave, and identify the ideal range of sick days necessary for people to access preventive health care services.

Results

We find workers with 10 or more paid sick days have increased odds of reporting five different preventive health care services.

Conclusion

To support worker and public health, policy planners may want to consider the number of paid sick days that are needed before changes in preventive service use are observed.

The mean sleep debt was 0.73 hour (95% CI, 0.68–0.77 hour); 30.5% (95% CI, 26.8%-33.3%) of adults accumulated at least 1 hour of sleep debt per week, and 9.75% (95% CI, 8.65%-10.8%) accumulated at least 2 hours per week (Figure 2 and eTable 6 in the Supplement); 15.0% (95% CI, 13.0%-16.9%) had negative relative sleep debt (Figure 2). Similar distributions were observed when sleep debt was expressed as the absolute difference in sleep duration between work and free days, with the least sleep debt among older adults (eTable 7 and eFigure 2 in the Supplement). The mean social jet lag was 1.10 hours (95% CI, 1.05–1.15 hours), 46.5% (95% CI, 42.6%-50.3%) of adults had at least 1 hour of social jet lag per week, and 19.3% (95% CI, 17.7%-20.9%) had at least 2 hours jet lag per week (Figure 3 and eTable 8 in the Supplement); 6.54% (95% CI, 4.09%-9.04%) had negative relative social jet lag (Figure 3). The estimated prevalence of trouble sleeping was 29.8% (95% CI, 28.2%-31.5%), and that of daytime sleepiness was 27.2% (95% CI, 25.0%-29.5%) (Table 2).

### Using linked federal and state data to study the adequacy of workers' compensation benefits [^2c87452a]. American Journal of Industrial Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

The New Mexico workers' compensation system requires that all firms with 3 or more employees either self-insure or buy insurance in the private market. In 1997, workers' compensation benefits as a percent of covered wages in New Mexico ranked 38 th of the 50 states. To become eligible for temporary disability benefits, individuals must have been off work for more than 7 days. Such workers are paid a "compensation rate" of two-thirds of their pre-injury wages up to the New Mexico compensation maximum, which is based on average wages within the state. Among the state workers' compensation systems, this is the most common way of calculating the compensation rate. Before 2000, the maximum was 85 percent the State Average Weekly Wage. Beginning in 2000, the maximum was 100 percent of the State Average Weekly Wage. For permanently disabling injuries, payment depends upon whether the injury is categorized as a "whole body" ("unscheduled") injury (typically involving back and neck injuries) or a "scheduled" injury (typically an injury to a finger, hand, arm, or leg). Workers with whole body injuries receive the weekly compensation rate on a weekly basis for a percentage of 500 weeks (or 700 weeks if the disability rating is greater than 80 percent). The percentage depends on the degree of impairment, as measured by the American Medical Association Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment. For injured workers who earn less than their pre-injury earnings, other factors may raise the number of weeks benefits are paid. In contrast, "scheduled" benefits provide compensation for an fixed number of weeks for a worker with complete loss of use of particular body member, ranging from seven to 200 weeks.

Person-Time and Expertise Required to Implement and Maintain CDC EWARS

The CDC EWARS team was formed January 20, 2020, starting with 1 person and eventually expanding to a 7-person team (Table 2); all members had at least a master's degree. The team's growth coincided with the increase in global case counts and increased number of countries reporting cases. Team members worked an average of 8.2 hours/day, 7 days/week (Table 2), but various team members still worked considerable overtime (i.e. > 40 hours/week), from 5–45 hours of overtime per person per week. The weekly total person-hours increased from 70 in EW 3 to 345 in EW 9, for a 7-day workweek; 1,726 person-hours were required to develop and maintain the CDC EWARS system.

BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

Allocation of treatment and blinding

After obtaining maternal consent, randomisation is performed just before the second injection, using a web-based application and a secured access, in a one-to-one ratio to the full or half dose groups according to a computer-generated list of randomly permuted blocks. The randomisation is stratified by maternity units and gestational age (before or after 28 weeks). The randomisation list is centrally computer-generated and a web-based application ensures proper allocation concealment. The allocation sequence is not available to any member of the research team until the database will be completed and locked. Patients, care providers and outcome assessors are masked to assignment. A study number is allocated to the woman corresponding to a treatment pack, each of which looks identical and contains two opaque study-labeled vials.

Unblinding procedures

Unblinding will be requested for any reason considered essential by the investigating doctor by calling upon:
the DRCD in a situation other than an emergency during the work day and during working hours, addressed to the DRCD's project referent.
the poison centre of Fernand Widal Hospital, in the case of an emergency (see emergency situations requiring unblinding), on weekends, bank holidays, when the DRCD is closed and when unblinding cannot be carried out at the DRCD

Women follow-up

Women will be followed from randomisation to delivery.

Neonatal follow-up

Follow-up visit on Day1, 48 h after birth, Day2 to Day7, and Day28 will be performed by the neonatologists in the neonatology units for preterm neonates and on Day 1 and 48 h after birth by neonatologists in the postpartum units for full term neonates. During these visits, neonatologists will assess vital and ventilation parameters of the newborns, the primary and secondary outcome measures. The last research visit will take place in the postpartum units the day of hospital discharge for full term neonates and in the neonatology units not after 37 weeks of postmenstrual age (PMA) for neonates born preterm. At this visit, secondary outcome measures will be assessed by the neonatologists.

Long-term children follow-up

Neurodevelopmental assessment of children by certified neuropsychologists is planned at 3 years of age, but is not part of the present protocol.

### When do newborns die? A systematic review of timing of overall and cause-specific neonatal deaths in developing countries [^a9d67ee8]. Journal of Perinatology (2016). Low credibility.

Data abstraction and synthesis

The following list depicts the steps used to summarize the data from the included studies.

We first made a master chart with the day of life in columns and different studies in rows. For the first week of life, we made columns for each day — that is, day 0, day 1 and so on. For the next 3 weeks, we made columns for the week(s) rather than days (week 2 and weeks 3 to 4), as it was unlikely that the studies would have provided daily mortality rates for the second week onwards.
As it was likely that different studies would have used different terminologies to describe the day of birth, we assumed the following to ensure uniformity across the studies: We considered 0 to 23 h as day 0 of life, 24 to 47 h as day 1, 48 to 71 h as day 2 and so on for studies that mentioned the age in hours. For studies that did not mention the age in hours but reported it as < 1 day, day 1, day 2 and so on, < 1day was considered as 'day 0'. For those studies that did not report either of these two, we examined whether they had reported days 1 to 28 or days 0 to 27 as the neonatal period. For studies reporting deaths from days 1 to 28, we considered day 1 of the study to be 'day 0' for our analysis. Similarly, day 2 was considered as 'day 1', day 3 as 'day 2' and so on. For studies that reported deaths from day 0 to day 27, we used the data as such — that is, day 0 of the study is 'day 0'. For those studies that provided data for 0 to 28 days, we included day 7 figures in the data for the second week.
We then attempted to pool the data for different time points. For pooling, we included only those studies that provided data for at least three time points in the first 4 weeks of life (for example, day 1, day 2 and days 3 to 28; days 1 to 3, days 4 to 7, days 8 to 28; and so on). Studies that provided data for only two time points were simply enumerated in the table but not included in the final analysis.
Pooling of the data was done in three steps: Initially, the data from those studies that provided data for all the time points were pooled to obtain the summary estimate (proportion) for each time point. We then used this summary estimate to calculate the proportion for the missing time points in the other studies (extrapolation). For example, if a study provided data for day 1, day 2 and days 3 to 28, we split the data of 3 to 28 days into data for day 3, day 4, day 5, day 6, week 2 and weeks 3 to 4 based on the proportion obtained from step (i) for these time points. The data — original and extrapolated — were pooled again to obtain the final estimate for each time point.
We made the final graph based on the pooled result for each day in the first week and also for week 1, week 2 and weeks 3 to 4.
For cause-specific mortality, the same steps were carried out for each of the major outcomes — asphyxia, prematurity, sepsis/pneumonia/diarrhea, congenital malformations and others. The denominator was the total number of deaths secondary to a particular cause (for example, asphyxia) while the numerator was the number of deaths due to that cause on a given day.

### Committee opinion no. 688: management of suboptimally dated pregnancies [^43191355]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Suboptimally dated pregnancy — definition and dating thresholds — The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists considers first-trimester ultrasonography to be the most accurate method to establish or confirm gestational age, and pregnancies without an ultrasonographic examination confirming or revising the estimated due date before 22 0/7 weeks of gestation should be considered suboptimally dated. A recommended 22-week cutoff replaces a historic 20 weeks of gestation threshold, supported by the rationale that a discrepancy of more than 10 days applies from 16 0/7 weeks through 21 6/7 weeks of gestation, and this aligns with the recommendation that the optimal time for a single ultrasonographic examination is at 18–22 weeks of gestation.

Child life staffing availability and allocation — benchmark use and planning factors include that productivity data allow hospitals to compare programs and adjust staffing to patient volumes, and child life services should be available 7 days per week. Staffing plans should be sufficient to meet fluctuations in staff absences, seasonal census swings, and community activities. Although national ratios establish trends, other factors should influence allocations; child, family, and diagnosis/treatment variables affect needs, and combined psychosocial, medical/treatment, and time requirements directly affect staff-to-patient ratios and could necessitate a lower ratio of patients to child life specialist.

### Prevalence of overnight work (1 a.M. to 5 a.M.) among United States workers [^42037ed1]. American Journal of Industrial Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

2.2.3 Health Status and Health Behaviors

Health status and health behaviors included self‐reported health, leisure‐time physical activity, sleep, smoking, and alcohol use. Self‐reported health was categorized as excellent/very good, good, and fair/poor. Psychometric studies recommend combining "excellent" and "very good" categories to achieve better linear fit with the general health evaluation concept, because the difference between these two categories is significantly smaller than between other categories. Sleep was ascertained by the question "On average, how many hours of sleep do you get in a 24‐h period?". We used "7–9 h" as the reference category, based on sleep duration recommendations for healthy adults to promote optimal health.

The NHIS categorized leisure‐time physical activities as "vigorous" or "light or moderate" based on self‐reported usual weekly frequency and intensity. "Vigorous" activity was defined in the NHIS as activities lasting "at least 10 min that cause heavy sweating or large increases in breathing or heart rate". "Light or moderate" activity was defined as those lasting "at least 10 min that cause only light sweating or a slight to moderate increase in breathing or heart rate". Smoking status was defined based on lifetime and current smoking behaviors. All adults were asked if they had smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their entire life. Those who said "yes" were asked a series of questions about the age at which they began smoking and their current smoking practices (every day, some days, not at all). The NHIS defines current smokers as those who have ever smoked 100 cigarettes and currently smoke every day or some days. Those who no longer smoked were categorized as former smokers. We combined the five NHIS categories ("current every day", "current some day", "former", "never", "smoker, current unknown") into three categories representing "never", "former", and "current" smoker. Assessment of participants' alcohol use was similarly ascertained from a series of questions about lifetime and current consumption and categorized as "infrequent", "light", "moderate", and "heavy".

### Childhood injuries and food stamp benefits: an examination of administrative data in one US state [^2836f2c7]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

We begin by estimating the probability of a childhood injury claim as a function of the calendar week for the full sample regardless of SNAP disbursement date. Then, we split the sample of ER claims by the week of SNAP benefit receipt. Results between SNAP receipt and injury-related ER claims in the set of states that disburse SNAP benefits in the first week of the month are proxied in our data by the set of households who receive their SNAP in the first calendar week. Whereas, our results in calendar weeks 2 and 3 provides an indication of how a staggered SNAP disbursement schedule may influence childhood injury-related healthcare utilization patterns.

We test the sensitivity of our main result to two different specifications first explored by Heflin et al. First, we split the sample of ER claims into those with and without any reported earnings to explore the possibility that households without earned income are more responsive to the issuance schedule of SNAP. Households without earnings likely have access to other means-tested social policy programs which disburse benefits at the beginning of the calendar month on a single date, such as TANF, the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), or Supplemental Security Income (SSI). As a consequence, SNAP benefits received in the last half of the month may have a larger affect in reducing childhood injuries by boosting food consumption at a point when other resources may be depleted and helping the family avoid stress that might trigger negative child or parenting behaviors associated with childhood injuries. In contrast, we expect that it is somewhat easier for households with multiple sources of income flowing into the household throughout the month to smooth their food consumption and provide a more supportive environment for children and parenting. According to national data from the US Department of Agriculture, just over half of SNAP households with children had earned income.

Comparisons of participants with a SUD to those without a SUD on the three selected aggregated competitive employment outcomes revealed no significant differences in any outcomes between the two groups within either the TSW or CSM program (p s > 0.1). In TSW, 33/61 (55.1%) of participants with a SUD worked versus 23/38 (60.5%) of those with no SUD, with 22.11 (SD = 28.89) versus 16.98 (SD = 26.60) weeks worked and $3,182.40 (SD = 4,494.73) versus $3,832.38 (SD = 7,993.60) wages earned, respectively. In CSM, 41/62 (66.1%) of participants with a SUD worked versus 25/42 (59.5%) of those with no SUD, with 20.17 (SD = 26.10) versus 25.06 (SD = 30.33) weeks worked and $3,444.54 (SD = 5,689.76) versus $4,395.22 (SD = 5,689.76) wages earned, respectively.

### Use of antenatal corticosteroids at 22 weeks of gestation [^4c831165]. ACOG (2021). High credibility.

Updated recommendation for antenatal corticosteroids by gestational age — administration may be considered at 22 0/7 weeks to 22 6/7 weeks if neonatal resuscitation is planned and after appropriate counseling (2C; weak recommendation, low-quality evidence), whereas at 20 0/7 weeks to 21 6/7 weeks it is not recommended due to absence of data to suggest benefit; table labels are: 20 0/7 weeks to 21 6/7 weeks — Not recommended 1A; 22 0/7 weeks to 22 6/7 weeks — Consider 2C; 23 0/7 weeks to 23 6/7 weeks — Consider 2B; 24 0/7 weeks to 24 6/7 weeks — Recommended 1B; 25 0/7 weeks to 25 6/7 weeks — Recommended 1B.

### Children with special health care needs and forgone family employment [^5e38e6a5]. Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Family income is known to affect child health, but this relationship can be bidirectional. We sought to characterize this relationship by quantifying forgone family employment (FFE) due to a child's health condition in families of children with special health care needs (CSHCN) with updated figures.

Methods

We conducted a secondary data analysis from the 2016–2017 National Survey of Children's Health. CSHCN with previously employed caregivers were included (N = 14050). FFE was defined as any family member having stopped work and/or reduced hours because of their child's health or health condition. Child, caregiver, and household characteristics were compared by FFE status. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to evaluate the association between hours of medical care provide by a family member and FFE. US Bureau of Labor Statistics reports were used to estimate lost earnings from FFE.

Results

FFE occurred in 14.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] 12.9%-16.1%) of previously employed families with CSHCN and was 40.9% (95% CI 27.1%-54.7%) for children with an intellectual disability. We observed disproportionately high FFE among CSHCN who were 0 to 5 years old and of Hispanic ethnicity. We found a strong association between FFE and increasing hours of family-provided medical care, with an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of 1.72 (95% CI 1.25–2.36) for < 1 hour per week (compared with 0 hours), an aOR of 5.96 (95% CI 4.30–8.27) for 1 to 4 hours per week, an aOR of 11.89 (95% CI 6.19–22.81) for 5 to 10 hours per week, and an aOR of 8.89 (95% CI 5.26–15.01) for > 10 hours per week. Lost earnings for each household with FFE were estimated at ∼$18000 per year.

Conclusions

With our findings, we highlight the need to implement programs and policies that address forgone income experienced by families of CSHCN.

Fig. 3
Estimated size of target population for the COVID-19 vaccination program by population group. a Number of individuals. b Proportion. Note that the overlaps between groups were excluded

Given 10 million doses administered per day, and a two-dose vaccination schedule, it will likely take about 7 months to vaccinate 70% of the overall population. However, only 1 week would be required to vaccinate individuals working in critical infrastructure sectors (Tier 1 and 2), three weeks for Tier 3, two months for Tier 4, about 2 months for Tier 5, and 1 month for Tier 6 (Fig. 4, and Additional file 1: Fig. S1). With an expected 0.61 billion doses produced this year, and given a fixed 70% uptake rate among tiers, the estimated vaccine supply could cover individuals in Tiers 1–3 and half of individuals in Tier 4 given a two-dose vaccination schedule.

Fig. 4
Days needed to vaccinate 70% of the target population, stratified by vaccination tier, under the assumption that 10 million doses are administered per day. Note that values reported within the square (e.g. 182.5 m) denote 70% of the population size in each tier; m denotes million

Sensitivity analyses show it will take 8 months to vaccinate 90% of individuals given 10 million doses administered each day; 1.8 years to vaccinate 70% of individuals given 3 million doses administered each day; 2.3 years to vaccinate 90% of individuals given 3 million doses administered each day (Additional file 1: Figs. S3-S5). It will take around 4 months to vaccinate 90% and 70% of individuals respectively, if the capacity of COVID-19 vaccination delivery was scaled up to 20 million doses administered each day (Additional file 1: Figs. S6-S7).

### Society of Family Planning clinical recommendation: medication abortion between 14 0 / 7 and 27 6 / 7 weeks of gestation: jointly developed with the Society for Maternal-fetal Medicine [^31666c80]. Contraception (2024). High credibility.

Effect of gestational duration on medication abortion regimens — Mifepristone in addition to misoprostol results in faster time to complete abortion in all gestational duration ranges, and in one study mifepristone's effect on time to abortion was similar for pregnancies < 20 weeks of gestation vs 20 weeks of gestation or more; that study used misoprostol 600 mcg vaginally, then 400 mcg sublingually every 3 hours, with the combined regimen adding mifepristone 200 mg 24 hours before the first misoprostol dose.

### Workplace productivity loss and indirect costs associated with preterm birth in the United States [^a817959d]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). Medium credibility.

Prespecified data fields in the database were used for all baseline sociodemographic and employment covariates. Diagnostic and procedural medical billing codes were used for sample selection, cohort identification, and all other covariates. The codes used are reported in Appendix 2, available online at. Missing or uninterpretable values for continuous covariates were classified as missing. Preexisting categories in the databases were used for categorical covariates; data fields of "unknown" or "unknown or other" were analyzed according to their classification rather than as "missing".

Outcomes were examined in the year after the index date and as the number of days and costs for medical-related absenteeism, workplace absenteeism, disability, and aggregate workplace productivity loss. Indirect costs were estimated as full days (8 hours) or half-days (4 hours) multiplied by the current average hourly wage rate ($31.38) for all occupations, as reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Costs were inflated to December 2021 U.S. dollars using the medical care component of the Consumer Price Index. Medical-related absenteeism was defined as the number of unique days with an emergency or inpatient visit and half-days for outpatient visits. – Workplace absenteeism was defined as number of days with sick leave, leave (which included, per employer reporting, bereavement, military leave, jury duty, and other types of absence), recreational leave, and Family and Medical Leave Act leave. An alternative definition of workplace absenteeism that only included sick leave and Family and Medical Leave Act leave was examined in sensitivity analyses. Disability was defined as number of days with a short-term or long-term disability claim. Indirect costs were estimated as hours multiplied by 60% of the Bureau of Labor Statistics hourly wage rate ($31.38).

### A qualitative study describing experiences of pregnancy discrimination in the workplace [^6e03d97b]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Qualitatively assess experiences of occupational pregnancy discrimination.

Methods

A fully remote phenomenological qualitative study was completed leveraging semistructured interviews with a sample of pregnant employees in the United States. Inclusion criteria included being pregnant, working at least 35 hours per week, employed at least 1 year at current employer, and without diagnosed depression/anxiety.

Results

Participants (N = 20) were, on average, 30 years of age, worked 42.6 hours per week, self-identified as non-Hispanic black (50%), and earned least a bachelor's degree (85%). Individuals successfully identified various forms of pregnancy discrimination, believing it occurred due to systemic issues or perceptions that women are weak. Most did not report experiences of discrimination fearing retaliation or being unaware of workplace protections.

Conclusion

Pregnancy discrimination in the workplaces comes in various forms and is an issue for some working pregnant individuals.

### Resident satisfaction with radiation oncology training [^54f5d3c2]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

Results

Overall, 232 residents responded to the survey, and 215 completed the residency program portion of the questionnaire and were analyzed, representing 29.3% of all RO residents nationwide in 2016. The survey results are shown in Table 1.

Table 1
Survey responses related to residency program work environment and resident demographics

Education

When asked whether residency allowed for an adequate balance between work and personal life, most residents (75.6%) agreed or strongly agreed. The majority (69.7%) felt that they would choose the same RO residency program again. Approximately three-quarters of residents (73.0%) felt that the faculty and staff cared about the educational success of residents, and more than half (57.7%) felt that their program used resident feedback constructively.

On-call duty

Residents most commonly reported having either 4 to 6 weeks (41.9%) or 7 to 9 weeks (39.5%) of call. During an average week of call, 43.3% of residents reported seeing 2 to 3 consults outside of their normal clinical responsibilities. Two-thirds reported for work at least 1 weekend day during a call week (69.7%). When residents were asked how many hours were spent at work in an average week, 1.9% reported ≤ 40 hours, 20.9% worked 41 to 50 hours, 47.9% worked 51 to 60 hours, 20.9% responded 61 to 70 hours, and 8.4% reported working ≥ 70 hours.

Demographics and debt

When asked about educational debt, 13% of residents reported an educational debt of ≥ $300,000, 21.9% reported a debt of $200,000 to $299,999, 13.5% reported a debt of 100,000 to $199,999, 9.3% reported a debt of $50,000 of $99,999, and 41.9% reported < $50,000 of debt. Nearly one-third of respondents (32.1%) were women. Approximately half of all respondents (54.9%) were married (59.0% and 46.3% of men and women were married, respectively).

### Schedules for home visits in the early postpartum period [^59f6ac96]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Maternal complications, including psychological/mental health problems and neonatal morbidity, have commonly been observed in the postpartum period. Home visits by health professionals or lay supporters in the weeks following birth may prevent health problems from becoming chronic, with long-term effects. This is an update of a review last published in 2017.

Objectives

The primary objective of this review is to assess the effects of different home-visiting schedules on maternal and newborn mortality during the early postpartum period. The review focuses on the frequency of home visits (how many home visits in total), the timing (when visits started, e.g. within 48 hours of the birth), duration (when visits ended), intensity (how many visits per week), and different types of home-visiting interventions.

Search Methods

For this update, we searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (19 May 2021), and checked reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (including cluster-, quasi-RCTs and studies available only as abstracts) comparing different home-visiting interventions that enrolled participants in the early postpartum period (up to 42 days after birth) were eligible for inclusion. We excluded studies in which women were enrolled and received an intervention during the antenatal period (even if the intervention continued into the postnatal period), and studies recruiting only women from specific high-risk groups (e.g. women with alcohol or drug problems).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence.

Main Results

We included 16 randomised trials with data for 12,080 women. The trials were carried out in countries across the world, in both high- and low-resource settings. In low-resource settings, women receiving usual care may have received no additional postnatal care after early hospital discharge. The interventions and controls varied considerably across studies. Trials focused on three broad types of comparisons, as detailed below. In all but four of the included studies, postnatal care at home was delivered by healthcare professionals. The aim of all interventions was broadly to assess the well-being of mothers and babies, and to provide education and support. However, some interventions had more specific aims, such as to encourage breastfeeding, or to provide practical support. For most of our outcomes, only one or two studies provided data, and results were inconsistent overall. All studies had several domains with high or unclear risk of bias. More versus fewer home visits (five studies, 2102 women) The evidence is very uncertain about whether home visits have any effect on maternal and neonatal mortality (very low-certainty evidence). Mean postnatal depression scores as measured with the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) may be slightly higher (worse) with more home visits, though the difference in scores was not clinically meaningful (mean difference (MD) 1.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.25 to 1.79; two studies, 767 women; low-certainty evidence). Two separate analyses indicated conflicting results for maternal satisfaction (both low-certainty evidence); one indicated that there may be benefit with fewer visits, though the 95% CI just crossed the line of no effect (risk ratio (RR) 0.96, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.02; two studies, 862 women). However, in another study, the additional support provided by health visitors was associated with increased mean satisfaction scores (MD 14.70, 95% CI 8.43 to 20.97; one study, 280 women; low-certainty evidence). Infant healthcare utilisation may be decreased with more home visits (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.64; four studies, 1365 infants) and exclusive breastfeeding at six weeks may be increased (RR 1.17, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.36; three studies, 960 women; low-certainty evidence). Serious neonatal morbidity up to six months was not reported in any trial. Different models of postnatal care (three studies, 4394 women) In a cluster-RCT comparing usual care with individualised care by midwives, extended up to three months after the birth, there may be little or no difference in neonatal mortality (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.12; one study, 696 infants). The proportion of women with EPDS scores ≥ 13 at four months is probably reduced with individualised care (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.86; one study, 1295 women). One study suggests there may be little to no difference between home visits and telephone screening in neonatal morbidity up to 28 days (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.12; one study, 696 women). In a different study, there was no difference between breastfeeding promotion and routine visits in exclusive breastfeeding rates at six months (RR 1.47, 95% CI 0.81 to 2.69; one study, 656 women). Home versus facility-based postnatal care (eight studies, 5179 women) The evidence suggests there may be little to no difference in postnatal depression rates at 42 days postpartum and also as measured on an EPDS scale at 60 days. Maternal satisfaction with postnatal care may be better with home visits (RR 1.36, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.62; three studies, 2368 women). There may be little to no difference in infant emergency health care visits or infant hospital readmissions (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.38; three studies, 3257 women) or in exclusive breastfeeding at two weeks (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.18; 1 study, 513 women).

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of home visits on maternal and neonatal mortality. Individualised care as part of a package of home visits probably improves depression scores at four months and increasing the frequency of home visits may improve exclusive breastfeeding rates and infant healthcare utilisation. Maternal satisfaction may also be better with home visits compared to hospital check-ups. Overall, the certainty of evidence was found to be low and findings were not consistent among studies and comparisons. Further well designed RCTs evaluating this complex intervention will be required to formulate the optimal package.

### Characteristics of low-wage workers and their labor market… [^d7801ae9]. aspe.hhs.gov (2004). Low credibility.

How much do they earn per hour and per week. What are their usual hours worked per week. In which occupations and industries are they concentrated. To what extent are health insurance benefits available on their jobs. How do their job characteristics differ from those of higher-wage workers. Do the answers to these questions differ across key subgroups of the low-wage population. hourly wages are below a cutoff value. Some researchers have defined the cutoff value as the hourly wage at which a full-time worker would have annual earnings below the poverty level for a family of three or four. The wage cutoff value has also been defined as the minimum wage.

Some researchers have defined low-wage workers as those whose annual earnings are below a cutoff value* to account both for hourly wages that workers receive and for the amount that they work. Mishel et al. define low-wage workers as those who worked full- or part-time involuntarily, but whose annual earnings were not high enough to reach the poverty level for a family of three, which was $15, 208 in 1998. Similarly, Carnevale and Rose use an annual earnings cutoff value of $15, 000 a year, and Holzer et al. use a cutoff value of $12, 000 a year for three consecutive years. Another approach used in the literature is to define low-wage workers as those whose. Census Bureau definition) and if he or she worked or looked for work in at least 27 weeks over the past calendar year. Similarly, Acs et al.

consider a family to be poor if its total annual income was below twice the federal poverty level and as working if all adult family members worked an average of half-time or more during the year. Why are estimates of the size of the low-income working population much lower in studies that use total family income to define low-wage workers than in those that do not. The explanation is that a significant number of low-wage workers are in families with total incomes.

### Consensus statement of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine on the recommended amount of sleep for healthy children: methodology and discussion [^8e3befe1]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Sleep Medicine consensus — age-based sleep duration for optimal health specifies that infants 4 months to 12 months should sleep 12 to 16 hours per 24 hours (including naps) on a regular basis to promote optimal health. Children 1 to 2 years of age should sleep 11 to 14 hours per 24 hours (including naps) on a regular basis to promote optimal health. Children 3 to 5 years of age should sleep 10 to 13 hours per 24 hours (including naps) on a regular basis to promote optimal health. Children 6 to 12 years of age should sleep 9 to 12 hours per 24 hours to promote optimal health. Teenagers 13 to 18 years of age should sleep 8 to 10 hours per 24 hours on a regular basis to promote optimal health.

### Measuring impact of a quality improvement initiative on glaucoma clinic flow using an automated real-time locating system [^d6078582]. BMC Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Lean strategy guided quality improvement initiatives can improve efficiency and flow in ophthalmology clinics. For example, in other studies that have used lean methodology: (1) a vitreoretinal clinic moved Optical Coherence Tomography machines from central photography suites to individual examination rooms and saw a 36 and 74% decrease in total visit and wait times respectively, and (2) an outpatient retina clinic achieved an 18% faster patient flow time by placing patients into one of five pre-identified common clinic flow paths, adjusting staffing, and optimizing scheduling around derived predictors of patient flow times.

Without an accurate, automated, and inexpensive RTLS system, measuring the impact of lean strategy guided policy changes on clinic flow would have been laborious and costly. The RTLS was able to collect data of 1972 visits from 1589 patients over a 6-month period at a capital cost of $31,728 and an estimated recurring expense of $318 for supplies. In comparison, the capital costs for direct observation methods would have been approximately $20 per observer. However, assuming clinic hours of 7 am to 7 pm for a 5-day week, conducting direct observation over 6 months would have required 1440 hours of manpower (60 hours/ week × 4 weeks/ month × 6 months = 1440 hours). At the University of Michigan's minimum wage for employees (plus 40% fringe benefits) the cost of employing one person to conduct the study would have been $29,400 (1400 hours × $15/ hour × 140% = $29,400). Given that the RTLS was able to capture process and wait times for 23 different clinical spaces, we estimate that we would need a minimum of 6 full time observers placed strategically throughout the clinic to collect data at this level of granularity, with a resultant total study cost of at least $176,000.

### Hours based scheduling in neonatology: a practical approach [^e685fcc7]. Journal of Perinatology (2025). Medium credibility.

No standard work assignment exists for practicing neonatologists in the United States. Unlike other types of care providers in the neonatal intensive care unit who work under standard shift or work hour expectations, attending neonatologist staffing models vary significantly by job task, shift length, in-person or remote coverage responsibility, ambulatory or inpatient practice, and total clinical versus non-clinical commitments among other variables. Due to the diversity of clinical and non-clinical responsibilities of practicing neonatologists, transparent and equitable staffing models can be challenging to design and execute. We present a flexible approach to neonatologist scheduling that has been implemented effectively at two academic medical centers with multiple sites and types of neonatology clinical practice. This model allows for clear delineation of time dedicated to a variety of clinical and non-clinical activities to allow both clinical and administrative leadership clarity on the full range of professional responsibilities of a practicing neonatologist.

### Dose of early intervention treatment during children's first 36 months of life is associated with developmental outcomes: an observational cohort study in three low / low-middle income countries [^5be22cdf]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Description of developmental outcomes and treatment dose

The sample had an unadjusted mean (SD) MDI = 101.2 (10.4) and PDI = 106.8 (14.1) at 36-months. Average home visits dose was 91.4% over 36 months, when 8,990 visits out of 9,841 were completed on schedule every two weeks, and 95% of the participants achieved 80% or greater home visits dose. The most common reason for a missed visit was the inability to locate the mother and child at home at the scheduled time (40.3%), for example because the family was travelling away from the home or had moved temporarily. However, the second most common reason was those related to the parent trainer, such as being ill or having a conflict with another meeting (23.9%). Child or mother unavailable for other reasons (15.3%), for example because the mother was working or baby was sleeping, and weather (10.0%) were the only other reasons accounting for at least 10% of the missed visits. Mother or family directly refusing the home visit at the scheduled time was rare (2.5%).

Mothers reported engaging the child in the assigned activities on an average of 62.5% of days throughout the 36 month period. This protocol implementation dose equates to practicing the intervention activities 4.4 days per week or 674 days over the 36 month trial period. Home visits dose was modestly correlated with protocol implementation dose (r = 0.35). Parent trainers estimated at the end of the trial that 66.2% of families practiced the intervention "always" or "almost always" throughout the 36 months.

### Marriage, children, and sex-based differences in physician hours and income [^a6e6d0bd]. JAMA Health Forum (2023). High credibility.

The sample of physicians was stratified into 3 categories to assess the association of marriage and children with the earnings gap: single without children (n = 11 725), married without children (n = 29 030), and with children (n = 54 680). A physician was classified as single if they reported never being married or as widowed, divorced, or separated. A physician was classified as with children if they had 1 or more children living in their household, regardless of marital status. Because the ACS does not identify children not living in the household, older physicians whose children have left the household were classified as without children.

Hours worked were measured as the respondent's reported usual weekly hours worked. Hourly wages were calculated as annual earnings divided by usual weekly hours times 50 weeks.

Earnings for each physician were calculated as the sum of self-reported wage and salary income plus business income during the previous year. For privacy reasons, income for the top 1% of earners in each state was recoded by the US Census Bureau as the average value for all individuals in the top 1% of earnings. This adjustment has been found to have little effect on estimates of physician earnings. Because comparisons of ACS estimates of income with estimates from tax records suggest that physicians may underreport business income in the ACS, our estimates do not account for sex disparities in unreported business income. This study was deemed exempt from institutional review board or ethics committee review because the data used were from a public-use government-administered survey. The study followed the Strengthening of Reporting Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline.

### Marriage, children, and sex-based differences in physician hours and income [^e6a846e3]. JAMA Health Forum (2023). High credibility.

Importance

A better understanding of the association between family structure and sex gaps in physician earnings and hours worked over the life cycle is needed to advance policies addressing persistent sex disparities.

Objective

To investigate differences in earnings and hours worked for male and female physicians at various ages and family status.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This retrospective, cross-sectional study used data on physicians aged 25 to 64 years responding to the American Community Survey between 2005 and 2019.

Exposures

Earned income and work hours.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Outcomes included annual earned income, usual hours worked per week, and earnings per hour worked. Gaps in earnings and hours by sex were calculated by family status and physician age and, in some analyses, adjusted for demographic characteristics and year of survey. Data analyses were conducted between 2019 and 2022.

Results

The sample included 95 435 physicians (35.8% female, 64.2% male, 19.8% Asian, 4.8% Black, 5.9% Hispanic, 67.3% White, and 2.2% other race or ethnicity) with a mean (SD) age of 44.4 (10.4) years. Relative to male physicians, female physicians were more likely to be single (18.8% vs 11.2%) and less likely to have children (53.3% vs 58.2%). Male-female earnings gaps grew with age and, when accumulated from age 25 to 64 years, were approximately $1.6 million for single physicians, $2.5 million for married physicians without children, and $3.1 million for physicians with children. Gaps in earnings per hour did not vary by family structure, with male physicians earning between 21.4% and 23.9% more per hour than female physicians. The male-female gap in hours worked was 0.6% for single physicians, 7.0% for married physicians without children, and 17.5% for physicians with children.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cross-sectional study of US physicians, marriage and children were associated with a greater earnings penalty for female physicians, primarily due to fewer hours worked relative to men. Addressing the barriers that lead to women working fewer hours could contribute to a reduction in the male-female earnings gap while helping to expand the effective physician workforce.

### Personal care aides as household employees and independent contractors: estimating the size and job characteristics of the workforce [^a7af4e7c]. Innovation in Aging (2022). Medium credibility.

PCAs' job characteristics are measured with full-time year-round work status and annual earnings. Full-time and year-round work refers to working 35 hours or more per week and 50 weeks or more year-round. Annual earnings refer to annual gross earnings adjusted to the year 2019 for inflation. These variables are used as basic job characteristic indicators for PCAs because securing enough work hours and achieving earnings stability are reported to be the primary concerns for many PCAs (, p. 34).

In terms of data analyses, I first estimated the weighted percentages of PCAs working as household employees and independent contractors in all states, the selected three states (California, New York, and Texas), and each of the rest of states other than the three states (referred as "Other" states). I then examined if and how the employment characteristics of household employees and independent contractors differed from those of PCAs in other employment arrangements. Using the most common Fisher's Least Significant Difference pairwise multiple comparisons in SAS GLM procedure (, p. 4004), I examined if the mean earnings of household employees and independent contractors statistically differed from the mean earnings of PCAs in other employment arrangements. Because the distribution of earnings data is generally skewed by outliers, I also conducted two-sample median tests using SAS NPAR1WAY procedures (, p. 6652) to assess whether or not the median earnings of household employees and independent contractors statistically differed from the median earnings of PCAs in other employment arrangements. In addition, using Fisher's Least Significant Difference pairwise multiple comparison tests in SAS GLM procedure, I examined if and how the rates (expressed as percentages here) of full-time year-round working PCAs among household employees and independent contractors differed from the rates (expressed as percentages here) of those in other employment arrangements.

### Does the day of the week predict a cesarean section? A statewide analysis [^5593f8b3]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Although guidelines for clinical indications of cesarean sections (CS) exist, nonclinical factors may affect CS practices. We hypothesize that CS rates vary by day of the week.

Methods

An analysis of the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development database for California from 2006 to 2010 was performed. All patients admitted to a teaching or nonteaching hospital for attempted vaginal delivery were included. Patients who died within 24 h of admission were excluded. Weekend days were defined as Saturday and Sunday, and weekdays were defined as Monday to Friday. The primary outcome was CS versus vaginal delivery. Multivariable analysis was performed, adjusting for patient demographics, clinical factors, and system variables.

Results

A total of 1,855,675 women were included. The overall CS rate was 9.02%. On unadjusted analysis, CS rates were significantly lower on weekends versus weekdays (6.65% versus 9.58%, P < 0.001). On adjusted analysis, women were 27% less likely to have a CS on weekends than on weekdays (odds ratio [OR] 0.73, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.71–0.75, P < 0.001). In addition, Hispanic ethnicity and delivery in teaching hospitals were associated with a decreased likelihood of CS (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.86–0.96, P = 0.01; OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.69–0.93, P < 0.001, respectively).

Conclusions

CS rates are significantly decreased on weekends relative to weekdays, even when controlling for patient, hospital, and system factors.

### Working conditions in women with multiple pregnancy-the impact on preterm birth and adherence to guidelines: a prospective cohort study [^ac503996]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Women with multiple pregnancies are at risk for maternal complications such as preterm birth. Hazardous working conditions, such as physically demanding work and long and irregular working hours, might increase the risk of preterm birth.

Objective

This study primarily aimed to determine whether certain working conditions up to 20 weeks of pregnancy increase the risk of preterm birth in multiple pregnancies. The secondary objective was to evaluate whether the working conditions of Dutch women with multiple pregnancy have been adjusted to the guidelines of the Netherlands Society of Occupational Medicine.

Study Design

We performed a prospective cohort study alongside the ProTWIN trial, a multicenter randomized controlled trial that assessed whether cervical pessaries could effectively prevent preterm birth. Women with paid work of > 8 hours per week completed questionnaires concerning general health and working conditions between 16 and 20 weeks of pregnancy. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify work-related factors associated with preterm birth (32–36 weeks' gestation) and very preterm birth (< 32 weeks' gestation). We analyzed a subgroup of participants who worked for more than half of the week (> 28 hours). We calculated the proportion of women who reported work-related factors not in accordance with guidelines.

Results

We studied 383 women, of whom 168 (44%) had been randomized to pessary, 142 (37%) to care as usual, and 73 (19%) did not participate in the randomized part of the study. After adjusting for confounding variables, working > 28 hours was associated with very preterm birth (n = 33; 78%) (adjusted odds ratio, 3.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.1–8.1), and irregular working times were associated with preterm birth (n = 26, 17%) (adjusted odds ratio, 2.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.0–4.1) and very preterm birth (n = 10; 24%) (adjusted odds ratio, 2.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.0–7.3). Within a subgroup of 213 participants working > 28 hours per week, multivariable analysis showed that irregular working times (n = 16; 20%) (adjusted odds ratio, 3.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.2–10.1) and no/little freedom in performance of tasks (n = 23; 28%) (adjusted odds ratio, 3.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.3–7.3) were associated with preterm birth. Irregular working times (n = 9; 27%) (adjusted odds ratio, 3.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.0–11.1), requiring physical strength (n = 9; 27%) (adjusted odds ratio, 5.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.6–17.8), high physical workload (n = 7; 21%) (adjusted odds ratio, 3.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.1–13.9), and no/little freedom in performing tasks (n = 10; 30%) (adjusted odds ratio, 3.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.1–9.6) were associated with very preterm birth. Before 20 weeks of pregnancy, 224 (58.5%) women with multiple pregnancy continued to work under circumstances that were not in accordance with the guidelines.

Conclusion

In our cohort study, nearly 60% of women with multiple pregnancy continued to work under circumstances not in accordance with the guidelines to avoid physical and job strain and long and irregular working hours. Irregular hours were associated with preterm and very preterm birth, and long hours were associated with preterm birth.

### Changes in physician work hours and patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic [^b3a61553]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Results

Our data set included 8853 observations of 2563 unique physicians (weighted demographic data were 5311 male physicians [60%] and 6230 White physicians [70.4%]; weighted mean [SD] age was 46.7 [13.4] years). In January 2019, mean weekly hours worked per week by physicians was 50.8 (95% CI, 47.7–51.8 hours per week). In March 2020, this began to decrease (49.2 hours per week; 95% CI, 48.0–50.3 hours per week; P = 0.05) and reached the lowest point in May 2020 (47.5 hours per week; 95% CI, 46.1–48.8 hours per week; P < .001) (Figure). Work hours stabilized in the summer before reaching another low in November. Mean weekly work hours in December 2020 were 47.8 (95% CI, 46.6–49.1 hours per week; P < .001), an approximate 6% decrease from January 2019.

### Effect of escalating financial incentive rewards on maintenance of weight loss: a randomized clinical trial [^93c989a0]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Identifying effective strategies for treating obesity is a public health priority.

Objective

To test an escalating lottery-based incentive tied to daily self-weighing for weight loss maintenance.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This 2-phase, 2-arm randomized clinical trial enrolled participants aged 30 to 80 years with an initial body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) of 30.0 to 45.0 who lost at least 5 kg during 4 to 6 months in a national online weight management program. Study investigators and outcomes assessors were blinded to participant groups. Data were collected and analyzed from May 23, 2016, through November 13, 2017, based on intention to treat.

Interventions

All participants were advised to weigh themselves daily, with a goal of 6 or more days per week, and received text messaging feedback on their performance. Incentive group participants were eligible for a lottery-based incentive worth an expected value of $3.98 in week 1 that escalated by $0.43 each week they achieved their self-weighing goal during months 1 to 6 (phase 1), followed by no incentives during months 7 to 12 (phase 2).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was weight change at the end of phase 1. Secondary outcomes included weight change at the end of phase 2 and changes in self-reported physical activity and eating behaviors.

Results

A total of 258 participants (128 in the incentive group and 130 in the control group) had a mean (SD) age of 48.0 (10.5) years and mean (SD) body mass index of 32.1 (3.9); 225 (87.2%) were women; 235 (91.1%) were white; and 102 (39.5%) had an annual income of at least $100 000. Weight measurement was transmitted by 250 participants (96.9%) at 6 months and 227 (88.0%) at 12 months. The percentage of weeks that incentive and control participants achieved a mean self-weighing of at least 6 times was 85.3% vs 75.8%, respectively (P = 0.002) in phase 1 and 37.7% vs 50.2%, respectively (P = 0.009) in phase 2. Mean weight changes at the end of phase 1 were -1.1 (95% CI, -2.1 to -0.1) kg in the incentive group and -1.9 (95% CI, -2.9 to -0.8) kg in the control group, with a mean difference of 0.7 (95% CI, -0.7 to 2.2) kg (P = 0.30 for comparison). At the end of phase 2, mean weight changes were 0.2 (95% CI, -1.2 to 1.7) kg in the incentive group and -0.6 (95% CI, -2.0 to 0.8) kg in the control group, with a mean difference of 0.8 (95% CI, -1.2 to 2.8) kg (P = 0.41 for comparison).

Conclusions and Relevance

Compared with an active control condition of weekly messages, escalating lottery-based incentives transiently increased rates of self-weighing but did not significantly enhance weight loss maintenance.

### Long working hours and change in body weight: analysis of individual-participant data from 19 cohort studies [^036060ae]. International Journal of Obesity (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To examine the relation between long working hours and change in body mass index (BMI).

Methods

We performed random effects meta-analyses using individual-participant data from 19 cohort studies from Europe, US and Australia (n = 122,078), with a mean of 4.4-year follow-up. Working hours were measured at baseline and categorised as part time (< 35h/week), standard weekly hours (35-40h, reference), 41-48h, 49-54h and ≥ 55h/week (long working hours). There were four outcomes at follow-up: (1) overweight/obesity (BMI ≥ 25kg/m 2) or (2) overweight (BMI 25–29.9kg/m 2) among participants without overweight/obesity at baseline; (3) obesity (BMI ≥ 30kg/m 2) among participants with overweight at baseline, and (4) weight loss among participants with obesity at baseline.

Results

Of the 61,143 participants without overweight/obesity at baseline, 20.2% had overweight/obesity at follow-up. Compared with standard weekly working hours, the age-, sex- and socioeconomic status-adjusted relative risk (RR) of overweight/obesity was 0.95 (95% CI 0.90–1.00) for part-time work, 1.07 (1.02–1.12) for 41–48 weekly working hours, 1.09 (1.03–1.16) for 49-54h and 1.17 (1.08–1.27) for long working hours (P for trend < 0.0001). The findings were similar after multivariable adjustment and in subgroup analyses. Long working hours were associated with an excess risk of shift from normal weight to overweight rather than from overweight to obesity. Long working hours were not associated with weight loss among participants with obesity.

Conclusions

This analysis of large individual-participant data suggests a small excess risk of overweight among the healthy-weight people who work long hours.

### Standard terminology for fetal, infant, and perinatal deaths [^2896fa60]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Perinatal death reporting — state criteria and Model Law thresholds — recommended definitions and reporting requirements are issued through the Model State Vital Statistics Act and Regulations (the Model Law), which recommends fetal death reporting for deaths that occur at 350 g birth weight or more or, if the weight is unknown, of 20 completed weeks' gestation or more; however, states have the authority to register these vital events and might not necessarily follow the Model Law, resulting in differing criteria such as gestational age criteria only (All periods; ≥ 16 weeks; ≥ 20 weeks; ≥ 5 months), both gestational age and birth weight criteria (≥ 20 weeks or ≥ 350 g; ≥ 20 weeks or ≥ 500 g; ≥ 20 weeks or ≥ 400 g; ≥ 20 weeks or ≥ 250 g), and birth weight criteria only (≥ 350 g; ≥ 500 g), with footnotes specifying handling of unknown measurements (If gestational age is unknown, weight of ≥ 500 g; If gestational age is unknown, weight of ≥ 400 g, ≥ 15 ounces; If weight is unknown, ≥ 20 weeks' completed gestation).

### Self-reported lifestyle behaviours in families with an increased risk for type 2 diabetes across six European countries: a cross-sectional analysis from the feel4Diabetes-study [^b31623e4]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Sedentary behaviour

Parents' total sitting time on weekdays in parents and screen-time behaviour during the week in children were assessed in respectively the high-risk questionnaire and the EBRB-questionnaire. Total sitting time in parents was assessed using the question: "During the last 7 days, how many hours did you (parent) spend sitting on a weekday?" (ICC = 0.58). Furthermore, children's screen-time behaviour was assessed by the following question: "About how many hours per day does your child usually devote to screen-activities (excluding school)?". This question was asked separately for weekdays and weekend days (ICC = 0.65 and 0.69). Answer options were 0 h/d, < 0.5 h/d, 0.5 h/d to < 1 h/d, 1 h/d to < 2 h/d, 2 h/d to < 3 h/d, 3 h/d to < 4 h/d, 4 h/d to < 5 h/d, 5 h/d to < 6 h/d, 6 h/d to < 7 h/d, 7 h/d to > 7 h/d. Afterwards, these categorical values were recoded into numerical values according to the midpoint method (e.g. 0 h/d was recoded into 0 min/day; < 0.5 h/d was recoded into 15 min per day; 2 h/d to < 3 h/d was recoded into 150 min/day; > 7 h/d was recoded into 450 min/day) and the time spend on screen-time activities on weekdays and weekend days were calculated into a mean score using the following formula: (weekdays*5) + (weekend days*2)/7. To determine the percentage of children meeting the recommendation of less than two hours of recreational screen-time per day (based on current WHO guidelines), the total time spend on screen-time activities were dichotomized into not meeting the guideline (≥ 120 min of screen-time activities per day) and meeting the guideline (< 120 min of screen-time activities per day).
