## Question

53 yr old male: US rt groin shows fat containing right groin hernia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about a 53-year-old man with a fat-containing right inguinal hernia identified on ultrasound, including how to confirm the diagnosis, assess risk, interpret imaging findings, plan surgical management, and determine appropriate follow-up. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about verifying the diagnosis and classifying the hernia type. Then, I should assess risk of complications and the implications of fat-only content. Next, I will review imaging accuracy and when cross-sectional imaging is warranted. After that, I need to decide on management strategy, including watchful waiting versus repair, and choose the operative approach. Finally, I will plan preoperative workup, anticipate special intraoperative considerations, and outline postoperative care and follow-up, ensuring each step is supported by guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and classification. A fat-containing inguinal hernia on ultrasound typically reflects preperitoneal fat herniating through the inguinal canal, most often consistent with an indirect inguinal hernia given the patient's sex and age, and the lateral location relative to the inferior epigastric vessels, although ultrasound alone has limited accuracy for precise type classification compared with operative findings, so I should be cautious about overcalling direct versus indirect on imaging alone [^115Atujd] [^1167BA8b]. Wait, let me verify the terminology update: the HerniaSurge 2023 guidance discourages the term "incarcerated" and instead uses "acutely irreducible", "chronically irreducible", or "strangulated", which I should apply consistently in documentation and counseling [^113GAjJq] [^117CKBzc].

> Next, I should review the clinical significance of fat-only content. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — fat-only hernias can still be symptomatic due to preperitoneal fat entrapment or compression of adjacent structures, and they carry a nonzero risk of progression or complications, so I need to correlate with symptoms and exam rather than dismiss them as benign by content alone [^1145HQN2]. I should double-check for any history of intermittent bulge, pain with exertion, or inability to reduce the mass, because these features would push me toward repair even in the absence of bowel involvement [^111VmaKa].

> I will now examine risk stratification and complications. The main risks include acute irreducibility, strangulation, and chronic pain or disability; however, fat-only hernias generally have a lower immediate risk of strangulation than bowel-containing hernias, though the risk is never zero and increases with size, duration, and patient factors such as obesity or chronic cough [^notfound]. I need to ensure I screen for obstructive urinary symptoms or hematuria because rare sliding hernias can include retroperitoneal structures like the ureter, which changes surgical planning and risk mitigation strategies [^113qm6QZ] [^115uwowJ].

> Let me consider imaging accuracy and next steps. Ultrasound is first-line for groin hernia evaluation, but its positive predictive value varies and is operator dependent, with pooled PPV around 85–90% in surgical cohorts; false positives occur, particularly in obese patients or when no palpable bulge is present, so I should confirm concordance with clinical findings before committing to surgery [^115gFHqz] [^112xcnCo]. Hold on, I should verify whether cross-sectional imaging is indicated here: if the exam is equivocal, if the hernia is large or atypical, if there is concern for occult contralateral disease, or if there are urinary symptoms suggesting ureteral involvement, CT or MRI can improve anatomic definition and preoperative planning; ACR Appropriateness Criteria support ultrasound, CT, or MRI as acceptable initial modalities depending on context, with CT often preferred when complications or alternative pathology are suspected [^117FMeqv] [^115BLbep]. But wait, what if this is an occult hernia with pain and minimal exam findings? MRI has higher sensitivity and specificity than ultrasound or CT for occult hernias and should be considered when clinical suspicion remains high despite negative or nondiagnostic ultrasound [^116UAZMN] [^113j2uSs].

> Now, I need to decide on management. Watchful waiting is reasonable for asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic men with inguinal hernia, provided they understand the risks and have reliable follow-up. However, if the patient is symptomatic, has a bothersome bulge, or any concern for complications, elective repair is indicated [^111VmaKa] [^114R1JuK]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "fat-only equals no urgency", but I should correct that: symptoms and patient preference drive timing, and even fat-only hernias can progress or cause pain, so shared decision-making is key rather than a blanket delay [^1145HQN2] [^111VmaKa].

> Choosing the operative approach requires balancing patient factors and local expertise. Laparoscopic repair, particularly TEP, offers less postoperative pain, faster recovery, and lower recurrence in many series, and it facilitates contralateral groin inspection and repair if a defect is found intraoperatively; open Lichtenstein remains an excellent alternative, especially for large scrotal hernias or when laparoscopy is contraindicated [^111VmaKa] [^114y5P4x]. I should confirm that the patient has no prior lower abdominal surgery or severe cardiopulmonary comorbidity that would preclude pneumoperitoneum before favoring laparoscopy, and I should discuss the trade-offs in recovery and potential complications transparently [^notfound].

> Preoperative workup should be targeted. I need to check for urinary symptoms and, if present, consider CT urography to exclude ureteral involvement, because unrecognized ureteral herniation risks iatrogenic injury during dissection. Preoperative ureteral stenting can aid identification and protection in complex sliding hernias with abundant fat or distorted anatomy [^113qm6QZ] [^115uwowJ]. Let me verify that I also plan to assess the contralateral side intraoperatively during TEP or TAPP, and ensure consent includes possible bilateral repair if a contralateral defect is identified, consistent with HerniaSurge guidance [^114y5P4x].

> Intraoperatively, I should anticipate and protect the cord structures and remain vigilant for atypical fat that might represent retroperitoneal tissue or even ureter. Hold on, I should verify that the hernia sac and contents are fully reduced, and if a large fat mass appears irreducible or unusually broad-based, I must consider ureteral involvement and avoid blind traction; using gentle dissection, identifying anatomic planes, and, when in doubt, obtaining intraoperative imaging or urology consultation can prevent injury [^113qm6QZ] [^115uwowJ]. If I chose an open approach and encounter extensive fat without a clear peritoneal sac, I should pause and reassess for sliding components or retroperitoneal structures before excising tissue [^113qm6QZ].

> Postoperative care should emphasize early ambulation, analgesia, and return to activities within comfort, with counseling on expected seroma or ecchymosis and warning signs of infection or recurrence. I should double-check that mesh-related complications are uncommon but possible, and that chronic postoperative pain affects a minority; preoperative education and expectation management reduce long-term dissatisfaction and help distinguish normal healing from complications [^113629ei] [^114R1JuK]. If persistent bulge or pain occurs, targeted ultrasound can evaluate for seroma, hematoma, or recurrence, guiding conservative versus interventional management [^114xhq3Z].

> Follow-up should be structured to detect recurrence or persistent symptoms. Let me reconsider the timeline: a 2–6 week check-in to assess wound healing and functional recovery, then annual inquiry about bulge, pain, or urinary symptoms thereafter is reasonable; recurrence risk with modern tension-free mesh repairs is low but not negligible, and patients should be counseled accordingly [^notfound]. I should confirm that any new bulge or atypical pain warrants prompt clinical evaluation and, if needed, imaging to distinguish recurrence from alternative diagnoses such as seroma, nerve entrapment, or other groin pathology [^114xhq3Z].

> Special considerations deserve explicit mention. I need to ensure I have screened for lower urinary tract symptoms and communicated the rare possibility of ureteral involvement preoperatively, as missing this can lead to serious morbidity. Documenting that preoperative imaging was reviewed and that ureteral anatomy was considered intraoperatively mitigates medicolegal and clinical risk [^113qm6QZ] [^115uwowJ]. If the patient presents emergently with an acutely irreducible hernia, I should confirm that diagnostic laparoscopy is an appropriate option when expertise and stability allow, per contemporary emergency hernia guidance, and that cross-sectional imaging is prioritized when strangulation is suspected to guide timely operative planning [^116o2EYU] [^117NRyP4].

> In summary, for a 53-year-old man with a fat-containing right inguinal hernia, I should confirm the diagnosis with careful clinical correlation, use ultrasound as first-line imaging but escalate to CT or MRI if exam is equivocal, symptoms are atypical, or there is concern for complications or ureteral involvement. I should manage symptomatic patients with elective repair, favoring laparoscopic TEP when feasible, plan for contralateral inspection, and maintain a high index of suspicion for sliding components intraoperatively, all while employing shared decision-making and structured follow-up to optimize outcomes and safety [^117FMeqv] [^111VmaKa] [^114y5P4x] [^113qm6QZ] [^114R1JuK].

A fat-containing right groin hernia in a 53-year-old male is most likely a **lipoma of the cord** [^111Kggiz] or a **preperitoneal fat herniation** through the inguinal canal, typically indirect and reducible [^111VmaKa]. Ultrasound is the **first-line imaging** [^117FMeqv] to confirm the diagnosis, assess reducibility, and exclude bowel or other contents [^115fi1qS]; if ultrasound is inconclusive or complications are suspected, CT or MRI is indicated [^116EASse]. Asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients may be managed with watchful waiting [^111VmaKa], but persistent symptoms or cosmetic concerns warrant elective repair [^111VmaKa]. Laparoscopic repair offers **faster recovery and less pain** [^111VmaKa], whereas open repair remains appropriate in selected cases; the risk of strangulation is low but present, so patient education and follow-up are essential [^notfound].

---

## Clinical significance and implications

- **Commonality**: Fat-containing hernias are common in adults, often representing a lipoma of the cord or preperitoneal fat herniation [^notfound].

- **Symptoms**: Typically asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic, presenting as a painless or mildly uncomfortable groin bulge [^111VmaKa].

- **Complications**: Risk of incarceration or strangulation is lower than with bowel-containing hernias but still present, necessitating patient education and follow-up [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic imaging modalities and accuracy

| **Imaging modality** | **Accuracy** | **Clinical utility** |
|-|-|-|
| Ultrasound (US) | High sensitivity and specificity for fat-containing hernias [^notfound] | First-line; assesses reducibility, contents, and relationship to spermatic cord [^116EASse] |
| Computed tomography (CT) | Excellent for detailed anatomy and surgical planning [^111Kggiz] | Use if ultrasound is inconclusive or complications suspected [^116EASse] |
| Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) | High soft-tissue resolution [^notfound] | Useful for occult hernias or complex cases [^111VmaKa] |

---

Ultrasound is the **preferred initial modality** because of its high accuracy, dynamic assessment, and avoidance of radiation [^116EASse]. CT or MRI is reserved for inconclusive cases or when complications are suspected [^116EASse].

---

## Management strategies

- **Watchful waiting**: Appropriate for asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients with low risk of complications [^111VmaKa].

- **Surgical repair**: Indicated for symptomatic patients, those with cosmetic concerns, or when the hernia is enlarging or irreducible [^notfound].

- **Surgical techniques**: Laparoscopic repair (TEP or TAPP) offers faster recovery, less pain, and lower recurrence rates compared to open repair; open Lichtenstein repair remains a valid option [^111VmaKa].

---

## Potential complications and risks

- **Incarceration**: Trapping of hernia contents, requiring urgent intervention [^111d3DtM].

- **Strangulation**: Compromise of blood supply to herniated fat, necessitating emergency surgery [^111d3DtM].

- **Recurrence**: Lower with tension-free mesh repairs but still possible [^114R1JuK].

- **Chronic pain**: Persistent postoperative pain occurs in a minority of patients [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis and recurrence rates

Prognosis is **excellent** with appropriate management; recurrence is low with modern tension-free mesh repairs, and patient satisfaction is high [^notfound]. Recurrence rates are approximately 1–3% with mesh repairs and higher with non-mesh techniques.

---

## Follow-up and monitoring recommendations

Regular follow-up is advised to monitor for recurrence or complications, with **annual clinical review** for asymptomatic patients and periodic imaging if symptoms recur or new symptoms develop [^notfound]. Patients should be educated to seek immediate care for acute pain, redness, or a nonreducible bulge.

---

A fat-containing right groin hernia in a 53-year-old male is **typically benign but may require surgical repair** if symptomatic or enlarging. Ultrasound is the **first-line diagnostic tool**, with CT or MRI reserved for complex cases. Management is individualized, balancing watchful waiting against elective repair, with laparoscopic techniques offering favorable outcomes.

### Hydroceles-not just for men [^114TFQVL]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Hydroceles develop in females through the canal of Nuck. This canal is formed when the processes vaginalis fails to obliterate during development. The canal of Nuck can lead to the formation of not only hydroceles, but hernias as well. Although physicians typically think of hydroceles occurring in males, on rare occasions, they do occur in females because of this defect. They are often mistaken for incarcerated hernias, making ultrasound an excellent tool to distinguish between them and guide further treatment.

Case Report

We report a rare case of a 46-year-old female with the chief complaint of a painful groin mass. A diagnosis of a hydrocele was made by point of care ultrasonography in the emergency department after being misdiagnosed by computed tomography scan on two previous occasions. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Point of care ultrasound (POCUS) is a valuable tool for emergency physicians and can lead to quick diagnoses and appropriate management of the patient. Using ultrasound in conjunction with other imaging modalities can improve diagnostic accuracy. POCUS is portable and a powerful tool for immediate answers, and continues to prove its utility for clinical decision making.

Investigations

Ultrasound imaging of the abdomen and pelvis was performed at another facility prior to presenting to our outpatient clinic, which revealed a fat-containing left indirect inguinal hernia extending into the left scrotal sac. No hernia was appreciated in the right groin, nor was a primary malignancy identified. The physical examination findings, as well as imaging, were consistent with a left-sided incarcerated inguinal hernia.

Preoperative laboratory investigations included full blood count (FBC), creatinine and glomerular filtration rate (GFR). All of the mentioned tests were within normal range.

### Waist circumference is not superior to body mass index in predicting groin hernia repair in either men or women [^112mQi9L]. World Journal of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Body mass index (BMI) is by far the most commonly used indicator of body constitution. However, BMI does not account for body fat distribution. An easier method for use in large population-based cohorts is to measure the waist circumference (WC), which is known to correlate with the amount of abdominal visceral fat. The distribution of body fat around the waist is a known risk factor for cardiovascular disease making these patients riskier in major surgery.

A high BMI increases the risk of developing all types of ventral abdominal wall hernias but decreases the risk of developing groin hernias. The reason for this somewhat unexpected difference is unclear. Hypotheses include missed diagnoses and unwillingness from providers to diagnose and repair obese patients due to increased risk for complications. To the best of our knowledge, WC and its association with groin hernia occurrence has not previously been described. Understanding if WC affects this risk will add valuable information to explain this unexpected difference.

Our aim here was to compare BMI to WC and their respective correlation to groin hernia surgery occurrence in both elective and emergency setting in males and females by crosslinking data from one regional and two national patient registers. Our hypothesis was that high BMI and/or WC prevents inguinal hernia occurrence and thus also prevents subsequent surgery.

A 35-day-old female infant presents to the pediatric emergency department with increased crying and persistent fullness in the right groin. On examination, the infant was noted to have increased fullness and a nonreducible mass in the right mons pubis. Point-of-care ultrasound was used to help diagnose an incarcerated ovary, allowing for expedited care while waiting for confirmatory imaging. The infant underwent surgery with salvage of the ovary.

Results

Study population

In 2019, 607 patients had undergone inguinal hernia surgery in our hernia repair expertise center. Of 201 patients, a preoperative ultrasound of the groin area was available. All these ultrasounds were reported to be positive for inguinal hernia. Patients with a negative ultrasound had not undergone inguinal hernia surgery. In all of the 406 operated patients who did not have an ultrasound examination prior to surgery, the diagnosis of inguinal hernia was confirmed during the surgery. Of the 201 patients with a positive ultrasound, 26 ultrasounds were excluded because they were performed earlier than 6 months prior to surgery (n = 17) or not performed in our hospital (n = 9). There were no patients with an incarcerated, strangulated inguinal hernia (medical emergency) or sports hernia. Thus, 175 patients were included in this study. There was only one patient with a lipoma. Some data were missing for the following variables: hernia size, work experience of the ultrasound technician and work experience of the radiologist.

The study population consisted of 162 men (92.6%) and 13 women (7.4%), with a mean age of 57.1 ± 14.7 years. In 129 (73.7%) cases, the groin ultrasound was requested by the GP, the surgeon requested 27 (15.4%) cases, 4 (2.3%) cases were requested by other specialists and data of 15 (8.6%) cases were missing. The linear array probe L12–5 (5–12 MHz) was used most often; 82 times (46.9%), followed by the linear array probes 9L4 which was used 53 times (30.5%) and 14L5 16 times (9.1%). The convex probes C5–1 and C9–2 were used 10 (5.5%) and 7 (4.0%) times. L12 3/4/6 have been used five times (2.9%) and 6C2 and L18–5 have both been used once (1.1%).

### The accuracy of ultrasound in the diagnosis of clinically occult groin hernias in adults [^116y65jT]. European Radiology (2005). Low credibility.

This prospective study examined the accuracy of ultrasound in diagnosing occult groin hernias in adults. The study included 52 consecutive patients reviewed in the surgical out-patient clinic with a history suggestive of groin hernia but with a normal or inconclusive clinical examination. Each patient underwent a preliminary ultrasound examination by an experienced consultant radiologist who was aware that the patient had a history suggestive of a hernia but was blinded to the side of the symptoms. The patient then proceeded to herniography, and some patients also had surgical exploration. The results of the ultrasound were assessed in relation to the herniography, and the patients who proceeded to surgical exploration had further correlation with surgery. Ultrasound had a sensitivity of 29% and specificity of 90% compared with the herniography. Correlation with surgical findings showed ultrasound to have a sensitivity of 33% and a specificity of 100%. The sensitivity of ultrasound in detecting clinically occult hernias in a non-acute presentation is poor, and patients with normal ultrasound should be considered for further investigation.

### The tip of the iceberg: lipomatous tumours presenting as abdominal or pelvic wall hernias [^116n8h9o]. Insights Into Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Case presentations

Indirect inguinal hernias

Case 1A

A 63-year-old woman presented with abdominal distension and increased weight, after having a lipomatous tumour being resected 10 years ago. CT shows the inferior epigastric vessels which are stretched over the tumour. Histopathology confirmed recurrence of a well-differentiated liposarcoma (Fig. 2).

Fig. 2
Left panel: Axial non-contrast-enhanced CT: a large pelvic mass predominantly of fat density is seen to compress and displace the bladder anteriorly. Part of the mass also extends into the right groin lateral to the epigastric vessels which are stretched over the lesion medially (red arrows). The white arrowhead points towards the origin of the inferior epigastric vessels from the external iliac vessels. Right panel: Coronal reconstruction of a non-contrast-enhanced CT, demonstrating the hernial neck (red arrows) as the tumour extends into the right inguinal canal

Case 1B

A 34-year-old male presented with a rapidly enlarging abdominal mass which extended into his left groin. Although the swelling had been present for over a year, it had doubled in size in a few months' time (Fig. 3).

Fig. 3
Left panel: Coronal T1 TIRM-weighted MR image of the abdomen and pelvis: large intra-abdominal mass with areas of fat suppression suggesting a fat containing tumour. The tumour is seen to herniate through the left inguinal canal (red arrows). Right upper panel: Axial T1-weighted MR image of the pelvis: A large left indirect inguinal hernia is observed (red arrows). On T1-weighted imaging fat content is identified which would suggest liposarcoma. Right lower panel: Axial contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis: a large intra-pelvic lesion is observed herniating through a groin defect (white arrows) lateral to the inferior epigastric vessels (red arrow). It appears to be displacing and compressing the bladder posteriorly

CT and MR imaging confirmed areas of fat within the tumour on both modalities. On positron emission tomography computed tomography (PET CT), the tumour demonstrated a standardised uptake value (SUV) max of 3.8. No metastases were present at the time of imaging.

Patient was referred to a tertiary referral centre for soft tissue sarcomas, where biopsy and surgery were performed. Subsequently, the histopathology of the tumour proved to be a mammary type myofibroblastoma. This is a very rare benign tumour.

### Amyand's hernia: ultrasonography findings [^112dsWHQ]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Amyand's hernia is described as the presence of an appendix vermiformis in the inguinal hernia sac. The incidence of Amyand's hernia is approximately 1% of all inguinal hernias. Amyand's hernia is diagnosed intraoperatively or preoperatively with radiologic examinations.

Case Report

Two cases of Amyand's hernia, with and without acute appendicitis, are reported here. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Amyand's hernia is a rare entity, and physical signs, laboratory results, and symptoms are not always helpful in diagnosis. Preoperative diagnosis of Amyand's hernia is not straightforward, and is generally an incidental finding during surgery. Imaging modalities, including ultrasound, can be very useful for making this rare diagnosis.

### Omental torsion with left-sided inguinal hernia: a rare preoperative diagnosis [^111b2baY]. Clinical Imaging (2012). Low credibility.

Omental torsion is a rare disease. It can be difficult to identify if it is not clinically considered in the preoperative period, and this pathology may lead to an acute abdomen. We present the characteristic computed tomography findings and clinical particulars in a 34-year-old male patient with longstanding left inguinal hernia associated with an extraordinary diagnosis.

### The French and their hernias: prospective radiological differentiation of de garengeot from other groin hernias [^115UuSCY]. Journal of Radiology Case Reports (2013). Low credibility.

A femoral hernia containing an appendix, known as de Garengeot hernia, is an uncommon and potentially confusing presentation. Prompt differentiation of this condition from other groin hernias in an acute setting will influence management and reduce morbidity. Computed Tomography (CT) should be performed in all suspected cases and an awareness of likely CT findings can facilitate rapid pre-operative diagnosis. Despite this, we present only the fourth published case of prospective CT diagnosis of de Garengeot hernia.

### Ureteral inguinal hernia: an uncommon trap for general surgeons [^115uwowJ]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

There have been multiple case reports and case series quoted in the literature. Obesity and anterior displacement of the ipsilateral ureter from psoas muscle at L4 level seem to be among risk factors. Scarring from previous hernia repair has also been raised as another possible risk factor. Diagnosis can be made preoperatively or intraoperatively. Ipsilateral hydronephrosis with inguinal hernia should alert the clinician to the presence of ureter in the hernia. This would warrant a CT urography.

A ureteral inguinal hernia often does not lead to strangulation and obstructive uropathy due to the large size of majority of these inguinal hernias. The condition is often diagnosed incidentally, either during or after herniorrhaphy, when the ureter is inadvertently injured. In the case described, ureteral involvement was successfully identified during investigation for a urinary tract infection during a completely unrelated hospital admission. It is believed that the infection was a result of renal stones, a common and often asymptomatic condition; however, in the presence of abnormal anatomy, calculi had become obstructed in the mid ureter. With a low likelihood of passing the calculus spontaneously, appropriate intervention was initiated by the urology unit.

Not many patients, nor surgeons for that matter, are fortunate enough to have diagnosed a ureteral inguinal hernia before surgery is performed. If the diagnosis is made preoperatively, we suggest stenting the ureter preoperatively to facilitate identifying, reducing and preserving the ureter. This was the case with our patient.

However, the same approach as described above can be adopted in difficult cases where there is some ambiguity. We suggest an algorithm to identify such hernias to avoid the caveat of ureteric injury (figure 4). In an open inguinoscrotal hernia repair, if the hernia contains fat that does not meet the characteristics of a cord lipoma and lacks the presence of the classical peritoneal sac, the possibility of herniating retroperitoneal structures, particularly the ureter, should be raised. In this situation, careful reduction of the fat should be performed. If the fat is completely irreducible, careful dissection at the level of the deep ring should be sought to avoid damaging a ureter.

### Using point-of-care ultrasound to characterize acute inguinal swelling of young children in the pediatric emergency department [^112Dh82u]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Acute inguinal swelling in young children is frequently assumed to be an inguinal hernia, often prompting a bedside reduction attempt. We report 3 cases of inguinal swelling where the use of point-of-care ultrasound changed the patients' management by identifying an alternate diagnosis, thus avoiding unnecessary and painful procedures as well as their associated sedation risks.

Direct inguinal hernia

Case 2

A 56-year-old male was referred for evaluation of an intra-pelvic lipomatous tumour discovered incidentally on CT colonoscopy, performed for a recent weight loss of 10 kg. Unfortunately, no histology was available for this patient; however, radiological features are in keeping with a lipomatous lesion. Open mesh repair of the hernia was performed (Fig. 4).

Fig. 4
Left panel: Axial T1-weighted MR image of the pelvis: a lipomatous lesion arising within the pelvis and indenting the anterior bladder wall is seen with herniation (red arrows) medial to the epigastric vessels in keeping with a direct inguinal hernia. Right panel: Sagittal T1-weighted MR image of the pelvis: red arrows outline the neck of the direct inguinal hernia containing a lipomatous lesion. The hernial sac content is bright on T1 in keeping with fat, the presence of internal septations and 'haziness' of the fat content suggest pathology other than a simple lipomatous lesion

Epigastric hernia

Case 3

A 60-year-old female presented with an enlarging lump in the epigastrium, which had doubled in size over a period of 6 months. Consequently, she was referred to our centre by her general practitioner (GP). Morphologic histopathology findings were in keeping with an ALT (demonstrated by oedema and fibrosis present within the lesion) (Fig. 5).

Fig. 5
Top panel: Axial T1-weighted image of the upper abdomen: arrows delineate the defect in the anterior abdominal wall. The hernia sac contains fat with internal striations. Bottom left panel: Sagittal T1-weighted image of the upper abdomen: demonstrates an epigastric hernia with the hernial neck outlined by the red arrows. The hernial sac contents are of fat signal intensity and histology proved to be in keeping with ALT. Bottom right panel: Sagittal T1 TIRM-weighted image of the upper abdomen: Red arrows outline the epigastric hernia which demonstrates suppression on fat saturated sequences confirming the presence of a fat containing tumour. The presence of high signal septae suggests an atypical lipomatous tumour radiologically

### Amyand hernia: as seen on point-of-care emergency ultrasound [^114YVCvZ]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Amyand hernia is a rare type of inguinal hernia defined by the presence of the appendix in the inguinal hernia sac. Clinical diagnosis of Amyand hernia can be challenging because this diagnosis is typically made intraoperatively, often as an incidental finding. Preoperative diagnosis by computed tomography and radiology ultrasound has previously been reported; however, there exists no reports of the diagnosis being made by point-of-care ultrasound. We present a case of Amyand hernia visible on point-of-care ultrasound performed by a pediatric emergency medicine physician.

### Positive predictive value of ultrasound in correctly identifying an inguinal hernia: a single-centered retrospective pilot study [^116d55Tq]. Insights Into Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

Patients with a FP ultrasound result undergo potentially unnecessary surgery. This results in unnecessary costs, potential complications and is unlikely to solve the symptoms of the patient. Postoperative complications occur in approximately 15–28% of operated inguinal hernia patients.

Aim

The primary aim of this pilot study was to investigate to what extent the diagnosis inguinal hernia on preoperative ultrasound corresponded to the perioperative findings during inguinal hernia surgery. In addition, we aimed to identify factors that may contribute to FP preoperative ultrasounds.

Lumbar hernias

Case 6A

A 71-year-old female presented with right sided colicky abdominal pain. She was worked up for biliary colic and a large lipomatous lesion measuring up to 19 cm was identified on cross-sectional imaging. Its size and radiological appearance suggested an atypical lipomatous lesion. On cytogenetic analysis, there was no MDM2 or CDK4 amplification (Fig. 8).

Case 6B

A 63-year-old gentleman presented with a long-standing swelling on the posterior chest wall which had become slightly tender recently. An MRI was performed which revealed a left lumbar hernia containing a fat predominant retroperitoneal mass as an incidental finding (Fig. 9).

### Paratesticular liposarcoma masquerading as an inguinal hernia [^116ugWem]. Urology (2018). Low credibility.

A man with left scrotal swelling felt to represent inguinal hernia underwent computed tomography scan for reported bleeding after prostate biopsy. Computed tomography scan revealed a 15-cm extratesticular left scrotal mass containing both fat and soft tissue components, raising concern for dedifferentiated liposarcoma. At surgery and pathology, the mass was separate from the left testis, epididymis, and spermatic cord. Histopathologic findings were consistent with paratesticular dedifferentiated liposarcoma.

### Diagnosis and classification of inguinal hernias [^1167BA8b]. Surgical Endoscopy (2003). Low credibility.

Background

The aim of this prospective clinical study was to determine whether the presence of a hernia, its size, and its type can be established preoperatively by clinical and ultrasound, examination.

Methods

The study population comprised 220 consecutive patients referred to our department for the surgical management of an inguinal hernia. On admission, both inguinal regions were examined clinically and by ultrasound. All patients were operated on laparoscopically.

Results

In regard to the intraoperative findings for both inguinal regions, clinical and ultrasound examination for the diagnosis of inguinal hernia yielded a high total rate of accuracy of 93% respective 94%. However, when the same methods were used to differentiate between lateral and medial hernia, the total rate of accuracy fell to only 54% respective 62%. In the determination of inguinal hernia size, it was even lower: 50% respective 53%.

Conclusions

Although a diagnosis of inguinal hernia can be established reliably by clinical and ultrasound examination, only an approximate classification is possible by these methods.

### A case of De garengeot hernia requiring early surgery [^117C6p78]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

De Garengeot hernia is a rare clinical entity defined as the presence of a vermiform appendix within a femoral hernia sac. A 50-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with a painful lump over her right groin region. A bedside ultrasound was performed and soft tissue lesion was suspected. CT was performed and revealed a swollen tubular structure with fat stranding within the mass. De Garengeot hernia with acute appendicitis was diagnosed preoperatively, and an emergency appendectomy and hernioplasty were performed. Although it is usually an incidental finding during hernioplasty, De Garengeot hernia should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with an incarcerated femoral hernia. Mesh repair can be performed depending on the clinical situation. We report a rare case of incarcerated femoral hernia with acute appendicitis that required early surgical management to avoid associated complications.

### Vasitis: a rare diagnosis mimicking inguinal hernia: a case report [^116KyWma]. BMC Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Vasitis or inflammation of the vas deferens is a rare condition, and few case reports with computed tomography images have been published since 1980.

Case presentation

A 50-year-old man presented with severe right inguinal and lower abdominal pain. Initial diagnosis at the emergency department was incarcerated or strangulated inguinal hernia. The computed tomography scan revealed diffuse edematous changes of right spermatic cord and vas deferens with peripheral fat stranding. Correlating with his clinical symptoms, signs, and imaging findings, the diagnosis of vasitis was made. We report a case of acute vasitis about the cause, symptom, pathogen, differential diagnoses, image findings, and treatment.

Conclusion

Although very rare, vasitis should be listed as one of the differential diagnosis for inguinal mass lesions. Cross-sectional imaging may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and exclude differentials such as an inguinal hernia. Recognition of the characteristic image findings can help to make the correct diagnosis and avoid unnecessary surgery.

Both epiploic appendagitis and femoral herniae are rare diagnoses individually. No radiological cases of a patient having epiploic appendagitis within a femoral hernia have been documented in the literature. We present a case of a 65-year-old patient who underwent clinical work-up for a tender left groin lump. When undergoing a CT scan for investigating possible lymphadenopathy, she was found to have epiploic appendagitis contained within an incarcerated left sided femoral hernia. In this case report, we review the relevant anatomy, aetiology, patient demographics, as well as clinical and imaging findings and management.

### Audit of ultrasound and decision to operate in groin pain of unknown aetiology with ultrasound technique explained [^111fgxZR]. Clinical Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

Aim

To determine the ability of a groin ultrasound service to identify inguinal/femoral hernias in patients with groin pain and equivocal clinical signs, and to evaluate the number of positive cases undergoing surgery.

Methods and Materials

A retrospective review of 243 examinations performed during the period January 2000 to June 2004 was undertaken. The referral information, as well as details of the examination and subsequent follow-up, were obtained through our hospital/radiological information system.

Results

Of 243 patients, 92 (38%) were referrals from general practitioners and 151 (62%) were hospital referrals. The examinations were performed by radiology consultants or specialist registrars, the former accounting for 228 examinations (94%). The age range of the patients was 3 months to 88 years (mean age = 48.7), with a male to female ratio of 3.2:1. One hundred and forty-three examinations were negative for hernias. Two of these patients underwent groin explorations and were found to be normal. The rest were discharged and none returned with related complaints. Ninety-four examinations (39%) were positive for hernias, as a result of which 62 patients underwent surgery. Of these, only four were found to be false-positives giving a positive predictive value of 94% in operated patients. Three scans were equivocal, and three were positive for other conditions.

Conclusion

In patients with equivocal clinical signs, groin ultrasound is a useful tool for identifying hernias, and therefore, aids surgical management.

Inguinal hernia

Inguinal hernia is the commonest type of abdominal wall hernia (up to 80%). They are most often acquired and have a male predominance with M:F ratio of upto 7:1. Table 5 lists some other differentials for a mass in the inguinal canal.

Table 5
Differentials for inguinal canal mass that may be seen on prostate MRI

Inguinal hernias may be direct or indirect, with indirect being five times more common. Direct hernias by contrast often descend through a weakened defect in the abdominal wall transversalis fascia within the Hesselbach triangle which is bordered by the rectus abdominis muscle medially, inferior epigastric vessels superolaterally and the inguinal ligament inferiorly. Hence, direct inguinal hernias occur inferomedial to the inferior epigastric vessels. Indirect hernias are more common, pass through the deep inguinal ring, usually anterior to the spermatic cord and lateral to the inferior epigastric vessels and Hesselbach triangle.

In men, the contents of the hernia can extend through the superficial ring into the scrotum, while in women, they can follow the round ligament into the labia majora. Hernias may contain intra-abdominal fat or bowel, either small bowel or large bowel or rarely reproductive organs. When containing bowel the hernias may become obstructed in which case the bowel loops will become distended with surrounding fat stranding and fluid. Although diagnosis is usually made based on clinical examination, ultrasound and/ or CT, MRI can help identify occult inguinal hernia, although this is not standard practice given the associated increased and often unnecessary costs.

Occasionally evidence of prior mesh repair or plugs may be seen. A mesh often appears as low signal on T1/T2 with adjacent susceptibility artefact. Plugs often appear as rounded masses at the opening of the internal ring, and they often appear low signal on T1 and T2 but depending on surrounding inflammatory response and timing of the operation may have mixed signal intensities (Fig. 20).

Differential diagnosis

The clinical picture of a tender right groin mass is commonly associated with an incarcerated or strangulated femoral or inguinal hernia, and the patient may be feverish and laboratory values can be atypical. De Garengeot hernia should be suspected in an elderly woman presenting with signs and symptoms of a strangulated hernia. The differential diagnosis should include, in addition to inguinal hernia, adnexitis, a varix node, ectasia of the Vena saphena magna, lipomas or other soft tissue tumours, lymphomas and hypostatic abscesses in retroperitoneal processes. In our case, the patient had already been diagnosed with De Garengeot hernia by her GP after having CT scan.

### Inguinal hernias: diagnosis and management [^111VmaKa]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Groin hernias are caused by a defect of the abdominal wall in the groin area and comprise inguinal and femoral hernias. Inguinal hernias are more common in men. Although groin hernias are easily diagnosed on physical examination in men, ultrasonography is often needed in women. Ultrasonography is also helpful when a recurrent hernia, surgical complication after repair, or other cause of groin pain (e.g., groin mass, hydrocele) is suspected. Magnetic resonance imaging has higher sensitivity and specificity than ultrasonography and is useful for diagnosing occult hernias if clinical suspicion is high despite negative ultrasound findings. Herniography, which involves injecting contrast media into the hernial sac, may be used in selected patients. Becoming familiar with the common types of surgical interventions can help family physicians facilitate postoperative care and assess for complications, including recurrence. Laparoscopic repair is associated with shorter recovery time, earlier resumption of activities of daily living, less pain, and lower recurrence rates than open repair. Watchful waiting is a reasonable and safe option in men with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic inguinal hernias. Watchful waiting is not recommended in patients with symptomatic hernias or in nonpregnant women.

### Positive predictive value of ultrasound in correctly identifying an inguinal hernia: a single-centered retrospective pilot study [^1145HQN2]. Insights Into Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

Data analysis

Data were analyzed using SPSS version 26 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). The primary outcome of this pilot study was the PPV of ultrasound for the diagnosis of inguinal hernia in need of surgery. PPV was calculated for the complete study population and separately for the study population without a (visible) swelling and/or a positive Valsalva maneuver. Perioperative findings were considered the golden standard and were classified as positive or negative for inguinal hernia based on the operative reports. If intestine or adipose tissue protruded through a weakness in the abdominal wall, the inguinal or femoral canal, the patient was classified as positive. Inguinal preperitoneal lipomas were also classified as positive. All other (incidental) findings, such as an obturator hernia (unless accordingly classified by ultrasound), were classified as negative.

Herniating preperitoneal lipoma was considered as positive because they can resemble true inguinal hernias and can be treated in the same manner. Protrusion through the internal inguinal ring of extraperitoneal fat or of peritoneum with its content is both capable of producing the symptoms and signs of an inguinal hernia and should be considered equally as important as consequences of distorted regional anatomy. That is, both herniated extraperitoneal fat and herniated peritoneum and its contents are true inguinal hernias.

To identify potential predictors of FP ultrasounds, we determined whether there was a significant difference between the group patients with FP and true positive (TP) ultrasound with respect to patient age, gender, BMI, previous abdominal surgery, work experience of the ultrasound technician (years), work experience of the radiologist (years), the size of the inguinal hernia on ultrasound (cm) and the time between the preoperative ultrasound and the day of surgery. For normally distributed continuous variables (age and BMI), the independent t test was used and for continuous variables with a skewed distribution (time between ultrasound and surgery) the Mann–Whitney U test. The Fisher's exact test was used for dichotomous variables (sex and previous abdominal surgery) and the Chi-square test for nominal and ordinal variables (work experience and hernia size).

Continuous variables with a normal distribution were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD) and continuous variables with a skewed distribution as median with interquartile range. Categorical variables were expressed as percentages.

### Natural history of groin hernias in women and factors leading to delay in repair: a single-institution study [^113jHLy7]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

Of the 1331 patients identified in the database who underwent elective inguinal hernia repair during the five-year study period, 112 (8.4%) met the initial inclusion criteria. Thirty-one patients (2.3%) who had incidental groin hernias repaired at the time of abdominal wall reconstruction and 1 (0.1%) with incomplete records were excluded. The final cohort comprised of 80 (6%) female patients. The mean age of participants was 61.2 years (± 15.4, range 23–92), and majority were Caucasian (68.8%), and non-smokers (92.5%) (Table 1).

Table 1
Demographics (N = 80)

Preoperative characteristics

The majority of patients were overweight with a mean BMI of 27.3 (± 5.8, range 16.4–48.9) and were majority ASA III (67.5%). The most common symptoms encountered included non-specific groin pain (73.8%) and an intermittent groin bulge (48.8%). Many patients (40%) experienced symptoms for > 1 year, while 33.8% experienced symptoms for less than 3 months (Fig. 2). Patients averaged 1.2 clinic visits regarding their hernia and waited an average of 22.6 (range 1–90) days prior to seeing a surgeon. While majority (60%) were in-network referrals, there was no significant difference with respect to the duration of symptoms prior to surgical repair when compared with those referred out-of-network or self-referrals, respectively (p = 0.934). Sixty-three patients (78.8%) had preoperative imaging. The most common modality was Computed Tomography (CT) (56.8%), followed by Ultrasound (US) (39.2%) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) (4.0%) (Table 2).

### Ultrasonography in diagnosing clinically occult groin hernia: systematic review and meta-analysis [^115gFHqz]. European Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

To provide an updated systematic review on the performance of ultrasonography (US) in diagnosing clinically occult groin hernia.

Methods

A systematic search was performed in MEDLINE and Embase. Methodological quality of included studies was assessed. Accuracy data of US in detecting clinically occult groin hernia were extracted. Positive predictive value (PPV) was pooled with a random effects model. For studies investigating the performance of US in hernia type classification (inguinal vs femoral), correctly classified proportion was assessed.

Results

Sixteen studies were included. In the two studies without verification bias, sensitivities were 29.4% [95% confidence interval (CI), 15.1–47.5%] and 90.9% (95% CI, 70.8–98.9%); specificities were 90.0% (95% CI, 80.5–95.9%) and 90.6% (95% CI, 83.0–95.6%). Verification bias or a variation of it (i.e. study limited to only subjects with definitive proof of disease status) was present in all other studies. Sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive value (NPV) were not pooled. PPV ranged from 58.8 to 100%. Pooled PPV, based on data from ten studies with low risk of bias and no applicability concerns with respect to patient selection, was 85.6% (95% CI, 76.5–92.7%). Proportion of correctly classified hernias, based on data from four studies, ranged between 94.4% and 99.1%.

Conclusions

Sensitivity, specificity and NPV of US in detecting clinically occult groin hernia cannot reliably be determined based on current evidence. Further studies are necessary. Accuracy may strongly depend on the examiner's skills. PPV is high. Inguinal and femoral hernias can reliably be differentiated by US.

Key Points

- Sensitivity, specificity and NPV of ultrasound in detecting clinically occult groin hernia cannot reliably be determined based on current evidence.
- Accuracy may strongly depend on the examiner's skills.
- PPV of US in detection of clinically occult groin hernia is high [pooled PPV of 85.6% (95% confidence interval, 76.5–92.7%)].
- US has very high performance in correctly differentiating between clinically occult inguinal and femoral hernia (correctness of 94.4–99.1%).

### Sports hernia: diagnosis and therapeutic approach [^1169mzz7]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2007). Low credibility.

Groin pain is a common entity in athletes involved in soccer, ice hockey, Australian Rules football, skiing, running, and hurdling. An increasingly recognized cause of groin pain in these athletes is a sports hernia, an occult hernia caused by weakness or tear of the posterior inguinal wall, without a clinically recognizable hernia, that leads to a condition of chronic groin pain. The patient typically presents with an insidious onset of activity-related, unilateral, deep groin pain that abates with rest. Although the physical examination reveals no detectable inguinal hernia, a tender, dilated superficial inguinal ring and tenderness of the posterior wall of the inguinal canal are found. The role of imaging studies in this condition is unclear; most imaging studies will be normal. Unlike most other types of groin pain, sports hernias rarely improve with nonsurgical measures; thus, open or laparoscopic herniorrhaphy should be considered.

### Imaging of abdominal wall masses, masslike lesions, and diffuse processes [^117EYrHL]. Radiographics (2020). Medium credibility.

Abdominal wall masses, masslike lesions, and diffuse processes are common and often incidental findings at cross-sectional imaging. Distinguishing among these types of masses on the basis of imaging features alone can be challenging. The authors present a diagnostic algorithm that may help in distinguishing different types of abdominal wall masses accurately. Hernias may mimic discrete masses at clinical examination, and imaging is often ordered for evaluation of a possible abdominal wall mass. Once a discrete mass is confirmed to be present, the next step is to determine if it is a fat-containing, cystic, or solid mass. The most common fat-containing masses are lipomas. Fluid or cystic masses include postoperative abscesses, seromas, and rectus sheath hematomas. Solid masses are the most common abdominal wall masses and include desmoid tumors, sarcomas, endometriomas, and metastases. Multiple masses and other diffuse abdominal wall processes are often manifestations of an underlying condition or insult. The most frequently found diffuse processes are multiple injection granulomas from administration of subcutaneous medication. This article offers an algorithmic approach to characterizing abdominal wall masses on the basis of their composition and reviews abdominal wall diffuse processes.

### Positive predictive value of ultrasound in correctly identifying an inguinal hernia: a single-centered retrospective pilot study [^112xcnCo]. Insights Into Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In our study, we found a PPV of preoperative ultrasound to predict an inguinal hernia in need of surgery of 90.9%; in other words 9.1% of patients underwent surgery without having an inguinal hernia. This finding is in line with previously reported PPVs. We also identified factors that are associated with a FP ultrasound when an inguinal hernia is suspected, which, to the best of our knowledge, has not been done before in this setting.

Awareness of these factors may influence the diagnostic approach by considering alternative imaging modalities such as CT or MRI.

Although the PPV of preoperative ultrasound to diagnose inguinal hernia was investigated before, only some of these studies used surgery as golden standard. By using surgery as golden standard, a reliable PPV could be established in this retrospective study.

A higher BMI was identified as a potential predictor for FP results (p = 0.043). Ultrasound is difficult to perform in obese patients due to the increased distance to the target tissue. It is more difficult to distinguish fatty tissue from material of a hernia. Moreover, the increased depth of the inguinal canal complicates identification. Compared to MRI and CT, ultrasound is the modality that is most constrained by obesity.

Related literature

Accuracy of ultrasonography is in general known to be dependent on the experience of the technician. This has however not yet been determined for inguinal hernias. We could not find a significant difference between the experience of the examiners in the FP and TP ultrasound group.

A few studies compared the accuracy of ultrasound technicians to radiologists. No studies were found specifically for ultrasound examination of the groin. Dawkins et al. found an interpretation discrepancy rate of abdominal ultrasounds of 15.5% with radiologists more likely to correctly assess the ultrasounds. However, this difference was not statistically significant. A systematic review by Kwee et al. registered whether the ultrasound was interpreted by a radiologist or a technician; similar results emerged from these studies.

In our hospital, the ultrasound technicians work under the strict supervision of radiologists. At the slightest doubt, the radiologist was present during the ultrasound examination. We can therefore safely assume that this had no influence on FP results.

In the past, peritoneography was the first imaging modality of choice for the diagnosis of inguinal/femoral hernia. Current guidelines do not recommend this, given that significant abnormalities like a preperitoneal lipoma cannot be seen. Nowadays an MRI or CT scan is recommended when the anamnesis, physical examination and ultrasound are inconclusive.

Objective

The purpose of this article is to show the typical locations of anterior abdominal wall and inguinal region hernias and to illustrate their sonographic appearances and describe pitfalls in clinical diagnosis of hernias that may be resolved with sonography.

Conclusion

Awareness of the expected locations of anterior abdominal wall hernias and potential clinical pitfalls allows an accurate diagnosis of a hernia and helps in differentiating a hernia from other abnormalities.

### Groin hernia [^114R1JuK]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2025). High credibility.

Groin hernias are among the most common indications for surgery worldwide, affecting both men and women, with a significantly higher prevalence in men. These hernias occur when intra-abdominal contents protrude through a weakened area in the groin region, most commonly as inguinal or femoral hernias. The pathogenesis of groin hernias is a complex interplay of genetic predisposition, connective tissue abnormalities and mechanical strain. While watchful waiting is an option for some asymptomatic patients, surgical repair remains the definitive treatment, with both open and minimally invasive techniques available. Tension-free mesh repair has significantly reduced the overall recurrence rates and is now the standard approach in adults in most clinics. However, tissue-based repairs are still preferred in select populations such as children, teenagers and those in resource-limited settings. Advances in laparoscopic and robotic-assisted techniques offer benefits such as reduced postoperative pain and faster recovery. Despite surgical advancements, complications, such as chronic postoperative pain and recurrence, continue to pose challenges. Future research aims to refine surgical techniques, look at mesh-related complications, develop bioengineered meshes and explore the genetic basis of hernia formation.

Case presentation

A 69-year-old healthy woman was referred by her general practitioner (GP) for CT-proven appendicitis present in right-sided femoral hernia (figure 1). For the past 7 days, she had noticed a lump in her right groin which was initially reducible and associated with mild discomfort on exertion, but it was getting more painful during the past 24 hours accompanied by low-grade fever. She denied nausea, vomiting and her bowel motion was normal. The patient saw her GP due to worsening of the pain, and an ultrasound was organised which demonstrated a right-sided femoral hernia below the inguinal ligament that contained the appendix. There was a small amount of fluid around the appendix and increased vascularity which was suggestive of appendicitis. CT was then ordered by patient's primary physician and the scan confirmed the presence of an inflamed appendix inside femoral hernia sac; therefore she was transferred to emergency department. She was an independent, non-smoker woman with no significant medical history apart from mild gastro-oesophageal reflux and vaginal hysterectomy 20 years ago.

### Watchful waiting versus totally extraperitoneal (TEP) hernia repair for occult inguinal hernia and pain (EFFECT trial)-a multicenter, non-inferiority, randomized controlled trial [^116hLcsn]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Existing literature provides limited information on patients with inguinal pain and occult inguinal hernias. Only a few cohort studies with small sample sizes have evaluated this population, all of which have shown positive outcomes for conservative management at longer follow-up periods. At a median follow-up of 9 months, Corvatta et al. reported that pain was resolved in 54% of their patients (n = 98), which occurred spontaneously in 75% of the population, while the remaining 25% required medical treatment. However, this medical treatment was not specified. Melloy et al. observed a higher number of pain-free patients (68%, n = 42) after 3 years of non-operative management. Similar to Corvatta et al. they did not clarify what kind of non-operative management was executed, but surprisingly, no participants received physiotherapy. Both studies focused on a WW strategy without comparing pain scores to those of a surgically treated group, limiting the ability to draw definitive clinical conclusions. In contrast, Aly et al. examined the outcomes using the EuraHS-QoL instrument in 32 surgically treated and 31 conservatively treated patients with groin pain and an occult inguinal hernia. The validated EuroHS-QoL instrument used in their study was similar to the method used in the present study. They found no statistically significant differences in outcomes between the two groups. However, detailed information on the follow-up period and specific treatment strategies is lacking. These limitations inhibit adequate comparison with our results.

The ultrasound-detected occult inguinal hernia could be either the true cause of complaints, an incidental finding alongside a different underlying cause, or a false-positive finding reflecting normal anatomy. If patients with inguinal pain and an occult inguinal hernia experience pain due to a genuine or early-stage inguinal hernia, it is likely that they will require surgery over time. Notably, the intraoperative findings of this study demonstrated abnormalities of the abdominal wall in 85% of the operated groins, which comprised weakness of the posterior abdominal wall, dilation of the inguinal ring, lipoma, inguinal hernia, or a combination of the aforementioned abnormalities. These findings are consistent with those of van Hout et al. who studied a population similar to ours and reported that 87% of their patients (n = 179) had a hernia defect, lipoma, or weak posterior wall. These findings may help explain why surgery is effective in case of an occult inguinal hernia and associated inguinal pain.

US examination must provide the following assessments:
Assessment of the muscle tendon unit of the abdominal and adductor muscles.
Dynamic assessment of the inguinal canal structures.
Assessment of internal organs.
Assessment of the urinary tract and external genitalia.

US examination should be performed by a radiologist with specific expertise on GrPS imaging. Furthermore the presence of both a radiologist and a general surgeon is strongly recommended during the US examination. The presence of the surgeon during US examination is required in order to help rule out or confirm the diagnosis of inguinal or femoral hernia helping the radiologist both to identify the anatomical landmarks of the defect and the interpretation of the dynamic images. Furthermore direct and indirect hernia may be distinguished. The surgeon can also perform the examination of the superficial inguinal ring and canal under US guidance and emphasise the site of bulging.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® hernia [^116mgPb9]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Abdominopelvic hernias are common clinical entities composed of a wide variety of congenital, traumatic, and iatrogenic etiologies. Any weakness in the body wall may result in hernia of cavity contents with concomitant risks of morbidity and mortality. Presentations may be specific, palpable body wall mass/bulge, or vague, nonspecific pain through bowel obstruction. This document focuses on initial imaging of the adult population with signs of symptoms prompting suspicion of abdominopelvic hernia. Imaging of the abdomen and pelvis to evaluate defects is essential for prompt diagnosis and treatment. Often CT and ultrasound are the first-line modalities to quickly evaluate the abdomen and pelvis, providing for accurate diagnoses and management of patients. MRI protocols may be useful as first-line imaging studies, especially in patients with orthopedic instrumentation. Although often performed, abdominal radiographs and fluorographic procedures may provide indirect evidence of hernias but are usually not indicated for initial diagnosis of hernia. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel.

### Adult abdominal hernias [^115BLbep]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2014). Low credibility.

Educational Objectives and Key Points. 1. Given that abdominal hernias are a frequent imaging finding, radiologists not only are required to interpret the appearances of abdominal hernias but also should be comfortable with identifying associated complications and postrepair findings. 2. CT is the imaging modality of choice for the assessment of a known adult abdominal hernia in both elective and acute circumstances because of rapid acquisition, capability of multiplanar reconstruction, good spatial resolution, and anatomic depiction with excellent sensitivity for most complications. 3. Ultrasound is useful for adult groin assessment and is the imaging modality of choice for pediatric abdominal wall hernia assessment, whereas MRI is beneficial when there is reasonable concern that a patient's symptoms could be attributable to a hernia or a musculoskeletal source. 4. Fluoroscopic herniography is a sensitive radiologic investigation for patients with groin pain in whom a hernia is suspected but in whom a hernia cannot be identified at physical examination. 5. The diagnosis of an internal hernia not only is a challenging clinical diagnosis but also can be difficult to diagnose with imaging: Closed-loop small-bowel obstruction and abnormally located bowel loops relative to normally located small bowel or colon should prompt assessment for an internal hernia.

### Ureteral inguinal hernia: an uncommon trap for general surgeons [^111w2B5k]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Treatment

They proceeded to having a cystoureteroscopy and stent insertion was performed by a urologist who was unable to retrieve the calculus. This was due to the looping nature of the distal right ureter within a sliding irreducible inguinal hernia. Intraoperative retrograde pyelogram showed a 'fish hook' appearance of the distal ureter (figure 3).

Figure 3
Intraoperative retrograde pyelogram showing the right ureter (A) before and (B) after inguinal hernia repair. Note the position of the ureter in relation to the prosthesis in (A) as it extends below the right superior pubic rami.

The patient was referred to the general surgical unit and after a preoperative assessment he proceeded to having an elective open right inguinal hernia repair with mesh (Lichtenstein repair). Intraoperatively, a sliding indirect hernia was identified containing fat which was initially thought to be a large lipoma of the cord. Careful dissection of the fatty tissue eventually revealed a deeper component with a large broad base extending from the internal ring. The surgical team concluded that this was actually retroperitoneal fat which was further dissected, exposed and suture-ligated before excision. The right ureter, with a palpable stent in situ, was easily identified and preserved throughout. The inguinal canal was short with a weak posterior wall and there was no appreciable sac, nor any intraperitoneal structures found.

### From inguinal hernias to spermatic cord lipomas: pearls, pitfalls, and mimics of abdominal and pelvic hernias [^111Kggiz]. Radiographics (2017). Low credibility.

Abdominal and pelvic hernias may be indolent and detected incidentally, manifest acutely with pain and distress, or cause chronic discomfort. Physical examination findings are often ambiguous and insufficient for optimal triage. Therefore, accurate anatomic delineation and identification of complications are critical for effective treatment planning. Imaging, particularly computed tomography, provides a vital understanding of the hernia's location and size, involved viscera, and severity of associated complications. Reader familiarity with the imaging appearances and anatomic landmarks of hernias is important for correct diagnosis, which may impact preoperative planning and reduce morbidity. This article reviews the appearance of anatomic structures in the abdominal wall and pelvis that are important for diagnosing common and uncommon abdominal and pelvic hernias, and it highlights key imaging features that are helpful for differentiating hernias, mimics, and their complications.

### Unusual presentation of spontaneous ruptured hepatocellular carcinoma: inguinal hernia [^1126eArH]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Spontaneous ruptured hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a life-threatening condition despite improvements in diagnostic methods and established treatment strategies. Although typical clinical presentations of spontaneous ruptured HCC facilitate easy diagnosis, this condition can present with unexpectedly varied symptoms, making diagnosis challenging. We describe an atypical clinical presentation of spontaneous ruptured HCC mimicking an inguinal hernia. A 66-year-old man presented to the emergency department with groin discomfort and swelling, suggesting an inguinal hernia. He had no history of an inguinal hernia or known liver cirrhosis. Physical examination revealed a palpable, tender left groin mass. Point-of-care ultrasonography showed bowel-like structures with an echo-free space in the left groin. Unenhanced computed tomography (CT) of the pelvis demonstrated mesenteric fat prolapse and hyperdense fluid in the left inguinal canal and scrotum. Considering the possibility of a strangulated hernia, emergency exploratory laparotomy was performed. Unexpectedly, blood retention in the hernia sac was found, with no intestinal involvement. Further exploration revealed a hematoma and tumor on the liver surface. Finally, he was diagnosed with spontaneous ruptured HCC and underwent successful emergency hepatic resection. Spontaneous ruptured HCC can potentially mimic other abdominal conditions such as an inguinal hernia, even in cases of undiagnosed liver cirrhosis. Although unenhanced CT can reveal bloody ascites suggesting hemoperitoneum, the underlying cause should be carefully considered. Emergency physicians should recognize various clinical presentations of spontaneous ruptured HCC to ensure prompt diagnosis and treatment of this potentially fatal complication.

### Cord structure within an inguinal hernia: could the ureter be involved? [^113qm6QZ]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Figure 3
A proposed flowchart for the workup of a patient with an inguinal hernia and suspicion of ureteric involvement. *The choice of the type of surgery depends on the expertise of the surgeon, but the threshold for conversion to an open procedure should be low in the presence of urological organ involvement due to the increased risk of injury and potential complications. Author(s): Fatemeh Akbarpoor, Faisel Ikram. IV, intravenous.

It is essential to take care with such hernias to avoid injury to the ureter during herniorrhaphy or hernioplasty, especially for the novice surgeon. Surgeons should be cautious when seeing large amounts of fat in the hernia, as blunt dissection could result in direct injury to the ureter. Additionally, reviewing any imaging ordered preoperatively is essential to aid in planning the surgical procedure and avoid complications. In this case, the preoperative CT of the patient was not reviewed by the surgeon before the surgery as it was ordered for another purpose. Ordering and reviewing preoperative CT scans can help guide the surgeon's technique in large, incarcerated hernias that may contain retroperitoneal structures.

Learning points

A ureter being found in an inguinal hernia is a rare occurrence and its usually associated with large indirect hernias with copious amounts of fat.
This case underscores the importance of conducting a thorough work-up including any laboratory investigations and imaging prior to performing a surgery, even a routine one such as inguinal hernia repair.
Additionally, it is important to review imaging prior to surgery, even if ordered by colleagues from other specialties, since imaging can guide better planning of the surgery.
If there is a large inguinoscrotal hernia, coupled with lower urinary tract symptoms, there might be urological organ involvement hence ordering imaging such as CT urogram will aid in diagnosis and surgical planning.

### The AIUM practice parameter for the performance of an ultrasound examination of the abdomen and / or retroperitoneum [^115fi1qS]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Abdominal wall — When there are signs or symptoms referable to the abdominal wall, an ultrasound examination may be performed to evaluate for hernia, masses, fluid collections, or other abnormalities, and the examination should include images of the abdominal wall in the location of symptoms or signs and often necessitates scanning with a high-frequency, high-resolution transducer. The relationship of any identified mass to the peritoneum should be demonstrated, any defect in the peritoneum and abdominal wall musculature should be documented, and the presence or absence of bowel, fluid, organs, or other tissues contained within any abdominal wall defect should be noted. Valsalva maneuvers in supine and upright positioning may be helpful in hernia detection and determining reducibility, the inferior epigastric vessels are an important anatomic landmark in hernia characterization, and Doppler examination may be useful to evaluate for vascular flow in an abdominal mass; cine clip images can be useful to further define abdominal wall hernias.

### Amyand's hernia: a case report [^111WPjS8]. Journal of Radiology Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Amyand's hernia is a rare and atypical hernia characterized by the herniation of the appendix into the inguinal sac. This hernia may be present without symptoms until inflammation of the appendix may lead to incarceration, strangulation, necrosis, perforation or rupture. Early symptoms include tenderness and inguinal swelling which may be misdiagnosed as a strangulated hernia. This condition can be difficult to diagnose clinically. Ultrasound and Computed Tomography may aid in diagnosis. This article presents a rare case of Amyand's hernia followed by a discussion of the epidemiology, diagnosis, imaging details and treatment options for this condition.

### The tip of the iceberg: lipomatous tumours presenting as abdominal or pelvic wall hernias [^111HsDL6]. Insights Into Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Key points

Deep lipomatous tumours are often large but may present with a small herniating palpable mass
The herniating part of the tumour represents the 'tip of the iceberg', as the main part of the tumour is not detectable clinically and is underestimated
General ultrasound assessment of an inguinal hernia can be the moment of detecting a lipomatous tumour
If the herniating tissue is not fully accessible with ultrasound, additional cross-sectional imaging by CT or MRI is warranted
Referral to a specialised sarcoma treatment centre is needed before biopsy and resection, to avoid traversing uninvolved compartments and needle tract seeding

### Role of imaging in the diagnosis of occult hernias [^116UAZMN]. JAMA Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Importance

Occult hernias are symptomatic but not palpable on physical examination. This is more commonly seen with inguinal hernias. Early diagnosis and treatment of occult hernias are essential in relieving symptoms and improving patients' quality of life.

Objective

To determine the effectiveness of imaging-ultrasonography (US), computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) — in the diagnosis of occult inguinal hernia.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A retrospective medical records review of surgical patients with groin and pelvic pain, 2008–2013, was conducted in a single-surgeon hernia specialty practice. Thirty-six patients met the following inclusion criteria: (1) examination findings suggestive of but not necessarily diagnostic for inguinal hernia; (2) imaging of the groin and/or pelvis with US, CT, and MRI; and (3) an operation to address the groin or pelvic pain. Fifty-nine groins were included.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of US, CT, and MRI for detection of occult inguinal hernia.

Results

The number, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of each modality were, respectively: US (9, 0.33, 0, 1.00, and 0), CT (39, 0.54, 0.25, 0.86, and 0.06), and MRI (34, 0.91, 0.92, 0.95, and 0.85). Among multiply imaged groins in which CT examination missed a diagnosis of hernia, MRI correctly detected an occult hernia in 10 of 11 cases (91%).

Conclusions and Relevance

Ultrasonography and CT cannot reliably exclude occult groin abnormalities. Patients with clinical suspicion of inguinal hernia should undergo MRI as the definitive radiologic examination.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis of the role of radiology in the diagnosis of occult inguinal hernia [^113j2uSs]. Surgical Endoscopy (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Inguinal hernias are a common cause of groin pain. Most hernias are detectable by clinical examination and many patients proceed to hernia repair on the basis of history and examination findings alone. However, a significant proportion of patients with symptoms suggestive of groin hernia are found to have a normal clinical examination. Several radiological techniques have been developed to solve the dilemma posed by occult inguinal hernias. No systematic review or meta-analysis has addressed this common clinical problem.

Methods

A systematic review and meta-analysis were undertaken of relevant articles in Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane database. Studies were assessed using the QUADAS tool. Statistical analysis was undertaken.

Results

We have shown in this meta-analysis that ultrasound has a sensitivity of 86% and a specificity of 77% in occult inguinal hernias. Computed tomography has a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 65%. Herniography has a sensitivity of 91% and a specificity of 83%.

Conclusions

Based on this systematic review, herniography should be considered as the initial investigation for occult inguinal hernia where available. In centers where this is not available, ultrasound of the groin should be used with good clinical judgment. When there is still diagnostic uncertainty, further investigation with magnetic resonance imaging should be considered to exclude alternative pathology.

### Meta-analysis of sonography in the diagnosis of inguinal hernias [^115NtX1G]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Groin hernias are common conditions, and there is a need for accurate imaging when the clinical diagnosis is not clear. A meta-analysis was undertaken to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of sonography in the diagnosis of inguinal hernias. After review of literature searches, 9 original articles were included. Data were pooled and statistically analyzed. In the studies included, sensitivity ranged from 92.7% to 100%; specificity ranged from 22.2% to 100%; the positive predictive value ranged from 83.3 to 100%; and the negative predictive value ranged from 40 to 100%. Sonography has overall sensitivity of 96.6%, specificity of 84.8%, and a positive predictive value of 92.6%. In cases of diagnostic uncertainty, sonography offers value as an initial imaging modality. It has advantages over other radiologic methods, as it is inexpensive and has minimal complications. When the clinical diagnosis of an inguinal hernia is uncertain, sonographic findings should be interpreted in conjunction with clinical judgment, as its diagnostic accuracy is reduced in the absence of any clinically palpable hernia.

Investigations

Ultrasound can reveal the bowel contents in the hernia sac; however, the patient presented in an acute setting and CT scanning remains the gold standard for diagnosis. She had a CT scan of abdomen and pelvis which showed she had a right femoral hernia containing the appendix (figure 1). The appendix was perforated at its tip within the sac, significant local inflammatory and soft-tissue stranding (figure 2).

### Role of sonography in clinically occult femoral hernias [^1178x7PM]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of this article is to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of sonography in clinically occult femoral hernias and to describe our sonographic technique.

Methods

The clinical and imaging data for 93 outpatients referred by general surgeons, all of whom underwent sonographic evaluation and surgery, were reviewed retrospectively. Of these, 55 patients who underwent surgical exploration for groin hernias within 3 months of sonography and met all inclusion criteria were included in the study. The sonographic technique involves using the pubic tubercle as an osseous landmark to identify and appropriately visualize the femoral canal. The Valsalva maneuver is then used to differentiate the movement of normal fat (a potential pitfall) from true herniation in the femoral canal. Surgical findings were used as the reference standard by which sonographic results were judged. Two-by-two contingency tables were used to calculate the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value.

Results

In these 55 patients, surgery revealed 15 femoral hernias. Eight femoral hernias occurred in women, and 7 occurred in men. For diagnosing femoral hernias, sonography demonstrated sensitivity of 80%, specificity of 88%, a positive predictive value of 71%, and a negative predictive value of 92%. True-positive cases of femoral hernias have a sonographic appearance of a hypoechoic sac with speckled internal echoes. When examining during the Valsalva maneuver, a femoral hernia passes deep to the inguinal ligament, expands the femoral canal, displacing the normal canal fat, and effaces the femoral vein.

Conclusions

Sonography can exclude femoral hernias with high confidence in light of its exceptional negative predictive value. With attention to technique and imaging criteria, the diagnostic accuracy of sonography can be enhanced.

### Waist circumference is not superior to body mass index in predicting groin hernia repair in either men or women [^116gHSrU]. World Journal of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Female sex showed a lower risk for having surgery performed when diagnosed, which is inconsistent with guidelines. However, our study was not designed to evaluate causality. This potential correlation strongly calls for further research and a discussion among surgeons.

To the best of knowledge, associations between WC and groin hernia have not yet been studied whereas BMI has. WC is probably a more accurate measure than BMI in demonstrating the local abdominal fat distribution including visceral fat depots. BMI and WC follow each other closely when analyzed using a scatterplot. No measure seems to be superior to the other.

### The role of imaging in the pre-and postoperative evaluation of inguinal hernia [^114xhq3Z]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Inguinal hernia repair is the most frequently performed surgical procedure. Imaging has a fundamental role in initial assessment and postoperative evaluation of inguinal hernias. Clinical implications of radiology in the preoperative setting include diagnosis of occult/complicated hernias and enhancement of diagnostic certainty. Postoperatively, imaging may assist the detection and characterization of complications. Familiarity with the normal appearance of the postoperative groin area and surgical techniques is required to avoid misinterpretation. This pictorial essay provides an overview of the expected postoperative imaging findings and highlights the role of imaging in the pre- and postoperative evaluation of inguinal hernias, with emphasis on ultrasonography.

### Guidelines for laparoscopic (TAPP) and endoscopic (TEP) treatment of inguinal hernia [International Endohernia Society (IEHS)] [^114DpTcN]. Surgical Endoscopy (2011). Low credibility.

Even though some authors still advocate herniography for identifying impalpable herniations causing pain in athletes [64], today dynamic ultrasound should be the diagnostic tool of first choice.

CT scan and MRI

CT scan and MRI have been proposed as diagnostic tests for chronic groin pain, but the costs are such that their routine use for assessment of patients with groin pain cannot be justified [18]. Furthermore, MRI is not a useful tool for deciding between operative and conservative treatment [10].

Bone scan, plain radiography, and ultrasound has been used for diagnosing these entities, but MRI appears to be superior [45, 58, 61, 62]. A clinical and imaging diagnosis is crucial, because in PBSI there is no need for surgical intervention.

The use of CT scans could help to identify posterior inguinal wall deficiencies and hernias in some cases [56] and may be employed in difficult cases to help define the anatomical extent of a groin injury [18]. On the other hand, MRI provided an accurate depiction of pubic bone alterations and of adjacent myotendinous structures [6, 52] and also was very useful to determine the presence of inguinal hernias [6], because allows the direct visualization of the hernial sac within the inguinal canal. Athletes with groin pain and tenderness of the pubic symphysis and/or superior pubic ramus have clinical features consistent with the diagnosis of osteitis pubis. The increased signal intensity seen on MRI is due to pubic bone marrow edema. A stress injury to the pubic bone is the most likely explanation for these MRI findings.

### Ultrasound of the inguinal floor for evaluation of hernias [^111Z8z5k]. Surgical Endoscopy (2002). Low credibility.

Background

This study aimed to evaluate the utility of ultrasound in the diagnosis of inguinal hernias and obscure groin pain.

Methods

A series of 65 consecutive groin explorations performed subsequently to percutaneous ultrasound examination were prospectively evaluated. Patients were examined in an office setting. The examination included a history and a physical. Then an ultrasound of the inguinal region was performed. Ultrasound was performed by the staff surgeon and fellows. Patients then were taken to surgery for either a laparoscopic or open hernia repair. The preoperative and operative findings were compared to determine the utility of groin ultrasound.

Results

A series of 41 patients presenting with symptoms of groin pain or palpable groin bulge were evaluated with ultrasound of the groin. Of these patients, 24 went on to have bilateral repairs, bringing the study total to 65 groins. Surgery involved 50 laparoscopic and 15 open hernia repairs. This included 20 groins without hernia, as determined by physical examination, and 45 groins with a palpable hernia. Overall, ultrasound was used to identify the type of hernia correctly (direct vs indirect) with 85% success. In the 20 patients who had no palpable bulge, ultrasound identified a protrusion (hernia or lipoma) in 17. Two of these were false positives, and the three negative ultrasound examinations were false negatives. Thus ultrasound identified the pathology in a groin without a palpable bulge at an accuracy of 75%. The overall accuracy in finding a hernia of any kind by ultrasound was 92%.

Conclusion

Ultrasound is a useful adjunct in evaluating the groin for hernia, and can be performed by surgeons.

### Vasitis: a rare diagnosis mimicking inguinal hernia: a case report [^111NzRCr]. BMC Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Clinical symptoms include localized pain or palpable mass in the scrotal or inguinal region, some of them with leukocytosis or fever. Acute vasitis could be classification as three groups depending on involved site: scrotal, suprascrotal, and prepubic. It can be easily confused when there is isolated site involvement. The common differential diagnoses include orchitis, epididymitis, testicular torsion, and inguinal hernia. Correct diagnosis is essential because the treatment of vasitis is via antibiotics, and operation is not required.

The diagnosis of vasitis could be a challenge by its rarity and unclear image findings. We review past reports that suggest appropriate tools include ultrasound, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Ultrasound can be used to exclude orchitis, epididymitis, and testicular torsion by color Doppler. Acute vasitis often reveals heterogeneous, hypoechoic spermatic cord and echogenic fat surrounding the lesions. However, ultrasound is relatively challenging to differentiate from incarcerated inguinal hernia to vasitis. CT and MRI are more recommended to confirm the diagnosis. Spiral CT has high resolution and short scanning time. Acute vasitis typically reveals unilateral edematous spermatic cord without evidence of herniated bowel loop. MRI can provide more soft tissue detail, abnormal signal intensities of inflamed or ischemic structures, with the additional benefits of no radiation exposure.

Based on the available literature, the majority of the reported vasitis can be resolved with the use of anti-inflammatories and antibiotics alone. Some authors prescribed oral antibiotics while others started with intravenous antibiotics in combination with oral antibiotics. A reported pediatric vasitis case suggested only partial regression of the inguinal swelling symptoms with 7 days of oral antibiotic use, and the patient was later admitted and treated successfully with intravenous antibiotics. Surgical exploration and drainage may be necessary in more severe cases that are not responsive to antibiotic treatment. En bloc excision of the vas deferens is uncommon and is usually performed for the exceptionally rare cases of Tuberculous vasitis. For our patient, we prescribed empirical antibiotic treatment with 500 mg of Levofloxacin once daily for two weeks. The patient's symptoms improved drastically upon the scheduled weekly follow-ups.

In summary, we present a rare case mimicking incarcerated inguinal hernia, and although vasitis is very rare, physicians should keep in mind that patients might present with similar symptoms, especially when the patient has risk factors such as previous vasectomy and concurrent leukocyturia. CT or MRI scan can play an important role to prevent unnecessary surgery.

A 77-year-old woman presented with a rare surgical phenomenon known as De Garengeot hernia. This unique presentation occurs due to the presence of a vermiform appendix in a femoral hernia sac. The patient presented with right-sided groin pain and a partially reducible hernia; she was otherwise haemodynamically stable and denied fevers, nausea and vomiting. The diagnosis was confirmed with CT which demonstrated a right-sided femoral hernia containing a perforated tip of the appendix. The patient urgently underwent an open appendectomy and open right femoral hernia repair using the modified McEvedy's incision.

### The tip of the iceberg: lipomatous tumours presenting as abdominal or pelvic wall hernias [^112aPNXn]. Insights Into Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Liposarcomas are the most common soft tissue sarcoma. They occur mainly in the thigh or retroperitoneum. Due to their size, lipomatous tumours can herniate either through the abdominal wall or in the groin. The part of the tumour that herniates represents only the 'tip of the iceberg', as the main part of the tumour is not detectable clinically and is often underestimated. Due to their deep location, lipomatous tumours are often large at the time of presentation and therefore their surgical management can be challenging. Furthermore, due to their delayed presentation, there is a higher risk of de-differentiation. In this pictorial review, we discuss different presentations of herniating lipomatous tumours according to the location of the abdominal wall defects. We aim to cover a wide spectrum of hernia defects including inguinal, ventral, lumbar, sciatic and ischiorectal hernias. We also present cases of tumours within the psoas compartment 'herniating' from the pelvis into the thigh. In case of a palpable lump, the first diagnostic step is to perform an ultrasound. If the herniating tissue is not fully accessible with ultrasound, additional cross-sectional imaging by CT or MRI is warranted. In this article, CT and MRI findings in lipomatous tumours are addressed and the use of contrast enhanced sequences in MRI is discussed. Patients' outcome depends not only on adequate diagnosis but also on the correct route of tissue sampling for histology and oncological resection to prevent local recurrence and loss of function. Therefore, referral to a specialised sarcoma treatment centre is key and needs to be done before biopsy.

### The tip of the iceberg: lipomatous tumours presenting as abdominal or pelvic wall hernias [^116eGgHc]. Insights Into Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this article, we have shown a wide range of lipomatous tumours in patients who presented with a palpable lesion herniating through a defect in the abdominal wall or extending in the psoas compartment.

In daily practice, this implies that however rare soft tissue sarcomas may be, the ultrasound assessment of an inguinal hernia or a quadriceps muscle strain can be the moment of detecting a sarcoma, i.e. this examination is often not performed by an MSK radiologist or in a tertiary referral centre.

We would like to summarise the take home messages for the encounter with these herniating lesions using the European Society of Musculoskeletal Radiology (ESSR) guidelines for soft tissue tumours for reference.

The first diagnostic step in the characterisation of a palpable soft tissue mass is an ultrasound. Ultrasound is mainly performed to exclude clearly benign lesions such as ganglions or other cystic lesions, bursas, small subcutaneous lipomas, palmar or plantar fibromas and neurofibromas.

When assessing a superficial lipomatous lesion, it should be homogeneous and well defined, encapsulated and compressible. When assessing a hernia with ultrasound, if the herniating tissue is not fully accessible, i.e. too large or the margins are not clearly visible, additional cross-sectional imaging by CT or MRI is warranted. For pelvic and retroperitoneal lesions, CT is the first step in further characterisation of the lesion.

Worrisome features for lipomatous tumours include size > 5 cm, nodularity which may represent a dedifferentiated area within the tumour, multiple septations or thickened septations within the lesion and deep location, i.e. below the superficial muscle fascia (intra- or inter-muscular, retroperitoneal). In addition, from our experience, haziness of the fat and oedema within the fatty tumour can point towards a malignant lesion.

### Positive predictive value of ultrasound in correctly identifying an inguinal hernia: a single-centered retrospective pilot study [^112SWyBd]. Insights Into Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

Recommendations

Our finding that some of the preoperative ultrasounds are FP for inguinal hernia in need of surgery, indicates the importance of detailed requests by GP's and surgeons for ultrasound examinations. The request should at least contain the indication of the ultrasound examination, BMI of the patient, symptoms and findings of the physical examination. In this way, the radiologist has more insight in the patient's history and factors that could potentially affect the accuracy of the ultrasound. Ideally, radiology reports should contain the following items by using a standard template: position of the patient during the ultrasound examination, use of Valsalva maneuver (positive or negative), mass and size of the inguinal hernia, epigastric veins (identified or not identified), the contents of the hernia sac, reducibility and possible limitations of the examination due to scanning conditions. A more detailed radiology report is especially important in case of an inconclusive ultrasound examination.

When the anamnesis and physical examination are inconclusive and the ultrasound positive but factors associated with FP ultrasound results such as BMI are present, the surgeon may consider using additional diagnostic imaging like an MRI or CT scan as recommended by current guidelines. For an accurate physical and/or ultrasound examination, it is important to examine the patient both in a standing and supine position, considering that the hernia in some cases can only be seen in a certain position or only with the Valsalva maneuver.

An MRI or CT scan with and without Valsalva maneuver is not operator dependent and may provide more certainty about the diagnosis. In their systematic review, Piga et al. reported that MRI showed promising results and seems to be a better alternative than CT. However, it is important to note that not enough patients could be included in their study to draw strong conclusions.

### Mind the gap: imaging spectrum of abdominal ventral hernia repair complications [^113629ei]. Insights Into Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Ultrasound also shows variable appearance (Fig. 4) and presence of fluid around generally enhances its echogenicity and plays an important role in diagnosing mesh migration and infection. The study and modality selection hence must be tailored according to the clinical presentation with an ability to complement with an additional modality.
Seroma: Seroma cannot be considered as a complication as it is a normal occurrence and is secondary to fluid collection comprising of blood and lymph due to dissection of tissue planes especially in laparoscopic approach. The size of the seroma is proportionate to the amount of dissection. Resolution occurs in 95% cases. Rana et al. reported seroma incidence of 44% in their study where hernioplasty with onlay technique was used. Seroma is complicated if it persists more than 6 weeks, is symptomatic, or increasing in size. It is important to distinguish between seroma and an infected collection as the latter requires drainage and specific antibiotic therapy. Imaging depicts seroma as a well/ill-defined collection within the dead space. Wall is thin or imperceptible with no or minimal enhancement. Usually, the collection is anterior to the mesh. Fat lobules can be seen within the seroma (Fig. 5). Infected seromas show thick, vascularized wall with exudative content and may be accompanied by signs and symptoms of inflammation. A diagnostic aspiration is helpful to identify the organism and provide antibiotic sensitivity profile.
Hematoma: Hematomas usually resolve and are dependent on surgical technique. They are seen as ill-defined heteroechoic collections on USG or hyperdense on plain CT (Fig. 6). Rarely, they expand if there is active ooze which can be picked on contrast CT. Spermatic cord hematomas are common with inguinal hernia repairs and usually resolve.
Adhesions: Adhesions can occur with any intraabdominal surgery and are the most common cause of small bowel obstruction in a postoperative abdomen. Use of composite mesh has shown to reduce the adhesions as well aiding in better meshoma formation. On imaging, clues to adhesion-related obstruction include clumping of loops, adhesion of bowel to anterior abdominal wall, visualization of fat containing band, and acute angulation of loops at the site of transition (Fig. 7).
Infection: Incidence of infection in post hernia repair is highly variable (0–36%) and is dependent on many factors. Common causative organisms include Staphylococcus (esp Methicillin resistant), Streptococcus, Escherichia coli, and anaerobic bacteria. Unique organism associated with implant infection include nontuberculous Mycobacterium which is seen in developing countries. Repair of complex hernias, hernias containing bowel and requiring bowel anastomosis, parastomal hernias, longer surgical time, equipment sterility, and impeded patient immune response have higher risk of infection. Microporous and multifilament mesh have higher predisposal to infection. Mesh infection is generally managed by systemic antibiotics, drainage in case of abscess, and removal of mesh if deep infection is suspected. Removal of mesh is followed by resuturing/placement of biodegradable mesh which incite less tissue reaction. Infection can predispose to sinus formation, mesh migration, and erosion into viscera. Imaging helps in delineating the extent of infection and associated visceral involvement (Figs. 8 and 9).

### Watchful waiting versus totally extraperitoneal (TEP) hernia repair for occult inguinal hernia and pain (EFFECT trial)-a multicenter, non-inferiority, randomized controlled trial [^113GNuQk]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Groin pain in adults is a frequent complaint encountered in surgical practice and is often associated with inguinal hernias. However, the diagnosis and treatment of patients presenting with groin pain in the absence of clinical signs of an inguinal hernia can be challenging. Current international guidelines advise further investigation in these patients using ultrasonography and, if inconclusive, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). When additional imaging reveals an inguinal hernia that is not detectable by physical examination, this is referred to as occult. To date, no standardized therapeutic guidelines have been established for occult inguinal hernias accompanied by groin pain. In clinical practice, this diagnosis often results in surgical treatment; however, there is a lack of evidence to support this decision.

Few studies have reported the prevalence of occult inguinal hernias without any related symptoms. One study observed a prevalence of 16% for occult inguinal hernias when groin ultrasonography was conducted in 100 healthy males. Although contralateral exploration during unilateral laparoendoscopic inguinal hernia repair remains controversial, the HerniaSurge Group International Guidelines for Groin Hernia Management report that the prevelance of occult inguinal hernias ranges from 5 to 58% during this procedure. However, the prevelance of occult inguinal hernias and associated groin pain remains unknown.

It is important to recognize that an occult inguinal hernia may not be the true origin of inguinal pain and could merely represent an incidental finding alongside an alternative diagnosis. First, the accuracy of ultrasound is reduced if no palpable hernia is present. Second, given the positive predictive value (PPV) of 70% for ultrasound in detecting occult inguinal hernias, there is a high chance of negative groin exploration, indicating that radiologic findings may not always be accurate. Therefore, it is likely that in some cases, complaints persist or even increase after surgical management. Conversely, delaying treatment could lead to prolonged suffering.

At present, knowledge regarding the optimal treatment strategy for patients with groin pain and diagnosis of an occult inguinal hernia is insufficient and may result in unnecessary surgical interventions and inadequate patient counseling. To answer this question, a multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT), the EFFECT trial, was conducted to compare pain levels and quality of life (QoL) between a watchful waiting (WW) approach and totally extraperitoneal (TEP) repair in this specific patient population. The trial hypothesizes that WW is non-inferior to TEP repair for patients with inguinal pain and an occult inguinal hernia.

### Point-of care ultrasound in stratifying clinically evolving inguinal and femoral hernias [^111d3DtM]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) is an optimal imaging modality for the risk stratification of patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with inguinal and femoral hernias, allowing for better evaluation of clinical presentations and guiding appropriate treatment. The lack of ultrasound classification for inguinal and femoral hernias has led to inconsistent use and often underuse of POCUS in this patient population. Several groin hernia classifications are available, but most are complex and often targeted toward surgical management.

Objectives

The objective of this study is to review the use of POCUS in the diagnosis of inguinal and femoral hernias, providing a synopsis of critical ultrasound findings in determining signs of incarceration, strangulation, and small bowel obstruction, and suggesting a simple and educative sonographic classification for inguinal or femoral hernias.

Discussion

POCUS can reliably confirm the presence of groin hernias and can uniquely identify specific ultrasound findings predictive of complications, such as aperistaltic nonreducible bowel loops, free fluid in the hernia sac, and lack of color doppler in the entrapped mesentery and bowel walls. POCUS can also aid in determining the presence of small bowel obstruction by detecting dilated loops of bowel > 25 mm adjacent and proximal to the hernia site.

Conclusions

In the ED, POCUS can confirm the presence of a hernia sac and identify and predict surgical emergencies, such as bowel incarceration or strangulation, which are the most important elements in the management of patients presenting with possible inguinal or femoral hernias.

### Vasitis: a rare diagnosis mimicking inguinal hernia: a case report [^116ueFeL]. BMC Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Vasitis or inflammation of the vas deferens is a rare condition, and few case reports with computed tomography images have been published since 1980.

Case Presentation

A 50-year-old man presented with severe right inguinal and lower abdominal pain. Initial diagnosis at the emergency department was incarcerated or strangulated inguinal hernia. The computed tomography scan revealed diffuse edematous changes of right spermatic cord and vas deferens with peripheral fat stranding. Correlating with his clinical symptoms, signs, and imaging findings, the diagnosis of vasitis was made. We report a case of acute vasitis about the cause, symptom, pathogen, differential diagnoses, image findings, and treatment.

Conclusion

Although very rare, vasitis should be listed as one of the differential diagnosis for inguinal mass lesions. Cross-sectional imaging may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and exclude differentials such as an inguinal hernia. Recognition of the characteristic image findings can help to make the correct diagnosis and avoid unnecessary surgery.

### Urinary bladder diverticulum as a content of femoral hernia: a case report and review of literature [^116giiFc]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Groin hernia is a common surgical disease and its content is usually intra-abdominal viscera surrounded by the peritoneum. An extra peritoneal organ cannot be contained in the sac of the hernia. However, it can be pulled by the sac itself and becomes a component of the hernia as in the case of a bladder diverticulum.

Femoral hernias are less common than inguinal hernias and are usually complicated with incarceration or strangulation of the organ that they contain. Bladder diverticula arise within a trabeculated high pressure urinary bladder caused by bladder outlet obstruction. In most cases, it is a result of benign prostatic hypertrophy. As the clinical features of the bladder diverticulum are not specific, high index of suspicion along with proper imaging studies are of great help in making a timely diagnosis.

We present a case of a huge urinary bladder diverticulum that herniated into the right femoral canal in association with indirect reducible right inguinal hernia.

Case report

A 59-year old obese man presented to the emergency department with a long standing history of lower urinary tract symptoms and a subsequent appearance of a right groin swelling of nine months duration. His symptoms of difficulty of urination, increased urinary frequency, nocturia and urgency became worse when the groin swelling increased in size. The patient used to reduce the swelling manually to improve the symptoms. Six hours prior to the emergency room visit, the pain became intolerable and the swelling was tender and irreducible. The patient has essential hypertension and benign prostatic hypertrophy for the last 5 years.

Physical examination revealed that the patient had stable vital signs and controlled blood pressure. Body mass index (BMI) was 32 kg/m2. Abdominal examination showed the presence of a tender right groin swelling which was difficult to assess because of tenderness and obesity. Digital rectal examination showed a clinically benign enlarged prostate about 80 grams in volume.

### Imaging of groin masses: inguinal anatomy and pathologic conditions revisited [^113ohymS]. Radiographics (2001). Low credibility.

The groin region is subdivided into two distinct anatomic areas: the inguinal canal and the femoral triangle. A series of cross-sectional imaging cases illustrate that a good understanding of the local anatomic characteristics of the groin allows confident characterization of groin pathologic conditions. Such conditions can be classified into five major groups: congenital abnormalities, noncongenital hernias, vascular conditions, infectious or inflammatory processes, and neoplasms. Congenital entities include hernias, cysts, undescended testis, and retractile testes. Ultrasound (US) is useful in depicting these conditions. In the second group, noncongenital hernias, US allows visualization of bowel loops in peristalsis within the hernia. Herniography, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging are also helpful in diagnosis. Among vascular conditions, false aneurysms may be detected from the turbulent flow through the tract at Doppler US. The characteristic venous flow of varicoceles is best diagnosed with US during the Valsalva maneuver. Infectious or inflammatory conditions include, among others, hematomas, which appear hyperattenuating at CT and have variable appearances, depending on the age of the blood products, at MR imaging. The origins of neoplasms may be assessed at CT and MR imaging, although appearances of solid tumors are relatively nonspecific.

### Vasitis: a rare diagnosis mimicking inguinal hernia: a case report [^115qyZem]. BMC Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute vasitis or inflammation of the vas deferens is an extremely rare disease, with only about twenty adult case reports published since 1980. Few of these contain computed tomography (CT) images. Clinically, it presents with nonspecific symptoms of inguinal swelling and local pain that can mimic orchitis, epididymitis, testicular torsion, and inguinal hernia. Familiarity with symptoms, image findings, and differential diagnoses is essential to prevent unnecessary surgery, especially when symptoms mimic an inguinal hernia.

### Positive predictive value of ultrasound in correctly identifying an inguinal hernia: a single-centered retrospective pilot study [^113sx8bZ]. Insights Into Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Inguinal hernia surgery is one of the most commonly performed surgical procedures worldwide. According to the national guidelines published in 2020, approximately 27,000 inguinal hernia surgeries are performed annually in the Netherlands (national guideline, 2020), of which 500 to 800 surgeries are performed in our hospital. In 95% of patients with suspected inguinal hernia, the general practitioner (GP) or surgeon can diagnose the inguinal hernia based on the clinical presentation and physical examination. When the physical examination is inconclusive, ultrasonography is indicated according to both the international and Dutch inguinal hernia guidelines. Typical findings of a hernia on ultrasound consist of a hernial sac containing adipose or intestinal tissue or protrusion of a herniating sac when the Valsalva maneuver is performed.

Several studies compared the role of ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and/or computed tomography (CT) in the diagnosis of inguinal hernias. In a recent systematic review (2020), Piga et al. aimed to determine which diagnostic modality is the most accurate in diagnosing inguinal hernia. They concluded that ultrasound has the highest sensitivity and specificity compared to CT and/or MRI. The sensitivity and specificity of ultrasound for diagnosing inguinal hernias were 56–100% and 0–100%, respectively, whereas the sensitivity and specificity of CT scans ranged from 48 to 98% and 25 to 100%, respectively, and of MRI from 85 to 95% and 90 to 100%, respectively. In spite of the broader range in sensitivity and specificity observed, on average ultrasonography performed the best.

In a systematic review by Kwee et al. the positive predictive value (PPV) of ultrasonography for inguinal hernias was evaluated. In the 16 studies included, the PPV ranged from 58.8 to 100%. A pooled PPV of 86.4% (CI 95% [78.9–92.4]) was reported. These findings showed that PPVs are inconsistent and vary significantly between studies. Thus, additional research is warranted. Moreover, it is currently unclear which factors are associated with false positive (FP) ultrasound findings, although operator experience has already been linked to ultrasound accuracy.

A prior clinical diagnosis of hernia may explain part of the FP diagnoses, especially when there is no evident clinical sign like palpable sac or swelling. In case of inguinal pain without swelling, diagnosing hernia may be very difficult even for a trained surgeon, GP and ultrasound technician.

### De garengeot hernia: the ultrasound and computed tomographic findings in an 81-year-old woman [^111PCpaF]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

The presence of appendix within a femoral hernia is a rare condition in an incarcerated femoral hernia. It has a characteristic groin mass, and the diagnosis of appendicitis is mainly made intraoperatively. A specific imaging appearance (ultrasonography, computed tomography [CT]) allows accurate prospective diagnosis. The recognition of this rare femoral hernia helps us to choose appropriate therapeutic approach. We report a case of an 81-year-old woman who present with painful and nonreducible groin mass. The ultrasonography and CT characteristic imaging features successfully diagnosed de Garengeot hernia. To our knowledge, this is the first description of a combination of CT and ultrasound in the preoperative diagnosis.

### Acute appendicitis in a femoral hernia: an unusual presentation of a groin mass [^113o756n]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Although most groin masses are simple hernias, occasionally these hernias contain more than just small intestine. Femoral hernias, which are less common than inguinal, are more often found in females. Stomach, omentum, colon, or an appendix each has been reported to be contained in a femoral hernia. Having an acutely inflamed appendix contained in a femoral hernia sac in a male is extraordinarily rare. We report a case of acute appendicitis contained in a femoral hernia of a 76 year old man. This entity presents much like an incarcerated hernia, and differentiating the two can lead to changes in the surgical management.

Endometriosis is a common clinical presentation for gynaecologists. Occasionally it can present to general surgeons as a swelling in the groin or abdominal wall. This condition should be included in the differential diagnosis in female patients. A 32-year-old woman with a 2-year history of a painful persistent lump in her right groin was referred to the general surgeons by her general practitioner. She was referred with a diagnosis of a suspected inguinal hernia. MRI excluded a hernia and exploration of the groin and subsequent histology confirmed the lesion to be an endometrial deposit.

### Spermatocytic tumor coexisting with a contralateral inguinoscrotal undifferentiated sarcoma: a case report [^114hEg16]. BMC Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Case report

Patient information

A 77-year-old male patient presented with a painless right inguinal swelling over two weeks, initially suspected to indicate inguinoscrotal hernia, and a painless solid mass in his left scrotum, discovered by the physician during clinical examination. There was no positive family history of tumor disease. The patient's medical history revealed prostatic bladder dysfunction, treated by transurethral prostate resection a few months prior, as well as an unremarkable prostate cancer screening.

Clinical findings

Physical examination revealed firm nodular structures on an enlarged, non-tender left testis. No inguinoscrotal hernia was palpable on the left side. A mobile, partially reducible inguinoscrotal mass with a smooth surface was palpated on the right side, showing no erythema and no tenderness. No suspicious lymph nodes were detected during examination. B-symptoms were absent.

Diagnostic assessment

Laboratory values

Testicular cancer markers indicated slightly elevated alpha-1-fetoprotein (AFP) 10 IU/mL (reference < 8 IU/mL), beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (bHCG) 1 mU/mL (reference < 5 mU/mL) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 158 U/L (reference < 220 U/L) within normal levels.

Imaging

Ultrasound revealed a diffusely enlarged left testis with heterogeneous parenchyma, highly suspicious for testicular cancer (Fig. 1 a). On the right side, a hypoechoic mass measuring up to 14 cm was delineated, potentially indicative of an inguinoscrotal hernia. The right testis appeared homogeneous with regular perfusion. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the thorax and abdomen was performed for staging purposes. The CT revealed no evidence of local or distant metastases. The right-sided groin mass was not suspected to be malignant and the diagnosis of an inguinoscrotal hernia remained the most likely. Therefore, no further diagnostic investigation was initiated.

### Spigelian hernia and cryptorchidism syndrome: open spigelian hernia repair and laparoscopic one-stage orchiopexy for ectopic testis [^112pesWq]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Investigations

The patient had a preoperative ultrasound performed during the ED visit. The ultrasound noted a left inguinal hernia containing fluid and nonobstructive bowel. The fascial defect measured up to 1.3 cm. The hernia sac measured approximately 4.0×1.4×5.3 cm. Vascularity was noted within the herniated bowel on Doppler imaging, and no bowel wall thickening was visible. The hernia was not reducible during the study. The left testicle was visible inferior to the hernia sac within the inguinal canal (figure 1). No mass, fluid collection or adenopathy was seen. This study impacted the initial evaluation of the primary surgeon by introducing an element of premature diagnostic closure. No alternatives to a typical indirect left inguinal hernia with an undescended testicle were considered. The findings on the original exam were supported by the ultrasound, but the findings on the second exam were not, prompting a reconsideration of the differential diagnosis of the patient. The patient had a normal complete blood count including normal platelets, prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time.
