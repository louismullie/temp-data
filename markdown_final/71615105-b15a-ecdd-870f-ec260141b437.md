## Question

Process of clearing patient for surgery as a primary care provider

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the process of clearing a patient for surgery as a primary care provider. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the foundational principle that we do not "clear" patients but rather optimize and risk-stratify them. Then, I should verify the timing and scope of the preoperative evaluation. Next, I will review the core elements of history, exam, and targeted testing. After that, I need to check condition-specific optimizations and when to involve specialists. I will then examine documentation, communication, and coordination with surgical teams. Finally, I should consider special populations, postoperative follow-up, and how to integrate evolving tools and pathways into practice [^ba6e59e3] [^bf1c2733].

> Let me first confirm the foundational principle: primary care "clearance" is a misnomer; the correct approach is preoperative evaluation and optimization to reduce perioperative risk, not binary approval, and this should be done early enough to allow meaningful intervention, ideally several weeks before surgery when feasible [^ba6e59e3] [^bf1c2733].

> I need to ensure the timing is appropriate. Wait, let me verify the lead time: many programs still schedule preassessment only 1–2 weeks before surgery, which is often too late for high-risk patients; early evaluation enables modifiable risk reduction such as anemia correction, glycemic optimization, smoking cessation, and medication reconciliation, and this is especially critical for older or multimorbid patients [^13acaf14] [^bf1c2733].

> Next, I should review the core elements of the preoperative history and exam. I will now examine the essentials: confirm the surgical indication and planned procedure, document prior surgeries and anesthesia reactions, assess functional capacity using METs when relevant, screen for cardiopulmonary disease, diabetes, renal disease, liver disease, and frailty, and perform a medication reconciliation with attention to anticoagulants, antiplatelets, and perioperative holds; I should double-check that functional capacity ≥ 4 METs without symptoms supports proceeding without further cardiac testing in many noncardiac surgeries, per ACC/AHA guidance [^cc183c37] [^d5e38461].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about universal testing; I should confirm a targeted approach. Routine labs are not needed for all; order CBC to screen for anemia, BMP or CMP for renal/hepatic function when indicated, HbA1c for diabetics, and ECG or further cardiac testing based on age, comorbidities, and functional status using the ACC/AHA algorithm; for example, patients with ≥ 3 clinical risk factors or poor functional capacity warrant noninvasive cardiac testing if it will change management, whereas those with good functional capacity and no active cardiac conditions can proceed without further testing [^cc183c37] [^d5e38461].

> I will now examine condition-specific optimizations that meaningfully change outcomes. Let me think about anemia: preoperative anemia increases transfusion and complications; detect and treat with iron (oral or IV) or erythropoietin when indicated, and coordinate with the surgical team on transfusion thresholds. For diabetes, target HbA1c < 7.5% when feasible to reduce infection risk. For smoking, aim for at least 4–8 weeks of cessation when possible. For frailty or geriatric patients, incorporate geriatric assessment and address cognition, falls, and polypharmacy. For opioid use disorder or chronic opioids, plan a perioperative taper and coordinate with anesthesia/pain services to avoid withdrawal and uncontrolled pain [^52856312] [^3702928f] [^c46046c5] [^20b145c6] [^cbac9d96].

> But wait, what if the patient is high risk or the surgery is complex? I should confirm when to involve specialists. Cardiology input is indicated for active cardiac conditions, poor functional capacity with multiple risk factors, or when noninvasive testing is abnormal. Pulmonology for uncontrolled COPD or asthma. Endocrinology for brittle diabetes. Nephrology for eGFR < 30 or dialysis. Pain management for complex opioid regimens. Geriatrics for frailty or advanced age. The threshold should be lower when the surgical risk is high or when optimization could materially change outcomes [^cc183c37] [^d5e38461].

> Next, I should review documentation and communication. I need to ensure the referral packet includes a concise problem list, medication reconciliation with perioperative plans, relevant labs and imaging, and a summary of optimizations completed or pending. Crucially, I should communicate patient goals and preferences, advance directives, and functional status so the surgical team can align care plans; I should double-check that EMR limitations often obscure goals, so a dedicated note or summary highlighting what matters most to the patient is helpful [^2ad84c50] [^b6d6cd91].

> Hold on, I should verify coordination with surgical teams and anesthesia. Preassessment clinics can streamline this, and in some systems, dedicated PASS clinics achieve comparable or better outcomes than PCP-only clearance while improving efficiency; regardless of pathway, I should confirm receipt of the referral, clarify who will manage perioperative medications, and ensure a plan for postoperative follow-up and pain management, especially for patients with multimorbidity or opioid exposure [^704b63b9] [^ded79151] [^13acaf14].

> I will now examine special populations. For older adults, I should apply the geriatric framework: conduct a risk–benefit analysis of surgery, elicit and communicate goals, prepare the patient and family for consultation, set realistic expectations about recovery, assist with decision-making, advocate for the patient, and coordinate postoperative care; I need to ensure advance care planning is updated and that discharge planning considers home services, rehab, or skilled care when indicated [^0b943aaa] [^69accc5d]. For pediatrics, I should confirm immunizations, growth and developmental context, and family support, and coordinate with pediatric anesthesia and surgery teams; for neurodivergent patients, anticipate sensory needs, provide concrete stepwise instructions, and involve caregivers in preparation and advocacy [^aba63a39] [^a9bc7b48]. For patients with obesity, screen for obstructive sleep apnea, diabetes, and hypertension, and consider referral to bariatric or weight management programs when appropriate [^notfound].

> Next, I should review postoperative follow-up and transitions. Early PCP follow-up within 30 days, especially within 2 weeks for high-risk patients, is associated with lower 30-day readmissions; I should confirm that discharge summaries specify medication reconciliation, wound care, red flags, and who to contact for issues, and I should proactively schedule the PCP visit and reconcile opioids or other high-risk medications to prevent adverse events [^4f58437f] [^d4e98c3a].

> Let me consider evolving tools and system supports. Digital decision support can improve adherence to guideline-based testing and reduce unnecessary evaluations, though I should verify that local implementation preserves clinical judgment for edge cases. Shared care protocols and standardized handoffs can reduce fragmentation, and embedding prehabilitation, nutrition, and smoking cessation earlier in the pathway can yield dividends in recovery and cost [^29a1fa60] [^2ce6e902] [^bf1c2733].

> In summary, I need to ensure my approach remains patient-centered, risk-adapted, and coordinated: start early, target testing and optimization to modifiable risks, communicate goals and plans clearly across teams, and arrange timely postoperative follow-up. If I catch myself saying "clear for surgery", I should correct that framing to "optimized and risk-stratified for surgery", because that is the work that actually improves outcomes [^ba6e59e3] [^bf1c2733].

Primary care "clearance" for surgery is a **risk assessment and optimization process** [^ba6e59e3] — not a blanket approval — that identifies, quantifies, and mitigates modifiable risks to reduce perioperative complications and cancellations [^bf1c2733]. The PCP's role is to **coordinate preoperative care** by conducting a focused history and exam, ordering selective tests based on risk and procedure, optimizing chronic conditions, and communicating with the surgical team and patient to align care with goals and logistics [^1bf5657b] [^2ad84f50]. This approach is supported by guidelines and evidence showing that targeted preoperative evaluation improves outcomes and efficiency [^d5e38461] [^704b63b9].

---

## Preoperative evaluation process

### Initial patient assessment

- **History and physical examination**: Document comorbidities, medications, allergies, prior surgeries/anesthesia, and functional status; assess cardiopulmonary, renal, hepatic, endocrine, and neurologic systems [^ba6e59e3].

- **Functional capacity assessment**: Use METs to gauge risk; ≥ 4 METs without symptoms supports proceeding without further cardiac testing in many cases [^cc183c37].

- **Medication reconciliation**: Review and adjust medications that increase perioperative risk (e.g. anticoagulants, antihypertensives, diabetes drugs) per procedure and timing [^20b145c6].

---

### Risk stratification and selective testing

Risk stratification guides testing: **low-risk patients** generally need minimal testing, whereas **high-risk patients** require targeted evaluations (e.g. ECG, labs, cardiopulmonary testing) based on comorbidities and procedure risk [^d5e38461]. Routine testing without indication is discouraged, as it can cause harm and delays [^1bf5657b].

| **Risk category** | **Recommended tests** |
|-|-|
| Low risk | - Minimal testing <br/> - Focused history and exam [^d5e38461] |
| Intermediate risk | - ECG <br/> - Basic labs (CBC, BMP, glucose) <br/> - Consider chest X-ray if cardiopulmonary disease [^d5e38461] |
| High risk | - Comprehensive labs <br/> - ECG <br/> - Echocardiography <br/> - Stress testing <br/> - Pulmonary function tests <br/> - Specialist consultations as indicated [^d5e38461] |

---

### Optimization of chronic conditions

- **Cardiovascular disease**: Optimize blood pressure, heart failure, and arrhythmias; manage anticoagulation per procedure [^d5e38461].

- **Diabetes mellitus**: Target HbA1c < 7.5% and perioperative glucose 80–180 mg/dL to reduce infection and complications [^3702928f].

- **Respiratory disease**: Treat exacerbations, optimize inhalers, and provide smoking cessation support [^c46046c5].

- **Renal and hepatic disease**: Adjust medications, correct electrolytes, and coordinate dialysis timing [^notfound].

---

### Communication and coordination

Clear communication with the surgical team should include **medical history, medications, and optimization status** [^2ad84f50]. Patient education should explain preoperative instructions, risks, and expectations, and advance care planning should document goals, advance directives, and surrogates [^20b145c6].

---

## Documentation and communication

Documentation should include a **concise medical summary, risk assessment, and optimization plan** [^ba6e59e3]. Communication with the surgical team should be direct, and the patient should receive written instructions and emergency contacts [^4a84d41e].

---

## Special considerations

- **Geriatric patients**: Emphasize frailty, cognition, falls, and functional status; use geriatric-specific tools and involve caregivers [^d5e38461].

- **Pediatric patients**: Include growth, development, immunizations, and family support; coordinate with pediatric teams [^aba63a39].

- **Patients with disabilities**: Accommodate communication, mobility, and sensory needs; coordinate supports [^a9bc7b48].

---

## Postoperative follow-up

Arrange **early PCP follow-up** within 2–4 weeks to monitor recovery, manage complications, and reconcile medications; coordinate with surgery teams for persistent issues [^4f58437f].

---

Primary care "clearance" is a **targeted, risk-based optimization** that reduces complications and cancellations while aligning care with patient goals and procedural needs [^bf1c2733].

### Patient risk screening to improve transitions of care in surgical opioid prescribing: a qualitative study of provider perspectives [^cbac9d96]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Resources needed and ideal practices to address opioid risk

Multiple providers suggested streamlining perioperative opioid management with a clear pathway. In anesthesia, participants recommended a perioperative pain clinic staffed with a team whose specific role would be to follow patients both preoperatively and postoperatively. When describing this perioperative clinic, anesthesia providers placed value on administrative and nurse staffing support. Similarly, a primary care provider described the need for a robust pain management clinic staffed with providers trained in the complex management OUD and chronic pain. Three surgeons cited needs specific to patient screening. They recommended a systematic preoperative screening process that does not rely on surgeons, identifies patients with low pain thresholds and provides clarity on specific thresholds warranting preoperative inpatient treatment to taper or stabilize opioids. Multiple providers expressed that while a screening tool may be helpful in identifying patients at risk, the question of how to manage these patients would remain a challenge. Four participants noted needs related to clarifying and standardizing pain management, such as clarity about who to contact, standardized protocols for peri-operative pain management, and standard and dedicated post-operative pain management supports and services. The need for ideal practices to be standardized is exemplified by the quote:

My experience with opioid legislation tells me we need to hardwire this. It needs to be, so you take the human element out and there’s just no other way to do business. And so ordered steps need to be locked down. And we need guardrails in place that make it impossible to do the wrong thing… We can make a clinic, have a great plan, but at the end of the day it can all be undone by one team member who just goes about it their own way. (Participant 19, Anesthesiology)

When further describing the need for increased perioperative management with a dedicated clinic, providers described a clinic with (1) ample providers with relevant expertize, (2) sufficient administrative support, (3) longitudinal care, (4) an approach informed by history of trauma, (5) improved access, and (6) a focus on patient education, as modeled in figure 2.

Preparing for transitions

Providing a separate information sheet or a personalized book with information about the surgery, anesthesia, and contact details for the preoperative clinic/team can help reduce anxiety and confusion when preparing ND patients for transitions in the perioperative setting.The care team should provide clear, step-by-step, concrete instructions regarding the preoperative process, including changes in the environment, routines, and personnel involved. Proactively inquiring about the patient's need for accommodations, emphasizing the care team's willingness to answer questions, and actively encouraging patients and caretakers to express inquiries allow for targeted adjustments and foster open communication with the medical team. A familiar support person plays a vital role in the preparation, continuity of care, emotional support, communication, and advocacy for the patient.

Involving multidisciplinary assessments

The collaborative involvement of a multidisciplinary team, including anesthesiologists, psychologists, psychiatrists, child life specialists, caregivers, and other medical specialties, is vital for comprehensive preoperative evaluation tailored to each ND patient. The combined expertise offers insights into cognitive, behavioral, and medical aspects, ensuring a thorough medical history review and understanding of specific conditions. Where applicable, collaboration with the patient's primary healthcare provider and caretaker is important to understand their medical requirements and developmental history.

### A framework to optimize primary care of older surgical patients: a qualitative study of geriatricians [^b6d6cd91]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

In this qualitative study of geriatricians, we presented novel findings on the actions geriatricians take to support older patients considering surgery. Navigating older patients through surgery is complex and requires that geriatricians provide support to patients and their families through a multipronged approach that has not been well delineated in the literature. Current guidelines comment on medical optimization, perioperative medical management, and the importance of advance care planning but fall short in describing all of the actions required from a primary care perspective to optimize care of older patients requiring surgery. Drawing on the expertise of geriatricians who navigate this process frequently, we present the first comprehensive framework that primary care clinicians may reference in this setting to tailor their practice to meet the needs of older patients.

It is important to note that this framework reflects the significant work that is performed by geriatricians and primary care clinicians to add value to the care of older and frail adults. This work ensures that surgical care is safe and effective as well as centered on patient goals. However, despite clear benefits to patients and the health care system, the identified work of geriatricians in this study is largely uncompensated and time intensive. Previous studies have shown that financial incentives for primary care clinicians targeting specific areas of primary care have led to improvements in health care quality.Therefore, we advocate for the development of incentive systems that will adequately reimburse primary care clinicians for doing this critical work.

A key finding that emerged from this work is the identification of multiple barriers encountered by geriatricians when supporting older adults undergoing surgical consultation and in the perioperative period. For example, geriatricians identify one of their key roles as eliciting and communicating patient goals so that they are well aligned with clinical care decisions. Geriatricians feel that the EMR is limited in capturing and conveying patient goals. These findings are supported by previous studies that have shown that primary care clinicians desire standardized workflows within the EMR for documenting advanced care planning discussions.This presents an area where health care systems could support primary care clinicians in caring for older patients.

Another area where geriatricians encounter barriers is in their communication with the surgical team in the preoperative and postoperative setting. Prior research has shown gaps in communication between primary care clinicians and surgical teams during the referral process and transitions of care. Evidence-based interventions that may improve these communication challenges include use of nurse care coordinators, adoption of health information technology, and ensuring that primary care clinicians have adequate time per patient visit.

### Factors associated with primary care physician decision-making when making medication recommendations vs surgical referrals [^d4fb14c0]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Primary care physicians (PCPs) initiate more than 51 million referrals annually.With substantial differences in practice patterns, management of the referral process is critical to facilitate advances in patient satisfaction, population health, and cost containment.

Given the variation in quality across surgeons and hospitals in the US, referrals for high-quality surgical care provide an opportunity to improve patient care.Although data on surgeon and hospital performance are publicly available for clinicians at the time of referral decisions, it is not clear if and how such data are applied.

In an effort to identify a new mechanism to promote high-quality surgical care, we sought to understand how PCPs select specific surgeons and hospitals for referrals. We conducted a qualitative content analysis of qualitative interviews with PCPs to compare the information used to make medication prescription recommendations vs referrals to specific surgeons or hospitals. We hypothesized that PCPs could approach direct referrals to surgical care with a similar evidence-based method as other medical treatment decisions.

### Care of the patient with primary open-angle glaucoma [^51748570]. AOA (2010). Medium credibility.

Evidence-based clinical guidelines—definitions and trustworthiness criteria are outlined, emphasizing that evidence-based clinical practice guidelines provide for the use of current best evidence in conjunction with clinical expertise and patient values to guide health care decisions. In Clinical Practice Guidelines We Can Trust, clinical practice guidelines are defined as statements that include recommendations intended to optimize patient care that are informed by a systematic review of the evidence and an assessment of the benefits and harms of alternative care options. The report states that to be trustworthy, guidelines should be based on a systematic review of existing evidence, be developed by a knowledgeable, multidisciplinary panel of experts and key stakeholders, consider important patient subgroups and preferences, as appropriate, be based on a transparent process that minimizes conflicts of interest and biases, provide a clear explanation of the logical relationships between alternative care options and health outcomes, provide a grading of both the quality of evidence and the strength of the clinical recommendation, and be revised as appropriate when new evidence warrants modifications of recommendations. Based on the IOM/NASEM reports, the AOA Evidence-based Optometry (EBO) Committee developed a 14-step process to meet the new evidence-based recommendations for trustworthy guidelines.

### A framework to optimize primary care of older surgical patients: a qualitative study of geriatricians [^411526bb]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

How can older adults be optimally supported during the surgical care process by primary care clinicians?

Findings

This qualitative study of semistructured interviews with 24 geriatricians identified 7 actions that geriatricians undertake in addition to routine preoperative optimization: conduct risk-benefit analysis of surgical referral, elicit and communicate patient goals, prepare patient and family for surgical consultation, set realistic expectations, assist with decision about surgery, advocate for patient and family, and coordinate postoperative care.

Meaning

Our findings establish a comprehensive framework that primary care clinicians may reference when caring for older patients who may require elective surgery.

### Preoperative evaluation-AAFP (...) [^ba6e59e3]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

The purpose of a preoperative evaluation is not to “clear” patients for elective surgery, but rather to evaluate and, if necessary, implement measures to prepare higher risk patients for surgery. Pre-operative outpatient medical evaluation can decrease the length of hospital stay as well as minimize postponed or cancelled surgeries. 1 To effectively provide this consultative service, the physician should understand the risk associated with the particular type of surgery planned and relate this risk to the patient's underlying acute and chronic medical problems. The complete consultation should include recommendations for evaluation and treatment, including prophylactic therapies to minimize the perioperative risk. Preoperative History and Physical Examination The patient should ideally be evaluated several weeks before the operation.

The history should include information about the condition for which the surgery is planned, any past surgical procedures and the patient's experience with anesthesia. In children, the history should also include birth history, focusing on risk factors such as prematurity at birth, perinatal complications and congenital chromosomal or anatomic malformations, and history of recent infections, particularly upper respiratory infections or pneumonia. Immunization status can be documented, and vaccines can be updated if necessary. The patient should be asked about smoking history and alcohol and drug use. Ideally, the patient should quit smoking eight or more weeks before surgery to minimize the surgical risk associated with smoking. 8 A functional assessment should be performed, and the physician should review the patient's social support and need for assistance after hospital discharge.

For example, a patient who is scheduled for hip replacement surgery and has limited assistance available at home may require home services or temporary placement in a rehabilitation facility. Plans for such assistance can be made before hospitalization. At the time of the preoperative evaluation, the patient can be told, in general terms, what to expect during hospitalization and in the perioperative period. Patients who have pulmonary disease or who will undergo abdominal or thoracic surgery can be given instructions for performing incentive spirometry. The patient should also be provided with information about the expected postoperative course and possible complications. Inquiry regarding health care power of attorney and the patient's wishes regarding resuscitation if life-threatening complications arise can also be discussed. 18 Similarly, clinically stable patients who have undergone angioplasty between six months and five years previously require no further assessment.

In contrast, patients who have had angioplasty within the previous six months may require cardiac reevaluation and/or consultation with a cardiologist before surgery. Emergency surgery calls for expedited pre-operative cardiac assessment and management. Patients undergoing elective or semi-elective procedures can proceed with preoperative cardiac testing, as outlined in.

### Factors associated with primary care physician decision-making when making medication recommendations vs surgical referrals [^4afdb381]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

How do the factors associated with primary care physician decision-making differ for medication recommendations compared with surgical referrals?

Findings

This qualitative study found that primary care physicians use evidence-based decision support tools to make medication recommendations and used professional experiences, subjective information on quality, and convenience when making surgical referrals.

Meaning

This study suggests that there is an opportunity to reduce variability and improve surgical outcomes by supporting primary care referral decision-making with valid and reliable data on surgeon and hospital quality.

### Primary palliative care in acute care surgery: an American Association for the Surgery of Trauma critical care committee and palliative care committee clinical consensus document [^479f8f70]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Acute care surgeons occasionally find themselves in a scenario where performing an operation is not likely to be beneficial or improve outcome. Limiting or withholding non-beneficial treatment is ethically responsible in theory. However, in practice, setting external limits on treatment can be very challenging. Indeed, factors associated with the provision of non-beneficial surgery are often outside of the surgeon’s control. In a national survey, more than a third of respondents would offer surgery to a seriously ill patient with an acute surgical problem, even if the surgical intervention was unlikely to provide benefit.Once an acute surgical diagnosis is made, the entire system may be primed to provide further treatment leading toward a surgical intervention, a phenomenon that has been termed ‘clinical momentum’.Surgeons may find it difficult to ‘stop the line’ once sufficient momentum has occurred. In these instances, providing a reframing strategy to communicate to patients/surrogates a framework that promotes shared decision-making is helpful.Surgical discussions often center around the surgical disease as an isolated problem (‘fix it’ model) which may be misleading in patients with significant comorbidities.An interdisciplinary panel has published recommendations for surgeons regarding best communication practices to facilitate goal-concordant care for seriously ill older patients with emergency surgical conditions.This framework centers on a discussion describing the acute surgical problem as it relates to the patient’s underlying illness and prognosis, incorporating the patient’s personal goals and priorities, and culminating in disclosing both surgical as well as non-surgical and palliative treatment options.

### Definition of primary eye care-2014 [^0e834a6e]. AAO (2014). Medium credibility.

Primary Eye Care Physician—role and competencies are defined as observing and assessing visual signs, symptoms, or concerns that patients present, unrestricted by problem origin, with appropriate education and training to manage a large majority of those problems; primary eye care should be provided by, or supervised by, qualified physicians who have the competencies to discover and differentiate abnormal states from normal, to diagnose disease conditions, to relate general medical conditions and symptoms to possible eye diseases, to triage and manage effectively eye diseases and conditions or refer patients for specialized treatment, to coordinate with other physicians and health care professionals to meet general health care needs, to develop a treatment plan and take care of the large majority of eye care needs encountered in the general population, and to perform surgery when necessary.

### Primary palliative care in acute care surgery: an American Association for the Surgery of Trauma critical care committee and palliative care committee clinical consensus document [^d6a4e735]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2025). Medium credibility.

What is the role of procedures and surgery in patients who have comfort-focused goals or are not pursuing disease-directed therapies?

Recommendation

In patients with comfort-focused goals or who are not pursuing disease-directed therapies, procedures and surgery should be carefully considered based on individual preferences, quality of life impact, and potential for symptom management.

Discussion

In patients prioritizing comfort-focused goals over disease-directed therapies, decision-making regarding procedures and surgery necessitates careful consideration of individual preferences, quality of life impact, and potential symptom management. Comfort-focused care aims to enhance well-being and alleviate distressing symptoms, sometimes through procedural interventions (eg, paracentesis to relieve ascites or thoracentesis for pleural effusions) or surgery (eg, gastrostomy tube, stoma creation, or bypass for gastrointestinal obstruction).These procedures may provide symptomatic relief, improve function, and enhance overall comfort, thereby contributing to the patient’s quality of life. Similarly, interventions like nerve blocks or palliative radiation can effectively mitigate pain and improve overall quality of life in those with advanced illnesses.Palliative radiation aims to shrink tumors or alleviate symptoms such as pain, bleeding, or obstruction, thus enhancing comfort.

However, the decision to pursue these treatments should involve shared decision-making and a thorough assessment of the patient’s values, preferences, and goals, emphasizing open communication.While some procedures may significantly enhance quality of life, careful evaluation of their potential benefits and risks in the context of the patient’s prognosis is essential to ensure alignment with comfort-focused care principles. This approach underscores the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and patient-centered care to optimize outcomes. A holistic approach that addresses physical, psychological, social, and spiritual aspects of care may be used to promote comfort.By prioritizing open communication and patient-centered care, clinicians can optimize outcomes and enhance the quality of life for patients.

How should the acute care surgeon respond when asked to perform an operation that they consider harmful or non-beneficial, unlikely to achieve the patient’s goals, or unlikely to change the trajectory of illness?

Recommendation

A standardized structural communication framework should be used to ensure that patients receive care that is aligned with their values and goals while avoiding non-beneficial surgery. Surgeons should recommend treatment options that align with the patient’s values and goals. Patients and families expect surgeons to use their clinical experience and knowledge when making recommendations and to compassionately communicate when they deem a treatment option to be harmful or non-beneficial.

### A framework to optimize primary care of older surgical patients: a qualitative study of geriatricians [^346f52e0]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

The population of the United States is aging, with the number of adults older than 65 years expected to nearly double to 95 million people by 2060.Caring for older adults is complex and requires managing chronic conditions, polypharmacy, cognitive impairment and frailty, and attention to psychosocial situations and goals of care.Internal and family medicine physicians provide the majority of primary care for older adults and are expected to do so for the foreseeable future. Although several programs for internal medicine residents and physicians have been developed to enhance geriatric education,,, there is no national standard. The result is that primary care clinicians receive little formalized training in geriatrics, especially regarding perioperative care.

Older adults are undergoing an increasing number of surgical procedures.Improving surgical care for older adults has become an increasing focus within the surgical community as evidenced by multiple geriatric quality initiatives, such as the American College of Surgeon’s Geriatric Surgery Verification Program and the Institute for Healthcare Improvement’s Age Friendly Healthcare Systems movement. Optimizing perioperative care for the patients is also becoming increasingly important from a hospital administration perspective, as, for example, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid services are considering a geriatric surgery measure for the Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting Program.

Guidelines exist regarding preoperative patient optimization, medical clearance, and inpatient postoperative medical care. However, there is minimal guidance for how primary care clinicians can help their older patients navigate surgical care in the preoperative and postoperative settings. Providing primary care clinicians with evidence-based insight into how to assist with decision-making about pursuing surgery, communicate with the surgical team, advocate for their patients, and support transitions of care will help optimize surgical care for older adults. We performed a qualitative study to understand the experience and practice patterns of geriatricians whose patients require surgery. We explored their perspectives on the perioperative care process, from the time that a patient presents with a surgical disease through their surgical recovery. This information was used to develop a framework to optimize primary care delivery for older patients requiring surgery.

### Palliative care best practices guidelines [^a4722f2a]. ACS (2017). Medium credibility.

Global medical center measures in palliative care specify that a defined and identifiable program to provide primary level and specialist palliative care services exists within the medical center, which is available to health care providers 24 hours a day throughout the year. Multidisciplinary agreed-upon policies and procedures to manage pain, anxiety, delirium, and other common distressing symptoms exist and are easily accessible to health care providers. Policies and procedures exist to ensure that clinicians are aware of pre-existing advance directives, DNR orders, health care surrogate decision makers, and/or physician orders for life-sustaining treatments (POLST). An explicit policy exists and is easily accessible to health care providers regarding the management of pre-existing DNR orders for patients requiring operative or other invasive procedures. A policy exists to define the steps to take when conflicts occur between patients, families, and the health care team concerning DNR orders and/or use of life-sustaining treatments.

### Primary palliative care in acute care surgery: an American Association for the Surgery of Trauma critical care committee and palliative care committee clinical consensus document [^135d20a7]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2025). Medium credibility.

A standardized structural communication framework is crucial to ensure that patients receive care that is aligned with their values and goals while avoiding non-beneficial surgery.One aspect of this communication process requiring further study is the role of the surgeon’s opinion and their presentation of treatment options, as well as the heterogeneity in which it may be provided to patients or their surrogates. The presented treatment options can often be on a spectrum ranging from (1) no choice, where surgery is not offered or where surgery is presented as the only option; (2) a biased choice, where the communication is framed for the decision to favor a particular treatment strategy; or (3) a simple choice, where the patient or surrogate is presented with options and the surgeon does not provide a recommendation.Indeed, offering surgery as an option may suggest that the surgeon thinks it is a high-risk but reasonable option rather than non-beneficial.Surgeons should convey their professional assessment and recommendation, thereby providing context and transparency.This recommendation provides the patient and their surrogate the benefit of the surgeon’s expertise rather than burdening them with the sole responsibility for a decision. Surgeons have specialized clinical experience and knowledge that patients and their surrogates expect surgeons to use in deliberating and communicating a treatment recommendation.

Surgeons may find themselves in a situation where a patient or family is asking the surgeon to provide treatment that the surgeon deems harmful or non-beneficial. Surgeons are not ethically or legally obligated to offer treatments that will not benefit the patient, even if the patient or family do not agree with their assessment. Many healthcare systems have policies to help address this conflict, often with input from a hospital ethics committee. Specialty palliative care services may also be engaged to provide support to both the surgical team and the patient and their family.

### Kickstart patient movement: a 5-step framework for primary care clinicians to support inactive patients in becoming more active [^26141a96]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Physical activity (PA) offers major health benefits, including the prevention and management of chronic diseases.Around 5 million global deaths annually are attributed to physical inactivity. In the UK, it contributes to one in six deaths, which is equivalent to smoking.Of equal importance, it is estimated that 40% of long-term conditions could be prevented if the population successfully met the UK Chief Medical Officer’s PA recommendations.The evidence is clear: getting the nation moving is a public health imperative. In the UK Government’s green paper on preventing ill health, the 2020s were hailed as the era of ‘proactive, predictive, and personalised prevention’. Fast forward to 2025, and yet exercise is still absent from many treatment plans, and global PA levels have stagnated.A key barrier appears to be the perceived lack of clinician knowledge or confidence in initiating conversations about PA and cocreating tailored plans with patients based on their individual circumstances and variables.Indeed, more than 50% of UK-based primary care physicians have previously reported they had not undertaken any training in PA counselling or advice.Effective guidance must consider a range of individual factors, including current and past activity levels, relevant comorbidities, personal preferences, motivations and barriers. As a result, tailored exercise advice often gets sidelined, and patients miss out on its powerful benefits. That needs to change. Previous research exploring primary care clinicians’ perspectives on promoting PA has identified that having a clear structure and greater confidence in PA-related discussions can play a crucial role in overcoming many of the structural and logistical barriers they face.

Therefore, this viewpoint presents a practical, five-step framework, grounded in research and real-world experience, to help healthcare professionals confidently support inactive patients in becoming more physically active. It does this by integrating core principles of PA counselling, including motivational interviewing, risk screening and the frequency, intensity, time and type (FITT) principle into a practical, accessible framework. It simplifies the often fragmented guidance on PA prescription, offering clinicians a clear, time-efficient tool to support behaviour change in routine practice. A visual infographic (figure 1) translates the five steps into an accessible aid for busy consultations. This viewpoint aims to equip primary care clinicians with the clarity and confidence needed to embed PA advice into their routine care. In doing so, it supports the shift towards proactive, personalised and preventive healthcare.

### Factors associated with primary care physician decision-making when making medication recommendations vs surgical referrals [^20ef4abe]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Conclusions

This qualitative study suggests that PCPs’ common practice of using DSTs for medication selection may be transferrable to the surgical referral process. In the absence of objective data, PCPs rely on professional experiences, personal beliefs about quality, and convenience to guide surgical recommendations. Surgical outcomes data with tools to aid in decision-making may disrupt current physician referral practices and improve access to high-quality surgical care.

### A framework to optimize primary care of older surgical patients: a qualitative study of geriatricians [^8b01d546]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Advocate for Patient and Family

Geriatricians identify advocating for the patient and family throughout the perioperative process as an important part of their role:

I have to fight for the patient. I’m their advocate, and maybe the patient can’t speak up for themselves, or maybe a patient’s family member is timid or won’t talk to the surgeon or won’t ask the right questions or don’t know what questions to ask, so I’ll ask for them. (Participant 4)

Multiple situations that would require geriatrician advocacy for their patients were identified (Table 4).

Table 4. 
Reasons That Geriatricians Advocate for Patient and Family With Exemplar Quotes

Postoperative Care Coordination

Geriatricians help prepare the patient and family for surgical recovery by discussing discharge disposition, patient social support, and other resources that may be needed:

Who they will need to have at home… what kind of services they might need. Would they need to go to a rehab? …If they need to call their family, or they need to hire an aide, or they to have somebody there to give them a shower, …whatever they might need, we’ve already discussed that on that visit. (Participant 24)

After leaving the hospital, participants ensure that patients have clinical follow-up and access to needed medications and support services:

The idea is to… make sure that they are able to function. They have the support that they need, and they’re cognitively fine…. They’re not having complications of the perioperative period. All the services they would need like physical therapy… they would need they should have. That is what our concern is. They have their medications, and their pain is controlled. So we make a phone call within 48 hours of their discharge, and that’s a must for our practice. (Participant 24)

Geriatricians also triage and manage patient postoperative questions, often reaching out to the surgical team for clarification:

They call us and [ask] does this suture look normal… and then I did… a video visit looking at things like Steri-Strips, I’m like, “I’m pretty sure from looking at this note that you’re just supposed to leave those in place, and I’ll send a picture to your oncologist, or your surgical oncologist, but I think your incision is fine but really I can’t tell them that definitively.” (Participant 18)

### Lessons from the implementation of a trauma center-based program to support primary care providers in managing opioids and pain after trauma hospitalization [^d4e98c3a]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2023). Medium credibility.

Implications for level I trauma centers

Hospital discharge services routinely include development of a discharge summary that is sent to the patients’ follow-up care providers.Ensuring that these discharge summaries clearly and specifically designate the provider responsible for post-trauma care and opioid management after discharge and a clear opioid taper plan would be a first step toward supporting patients and their PCPs. Discharge care coordinators who facilitate the discharge planning for inpatients could take responsibility for ensuring that this tailored information is provided consistently in all discharge summaries. Second, Zatzick et al ’s care management program for patients both prior to and after trauma discharge resulted in fewer serious concerns in the 6 months after trauma discharge as well as fewer emergency department visits 3–6 months after discharge.Trauma hospitalizations are frequently complex and require multiple services (eg, multiple surgeons, pain management specialists, physical and occupational therapists) to optimize outcomes. This complex care from multiple services can lead to complex discharge management needs, making a navigator like a care coordinator critical for patients after discharge. For post-trauma patients who live distant from the trauma center and are at high risk of adverse outcomes, this can be even more important. Testing a multilevel intervention that includes both a patient-level intervention with a navigator or care manager and a PCP-level intervention with an opioid management component would shed light on whether Zatzick’s care management intervention findings could be replicated and perhaps amplified for this selected group. Preliminary investigation supports the feasibility of a patient-level care management intervention for patients with OUD.

### Integrated care for people with multimorbidity into elective surgical pathways: mixed-methods co-design study [^13acaf14]. The British Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

Phase 1: contextual analysis of current pathways

Phase 1A: pathway mapping

Between July and September 2024, 12 site-specific pathway-mapping sessions were conducted with 20 multidisciplinary stakeholders (including 4 surgeons, 3 perioperative physicians, 4 geriatricians, 2 nurses and allied health professionals, 1 primary care clinician, and 1 patient representative). A detailed description of the expert stakeholders is provided in Table S3. Using a standardized journey-mapping board (that is referral, listing, preassessment, optimization during waiting, day of surgery, discharge, and postoperative follow-up), a composite pathway describing the patient journey was produced (Fig. 2). Four recurring structural bottlenecks were identified. First, limited preoperative optimization; assessments were typically scheduled only 2 weeks before surgery, restricting the opportunity for intervention in high-risk patients. Second, inadequate chronic disease management; conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and anaemia were poorly optimized before hospital admission, leading to delays or cancellations. Third, fragmented information systems; clinicians manually reconciled medication and investigation data across disconnected records, increasing inefficiencies. Fourth, delayed lifestyle-risk interventions; smoking cessation efforts were initiated too late in the pathway, despite many patients being listed for surgery months in advance. Across sites, consistent gaps in core steps were identified, but there were notable site-variant options with regard to: timing and locus of preassessment (surgical clinic versus perioperative medicine clinic); source of referrals (initiated by a surgeon versus initiated by a specialist nurse); and content of discharge letters (presence/absence of explicit MLTC actions and targets). These differences were preserved in the composite pathway as clearly labelled optional branches, while core steps were defined by majority practice. Member checking confirmed the composite pathway reflected local realities; suggested edits focused on labelling and sequencing rather than adding new steps. To address these deficiencies, stakeholders identified four high-impact solutions through consensus voting: routine MLTC screening at the point of surgical listing; automated digital referrals to primary care or disease-specific services; a shared electronic care plan accessible across healthcare settings: and a named care coordinator for continuity throughout the perioperative interval.

### Primary palliative care in acute care surgery: an American Association for the Surgery of Trauma critical care committee and palliative care committee clinical consensus document [^e016831e]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2025). Medium credibility.

What screening tools are available to identify which acute care surgery patient populations may benefit from palliative care?

Recommendation

Systematic screening and identification of palliative care needs among acute care surgery patients should be initiated at time of admission and completed within 24 hours. The ‘Surprise Question’ is useful for screening diverse patient populations for palliative care needs.

Discussion

Identifying the need for early incorporation of palliative care is key to optimizing its benefits. This is particularly true in the acute care surgery population, as a patient’s status may change rapidly. Consistent implementation of a screening system for palliative care is essential and should be initiated at hospital admission and completed within 24 hours.While numerous screening tools exist, validation and utility for prognostication remain limited. Among available screening tools, the ‘Surprise Question’ is widely recognized. Validated in various settings across diverse patient populations, the simplicity belies its effectiveness.Practitioners need only ask themselves, ‘Would you be surprised if this patient were dead in 12 months?’ For patients prompting a ‘no’ or ‘maybe’ response, early consideration of palliative care should be strongly considered.

The American College of Surgeons (ACS) Trauma Quality Improvement Program Palliative Care Best Practices Guidelines advocate for the integration of the ‘Surprise Question’ into a comprehensive screening process.The screening approach stratifies patients into different categories (table 2) and recommends appropriate palliative care interventions (table 3). Those who screen negative typically represent a younger cohort with a favorable prognosis. In contrast, patients experiencing potentially life-threatening or disabling injuries, particularly those with baseline comorbidity, frailty, or older age, should be considered for early incorporation of palliative care.

Table 2 
ACS Trauma Quality Improvement Program Palliative Care Best Practices Guidelines: palliative care screening for injured patients

Table 3 
ACS Trauma Quality Improvement Program Palliative Care Best Practices Guidelines: palliative care screening recommendations for injured patients

While the ‘Surprise Question’ is easily applied to diverse patient populations, other screening instruments have been validated within specific patient populations. For instance, tools are available to assess appropriateness of palliative care among older people with multiple advanced chronic illnesses and those with dementia.The selection of a screening tool must align with both patient characteristics as well as needs and preferences. Validation metrics vary for each tool, encompassing factors such as short-term mortality, discharge disposition, and resource utilization.

What frameworks are best suited to allow acute care surgeons to deliver serious news, discuss prognosis and treatment options, and assist with complex shared decision-making with patients, their families, and surrogate decision-makers?

### Comanagement of surgical pediatric patients in the acute care inpatient setting [^6b73637e]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Pediatric surgical comanagement—priority themes and suggested approaches were elicited from round 1 input “From 25 Pediatric Hospital Medicine, Pediatric Anesthesiology, and Pediatric Subspecialty Surgery Leaders,” with PH (pediatric hospitalists) explicitly defined. Suggested approaches include Leadership (“Identify champions from surgery and PH; allocate appropriate resources for comanagement program”), Patient selection (“Establish process for assigning comanagement or consultation based on medical/surgical complexity; consideration of preoperative clinic”), Patient-level communication for nurses and other staff (“Define explicit roles or division of responsibilities; provide clarity for physician, nurses, families; classify urgency of calls: stat, urgent, or nonurgent; clarify role of trainees, nurse practitioners, other providers”), Patient-level communication between surgeons and PH (“Establish modality [rounding, phone call, trainees] and frequency for routine communication/clinical changes; clarify role of trainees, nurse practitioners, other providers; establish and encourage postoperative direct hand-off”), Documentation models (“Require daily notes by both teams; establish clear responsibility for discharge materials”), Quality assessment and improvement (“Establish case review/morbidity and mortality conferences; measure adherence to pathways and outcomes”), Risks of comanagement (“Shared responsibility can devolve to shared irresponsibility without sharp and clear definition of roles”), Complex care (“Consider a preoperative multidisciplinary clinic with PH; establish rules for automatic consults: essential for those with any hardware; coordination of care for nutritional, pulmonary, neurology, and other needs; establish when patient is served best on primary PH service versus primary surgical service; conduct multidisciplinary rounds with subspecialists”), Community hospitals (“Depends on system and availability of services; foster mutual understanding on limits of which patients are best cared for at community hospitals and by PH, by age or medical criteria; establish degree of support services [physical therapy, nutrition, etc] with adequate expertise; ensure proper pediatric equipment; ensure PH availability for general surgeons with limited pediatric experience; increase awareness of child- and family-centered specific needs”), and Tertiary care centers (“Ensure communication at different levels of hierarchy [house staff, attending physicians, advanced practice providers]; establish process for determining which patients are to be comanaged by condition versus consult versus no PH involvement”).

### 2019 AATS / ACC / ASE / SCAI / STS expert consensus systems of care Document: a proposal to optimize care for patients with valvular heart disease: a joint report of the American Association for Thoracic Surgery, American college of cardiology, American Society of Echocardiography, Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions, and Society of Thoracic Surgeons [^bf9162c1]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Valvular heart disease (VHD) systems of care—core principles—state that the primary goal is to improve the care of all patients with VHD, with the first step being recognition and subsequent diagnosis by a primary care physician, advanced practice provider, or general cardiologist, followed by referral to a local general cardiologist to refine diagnosis, initiate indicated medical therapy, and identify those manageable without further intervention or needing specialized care such as surgery or transcatheter valve repair or replacement. Access to specialized care requires well-defined referral lines to centers with graduated expertise, with higher-order, comprehensive care at a Level I center and less complex disease managed at a Level II center. A Multidisciplinary Team (MDT) and patient shared decision-making are essential to operations of Level I and II valve centers. Full institutional support is required for imaging and procedural resources, equity among MDT stakeholders, care pathways spanning the continuum, registry participation, and results reporting. Transparency, public reporting, mandatory participation in national registries, ongoing analysis of processes and outcomes, and commitment to research are essential, while bidirectional communication and ongoing education of MDT members and referring providers/centers are required to improve quality of care in all settings. Processes of care should emphasize informed consent, shared decision-making, patient experiences, and individual choices.

### Patient risk screening to improve transitions of care in surgical opioid prescribing: a qualitative study of provider perspectives [^625d7f22]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Perioperative care coordination

In order to inform intervention, providers were asked what current challenges they experience when caring for patients at risk for poor opioid-related outcomes. These challenges were grouped by timeframe into the preoperative and postoperative settings, and illustrative quotes are detailed in box 3. Preoperative challenges cited include difficulty with preoperative taper, access to pain specialists, coordination across providers and institutions, and setting patient expectations regarding pain control. Postoperative challenges include poor pain control, coordination of care, and access to pain specialists for postsurgical pain management. One usual prescriber/primary care provider described the challenges associated with the preoperative taper of a complex patient on chronic opioids due to poor pain control, and subsequent challenges of the patient returning to their care after opioids prescribed by the surgeon expired. This process of returning to primary care postoperatively relates to the challenge of coordination of care described by both primary care providers and anesthesiologists. One anesthesiologist described the complexity of coordination between specialists and across institutions as the largest challenge they face in developing a pain control plan for a patient with potential or known OUD.

Box 3 
Summary of challenges associated with current practices

Availability of pain specialty care

The majority of surgeons and anesthesiologists identified challenges in connecting patients with pain specialists with expertize in optimizing preoperative opioid weaning who would then continue to follow these patients in the postoperative setting. This involved both an access issue, as Pain specialists were described as too busy to handle the volume, and also a process, timing, and coordination of care issue, as referrals would need to be placed by providers well in advance of the planned surgery. More broadly, the combination of challenges with coordination of care and access to specialists was described by one anesthesiologist as the lack of a clear delineation of who is responsible for the preoperative optimization of a patient at risk.

### Factors associated with primary care physician decision-making when making medication recommendations vs surgical referrals [^7c4afb90]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Importance

Although objective data are used routinely in prescription drug recommendations, it is unclear how referring physicians apply evidence when making surgeon or hospital recommendations for surgery.

Objective

To compare the factors associated with the hospital or surgeon referral decision-making process with that used for prescription medication recommendations.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This qualitative study comprised interviews conducted between April 26 and May 18, 2021, of a purposive sample of 21 primary care physicians from a large primary care network in the Northeast US.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Main outcomes were the factors considered when making prescription medication recommendations vs referral recommendations to specific surgeons or hospitals for surgery.

Results

All 21 participant primary care physicians (14 women [66.7%]) reported use of evidence-based decision support tools and patient attributes for prescription medication recommendations. In contrast, for surgeon and hospital referral recommendations, primary care physicians relied on professional experience and training, personal beliefs about surgical quality, and perceived convenience. Primary care physicians cited perceived limitations of existing data on surgical quality as a barrier to the use of such data in the process of making surgical referrals.

Conclusions and Relevance

As opposed to the widespread use of objective decision support tools for guidance on medication recommendations, primary care physicians relied on subjective factors when making referrals to specific surgeons and hospitals. The findings of this study highlight the potential to improve surgical outcomes by introducing accessible, reliable data as an imperative step in the surgical referral process.

### The International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) guidelines for the care of heart transplant recipients [^e7c89b1e]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2023). High credibility.

Topic 13: Principles of shared care after heart transplantation—The heart transplant (HT) team should ensure that other involved physicians are provided telephone numbers and electronic mail addresses to enable contact and prompt responses, and primary care physicians should be encouraged to follow the patient with the HT team to allow shared care as distance from surgery increases. Once stable, care is increasingly shared with local physicians, and the transplant center should ensure the local center/physician has sufficient expertise and that adequate exchange of center specific protocols occurs to allow a seamless transition of care (Class I, Level of Evidence: C). The HT team should have periodic conference calls with local centers to discuss care, enable ongoing discussions, and review appropriate management of complications, including medical, psychological, social, or health behavior problems (Class I, Level of Evidence: C). Supporting principles emphasize timely communication among referring physicians, specialists, and primary care providers, an identified process for relaying patient clinical information, encouragement of primary care participation via clear communication of protocols and patient health information, and ensuring the patient and primary care physician know how to reach the transplant center in case of emergency.

Hospital discharge—criteria and ERAS impact: Hospital discharge should be criteria-based and include assessment for ambulation, adequate pain control with oral analgesics, and tolerance of diet. Written information should be provided, including guidelines to notify the surgical team, recovery advice, and emergency contact information. Flatus is not necessary before discharge, and specific guidelines for patients undergoing same-day discharge should be made available. Notably, implementation of an ERAS program has not been shown to increase readmission rate or work for the primary care provider.

### Clinical updates in women's health care summary: surgical considerations: primary and preventive care review [^9ae84dec]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). Medium credibility.

Obstetrician-gynecologists often incorporate surgical procedures in the care of women. Each phase of a woman's life cycle presents different challenges regarding preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative management. Appropriate workup and preparation of patients for surgery are key to a successful surgical outcome. As women age, their risk of medical comorbidities, such as coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, or obesity, increases, as does the need for surgical procedures. Correctly identifying medical conditions and related surgical risks will help obstetrician-gynecologists provide safe, appropriate, and evidence-based care to women. Increasingly, obstetrician-gynecologists work in the setting of multidisciplinary teams, and many have access to preoperative assessment clinics and hospitalists to assist in the management of preoperative and perioperative patients. It is the responsibility of the referring physician to understand the services these clinics and hospitalists provide. An appropriate and cost-effective evidence-based preliminary workup, such as laboratory and imaging tests, also is important. The purpose of this monograph is to help guide obstetrician-gynecologists through the appropriate preoperative assessment of women who require surgery and identify intraoperative and postoperative management strategies that will help decrease avoidable morbidity and mortality of these patients.

### A framework to optimize primary care of older surgical patients: a qualitative study of geriatricians [^69accc5d]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Results

Participant Demographics

Twenty-eight geriatricians expressed interest in participating in the study. Four were lost to follow-up. Of the 24 geriatricians (16 [67%] women) who enrolled and were interviewed, the median time in practice was 12.4 years (IQR, 5.0-24.5 years), and 11 (46%) worked at an academic or tertiary referral center. Characteristics of study participants are shown in Table 1.

Table 1. 
Characteristics of the Study Population

Abbreviations: DO, doctor of osteopathic medicine; MBBS, bachelor of medicine, bachelor of surgery; MD, doctor of medicine; NP, nurse practitioner; PA, physician assistant; PACE, Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly.

From the thematic analysis, 7 overarching themes emerged representing actions performed by primary care geriatricians to support patients through the perioperative process in addition to typical preoperative clearance. The major themes identified were conducting a risk-benefit analysis of the surgical referral, eliciting and communicating patient goals, preparing the patient and family for surgical consultation, setting realistic expectations, assisting with decision about surgery, advocating for the patient and family, and coordinating postoperative care. These actions began when a patient was identified to have a disease that may require surgery and many continued through the perioperative period until surgical recovery. We organized these actions into a framework that primary care clinicians may follow when guiding older patients through the time of a surgical diagnosis through postoperative recovery (Figure).

Framework for Primary Care Clinicians to Support Older Patients With Surgical Conditions

The framework is based on geriatrician actions that primary care clinicians may use when supporting older patients throughout the surgical continuum.

### Responsible innovation in children's surgical care [^a63c0ae6]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Responsible innovation in children’s surgical care—Innovation in surgery may involve the translation of a completely novel concept into a new procedure or device or the adaptation of existing treatment approaches or technology to a new clinical application, and innovation should have, as its primary goal, the enhancement of care leading to improved outcomes from the patient’s perspective. This policy statement examines innovation as it pertains to surgical care, focusing on definitions that help differentiate applied innovation or innovative therapy from research, and examines the ethical challenges and the potential for conflict of interest for surgeons or institutions seeking to offer innovative surgical therapy. The importance of engaging patients and families as “innovation partners” to ensure complete transparency of expectations from the patient’s and provider’s perspectives is also examined, with specific emphasis on cultural competence and mutually respectful approaches, and a framework for identifying, evaluating, and safely implementing innovative surgical therapy in children is provided. Background context notes that surgery involves risks that often go beyond the usual risks of adverse outcome associated with a diagnostic test or drug treatment; although treatment standardization through protocols and practice guidelines is recognized as an effective harm‑reduction strategy, surgeons have also placed high value on applied creativity to respond to unexpected findings, which has brought advances such as solid organ transplantation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and minimally invasive surgery, sometimes without clear evidence of safety and efficacy before dissemination. This policy statement was reaffirmed September 12, 2023.

### Guidelines for perioperative care in elective abdominal and pelvic surgery at primary and secondary hospitals in low-middle-income countries (LMIC' s): enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) society recommendation [^4a84d41e]. World Journal of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Results

The definitions, grade of evidence and recommendations of perioperative care items are summarized in Table 1. In addition to previously described ERAS® Society interventions, the following items were included, revised or discussed: the Surgical Safety Checklist (SSC), preoperative routine human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing in countries with a high prevalence of HIV/AIDS (CD4 and viral load for those patients that are HIV positive), delirium screening and prevention, COVID 19 screening, VTE prophylaxis, immuno-nutrition, prehabilitation, minimally invasive surgery (MIS) and a standardized postoperative monitoring guideline.

Preoperative education

The aim of preoperative education is to establish clear expectations about the surgical and anesthetic care plan, ensure that the patient and their families understand their role in successful recovery, and to establish discharge plans preoperatively. Preoperative education has been shown to reduce patient anxiety, pain, nausea and vomiting and increase patient satisfaction. Patients managed under an ERAS pathway are discharged in an intermediate phase of recovery, with the recovery process expected to extend into the home setting. Managing this transition and ensuring that it is tailored to the individual patient needs is crucial to ensure that patients and care givers feel safe and reassured and have clear and concise emergency contact details and transport plans. This is particularly important in LMIC’s where a frequent challenge is long travel distances and poor access to transport.

Ideally the patient and a relative or care giver should receive preoperative education in oral, written and or pictorial format. Preoperative education is usually carried out by the ERAS nurse coordinator soon after the decision is made to operate. This allows the patient, their families and care givers sufficient time to process the information. A nurse coordinator and wider multidisciplinary team (MDT)are unlikely to be available in the primary and secondary hospital setting in LMIC’s and this role will need to be fulfilled by an elected health care professional.

Summary: Preoperative education is given to the patient and a relative or care giver in oral, written and or pictorial format.

Preoperative optimization

In addition to clinical cardiorespiratory assessment, patients should be screened for smoking, alcohol usage, undiagnosed hypertension, diabetes, anemia, nutritional assessment, routine preoperative HIV testing in countries with high prevalence of HIV and cognitive assessment. The long lead time from scheduling to proceeding with surgery in LMIC’s could provide an opportunity to optimize patients preoperatively.

### A framework to optimize primary care of older surgical patients: a qualitative study of geriatricians [^2ad84c50]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Elicit and Communicate Patient Goals

Eliciting and communicating patient goals is a key action geriatricians perform when navigating a patient through the surgical process, guiding appropriate decision-making and clinical care:

Goals and preferences are part and parcel of good geriatric practice because these are patients often with limited life expectancy, and their goals may not always be my goals, and if I don’t know what they are we can’t align properly. (Participant 2)

Geriatricians identified 4 approaches to eliciting patient goals of care: leveraging longitudinal relationships with their patients, discussing current quality of life, using existing frameworks, and ensuring that caregivers and/or family members are included in the conversation when possible (Table 3). Further, geriatricians try to communicate goals of care in a way that makes them accessible to surgeons at the time of consultation:

When I send our personalized message to surgeon besides my note I really highlight [goals and preferences], so it’s… important, and I believe that has helped my surgeon colleagues to plan or counsel appropriately. (Participant 22)

However, they identify that this is often difficult to do in the electronic medical record (EMR):

Table 3. 
Approaches to Eliciting Patient Goals of Care When Considering Surgery

I hope there will be [a] more discrete place for all of those to be easily seen in the EMR, like if… the unique things about the patients will pop up so clearly that no one can ignore or skip their goals of care, what their values are or… what matters to them. (Participant 22)

Prepare Patient and Family for Surgical Consultation

After deciding to refer a patient for a surgical consultation, geriatricians help patients and families get ready for the consultation. This process includes giving patients education on the disease process that they are going to be seen for:

I’ll make sure they understand… their disease process, what are they undergoing, and I’ll understand some of them still have questions. We try to answer it as much as possible. (Participant 17)

Participants also describe coaching patients on questions that they or their support person may want to ask during their visit:

I try to set up the patient, I say this is the question you’re going to ask, these are the things that you’re going to discuss, and I try to repeat that as many times or talk to the caregiver. (Participant 10)

### Patient risk screening to improve transitions of care in surgical opioid prescribing: a qualitative study of provider perspectives [^c3df9446]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Some of these actions might require coordination with the usual prescriber (eg, primary care provider), a pain service, or the anesthesiologist on the day of surgery.

Among surgeons, two did not address opioid risk and one left it to other members of the surgical or anesthesia teams. As a neurosurgeon put it, ‘We try our hardest not to concern ourselves with their pain meds, I’ll be honest with you. We let everyone else manage it. We do our surgeries and we stick to our area of expertize and let them stick to theirs’ (Participant 11). At the other extreme, two surgeons considered themselves to be primarily responsible for addressing risk. No pattern by subspecialty was discerned. A majority of surgeons said they educate all patients about pain expectations after surgery, some using preprinted material. Several said they also discuss expectations about postoperative weaning of prescribed opioids.

While primary care providers described a potential role in completing the preoperative history and physical exam and responding to any potential patient concerns, particularly their chronic pain or SUD patients, they did not identify a potential role in preoperative screening for opioid exposure or potential OUD. As one said, ‘Since I’m not the one deciding if somebody needs surgery, I’m probably not actually involved in that process’ (Participant 14). Some noted that they frequently do not learn of their patient’s surgery until after it is finished, at which point they then have a role in addressing any postsurgical opioid-related outcomes. If made aware of surgery in advance, primary care providers may proactively discuss potential concerns and pain expectations with the surgeon. A provider who commonly sees opioid exposed, chronic care patients described recommending preoperative tapering and maximizing use of non-opioid adjuncts prior to surgery.

Current challenges in addressing patient risk

### Change in healthcare utilisation after surgical treatment: observational study of routinely collected patient data from primary and secondary care [^c2f1511b]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2022). Medium credibility.

The surgical population is ageing more rapidly than the general population; by 2030 a further 500 000 patients aged more than 75 yr will have surgery.Advanced age is a key feature of high-risk patients, so it is likely that as more older patients undergo surgery, the size of the high-risk population will increase.This is important for policymakers as they plan future primary and secondary care services to accommodate to this need. Although we identified that the largest increase in healthcare contacts was in secondary care, most healthcare was provided by primary care both before and after surgery. Although serious complications, such as anastomotic leak, may require an unplanned hospital re-admission, we anticipate that a substantial portion of postoperative complications are managed within primary care. Prior studies have highlighted the potential benefits of early primary care review after surgery. These interventions may be best targeted at high-risk patients.In the context of mounting pressures on primary and secondary care, the effectiveness of this approach to improve outcomes is unclear. However, the very large size of the surgical population means that even modest reductions in postoperative healthcare use will likely have a meaningful impact on the wider healthcare system. Although we measured days in contact with healthcare, the impact on a patient of a hospital admission is likely greater than a primary care attendance. Instead of providing an arbitrary weighting to each encounter, we present the days in contact, stratified by type of encounter for readers to consider. Additional research is required to determine what is leading to the increased healthcare need among high-risk patients. This will enable development of appropriate prevention strategies. These strategies are likely to include preoperative optimisation, perioperative treatments to reduce complications and postoperative interventions to enhance recovery.,,Identification of high-risk patients before their operation, and a detailed understanding of how interventions may affect subsequent healthcare need, will facilitate development of these care pathways.

### Handoffs and transitions of care in the intensive care unit: an American Association for the Surgery of Trauma critical care committee clinical consensus document [^b928bf23]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2025). Medium credibility.

What is a handoff or a transition of care?

Recommendation

A handoff or a transition of care is the transfer of information or professional responsibility for the care of a patient to another healthcare provider, ideally through a standardized and uninterrupted process.

Discussion

A handoff is any transfer of information or professional responsibility for the care of a patient to another provider. This transition can be either temporary or long-term and may occur for a variety of reasons, such as overnight or weekend coverage, transfer to another primary team, or transfer to another unit/facility.

It is estimated that a physician participates in up to 300 handoffs a month.Given the high volume of this essential process, it is important that a handoff provides an efficient transfer of accurate and relevant information between engaged teams. The information included in a handoff may vary based on the complexity of care and acuity of patient conditions but it is generally accepted that standardization of the process is beneficial and may prevent harm.The methods and factors that should be included in handoffs will be discussed in more detail elsewhere in this document.

### Clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and treatment of children and adolescents with obesity [^60b96707]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Pediatric metabolic and bariatric surgery—referral and evaluation should be individualized: a referral to a comprehensive center with experience treating patients younger than 18 years does not necessarily mean the child will ultimately have surgery, and for younger children, recommendations for referral to a comprehensive multidisciplinary obesity treatment center with surgical capability should be considered on a case-by-case basis; additional research is needed before broad recommendations can be made for children 12 years and younger. Age is not the sole determinant of eligibility; the pediatrician or other PHCP should take into account the patient’s physical and psychosocial needs, and evaluation should include a holistic view of the patient and family, including individual and social risk factors. Families should be fully informed of the benefits and risks, their preferences are paramount, and the decision to continue care with a pediatrician or pediatric medical or surgical subspecialist should be made solely by the patient (and the family, as appropriate). Pediatricians and other PHCPs should be familiar with clearly defined benchmarks and should also seek to establish a local and/or regional referral mechanism to qualified pediatric-focused surgical facilities; initial steps toward consideration should be provided, when appropriate, within the medical home.

### Roadmap for transforming preoperative assessment to preoperative optimization [^bf1c2733]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2020). Medium credibility.

Preoperative assessment typically equates to evaluating and accepting the presenting condition of the patient (unless extreme) and commonly occurs only a few days before the planned surgery. While this timing enables a preoperative history and examination and mitigates unexpected findings on the day of surgery that may delay throughput, it does not allow for meaningful preoperative management of modifiable medical conditions. Evidence is limited regarding how best to balance efforts to mitigate modifiable risk factors versus the timing of surgery. Furthermore, while the concept of preoperative risk modification is not novel, evidence is lacking for successful and sustained implementation of such an interdisciplinary, collaborative program. A better understanding of perioperative care coordination and, specifically, implementing a preoperative preparation process can enhance the value of surgery and surgical population health. In this article, we describe the implementation of a collaborative preoperative clinic with the primary goal of improving patient outcomes.

### Building a patient-centered medical home: obtaining the patient's voice [^b5de6955]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

Many primary care practices are currently attempting to transform into patient-centered medical homes (PCMHs), but little is known about how patients view aspects of the PCMH or how they define patient-centeredness.

Methods

We conducted 3 focus groups with patients from urban academic internal medicine practices. We asked questions about patients' perceptions of what patient-centered care should be; care quality, teams and access; diabetes self-management; and community connections and services. We used a grounded theory approach to the analysis.

Results

The global themes that arose in our focus groups included the desire for timely, clear, and courteous communication; a practice that is structured to facilitate an ongoing relationship with a provider who knows the patient; and a relationship that allows the patient both to trust the provider's guidance and to engage more fully in his or her own care.

Conclusions

Our patients want a provider to know them personally and to take time to listen to their issues. They feel that they cannot access their providers in a timely fashion, find our automated phone systems frustrating, and want more time with their provider. Although the technological and structural implementation of the PCMH requires considerable effort and resources, we cannot neglect the relationships we have with our patients. Patients should be involved in this process of change to ensure we address their concerns and preserve the primary care relationships they value.

### A framework to optimize primary care of older surgical patients: a qualitative study of geriatricians [^0b943aaa]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Importance

An increasing number of older adults are undergoing surgery. Older adults face significant challenges throughout the spectrum of perioperative care. No frameworks exist to support primary care clinicians in helping older adults navigate perioperative care beyond preoperative medical clearance.

Objective

We aimed to develop a framework to assist primary care clinicians in surgical care navigation for older patients.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This qualitative study used semistructured interviews with a sample of geriatricians from across the US between January and June 2022. Interviews were conducted one on one via an online video conferencing platform without observers present. Demographics of participants were analyzed using descriptive statistics.

Main Outcome and Measures

Directed content analysis of interview data was used to examine how primary care clinicians can optimally support older patients throughout the perioperative process.

Results

This qualitative study included 24 geriatricians, 16 (67%) women, with median time in practice of 12.4 years (IQR, 5.0-24.5 years). Of those, 11 (46%) worked at an academic or tertiary referral center. Qualitative analysis identified 7 actions that geriatricians perform when caring for patients through the surgical continuum: conduct risk-benefit analysis of surgical referral, elicit and communicate patient goals, prepare patient and family for surgical consultation, set realistic expectations, assist with decision about surgery, advocate for patient and family, and coordinate postoperative care.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this qualitative study of geriatricians, 7 key domains of perioperative care for older adults were identified. The resulting framework can be used by primary care clinicians as they help their older patients navigate surgical care.

### A framework to optimize primary care of older surgical patients: a qualitative study of geriatricians [^25384ea4]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Set Realistic Expectations

Another role for geriatricians is ensuring that patients and their family members have accurate expectations about the outcomes from surgery:

A lot of patients… have very unrealistic expectations that they’re gonna be cured by surgery, so… if I talk to a patient about a total knee I’m gonna be very frank and say “Your pre-morbid level of function is not great. You’re gonna have at least a year recovery” and… gauge what they want to do, and some may choose not to do anything, and some say “You know, I’m in such pain, I can’t walk, I’m willing to take that risk,” and I’m willing to go that route with them, so I… try to see if their expectations are realistic. (Participant 23)

Geriatricians emphasize the importance of patients understanding the risks of surgery. They indicate concerns that this topic may not be adequately discussed during the surgical consultation:

My main concern, especially when they go to a surgeon, and I’m not convinced they need surgery, is that the surgeon will tell them, “Yes, I can do the surgery, and yes, it’ll be easy,” but the surgeon’s never going to tell them that they might have a delirium, might never go home again, might end up in a nursing home, or that maybe the pain won’t go away, because it’s not actually from that. (Participant 7)

Geriatricians also seek to ensure understanding of risks and outcomes from pursuing nonsurgical management:

We talk about whether we have an understanding regarding possible outcomes and consequences relating to going through with the procedure or delaying it. And I have the patient… talk to me about what their understanding is. (Participant 27)

Assist With Decision About Surgery

After the surgical consultation, participants frequently help the patient and family decide whether to proceed with surgery:

Once they have the… surgical consultation, I always read the note and then sometimes patients will come back to me and be like, “Well I want to talk to you and decide whether to have it.” And then I’ll try to use a best-case worst-case scenario… to… help figure out expectations and then I’ll also talk to the surgeon… to… make sure we’re on the same page. (Participant 20)

### Detection, evaluation, and management of preoperative anaemia in the elective orthopaedic surgical patient: NATA guidelines [^52856312]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2011). Low credibility.

After completion of the systematic review and meta-analyses and compilation of the evidence into strategically structured tables by the two primary reviewers, a task force consisting of clinical and methodological experts reviewed findings to assess the evidence and provide appropriate recommendations for clinical practice. These findings were reviewed in the context of two panel meetings, and via both telephone and electronic communication.

Members of the task force assessed the quantity, quality, and consistency of the published evidence according to the method proposed by the Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group,using the modified grading system adopted by the American College of Chest Physicians (Fig. 1).The strength of any recommendation depends on two factors: (i) the trade-off between benefits, risks, burden, and cost; and (ii) the confidence in estimates of those benefits and risks (level of evidence). If the trade-off between benefits and risks is clear, the recommendation is strong (Grade 1, ‘we recommend’); if the trade-off is less clear—the best action may differ depending on circumstances or patient or society values—the recommendation is weak (Grade 2, ‘we suggest’). The evidence supporting the recommendation is graded in three levels according to its methodological strength: high-quality evidence (A), usually from meta-analyses or randomized controlled trials; moderate-quality evidence (B), typically from randomized controlled trials with significant limitations or observational studies with large effects; and low-quality evidence (C), usually from observational studies.The key studies supporting the proposed recommendations are listed and annotated in. This framework provides reviewers with guidelines to pursue a systematic evaluation of published evidence with the ultimate goal of providing physicians with an informed expert opinion of the state of the evidence for an intervention of interest.

### Standards of care for the health of transgender and gender diverse people, version 8 [^d922043a]. International Journal of Transgender Health (2022). High credibility.

Gender-affirming surgery—perioperative preparation, shared decision-making, and aftercare: Additional procedures and/or interventions such as hair removal (prior to facial and/or genital surgery) may be required as part of the preoperative process, and consultation with pelvic floor physical therapy may be important (or required) both before and after surgery. It is important surgeons understand the indication(s) and the timing for GAS, and it is important the surgeon and the patient participate in a shared decision-making approach that includes 1) a multidisciplinary approach; 2) an understanding of the patient’s goals and expectations; 3) a discussion regarding the surgical options and associated risks and benefits; and 4) an informed plan for aftercare. Appropriate aftercare is essential for optimizing outcomes, it is important patients are informed about postoperative needs (including local wound care, activity restrictions, time off from work or school, etc.), and it is important the surgeon is available to provide and facilitate postoperative care, refer to specialty services, or both as needed, which may include ongoing support from the primary care provider and mental health professionals (MHPs) and routine primary care (i.e., breast/chest cancer screening, urologic/gynecologic care, etc.).

### Optimal resources for children's surgical care: from the committee on children's surgery American college of surgeons [^aba63a39]. APSA (2014). Medium credibility.

Primary care physicians and pediatricians—roles in children’s surgical care emphasize collaboration and continuity: The patient’s personal physician or pediatrician is important to infants and children of any age and the primary care physician or pediatrician is helpful in providing information about the patient’s history, dealing with long-term problems, and meeting the family’s psychosocial health needs. Primary care physicians and pediatricians are also important to provide continuity of care throughout the patient’s home recovery period and return to health, and the immediate presence of the primary care physician or pediatrician is not a requirement. When a committed surgeon has assumed responsibility for an infant or child with a surgical problem in a Level I, II or III children’s surgical center, he/she should recognize the primary care physician or pediatrician as a valuable resource; depending on the local circumstances, a primary care physician may serve as a member of the care team or may provide continuity of care and act as a liaison with the family. Children with surgical needs should not be admitted or transferred by the primary care physician without the knowledge and active involvement of the surgical service.

### Twenty-first century house calls: a survey of ambulatory care providers to inform organisational telehealth strategy [^2d612d94]. BMJ Health & Care Informatics (2022). High credibility.

Expectation setting for patients and providers

Clinicians identified examples of the types of inappropriate visits to conduct virtually. Several clinicians asked for organisational guidance regarding suitable visit types: exemplars include ‘clear guidelines of appropriate patient type to use Virtual Care’ (primary care); ‘specific diagnoses [and] complaints allowed or disallowed for VV’ (dermatology); and ‘notify the patients what situations, VV would not be appropriate” (primary care).

A subset of clinicians expressed frustration with how patients engaged during VVs, noting the incongruent expectations of patients and providers. A clinician remarked, ‘patients driving during the visit and when asked to pull over or get to a secure position due to risk of distracted driving, [the] patient became enraged. This was on more than one occasion’ (surgery). Another clinician expressed concern regarding the ‘decreased control over environment and boundaries such as trying to connect with an elderly patient while a husband with dementia calling out loudly in the background and daughters interrupting every few minutes’ (internal medicine subspecialty). However, some clinicians offered suggestions to improve patient–provider expectations as an example there should be ‘standard messaging about safe practice during video visits - that is, no driving, need to be in a private space’ (surgery).

### Identifying and reducing inappropriate aspirin use in primary care [^78ce55e1]. BMJ Open Quality (2023). High credibility.

As more data has become available, the benefits, risks and clinical recommendations for using aspirin in primary prevention have become less clear, and the decision to prescribe aspirin has become more individualised. Furthermore, no guidance has been provided on how to best manage patients who were previously prescribed aspirin for primary prevention per previous clinical guidelines. Often, this decision is left to primary care providers, who are in the best position to coordinate complex care for patients and comprehensively manage medications. In light of recent evidence and updated clinical recommendations regarding the safe and appropriate use of aspirin for primary prevention, primary care practices need to develop methods of identifying patients who may be taking aspirin unnecessarily. It is also essential to understand how recent studies and updated recommendations are interpreted by providers and translated into clinical practice.

The objectives of this study were to (1) develop an electronic medical record (EMR)-based systematic method for identifying patients aged 70 and older taking aspirin for primary prevention, (2) provide patient and provider education about updates to recommendations for aspirin use in primary prevention and (3) evaluate the impact of the intervention on aspirin use. In addition, the results of this study provide valuable information for other primary care practices looking to develop methods of identifying patients who may benefit from an assessment of the safety of aspirin use.

### Peri-operative care pathways: re-engineering care to achieve the 'triple aim' [^2ce6e902]. Anaesthesia (2019). Medium credibility.

Elective surgical pathways offer a particular opportunity to plan radical change in the way care is delivered, based on patient need rather than provider convenience. Peri-operative pathway redesign enables improved patient experience of care (including quality and satisfaction), population/public health, and healthcare value (outcome per unit of currency). Among physicians with the skills to work within peri-operative medicine, anaesthetists are well positioned to lead the re-engineering of such pathways. Re-engineered pre-operative pathways open up opportunities for intervention before surgery including shared decision-making, comorbidity management and collaborative behavioural change. Individualised, risk-adapted, intra-operative interventions will drive more reliable and consistent care. Risk-adapted postoperative care, particularly around transitions of care, has a significant role in improving value through peri-operative medicine. Improved integration with primary care providers offers the potential for minimising errors around transitions of care before and after surgery, as well as maximising opportunities for population health interventions, including lifestyle modification (e.g. activity/exercise, smoking and/or alcohol cessation), pain management and sleep medicine. Systematic data collection focused on quality improvement is essential to drive continuous clinical improvement and will be enabled by technological development in predictive analytics, systems modelling and artificial intelligence.

Preoperative Management

Risk factor assessment: Preoperative anemia

Rationale

Anemia is commonand may predispose patients to postoperative transfusion resulting in adverse clinical outcomes. Correction of anemia may prove beneficial prior to TKA/THA by reducing risk of transfusion.

Evidence

The literature search identified 170 articles, of which 13 met the inclusion criteria and were specific to total joint replacement: 2 SRs, 2 RCTs, and 9 observational studies. One SRand 4 observational studies – show that preoperative anemia is associated with increased postoperative transfusion rate. However, the relationship with postoperative clinical outcomes (ie, LOS, mortality) is less clear. For example, 1 National Surgical Quality Improvement Program studyfound higher odds of 30-day mortality after TKA in patients with preoperative anemia but not in THA, while another study found no difference in mortality for either operation up to 1 year postoperatively.The most frequently used definition of anemia is the World Health Organization (WHO)classification using a hemoglobin <13 g/dL (men) and <12 g/dL (women). Two SRs,, 1 RCT,and several observational studies – have shown iron (oral and intravenous) supplementation, erythropoietin, and preoperative autologous donation are effective in reducing postoperative allogenic transfusion; however, the benefit on clinical outcomes (ie, LOS and mortality) is unclear. Routine use of these strategies does not appear to benefit nonanemic patients.

Summary and recommendations

All patients undergoing elective joint replacement should be screened for anemia, and if identified, appropriate evaluation and treatment prior to surgery should be coordinated with the patients’ care team, including their primary care provider.

### Responsible innovation in children's surgical care [^6ac35256]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Summary and recommendations—innovation in children’s surgery: Innovation in children’s surgery should be encouraged and driven primarily by contemporary gaps in care and opportunities for improvement identified by both practitioners and patients. The determination of where a proposed innovative surgical procedure lies on the continuum between clinical practice and clinical research should consider both the degree of departure from usual practices, as well as the evidence of effectiveness and what is known (or unknown) about the risks of the procedure. Although IRBs are the preferred mechanism of oversight when the primary goal of an innovative therapy proposal is the creation of generalizable knowledge (eg, clinical trial), alternative oversight mechanisms are usually required when the primary intent of an innovative therapy is the treatment of a patient with limited conventional therapeutic options. All hospitals providing care to children should use an innovative therapy protocol/process that allows rigorous adjudication, implementation, and postimplementation surveillance of innovative procedures in children, and this process should offer the assurance of patient protection and maintenance of public confidence and trust and should promote procedures that are likely to offer maximal benefit from the patient’s and family’s perspective. The process of informed consent for innovative surgical procedures in children should include, in addition to the usual consent for surgery, a discussion of how the procedure differs from conventional therapy and the fact that all possible outcomes may not yet be known; the process should include full disclosure of any real or perceived conflicts of interest and should consider the involvement of an objective third party and a mandatory “cooling off” period before the granting of consent, and every effort should be made to obtain assent from an age-appropriate child. Innovative surgical therapy for children should be made available to all children, regardless of race or socioeconomic status, and methods of offering and obtaining informed consent must be sensitive to the unique needs of families with respect to language, culture, and health literacy.

### Improving allergy management and treatment: a proposed algorithm and curriculum for prescribing allergen immunotherapy in the primary care setting [^0d7e9965]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The current primary healthcare landscape presents challenges in providing optimal care to AR patients. To complicate matters, there is a shortage of allergists and immunologists, limiting the availability of specialized care for the increasing number of patients who could benefit from AIT. Primary care practitioners often encounter and treat patients with allergies initially. However, gaps in their training and a lack of clear guidance have hindered the effective management of persistent symptoms, resulting in inefficient resource utilization. Accordingly, there is a critical need to equip primary care providers with the corresponding training. This commentary proposes a lucid, comprehensive workflow model for primary care practitioners to address the challenges of treating mild to moderate respiratory allergies and using AIT to manage patients when appropriate. The model aims to guide practitioners through critical steps in patient assessment, pharmacotherapy approaches, and initiating or continuing AIT. Additionally, the paper emphasizes the importance of developing medical education programs and bridging the gap between primary care and allergy-related treatment, which seeks to provide more effective and efficient care for AR patients.

### Primary angle-closure disease preferred practice pattern ® [^cc274148]. Ophthalmology (2021). High credibility.

Appendix 1: Quality of ophthalmic care core criteria—Providing quality care is the physician's foremost ethical obligation, and is the basis of public trust in physicians, and quality ophthalmic care emphasizes a meaningful partnership between patient and physician in which the ophthalmologist strives to communicate effectively and educates his or her patients about the nature and prognosis of their condition and about proper and appropriate therapeutic modalities. The ophthalmologist uses his or her best judgment in choosing and timing appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic modalities as well as the frequency of evaluation and follow-up with due regard to the urgency and nature of the patient's condition and unique needs and desires, and carries out only those procedures for which he or she is adequately trained, experienced, and competent or, when necessary, is assisted by someone who is. Patients are assured access to, and continuity of, needed and appropriate ophthalmic care, including that the ophthalmologist treats patients with due regard to timeliness and appropriateness, the operating ophthalmologist makes adequate provision for appropriate pre- and postoperative patient care, when the ophthalmologist is unavailable he or she provides appropriate alternate ophthalmic care with adequate mechanisms for informing patients of the existence of such care and procedures for obtaining it, and the ophthalmologist refers patients to other ophthalmologists and eye care providers based on the timeliness and appropriateness of such referral, the patient's needs, the competence and qualifications of the person to whom the referral is made, and access and availability.

### Decision-making process reported by Medicare patients who had coronary artery stenting or surgery for prostate cancer [^f87f5b17]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Efforts to improve decision making should continue to focus on increasing patient involvement, but we also think increasing the involvement of primary care providers when decisions are being made would be beneficial. Fewer than three percent of respondents said their primary care provider played a major role in their decisions. Because primary care providers are likely to be less predisposed to a specific treatment than specialists, they may provide more balanced information and may increase the likelihood that conservative options are considered. In addition, there is evidence that patients believe that important decisions are best carried out with their primary care providers.As patient-centered medical homes become robust centers for care coordination it should become more common for patients to rely on that setting for information and guidance when facing decisions.The results also point to the potential value of decision aids: routinely providing patients with unbiased, balanced material in print, DVD or web-based form would be a major step to ensure that patients know all the reasonable options and the pros and cons of each.

The study’s strengths are that data were collected from a national probability sample of Medicare patients who underwent these procedures and the response rates were high. The major limitation is that the data come from patient reports, which may imperfectly reflect the actual interactions with physicians. Also, we surveyed only those who had the procedures. It is possible that those who chose other paths had a better decision making process. However, that does not mitigate the ethical responsibility of providers to inform and involve patients. These patients did get the interventions, and many of them, including the majority of stent patients, were not adequately informed or involved in the decision.

Almost all patients considering prostate cancer surgery should seriously consider radiotherapy and conservative management. Although CABG is often not a reasonable alternative for stent patients like those in this study, all stent candidates with stable angina should seriously consider conservative medical management. The implementation of the PCMH should bring more involvement of primary care physicians in decisions about interventions and increase the likelihood that patients facing major decisions will understand all their options and have their voices heard. The routine use of decision aids would also increase patients’ information about options, though not necessarily their involvement in decisions. Meanwhile, these data provide a challenge and a baseline against which to measure the progress that is very much needed.

### How patient centered are medical decisions?: results of a national survey [^10aa1dfc]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

Importance

Informing and involving patients in their medical decisions is increasingly becoming a standard for good medical care, particularly for primary care physicians.

Objective

To learn how patients describe the decision-making process for 10 common medical decisions, including 6 that are most often made in primary care.

Design

A survey of a national sample of adults 40 years or older who in the preceding 2 years had either experienced or discussed with a health care provider 1 or more of 10 decisions: medication for hypertension, elevated cholesterol, or depression; screening for breast, prostate, or colon cancer; knee or hip replacement for osteoarthritis, or surgery for cataract or low back pain.

Setting

Adults living in households in the United States in 2011.

Participants

A national sample of adults drawn from a probability sample-based web panel developed by Knowledge Networks.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Patients' perceptions of the extent to which the pros and cons were discussed with their health care providers, whether the patients were told they had a choice, and whether the patients were asked for their input.

Results

Responses were obtained from 2718 patients, with a response rate of 58.3%. Respondents reported much more discussion of the pros than the cons of all tests or treatments; discussions about the surgical procedures tended to be more balanced than those about medications to reduce cardiac risks and cancer screening. Most patients (60%-78%) said they were asked for input for all but 3 decisions: medications for hypertension and elevated cholesterol and having mammograms (37.3%-42.7%). Overall, the reported decision-making processes were most patient centered for back or knee replacement surgery and least for breast and prostate cancer screening.

Conclusions and Relevance

Discussions about these common tests, medications, and procedures as reported by patients do not reflect a high level of shared decision making, particularly for 5 decisions most often made in primary care.

### Do patients with gastrointestinal cancer want to decide where they have tests and surgery? A questionnaire study of provider choice [^459b2086]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2016). Medium credibility.

Backgrounds

Choice of provider has been an important strategy among policy makers, intended, in part, to drive improvements in quality and efficiency of healthcare. This study examined the information requirements, and decision-making experiences and preferences of patients who have had surgery for gastrointestinal cancer, to assess the status of provider choice in current practice.

Methods

The single-item Control Preferences Scale was used to determine patients' experiences and preferences when being referred for tests, and choosing where to have surgery. Participants used a Likert scale to rate the importance of 23 information items covering a variety of structures, processes and outcomes at the hospital level and the department level. Participants were recruited by post and online.

Results

463 responses were analysed. Patients reported very low levels of involvement in provider choice, with their doctor deciding where they underwent tests or surgery in 77.0% and 81.8% of cases, respectively. Over two-thirds of participants would have preferred greater involvement in provider choice than they experienced. Of note, patient age and education were not associated with reported preferences. Information on how long patients with cancer wait for treatment, annual operative volume and postoperative mortality rate, as well as retained foreign bodies and infection rates were considered very important.

Conclusions

There was a substantial unmet desire for greater involvement in provider choice among study participants. Respondents attached particular importance to surgery-specific information. Efforts should be made to increase involvement of patients with gastrointestinal cancer in provider decisions, across primary and secondary care, to deliver more patient-centred care. The reported lack of patient involvement in provider choice suggests it is unlikely to be working as an effective lever to drive quality improvement at present.

### Change in healthcare utilisation after surgical treatment: observational study of routinely collected patient data from primary and secondary care [^e7fa8f08]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The principal finding of this study is that patients at high risk of death after surgery experience large and persistent increase in healthcare utilisation in the 2 yr after surgery, even if they survive the immediate perioperative period. Most increase in healthcare use occurred in the first 6 months after surgery and a new, higher baseline is typically established around 1 yr after surgery. Increased age, long-term disease, and emergency surgical procedures are associated with more healthcare use at all time points. Although the greatest relative increase in healthcare use is in secondary care settings, most healthcare contacts were in primary care both before and after surgery.

Most prior studies of surgical outcomes focus on immediate complications and death after surgery, but few have described how the trajectory of healthcare use changes in the years after surgery. We compared data before and after surgery, including information from primary and secondary care. Most patients have a modest increase in healthcare use after surgery, but for certain patient groups the need for surgery reflects a transition point towards a much higher healthcare use. Trends in healthcare contact increase in the 6 months before surgery and peak in the 6 months after surgery. This broadly aligns with prior reports have suggested that unplanned readmissions persist throughout the first 3 months after surgery.A new, higher baseline of healthcare use is established around 1 yr after surgery. This new baseline would suggest that the increase in healthcare use resolves around 1 yr after surgery among survivors, and that this period is a suitable window to capture postoperative harms associated with surgery. Emergency surgery is associated with greater healthcare use immediately before and after surgery, and a greater healthcare need after surgery among survivors. Our findings add to the body of evidence regarding the poor short- and long-term outcomes experienced by high-risk surgical patients.,, An important difference between our study and others of the high-risk population is the definition of high-risk patients. Most prior studies used a cut-off, based on the risk of death associated with procedures. We created a simple risk model and used this to estimate risk for everyone in the dataset. We identified patients accounting for 80% of all deaths after surgery; these accounted for 11.7% of elective procedures and 24.3% of emergency procedures. This definition is highly reproducible and transferable, with the exact cut-off considered high-risk varying depending on the setting, while still accounting for the distribution of deaths. This can be repeatedly updated to account for temporal improvements in outcomes. In both elective and emergency settings, high-risk patients were older with a higher burden of long-term disease, with twice as many days in contact with healthcare before surgery as low-risk surgical patients. Our findings are consistent with previous reports of associations between higher preoperative healthcare use and poor patient outcomes.By 2 yr after surgery, low-risk patients had one further day in contact with healthcare, whereas high-risk patients had an increase of 10 days. High-risk patients have greater healthcare use before surgery but experience a disproportionate increase which persists after the immediate postoperative period. These findings have important implications for shared decision-making. Although there is much focus on the risk of early death after surgery, our findings would suggest that there are persistent changes in healthcare use among those who survive the immediate postoperative period. For high-risk surgical patients, this may represent a substantial increase in time spent with healthcare. In addition to this, there are likely wider costs to patients associated with increased healthcare encounters, such as need for transport, reduced opportunity for employment, and less time to spend with family or friends. More broadly, we anticipate that patients with higher healthcare use likely have lower quality of life, although this was beyond the scope of the present study.

The process of informed consent and shared decision-making—The page states that “The informed-consent process includes a frank and transparent discussion between surgeon and patient (and when the patient is a minor, the family)” describing the proposed treatment and alternatives while families demonstrate understanding of clinical and quality-of-life impacts; it adds, “The process requires the physician to determine, with clarity, where the proposed intervention resides along the spectrum between clinical care and research,” and, “If there is any question that a procedure might best be offered under a research protocol, even if the intent is to treat the patient, the surgeon should seek an IRB opinion.” The application process “requires an objective assessment of any real or perceived conflicts of interest” and such conflicts “must be addressed directly and candidly with the patient and parents or legal guardian during the consenting process.” Oversight “should be the responsibility of a small leadership group” with relevant expertise, potentially including “a clinical ethicist.” For innovative procedures, “it is appropriate for the surgeon to report his or her personal experience, including case volumes and patient outcomes.” Because “the physician, patient, and family can be vulnerable to ‘optimism bias,’ which is an unwarranted belief in the effectiveness of new therapies,” the article advises that “consideration should be given to the participation of an objective third party while obtaining consent.”

### Collaborative care: models for treatment of patients with complex medical-psychiatric conditions [^6a1164aa]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2014). Low credibility.

Developing Your Integrated Service

One of the aims of this article is to help individual practices and practitioners to implement or accelerate their collaborative/integrated approach to patient care. In order to develop an integrated/collaborative care service to suit your local population, you will first need to understand the population you are serving and the existing pathways to care. This will include an understanding of the determinants of health, the legal framework in which you practice, the range of third sector or non-government organisations available in your area and the provision delivered by existing secondary care providers. (See Fig. 14).

Fig. 14 
Collaborative mental health care – a schema

There will need to be a business model and a project plan with clear time lines including the skill mix and workforce necessary (such as doctors, nurses, psychologists, health care assistants, etc.) to deliver the model. It is important to recognise that some of the tasks currently undertaken by clinicians can be done by others of varying grades. For example, rather than trained nurses, navigators may be able to deliver care co-ordination. You have to deal with physical and mental health conditions together, as part of a stepped care approach [•,–].

Collaborative/integrated care requires accountability from all the organisations involved in the partnership or collaboration. It requires clear clinical leadership and a methodology for information sharing. It is important to support this through a clear methodology of payments or incentives that are clearly established and understood before the project begins. This forms the foundation for effective collaboration/integration.

There are some specific tasks that need to take place in primary care. These will include training staff in patient presentation, assessment and diagnosis. Once diagnosis is made it should be entered onto the practice disease register. There is also a need to train staff to stratify patients based on the risk and seriousness of their condition so that they can be directed to the right level of resources as early as possible.

Primary care interventions need to be supported by an agreed clinical protocol and guideline, and it is often better to adopt a stepped care approach. Clinical protocols and guidelines should also include a clear statement of when to refer to secondary care and when secondary care should discharge back to primary care.

### Surgical pathology and the patient: a systematic review evaluating the primary audience of pathology reports [^cd5bd7f7]. Human Pathology (2014). Low credibility.

The pathology report is a critical document that helps guide the management of patients with cancer. More and more patients read their reports, intending to participate in decisions about their care. However, a substantial subset of patients may lack the ability to comprehend this often technical and complex document. We hypothesized that most literature on pathology reports discusses reports from the perspective of other physicians and not from the perspective of patients. An expert panel of physicians developed a list of search criteria, which we used to identify articles on PubMed, MEDLINE, Cochrane Reviews, and Google Scholar databases. Two reviewers independently evaluated all articles to identify for detailed review those that met search criteria. We identified the primary audience of the selected articles and the degree to which these articles addressed clarity of communication of pathology reports with patients. Of 801 articles identified in our search, 25 involved the formatting of pathology reports for clarity of communication. Recurrent themes in proposed improvements in reports included content standardization, variation in terminology, clarity of communication, and quality improvement. No articles discussed patients as their target audience. No study evaluated the health literacy level required of patients to comprehend pathology reports. In summary, there is a scarcity of patient-centered approaches to improve pathology reports. The literature on pathology reports does not include patients as a target audience. Limited resources are available to help patients comprehend their reports. Efforts to improve patient-centered communication are desirable to address this overlooked aspect of patient care.

### Stratified care versus usual care for management of patients presenting with sciatica in primary care (SCOPiC): a randomised controlled trial [^9e6f99fd]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

Added value of this study

Before this trial, a UK Spinal Taskforce in 2013 highlighted the need for better information about the clinical and cost-effectiveness of early referral of patients with severe symptoms of sciatica for consideration of secondary care treatments such as surgery or spinal injections. The findings of this trial provide the first evidence about the clinical and cost-effectiveness of stratified care, including a fast-track pathway, for patients consulting in primary care with sciatica.

Implications of all the available evidence

In a primary care setting, where most patients with sciatica are assessed and managed, our findings do not support a transition from the mainly stepped care model to this stratified care model. However, testing ways to deliver care systematically to patients with sciatica could help to reduce practice variation. Taking into account that the key prognostic factors relevant in non-specific low back pain are not consistent prognostic factors in sciatica, further research is needed to explore different stratified care models for this population.

### Primary open-angle glaucoma preferred practice pattern ® [^b32775cb]. Ophthalmology (2021). High credibility.

Appendix 1—quality of ophthalmic care core criteria—describes attributes of quality ophthalmic care, stating that the ophthalmologist strives to develop and maintain clinical skills at the highest feasible level and ensures that needy patients receive necessary care directly or through referral while supporting activities that promote health and prevent disease and disability. It emphasizes that the ophthalmologist respects the dignity and integrity of his or her patients and does not exploit their vulnerability. The essence of quality care is a meaningful partnership relationship between patient and physician in which the ophthalmologist strives to communicate effectively, listening carefully to needs and concerns, and in turn educates patients about the nature and prognosis of their condition and about proper and appropriate therapeutic modalities. The ophthalmologist uses his or her best judgment in choosing and timing appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic modalities as well as the frequency of evaluation and follow-up, with due regard to the urgency and nature of the patient's condition and unique needs and desires. The ophthalmologist carries out only those procedures for which he or she is adequately trained, experienced, and competent, or, when necessary, is assisted by someone who is, depending on the urgency of the problem and availability and accessibility of alternative providers. Patients are afforded access and continuity through care that treats patients with due regard to timeliness, appropriateness, and the ophthalmologist’s own ability to provide such care, with adequate provision for appropriate pre- and postoperative patient care, provision of appropriate alternate ophthalmic care when the ophthalmologist is unavailable with adequate mechanisms for informing patients of its existence and procedures for obtaining it, and referral to other ophthalmologists and eye care providers based on the timeliness and appropriateness of such referral, the patient's needs, the competence and qualifications of the person to whom the referral is made, and access and availability.

### Optimizing the orthopaedic consult [^7c88e78f]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2022). Medium credibility.

Providing orthopaedic call coverage is a core requirement for orthopaedic surgery residents. Developing proper call habits and routines during residency is critical to becoming an attending surgeon who provides high-quality call coverage and consultations without difficulty. Although patient acuity and call duration and frequency may vary among rotations and hospitals, the fundamentals remain the same. Because personal health and content knowledge are critical for success, physical and mental preparation is done in advance. Using a stepwise approach for answering calls, taking a history, performing a physical examination, interpreting studies, and performing procedures can improve the quality and efficiency of patient care. Standard practices can be used to improve the process of scheduling urgent and emergent surgery or establishing outpatient follow-up. When the complexity or volume of patient care exceeds one's capabilities, it is critical to know when and how to ask for help. Clear communication is essential for safe and effective transitions of care and when presenting patients to attending surgeons. A call shift can also serve as a learning experience by reading on topics as each consult is completed, teaching others, and following up on patient outcomes after the call shift.

### Generalizability of systematic reviews of the effectiveness of health care interventions to primary health care: concepts, methods and future research [^0482ebb3]. Family Practice (2012). Low credibility.

Background

There is a push to make clinical decision making more evidence based and patient oriented. However, current systematic reviews are limited by the lack of consideration of generalizability.

Objective

To develop a guide for investigators (systematic reviewers) on how to adapt the methodology of a systematic review to facilitate the exploration of the results to primary care.

Methods

We reviewed the method guidelines of five organizations and working groups. Then, we conducted a search of literature in PubMed for articles on external validity of systematic. Based on the literature, we developed general steps to incorporate generalizability in systematic reviews and then integrated main primary care themes as outlined in WONCA definition of primary care and the definition of person-centred medicine across those steps.

Results

We identified a wide variety of approaches to address the issue of generalizability in systematic reviews. We extracted four major primary care themes from the two definitions of primary care and person-centred medicine that we mapped across the methods of generalizability. We suggested a two-step approach: Step 1 planning the scope of a review using four-layer schematic model and Step 2 to follow four steps to incorporate the concept of generalizability to primary care in the review.

Conclusions

Systematic reviewers can take several steps to improve the generalizability of their review to primary care. However, more research is needed to determine which approach provides better results than others.

### Specialist and primary care physicians' views on barriers to adequate preparation of patients for renal replacement therapy: a qualitative study [^6b4b6f24]. BMC Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Patients’ low perceived urgency for RRT preparation

Many nephrology providers believed that because patients are typically asymptomatic prior to the need for RRT initiation, patients feel that preparation is “really not that imperative”. Some nephrology providers reflected that, due to this perceived lack of urgency, many patients don’t complete the steps to prepare for RRT in a timely fashion, including non-compliance with surgical visits for vascular access and/or educational classes. One nephrology provider stated:

“The other thing that’s difficult is people that say I’m just going to wait until I’m sick; I feel fine now. Trying to get them to agree…to choose a modality and then make the preparations in advance is very difficult.”(Physician Assistant)

Additionally, some nephrology providers described that patients were concerned that early preparation may lead them to initiate renal replacement therapy earlier than necessary. A provider commented:

“…people think if they prepare and get a fistula placed, they’re going to need dialysis sooner, like they’re on the track versus if they just avoid it maybe they won’t need it as soon.”(Physician Assistant)

Patients’ fear of dialysis

Many nephrology providers reported patients’ fear of dialysis as a challenge to optimal patient preparation. Nephrology providers related that many patients know someone (e.g. family, friends, or neighbors) who has been treated with dialysis and experienced a poor outcome. They relate that they feel patients are very concerned about experiencing a similar fate. A nephrology provider commented:

“…there seems to be this stigma attached to it that is once you start bringing up dialysis, it’s over. They may as well start getting their will together, and it’s just sort of a terminal pathway, and one thing I hear a lot is oh no, no, no because you know I knew this guy and I knew this woman who they went to dialysis, and a month later they were dead.”(Physician)

### Palliative care in acute care surgery: research challenges and opportunities [^73d0b841]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Palliative care includes effective communication, relief of suffering and symptom management with an underlying goal of improving the quality of life for patients with serious illness and their families. Best practice palliative care is delivered in parallel with life-sustaining or life-prolonging care. Palliative care affirms life and regards death as a normal process, intends neither to hasten death nor to postpone death and includes but is not limited to end-of-life care. Palliative care encompasses both primary palliative care (which can and should be incorporated into the practice of acute care surgery) and specialty palliative care (consultation with a fellowship-trained palliative care provider). Acute care surgeons routinely care for individuals who may benefit from palliative care. Patients exposed to traumatic injury, emergency surgical conditions, major burns and/or critical surgical illness are more likely to be experiencing a serious illness than other hospitalized patients. Palliative care research is urgently needed in acute care surgery. At present, minimal high-quality research is available to guide selection of palliative care interventions. This narrative review summarizes the current state of research challenges and opportunities to address palliative care in acute care surgery. Palliative care research in acute care surgery can rely on either primary data collection or secondary and administrative data. Each approach has its advantages and limitations, which we will review in this article.

### The evidence-based preoperative assessment for the otolaryngologist [^1bf5657b]. The Laryngoscope (2020). Medium credibility.

There is a narrow window of opportunity between surgical scheduling and the operative date to optimize patients for an elective surgical procedure. Traditionally, preoperative care has involved extended routine testing batteries with intermittent referrals for medical clearance. These traditions are costly, inefficient, and yield no clear reduction in perioperative morbidity and mortality. Evidence, which has evolved over the past decade, suggests that optimal preoperative care requires a patient-centric, personalized, and often multidisciplinary approach. We present an up-to-date overview of this literature with a focus on the otolaryngologic surgical population. An algorithmic approach to preoperative patient assessment is also proposed in hopes of both optimizing patient outcome and streamlining routine clinical workflow. Laryngoscope, 130:38-44, 2020.

### Guidelines for psychological practice with transgender and gender nonconforming people [^5e89eb17]. The American Psychologist (2015). Medium credibility.

Guideline 14—interdisciplinary collaboration for transgender and gender nonconforming (TGNC) people states that psychologists “recognize the potential benefits of an interdisciplinary approach when providing care to TGNC people and strive to work collaboratively with other providers.” The guideline explains that “the challenges of living with a stigmatized identity and the need of many TGNC people to transition, socially and/or medically, may call for the involvement of health professionals from various disciplines, including psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers, primary health care providers, endocrinologists, nurses, pharmacists, surgeons,” and further includes “gynecologists, urologists, electrologists, speech therapists, physical therapists, pastoral counselors and chaplains, and career or educational counselors.” Application guidance notes collaboration “may take many forms and should occur in a timely manner that does not complicate access to needed services,” such as coordinating with medical and psychiatric providers when “testosterone can have an activating effect, in addition to treating gender dysphoria,” creating documentation to access “gender-affirming medical interventions,” and offering “support, information, and education to interdisciplinary colleagues” to help patients obtain “TGNC-affirmative care.” Practical steps around surgery preparation include contact that “could include sharing general information about her life history” and planning “appropriate health checks,” and collaboration with prescribers can involve “educating TGNC people and ensuring TGNC people are able to make fully informed decisions prior to starting hormone treatment.”

### Preoperative risk stratification: who needs medical consultation? [^4380c88b]. Spine (2020). Medium credibility.

Study Design

Spine update.

Objective

The purpose of this study is to provide a review of preoperative clearance and optimization, before elective spine surgery.

Summary Of Background Data

Patient optimization preceding elective surgery is critical to ensure the best possible outcome.

Methods

Historical and current literature pertaining to patient clearance and optimization, before elective surgery, was reviewed. These data were then synthesized and assessed to provide a balanced view on current trends in regards to preoperative management and optimization.

Results

The American Academy of Cardiology defines spine surgery as "intermediate" risk, and thus patients are permitted to forgo formal cardiac evaluation if they have no active cardiac condition and demonstrate adequate functional capacity; however, those with active or chronic medical conditions require further investigation before elective operations.

Conclusion

Overall, preoperative screening and optimization of comorbidities are vital to ensure positive outcomes in elective spine surgery, and the aforementioned criteria must be considered on an individual basis. Further research into specific preoperative optimization guidelines would help to ensure successful outcomes for those undergoing spine surgery.

### Pre-assessment surgical screening clinics provide a safe and equitable alternative to primary care evaluation in total joint arthroplasty [^704b63b9]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Preoperative medical clearance for total joint arthroplasty is valuable for identifying factors that could mitigate complication risks. Traditionally, preoperative clearance is obtained through a primary care provider (PCP). Literature has shown that Pre-Assessment Surgical Screening (PASS) clinics may enhance operating room efficiency, decrease surgical cancellations, reduce hospital costs, and improve patient care quality. The goal of this study was to compare 90-day surgical complication and cancellation rates between patients who received preoperative evaluation through a PASS clinic versus a PCP.

Methods

This retrospective study included patients who underwent primary total joint arthroplasty from January 2017 through January 2024 at a single high-volume joint arthroplasty institute. There were 17,515 patients who met inclusion criteria; 52.3% (n = 9,164) were preoperatively evaluated by the PASS program and 47.7% (n = 8,351) by a PCP. Patient demographics, health characteristics, surgical cancellations, and 90-day complications were collected from patient charts. Outcomes were compared between patients who underwent PCP clearance versus PASS clearance utilizing univariate and logistic regression analyses.

Results

On average, patients assessed by the PASS program were older (67 versus 66 years, P = 0.01), had a higher Charlson Comorbidity Index (P ≤ 0.01), and higher American Society of Anesthesiologists scores (P ≤ 0.01). Patients evaluated by a PCP were two times more likely to experience postoperative cardiac arrhythmia (odds ratio [OR]: 1.96; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.08 to 3.57; P = 0.03) and wound dehiscence (OR: 1.89; 95% CI: 1.04 to 3.45; P = 0.04). Patients evaluated by the PASS clinic were also 1.5 times more likely to experience periprosthetic joint infection (OR: 1.56; 95% CI: 1.08 to 2.25; P = 0.2). There was no significant difference in readmissions, total 90-day complications, or cancellations between the groups.

Conclusions

Patients evaluated by the PASS clinic presented with more comorbidities than patients evaluated by a PCP. Despite these baseline differences, total complications, readmission, and cancellation rates did not significantly differ. Preoperative evaluation clinics can be a helpful resource for mitigating surgical cancellations, postoperative complications, and readmissions in high-risk patient groups.

### Technical considerations and avoiding complications in total hip arthroplasty [^3702928f]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Preoperative Assessment

Preoperative screening and preoperative optimization increase the chance of a successful surgery.Implementing standardized preoperative optimization protocols reduces 90-day cost of care to patients. Medical clearance from a primary care provider and any needed specialists reduces the risk of postoperative complications such as surgical site infections (SSIs), reduced length of stays, and rehospitalizations. Treating underlying malnutrition, attaining a hemoglobin A1c of less than 7.5%, treating anemia, and smoking cessation all can decrease length of stay, readmission, and total cost of care to each patients.Research has indicated that elevated hemoglobin A1c levels and hyperglycemia can predispose patients to prosthetic joint infections, with A1c levels more than 7.5 causing marked increases in the risk of these infections. Patients with controlled diabetes (hemoglobin A1c <7.5%) have similar rates of complications as those without diabetes.Follow-up and re-evaluation is needed to ensure that these modifiable risk factors are being treated appropriately.

Technical preparation is important to avoid complications and provide a plan to restore leg lengths and offset as well as implant positioning.A thorough history and physical examination with radiographic templating (Figure 1) allows the surgeon to plan for unique aspects of the upcoming procedure. Planning for implant removal, deformity correction, the surgical approach, and ensuring the correct implants are available can be done before surgery to decrease surgical time and provide the most appropriate implant for the patient.An increase in surgical time can increase infection risk on an incremental basis.This imaging (Figure 1) allows the surgeon to assess leg lengths, offset, the quality of bone stock and morphology of the acetabulum, and the likely positioning of the implants and can usually predict the implant size within 1 to 2 increments.

Figure 1 
Template AP pelvic radiograph shows superior migration of the femoral head in (A), and the template in (B) shows the plan to restore the leg length and offset.

Preventing three common indications for revision arthroplasty (dislocation, aseptic loosening, and adverse local tissue reactions [ATLRs]) takes place preoperatively with templating, selecting appropriately sized implants, optimizing leg length and offset, and choosing appropriate bearing surfaces.

### NICE-accredited commissioning guidance for weight assessment and management clinics: a model for a specialist multidisciplinary team approach for people with severe obesity [^51e22e34]. Obesity Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Despite increasing prevalence of obesity, no country has successfully implemented comprehensive pathways to provide advice to all the severely obese patients that seek treatment. We aimed to formulate pathways for referral into and out of weight assessment and management clinics (WAMCs) that include internal medicine/primary care physicians as part of a multidisciplinary team that could provide specialist advice and interventions, including referral for bariatric surgery. Using a National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE)-accredited process, a Guidance Development Group conducted a literature search identifying existing WAMCs. As very few examples of effective structures and clinical pathways existed, the current evidence base for optimal assessment and management of bariatric surgery patients was used to reach a consensus. The model we describe could be adopted internationally by health services to manage severely obese patients.

### APHON / ASPHO policy statement for the transition of patients with sickle cell disease from pediatric to adult health care [^3498d3ca]. Journal of Pediatric Oncology Nursing (2015). Medium credibility.

Transfer of care for sickle cell disease—pediatric care providers should identify local adult care providers who have expertise or an interest in SCD; if the transition includes a transfer of care, it is helpful to have the family meet the adult care provider prior to the transfer because taking this step may improve the patient’s access and adherence to adult care; pediatric care providers should consider staggering the transfer so that patients are not changing primary care and subspecialty providers at the same time; the transfer should occur when the patient, family, and providers agree that the patient is ready to take on an adult role in their care, with a policy exception developed if a hospital has set a specific age for transfer for patients with cognitive delay or other special needs; transfers should be planned and an abrupt transfer should be avoided; and pediatric care providers should communicate directly with the adult care provider and send a written medical summary including the patient’s medical history, baseline laboratory test results, and an individualized pain management plan.

### How giving and receiving information has shaped my cancer journey [^9dcbaf33]. Annals of Family Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

I have been a nurse for 40 years and I now have metastatic breast cancer. I have learned a lot, especially about giving bad news, disclosing the diagnosis to others, and using the hospital's patient portal. First, how bad news is given to patients is important and should provide clear next steps for follow-up and treatment. Second, telling family, friends, and colleagues about a new cancer diagnosis is more challenging than you might expect. It is emotionally draining and time consuming, and support by primary care clinicians (PCCs) could make a difference. Finally, patient portals can be very beneficial, but their use in a complex diagnostic process like metastatic cancer can be problematic. Primary care clinicians should explicitly discuss use of portals with patients so that they receive the information they need in the way they want.

### Recognition of skin malignancy by general practitioners: observational study using data from a population-based randomised controlled trial [^c09aa454]. British Journal of Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

The 1990 contract was changed in 2004 so that there are stringent standards in place for those wishing to become general practitioners with a special interest in dermatology. However, these individuals, analogous to the ‘skin cancer clinic doctors’ in the study by, are not sufficient in number to undertake the assessment of all minor skin lesions presenting in primary care, and hospital services do not have the capacity either. GPs who merely wish to be added to the minor surgery list now have to be signed off by their trainer as competent, competent, but standards are set locally. Clinical guidelines issued by NICE make recommendations for referral of patients with suspected cancer from primary care to specialist services. These guidelines recommend that patients presenting with skin lesions suggestive of skin cancer, or in whom a biopsy has been confirmed, should be referred to a team specialising in skin cancer. However, it is not clear what will happen if GPs do not suspect that a lesion is cancerous, as in one-third of the malignancies in this study.

These results place an important ‘health warning’ around the assumption that shifting services from secondary care to primary care carries only benefits. There is not the capacity in hospitals to take on the workload of minor surgery or even of mere diagnosis of all skin lesions, and it would likely be unpopular with patients if it were to happen. We do not believe that the background of a doctor in general practice, surgery or even dermatology is fundamentally important, but we do believe that it is unsafe to leave the diagnosis and treatment of potential skin cancer entirely in the hands of doctors who have had insufficient training to do it. The increased costs associated with developing and delivering appropriate training to all GPs, not just for those with a specialist interest, must be acknowledged and provided.

### Effects of structured intraoperative briefings on patient outcomes: multicentre before-and-after study [^578d39ce]. The British Journal of Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design and participants

A multicentre before-and-after study was undertaken in four Swiss hospital departments (2 university hospitals, and two non-university referral centres). A 9-month baseline period without intervention was followed by an introductory period of 1 month, and then a 9-month intervention period during which the StOP? protocol was used during operations. During the introductory period, the StOP? protocol was explained and discussed in meetings with surgeons, nurses, and anaesthetists, and interviews were conducted with responsible surgeons to discuss when the protocol would be best employed in their specific types of surgery. In addition, trained observers attended operations, so that questions could be discussed; they also gave feedback to the surgeons. The study start date was staggered over time in the four hospitals to allow sufficient time for the team to prepare and introduce the intervention in each centre (centre 1: 1 May 2015 to 30 November 2016; centres 2 and 3: 1 September 2015 to 31 March 2017; centre 4: 1 September 2016 to 31 March 2018).

The study population included all operations carried out in the participating departments by surgeons of these departments. All participating departments performed abdominal surgery; however, some departments covered a wider range of operations, and these were also included (Table 1). Exclusion criteria were: patient age below 18 years, existing SSI, previous surgery at the same surgical site within the past 30 days, outpatient procedures not requiring general anaesthesia, and proctological surgery. The responsible surgeon was always board-certified. The study was approved by the ethical committees (leading committee: #161/2014). In three centres, inclusion was based on patient general consent; in the fourth, the local ethical committee waived explicit patient consent, and allowed inclusion of patients who did not refuse the use of their data. The study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02428179).

Table 1 
Patient and surgical characteristics for all operations and separately for baseline, intervention, and intervention with documented StOP? periods

Study procedure

The intervention entailed structured intraoperative briefings (in addition to the already established WHO checklist) during surgical procedures. To undertake the StOP? protocol, the responsible surgeon summoned all team members present in the operating room and informed them in a loud and clear voice about the current status of the operation (Status), about next steps and proximal objectives (Objectives), and about potential upcoming problems (Problems), and then encouraged team members to voice their observations or to ask questions (?).

### Assessing the value of preoperative medical clearance in patients with primary rhegmatogenous retinal detachment [^eec932ba]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2019). Medium credibility.

This study found that among all comorbidities considered, only a history of chronic heart failure was associated with increased risk of complications. This is in contrast to the Shalwala et al study in which CAD, asthma, and chronic renal failure were associated with increased postoperative systemic complications.In both the current study and the prior study, use of general anesthesia was associated with increased complications. Based on these findings, physicians may consider these risk factors and balance them with the risk to vision with delay in surgery when discussing the option of prompt surgery versus delayed surgery (to enable formal medical clearance) in patients undergoing primary RRD repair.

The standard limitations of retrospective, observational studies apply to this study. In addition, the small sample size and resulting low power (of note, the chi-squared test used had a power of 0.16 to detect a difference of 12% in complication rates between cases with or without preoperative clearance), as well as the tertiary care setting of this study may limit the generalizability of these findings. Nevertheless, the higher rate of primary RRD cases observed in male patients than in female patients in our study is consistent with the higher overall incidence of RRD seen in male patients in many previous large epidemiological studies.–In addition, as in prior studies,–,–the rate of RRD increased with increasing age in this study population. Finally, the described frequency of macula-off RRDs (60%) in this study is consistent with the previously reported macula-off rates ranging from 40% to 60% in Western studies.Cumulatively, this suggests that, despite the limited sample size, the current study population appears representative of the larger populations of RRD previously studied. Finally, due to the low rate of complications and the small sample size of this study, subgroup analyses of interest (for example, the utility of preoperative medical clearance according to baseline patient characteristics or surgery characteristics) were not possible. It is possible that although preoperative medical clearance did not reduce risk of complications in all primary RRD patients, those with certain systemic comorbidities or those undergoing general anesthesia may benefit from such evaluations. Caution must be taken before applying these findings to individual patients, especially those with significant medical comorbidities. Our results suggest, at best, that preoperative clearance by an independent provider may not be uniformly necessary. Future larger studies are necessary to determine the definitive value of preoperative clearance in primary RRD patients with and without medical comorbidities.

### Low back pain [^d68afcd0]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2012). Medium credibility.

Low back pain—psychological screening and referral: Clinicians should be aware of psychological and social factors that may be contributing to a patient's persistent pain and disability, and there should be standard processes so that clinicians screening for severe psychiatric distress have a clear indication of when referral for appropriate care is expected in a given clinical setting. An example of such a process can be made with the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders tool; a patient with a positive screening result for major or severe depressive symptoms should receive a focused clinical interview and should complete a full-length depressive symptom questionnaire (eg, Patient Health Questionnaire or Beck Depression Inventory). A referral to a mental healthcare provider is indicated to confirm a depression diagnosis if further indicated by interview and questionnaire and the patient is unaware of this, and an immediate assessment by a medical and/or mental health professional is indicated for safety reasons if the patient had a plan to harm himself/herself or others; a similar process could be used for other psychological symptoms (eg, anxiety).

### Preoperative surgical screening clinics provide a safe alternative to primary care physician screening prior to total shoulder arthroplasty [^ded79151]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Preoperative medical evaluation prior to total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) allows for the mitigation of risk factors to optimize surgical outcomes. Dedicated preoperative surgical clearance clinics, through streamlined protocols and interdisciplinary management, may allow for increased optimization prior to TSA. This study compares 90-day surgical complication and cancellation rates between TSA patients who received a preoperative evaluation from a Primary Care Physician (PCP) and those who received a preoperative evaluation from a Pre-Assessment Surgical Screening (PASS) clinic.

Methods

A retrospective review of a single-center acute care hospital was conducted for patients who underwent TSA between 2017 through 2024. Variables of interest included patient demographic information, medical comorbidities, surgical cancellation rate, and 90-day complications. Outcomes were compared between patients who underwent PCP versus PASS preoperative clearance utilizing univariate and logistic regression analyses.

Results

1,319 patients met inclusion criteria that comprised 696 (52.8%) and 606 (45.9%) patients evaluated preoperatively by a PCP and PASS clinic, respectively. Comparing PCP and PASS preoperative clinical pathways, there were no differences in patient demographics, medical comorbidities, surgical cancellations, or 90-day complication rates including prosthetic joint infection (PJI). In addition, there were no differences in the previous variables of interest among a subgroup analysis between anatomic (aTSA) and reverse (rTSA) total shoulder arthroplasty patients.

Discussion

We saw no differences in 90-day complications between preoperative evaluation from a PCP and a specialized screening clinic. Preoperative clinics may provide a safe, multidisciplinary, and streamlined approach for preoperative TSA patients, especially those who face challenges when scheduling an appointment with a PCP. However, the decision to receive preoperative evaluation for TSA from a PCP or a preoperative clinic may be influenced more by patient preference and convenience than by differences in clinical outcomes.

### Change in healthcare utilisation after surgical treatment: observational study of routinely collected patient data from primary and secondary care [^7dc9535a]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2022). Medium credibility.

Previous research suggests that the great majority of postoperative deaths occur in a sub-population undergoing high-risk surgical procedures. High-risk procedures are those with a 30-day risk of death exceeding 1 in 20, which account for around one in six inpatient procedures. This high-risk group account for 80% of deaths within 30 days after surgery.High-risk patients are typically older, with a high burden of chronic disease, and require emergency intra-abdominal operations. To date, most research on high-risk patients has focused on risk of death and complications in the immediate postoperative period. However, the long-term outcomes for high-risk patient groups remain poorly described, but important to understand for patients considering surgical treatments, and those planning their care. Around one in 15 patients require non-elective hospital admission in the year after surgery.However, this measure overlooks the wider context of healthcare delivery and fails to consider the pre-existing healthcare need patients have before surgery. Most patient care is delivered in the community by primary care physicians, or in hospital outpatient clinics, rather than on an inpatient basis. To date, no study has explored how the trajectory of healthcare use changes before and after surgery among surgical patients or explored the burden of both primary and secondary healthcare contacts.Burden of healthcare is a measure of days spent in contact with healthcare that reflects illness severity.There is evidence that high-risk patients who suffer complications will subsequently experience reduced long-term survival and quality of life.However, changes in other postoperative outcomes, such as quality of life and burden of healthcare need, are not well described for high-risk surgical patients.

There is a need for evidence describing long-term outcomes for high-risk surgical patients. This would inform decisions made by patients, clinicians, and health policymakers. We undertook a population-level analysis of routine primary and secondary care patient data. Our aim was to describe how the need for healthcare services change in the years after surgical treatment, in particular for patients who survive despite being at high risk of early death after surgery.

### Thirty-five years of acute pain services: where Do we Go from here? [^965bd4ce]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2020). Medium credibility.

Acute pain services (APS) have developed over the past 35 years. Originally implemented solely to care for patients with regional catheters or patient-controlled analgesia after surgery, APS have become providers of care throughout the perioperative period, with some institutions even taking the additional step toward providing outpatient services for patients with acute pain. Models vary considerably in terms of tasks and responsibilities, staffing, education, protocols, quality, and financing. Many challenges face today's APS, including the increasing number of patients with preexisting chronic pain, intake of analgesics and opioids before surgery, substance-dependent patients needing special care, shorter hospital stays, early discharge of patients in need of further analgesic treatment, prevention and treatment of chronic postsurgical pain, minimization of adverse events, and side effects of treatment. However, many APS lack a clear-cut definition of their structures, tasks, and quality. Development of APS in the future will require us to face urgent questions, such as, "What are meaningful outcome variables?" and, "How do we define high quality?" It is obvious that focusing exclusively on pain scores does not reflect the complexity of pain and recovery. A broader approach is needed-a common concept of surgical and anesthesiological services within a hospital (eg, procedure-specific patient pathways as indicated by the programs "enhanced recovery after surgery" or the "perioperative surgical home"), with patient-reported outcome measures as one central quality criterion. Pain-related functional impairment, treatment-induced side effects, speed of mobilization, as well as return to normal function and everyday activities are key.

### Primary care: the next renaissance [^1f7ac129]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Three decades ago, a renaissance helped create the foundations of primary care as we know it today. In recent years, however, new challenges have confronted primary care. We believe that the current challenges can be overcome and may, in fact, present an opportunity for a new renaissance of primary care to address the needs of our population. In this paper, we suggest seven core principles and a set of actions that will support a renaissance in, and a positive future for, primary care. The seven principles are 1) Health care must be organized to serve the needs of patients; 2) the goal of primary care systems should be the delivery of the highest-quality care as documented by measurable outcomes; 3) information and information systems are the backbone of the primary care process; 4) current health care systems must be reconstructed; 5) the health care financing system must support excellent primary care practice; 6) primary care education must be revitalized, with an emphasis on new delivery models and training in sites that deliver excellent primary care; and 7) the value of primary care practice must be continually improved, documented, and communicated. At the start of the 21st century, a vital, patient-centered primary care system has much to offer a rapidly changing population with increasingly diverse needs and expectations. If we keep the needs of persons and patients clearly in sight and design systems to meet those needs, primary care will thrive and our patients will be well served.

### SUNBURN: a protocol for delivering bad news in trauma and acute care surgery [^3f3f6584]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2022). Medium credibility.

SUNBURN protocol

The SUNBURN protocol provides a framework for the delivery of bad news in TRACS. This model can be used in guiding discussions with both family or the patients themselves depending on the circumstances. It is divided into seven steps:

Step 1: S–Set Up

Step 2: U–Understand Perceptions

Step 3: N–Notify (‘Warning Shot’)

Step 4: B–Brief Narrative and Break Bad News

Step 5: U–Understand Emotions

Step 6: R–Respond

Step 7: N–Next Steps

Step 1: S–Set Up

The first step in delivery of bad news is the set-up. Proper preparation can significantly influence the proceeding interactions. TRACS will frequently involve emotionally charged events that can be difficult for all those involved, including the providers giving care. A physician should take time to compose themselves prior to initiating the patient/family interaction. The details surrounding the precipitating event and clinical course should be reviewed and understood. Surgeons should then mentally prepare what they want to communicate prior to initiating the conversation. Being able to clearly and concisely convey information is necessary for proper communication.

Setting should also be considered in preparation. This includes a surgeon’s appearance. Blood-stained clothing can elicit needless distress and should be changed prior to the patient/family interaction. A quiet room should be selected to avoid distraction and allow total attention given to the discussions at hand. A safety strategy should also be considered. Although rare, all team members should have easy access to exit the physical space in the case of a violent reaction.

ACC/AHA algorithm—functional capacity and clinical risk factor pathway for non-low-risk surgery proceeds with Step 4 “Functional capacity ≥ 4 METs without symptoms?” where meeting this threshold permits “Proceed with planned surgery,” while if not or unknown go to Step 5 “Assess clinical risk factors.” With “No clinical risk factors,” proceed with planned surgery. With “1-2 clinical risk factors,” for “Intermediate-risk surgery” either “Proceed with planned surgery, with heart rate control for appropriate patients” or “Consider noninvasive cardiac testing if it will change management.” With “≥ 3 clinical risk factors,” “Consider noninvasive cardiac testing if it will change management.”

### Adapting elements of cleft care protocols in low-and middle-income countries during and after COVID-19: a process-driven review with recommendations [^7e64864d]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Focus Area 1: Surgical Safety

The primary focus of any healthcare protocol is to promote the safety of patients, their family and the healthcare providers. Following the inevitable delays in cleft care provision following COVID-19, the reinstatement of cleft services must be done safely and according to the latest available evidence. Many aspects of surgical safety were in place before the pandemic and for the most part, these would continue during or after the pandemic with some notable additions and considerations. Recommendations centered upon suggested additional adaptations to be considered during and after COVID-19 and have been categorized according to the period of operative care (pre, peri and post) as described in Table 2.

Table 2. 
Cleft Surgery Safety Measures That Were Routine Before COVID-19 and Specific Adaptations for Consideration During and After COVID-19.

Preoperative safety protocols exist to assess whether the patient is safe to proceed with a procedure and often incorporate a consultation and basic tests. Post-COVID-19, preoperative assessments need to be expanded to judge the risk of the virus causing harm to patients, families and providers. The extent of preoperative modifications (such as frequency of COVID-19 testing and the need for isolation strategies) can be adapted in response to regional COVID-19 prevalence, which has been classified as low (<0.5%), medium (0.5−2%) and high (>2%). Whilst an in-person consultation with the patient, surgeon and anesthetist remains vital, virtual screening for COVID-19 symptoms can be successfully utilized. COVID-19 testing, performed as close to the time of care as possible, is an important adaptation of the preoperative protocol, whilst recognizing the need for flexibility due to access to testing facilities. Establishing vaccination status is important but vaccine availability will likely be a challenge in LMICs due to global inequity and therefore an emphasis on PPE for patient, families and staff may be required (;).

Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2012). Medium credibility.

Screening for depression—Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2) uses two items asking whether in the past 12 months the patient had a time when they felt sad, blue, depressed, or down for most of the time for at least two weeks, and whether in the past 12 months there was a time, lasting at least two weeks, when they did not care about or enjoy usual things. If the patient answers YES to either question, then further evaluation by a primary care physician, geriatrician, or mental health specialist is recommended. This screening test has not been validated in extremely frail elderly patients, those with severe concurrent medical illnesses, those who are suffering from medication side effects, or those with impaired communication skills.

### A qualitative assessment of factors that children, parents, and clinicians prioritize in the setting of elective anesthesia and surgery [^a8d720c1]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Assessing the postoperative recovery of pediatric patients is challenging as there is no validated comprehensive patient-centered recovery assessment tool for this population. A qualitative investigative approach with in-depth stakeholder interviews can provide insight into the recovery process and inform the development of a comprehensive patient-centered postoperative assessment tool for children.

Methods

We conducted open-ended, semistructured interviews with children 6-12 years old undergoing elective surgery (n = 35), their parents (n = 37), and clinicians (n = 23) who commonly care for this population (nurses, anesthesiologists, and surgeons). A codebook was developed and analyzed using NVivo 12 Plus. The codebook was iteratively developed using a qualitative content analysis approach with modifications made throughout to refine codes. We report the results of this thematic analysis of patient, parent, and clinician transcripts.

Results

Postoperative recovery priorities/concerns overlapped and also diverged across the 3 groups. Topics prioritized by children included mobility and self-care, as well as access to a strong social support network following surgery. The majority of children reported feeling anxious about the surgery and separating from their parents, as well as sadness about their inability to participate in activities while recovering. Although children highly valued familial support during recovery, there was variable awareness of the impact of surgery on family members and support network. In contrast, parents focused on the importance of clear and open communication among themselves and the health care team and being equipped with appropriate knowledge and resources on discharge. The immediate repercussions of the child's surgery, such as pain, confusion, and nausea, appeared to be a primary focus of both parents and clinicians when describing recovery. Clinicians had a comprehensive awareness of the possible psychological impacts of surgery in children, while parents reported varying degrees of awareness or concern regarding longer-term or more latent impacts of surgery and anesthesia (eg, anxiety and depression). Prior experience with pediatric surgery emerged as a distinguishing characteristic for parents and clinicians as parents without prior experience expressed less understanding of or comfort with managing a child's recovery following surgery.

Conclusions

A patient-centered qualitative investigative approach yielded insights regarding the importance of various aspects of recovery in pediatric patients, their parents, and members of the health care team. Specifically, this investigation highlighted the importance of clear communication providing anticipatory guidance for families presenting for elective surgery in an effort to optimize patient recovery. This information will be used in the development of a patient-centered recovery assessment tool.

Recommendations

Question 17.1
Composition of the craniosynostosis expertise team Care for patients with craniosynostosis is provided from a multidisciplinary setting. A craniosynostosis specialist centre has at least the following health care providers and facilities:

Back up of the basic specialties (so at least 2 specialists for neurosurgery, plastic surgery, and oral surgery) is advised to ensure continuity of care. Collaboration within the craniosynostosis specialist centre:
Care for patients with craniosynostosis should be provided from a multidisciplinary setting. A care path must be established.
The team roles should be clearly defined.
Joint consultations are held with the presence of the core specialists (plastic surgery, oral surgery, and neurosurgery) and the availability of the other specialists. Collaboration outside the craniosynostosis expertise centre:
Patients with craniosynostosis are only treated in an accredited craniosynostosis expertise centre. Specific parts of the care program can be performed in your own region on request and under the coordination of the craniosynostosis expertise centre Task division within the craniosynostosis expertise centre: Care is provided on the basis of established protocols that are reviewed annually. The multidisciplinary care per individual patient is coordinated between the care providers and communicated to the patient and parents and any care providers from outside the team. A practitioner from a core specialty is the team leader. He or she is ultimately responsible for ensuring that the craniosynostosis expertise centre meets all criteria. The care coordinator (usually a nursing specialist) is responsible for coordinating care and is the point of contact for patients and cotreatment providers from outside the team. Centralization Care for nonsyndromic, unisutural craniosynostosis in the Netherlands is centrally provided in 2 craniosynostosis expertise centres. Care for syndromic craniosynostosis is centrally provided in 1 centre. The minimum number of intracranial operations (skull surgery) for craniosynostosis is 20 per surgeon per year. Reporting of results and activities An internal audit takes place at least once a year. This involves looking at the performance quality and the working methods of the craniosynostosis expertise team and any necessary improvement actions take place. Every craniosynostosis expert team issues an annual report:

### Primary care provider follow-up after surgery (...) [^4f58437f]. JAMA Network (2014). Excellent credibility.

At the time of discharge after high-risk surgery, patients are routinely counseled to follow-up with their primary care provider as well as the surgeon who performed their procedure. Aside from representing a tradition in surgical practice, patients and physicians presume that early follow-up with the PCP represents an opportunity to address problems that may emerge during the care transition from inpatient to outpatient settings. Early PCP follow-up after admission for high-risk medical conditions, such as heart failure or pneumonia, has been demonstrated1, 2 to lower the risk of hospital readmission, helping to validate this practice. However, the value added by a PCP visit after surgical discharge has been debated for several reasons. First, PCPs may believe that a visit after surgical discharge is unnecessary because issues arising soon after surgery are likely related to the operation and would be best addressed by the surgical team.

Our main exposure variable was patient evaluation by a PCP within 30 days of hospital discharge after elective open TAA repair and VHR. A PCP was defined as a health care worker who was not a member of the surgical team, which included primary care physicians as well as nurse practitioners and/or physician assistants. The PCP visit needed to occur before the date of any readmission. We included all evaluations by PCPs that were performed in an outpatient clinic setting as well as within the patient’s home. We hypothesize that for patients undergoing high-risk surgery, follow-up with PCPs is a means by which complications or errors in discharge planning can be recognized before they escalate into larger problems. For example, a minor surgical site infection could be diagnosed and treated early with antibiotics, or treatment with a critical medication that was omitted from the discharge instructions could be restarted before the patient experienced an adverse clinical event.

As our data show, most primary care follow-up occurred within 2 weeks after hospital discharge, allowing the opportunity for PCPs to implement these types of prophylactic measures in a clinic setting and avoid a preventable readmission. Routine follow-up with a PCP after high-risk surgery was associated with a lower likelihood of 30-day readmission, particularly among patients with a complicated postoperative course. This association was evident both in patient- and regional-level assessment of primary care integration in the discharge process, and patients at the highest risk for readmission appear to receive the greatest benefit from early outpatient primary care services. Low-risk surgical patients, however, may not receive a benefit from this routine practice. Ensuring primary care follow-up for high-risk surgical patients may be an effective, low-cost mechanism to limit readmissions.

### Impact of managing provider type on severe aortic stenosis management and mortality [^7d0c3da5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Among 6746 adults with newly diagnosed sAS, after adjustment for baseline patient characteristics and comorbidities, we found significantly lower rates of cardiac specialist follow‐up evaluation and AVR for patients managed by a PCP as compared with a cardiac specialist. PCP‐managed patients were less likely to undergo AVR even when the analysis was limited to patients with symptomatic sAS, which represents the most severe stage of sAS (Stage D) according to current 2020 ACC/AHA guidelines and for whom AVR is recommended with very few exceptions.PCP‐led management of sAS was also associated with higher risk of mortality, regardless of patients' symptom status.

Cardiac Specialist Follow‐Up and Aortic Valve Replacement

Primary care providers play a crucial role in patient care. Their initial clinical evaluation frequently is key to discovering underlying cardiovascular disease and it should be noted that 51% of cardiologist‐managed patients also saw a PCP in the year before echocardiogram confirmation of sAS. Meanwhile, follow‐up evaluation by a specialist provider represents an opportunity for in‐depth assessment of concerning findings by an expert in the field. Specialists usually receive years of additional training regarding identification and best practice management of diseases associated with their practice. A key component of this training is gaining familiarity with clinical management guidelines.According to current 2020 ACC/AHA guidelines, referral to a cardiac specialist is a critical step in the clinical management pathway for all patients with sAS (Class 1 recommendation, Level of Evidence: C).Evaluation by a cardiac specialist provides the best opportunity for accurate assessment of patient disease severity and symptomatology, although variability in the management of patients with sAS among cardiologists has been described.As the guidelines for sAS management are largely based on these findings, accurate characterization of a patient's clinical presentation is key to appropriate management and good outcomes. Visiting with a cardiac specialist may also empower patients to participate in fully informed decision‐making regarding their condition, as specialists may have greater experience with issues warranting consideration, such as the natural history of untreated sAS and AVR procedural risks.

### Internist diagnosis and management of chronic hepatitis B virus infection [^372f2808]. The American Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Chronic infection with the hepatitis B virus can lead to hepatocellular carcinoma and cirrhosis in up to 25% of infected individuals. As many as 2 million individuals in the US may have chronic hepatitis B infection, most of whom immigrated to the US from hepatitis B-endemic regions of the world. A 2010 report from the Institute of Medicine noted that two thirds of patients with hepatitis B are unaware of their infection, and most health care providers do not screen for hepatitis B or know how to manage hepatitis B-positive patients. In 2010, the Hepatitis B Foundation convened a group of primary care providers to consider the existing evidenced-based recommendations and strategies for implementation of hepatitis B screening into routine practice. The group designed an easy-to-use algorithm for screening, initial evaluation, ongoing management, and referral to a subspecialist when appropriate. Internal medicine specialists, including primary care providers and subspecialists, need to understand the steps they can take to address this often under-recognized disorder.

Palliative care—time-limited trial (TLT) initiation and team roles are outlined as follows: To proceed with a TLT, initiate the following steps: Define and communicate the patient’s clinical problems and prognoses; Clarify the patient’s personal values, goals of care, and quality of life priorities; Identify realistic objective markers that constitute clinical improvement or deterioration; Suggest and agree upon a time frame for reassessment and reevaluation; and Define clear expectations and the plan of action at the end of the TLT. Ideally, one or two providers take ownership of the TLT process to ensure smooth communication and build trust with the family, and the palliative care team can be effective in facilitating the TLT discussion and providing additional expertise in communication skills and bereavement support for families and providers.

### Implementation of a software-based decision support tool for guideline-appropriate preoperative evaluation: a prospective agreement study [^29a1fa60]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2024). Medium credibility.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was the decision to clear high-risk patients for surgery, using either the digital guideline support approach or the standard approach, with the decisions of an experienced anaesthetist. A digital guideline-supported decision to clear for surgery was classified as ‘correct’ if it agreed with the expert's decision. Accordingly, there were two modes of agreement: agreement to clear and agreement not to clear for surgery. Disagreements included ‘not followed’ recommendations or clearances when the expert had not done so and ‘wrongly rejected’ conditions when clearance for the operation was not given even though the expert had given it. Analogously, agreement or disagreement was decided for the standard approach. The agreement levels of both approaches were compared with the expert's decision.

Secondary outcomes were the agreement in more extensive preoperative examinations beyond physical examination, patient and drug history, such as ECG, echocardiography, non-invasive cardiac stress tests, pulmonary function tests, carotid Doppler, or various laboratory tests, which were requested at least once by the anaesthetist, the expert, or the digital guideline support tool.

Exploratory outcomes included the time needed for completing the preoperative evaluation, several postoperative complications, and the discharge dispositions.

Sample size consideration

For agreement studies, 200 observations were required to keep the confidence interval around the limits of agreement <0.25 standard deviations of the measurement differences.We included 204 patients, assuming a 2% loss to follow-up.

### CONSORT 2010 statement: extension to randomised pilot and feasibility trials [^eb35263e]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

- Item 3b

- Standard CONSORT item : important changes to methods after trial commencement (such as eligibility criteria), with reasons

- Extension for pilot trials : important changes to methods after pilot trial commencement (such as eligibility criteria), with reasons

- Example

“After randomly assigning 11 patients (5 to standard care), we recognized that patients assigned to standard care were receiving early surgery because, having achieved accelerated medical clearance, they were put on the operating room list. We therefore amended the protocol to randomly assign patients immediately on diagnosis; only those assigned to early surgery received an expedited medical assessment.”

- Explanation

Pilot trials are exploratory and so those conducting them should be able to modify the methods if a potential problem becomes apparent. In the case of Buse et al,the original protocol specified that patients had to have medical clearance for rapid surgery before randomisation, but this led to contamination of the control group as some patients in this group were put on the surgical list for rapid surgery (accelerated surgery was the intervention) because it had been ascertained that they were suitable candidates. In the revised protocol participants were randomised first and then assessed for suitability to accelerated access. Thus the pilot potentially improved the design of the trial that was to follow. It is important to document all changes and give reasons for the changes. The example describes changes to the timing of randomisation, but there might also be changes to other aspects of the trial, such as the treatment regimen, eligibility criteria, or outcome variables.
