## Question

Takotsubu cardiomyopathy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (Takotsubo syndrome). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the syndrome and its nomenclature. Then, I should verify the epidemiology and clinical presentation. Next, I will examine the pathophysiology, including catecholamine surge, microvascular dysfunction, and inflammation. After that, I need to review diagnostic criteria and the differential diagnosis, including imaging and biomarkers. I will then assess complications, prognosis, and recurrence. Finally, I should outline evidence-based management, special populations, and knowledge gaps, and close with a concise synthesis that ties these elements together with appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the definition and nomenclature so I don't mislabel the entity. Takotsubo syndrome (TTS), also called stress cardiomyopathy or broken-heart syndrome, is characterized by transient, reversible left ventricular dysfunction that mimics acute coronary syndrome but occurs without obstructive coronary artery disease; the name derives from the Japanese octopus trap that resembles the apical ballooning pattern seen on ventriculography, and consensus statements prefer "Takotsubo syndrome" to reflect its heterogeneous ventricular patterns and transient nature [^117Si4Ju] [^1133GYVa].

> I need to check the epidemiology and demographics carefully. TTS accounts for roughly 1–3% of suspected ACS presentations, with a strong female predominance around 90% and a mean age near the mid-60s; importantly, prevalence appears to be rising with increased recognition, and TTS may represent up to 10% of women presenting with suspected ACS in some series, which underscores the need to keep it high on the differential in the right clinical context [^113keiNn] [^116CsM6p].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about triggers; I should verify the distribution. Emotional stress is a classic trigger, but physical stressors are actually more common in registry cohorts, and a substantial minority have no identifiable trigger; physical triggers include surgery, sepsis, trauma, and neurologic events, while emotional triggers span grief, anger, and anxiety, and iatrogenic catecholamine excess can also precipitate TTS, so I need to ask broadly about stressors rather than assume an emotional cause [^115xuWSi] [^117Q3TWo] [^113GrJAp].

> Next, I should review the clinical presentation and make sure I capture the mimics. Patients typically present with chest pain, dyspnea, syncope, or even cardiac arrest; ECG changes include ST-segment elevation or depression, T-wave inversion, and QT prolongation, while troponin is modestly elevated and BNP or NT-proBNP is disproportionately high relative to troponin, which can help distinguish TTS from MI in the acute setting; I should double-check that these features are supportive but not diagnostic on their own [^115xuWSi] [^115nAVa6] [^113qy54s].

> I will now examine the pathophysiology, and I need to ensure I integrate multiple lines of evidence. The leading hypothesis remains catecholamine excess with sympathetic hyperactivation causing myocardial stunning; mechanistically, a beta2-adrenergic receptor–Gi signaling switch in cardiomyocytes can produce negative inotropy, particularly in the apex where beta-adrenergic density is higher, explaining apical ballooning; microvascular dysfunction and coronary vasospasm likely contribute, and emerging data implicate a maladaptive inflammatory response with M1-predominant macrophage infiltration that fails to resolve, linking acute injury to chronic sequelae; I should confirm that these mechanisms are not mutually exclusive and may coexist in different patients [^116sZt2v] [^114rcvcR] [^11765toA] [^115BmhPS].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic criteria before proposing a workup. The diagnosis remains one of exclusion; the Mayo Clinic criteria (revised 2008) and the InterTAK criteria are widely used and require transient regional wall motion abnormalities extending beyond a single coronary territory, absence of obstructive CAD or plaque rupture, new ECG abnormalities or modest troponin rise, and exclusion of pheochromocytoma and myocarditis; importantly, TTS can coexist with nonobstructive CAD, so I should not overcall CAD as the cause if the wall motion pattern is atypical for ischemia [^113QEQSK] [^113U4J2e] [^116ZRPsW].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic workup and imaging strategy, and I need to ensure I sequence tests appropriately. In STEMI-like presentations, urgent coronary angiography with left ventriculography is mandatory to exclude ACS; in NSTEMI-like presentations, the InterTAK score can stratify probability, with higher scores supporting TTS and prompting echocardiography to look for circumferential ballooning; echocardiography identifies typical patterns and complications such as LVOT obstruction, mitral regurgitation, right ventricular involvement, or thrombus; cardiac MRI helps differentiate TTS from myocarditis or MI by showing myocardial edema with absent or minimal late gadolinium enhancement and can reveal persistent abnormalities despite EF recovery; I should confirm that CMR is particularly useful when the diagnosis is uncertain or myocarditis is suspected [^115kt8rd] [^113grCCV] [^115NXZE8] [^1171FmVJ].

> I should double-check the biomarker patterns that aid differentiation. Troponin is elevated but typically modest relative to the extent of wall motion abnormality, whereas BNP or NT-proBNP is markedly elevated, yielding high BNP/troponin ratios that can help distinguish TTS from MI; however, these are supportive rather than definitive, so I must integrate them with imaging and clinical context [^115nAVa6] [^113qy54s].

> Let me consider complications and prognosis carefully, because I don't want to understate risk. In-hospital complications include cardiogenic shock, malignant ventricular arrhythmias including torsades de pointes, LV rupture, and thromboembolism; mortality during the index admission is around 2–4% in contemporary series, and long-term mortality approximates 3.5–5.6% per year, comparable to ACS; recurrence occurs in about 4–5% of survivors, and delayed recovery of LV function is associated with worse outcomes; I should confirm that physical triggers, low EF, neurologic disease, and atypical patterns portend higher risk [^115xuWSi] [^113TooB2] [^1119cf2T] [^112mwNbS].

> Hold on, I should verify the long-term sequelae because this changes follow-up. Despite normalization of EF in most patients, a substantial subset exhibits persistent symptoms, exercise intolerance, and evidence of a heart failure phenotype with impaired energetics and neurohormonal activation; rodent models demonstrate durable metabolic reprogramming and structural changes after a single stress event, supporting the concept that TTS can leave a lasting imprint even when EF "recovers" [^115NgZBS] [^113t1FcS] [^111a4Px7].

> Next, I should review management, and I need to emphasize that evidence is largely consensus-based. Acutely, treat as ACS until proven otherwise with aspirin, heparin, and supportive care; avoid inotropes if LVOT obstruction is present, and manage shock with beta-blockers, vasopressors, and mechanical support as needed; long-term, beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors or ARBs are reasonable to support recovery and mitigate neurohormonal activation, though randomized trial data are lacking; anticoagulation is indicated if LV thrombus is present or if severe LV dysfunction persists; I should confirm that management is individualized and that we avoid reflexively administering catecholamines in obstructive physiology [^1159eYNb] [^111bby3k].

> But wait, what if the trigger is endogenous catecholamine excess or a neurologic event; I need to ensure I address special populations. In pheochromocytoma-associated TTS, alpha-blockade and tumor-directed therapy are essential; in neurologic TTS, prioritize neurologic management and consider the role of autonomic dysregulation; in pregnancy and the peripartum period, TTS is rare but reported, and management should balance maternal-hemodynamic stability with fetal considerations; in COVID-19, cytokine storm and stress may trigger TTS, so supportive care and anticoagulation guidance follow general principles with attention to thrombosis risk [^116S6t6e] [^114tAfZP] [^116KTHhd] [^112cypMz].

> I should confirm recurrence risk and prevention strategies. Recurrence is around 4–5% and may involve different wall motion patterns; risk appears higher with physical triggers and possibly with psychiatric comorbidity, so addressing stress, anxiety, and depression is prudent; in patients requiring repeated ECT, prophylactic beta-blockade has been used to mitigate catecholamine surge, though data are limited; I need to ensure patients receive counseling about warning symptoms and maintain longitudinal follow-up given nontrivial late events [^1119cf2T] [^117Gxf9V] [^111JkUnb].

> Let me reconsider the key knowledge gaps so I don't overstate certainties. The absence of randomized trials limits therapeutic guidance; the precise mechanisms linking catecholamines, microvascular dysfunction, and inflammation remain to be defined; we lack robust biomarkers for rapid diagnosis; and optimal duration and intensity of neurohormonal therapy after recovery are unknown; emerging imaging and omics approaches, including CMR mapping, PET, and circulating miRNAs, may refine diagnosis and risk stratification, but validation is ongoing [^113keiNn] [^1151MSp3] [^113jcFf9].

> In summary, I need to ensure the synthesis remains clinically actionable. Takotsubo syndrome is a transient, reversible cardiomyopathy that mimics ACS but lacks obstructive CAD; it is common in older women and often follows physical stress; diagnosis relies on exclusion with supportive imaging and biomarker patterns; complications can be severe and long-term outcomes are not benign, warranting structured follow-up and risk-stratified therapy; management is supportive with beta-blockade and RAAS modulation, avoidance of harmful inotropes in obstruction, and targeted treatment of triggers; I should double-check that I've emphasized the need to suspect TTS in appropriate presentations and to avoid premature reassurance given meaningful morbidity and mortality [^115xuWSi] [^113QEQSK] [^1159eYNb].

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC), also known as stress cardiomyopathy or broken-heart syndrome, is a **transient, reversible left ventricular dysfunction** that mimics acute coronary syndrome (ACS) but occurs without obstructive coronary artery disease [^113keiNn]. It is most often triggered by intense emotional or physical stress and predominantly affects **postmenopausal women** [^115xuWSi]. Diagnosis relies on **coronary angiography** to exclude ACS, with supportive imaging (echocardiography, cardiac MRI) showing characteristic wall motion abnormalities (apical or mid-ventricular ballooning) and no significant late gadolinium enhancement [^115NXZE8]. Management is supportive, including beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, and anticoagulation if indicated; most patients recover within weeks, but complications such as cardiogenic shock, arrhythmias, and thromboembolism can occur, and recurrence is seen in about 4–5% [^1119cf2T] [^1112SyD8]. Long-term mortality is **comparable to ACS**, underscoring the need for follow-up and risk stratification [^115xuWSi] [^113TooB2].

---

## Pathophysiology

The exact mechanism remains incompletely understood; proposed mechanisms include:

- **Catecholamine surge**: Excess catecholamines cause direct myocyte toxicity, microvascular dysfunction, and metabolic impairment, leading to transient stunning [^116sZt2v] [^114rcvcR].
- **Coronary microvascular dysfunction**: Impaired microcirculation contributes to ischemia without epicardial obstruction [^114rcvcR].
- **Autonomic imbalance**: Enhanced sympathetic activity with parasympathetic withdrawal is implicated [^notfound].

---

## Clinical presentation

TTC typically presents with **symptoms mimicking ACS**, including:

- **Chest pain or dyspnea**: Common presenting symptoms [^115xuWSi].
- **ECG changes**: ST-segment elevation or depression, T-wave inversion, and QT prolongation are typical [^113qy54s].
- **Cardiac biomarkers**: Modest troponin elevation with disproportionately high BNP/NT-proBNP levels [^115nAVa6].
- **Wall motion abnormalities**: Transient regional dysfunction extending beyond a single coronary territory, often apical or mid-ventricular ballooning [^113QEQSK].

---

## Diagnostic criteria

The **Mayo Clinic criteria (revised 2008)** are widely used:

| **Criterion** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Transient LV wall motion abnormality | Mid-ventricular or apical ballooning with or without basal involvement |
| Absence of obstructive CAD | No significant coronary artery disease or acute plaque rupture |
| New ECG abnormalities | ST-segment elevation/depression, T-wave inversion, or modest troponin rise |
| Absence of myocarditis or pheochromocytoma | Excluded by clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings |

---

Imaging modalities include echocardiography for initial assessment, **coronary angiography** to exclude ACS, and **cardiac MRI** to confirm edema without fibrosis and differentiate from myocarditis or MI [^115NXZE8] [^117HKrBa].

---

## Management

Management is **primarily supportive**:

- **Acute phase**: Treat as ACS until excluded; provide oxygen, analgesia, and monitor for complications [^1159eYNb].
- **Medications**: Beta-blockers to blunt catecholamine effects, ACE inhibitors or ARBs for LV dysfunction, and anticoagulation if LV thrombus or severe dysfunction is present [^1159eYNb].
- **Complications**: Manage cardiogenic shock, arrhythmias, and thromboembolism as indicated [^1159eYNb].
- **Long-term**: Gradual withdrawal of medications after LV recovery; address stressors and provide psychological support [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis and recurrence

- **Recovery**: Most patients recover LV function within weeks to months, but delayed recovery is associated with worse outcomes [^112mwNbS].
- **Complications**: Cardiogenic shock, malignant arrhythmias, and thromboembolism can occur [^1112SyD8].
- **Recurrence**: Approximately 4–5% experience recurrence, often with different triggers or wall motion patterns [^1119cf2T].
- **Mortality**: Long-term mortality is comparable to ACS, particularly with physical triggers or atypical forms [^115xuWSi] [^113TooB2].

---

## Risk factors and triggers

- **Demographics**: Predominantly postmenopausal women; estrogen deficiency may increase susceptibility [^115xuWSi].
- **Triggers**: Emotional stress (grief, anxiety), physical stress (surgery, trauma, sepsis), and neurologic events (stroke, subarachnoid hemorrhage) are common [^117Q3TWo].
- **Comorbidities**: Anxiety, depression, neurologic disorders, and malignancy are associated with higher risk [^115xuWSi] [^112U71pU].

---

## Recent advances and ongoing research

Recent work highlights persistent **neurohormonal activation** and structural changes despite EF recovery, suggesting a chronic heart failure phenotype in some patients [^113t1FcS] [^115NgZBS]. Investigational therapies targeting inflammation, microvascular dysfunction, and catecholamine pathways are under study, and improved risk stratification tools, including CMR-based scores, are being developed [^111mSxTn].

---

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is a **reversible stress-induced cardiomyopathy** with significant acute and chronic morbidity. Accurate diagnosis, supportive care, and targeted follow-up are essential to optimize outcomes.

Abstract

Takotsubo syndrome (TTS) is a poorly recognized heart disease that was initially regarded as a benign condition. Recently, it has been shown that TTS may be associated with severe clinical complications including death and that its prevalence is probably underestimated. Since current guidelines on TTS are lacking, it appears timely and important to provide an expert consensus statement on TTS. The clinical expert consensus document part I summarizes the current state of knowledge on clinical presentation and characteristics of TTS and agrees on controversies surrounding TTS such as nomenclature, different TTS types, role of coronary artery disease, and etiology. This consensus also proposes new diagnostic criteria based on current knowledge to improve diagnostic accuracy.

### Acute stress-induced (takotsubo) cardiomyopathy [^115YncV2]. Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Acute stress-induced (takotsubo) cardiomyopathy has a dramatic clinical presentation, mimicking an acute myocardial infarction and is triggered by intense emotional or physical stress. In this paper, we review the current state of knowledge of the mechanistic physiology underlying the left ventricular ballooning. The pathophysiology of the recovery from this acute heart failure syndrome is presented. The short-term and long-term outlook puts this new syndrome on a different perspective compared with recently held views. Current knowledge on susceptibility and predisposition already define distinctive characteristics of patients with takotsubo compared with myocardial infarction. Gaps in knowledge and future directions of research are identified in order to best direct efforts for identifying specific therapies for this condition, in the acute setting, to mitigate postacute symptoms or to prevent recurrences, none of which exist.

Conclusions

Takotsubo syndrome is increasing in incidence and becoming more widely recognized in the medical community. The diagnosis can be challenging, and clinicians must look for signs distinguishing takotsubo syndrome from other causes of acute myocardial injury. The use of multi-modality imaging may help in this regard and improve our understanding of its underlying etiology and pathophysiology. Currently takotsubo syndrome remains a poorly understood condition with substantial morbidity and mortality without proven or effective treatments that urgently needs to be addressed.

### Acute stress induces long-term metabolic, functional, and structural remodeling of the heart [^111a4Px7]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is a stress-induced cardiovascular disease with symptoms comparable to those of an acute coronary syndrome but without coronary obstruction. Takotsubo was initially considered spontaneously reversible, but epidemiological studies revealed significant long-term morbidity and mortality, the reason for which is unknown. Here, we show in a female rodent model that a single pharmacological challenge creates a stress-induced cardiomyopathy similar to Takotsubo. The acute response involves changes in blood and tissue biomarkers and in cardiac in vivo imaging acquired with ultrasound, magnetic resonance and positron emission tomography. Longitudinal follow up using in vivo imaging, histochemistry, protein and proteomics analyses evidences a continued metabolic reprogramming of the heart towards metabolic malfunction, eventually leading to irreversible damage in cardiac function and structure. The results combat the supposed reversibility of Takotsubo, point to dysregulation of glucose metabolic pathways as a main cause of long-term cardiac disease and support early therapeutic management of Takotsubo.

Diagnostic Criteria

The diagnosis of takotsubo syndrome can be challenging because clinical features have many similarities with acute coronary syndrome and immediate early cardiac imaging is needed because of the rapid normalization of left ventricular ejection fraction. The most widely used diagnostic criteria are those proposed by the Mayo Clinic in 2004and subsequently revised in 2008(Figure 3). Other groups have proposed slightly different diagnostic conventions, such as the Gothenburg criteria, Johns Hopkins criteria, the Takotsubo Italian Network proposaland the Heart Failure Association Takotsubo Syndrome Taskforce of the European Society of Cardiology criteria. The underlying principle is that takotsubo syndrome is a diagnosis of exclusion since there has yet to be defined a specific diagnostic test or biomarker to identify the condition. Indeed, this extends to the post-mortem examination of fatal cases where specific diagnostic pathological features have yet to be defined, making it currently impossible to assign this diagnosis at autopsy.

Traditionally, the presence of coronary artery disease may have deterred the clinician from a diagnosis of takotsubo syndrome. Despite this uncertainty, it has become evident that takotsubo syndrome can co-exist in the presence of fixed coronary artery disease and can even be triggered by acute coronary syndrome. It is vital to look for subtle differences in clinical presentation to avoid misdiagnosis (Table 1). Equally, patients may be incorrectly diagnosed with takotsubo syndrome if coronary angiography reveals non-obstructive coronary artery disease, and the possibility of plaque rupture has not been ruled out, especially as stressful events are also associated with acute plaque rupture and type 1 myocardial infarction. The Inter-TAK diagnostic scorewas developed to aid the clinician in distinguishing takotsubo syndrome from acute coronary syndrome, but its performance is variable. Because understanding of the fundamental pathophysiology of takotsubo syndrome is limited, these criteria are likely to continue to evolve with time. We provide a diagnostic pathway incorporating the Inter-TAK score to aid diagnosis (Figure 3). Ultimately, the hallmark of takotsubo syndrome is the reversibility in systolic function which occurs within hours, days or weeks, in the absence of infarct-specific myocardial fibrosis. The clinical implication of recovery time remains unknown and there is emerging evidence that full recovery may be slower and less complete than initially thought.

### Takotsubo syndrome (stress cardiomyopathy): an intriguing clinical condition in search of its identity [^1169tyHe]. The American Journal of Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Takotsubo syndrome is a relatively frequent clinical entity presenting typically as an acute coronary syndrome in the absence of obstructive coronary artery disease and characterized angiographically by transient left ventricular systolic dysfunction, sparing the basal segments of the left ventricle ("apical ballooning"). Takotsubo syndrome characteristically affects peri- or postmenopausal women, albeit recent series show that men also are at risk. Takotsubo syndrome is characteristically triggered by severe emotional or physical stress, which suggests a pathogenic role for increased sympathetic activity leading to myocardial perfusion abnormalities and ventricular dysfunction. The reasons why severe emotional and physical stress result in the development of takotsubo syndrome in certain individuals but not others is still a matter of speculation, but strongly suggests the existence of predisposing factors/mechanisms in certain subjects. The present article reviews the different factors that can play a role in the development of takotsubo syndrome in different patients. We propose that triggers (ie, emotional stressors, physical stressors, iatrogenic stressors, and neurologic triggers), pathogenic mechanisms (ie, increased catecholamine levels, coronary vasomotor abnormalities leading to myocardial ischemia), and predisposing factors (ie, cardiovascular risk factors, endothelial dysfunction, comorbidities) all interact in a complex fashion and possibly differently in different patients to cause takotsubo syndrome. Identifying these factors may help in preventing and managing the condition more effectively.

### Characterization of the myocardial inflammatory response in acute stress-induced (Takotsubo) cardiomyopathy [^114X5hN6]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2018). Low credibility.

Acute stress-induced (takotsubo) cardiomyopathy has a dramatic clinical presentation, mimicking a myocardial infarction (MI)and is often precipitated by major emotional/physical stress. Despite unobstructed coronary arteries, the left ventriculogram shows characteristic myocardial ballooning, not corresponding to a single coronary artery territory, and the heart function is severely reduced. Regardless of a spontaneous process of recovery as a recognized feature of takotsubo cardiomyopathy, the mortality risk and long-term mortality are also comparable with MI. There is no current treatment, and the etiology is unclear, therefore its pathophysiology needs to be resolved before targeted therapies can be trialed. We have previously demonstrated severe global edema in both left and right ventricular myocardium of takotsubo patients during the acute phase with incomplete resolution at 4 months. The substrate of this persistent edema is most likely an ongoing inflammatory response, which remains to be characterized in detail. However, this is challenging in patients, where coexistent cardiac pathologies, lack of access to tissue, very small biopsies that do not reflect global changes, and tissue availability only at a single time point, are the norm.

### Clinical features and outcomes of Takotsubo (stress) cardiomyopathy [^115xuWSi]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2015). Excellent credibility.

Background

The natural history, management, and outcome of takotsubo (stress) cardiomyopathy are incompletely understood.

Methods

The International Takotsubo Registry, a consortium of 26 centers in Europe and the United States, was established to investigate clinical features, prognostic predictors, and outcome of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Patients were compared with age- and sex-matched patients who had an acute coronary syndrome.

Results

Of 1750 patients with takotsubo cardiomyopathy, 89.8% were women (mean age, 66.8 years). Emotional triggers were not as common as physical triggers (27.7% vs. 36.0%), and 28.5% of patients had no evident trigger. Among patients with takotsubo cardiomyopathy, as compared with an acute coronary syndrome, rates of neurologic or psychiatric disorders were higher (55.8% vs. 25.7%) and the mean left ventricular ejection fraction was markedly lower (40.7 ± 11.2% vs. 51.5 ± 12.3%) (P < 0.001 for both comparisons). Rates of severe in-hospital complications including shock and death were similar in the two groups (P = 0.93). Physical triggers, acute neurologic or psychiatric diseases, high troponin levels, and a low ejection fraction on admission were independent predictors for in-hospital complications. During long-term follow-up, the rate of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events was 9.9% per patient-year, and the rate of death was 5.6% per patient-year.

Conclusions

Patients with takotsubo cardiomyopathy had a higher prevalence of neurologic or psychiatric disorders than did those with an acute coronary syndrome. This condition represents an acute heart failure syndrome with substantial morbidity and mortality. (Funded by the Mach-Gaensslen Foundation and others; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01947621.).

### Characterization of the myocardial inflammatory response in acute stress-induced (Takotsubo) cardiomyopathy [^113bh8L9]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2018). Low credibility.

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is an acute stress-induced heart failure syndrome for which the exact pathogenic mechanisms are unclear, and consequently, no specific treatment exists. In an experimental model of stress-induced takotsubo-like cardiomyopathy, the authors describe the temporal course of a chronic inflammatory response post-induction, with an initial early influx of neutrophils into myocardial tissue followed by macrophages that are typical of a proinflammatory M1 phenotype, and a nonsignificant increase in systemic inflammatory cytokines. Post-mortem myocardium from the more complex clinical takotsubo patients share features of the study's experimental model. These findings suggest modulators of inflammation could be a potential therapeutic option.

Investigations

The investigation of takotsubo syndrome may occur either because it is the primary suspected diagnosis or, more commonly, following initial investigation for acute coronary syndrome due to the marked overlap in clinical presentation. A multimodal imaging approach is often needed to discriminate between the differential diagnoses of the acute cardiac presentation (Table 1), with cardiac magnetic resonance playing an increasingly important role.

### Takotsubo cardiomyopathy and coronary artery disease: a meaningful coincidence? [^113bE1Ao]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Since its initial description 1, Takotsubo cardiomyopathy has generated much debate and interest. Over the past 25 years, much progress has been made in understanding this syndrome. While the clinical presentation and characteristics have been well described and agreed upon, the etiology is a bit more of a debate. At present, the most commonly accepted theory on the pathophysiology of Takotsubo syndrome (TTS) centers on excess catecholaminergic state and enhanced sympathetic activity. 2, 3, 4 However, there is still some thought that TTS may represent an aborted myocardial infarction or the results of plaque rupture and transient ischemia and myocardial stunning. The Mayo criteria for TTS rely on the "absence of significant obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) or angiographic evidence of plaque rupture". 5 Since then, there have been multiple case series, challenging the notion that coronary artery disease necessarily excludes the diagnosis of TTS. It is now increasingly accepted that the 2 conditions are not mutually exclusive, but can exist coincidently.

In their current single‐center study, Eitel et al 6 try to shed some light on the causal association, or lack of it, between ACS with vulnerable plaque and TTS. For the first time, they describe the optical coherence tomography (OCT) findings in a patient population with TTS. Of note, the present study reiterates a significant prevalence of atherosclerotic plaques in these patients with TTS. Previously the prevalence of CAD in patients with TTS was noted to range between 10% and 61% in prior studies. 7, 8 In a prior retrospective cohort of patients with TTS, coronary atherosclerosis was present in the majority (61%) of patients. 7 In addition, 29% had luminal stenosis severity greater than 50% in at least 1 epicardial vessel. 7 The clinical characteristics of TTS were recently reviewed in the International Takotsubo Registry, a consortium of 26 centers in Europe and the United States including 1750 patients with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. 8 In the International Takotsubo Registry there was significant coexistence of coronary disease occurring in approximately 15% of patients. 8

### Takotsubo syndrome: pathophysiological insights and innovations in patient care [^113keiNn]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Takotsubo syndrome, also known as broken heart syndrome, was first described in Japan in the 1990s and presents as acute heart failure caused by transient contractile dysfunction that mimics acute coronary syndrome but is not caused by acute coronary obstruction. Takotsubo syndrome accounts for as much as 2–3% of suspected coronary syndromes and is considerably more common in women than in men. In this Review, we discuss the historical background and clinical features of Takotsubo syndrome and our evolving understanding of its pathophysiology. The hallmark feature of Takotsubo syndrome is transient left ventricular dysfunction linked to emotional or physical stressors. Despite advances in our understanding of the clinical presentation and possible pathophysiological mechanisms of Takotsubo syndrome, this condition continues to challenge our fundamental understanding of human anatomy and physiology, particularly regarding how acute emotional and physical stressors can trigger such profound cardiovascular dysfunction. Although the definitive mechanisms remain elusive, current hypotheses largely centre on catecholamine surges and sympathetic nervous system hyperactivation. Diagnostic criteria have been developed by the Mayo Clinic and European Society of Cardiology working groups but, in the absence of randomized controlled clinical trials, no specific treatments for Takotsubo syndrome are available. In this Review, we highlight the complex pathophysiology of Takotsubo syndrome, with an emphasis on the interplay between emotional stress and cardiac health, and call for the development of evidence-based management protocols.

A Gap in Knowledge

Overall, the data in this study fill an important gap of currently missing but much needed information for the appropriate clinical care of patients with takotsubo. Many descriptive studies have focused on the acute presentation of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. The invariable recovery of left ventricular ejection fraction has misled the medical community into believing that takotsubo cardiomyopathy is transient and self-limiting. Despite a well-recognized early mortality – and establishment of clinical features pointing to those at risk, no data have described the physiological and clinical status of these patients long term. To the best of our knowledge, these data, which demonstrate that patients with takotsubo have symptoms and objective findings compatible with a heart failure syndrome, are unique and novel in the takotsubo literature. These findings should impact clinical practice primarily in the counseling and follow-up of such patients, and they should encourage further research into therapies to mitigate symptoms and improve prognosis.

### Characterization of the myocardial inflammatory response in acute stress-induced (Takotsubo) cardiomyopathy [^115BmhPS]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

We demonstrate for the first time that a classic inflammatory response with predominant M1 macrophage infiltration of the myocardium, without a conventional switch to M2 macrophages is a characteristic of experimental takotsubo-like cardiomyopathy. This results in low-grade chronic inflammation in myocardial tissue that has potential to drive the long-term and persistent symptoms observed in takotsubo patients. Similar inflammatory changes were observed in otherwise macroscopically normal myocardium of post-mortem takotsubo human hearts, pointing to a potential new marker of this condition and suggesting inflammatory modulators, for example, switching the balance from M1 to M2 macrophages may be a therapeutic option.

Perspectives

COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE: Low-grade myocardial inflammation is a distinguishing feature following both experimental and clinical stress-induced takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Our results establish that a proinflammatory (M1 macrophages) phenotype prevails following a decline in cardiac function, which may contribute toward the morbidity and increased mortality associated with this condition in a subset of patients.

TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: No current therapy exists for takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Our study suggests that targeting the myocardial inflammatory process at the onset of disease may have merit as a clinical intervention to alleviate the long-term persistent symptoms that occur in a number of patients.

Clinical Perspective

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy has a dramatic clinical presentation, mimicking an acute myocardial infarction (MI). It is characterized by a precipitating major stressful event and diagnosed when invasive cardiac catheterization demonstrates unobstructed coronary arteries and ballooning of the left ventricle. This can lead to major left ventricular dysfunction and acute heart failure. In the weeks after onset, the left ventricular dysfunction gradually recovers, which leads to the commonly accepted belief that takotsubo cardiomyopathy is a transient and self-limiting condition. This concept has been reinforced by the absence of demonstrable myocardial damage on routine cardiac magnetic resonance imaging.

We have previously shown severe global edema of both the left and right ventricles associated with profound cardiac energetic impairment in the acute stages of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. These abnormalities do not completely resolve by 4 months and occur in apparent contradistinction to the recovery of left ventricular ejection fraction. In the current study, we explored whether long-term (> 1 year) abnormalities persist after an acute episode of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Specifically, we hypothesized that a persistent impairment in cardiac energetic status (primary end point) takes place, which, despite a normalized resting left ventricular ejection fraction, results in persistent symptoms and cardiac limitation during cardiopulmonary exercise testing (peak V 2 as secondary end point).

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TC) is characterized by transient, often severe, left ventricular dysfunction and electrocardiographic changes that might mimic acute myocardial infarction in the absence of significant obstructive coronary artery disease. It is often encountered in elderly women after physical or emotional stress. Excessive catecholamine stimulation, metabolic abnormalities, and microcirculatory dysfunction are thought to be responsible for the manifestations of this disorder. This comprehensive review summarizes relevant published data, atypical presentations, pathophysiology, and management strategy. It also includes a review of 789 patients with TC including nine illustrative cases encountered at our institution.

Clinical Perspective

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TC), also known as apical ballooning syndrome, broken heart syndrome, and stress cardiomyopathy, is a temporary and reversible form of cardiomyopathy. It often mimics acute coronary syndrome, leading to frequent misdiagnoses. Patients typically present with acute onset of chest pain, left ventricular dysfunction, electrocardiographic changes, and elevated cardiac biomarkers. However, unlike acute coronary syndrome, TC is characterized by the absence of significant obstructive coronary artery disease or acute plaque rupture on angiography.

Different diagnostic criteria exist, but the Mayo Clinic Takotsubo diagnostic criteria (now revised) are widely accepted. It requires transient left ventricular dysfunction with regional wall motion abnormalities extending beyond a single vascular territory, in the absence of obstructive coronary artery disease or acute plaque rupture. Diagnosis is supported by new electrocardiographic changes (eg, ST‐segment elevation, T‐wave inversion) and modest troponin elevation while excluding conditions like pheochromocytoma and myocarditis.

TC predominantly affects women and older adults. It is often triggered by significant emotional or physical stress. Although it is generally transient and reversible, complications such as cardiogenic shock, myocardial rupture, life‐threatening arrhythmias, and death can occur, with an inpatient mortality rate ranging between 2% and 9%. TC is linked to different short‐ and long‐term mortality outcomes, with a risk comparable to that of acute coronary syndrome. When comparing long‐term mortality rates between patients with TC and patients with ST‐segment–elevation myocardial infarction, a study has shown TC to have a significantly higher long‐term mortality rate compared with ST‐segment–elevation myocardial infarction. However, no significant differences were observed at ≥ 28 days or after 1‐year follow‐up. There have been limited studies examining inpatient, short‐term, and long‐term outcomes in TC. Researchers have sought to identify key prognostic factors to predict outcomes in TC. One notable study, using the interTAK (International Takotsubo) registry, developed a prognostic scoring system for both short‐ and long‐term mortality outcomes in TC. This system included factors such as age > 70 years, male sex, heart rate > 94 at admission, left ventricular ejection fraction < 45%, diabetes, systolic blood pressure < 119 mm Hg, and various triggers of TC. Other risk factors explored included nonhyperemic angiography‐derived indices of microcirculatory resistance, left ventricular dysfunction, low systolic blood pressure at admission, and the use of β blockers before admission, all identified as independent predictors.

### Contemporary characteristics, outcomes and novel risk score for Takotsubo cardiomyopathy: a national inpatient sample analysis [^1152e82B]. Open Heart (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TC), also known as stress-induced cardiomyopathy or broken heart syndrome, is an intriguing cardiac syndrome characterised by left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction, often transient and triggered by significant emotional or physical stress. The clinical, electrocardiogram (ECG), and biomarker presentation is dramatic, mimicking myocardial infarction. Therefore, coronary catheterisation is routinely performed to exclude obstructive coronary heart disease and plaque rupture before TC can be diagnosed. Several pathophysiological mechanisms have been implicated in TC, including overstimulation of the sympathetic system, microvascular and myocardial tissue metabolism abnormalities, coronary artery vasospasmand catecholamine surge related to emotional distress and may render the distal LV chamber selectively vulnerable to myocardial stunning. Furthermore, given the recovery these patients have within weeks of presentation, supportive care with medical management is key. Key prognostic factors to guide optimal management strategy in TC are not well-established. This study aims to assess the clinical characteristics, outcomes and prognostic predictors and develop a novel prognostic risk score in patients with TC.

### Renin-angiotensin and endothelin systems in patients post-Takotsubo cardiomyopathy [^114gAcWS]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy has become a well‐recognized acute cardiac disease, mimicking an acute myocardial infarction in its presentation, with chest pain/breathlessness, electrocardiographic changes, and biomarker release. The hallmark of the condition is "ballooning" myocardial dysfunction in the absence of culprit lesions on coronary angiography and usually in response to emotional or physical stressful triggers. Several large registries have reported increased morbidity and mortality of patients with takotsubo cardiomyopathy, comparable with that of myocardial infarction but no evidence‐based therapies exist to improve its prognosis, mainly because of a lack of understanding of its pathophysiology. We have recently demonstrated that despite a rapid and spontaneous recovery of the left ventricular ejection fraction, at least a proportion of patients with a previous diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy evolve towards a heart failure with preserved ejection fraction phenotype, when examined at a median of 2 years post‐acute event. Neurohumoral activation has been well described in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, and its antagonism is the basis for modern, first line therapy. In contrast, there is marked heterogeneity in neurohumoral activation in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, where neuro‐hormonal blockade trials that collectively included patients of multiple aetiologies were unsuccessful. Here, we investigate if the sequential acute to long‐term response of the renin‐angiotensin and endothelin‐1 systems follows the "normalization" of the left ventricular ejection fraction in patients with takotsubo cardiomyopathy.

### Characterization of the myocardial inflammatory response in acute stress-induced (Takotsubo) cardiomyopathy [^11765toA]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2018). Low credibility.

Here, we used a previously established and well-reported rodent experimental model of catecholamine (stress)-induced takotsubo-like cardiac dysfunction, where the disease process is consistent and reproducible, and there are no confounding complications or major limitations to tissue availability. Although it remains unclear whether a "catecholamine surge" is fundamentally causal in triggering human takotsubo cardiomyopathy, this experimental model results in a similar wall motion abnormality that is observed in the human disease in the absence of an ischemic or infectious insult. Our aim was to establish the type and time course of the myocardial inflammatory changes in this stress-induced experimental model and to then determine whether similar changes existed in viable, nonfibrotic myocardium from necessarily more complex human post-mortem cases. We specifically focused on detecting and characterizing macrophages, a heterogeneous cell population that infiltrates damaged tissue and functionally range between proinflammatory (M1 macrophages) and anti-inflammatory/tissue reparative/profibrotic (M2 macrophages) subtypes. Our results reveal, for the first time to our knowledge, a clear, localized, and temporal inflammatory response with a predominance of M1 proinflammatory macrophages within rat myocardial tissue following induction of takotsubo-like cardiomyopathy and evidence for a similar process in more complex human post-mortem cases. Unlike post-MI, there is no switch to M2-resolving macrophages, and the percentage of M2 macrophages correlates with recovery of cardiac function. This low-level, nonresolving inflammation provides a rationale for an immunomechanistically targeted therapeutic strategy in a condition for which no current therapy is available.

The novel COVID-19 has had an unprecedented and devastating spread internationally. COVID-19 infection can lead to a number of cardiovascular sequelae, including heart failure, which may portend worse clinical outcomes. Here, we report a rare case of a 57-year-old woman who developed acute left ventricular systolic dysfunction with apical ballooning consistent with takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM), and mixed cardiogenic and septic shock in the setting of COVID-19 disease. We briefly review the pathophysiology and diagnosis of TCM (also described as apical ballooning syndrome and stress-induced cardiomyopathy). Additionally, this case highlights the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to clinical decision-making and resource allocation in diagnosis and management of critical illness in the setting of the ongoing international COVID-19 pandemic.

Nomenclature

Takotsubo syndrome derived its name from the Japanese word for octopus trap, due to the shape of the LV at the end of systole and has been described under a remarkable number of different names in the literature including 'broken heart syndrome', 'stress cardiomyopathy', and 'apical ballooning syndrome'. No single term precisely describes the heterogeneous ventricular appearance with which this syndrome can occur. To date, consensus has not been reached on the nomenclature. The term 'takotsubo' is widely used in acknowledgement of the Japanese physicians who initially described this disorder. However, in contrast to other cardiomyopathies that are usually not transient in nature, TTS is characterized by a temporary wall motion abnormality of the LV and shares common features with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) [similar symptoms at presentation, ECG abnormalities, elevated cardiac biomarkers as well as a comparable in-hospital mortality with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-STEMI] specifically in terms of a microvascular ACS form. Among different etiologies of heart failure such as coronary artery disease (CAD), tachyarrhtyhmias etc. TTS includes a wide spectrum of emotional or physical triggers resulting also in left ventricular dysfunction. Therefore, it is best described as a 'syndrome' and the term 'takotsubo syndrome' seems most appropriate.

### Myocardial perfusion scintigraphy during chest pain: an atypical presentation of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy? [^116t69pN]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Although Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM) knowledge is increasing, the exact pathophysiology remains unclear. TCM represents 1%-2% of all troponin positive acute coronary syndromes, affects predominantly postmenopausal women, and is commonly preceded by exposure to severe physical or emotional stress. Transient wall motion abnormalities mimicking ST-elevation myocardial infarction is expected as well as increase of troponin levels and echocardiography alterations. This case report is about a patient that as far as we know is the first case that shows the use of myocardial perfusion imaging in the acute phase of TCM. In general, the TCM Mayo Clinic diagnostic criteria have been very helpful in the clinical setting. In this specific case, however, the presence of reduced myocardial perfusion in the acute phase combined with increased troponin levels seemed to be in contradiction with the exclusion of obstructive coronary artery disease.

### A signature of circulating microRNAs differentiates Takotsubo cardiomyopathy from acute myocardial infarction [^113jcFf9]. European Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC) is an increasingly recognized acute syndrome with symptoms similar to acute myocardial infarction (MI), including chest pain and electrocardiographic changes, mostly in the absence of obstructive coronary artery disease. – The syndrome is often triggered by emotional or physical stress factors and comprises reversible wall motion abnormalities involving apical, midventricular, basal or focal segments of the left ventricle. – Even if wall motion abnormalities usually resolve within few days to weeks and the overall prognosis is favourable, – TTC remains a life-threatening disease in the acute phase, since 10% of the patients develop malignant arrhythmia, cardiogenic shock, or ventricular wall rupturewith a mortality rate up to 8%.– In the acute phase, TTC is indistinguishable from acute MI with respect to clinical symptoms, ECG changes, and cardiac biomarkers such as troponin, creatine kinase (CK), and CK-MB. Although the peak ratio of NT-proBNP/troponin has been described to distinguish patients with TTC and acute MI, fast and accurate diagnosis on admission remains challenging, and coronary angiography is still mandatory to exclude acute MI. Thus, there is a need for sensitive and specific biomarkers for the early diagnosis of TTC.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) are a class of highly conserved, small (19–25 nucleotides) noncoding post-transcriptional regulators of diverse cellular processes including proliferation, angiogenesis, differentiation, and apoptosis. MicroRNAs have recently been considered as biomarkers in cardiovascular disease, i.e. in heart failure, stable coronary artery disease, and acute MI. Thus, we hypothesized that miRNAs may serve as sensitive and specific biomarkers in TTC allowing for immediate diagnosis. Therefore, we searched for circulating miRNAs regulated in the acute course of TTC.

### Artificial intelligence in differentiating Takotsubo syndrome from myocardial infarction… [^113Gq1hZ]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

The ROC curve based on the 2 different chamber views using all sequences is presented. The SD is calculated based on 5 different training and classification runs of the temporal neural network. LAD-AMI indicates left anterior descending acute myocardial infarction; TTS, takotsubo syndrome; 2-ch, 2 chamber; 4-ch, 4 chamber. Takotsubo syndrome is characterized by acute ventricular dysfunction, which can result in severe adverse effects, including death. 9–11 Patients with TTS typically present signs and symptoms similar to acute myocardial infarction, 10, 12, 13 rendering differential diagnosis challenging. Early recognition of TTS has important implications in clinical practice for appropriate clinical and therapeutic management. Nonetheless, to date, reliable and widely accepted criteria for a differential diagnosis of TTS based on echocardiographic features are lacking.
14.

We performed a sensitivity analysis of the given latent representations applying a small change to a certain latent feature value and visualizing the difference between the modified and the unchanged reconstructed segmented frame. We showed that different components of the latent feature representation focus on different parts of the myocardium. The affected areas are consistent over different videos. Medical experts verified that these learned representations encode information about the cardiac cycle. By tracking movements of different parts of the myocardium and learning their temporal dynamics, the model is able to differentiate between TTS and AMI. Based on these videos, the cardiologists first performed a binary differential diagnosis of TTS vs AMI and second stated their level of diagnostic confidence on a 1 to 5-point scale.

To generate the receiver operating characteristic curves for the human graders, we translated the two 5-point confidence scales into a continuous 10-point scale reaching from 0 to 9. In terms of discriminating TTS from AMI, previous echocardiography studies revealed that despite a lower increase in troponin values, patients with TTS show more diffuse regional wall motion abnormalities than patients with anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction. 20 In addition, a characteristic pattern of regional systolic myocardial dysfunction that extends beyond the distribution territory of a single coronary artery with symmetrical involvement of anterior, inferior, septal, and lateral walls, has been described for patients with TTS.

### Standard and advanced echocardiography in Takotsubo (stress) cardiomyopathy: clinical and prognostic implications [^113grCCV]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2015). Low credibility.

Echocardiography is frequently the initial noninvasive imaging modality used to assess patients with takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC). Standard transthoracic echocardiography can provide, even in the acute care setting, useful information about left ventricular (LV) morphology as well as regional and global systolic or diastolic function. It allows the differentiation of different LV morphologic patterns according to the localization of wall motion abnormalities. A "circumferential pattern" of LV myocardial dysfunction characterized by symmetric wall motion abnormalities involving the midventricular segments of the anterior, inferior, and lateral walls should be considered suggestive of TTC and included in the differential diagnosis of acute coronary syndromes. Moreover, advanced echocardiographic techniques, including speckle-tracking, myocardial contrast, and coronary flow studies, are providing mechanistic and pathophysiologic insights into this unique syndrome. Early identification of any potential complications (i.e. LV outflow tract obstruction, reversible moderate to severe mitral regurgitation, right ventricular involvement, thrombus formation, and cardiac rupture) are crucial for the management, risk stratification, and follow-up of patients with TTC. Because of the dynamic evolution of the syndrome, comprehensive serial echocardiographic examinations should be systematically performed. This review focuses on these aspects of imaging and the increasing understanding of the clinical and prognostic utility of echocardiography in TTC.

Takotsubo syndrome (TTS) is a reversible form of acute myocardial injury due to a neurocardiogenic mechanism associated with a relevant risk for life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, occurring in up to 25% of all patients and including both ventricular arrhythmias (especially) in the context of QT prolongation and atrial tachy- or bradyarrhythmias. The pathogenetic mechanisms of TTS-related arrhythmic complications are not completely understood, and there are no randomized clinical trials addressing the pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic management in this specific setting. In this narrative review, the authors provide an overview of the pathogenesis and the therapeutic management of arrhythmic complications in patients with TTS, along with the future perspectives and the remaining knowledge gaps in this field.

Diagnostic criteria

The diagnosis of TTS is often challenging because its clinical phenotype may closely resemble AMI regarding ECG abnormalities and biomarkers. While a widely established non-invasive tool allowing a rapid and reliable diagnosis of TTS is currently lacking, coronary angiography with left ventriculography is considered the gold standard diagnostic tool to exclude or confirm TTS.

Abe et al. introduced the first diagnostic criteria for TTS in 2003. One year later, a dedicated group of cardiologists from the Mayo Clinic proposed their diagnostic criteria. In 2006, the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association classified TTS as a primary acquired cardiomyopathy. In 2008, the revised version of the Mayo Clinic Diagnostic Criteria was published incorporating neurogenic stunned myocardium. Furthermore, the authors defined different TTS sub-types and highlighted that obstructive coronary lesions may occasionally be present concomitantly. The Mayo Clinic Diagnostic Criteria are the most widely known, but exceptions to the rule [e.g. the presence of CAD] are poorly appreciated among physicians and cardiologists. More recently, other research groups have proposed slightly different criteria for TTS, i.e. the Japanese Guidelines, the Gothenburg criteria, the Johns Hopkins criteria, the Tako-tsubo Italian Network proposal, the criteria of the Heart Failure Association (HFA) TTS Taskforce of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC), as well as the criteria recommended by Madias. Thus, there is a lack of a worldwide consensus. Based on current knowledge, we have developed new international diagnostic criteria (InterTAK Diagnostic Criteria, Table 1) for the diagnosis of TTS that may help to improve identification and stratification of TTS. The most important changes with accompanying rationale include:

Refining the Criteria for Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy

Since the first set of criteria (Mayo criteria) was proposed by Bybee et al 5 over 10 years ago, we have come to understand TTS better. Indeed, a new set of 7 diagnostic criteria was proposed earlier this year by the task force on TTS of the Heart Failure Association of the European Society of Cardiology. 19 The 7 diagnostic criteria include the following:
Transient regional wall motion abnormalities of LV or RV myocardium that are frequently, but not always, preceded by a stressful trigger (emotional or physical).
The regional wall motion abnormalities usually extend beyond a single epicardial vascular distribution, and often result in circumferential dysfunction of the ventricular segments involved.
The absence of culprit atherosclerotic coronary artery disease including acute plaque rupture, thrombus formation, and coronary dissection or other pathological conditions to explain the pattern of temporary LV dysfunction observed (eg, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, viral myocarditis).
New and reversible electrocardiography abnormalities (ST‐segment elevation, ST depression, left bundle branch block, T‐wave inversion, and/or QTc prolongation) during the acute phase (3 months).
Significantly elevated serum brain natriuretic peptide or N‐terminal pro‐ brain natriuretic peptide during the acute phase.
Positive but relatively small elevation in cardiac troponin measured with a conventional assay (ie, disparity between the troponin level and the amount of dysfunctional myocardium present).
Recovery of ventricular systolic function on cardiac imaging at follow‐up (3–6 months).

Simply put, the current criteria state that if CAD is present, it does not contribute to the pathophysiologic state and transient LV dysfunction associated with TTS. Incorporating the additional knowledge currently provided by OCT imaging and CMR may help further distinguish TTS from other differentials. OCT can be further used to characterize CAD, if present, and eliminate the possibility of an acute plaque rupture and the culprit lesion. Furthermore, expanding on criterion number 7, recovery of ventricular systolic function on cardiac imaging may also conceivably necessitate the absence of scar or late gadolinium enhancement by CMR. So, as we learn more about TTS, our diagnostic criteria will need to continue to evolve.

### Conventional cardiovascular risk factors associated with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy: a comprehensive review [^111UYjoW]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM) is a reversible left ventricular dysfunction that is commonly known as "broken heart" syndrome. The first case of TCM was in Japan in 1990, and has since become increasingly reported worldwide.TCM is a syndrome characterized by transient left ventricular systolic dysfunction that is similar to acute coronary syndrome (ACS), but without angiographic evidence of obstructive coronary artery disease or acute plaque rupture.TCM was initially considered as a benign disease. However, recent research has found that the long‐term mortality rate of TCM patients exceeds that of ST‐segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients. The pathogenesis of TCM is still unclear, which may involve a multi‐factor pathophysiological mechanism. At present, the most accepted hypothesis is the catecholamine surge, which lead to myocardial injury. Other proposed pathogenesis includes sympathetic overactivation (SO), coronary artery vasospasm, microvascular dysfunction, estrogen deficiency, and endothelial dysfunction. There are different criteria for the diagnosis of TCM, and the Mayo Clinic diagnostic standard modified in 2008 is the most widely known. The new assessment method of the International Takotsubo (Inter TAK) diagnostic score has also been proposed recently.

Studies demonstrated that TCM has distinct features in gender and age distribution, and its patient population is prominently postmenopausal women. In addition, conventional cardiovascular factors are relatively common in TCM patients, such as hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia (HLD), obesity, diabetes mellitus (DM), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, evidence on the relationship of traditional cardiovascular factors and TCM are still limited. In this review article, we sought to summarize the current literature on the clinical relationship between TCM and conventional cardiovascular risk factors.

### Use of β-blockers and in-hospital mortality in patients with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy: systematic review and meta-analysis [^1158vAsF]. Open Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

First described in 1990, Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TC) is a stress-induced catecholamine acute myocardial dysfunction in the absence of significant coronary disease and is characterised by transient left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, usually triggered by physical or emotional stress. It is worth noting that happy emotions are also associated with TC. Because of this transience, the pathophysiology of TC has been defined as benign conduction. However, there is a risk of recurrenceand serious cardiac complications, such as cardiogenic shock, with a 5.6% mortality per patient a year.

The acute in-hospital mortality of TC usually is low (< 3%), but is more prevalent in elderly patients aged over 75 years, which can reach up to 6.3%, mainly because they have a greater number of non-cardiovascular comorbidities. Despite this, younger patients tend to have more in-hospital complications related to TC, such as cardiogenic shock or intracranial bleeding, but mortality is less. The young group also has distinct characteristics, with a male predominance and physical stress as the TC cause.

The most widely accepted pathophysiological hypothesis for TC suggests that there is an excessive peak of catecholamines and sympathetic hyperstimulation. The excess of catecholamines could be responsible for apical ballooning and consequent cardiotoxicity, with a drop in the LV ejection fraction, due to microvascular dysfunction. Therefore, the use of beta-blockers (β-blockers) in the treatment of TC has been proposed as a therapeutic strategy, reducing intraventricular pressure gradient. To this date, there is no specific treatment for this condition and in the GEIST registry, the use of medications to treat heart failure secondary to TC did not alter the LV ejection fraction.

According to the facts above, the impact of the use of β-blockers in-hospital mortality of patients with TC remains incompletely uncertain. To fill this gap, a systematic review and meta-analysis were carried out, seeking to demonstrate the effects on in-hospital mortality of using β-Blockers in the acute phase of TC.

### ECG criteria to differentiate between Takotsubo (stress) cardiomyopathy and myocardial infarction [^112DrypZ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC), also called stress‐induced cardiomyopathy, is characterized by a transient, reversible, regional systolic and diastolic dysfunction usually involving the left ventricular apex and midventricle with hyperkinesia of the basal left ventricular segments. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 The early clinical features are similar to those of acute coronary syndromes including chest pain, ECG changes, and modest elevation in cardiac troponin. 1, 6, 7, 8 The differential diagnosis can be challenging, especially in the presence of ST‐segment elevation on the admission ECG, where a rapid treatment decision including reperfusion therapy is crucial.

Electrocardiographic characteristics at the time of presentation have been proposed as a means to differentiate between TTC and acute coronary syndromes, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 but data are still insufficient, partially due to limited sample size of most studies and heterogeneity of study designs. In addition, the majority of ECG studies compared TTC to only anterior myocardial infarction (MI). In fact, admission ECG patterns of TTC patients are diverse, and the prevalence of ST‐elevation is quite variable, ranging from 11% to 100%. 3, 5, 17, 18

The aim of the present study was to compare admission ECG between TTC and acute MI including ST elevation MI (STEMI) and non‐ST elevation MI (NSTEMI) in our large cohort of patients in order to define specific ECG changes that differentiate between both entities.

### Clinical predictors and prognostic impact of recovery of wall motion abnormalities in Takotsubo syndrome: results from the international Takotsubo registry [^114za26P]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Takotsubo syndrome (TTS) is an acute heart failure syndrome characterized by left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and peculiar patterns of wall motion abnormalities (WMA). 1, 2, 3, 4 Although this condition typically affects postmenopausal women and is often preceded by emotional or physical triggers, recent studies have demonstrated that TTS is more heterogeneous than previously thought. 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 Several studies have shown that TTS, which has typically been considered a benign disease, may represent a serious illness with mortality rates comparable to acute coronary syndrome in the acute phase and with a high rate of adverse events at long‐term follow‐up. 1, 10, 11

Despite the recent progress in understanding TTS, many uncertainties remain. Recovery from LV dysfunction is a pivotal defining characteristic of TTS. However, the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the LV dysfunction are still unclear and the clinical aspects of recovery have scarcely been investigated. Previous studies have shown that most patients with TTS recover from LV dysfunction within 1 to 6 months, but wide interindividual variation in the duration of the recovery process has been reported. 1, 12, 13, 14 Moreover, the clinical implications of recovery time in TTS are also uncertain. First, it is unclear whether the differences in the duration of recovery affect outcomes of TTS patients. Second, the specific clinical parameters that influence or predict the duration of the LV recovery process are unknown. Finally, patients with higher risk of late resolution of WMA cannot currently be identified during the acute phase. This last issue might be of particular importance because this patient population may require longer monitoring and supportive therapy to improve outcomes.

In this analysis, we aimed to assess the clinical features of TTS patients without early resolution of WMA and to compare their outcomes to those of patients with early resolution of WMA. Furthermore, clinical parameters associated with the absence of early recovery were investigated.

### An unusual manifestation of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy [^113dfkSc]. Clinical Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy typically presents with chest pain, ST changes, and transient left ventricular apical ballooning in the absence of epicardial coronary artery disease. This process is reversible and usually benign. An unusual manifestation is that of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction with systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve. Recognition of this finding is critical in patient management especially in the setting of cardiogenic shock, as inotropes are likely to aggravate and worsen the clinical condition. We provide a systematic review and an illustrative case and discuss treatment strategies.

### Natural history of cardiac arrest in patients with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy [^112Lb8Kr]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Cardiac arrest (CA) is relatively rare but lethal complication of takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC). In most instances, patients are diagnosed with TTC after CA, making it difficult to distinguish if TTC is the precipitant or the consequence of the index event. In this systematic review, patient-level data were obtained to seek out the characteristics of patients in whom the underlying cause of CA is TTC. A comprehensive search of 4 major databases (Embase, Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, and Google Scholar) was performed from their inception to the last week of September 2014. Of 186 citations, 62 case studies were included in the analysis, providing patient-level data on 77 patients. In 60 patients (78%), the diagnosis of TTC was made after CA. Patients presenting with CA were younger (mean age 49.5 ± 16 vs 64.9 ± 11 years, p < 0.0001) and had relatively shorter corrected QT interval (mean 530 ± 101 vs 616 ± 140 ms) on electrocardiography. TTC-related hypotension was the major cause of CA in the acute phase, while a long corrected QT interval triggered CA in the subacute (24- to 72-hour) phase. In 11 patients, CA was not directly instigated by TTC despite a left ventricular appearance matching TTC. In conclusion, in TTC, CA typically develops within the first 3 days of presentation and is the result of long corrected QT interval-induced polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. Secondary TTC, in which patients present with typical left ventricular features after CA, likely represents a distinct cohort in which identifiable inheritable arrhythmias or structural heart disease should be sought.

### When is the broken heart most dangerous? Assessing risk factors to predict inpatient death in Takotsubo cardiomyopathy: analysis of the national inpatient sample for 2021 [^115ccDY3]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Although most studies have concentrated on long‐term outcomes, short‐term outcomes, particularly inpatient results, are less explored, largely because TC is generally considered benign with expected full recovery. However, emerging research indicates that patients with certain underlying medical conditions may have a poorer prognosis. Identifying risk factors is crucial for guiding therapies and improving inpatient morbidity and mortality rates in patients with TC. This study assesses the patient characteristics and comorbidities predicting inpatient death from TC. Understanding these risk factors is essential for clinical decision making and improving prognostic assessments.

### Predictors of short-and long-term outcomes of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy [^116Rg2tG]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TC) is a reversible cardiomyopathy with a benign short-term prognosis but is associated with recurrence rate of 10%. Clinical variables that predict long-term mortality and recurrence are unknown; 56 consecutive patients presenting to a single urban medical center who fulfilled the Mayo Clinic criteria for the diagnosis of TC were included. Patients were followed with 100% completeness; > 60 clinical factors were analyzed, including presentation, treatment, electrocardiogram, and echocardiographic, angiographic, and demographic variables. Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier function and Cox proportional hazards regression models. There were 15 deaths during follow-up: 5 in-hospital, 4 before 90 days, and 6 after 90 days. Mean survival was 4.47 years (95% confidence interval 3.81 to 5.13). All short-term survivors had repeat ejection fraction evaluation demonstrating improvement; 45 of 56 patients were women and 96% were postmenopausal. The nonfatal recurrence rate was 1.8%. QTc interval at presentation was the factor most strongly predictive of overall outcome, after intubation. All patients with mortality had QTc intervals between 400 and 550 ms. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the prognostic significance of QTc prolongation at presentation in TC. Because the cause of TC involves intense catecholamine release and hyperadrenergic tone, the QTc may reflect the individual impact on myocardial repolarization and the balance between sympathetic innervation and parasympathetic compensation. In conclusion, in this series, TC was associated with an 8.9% in-hospital mortality, an additional 17.9% mortality after discharge, and a nonfatal recurrence rate of 1.8%. Moreover, the QTc on presentation with TC was predictive of outcome.

### Clinical characteristics and cardiovascular magnetic resonance findings in stress (Takotsubo) cardiomyopathy… [^115NXZE8]. JAMA Network (2011). Excellent credibility.

Left ventricular ejection fraction was reduced in all patients. Stress cardiomyopathy was accurately identified by CMR using specific criteria: a typical pattern of LV dysfunction, myocardial edema, absence of significant necrosis/fibrosis, and markers for myocardial inflammation. Follow-up CMR imaging showed complete normalization of LV ejection fraction and inflammatory markers in the absence of significant fibrosis in all patients. Stress cardiomyopathy, first reported in Japan as takotsubo, is characterized by acute, profound, but reversible left ventricular dysfunction in the absence of significant coronary artery disease, triggered by acute emotional or physical stress. 1 This phenomenon is identified by a distinctive pattern of "apical ballooning" and primarily affects postmenopausal women.

2–5 The majority of patients have a clinical presentation similar to that of acute coronary syndrome. Accordingly, international guidelines have included SC as an important differential diagnosis of ACS.
6. Another 4 patients died during the follow-up period. Among the remaining 248 patients, a complete clinical follow-up including CMR imaging and/or echocardiography for confirmation of LV function recovery was available. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging was performed in 158 patients after a median of 97 days. Follow-up echocardiography and CMR imaging showed normalization of LV ejection fraction in all patients. Similarly, end-diastolic and end-systolic volume decreased. Furthermore, mean T2 SI and EGE ratios decreased significantly. Using a threshold of 5 SD, none of the patients had LGE at follow-up.

No relation was evident between persistence of tissue characteristics on CMR imaging and clinical features, troponin level, or type of stress trigger. Our study allowed for several important observations: first, we found a considerably broader clinical profile than previously reported. Second, myocardial edema, inflammation, and absence of fibrosis have been identified as potentially important markers for diffuse, reversible myocardial injury and provide unique insights into the pathogenesis and tissue pathology of this increasingly recognized syndrome. Third, our data indicate that CMR imaging using specific criteria may be useful as a diagnostic tool for patients with SC at the time of acute clinical presentation.

### Racial disparities in clinical outcomes of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy: an analysis of the national inpatient sample 2006 to 2018 [^116CsM6p]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TC), also known as stress‐induced cardiomyopathy or broken‐heart syndrome, is characterized by acute and reversible cardiac dysfunction that can be triggered by emotional or physical stress. Despite a presentation similar to acute coronary syndrome (ACS), TC is not caused by plaque rupture or obstructive coronary artery disease, which can often lead to a diagnostic challenge. The reported incidence of TC in patients with a principal diagnosis of ACS ranges from 1.7% to 2.2%, but recent data even suggest that TC may account for up to 10% of women presenting as ACS. The pathophysiology of TC remains incompletely understood, although proposed mechanisms include multivessel coronary vasospasm, abnormalities in coronary microvascular function, and catecholamine‐mediated cardiotoxicity.

Racial disparities have been observed in several cardiovascular diseases, such as heart failure and acute myocardial infarction, possibly due to socioeconomic or health care–related factors. Despite recent research exploring the impact of race on patient outcomes, large population‐based studies on TC are still lacking. In this study, we aim to investigate differences in clinical characteristics and in‐hospital outcomes between White and Black patients with TC, using the US National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database. Our study is also one among few studies that applied models to determine the most important predictors in each race.

### Sex differences in Takotsubo syndrome: a narrative review [^113xq7gu]. Journal of Women's Health (2020). Medium credibility.

Takotsubo syndrome (TTS), or apical ballooning syndrome, is a transient and usually reversible form of cardiac dysfunction. It has classically been described in women with cardiac susceptibility when exposed to emotional or physical stress. Various hypotheses on the pathophysiology of TTS have been suggested, but the underlying mechanism remains unknown. There is increasing recognition of the sex differences in the presentation, triggers, severity, and complications of TTS. A literature review was conducted and found 75 relevant articles on PubMed Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar from 2001 to 2019 regarding TTS. We found remarkable sex differences existed in the underlying triggers, pathophysiology, illness severity, complications, and mortality. However, no sex differences were identified for baseline transthoracic echocardiogram findings, age at presentation, presenting symptoms, recurrence, and treatment approach. Much information regarding TTS remain lacking, but collaboration of national and international registries will be beneficial in addressing these gaps.

### Takotsubo cardiomyopathy in pregnancy [^114tAfZP]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is a cardiac condition associated with the acute onset of chest pain, abnormalities in cardiac enzymes and electrocardiogram, and a distinct pattern of left ventricular dysfunction on echocardiography. This case evaluates an obstetric patient diagnosed with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy during her 23rd week of pregnancy.

Case

A woman (G3P2002) at 23 weeks in an intrauterine pregnancy was admitted with chest pain. ST-segment elevation was noted on electrocardiogram with elevated cardiac enzymes. Subsequent tracings showed resolution of ST elevation with conservative management. Echocardiography was consistent with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. She delivered through spontaneous vaginal delivery at term after a complete resolution of her cardiomyopathy.

Conclusion

Although uncommon, physicians who manage cardiac complications should be familiar with the diagnosis and management of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.

### Prognostic significance of early rehospitalization after Takotsubo cardiomyopathy [^111Sgh4m]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Short-term complications, particularly rehospitalization, after a diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC) are poorly described. We sought to characterize the rates, causes, clinical associations, and prognostic implications of early rehospitalization in this patient population. We performed a retrospective observational study of all adult subjects diagnosed with TTC at an academic tertiary care hospital from 2005 to 2015. The primary outcome was rehospitalization within 30 days of index discharge. Multivariable logistic regression was used to test for association between clinical variables and rehospitalization. Association between rehospitalization and survival after index discharge was assessed as a secondary outcome using a multivariable Cox proportional hazard model. Two hundred sixty-three subjects met the inclusion criteria for the study. There were 38 rehospitalizations among 32 subjects (12%). Ninety-five percent of rehospitalizations were due to nonheart failure causes, and 76% were related to noncardiovascular complaints. In multivariable analysis, recent hospitalization before TTC diagnosis and increased length of index hospitalization were associated with greater risk of rehospitalization (odds ratio 4.58, 95% CI 1.97 to 10.65, p < 0.001 and odds ratio 1.05, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.10, p = 0.026, respectively). Early rehospitalization after TTC was associated with decreased survival (hazard ratio 3.17, 95% CI 1.53 to 6.56, p = 0.002).

### The broken heart syndrome: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy [^1126rV9p]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

First described in 1990, Takotsubo cardiomyopathy consists of a transient systolic dysfunction of localized segments of the left ventricle. Commonly occurring in postmenopausal women, Takotsubo is often associated with intense physical and/or emotional stress. It is traditionally identified by distinctive wall motion patterns on transthoracic echocardiogram and left ventriculography. Further understanding of the disease mechanisms and recognition of at-risk populations has potentially tremendous therapeutic benefit.

### A review of the interplay between Takotsubo cardiomyopathy and adrenal insufficiency: catecholamine surge and glucocorticoid deficiency [^113FPZNk]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (TCM) is a transient heart condition often precipitated by stress and characterized by atypical ventricular ballooning. The interplay between TCM and Adrenal Insufficiency (AI), particularly the influence of catecholamine excess and glucocorticoid deficiency on TCM's pathogenesis in individuals with AI, warrants comprehensive exploration for a better understanding of TCM pathophysiology and establishment of potential therapeutic strategies.

Methods

We conducted an extensive literature search via PubMed and Google Scholar, targeting reports on AI, heart failure, and cardiomyopathy, supplemented by forward and backward citation tracing. We analyzed 46 cases from 45 reports, assessing the clinical presentation and outcomes in the context of AI categorization.

Results

In patients with AI, a glucocorticoid deficit appears to exacerbate the myocardial vulnerability to catecholamine toxicity, precipitating TCM. Most conditions were reversible; however, three pre-1990 cases resulted in irreversible outcomes.

Conclusions

The investigation into the AI and TCM intersection highlights the pathogenic significance of catecholamines in the absence of glucocorticoids. The data consolidates the hypothesis that glucocorticoid scarcity exacerbates the cardiac susceptibility to catecholaminergic toxicity, potentially triggering TCM. The study affirms glucocorticoids' cardioprotective roles and elucidates how catecholamine surges contribute to TCM pathogenesis, suggesting strategic clinical management adjustments for AI patients to reduce TCM incidence.

### ECG criteria to differentiate between Takotsubo (stress) cardiomyopathy and myocardial infarction [^114a1XNi]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

This is the largest study defining specific ECG criteria to differentiate between TTC and MI. Our aim was to generate simple and specific ECG criteria that are helpful in the differential diagnosis of TTC and acute MI in the emergency setting. Due to a different management, the acute recognition of TTC is clinically important, but usually a challenging task given the similarities in the clinical presentation, ECG, and biomarker characteristics of the 2 entities. 1, 6, 7, 8 Eventually, emergency coronary angiography and ventriculography are required to confirm the underlying diagnosis of both conditions. The early differentiation between these 2 entities has a potential benefit regarding the timing of the coronary angiography and the antiplatelet/anticoagulation regimen to be used, especially in patients with multiple comorbidities such as those presenting after physical stressors such as subarachnoid hemorrhage or hemorrhagic stroke, known to be typical triggers for TTC. 1

### Takotsubo cardiomyopathy triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection in a critically ill patient [^112cypMz]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

COVID-19 became a global pandemic in early 2020. While well known for its pulmonary manifestations, the virus also has a number of cardiac manifestations as well. Takotsubo syndrome has scarcely been reported in patients with COVID-19, but it is possible that the cytokine storm associated with the infection can trigger Takotsubo syndrome in patients with underlying risk factors for Takotsubo (emotional distress, physical distress, history of psychiatric disorders).

### Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, or broken-heart syndrome [^115TmFDW]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of takotsubo cardiomyopathy, also known as apical ballooning syndrome or stress cardiomyopathy.

Case Summary

A 68-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and anxiety presented with symptoms that mimicked acute coronary syndrome (ACS); the chief symptom was chest tightness. An electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm, with minimal ST elevation in the anterior leads. The patient was initially treated for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction and symptoms resolved. Coronary angiography ruled out ACS and confirmed a diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.

Discussion

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is commonly triggered by severe emotional or psychological stress and occurs primarily in postmenopausal women. A reversible contractility abnormality of the left ventricle causes the ventricle to take on a balloon-like appearance; hence the name of takotsubo, a Japanese octopus fishing pot that has a narrow neck and a wide midsection. Signs and symptoms of takotsubo cardiomyopathy mimic those of ACS. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is best diagnosed with coronary angiography, which can rule out blockage. Treatment usually consists of carvedilol and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocking agent if left ventricular ejection fraction is less than 40%. The syndrome is usually spontaneously reversible and cardiovascular function returns to normal after a few weeks.

Conclusions

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy causes a reversible left ventricle dysfunction which occurs most commonly in postmenopausal women with or without cardiovascular disease. Recognition is detected with coronary angiography. It is thought to primarily be due to an abnormally high sympathetic stimulation after emotional or psychological stress. Treatment consists of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and/or beta blocker if needed for left ventricular dysfunction and possibly an anxiolytic agent.

### International expert consensus document on Takotsubo syndrome (part I): clinical characteristics, diagnostic criteria, and pathophysiology [^111PjPiH]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Types of takotsubo syndrome

Although several anatomical TTS variants have been described four major types can be differentiated based on the distribution of regional wall motion abnormalities as shown in Figure 4. The most common TTS type and widely recognized form is the (i) apical ballooning type also known as the typical TTS form, which occurs in the majority of cases. Over the past years, atypical TTS types have been increasingly recognized. These include the (ii) midventricular, (iii) basal, and (iv) focal wall motion patterns. Recently, it has been demonstrated that patients suffering from atypical TTS have a different clinical phenotype. These patients are younger, suffer more often from neurologic comorbidities, have lower brain natriuretic peptide values, a less impaired LVEF, and more frequent ST-segment depression compared to typical TTS. In-hospital complication rate is similar between typical and atypical types, while 1-year mortality is higher in typical TTS. After adjustment for confounders, LVEF < 45%, atrial fibrillation, neurologic disorders but not TTS phenotype were independent predictors of death. Beyond 1-year, long-term mortality is similar in typical and atypical TTS phenotypes, therefore, patients should be equally monitored and treated. The basal phenotype has been reported to be associated with the presence of pheochromocytoma, epinephrine-induced TTS, or subarachnoid haemorrhageconsequently, these conditions should be considered in this particular setting.

The blue dashed lines demonstrate the region of the wall motion abnormality. Reprinted and modified with permission from Templin et al.

Besides the four major TTS types, other morphological variants have been described including the biventricular (apical type and right ventricular involvement), isolated right ventricular, and global form. Global hypokinesia as a manifestation of TTS is difficult to prove given the very broad differential diagnoses including conditions such as tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. Right ventricular involvement is present in about one-third of TTS patients and may be a predictor for worse outcome. The true prevalence of the isolated right ventricular form is unknown since little attention is paid to the right ventricle in daily clinical echo routine.

Patients with recurrent TTS can demonstrate different wall motion patterns at each event, suggesting that left ventricular adrenergic receptor distribution does not explain different TTS types.

### Persistent long-term structural, functional, and metabolic changes after stress-induced (Takotsubo) cardiomyopathy [^115NgZBS]. Circulation (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

We describe a new clinical phenotype in patients who suffered an acute takotsubo episode > 1 year previously. This is characterized by impaired cardiac energetic status and reduced maximal oxygen consumption on exercise because of significant cardiac limitation. Our findings demonstrate that patients with prior takotsubo cardiomyopathy develop a heart failure phenotype with a significant impact on quality of life.

### SCAI expert consensus statement on sex-specific considerations in myocardial revascularization [^111bby3k]. Journal of the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography & Interventions (2022). High credibility.

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy — sex distribution, diagnostic confirmation, and prognosis highlight predominantly postmenopausal presentation with favorable recovery. While over 90% of patients with takotsubo cardiomyopathy are postmenopausal women, the pathophysiology of the disorder remains unknown. Due to the similarities in emergency presentation between patients with takotsubo cardiomyopathy and atherosclerotic plaque rupture, coronary angiography should be performed to confirm the diagnosis as well as cardiac MRI to assess myocardial global and regional function, inflammation, necrosis and perfusion and to rule out coronary embolization as an underlying cause. Treatment is supportive and includes management of acute heart failure with hemodynamic support as needed, and patients generally have a good prognosis with recovery of LV function in 95% of patients within several weeks.

### Change of heart: reverse Takotsubo's cardiomyopathy – A case report [^114Yfxx8]. Clinical Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Reverse takotsubo's cardiomyopathy is a rare and relatively unknown variant of takotsubo's cardiomyopathy, also known as stress cardiomyopathy or broken heart syndrome. There are significant differences in the patient age and clinical profiles between classic and reverse takotsubo's cardiomyopathy. Classic takotsubo's cardiomyopathy has been extensively described. However, the little described literature related to reverse takotsubo's cardiomyopathy is limited to the cardiology speciality, with a relative paucity described in radiology. We describe a case report of a 73 year-old female who was diagnosed with reverse takotsubo's cardiomyopathy on the basis of Cardiac MRI. Herein, we hope to bring more awareness of this condition and describe its features on MRI.

### Recovery of left ventricular function and long-term outcomes in patients with Takotsubo syndrome [^112mwNbS]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Takotsubo syndrome (TTS) is a form of transient left ventricular (LV) dysfunction that usually resolves within days to weeks.

Objectives

We aimed to assess the predictors and prognostic impact of time-to-LV recovery after TTS.

Methods

Prospective serial imaging data from the nationwide, multicenter RETAKO (REgistry on TAKOtsubo Syndrome) were comprehensively reviewed to assess the timing of LV recovery. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess factors associated with late (≥ 10 days) vs early (< 10 days) recovery. The long-term risk of all-cause mortality was compared between the late and early recovery groups using fully adjusted Cox models, and using flexible parametric survival models with recovery time included as a continuous variable.

Results

Of 1,463 patients included (median age 73 years, 13% men), 373 (25%) had late and 1,090 (75%) had early LV recovery. Older age, history of neurological disorders, bystander coronary artery disease, active cancer, physical triggers, elevated inflammatory biomarkers, cardiogenic shock, and lower LV ejection fraction at admission were independent predictors of late recovery. At 4-year follow-up, the adjusted risk of death was significantly higher in patients with late recovery compared with those with early recovery (16.0% vs 8.6%, adjusted HR: 1.31; 95% CI: 1.12–1.60), with the risk of death increasing by 8% for every additional 10-day delay in time-to-LV recovery (adjusted HR: 1.08; 95% CI: 1.04–1.13).

Conclusions

Late recovery of LV function after TTS is associated with reduced short- and long-term survival. In TTS patients without early LV recovery, closer clinical follow-up might be considered.

### Tako-tsubo cardiomyopathy in severe sepsis: nationwide trends, predictors, and outcomes [^113g9tMV]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC) was first described in 1990 and has been increasingly recognized in clinical practice. 1 Labeled variably as apical‐ballooning syndrome, stress cardiomyopathy, and broken‐heart syndrome, TTC is characterized by transient regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction without obstructive coronary artery disease, precipitated by emotional and physical triggers. 1, 2 It is diagnosed most commonly in postmenopausal females, though it does occur in young women and males. 1, 3 Postulated pathogenesis includes myocardial stunning, catecholamine toxicity, and impaired myocyte metabolism. 4 Among the many proposed diagnostic criteria, TTC is most commonly diagnosed using the Mayo Clinic criteria: (1) transient hypokinesis, akinesias or dyskinesia of the left ventricular midsegments with or without apical involvement; (2) absence of obstructive coronary artery disease or angiographic evidence of acute plaque rupture; (3) new ECG abnormalities or modest elevation in cardiac troponins; and (4) absence of pheochromocytoma or myocarditis. 5

Patients admitted to intensive care units are subject to severe physical/emotional stress and catecholamine surges, which can potentially trigger TTC. Sepsis continues to be a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in intensive care units in the United States. 6 Multiorgan dysfunction is observed in up to 45% of patients presenting with sepsis and is associated with worse short‐term outcomes and long‐term organ dysfunction. 7, 8, 9 Cardiovascular dysfunction in sepsis can manifest as septic cardiomyopathy, TTC, refractory shock, and myocardial injury, resulting in worse mortality and morbidity. 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 Despite extensive data on septic cardiomyopathy, there are limited large‐scale epidemiological data on TTC in patients with severe sepsis. 1, 15 The aim of this study was to evaluate the trends and outcomes of TTC in patients with severe sepsis from a large US cohort.

### Mechanisms of stress (Takotsubo) cardiomyopathy [^114rcvcR]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2010). Medium credibility.

Stress cardiomyopathy, also referred to as Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, transient apical ballooning or broken heart syndrome, is a disorder associated with transient left ventricular dysfunction. Symptoms include acute chest pain and dyspnea accompanied by electrocardiographic changes, such as ST-segment elevation and T-wave inversions, minimal elevation of cardiac enzyme levels and transient wall-motion abnormalities in the absence of substantial coronary artery obstruction. Complete recovery of contractile function has been documented in nearly all cases, but the mechanisms of disease remain unclear and the cause has not been established. Coronary artery vasospasm, microcirculation dysfunction, and transient obstruction of the left ventricular outflow tract have been proposed as possible causes of this disorder. An excessive release of catecholamines also seems to have a pivotal role in the development of stress cardiomyopathy. This Review summarizes published data on stress cardiomyopathy, focusing primarily on the most likely causes of this cardiac entity.

### Short-and long-term prognosis of patients with Takotsubo syndrome based on different triggers: importance of the physical nature [^112MQ2Qa]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Since its first description in Japan in 1990, 1 Takotsubo syndrome (TTS), also known as stress cardiomyopathy, has emerged as an important form of transient ventricular systolic dysfunction that mimics an acute myocardial infarction, without evidence of complicated coronary artery disease. 2 Although the global pathophysiology of this syndrome is still unclear, it seems that the sympathetic neurohormonal axis plays a key role, and several pathogenic theories have been suggested. 3 Some of the most globally postulated include coronary vasospasm, endothelial dysfunction, catecholamine‐mediated toxicity, and alterations at the level of the hypothalamic‐pituitary‐adrenal axis. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

In several cases, emotional stress can be evidenced as a trigger that has led to the popular term "broken heart syndrome". 10 Some researchers propose a classification of patients according to the nature of the trigger, and as such, this emotionally triggered TTS should be considered TTS, whereas other cases with similar clinical conditions, but triggered by physical factors (surgery, hemorrhages, infections, etc), should be considered "Takotsubo‐like syndrome" instead. 11 However, the Mayo Clinic criteria, modified in 2008, include all patients in the spectrum of global TTS, regardless of the nature of the triggering factor. 10 Our group has proposed a TTS classification based on the triggers, differentiating between primary (triggered by psychological stress or without an identifiable trigger) and secondary forms (precipitated by physical factors). 12 This is of the utmost importance, because secondary TTS could present a worse short‐ and long‐term prognosis in terms of mortality, recurrences, and readmissions. 12 Recently, a classification for TTS has been proposed based on its possible prognostic implications, extracted from the InterTAK (International Takotsubo) registry. 13 However, the prognostic impact of this classification has not been confirmed in external cohorts that allow its usefulness to be validated. On the basis of this, we propose this study, which infers the idea of the prognostic importance of triggers in TTS.

In the final analysis, it should be remembered that patients with takotsubo syndrome are neither tachycardic nor hypertensive at presentation, and this contrasts with all other conditions known to have high catecholamine surges. Thus, takotsubo syndrome might affect the autonomic nervous system in a much more complex way than a simple and pure catecholamine surge.

### Takotsubo cardiomyopathy as a complication of electroconvulsive therapy [^117Gxf9V]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the evidence regarding takotsubo cardiomyopathy as a complication of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT).

Data Sources

Searches in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1966-August 2011) were conducted.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Published studies and case reports that mentioned takotsubo cardiomyopathy following ECT were reviewed.

Data Synthesis

Twelve case reports were available for review. There were 7 documented cases of takotsubo cardiomyopathy, 4 cases of myocardial stunning, and 1 case of cardiogenic shock following ECT. Although takotsubo cardiomyopathy was not mentioned in 5 of the cases, some clinical characteristics were consistent with this diagnosis. Left ventricular ejection fraction and the electrocardiogram returned to normal within a few days in the majority of the cases. All cases were in women, the majority of whom were postmenopausal (average age 64 years). Takotsubo cardiomyopathy developed after a single course of ECT in 6 of the cases, while the syndrome developed after more than 1 course in the other 6 cases. ECT was successfully readministered without syndrome recurrence in 4 of the cases, but only after 3 of the 4 patients received a β-adrenergic receptor blocking agent prior to each subsequent therapy session. The β-adrenergic blocking agents used were esmolol in 1 case and labetolol in the other 2.

Conclusions

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is a serious but transient potential complication of electroconvulsive therapy. Limited evidence indicates that β-adrenergic receptor blocking agents may help prevent its reoccurrence in patients needing further electroconvulsive treatment. Health care providers in psychiatry should be aware of this potential complication of electroconvulsive therapy, especially in postmenopausal women. However, many questions remain regarding this issue.

### A simple procedure in a complex patient: perioperative Takotsubo cardiomyopathy [^114JybHM]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Background

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC) is a rare but life-threatening condition characterised by transient left ventricular (LV) wall motion abnormality occurring in the abscence of coronary artery disease. First described in 1990, its presentation mimics an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and is thought to comprise approximately 1%–2% of patients presenting with symptoms of ACS. While several mechanisms have been suggested to explain its pathogenesis, the most widely accepted hypothesis suggests a catecholamine surge causing a 'stunning' of the myocardium, leading to transient LV dysfunction. This is supported by stress (physical or emotional) being implicated as a trigger for TTC. The incidence of perioperative TTC is estimated to be 1/6700 cases. Diagnosis is typically based on meeting the clinical criteria as outlined by the Mayo clinic in 2008 (box 1). While other criteria have been proposed, the Mayo criteria is most widely accepted and used. Management is generally aimed at managing myocardial ischaemia with oxygen, anticoagulation (until a diagnosis of coronary artery disease is excluded) and beta-blockers.

Box 1
Mayo criteria for diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (reprinted with permission from Prasad et al)

Transient hypokinesis, akinesis/dyskinesis of the left ventricular mid segments, with or without apical involvement.
Absence of obstructive coronary disease.
New ECG abnormalities - > ST elevation/T inversion or modest increase in troponin.
Absence of pheocromocytoma and myocarditis.

Cases of TTC are often associated with increased levels of serum catecholaminesand therefore agents that increase catecholamines (such as Selective Noradrenaline Re-uptake Inhibitors (SNRIs)) may be a contributing factor in development of the condition. The report below outlines a case of perioperative TTC in a patient taking duloxetine along with other precipitating factors.

### Takotsubo cardiomyopathy in the setting of thyroid storm [^115Tq1JW]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Our case further highlights the importance having increased awareness among clinicians of the potential role of abnormal thyroid hormone levels in Takotsubo cardiomyopathy and to consider ordering appropriate thyroid function tests and institution of appropriate therapy.

Patient's perspective

It was a terrifying experience but I am extremely grateful for what the doctors have done to diagnose and manage my condition.

Learning points

Patients with thyrotoxicosis can develop cardiovascular complications that include tachyarrhythmias (atrial fibrillation, atrial ectopics, etc), and Takotsubo cardiomyopathy should be increasingly noted as a potential complication.
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is a differential diagnosis in patients presenting with symptoms consistent with acute coronary syndrome.
Following diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, investigation for underlying hyperthyroidism is recommended.
Treatment of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy should include treating the aetiology of the disease as well as institution of heart failure medications.
More studies are required to determine the exact pathophysiology of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.

Recurrence

Patients who survive the initial event have a second event in approximately 5% of cases, mostly occurring 3 weeks to 3.8 years after the first event. Recurrent TTS afflicts men and women and may occur at any age including in childhood. Both the triggering event and the ballooning pattern may differ during recurrent events. Some have postulated that an index TTS event may protect the affected LV regions from recurrent involvement through a mechanism akin to ischaemic 'pre-conditioning'. However, detailed review of published cases and clinical experience suggest that there are frequent examples of recurrence in which the ballooning pattern is similar between episodes, thereby making this hypothesis unlikely.

### Stress (Takotsubo) cardiomyopathy – a novel pathophysiological hypothesis to explain catecholamine-induced acute myocardial stunning [^116sZt2v]. Nature Clinical Practice: Cardiovascular Medicine (2008). Medium credibility.

Stress cardiomyopathy, also referred to as Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, is an increasingly recognized clinical syndrome characterized by acute reversible apical ventricular dysfunction. We hypothesize that stress cardiomyopathy is a form of myocardial stunning, but with different cellular mechanisms to those seen during transient episodes of ischemia secondary to coronary stenoses. In this syndrome, we believe that high levels of circulating epinephrine trigger a switch in intracellular signal trafficking in ventricular cardiomyocytes, from G(s) protein to G(i) protein signaling via the beta(2)-adrenoceptor. Although this switch to beta(2)-adrenoceptor-G(i) protein signaling protects against the proapoptotic effects of intense activation of beta(1)-adrenoceptors, it is also negatively inotropic. This effect is greatest at the apical myocardium, in which the beta-adrenoceptor density is greatest. Our hypothesis has implications for the use of drugs or devices in the treatment of patients with stress cardiomyopathy.

Background

COVID-19, also known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which originated in China in late 2019, has spread rapidly resulting in a global pandemic. The cardiovascular complications remain under investigation. Here, we present a case of Takotsubo syndrome in a patient with COVID-19 infection.

### Reverse Takotsubo cardiomyopathy in the setting of anaphylaxis treated with high-dose intravenous epinephrine [^114vxumj]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is seen, though rarely, in anaphylaxis treated with epinephrine. Stress cardiomyopathy is most likely to occur in middle-aged women. The underlying etiology is believed to be related to catecholamine release in periods of intense stress. Catecholamines administered exogenously, and those secreted by neuroendocrine tumors (e.g., pheochromocytoma) or during anaphylaxis have been reported to cause apical ballooning syndrome, or takotsubo syndrome. However, reverse takotsubo stress cardiomyopathy is rarely seen or reported in anaphylaxis treated with epinephrine.

Objectives

To report a case illustrating that high-dose intravenous epinephrine can trigger stress cardiomyopathy, and that the risk is heightened with inappropriate dosing in the treatment of anaphylaxis.

Case Report

We report a rare case of iatrogenic reverse takotsubo syndrome in a young woman who was inappropriately treated with high-dose intravenous epinephrine for mild anaphylaxis.

Conclusion

Inappropriately high doses of intravenous epinephrine can trigger stress cardiomyopathy. Emergency physicians should be familiar with the diagnosis, grading, and appropriate treatments of anaphylaxis to avoid this unnecessary complication.

### Acute biopsy-proven lymphocytic myocarditis mimicking Takotsubo cardiomyopathy [^112Rhi7K]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2009). Low credibility.

Endomyocardial biopsy (EMB), the diagnostic gold standard for myocarditis, has not been systematically performed in the reported case series of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, although proposed Mayo Criteria specify exclusion of myocarditis. Moreover, there is no specific recommendation for infarct-like acute myocarditis in the recently published guidelines on the role of EMB. Here we present a thoroughly documented case fulfilling both the proposed Mayo criteria for Takotsubo cardiomyopathy and the World Health Organization criteria for active, virus-negative, immune-mediated myocarditis. Since myocarditis can mimic acute myocardial infarction with normal coronary arteries, EMB should be performed to rule out myocarditis in patients presenting with LV apical ballooning syndrome (or Takotsubo cardiomyopathy).

### A signature of circulating microRNAs differentiates Takotsubo cardiomyopathy from acute myocardial infarction [^111S8MHM]. European Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

This study for the first time reports (i) a novel signature of four circulating miRNAs allowing to distinguish TTC from STEMI patients in an acute setting; (ii) that stress- and depression-related miRNAs are up-regulated in this setting in line with known triggers of TTC; and (iii) that ET-1, a possible mediator of myocardial ischaemia in TTC, is produced at increased amounts in parallel to an down-regulation of the ET-1-regulating miRNA125a-5p. Thus, this study provides novel insights into both the diagnosis and pathogenesis of TTC.

Biomarkers remain an essential tool in daily clinical practice for diagnosis, risk prediction, and therapeutic decision-making, particularly in the emergency setting. Biomarkers also contribute to the understanding of the pathomechanisms of a given disease. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy essentially mimics acute MI in clinical presentation and a profile of common cardiac necrosis biomarkers that hampers a rapid diagnosis. Today, no biomarker exists to differentiate TTC from MI in the acute phase. Sampling of circulating plasma miRNAs represents a potential new approach for non-invasive and rapid diagnostic screening using polymerase chain reaction. In the present study, we identified for the first time a unique signature of differentially regulated miRNAs distinguishing patients with TTC from those with STEMI (sensitivity 96.77%, specificity 70.37%) and healthy subjects (sensitivity 74.19%, specificity 78.57%). The predictive accuracy of our miRNA signature distinguishing TTC from STEMI patients and healthy subjects was similar to those recently published to differentiate acute MI from non-MI patients.

### Differences in the clinical profile and outcomes of typical and atypical Takotsubo syndrome: data from the international Takotsubo registry [^111b8UoD]. JAMA Cardiology (2016). Medium credibility.

Importance

Apical ballooning is broadly recognized as the classic form of takotsubo syndrome (TTS). Atypical subtypes of TTS also exist, which constitute about 20% of all cases. To date, clinical profile and course of atypical TTS types have rarely been studied.

Objective

To characterize the clinical profile and outcomes of typical vs atypical types of TTS in a large patient cohort.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Records of 1750 patients from the International Takotsubo Registry, comprising 26 participating cardiovascular centers in 9 different countries, were reviewed and data on clinical profile and outcomes collected from January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2014.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Clinical characteristics and in-hospital as well as long-term outcomes were assessed.

Results

Of 1750 patients diagnosed with TTS between 1998 and 2014, a total of 1430 (81.7%) presented with apical TTS (defined as typical TTS) and 320 (18.3%) with midventricular, basal, or focal TTS (all defined as atypical TTS). Patients with atypical TTS were younger than those with typical TTS (mean [SD], 62.5 [13.3] vs 67.3 [12.9] years; P < .001). Brain natriuretic peptide levels on admission were lower (median factor increase of the upper limit of normal, 4.18 vs 6.59; P = 0.02) and left ventricular ejection fraction was higher (mean [SD], 43.4% [10.7%] vs 40.6% [12.0%]; P < .001) in patients with atypical than those with typical forms of TTS. ST-segment depression was more prevalent in patients with atypical TTS (31 of 286 [10.8%] vs 90 of 1292 [7.0%]; P = 0.03), while ST-segment elevation was found more frequently in patients with typical TTS (593 of 1292 [45.9%] vs 97 of 286 [33.9%]; P < .001). Patients with atypical TTS more often had neurologic disorders than those with typical TTS (81 of 274 [29.6%] vs 286 of 1251 [22.9%]; P = 0.02). While in-hospital mortality was comparable between patients with atypical and typical TTS (10 of 320 [3.1%] vs 62 of 1430 [4.3%]; P = 0.32), the atypical forms showed a favorable outcome at 1 year (P = 0.01). However, after adjustment for confounders, only left ventricular ejection fraction less than 45%, atrial fibrillation, and neurologic disease, but not the type of TTS, were independent predictors. After 1 year, patients with both types of TTS showed a similar prognosis at long-term follow-up.

Conclusions and Relevance

Atypical TTS has different characteristics than typical TTS, including younger age of onset, more frequent ST-segment depression, higher prevalence of neurologic diseases, less pronounced reduction in left ventricular ejection fraction, and lower brain natriuretic peptide values on admission. Outcomes are comparable between patients with both types after adjustment for confounders, suggesting that both should be equally monitored.

### Takotsubo cardiomyopathy in a recently widowed woman… [^116ZqpRy]. AAFP (2009). Low credibility.

to the editor: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is a transient condition that occurs most commonly in older women and is triggered by intense emotional or physical stress. It is characterized by transient akinesis or dyskinesis of the apical and midventricular segments of the left ventricle in association with regional wall motion abnormalities. A 74-year-old black woman with a history of hypertension presented with complaints of weakness and chest pain a few days after the death of her husband whom she had been married to for 35 years. Her examination revealed a blood pressure of 186/88 mm Hg and tachycardia. Electrocardiography showed ST-segment elevation in leads V. 3 through V 6, and deep T-wave inversions in leads V 3 through V 6 and in leads II, III, and aVF. Cardiac enzyme levels were normal. Cardiac catheterization showed no coronary artery stenosis.

However, left ventriculography showed apical ballooning in diastole and systole. Echocardiography showed an ejection fraction of 25 percent and ballooning of the left ventricle. The shape of the ventricle resembled that of an octopus trap, confirming the diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. The patient was treated with beta blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and aspirin. Two weeks later, repeat echocardiography showed a normal ejection fraction and normal shape of the left ventricle. ECG showed complete resolution of the ST-segment elevation and absence of Q-wave formation. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is an increasingly reported syndrome characterized by reversible ballooning of the left ventricular apex in the absence of significant coronary artery disease. The clinical presentation is similar to myocardial ischemia with ECG changes of ST elevation and T-wave inversion but normal coronary angiography.

The exact pathology is unclear, but a role for the sympathetic nervous system has been proposed. Management involves a combination of drugs that improve left ventricular systolic dysfunction, as necessary for volume overload. Because this condition is transient, long-term treatment is not required. The prognosis is good with complete left ventricular systolic function recovery typically occurring within weeks. 1–3.

### Diagnostic utility of cardiac biomarkers in discriminating Takotsubo cardiomyopathy from acute myocardial infarction [^115YRjpM]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2014). Low credibility.

Background: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TC) mimics acute myocardial infarction (AMI). We postulated that ventricular dysfunction in TC in the absence of significant myocardial necrosis would produce higher B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP)/troponin T (TnT) and BNP/creatine kinase MB fraction (CKMB) ratios than in AMI. Methods and Results: We studied 58 consecutive TC (age 65.8 ± 12.9) and 97 AMI patients (age 59.8 ± 13.4). The ratios of BNP/TnT and BNP/CKMB were calculated with the use of first simultaneously drawn laboratory values. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to distinguish TC from AMI with 95% specificity based on cardiac biomarker ratios. Median BNP/TnT and BNP/CKMB ratios were, respectively,1,292 [interquartile range 443.4–2,657.9] and 28.44 [13.7–94.8] in the TC group and 226.9[69.91–426.32] and 3.63 [1.07–10.02] in the AMI group (P < .001). TC can be distinguished from AMI with 95% specificity with the use of BNP/TnT ratio ≥ 1,272 (sensitivity 52%) and BNP/CKMB ratio ≥ 29.9 (sensitivity 50%). Conclusions: The value of BNP is significantly higher in TC than in AMI. Early BNP/TnT and BNP/CKMB ratios help to differentiate TC from AMI with greater accuracy than BNP alone.

### Incidence and clinical impact of recurrent Takotsubo syndrome: results from the GEIST registry [^1112SyD8]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Takotsubo syndrome (TTS) is characterized by a transient ventricular dysfunction. Patients have symptoms mimicking an acute coronary syndrome. 1, 2 Despite the transient character of TTS, a significant number of adverse events has been reported. 3 Mainly in the short‐term phase of TTS, patients are experiencing arrhythmias, including sudden cardiac death, 4, 5, 6 cardiogenic shock, 7 and thromboembolic events, including stroke. 8, 9 First, it has been thought that TTS may affect only the left ventricle (LV), whereas some years later right ventricular or biventricular involvement has been also reported. 10, 11 The recovery of these wall motion abnormalities is observed within days to weeks. The following 4 different TTS forms have been reported to date: apical form, midventricular form, basal form, and rare focal form. 12, 13 In the past decade, different studies have shown that TTS is not associated with a favorable prognosis, with a mortality rate comparable to that of acute coronary syndrome. 3, 14

Current literature reports a recurrence rate of 1% to 6%. 15, 16, 17 However, these data are inconsistent and frequently limited by its single‐center character. Moreover, it is not known which patients are at risk for recurrence and if the presence of TTS recurrences is associated with future cardiovascular events or mortality. In view of these limitations, we sought to comprehensively describe the incidence, clinical characteristics, predictors, and impact of recurrence in TTS in a large multicenter European registry.

### Acute stress induces long-term metabolic, functional, and structural remodeling of the heart [^113PDh9L]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Stress is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases in patients with pre-existing cardiac diseases or cardiovascular risk factors, as well as in persons without a known cardiac condition. A spectacular consequence of acute stress on the heart is Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC), a condition mimicking an acute coronary syndrome but in which coronarography appears normal. In the absence of other signs of associated or underlying cardiac conditions, TTC patients are dismissed from hospitals because the acute cardiac symptoms (pain, electrocardiography, heart rate, blood pressure…) are reversible and because there is no evidence of coronary obstruction. However, recent long-term follow-up studies have reported similar cardiovascular annual death rates for TTC and for proven acute coronary obstruction, suggesting that TTC often induces severe cardiac sequelae.

### ECG criteria to differentiate between Takotsubo (stress) cardiomyopathy and myocardial infarction [^112DZ2xh]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Twelve‐lead surface ECG on admission is a simple diagnostic tool that is available in a primary emergency setting. Although several studies have proposed ECG characteristics to differentiate between TTC and acute MI, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 data are still insufficient, partially due to limited sample size and the heterogeneity of study designs. Most of these studies compared TTC only to anterior MI. However, admission ECGs of TTC patients can vary, and the degree of ST‐elevation, ST‐depression, and T‐inversion is considerably different (11–100%). Some patients may even present with a normal ECG. 3, 5, 17, 18 This makes it more clinically relevant to define ECG findings specific to TTC compared to all MI patients, where the differential diagnosis is a question. In the current study, we compared not only admission ECGs between TTC and acute MI but we further dichotomized into TTC with ST‐elevation versus STEMI and TTC without ST‐elevation versus NSTEMI, and we defined specific ECG changes that differentiate between both entities. Moreover, we considered ST‐segment deviation at the J point as recommended by the third universal definition of MI, 20 since this can affect the presence or absence of ST‐elevation. We also classified ECG leads by localization‐based ECG criteria (anterior, inferior, and lateral), which are easy to apply in the clinical setting. The patients with TTC in our study were predominantly postmenopausal women (91% with mean age of 65 years) and had lower rates of smoking history, dyslipidemia, and diabetes compared to MI patients, in accordance with previous publications. 8, 22 Our results confirmed the heterogeneity of ECG at the time of presentation in both TTC and MI, with a comparable rate of ST‐elevation, as well as a similar rate of normal ECGs, which supports the choice of our study design.

### Evaluation of recurrent Takotsubo Syndrome [^111JkUnb]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Takotsubo syndrome (TTS) is a form of acute-onset heart failure associated with sympathetic activation that most often occurs following an intense emotional or physical stressor, and is predominantly seen in menopausal women. The presentation of TTS mimics an acute myocardial infarction — approximately 5% of women with suspected acute myocardial infarction who undergo coronary angiography actually have TTS. While the ventricular dysfunction in TTS is typically reversible, the initial presentation carries a risk of severe complications including cardiogenic shock, arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest, with an in-hospital mortality similar to acute myocardial infarction.

After resolution of the acute event, more recent work has challenged the prior notion of a benign long-term prognosis in TTS. There is mounting evidence that the long-term mortality after TTS is higher than in the general population and similar to that of patients after an acute myocardial infarction. Reports suggest a longer-term heart failure phenotype with persistent cardiac symptoms and cardiac structural abnormalities on advanced imaging techniques more than 1 year after the TTS event, and increased heart failure hospitalizations compared with matched controls. A significant subset of patients, estimated at 4 to 12% in prior studies, experience a recurrent TTS event, even years after the initial event and are thereby re-exposed to the risk of severe complications during the acute period.

A characterization of recurrent TTS is therefore important to understand the risk of long-term morbidity and mortality associated with the disease. Furthermore, while population studies investigating incident disease are impractical in this relatively uncommon and under-recognized syndrome, the study of recurrent events can provide valuable insight into pathophysiology and prospective risk. In particular, we hypothesized that a detailed investigation of psychosocial factors would provide important insight, given the role for psychosocial stress in the pathophysiology of TTS, and the known importance of adverse psychosocial features in other cardiovascular conditions, including an association with recurrent myocardial infarction. There have not been consistent demographic, clinical, and echocardiographic predictors of recurrent TTS events in prior single-center studies and multicenter registries. Accordingly, in a population with prior TTS, we conducted a detailed examination of clinical, echocardiographic, and invasive parameters, as well as patient-reported measures of psychological stress, to evaluate recurrent TTS.

### Inverted-Takotsubo pattern cardiomyopathy secondary to pheochromocytoma: a clinical case and literature review [^116S6t6e]. Clinical Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is an increasingly recognized clinical syndrome of transient left ventricular dysfunction, commonly with apical ballooning, in the context of physical or emotional stress. Recently, an inverted-Takotsubo contractile pattern has been described with hypokinesis of the basal and mid-ventricular segments and sparing of the apex. We report a case of a 30-year-old man presenting with transient left ventricular dysfunction in an inverted-Takotsubo contractile pattern, associated with a newly discovered pheochromocytoma, and present a literature review of the inverted-Takotsubo contractile pattern cardiomyopathy.

### Renin-angiotensin and endothelin systems in patients post-Takotsubo cardiomyopathy [^113t1FcS]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

We investigate if renin‐angiotensin and endothelin‐1 response pathways follow the same pattern of recovery as left ventricular ejection fraction in patients with takotsubo cardiomyopathy.

Methods and Results

Ninety patients with takotsubo cardiomyopathy (n = 30 in each of "acute", "convalescent" [3–5 months] and "recovered" [> 1 year] groups) who were on minimal or no medication and were free of any significant cardiac/metabolic comorbidities, and 30 controls were studied. Serum concentrations of renin, angiotensin‐converting enzyme, angiotensin II, big endothelin‐1, endothelin‐1 were measured using commercially available ELISA, and B‐type natriuretic peptide was measured using an immunoassay. Mean left ventricular ejection fraction was < 40% during the acute phase in all groups, but recovered to 63% in convalescent and 64% in the recovered groups, respectively. Serum renin concentrations remain persistently elevated after a episode of takotsubo cardiomyopathy (P = 0.03 versus controls). Angiotensin converting enzyme levels are significantly depressed during the acute phase compared with convalescent (P = 0.004), recovered takotsubo cardiomyopathy (P = 0.02) or controls (P = 0.03). Angiotensin II is increased in patients with takotsubo cardiomyopathy (P < 0.001 versus controls) remaining persistently elevated in the chronically recovered group alone (P = 0.03 versus controls). Big endothelin‐1 levels are unchanged, but endothelin‐1 is significantly lower after takotsubo cardiomyopathy compared with controls (P = 0.03).

Conclusions

Despite "normalization" of the left ventricular ejection fraction, there is long‐term maladaptive activation of renin‐angiotensin system in patients with takotsubo cardiomyopathy.

### Delayed contrast enhancement in MRI in Takotsubo cardiomyopathy [^117M5r7c]. BMJ Case Reports (2011). Medium credibility.

We present a 21-year-old female whose clinical presentation and investigations were suggestive of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. On cardiac MRI, there was delayed gadolinium enhancement in apical and mid-segments with sparing of the base. Patient is in class III symptoms with ejection fraction of 24% at 1 year follow-up. This variant form of takotsubo cardiomyopathy with delayed contrast enhancement is associated with irreversible left ventricular dysfunction and poor outcome.

### Diagnostic utility of cardiac biomarkers in discriminating Takotsubo cardiomyopathy from acute myocardial infarction [^115nAVa6]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TC) mimics acute myocardial infarction (AMI). We postulated that ventricular dysfunction in TC in the absence of significant myocardial necrosis would produce higher B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP)/troponin T (TnT) and BNP/creatine kinase MB fraction (CKMB) ratios than in AMI.

Methods and Results

We studied 58 consecutive TC (age 65.8 ± 82.9) and 97 AMI patients (age 59.8 ± 83.4). The ratios of BNP/TnT and BNP/CKMB were calculated with the use of first simultaneously drawn laboratory values. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to distinguish TC from AMI with 95% specificity based on cardiac biomarker ratios. Median BNP/TnT and BNP/CKMB ratios were, respectively, 1,292 [interquartile range 443.4–2,657.9] and 28.44 [13.7–94.8] in the TC group and 226.9 [69.91–426.32] and 3.63 [1.07–10.02] in the AMI group (P < .001). TC can be distinguished from AMI with 95% specificity with the use of BNP/TnT ratio ≥ 1,272 (sensitivity 52%) and BNP/CKMB ratio ≥ 29.9 (sensitivity 50%).

Conclusions

The value of BNP is significantly higher in TC than in AMI. Early BNP/TnT and BNP/CKMB ratios help to differentiate TC from AMI with greater accuracy than BNP alone.

### A novel and simple cardiac magnetic resonance score (PERT) predicts outcome in Takotsubo syndrome [^111mSxTn]. European Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Takotsubo syndrome (TTS), also known as broken heart syndrome or stress-induced cardiomyopathy, is an acute transient cardiomyopathy characterised by left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction with reversible regional wall motion abnormalities (RWMA). The apical segments are most commonly affected by circumferential RWMA ("apical ballooning"); however, diverse atypical forms including midventricular, basal, and focal types exist. TTS is commonly associated with emotional or physical triggers and its clinical presentation often mimics acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

While the clinical spectrum and epidemiological features of TTS have become increasingly well characterized in recent decades, the data on its long-term prognosis is conflicting: TTS was widely believed to be a benign disease with favourable prognosis and complete recovery of LV systolic function. However, recent studies indicate that the long-term mortality rate of patients with TTS is much higher than expected and is comparable to or even exceeds that of patients with acute myocardial infarction. Previous outcome studies demonstrated that clinical and imaging parameters such as male sex, age, LV ejection fraction, physical trigger, right ventricular (RV) involvement, and non-apical ballooning were factors related to worse long-term prognosis.

Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is an important tool in the diagnostic work-up of suspected TTS as it can confirm its diagnosis and differentiate it from other causes of acute cardiac symptoms, such as acute myocarditis. CMR features of TTS are typically circumferential RWMA with corresponding myocardial oedema and absent ischemic or inflammatory late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) in regions of abnormal function. In addition, concomitant complications such as pericardial effusion, pleural effusion, RV involvement, or intraventricular thrombus, which have been described with poor outcomes, can be easily assessed on CMR. While the diagnostic utility of CMR in TTS is well established, its prognostic value remains poorly studied.

In this study, we explored the association between pathological CMR findings and the occurrence of long-term major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in TTS patients. In particular, easy-to-assess complications like the presence of pericardial and pleural effusions, RV involvement, or intraventricular thrombus, were analysed. The aim of the study was to find simple CMR imaging features associated with TTS outcomes that could be incorporated into an imaging-based score in the daily clinical routine of any cardiovascular imaging centre.

### Clinical features and outcomes of patients with malignancy and Takotsubo syndrome: observations from the international Takotsubo registry [^112U71pU]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Background Clinical characteristics and outcomes of takotsubo syndrome (TTS) patients with malignancy have not been fully elucidated. This study sought to explore differences in clinical characteristics and to investigate short- and long-term outcomes in TTS patients with or without malignancy. Methods and Results TTS patients were enrolled from the International Takotsubo Registry. The TTS cohort was divided into patients with and without malignancy to investigate differences in clinical characteristics and to assess short- and long-term mortality. A subanalysis was performed comparing long-term mortality between a subset of TTS patients with or without malignancy and acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients with or without malignancy. Malignancy was observed in 16.6% of 1604 TTS patients. Patients with malignancy were older and more likely to have physical triggers, but less likely to have emotional triggers compared with those without malignancy. Long-term mortality was higher in patients with malignancy (P < 0.001), while short-term outcome was comparable (P = 0.17). In a subanalysis, long-term mortality was comparable between TTS patients with malignancies and ACS patients with malignancies (P = 0.13). Malignancy emerged as an independent predictor of long-term mortality. Conclusions A substantial number of TTS patients show an association with malignancy. History of malignancy might increase the risk for TTS, and therefore, appropriate screening for malignancy should be considered in these patients.

### Takotsubo cardiomyopathy associated with thyrotoxicosis: a case report and review of the literature [^117Gnyh6]. Thyroid (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Takotsubo or stress-induced cardiomyopathy is a form of reversible cardiomyopathy commonly associated with emotional or physical stress. Thyrotoxicosis has been identified as a rare cause of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, with only 12 cases reported in the literature. Here, we report a case of thyroid storm presenting with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy in the setting of Graves' disease.

Patient Findings

A 71-year-old woman presented with abdominal pain, vomiting, confusion, and history of weight loss. She was initially diagnosed and treated for diabetic ketoacidosis at another hospital and was transferred to our hospital one day after initial presentation because of concern for acute coronary syndrome. A diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy was made on the basis of cardiac catheterization. At that time, she was diagnosed and treated for thyroid storm. Follow-up 7 weeks later revealed improvement of her cardiac function and near-normalization of thyroid hormone levels.

Summary

In this patient, who presented with symptoms of heart failure, acute coronary syndrome was initially considered, but the diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy associated with thyroid storm was ultimately made based on cardiac catheterization and laboratory investigation.

Conclusions

Thyrotoxicosis is associated with adverse disturbances in the cardiovascular system. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy could be a presenting manifestation of thyroid storm, perhaps related to excess catecholamine levels or sensitivity.

### Renin-angiotensin and endothelin systems in patients post-Takotsubo cardiomyopathy [^112VViZ1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Background We investigate if renin-angiotensin and endothelin-1 response pathways follow the same pattern of recovery as left ventricular ejection fraction in patients with takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Methods and Results Ninety patients with takotsubo cardiomyopathy (n = 30 in each of "acute", "convalescent" [3-5months] and "recovered" [> 1year] groups) who were on minimal or no medication and were free of any significant cardiac/metabolic comorbidities, and 30 controls were studied. Serum concentrations of renin, angiotensin-converting enzyme, angiotensin II, big endothelin-1, endothelin-1 were measured using commercially available ELISA, and B-type natriuretic peptide was measured using an immunoassay. Mean left ventricular ejection fraction was < 40% during the acute phase in all groups, but recovered to 63% in convalescent and 64% in the recovered groups, respectively. Serum renin concentrations remain persistently elevated after a episode of takotsubo cardiomyopathy (P = 0.03 versus controls). Angiotensin converting enzyme levels are significantly depressed during the acute phase compared with convalescent (P = 0.004), recovered takotsubo cardiomyopathy (P = 0.02) or controls (P = 0.03). Angiotensin II is increased in patients with takotsubo cardiomyopathy (P < 0.001 versus controls) remaining persistently elevated in the chronically recovered group alone (P = 0.03 versus controls). Big endothelin-1 levels are unchanged, but endothelin-1 is significantly lower after takotsubo cardiomyopathy compared with controls (P = 0.03). Conclusions Despite "normalization" of the left ventricular ejection fraction, there is long-term maladaptive activation of renin-angiotensin system in patients with takotsubo cardiomyopathy.

Therapeutic management

Guidelines regarding TTS management are lacking as no prospective randomized clinical trials have been performed in this patient population. Therapeutic strategies are therefore based on clinical experience and expert consensus (evidence level C). Table 1 reviews current data on medical management of TTS patientsbased of retrospective analysis, meta-analysis, and case series. Figure 7 summarizes a proposed therapeutic management approach for patients with TTS.

Pre-hospital treatment

As TTS is clinically difficult to distinguish from ACS, upon first presentation patients should be transferred to a cardiology unit with imaging capabilities and a cardiac catheterization laboratory and receive guideline based treatment of ACS, in particular aspirin, heparin, and if required morphine and oxygen. Patients with cardiogenic shock or post cardiac arrest require intensive care. Electrocardiogram monitoring is essential as a prolonged QT-interval may trigger malignant ventricular arrhythmias (torsades de pointes) and AV-block may occur.

### Takotsubo cardiomyopathy in the setting of thyroid storm [^115EGWdZ]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Background

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy presentation is a mimic of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Abnormal thyroid hormone concentrations have been reported in patients with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, but the causal association has not been fully established. Thyroid hormone excess leads to increased cardiac stimulation, manifesting with tachyarrhythmia, inotropy and hypermetabolism, and should be investigated in patients presenting with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.

### Morphologic pattern of late gadolinium enhancement in Takotsubo cardiomyopathy detected by early cardiovascular magnetic resonance [^112e46M2]. Clinical Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC) presents clinically as an acute coronary syndrome. It is characterized by transient left ventricular wall dyskinesis-akinesis, without significant epicardial coronary lesions. Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) sequences on cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) allow to clarify the pathophysiology in patients with chest pain, elevated troponin, and normal epicardial coronary arteries; in patients with TTC, previous studies have shown absence of LGE.

Hypothesis

Early CMR in Takotsubo patients could show a morphological pattern of LGE improving clinical diagnosis.

Methods

Between January 2005 and January 2007, 8 consecutive patients with TTC criteria underwent CMR within the first 3 days of admission. Cine, T2-weighted, and LGE images were acquired. Patient follow-up included clinical exam and imaging techniques: echocardiogram on days 3, 7, 30, and 60, and CMR at 3 months.

Results

Six patients had experienced a previous stressful situation. No significant lesions were found on coronary angiography, and wall motion improvement was noted at 15 (7–30) days. Median EFs at admission and recovery were 46.5% and 65%, respectively. Dyskinesis was midapical in 6 cases, apical in 1 case, and mid-ventricular in 1 case. Late gadolinium enhancement showed mild hyperenhancement in areas of abnormal wall motion, whereas normal segments had no contrast enhancement. On follow-up CMR, wall motion was normal without late enhancement.

Conclusions

Early CMR in TTC demonstrates a special morphological pattern of late gadolinium uptake that might correspond to localized inflammation and edema in the affected area, suggesting diffuse microcirculation damage rather than epicardial vessel involvement.

### Takotsubo cardiomyopathy caused by severe burn injury [^112jjmHj]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2012). Low credibility.

The purpose of this report is to describe the clinical course of a 12% TBSA burn injury with takotsubo cardiomyopathy and to discuss this lesser known diagnosis. The authors performed a case study with retrospective chart review and conducted a literature search. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is characterized by severe left ventricular dysfunction that is incited by severe psychological or physical stress. The patient's treatment course was complicated by the underlying cardiomyopathy requiring intubation, volume expansion, and vasoactive medications. After treatment for her burn injuries, her cardiac myopathy resolved, and she was discharged home. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy may be precipitated by burn injury. Treatment is supportive, but it should be instituted quickly to avoid complications.

### Long-term prognosis and outcome predictors in Takotsubo syndrome: a systematic review and meta-regression study [^113TooB2]. JACC: Heart Failure (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

This study assessed the incidence of long-term adverse outcomes in patients with Takotsubo syndrome (TTS).

Background

The long-term prognosis of TTS is controversial. It is also unclear whether presenting characteristics are associated with the subsequent long-term prognosis.

Methods

We searched the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases and reviewed cited references up to March 31, 2018, to identify studies with > 6 months of follow-up data.

Results

Overall, we selected 54 studies that included a total of 4,679 patients (4,077 women and 602 men). Death during admission occurred in 112 patients (2.4%), yielding a frequency of 1.8% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.2% to 2.5%), with significant heterogeneity (I 2 = 78%; p < 0.001). During a median follow-up of 28 months (interquartile range: 23 to 34 months), 464 of 4,567 patients who the survived index admission died (103 because of cardiac causes and 351 because of noncardiac issues). The annual rate of total mortality was 3.5% (95% CI: 2.6% to 4.5%), with significant heterogeneity (I 2 = 74%; p < 0.001). Overall, 104 cases of recurrence of TTS were detected during follow-up, yielding a 1.0% annual rate of recurrence (95% CI: 0.7% to 1.3%), without significant heterogeneity (I 2 = 39%; p = 0.898). Meta-regression analysis showed that long-term total mortality in each study was significantly associated with older age (p = 0.05), physical stressor (p = 0.0001), and the atypical ballooning form of TTS (p = 0.009).

Conclusions

Our update analysis of patients discharged alive after TTS showed that long-term rates of overall mortality and recurrence were not trivial, and that some presenting features (older age, physical stressor, and atypical ballooning) were significantly associated with an unfavorable long-term prognosis.

Diagnostic workup

A diagnostic algorithm for takotsubo syndrome (TTS) is proposed by the expert committee (Figure 1). Patients presenting with ST-segment elevation should undergo urgent coronary angiography (CAG) with left ventriculography to exclude acute myocardial infarction (AMI). In patients with non ST-segment elevation the InterTAK Diagnostic Score can be considered. While an InterTAK Score ≤ 70 points suggests a low to intermediate probability of TTS, a score ≥ 70 indicates a high probability for the presence of TTS. Patients with a low probability should undergo CAG with left ventriculography, while in patients with a high score transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) should be considered. In the absence of a circumferential ballooning pattern CAG is recommended. In stable patients with circumferential ballooning pattern coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) is favoured to exclude coronary artery disease (CAD). In unstable patients, typical complications of TTS such as left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO) should be determined with TTE and CAG to safely rule out AMI. In patients with normal coronaries on CCTA or CAG and typical ballooning patterns without 'red flags' of acute infectious myocarditis TTS is the most likely diagnosis and can be confirmed after follow-up echocardiography. In case of positive 'red flags' of acute infectious myocarditis cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) should be performed to confirm the diagnosis.

### Is transient Takotsubo syndrome associated with cancer? Why, and with what implications for oncocardiology? [^1122pRCi]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Cardiomyopathies in TTS‐C

The present InterTAK registry presentation 1 did not clearly resolve 2 critical, potentially achievable TTS‐C–related points: (1) What are early and late causes of death after a TTS‐C episode? (Acute cardiac event? Cancer? Chronic cardiomyopathy?); and particularly (2) What are the causes of cardiomyopathy? It appears that reliable differentiation between TTS and diffuse (toxic) subacute/chronic chemotherapy‐related cardiac dysfunction 17 was not prospectively investigated by Cammann et al. 1 Knowing the difference between the 2 is critical for defining the clinical benefits or risks of chemotherapy in TTS‐C and for gauging the value of similar registry studies on late prognosis after TTS‐C. Recent estimates suggest that 10% of patients receiving chemotherapy have chronic cardiomyopathy, and 60% die within 2 years of diagnosis. 17, 18, 19 Generally, segmental and reversible cardiomyopathy is more likely to be TTS‐C related. Conversely, fixed or progressive diffuse cardiomyopathy is probably related not to coronary spasm, but to apoptosis, myocardiolysis, or interstitial fibrosis. 17, 18, 19 When the presentation is borderline, acetylcholine testing is an especially useful method for differentiating the 2 forms.

Incidentally, the importance of establishing a TTS‐C diagnosis is fundamental, as it can affect cardiological treatment decisions. Giza et al 20 recently published results from 275 patients admitted to a tertiary cancer center with an initial diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome; only 11% were diagnosed as probable TTS‐C, when studied by coronary angiography and follow‐up (no acetylcholine testing).
