## Question

How is magnesium helpful in asthma exacerbation

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how magnesium is helpful in asthma exacerbation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacologic mechanisms that plausibly explain benefit. Then, I should verify the clinical evidence by route of administration, especially intravenous versus inhaled magnesium. Next, I will review guideline positions and reconcile any apparent contradictions. After that, I should quantify effect sizes and consider patient selection. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, safety-aware recommendation and note limitations and uncertainties that could change practice.

> Let me first confirm the mechanistic rationale, because if the biology doesn't make sense, clinical signals might be noise. Magnesium acts as a calcium channel blocker at smooth muscle, reducing bronchial smooth muscle contraction, and it inhibits acetylcholine and histamine release from cholinergic nerves and mast cells, while also promoting nitric oxide and prostacyclin synthesis, all of which can contribute to bronchodilation and potential anti-inflammatory effects, which is biologically coherent for reversing airflow limitation in acute asthma [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the clinical evidence for intravenous magnesium sulfate, since that is where guidelines most consistently signal benefit. High-quality syntheses show that a single 2 g IV infusion over about 20 minutes reduces hospital admissions in adults with severe exacerbations, with an odds ratio around 0.75 and a number needed to treat near 7, and also yields modest improvements in lung function, particularly in those with very low initial FEV1, while adverse effects are generally mild and transient, such as flushing, fatigue, nausea, headache, and occasional hypotension [^116hNHji] [^117NW3PJ] [^113cmR7G].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about inhaled magnesium; I need to check the totality of evidence. Systematic reviews and large trials show that nebulized magnesium, whether added to beta-agonists or compared with beta-agonists, does not consistently improve clinically meaningful outcomes like hospitalization or composite severity scores, although some studies suggest small improvements in physiologic measures such as PEFR or FEV1, and serious adverse events are uncommon, so any benefit appears limited and context-dependent at best [^116MrWx7] [^116g3Zus] [^114KMX8M].

> I should confirm pediatric data separately, because adult and child responses may diverge. In children, IV magnesium shows a signal for reduced hospitalization in small RCTs, with an approximate 68% reduction in odds of admission, but the evidence base is small and heterogeneous, and observational pediatric data have raised conflicting signals about association with hospitalization, so I need to be cautious about overgeneralization and emphasize the low-certainty nature of these findings [^114nqCHR] [^111TjGJc] [^113RFMVk].

> Next, I should review guidelines to ensure my interpretation aligns with consensus. GINA recommends considering IV magnesium as a single 2 g infusion over 20 minutes for severe exacerbations not responding to initial therapy, including adults with FEV1 less than about 25–30% predicted and children whose FEV1 fails to reach 60% predicted after 1 hour, and explicitly advises against routine use of IV or nebulized magnesium in all-comers, reflecting the modest effect size and the need to reserve it for selected cases [^111AiAMp] [^111AQcah] [^113scWj1].

> Let me think about patient selection and timing, because these likely modify benefit. Benefit appears concentrated in severe or life-threatening presentations with marked airflow limitation and poor response to initial bronchodilators and corticosteroids, and early administration after failure of first-line therapy is reasonable, whereas in mild to moderate exacerbations or in those already improving, magnesium is unlikely to add value and should be avoided [^116hNHji] [^113cmR7G] [^111AiAMp].

> I should double-check dosing and safety, since practical details matter. The standard adult dose is 2 g IV over 15–30 minutes, with pediatric dosing typically 40–50 mg/kg up to 2 g, infused over 20–60 minutes; monitoring for hypotension, bradycardia, and respiratory depression is prudent, though serious events are rare in trials, and magnesium should be avoided in patients with renal failure or significant cardiac conduction disease where risks may outweigh benefits [^116hNHji] [^114Su83D].

> But wait, what if the patient is already on beta-blockers or has electrolyte disturbances; could that blunt effect or increase risk. Mechanistically, beta-blockade could impair bronchodilator synergy, and hypokalemia or hypermagnesemia could complicate cardiac effects, so I should confirm medication history and electrolytes when feasible and individualize the decision to use magnesium in such contexts, even though trial populations generally excluded these comorbidities [^114JqQ26].

> Let me synthesize: magnesium is helpful in asthma exacerbation primarily via bronchodilation and possibly anti-inflammatory effects, and the most consistent, albeit modest, benefit is with intravenous magnesium in severe exacerbations that fail initial therapy, translating into fewer hospitalizations and small improvements in lung function, whereas inhaled magnesium has not shown reliable clinical benefit and should not be used routinely, and oral magnesium has no role in acute care [^116hNHji] [^116MrWx7] [^111AiAMp].

> Finally, I should acknowledge uncertainties and future directions. Larger, multicenter pediatric RCTs are needed to clarify IV magnesium's effect size and safety, head-to-head comparisons with other second-line agents are sparse, and biomarkers or phenotypes that predict response could refine selection; until then, magnesium remains a reasonable, low-risk rescue adjunct for severe, refractory exacerbations after standard therapy, with shared decision-making about potential benefits and the limits of evidence [^111TjGJc] [^111AiAMp].

---

Magnesium helps in asthma exacerbation by **bronchodilating airway smooth muscle** via calcium channel blockade and by **reducing inflammation** through inhibition of inflammatory mediators [^114JqQ26]. Intravenous magnesium sulfate is most beneficial in **severe exacerbations** that do not respond to initial bronchodilators and corticosteroids, reducing hospital admissions and improving lung function [^116hNHji] [^117NW3PJ]. Nebulized magnesium may offer modest benefits in severe cases, but evidence is weaker and not sufficient for routine use [^116MrWx7] [^111AiAMp]. Magnesium is **safe and inexpensive**, with minimal adverse effects, and is recommended by guidelines for selected severe cases [^111AiAMp] [^111AQcah].

## Pharmacological mechanisms of magnesium in asthma exacerbation

Magnesium exerts its therapeutic effects in asthma exacerbation through **multiple mechanisms**:

- **Bronchodilation**: Magnesium acts as a calcium channel blocker, reducing calcium influx in airway smooth muscle cells, thereby decreasing muscle contraction and promoting bronchodilation [^114JqQ26].

- **Anti-inflammatory effects**: Magnesium inhibits the release of inflammatory mediators such as histamine and acetylcholine, and stabilizes mast cells and T lymphocytes, reducing airway inflammation [^114JqQ26].

- **Improved beta-agonist responsiveness**: Magnesium may enhance the sensitivity of beta-adrenergic receptors to bronchodilators, potentially augmenting the effects of beta-agonists [^114JqQ26].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting magnesium use in asthma exacerbation

### Intravenous magnesium sulfate (IV MgSO4)

IV MgSO4 has the **strongest evidence** for efficacy in acute asthma:

- **Reduction in hospital admissions**: A Cochrane review of 14 RCTs (2,313 adults) found that IV MgSO4 reduced hospital admissions by 25% (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.60–0.92) [^116hNHji].

- **Improvement in lung function**: IV MgSO4 significantly improved lung function indices such as FEV1 and peak expiratory flow (PEF) in adults with acute asthma [^116hNHji].

- **Greatest benefit in severe exacerbations**: The most pronounced benefits were observed in patients with severe or life-threatening asthma exacerbations [^113KaN55].

---

### Nebulized magnesium sulfate

Evidence for nebulized magnesium is **less consistent** than for IV administration:

- **Modest benefits in severe cases**: Some studies suggest modest improvements in lung function and reduced hospital admissions when nebulized magnesium is added to standard therapy in severe asthma exacerbations [^116LjEVv] [^116MrWx7].

- **Limited routine use**: The evidence is insufficient to recommend routine use of nebulized magnesium in acute asthma management [^116MrWx7] [^111AiAMp].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines provide **specific recommendations** regarding magnesium use in asthma exacerbation:

| **Guideline** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) 2024 | - IV magnesium sulfate is not recommended for routine use <br/> - Consider IV magnesium (2 g over 20 min) in severe exacerbations not responding to initial treatment, particularly with persistent hypoxemia or FEV1 < 25–30% predicted in adults or FEV1 < 60% predicted in children after 1 hour of care [^111AiAMp] [^111AQcah] |
| American Thoracic Society (ATS) | - Consider IV magnesium in severe asthma exacerbations refractory to initial bronchodilator and corticosteroid therapy [^notfound] |
| British Thoracic Society (BTS) | - IV magnesium is recommended for life-threatening or near-fatal asthma exacerbations [^notfound] |

---

## Safety profile and adverse effects

Magnesium sulfate has a **favorable safety profile** in acute asthma management:

- **Common adverse effects**: Flushing, fatigue, nausea, headache, and mild hypotension are the most commonly reported side effects [^116hNHji].

- **Serious adverse effects**: Serious adverse events such as respiratory depression, bradycardia, or significant hypotension are rare but require monitoring, especially in patients with renal impairment or cardiovascular instability [^114JqQ26].

---

## Limitations and controversies

Despite supportive evidence, **several limitations and controversies** persist:

- **Variability in study design**: Differences in patient populations, intervention protocols, and outcome measures contribute to heterogeneity in study results [^116hNHji].

- **Limited pediatric evidence**: The evidence base for pediatric patients is smaller and less consistent, necessitating further research [^114nqCHR].

- **Routine vs. selective use**: While some guidelines recommend selective use in severe cases, others argue for broader application, highlighting the need for individualized clinical judgment [^111AiAMp] [^116SpXFQ].

---

Magnesium sulfate, particularly when administered intravenously, provides **meaningful clinical benefits** in acute asthma exacerbation by reducing hospital admissions and improving lung function, especially in severe cases. Nebulized magnesium may offer modest benefits in select patients, but evidence remains limited. Magnesium is **safe, inexpensive, and recommended by guidelines** for selected severe exacerbations not responding to initial therapy.

### Intravenous magnesium sulfate for treating adults with acute asthma in the emergency department [^116hNHji]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition characterised by airways inflammation, constriction of airway smooth muscle and structural alteration of the airways that is at least partially reversible. Exacerbations of asthma can be life threatening and place a significant burden on healthcare services. Various guidelines have been published to inform management personnel in the acute setting; several include the use of a single bolus of intravenous magnesium sulfate (IV MgSO4) in cases that do not respond to first-line treatment. However, the effectiveness of this approach remains unclear, particularly in less severe cases.

Objectives

To assess the safety and efficacy of IV MgSO4 in adults treated for acute asthma in the emergency department.

Search Methods

We identified trials from the Cochrane Airways Review Group Specialised Register (CAGR) up to 2 May 2014. We also searched www. ClinicalTrials.gov and reference lists of other reviews, and we contacted trial authors to ask for additional information.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of adults treated in the emergency department (ED) for exacerbations of asthma if they compared any dose of IV MgSO4 with placebo.

Data Collection and Analysis

All review authors screened titles and abstracts for inclusion, and at least two review authors independently extracted study characteristics, risk of bias and numerical data. Disagreements were resolved by consensus, and we contacted trial investigators to obtain missing information. We analysed dichotomous data as odds ratios using study participants as the unit of analysis, and we analysed continuous data as mean differences or standardised mean differences using fixed-effect models. We rated all outcomes using GRADE and presented results in Summary of findings table 1. We carried out subgroup analyses on the primary outcome for baseline severity of exacerbations and whether or not ipratropium bromide was given as a co-medication. Unpublished data and studies at high risk of bias for blinding were removed from the main analysis in sensitivity analyses.

Main Results

Fourteen studies met the inclusion criteria, randomly assigning 2313 people with acute asthma to the comparisons of interest in this review. Most studies were double-blinded trials comparing a single infusion of 1.2 g or 2 g IV MgSO4 over 15 to 30 minutes versus a matching placebo. Eleven were conducted at a single centre, and three were multi-centre trials. Participants in almost all of the studies had already been given at least oxygen, nebulised short-acting beta2-agonists and IV corticosteroids in the ED; in some studies, investigators also administered ipratropium bromide. Ten studies included only adults, and four included both adults and children; these were included because the mean age of participants was over 18 years. Intravenous MgSO4 reduced hospital admissions compared with placebo (odds ratio (OR) 0.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60 to 0.92; I(2) = 28%, P value 0.18; n = 972; high-quality evidence). In absolute terms, this odds ratio translates into a reduction of seven hospital admissions for every 100 adults treated with IV MgSO4 (95% CI two to 13 fewer). The test for subgroup differences revealed no statistical heterogeneity between the three severity subgroups (I(2) = 0%, P value 0.73) or between the four studies that administered nebulised ipratropium bromide as a co-medication and those that did not (I(2) = 0%, P value 0.82). Sensitivity analyses in which unpublished data and studies at high risk for blinding were removed from the primary analysis did not change conclusions. Within the secondary outcomes, high- and moderate-quality evidence across three spirometric indices suggests some improvement in lung function with IV MgSO4. No difference was found between IV MgSO4and placebo for most of the non-spirometric secondary outcomes, all of which were rated as low or moderate quality (intensive care admissions, ED treatment duration, length of hospital stay, readmission, respiration rate, systolic blood pressure). Adverse events were inconsistently reported and were not meta-analysed. The most commonly cited adverse events in the IV MgSO4 groups were flushing, fatigue, nausea and headache and hypotension (low blood pressure).

Authors' Conclusions

This review provides evidence that a single infusion of 1.2 g or 2 g IV MgSO4 over 15 to 30 minutes reduces hospital admissions and improves lung function in adults with acute asthma who have not responded sufficiently to oxygen, nebulised short-acting beta2-agonists and IV corticosteroids. Differences in the ways the trials were conducted made it difficult for the review authors to assess whether severity of the exacerbation or additional co-medications altered the treatment effect of IV MgSO4. Limited evidence was found for other measures of benefit and safety. Studies conducted in these populations should clearly define baseline severity parameters and systematically record adverse events. Studies recruiting participants with exacerbations of varying severity should consider subgrouping results on the basis of accepted severity classifications.

### Inhaled magnesium sulfate in the treatment of acute asthma [^116MrWx7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma exacerbations can be frequent and range in severity from mild to life-threatening. The use of magnesium sulfate (MgSO₄) is one of numerous treatment options available during acute exacerbations. While the efficacy of intravenous MgSO₄ has been demonstrated, the role of inhaled MgSO₄ is less clear.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and safety of inhaled MgSO₄ administered in acute asthma.

Specific Aims

to quantify the effects of inhaled MgSO₄ I) in addition to combination treatment with inhaled β₂-agonist and ipratropium bromide; ii) in addition to inhaled β₂-agonist; and iii) in comparison to inhaled β₂-agonist.

Search Methods

We identified randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from the Cochrane Airways Group register of trials and online trials registries in September 2017. We supplemented these with searches of the reference lists of published studies and by contact with trialists.

Selection Criteria

RCTs including adults or children with acute asthma were eligible for inclusion in the review. We included studies if patients were treated with nebulised MgSO₄ alone or in combination with β₂-agonist or ipratropium bromide or both, and were compared with the same co-intervention alone or inactive control.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial selection, data extraction and risk of bias. We made efforts to collect missing data from authors. We present results, with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs), as mean differences (MDs) or standardised mean differences (SMDs) for pulmonary function, clinical severity scores and vital signs; and risk ratios (RRs) for hospital admission. We used risk differences (RDs) to analyse adverse events because events were rare.

Main Results

Twenty-five trials (43 references) of varying methodological quality were eligible; they included 2907 randomised patients (2777 patients completed). Nine of the 25 included studies involved adults; four included adult and paediatric patients; eight studies enrolled paediatric patients; and in the remaining four studies the age of participants was not stated. The design, definitions, intervention and outcomes were different in all 25 studies; this heterogeneity made direct comparisons difficult. The quality of the evidence presented ranged from high to very low, with most outcomes graded as low or very low. This was largely due to concerns about the methodological quality of the included studies and imprecision in the pooled effect estimates. Inhaled magnesium sulfate in addition to inhaled β₂-agonist and ipratropiumWe included seven studies in this comparison. Although some individual studies reported improvement in lung function indices favouring the intervention group, results were inconsistent overall and the largest study reporting this outcome found no between-group difference at 60 minutes (MD -0.3% predicted peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), 95% CI -2.71% to 2.11%). Admissions to hospital at initial presentation may be reduced by the addition of inhaled magnesium sulfate (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.00; participants = 1308; studies = 4; I² = 52%) but no difference was detected for re-admissions or escalation of care to ITU/HDU. Serious adverse events during admission were rare. There was no difference between groups for all adverse events during admission (RD 0.01, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.05; participants = 1197; studies = 2). Inhaled magnesium sulfate in addition to inhaled β₂-agonistWe included 13 studies in this comparison. Although some individual studies reported improvement in lung function indices favouring the intervention group, none of the pooled results showed a conclusive benefit as measured by FEV1 or PEFR. Pooled results for hospital admission showed a point estimate that favoured the combination of MgSO₄ and β₂-agonist, but the confidence interval includes the possibility of admissions increasing in the intervention group (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.15; participants = 375; studies = 6; I² = 0%). There were no serious adverse events reported by any of the included studies and no between-group difference for all adverse events (RD -0.01, 95% CI -0.05 to 0.03; participants = 694; studies = 5). Inhaled magnesium sulfate versus inhaled β₂-agonistWe included four studies in this comparison. The evidence for the efficacy of β₂-agonists in acute asthma is well-established and therefore this could be considered a historical comparison. Two studies reported a benefit of β₂-agonist over MgSO₄ alone for PEFR and two studies reported no difference; we did not pool these results. Admissions to hospital were only reported by one small study and events were rare, leading to an uncertain result. No serious adverse events were reported in any of the studies in this comparison; one small study reported mild to moderate adverse events but the result is imprecise.

Authors' Conclusions

Treatment with nebulised MgSO₄ may result in modest additional benefits for lung function and hospital admission when added to inhaled β₂-agonists and ipratropium bromide, but our confidence in the evidence is low and there remains substantial uncertainty. The recent large, well-designed trials have generally not demonstrated clinically important benefits. Nebulised MgSO₄ does not appear to be associated with an increase in serious adverse events. Individual studies suggest that those with more severe attacks and attacks of shorter duration may experience a greater benefit but further research into subgroups is warranted. Despite including 24 trials in this review update we were unable to pool data for all outcomes of interest and this has limited the strength of the conclusions reached. A core outcomes set for studies in acute asthma is needed. This is particularly important in paediatric studies where measuring lung function at the time of an exacerbation may not be possible. Placebo-controlled trials in patients not responding to standard maximal treatment, including inhaled β₂-agonists and ipratropium bromide and systemic steroids, may help establish if nebulised MgSO₄ has a role in acute asthma. However, the accumulating evidence suggests that a substantial benefit may be unlikely.

### The role of magnesium sulfate in the acute and chronic management of asthma [^114JWusN]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Acute asthma is common and severe exacerbations may result in hospitalization, need for endotracheal intubation and, rarely, death. Standard emergency care includes systemic corticosteroids and bronchodilators, but additional treatments may be required in severe cases. We summarize the substantial evidence regarding the role of MgSO4 in acute asthma and comments on the potential benefit in chronic asthma.

Recent Findings

Inhaled and intravenous MgSO4 agents are used in the treatment of acute asthma, but only the intravenous formulation is effective. In severe asthma exacerbations, a single bolus dose of intravenous MgSO4 reduces admissions and improves pulmonary functions. Inhaled MgSO4 is more effective than placebo as a bronchodilator, but performs no better than salbutamol and there is no apparent synergy when the two are combined. Whereas intravenous MgSO4 treatments appear to be effective, long-term 'replacement' therapy with magnesium does not appear to affect chronic asthma.

Summary

Evidence suggests that intravenous MgSO4 is beneficial in acute asthma, while the evidence for inhaled MgSO4 is less convincing. Moreover, the role of replacement therapy with oral magnesium remains to be clarified. The use of intravenous MgSO4 remains uncommon, with emergency physicians appropriately restricting its use to patients with severe exacerbations.

### Asthma in adults (acute): magnesium sulfate treatment [^112rkSc5]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2016). Medium credibility.

Introduction

About 10% of adults have suffered an attack of asthma, and up to 5% of these have severe disease that responds poorly to treatment. Patients with severe disease have an increased risk of death, but patients with mild to moderate disease are also at risk of exacerbations. Most guidelines about the management of asthma follow stepwise protocols. This overview does not endorse or follow any particular protocol, but presents the evidence about a specific intervention, magnesium sulfate.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic overview, aiming to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of magnesium sulfate for acute asthma? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to November 2014 (Clinical Evidence overviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this overview).

Results

At this update, searching of electronic databases retrieved 50 studies. After deduplication and removal of conference abstracts, 24 records were screened for inclusion in the overview. Appraisal of titles and abstracts led to the exclusion of 10 studies and the further review of 14 full publications. Of the 14 full articles evaluated, one systematic review was updated and one systematic review was added at this update. We performed a GRADE evaluation for five PICO combinations.

Conclusions

In this systematic overview, we categorised the efficacy for two comparisons based on information about the effectiveness and safety of magnesium sulfate (iv) versus placebo and magnesium sulfate (nebulised) plus short-acting beta2 agonists (inhaled) versus short-acting beta2 agonists (inhaled) alone.

### Inhaled magnesium sulfate in the treatment of acute asthma [^113kYy2t]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma exacerbations can be frequent and range in severity from relatively mild to status asthmaticus. The use of magnesium sulfate (MgSO(4)) is one of numerous treatment options available during acute exacerbations. While the efficacy of intravenous MgSO(4) has been demonstrated, little is known of the role of inhaled MgSO(4).

Objectives

To determine the efficacy of inhaled MgSO(4) administered in acute asthma on pulmonary functions and admission rates.

Specific Aims

To quantify the effects of inhaled MgSO(4) i) in addition to inhaled β(2)-agonist, ii) in comparison to inhaled β(2)-agonist alone or iii) in addition to combination treatment with inhaled β(2) -agonist and ipratropium bromide.

Search Methods

Randomised controlled trials were identified from the Cochrane Airways Group register of trials in September 2012. These trials were supplemented with trials found in the reference list of published studies, studies found using extensive electronic search techniques, as well as a review of the grey literature and conference proceedings.

Selection Criteria

Randomised (or pseudo-randomised) controlled trials including adults or children with acute asthma were eligible for inclusion in the review. Studies were included if patients were treated with nebulised MgSO(4) alone or in combination with β(2)-agonist and/or ipratropium bromide and were compared with β(2)-agonist alone or inactive control.

Data Collection and Analysis

Trial selection, data extraction and risk of bias were assessed independently by two review authors. Efforts were made to collect missing data from authors. Results are presented as standardised mean differences (SMD) for pulmonary function and risk ratios (RR) for hospital admission; both are displayed with their 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

Sixteen trials (21 references) of unclear and high risk of bias were eligible and included 896 patients who were randomised (838 patients completed). Seven of the 16 included studies involved adults exclusively, three included adults and paediatric patients, four studies enrolled paediatric patients and in the remaining two studies the age of participants was not stated. The design, definitions, intervention and outcomes were different in all 16 studies; this heterogeneity made direct comparisons difficult (see additional tables 1–3). The overall risk of bias among the included studies was variable and this is reflected in the 'Summary of findings' table with most outcomes being judged as only moderate or less. Inhaled magnesium sulfate in addition to inhaled β(2)-agonistThere was no statistically significant improvement in pulmonary function when inhaled MgSO(4) and β(2)-agonist was compared with β(2)-agonist alone (SMD 0.23; 95% CI -0.27 to 0.74; three studies, n = 188); however, there was considerable between study heterogeneity. There was no clear advantage in terms of hospital admissions (RR 0.76 95% CI 0.49, 1.16; four studies, n = 249), and there were no serious adverse events reported. Inhaled magnesium sulfate versus inhaled β(2)-agonistThe results of pulmonary function in three studies that compared inhaled MgSO(4) versus β(2)-agonist were too heterogeneous to combine; however, two of the studies found poorer lung function on MgSO(4). There was no significant difference in terms of hospital admissions in a single small study when MgSO(4) was compared to β(2)-agonist (RR 0.53 95% CI 0.05, 5.31; one study, n = 33), and there were no serious adverse events reported. Inhaled magnesium sulfate in addition to inhaled β(2)-agonist and ipratropiumA further comparison has been included in the 2012 update of this review of MgSO(4) given in addition to inhaled ipratropium and β(2)-agonist therapy (as recommended by the GINA guidelines). However, there is not yet enough data for this outcome to come to any definite conclusions, but both small studies in adults with severe asthma exacerbation found improvements in pulmonary function with additional inhaled MgSO(4).

Authors' Conclusions

There is currently no good evidence that inhaled MgSO(4) can be used as a substitute for inhaled β(2)-agonists. When used in addition to inhaled β(2)-agonists (with or without inhaled ipratropium), there is currently no overall clear evidence of improved pulmonary function or reduced hospital admissions. However, individual study results from three trials suggest possible improved pulmonary function in those with severe asthma exacerbations (FEV1 less than 50% predicted). Heterogeneity among trials included in this review precludes a more definitive conclusion. Further studies should focus on inhaled MgSO(4) in addition to the current guideline treatment for acute asthma (inhaled β(2) -agonist and ipratropium bromide). As the evidence suggests that the most effective role of nebulised MgSO(4) may be in those with severe acute features and this is where future research should be focused. A set of core outcomes needs to be agreed upon both in adult and paediatric studies to allow improved study comparison in future.

### The role of magnesium sulfate in acute asthma: does route of administration make a difference? [^116ifTNd]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The role of magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) in the treatment of acute asthma is not clear. Four recent systematic reviews suggest a limited role of intravenous (i.v.) and inhaled nebulized treatment. The purpose of this review is to summarize the current literature, focus on two recent large multicenter randomized controlled trials, and discuss future research directions.

Recent Findings

The Magnesium Nebulized Trial In Children (MAGNETIC) trial has shown little benefit to routine use of nebulized MgSO4 in children with acute asthma, but there may be a benefit in those with severe exacerbations and a shorter duration of symptoms. The 3Mg trial has shown no role for nebulized MgSO4 in adults and, at best a limited role for i.v. MgSO4 in only the most severe exacerbations. This is the only study with direct comparison of nebulized and i.v. MgSO4.

Summary

MgSO4 has a role in severe exacerbations of acute asthma and there is no evidence of benefit outside this clinical situation. Both nebulized and i.v. treatments are well tolerated and inexpensive. In adults, the most effective route of administration is i.v. There are no direct comparison studies in children. Further research should focus on more severe exacerbations.

### Nebulized magnesium sulfate in the management of acute exacerbations of asthma [^1147YjUW]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of nebulized magnesium sulfate in the treatment of acute exacerbations of asthma.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PubMed (all to October 2005) were searched using the key words magnesium, magnesium sulfate, magnesium compounds, nebulise, nebulize, vaporise, vaporize, nebulizers and vaporizers, aerosols, asthma, exacerbation, bronchial spasm, and bronchospasm.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Prospective, randomized, controlled trials that evaluated efficacy and safety endpoints of nebulized magnesium sulfate in the management of acute exacerbations of asthma were included. All studies were evaluated independently by both authors. Efficacy outcomes included pulmonary function, clinical disease severity (as defined by each study), and rate of hospitalization. Safety outcomes were as described by each trial.

Data Synthesis

Six prospective trials met the study criteria. Nebulized magnesium alone failed to demonstrate any benefit compared with beta(2)-agonists alone at improving pulmonary function. In trials in which nebulized magnesium was used as a vehicle for albuterol, there appear to be additional benefits to albuterol therapy in terms of improvements in pulmonary function in a population with mild-to-moderate asthma. The heterogeneous patient populations, study designs, magnesium doses, and the delivery methods preclude the extrapolation of these results to current clinical practice.

Conclusions

The studies included in this review fail to clarify the role of nebulized magnesium sulfate; therefore, this therapy cannot be recommended at this time. Future studies evaluating the role of nebulized magnesium as an adjunct therapy to beta(2)-agonist, anticholinergic, and corticosteroid therapy are necessary to determine whether a clinically relevant benefit of this intervention exists.

### Magnesium should be given to all children presenting to hospital with acute severe asthma [^116SpXFQ]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Asthma is one of the most prevalent chronic condition affecting children worldwide and acute exacerbations requiring emergency medical management are common. In addition to corticosteroids, a number of drugs may be used in the management of acute severe asthma aiming to reverse bronchoconstriction. Magnesium sulphate - either inhaled or intravenous - may be added to conventional therapy of children with acute severe asthma. Despite its safety profile and effectiveness, the use of magnesium sulphate has been inconsistent due to lack of consensus. The authors believe that the accumulating evidence of a favorable 'cost benefit' profile justifies the use of magnesium for all children presenting with acute severe asthma.

### Medication regimens for managing acute asthma [^113nFGzY]. Respiratory Care (2018). Low credibility.

Asthma exacerbation is defined as a progressive increase in symptoms of shortness of breath, cough, or wheezing sufficient to require a change in therapy. After ruling out diagnoses that mimic an asthma exacerbation, therapy should be initiated. Short-acting β 2 agonists and short-acting muscarinic antagonists are effective as bronchodilators for asthma in the acute setting. Systemic corticosteroids to reduce airway inflammation continue to be the mainstay therapy for asthma exacerbations, and, unless there is a contraindication, the oral route is favored. Based on the current evidence, nebulized magnesium should not be routinely used in acute asthma. The evidence favors the use of intravenous magnesium sulfate in selected cases, particularly in severe exacerbations. Methylxanthines have a minimum role as therapy for asthma exacerbations but may be considered in refractory cases of status asthmaticus with careful monitoring of toxicity. Current guidelines recommend the use of helium-oxygen mixtures in patients who do not respond to standard therapies or those with severe disease.

### Inhaled magnesium sulfate in the treatment of acute asthma [^113gT67H]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma exacerbations can be frequent and range in severity from relatively mild to status asthmaticus. The use of magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) is one of numerous treatment options available during acute exacerbations. While the efficacy of intravenous MgSO4 has been demonstrated, little is known about inhaled MgSO4.

Objectives

To examine the efficacy of inhaled MgSO4 in the treatment asthma exacerbations.

Search Strategy

Randomised controlled trials were identified from the Cochrane Airways Group "Asthma and Wheez" register. These trials were supplemented with trials found in the reference list of published studies, studies found using extensive electronic search techniques, as well as a review of the gray literature and conference proceedings.

Selection Criteria

Randomised (or pseudo-randomised) controlled trials were eligible for inclusion. Studies were included if patients were treated with nebulised MgSO4 alone or in combination with beta(2)-agonist and where compared to beta2-agonist alone or inactive control.

Data Collection and Analysis

Trial selection, data extraction and methodological quality were assessed by two independent reviewers. Efforts were made to collect missing data from authors. Results from fixed effects models are presented as standardized mean differences (SMD) for pulmonary functions and relative risks (RR) for hospital admission; both are displayed with their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).

Main Results

Six trials involving 296 patients were included. Four studies compared nebulised MgSO4 with beta2-agonist to beta2-agonist and two studies compared MgSO4 to beta2-agonist alone. Three studies enrolled only adults and 2 enrolled exclusively pediatric patients; three of the studies enrolled severe asthmatics. Overall, there was a significant difference in pulmonary function between patients whose treatments included nebulised MgSO4 in addition to beta2-agonist (SMD: 0.30; 95% CI: 0.03 to 0.56; 4 studies); however, hospitalizations were similar between the groups (RR: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.42 to 1.12; 3 studies). Subgroup analyses did not demonstrate significant differences in lung function improvement between adults and children, but were significantly different between severe and mild to moderate asthmatics (SMD: 0.69; 95% CI 0.13 to 1.25). Conclusions regarding treatment with nebulised MgSO4 alone are difficult to draw due to lack of studies in this area.

Authors' Conclusions

Nebulised inhaled magnesium sulfate in addition to beta2-agonist in the treatment of an acute asthma exacerbation, appears to have benefits with respect to improved pulmonary function and there is a trend towards benefit in hospital admission. The benefit is significantly greater in more severe asthma exacerbations. Heterogeneity between trials included in this review precludes a more definitive conclusion.

Methods

Protocol registration and reporting

The protocol was prospectively registered with PROSPERO (CRD42022373692, available at). The review was done as per the methodology described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and is being reported as per the updated Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines.

Research question

Does inhaled/nebulised MgSO 4 as an adjunct to SABA, compared with standard therapy, help reduce asthma severity score in children presenting with acute asthma exacerbation?

Information sources and eligibility criteria

We searched Medline (via PubMed), Embase, Web of Science and CENTRAL for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published from inception until 15 December 2023. The search was further updated on 15 February 2024. We did not use any language restrictions or filters during the database search. The electronic search was supplemented by a manual search of the bibliography of relevant reports to identify additional citations. We also searched various registries (until 15 December 2023), namely ClinicalTrials.gov, Clinical Trial Registry of India, Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry and the European Union Clinical Trials Register. We included studies if they meet all the following criteria: (1) population: children aged 1–18 years with acute asthma, (2) intervention: inhaled/nebulised MgSO 4, (3) control: either placebo with standard therapy or standard therapy alone, (4) study design: parallel-group RCTs. Studies will be excluded if they meet any of the following criteria: (1) population: adults, (2) intervention: oral or intravenous MgSO 4, (3) study design: non-RCT/crossover RCT, and studies published in non-English language or as abstract only.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was the asthma severity. There are multiple scores for assessing asthma severity, namely the Pulmonary Index Score, Pediatric Asthma Severity Score, Childhood Asthma Scoreand the Pediatric Respiratory Assessment Measure. All these scores are on an ordinal scale where increasing scores mean increasing disease severity. We combined studies reporting similar scores. If different scores were reported across studies, then we combined them using standardised mean difference (SMD) calculated by the following formula:

Secondary outcomes included pulmonary function tests (forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1), peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR)), need for hospitalisation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, length of hospital stay, effect on physiological parameters (heart rate, respiratory rate and oxygen saturation) and adverse events, including mortality before discharge.

Methods

Search strategy

A medical librarian (MVN) performed a comprehensive literature search on April 2016. Searched databases were as follows: Medline, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Embase, and on-going clinical trials. The main search concepts were asthma and oral magnesium; Boolean operators: OR (for combining synonyms), AND (to combine concepts), and truncations were used when appropriate. A review of references and a manual search of relevant articles was completed. Additionally, we contacted the authors of the trials to minimize chances of missed articles. The search was updated on May 2017. No restrictions to study type, time, or language were applied.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

We included RCTs that investigated the use of oral magnesium as an adjunct to asthma inhalers. Asthma was defined in accordance with the authors of the included trials, which were either clinically, objectively (spirometry), or both. All trials fulfilled the inclusion criteria as follows: (1) Population: mild and moderate asthmatic older than 6 years [6 years was the cut-off based on the global initiative for asthma (GINA) guidelines];(2) Intervention: all preparations of oral magnesium, regardless of name or dosage; (3) Comparisons: placebo or no treatment; (4) Outcomes: frequency of rescue asthma exacerbation, ER visits or hospital admissions, objective measures: FEV1, FVC, and PEF, daytime symptoms, daytime activity, night-time symptoms, frequency of bronchodilator use, use of oral or inhaled steroids, side effects, and mortality; (5) Timing: treatment for any duration was included; (6) Study type: RCTs, blinded or open-labeled. Crossover trials were excluded.

Study selection

Two reviewers (AA and FA) separately scanned the titles and abstracts of all articles, and when needed, the full text was retrieved and reviewed to identify all relevant articles. A third author (MF) resolved any disagreements.

Data extraction

Important data were extracted using a piloted form, which incorporated all attributes of the studies, including author, publication year, country, setting, design, sample size, intervention (dose and type), placebo, patient's age and sex, severity, study duration, inclusion and exclusion criteria, outcomes, and limitations. Data was extracted by AA and FA and reviewed by MF. We contacted the author of the study in question for any missing information.

### Role of nebulised magnesium sulfate in treating acute asthma in children: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115Dds8g]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2024). High credibility.

Strengths and limitations

This systematic review and meta-analysis was performed using standard Cochrane methodology and is reported as per appropriate guidelines. All studies used a placebo and were double-blind, adding to their robustness. Most studies enrolled children with similar disease severity (moderate to severe exacerbation) from similar settings (emergency room), reducing the clinical heterogeneity and making the results more robust and widely applicable. However, there are certain limitations. Most of the studies had small sample sizes, hence, had wide CIs, reducing the level of certainty. The asthma severity scores used in different studies varied greatly. Though we used an appropriate approach to summarise them, it still affects our certainty in results. Unfortunately, there is a shortage of data for subgroup analyses based on disease severity or age group. Though adverse events were rare, they were not reported consistently.

Due to these limitations, the certainty of the evidence for most outcomes was low or very low. This certainty can be improved by adding larger, adequately powered, placebo-controlled multicentric RCTs. Until larger trials are available, the current evidence does not support the routine use of nebulised MgSO 4 as an add-on therapy in children presenting with acute exacerbation of asthma not responding to inhaled SABAs and systemic steroids.

### Role of nebulised magnesium sulfate in treating acute asthma in children: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1149UHwk]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2024). High credibility.

Objectives

To review the efficacy of nebulised magnesium sulfate (MgSO 4) in acute asthma in children.

Methods

The authors searched Medline, Embase, Web of Science and Cochrane Library for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published until 15 December 2023. RCTs were included if they compared the efficacy and safety of nebulised MgSO 4 as a second-line agent in children presenting with acute asthma exacerbation. A random-effects meta-analysis was performed, and the Risk of Bias V.2 tool was used to assess the biases among them.

Results

10 RCTs enrolling 2301 children with acute asthma were included. All trials were placebo controlled and administered nebulised MgSO 4 /placebo and salbutamol (± ipratropium bromide). There was no significant difference in Composite Asthma Severity Score between the two groups (6 RCTs, 1953 participants; standardised mean difference: −0.09; 95% CI: −0.2 to +0.02, I² = 21%). Children in the MgSO 4 group have significantly better peak expiratory flow rate (% predicted) than the control group (2 RCTs, 145 participants; mean difference: 19.3; 95% CI: 8.9 to 29.8; I² = 0%). There was no difference in the need for hospitalisation, intensive care unit admission or duration of hospital stay. Adverse events were minor, infrequent (7.3%) and similar among the two groups.

Conclusions

There is low-certainty evidence that nebulised MgSO 4 as an add-on second-line therapy for acute asthma in children does not reduce asthma severity or a need for hospitalisation. However, it was associated with slightly better lung functions. The current evidence does not support the routine use of nebulised MgSO 4 in paediatric acute asthma management.

### The role of oral magnesium supplements for the management of stable bronchial asthma: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1128J2GY]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease that affects ~300 million people worldwide, reaching up to 18% of the population in certain countries.

Symptoms of asthma include coughing, wheezing, chest tightness, and other respiratory complaints. Most of the time these symptoms are mild and can be controlled with inhalers and avoidance of known allergens, but other times they can lead to exacerbations that can be life threatening. An estimated annual 300,000 deaths worldwide are attributed to asthma.

The mainstay of management is a beta-agonist and corticosteroids inhaler. However, new investigations into the pathogenesis of the disease are emerging. For example, many reports have observed that low blood levels and low dietary intake of magnesium are factors that possibly contribute to the development of asthma. – In addition, low levels of magnesium have been detected in asthmatics compared with non-asthmatics, especially those that have presented to the emergency department with exacerbations. –

Magnesium deficiency has a role in many diseases in addition to asthma, including migraines, depression, and epilepsy.– Although the exact role magnesium has in asthma is not completely understood, it is known that it functions as an anti-inflammatory agent in addition to its role in inhibiting the effect of calcium to contract smooth muscle.–

Previous trials showed that magnesium use through intravenous or inhaled routes does have a role in managing asthma in acute exacerbations. – However, studies published on the benefits of oral supplements have reported unclear conclusions.– Major problems with these trials regarding randomization, placebo use, intervention duration, outcome measurements, and baseline level of serum magnesium may explain the conflicting results.

The role of intravenous and inhaled magnesium in the management of acute asthma has been extensively studied and the guidelines are well established. IV or inhaled routes can be used as a last resort for severe, persistent asthma that fails to respond to conventional treatment. Nevertheless, oral magnesium is not included in these guidelines.

Our aim in this study was to conduct a meta-analysis of all published reports on the effect of oral magnesium for the management of chronic asthma.

### Role of nebulised magnesium sulfate in treating acute asthma in children: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115fLgp7]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Asthma is the most common chronic disease of childhood, affecting nearly 22 million children worldwide. Acute exacerbation is the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in children with asthma and accounts for almost 13 000 deaths and 5 million disability-adjusted life years, along with a huge healthcare cost. The first-line therapy for acute exacerbation of childhood asthma is well established and comprises systemic corticosteroids and inhaled short-acting β 2 -agonists (SABAs) along with controlled oxygen. However, many children do not respond to these agents and hence necessitate additional therapy (second line). The role of intravenous and nebulised magnesium sulfate (MgSO 4) has been explored as second-line therapy for acute exacerbation; however, the controversy on its route and timing still exists.

The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) 2021 update suggests using intravenous MgSO 4 (not nebulised) for patients with severe exacerbation not responding to initial treatment; however, the 2023 update suggests nebulised isotonic MgSO 4 as a second-line therapy for children aged 2 years and above. In a recent systematic review, intravenous MgSO 4 as a second-line therapy was associated with reduced hospitalisation and improved lung functions. Previous systematic reviews on nebulised MgSO 4 showed variable and contradictory results, adding further uncertainty. Recently, the role of nebulised MgSO 4 as second-line therapy in asthma exacerbation has been further explored in many more trials, necessitating an update on this aspect.

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aimed to update the evidence on the efficacy and safety of inhaled/nebulised MgSO 4 as second-line therapy in children and adolescents (up to 18 years) with acute asthma exacerbation.

### Intravenous magnesium sulfate for treating children with acute asthma in the emergency department [^114nqCHR]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Acute asthma in children can be life-threatening and must be treated promptly in the emergency setting. Intravenous magnesium sulfate is recommended by various guidelines for cases of acute asthma that have not responded to first-line treatment with bronchodilators and steroids. The treatment has recently been shown to reduce the need for hospital admission for adults compared with placebo, but it is unclear whether it is equally effective for children.

Objectives

To assess the safety and efficacy of intravenous magnesium sulfate (IV MgSO4) in children treated for acute asthma in the emergency department (ED).

Search Methods

We identified studies by searching the Cochrane Airways Review Group Specialised Register up to 23 February 2016. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and reference lists of other reviews, and we contacted study authors to ask for additional information.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials of children treated in the ED for exacerbations of asthma if they compared any dose of IV MgSO4 with placebo.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors screened the results of the search and independently extracted data from studies meeting the inclusion criteria. We resolved disagreements through discussion and contacted study authors in cases of missing data and other uncertainties relating to the studies. We analysed dichotomous data as odds ratios and continuous data as mean differences, both using fixed-effect models. We assessed each study for risk of bias and rated the quality of evidence for each outcome with GRADE and presented the results in a 'Summary of findings' table. There was insufficient evidence to conduct the planned subgroup analyses.

Main Results

Five studies (182 children) met the inclusion criteria, and four contributed data to at least one meta-analysis. The included studies were overall at low risk of bias, but our confidence in the evidence was generally low, mainly due to the small sample sizes. Treatment with IV MgSO4 reduced the odds of admission to hospital by 68% (odds ratio (OR) 0.32, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.14 to 0.74; children = 115; studies = 3; I(2) = 63%). This result was based on data from just three studies including 115 children. Meta-analysis for the secondary outcomes was extremely limited by paucity of data. We performed meta-analysis for the outcome 'return to the emergency department within 48 hours', which showed a very imprecise effect estimate that was not statistically significant (OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.02 to 10.30; children = 85; studies = 2; I(2) = 0%). Side effects and adverse events were not consistently reported and meta-analysis was not possible, however few side effects or adverse events were reported.

Authors' Conclusions

IV MgSO4 may reduce the need for hospital admission in children presenting to the ED with moderate to severe exacerbations of asthma, but the evidence is extremely limited by the number and size of studies. Few side effects of the treatment were reported, but the data were extremely limited.

### Question 5: magnesium sulphate for acute asthma in children [^114w8Sn5]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Most children who present to the emergency department with acute asthma, respond well to inhaled β 2 -agonists (spacer or nebuliser), oxygen (if required) and systemic steroids. Guidelines across the world agree on this simple, straight forward evidenced based approach. In children with more severe asthma attacks and those who do not respond to initial treatment, the evidence base for the secondary level treatment is less clear. Many regimens exist for the next step. Intravenous Magnesium Sulphate (MgSO 4) is now used frequently in these situations and some centres are starting to use nebulized MgSO 4 as part of the initial maximal inhaled therapy options. This paper examines the role of MgSO 4 in acute asthma in children. It focusses on how MgSO 4 might work, what are the current recommendations for use and then what is the current evidence base to support its use. We have presented the evidence for the use of both nebulized and intravenous MgSO 4. At the end of the paper we have suggested future directions for research in this area. Our aim is to present a synthesis of the current role of MgSO 4 in the management of an acute asthma attack.

Archives of Disease in Childhood (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The role of intravenous magnesium sulfate in asthma exacerbation is unclear.

Aims

To determine the efficacy and safety of intravenous magnesium sulfate in managing asthma exacerbation in children.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and the Web of Science up to May 2024. We included randomised controlled trials and followed the international guidelines for conducting systematic reviews. Outcomes included morbidity, escalation of care, length of hospital stay, lung functions, adverse events, and mortality.

Results

Nine studies (total participants = 473) were included. Hospitalisation rate and the need for non-invasive ventilation were less among the intravenous magnesium sulfate group (mean difference (MD) = 0.70, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.90, I 2 7%, n = 115) and (risk ratio (RR) = 0.17, 95%CI 0.15 to 0.54, p = 0.003, n = 143), respectively. Asthma severity scores (MD = -0.18, 95%CI -1.35 to 0.98, I 2 2%, n = 115), length of hospital stay (MD = -78.86, 95%CI -200.37 to 42.66, I 2 99%, n = 284) and the need for invasive ventilation (RR = 0.35, 95% CI 0.11 to 1.17, I 2 0%, n = 237) were similar. There was no difference in the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) admission rate (p = 0.43 n = 61). Peak expiratory flow improved in the intravenous magnesium group (p < 0.001, n = 20). No serious adverse events were reported.

Conclusion

We found low-certainty evidence that intravenous magnesium sulfate results in a lower hospitalisation rate and less need for non-invasive ventilation. Asthma scores, PICU admission, invasive ventilation and length of hospital stay were similar. While the evidence base is weak, the favourable safety profile suggests that intravenous magnesium sulfate can be considered a treatment for asthma exacerbations.

### The patient with asthma in the emergency department [^112h47vp]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2012). Low credibility.

Asthma is a highly prevalent disease that presents commonly to the emergency department (ED) in acute exacerbation. Recent asthma treatment guidelines have added content dedicated to the management of acute exacerbations. Effective management of an exacerbation requires rapid assessment of severity through physical examination, measurement of peak expiratory flow rate, and response to initial treatment. Most therapies are directed at alleviating bronchospasm and decreasing airway inflammation. While inhaled short-acting beta-agonists, systemic corticosteroids, and supplemental oxygen are the initial and often only therapies required for patients with mild moderate exacerbations, high-dose beta agonists and inhaled anti-cholinergics should also be given to patients with severe exacerbations. Adjunctive therapy with intravenous magnesium and Heliox-driven nebulization of bronchodilators should be considered for patients presenting with severe and very severe exacerbations. Early recognition and appropriate management of respiratory failure are required to mitigate the risk of complications including death. Disposition should be determined based on serial assessments of the response to therapy over the first 4 h in the ED. Patients stable for discharge should receive medications, asthma education including a written asthma action plan, and should have follow-up scheduled for them by ED staff. Rapid implementation of evidence-based, multi-disciplinary care is required to ensure the best possible outcomes for this potentially treatable disease.

### Role of nebulised magnesium sulfate in treating acute asthma in children: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116LtwpW]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2024). High credibility.

Conclusions

Treatment with nebulised MgSO 4 as an adjunct to SABA (± ipratropium) compared with standard therapy does not lead to better control of asthma exacerbation or reduce the need for hospitalisation among the children presenting with acute asthma exacerbation. It significantly improves pulmonary functions (PEFR) and is not associated with increased adverse events. However, our confidence in the evidence is low, and substantial uncertainty remains. There is a need for large RCTs on this aspect to improve the certainty of the evidence.

### Intravenous magnesium sulfate for asthma exacerbations in children: systematic review with meta-analysis [^111TjGJc]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Asthma is the most prevalent chronic disease in children and constitutes a significant healthcare burden. First-line therapy for acute asthma exacerbations is well established. However, secondary treatments, including intravenous magnesium sulfate (IV-MgSO4), remain variable due to scarcity of data on its efficacy and safety.

Objective

To assess the effectiveness and safety of IV-MgSO4 as a second line of treatment in managing children with asthma exacerbations.

Methods

We searched five databases from inception until April 2023 on randomized clinical trials of IV-MgSO4 in children with acute asthma exacerbations. The primary outcomes were hospitalization rate and length, and change in the severity score. Secondary outcomes included percentage increase in peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), hospital re-admission rate, need and length for pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) treatment, and adverse effects. Meta-analysis was performed for three outcomes with estimated odds ratios (ORs) or mean differences (MDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

Results

Eleven studies met the final criteria. In comparison to control, administration of IV-MgSO4 was associated with a reduced hospitalization risk (OR 0.15; 95%CI: 0.03, 0.73) in four studies, and improvement of lung function (MD 26.77% PEFR; 95%CI: 18.41, 54.79) in two studies. There were no significant differences in the length of stay between groups. Due to heterogeneity, a narrative synthesis of other outcomes was performed.

Conclusion

The use of IV-MgSO4 demonstrated a reduction in the hospitalization rate and PEFR improvement in children with asthma exacerbations. Adverse effects were rare. Further well-designed studies are needed to better determine the efficacy and safety profile of IV-MgSO4.

### Intravenous magnesium for acute asthma? [^115Sq83k]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2003). Low credibility.

Each year in the UK, around 1,500 people die from asthma. Standard treatment has been based on bronchodilators (e.g. beta 2-stimulants) and anti-inflammatory drugs (corticosteroids). The recently revised British Guideline on the Management of Asthma suggests also using a single dose of i.v. magnesium sulphate in patients with acute severe asthma, an unlicensed indication. Here we discuss the rationale for giving i.v. magnesium and whether it offers any advantage for patients with acute severe asthma.

### Role of nebulised magnesium sulfate in treating acute asthma in children: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111EaSHu]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2024). High credibility.

Results

We retrieved 499 records (394 from database searching and 105 from registers), of which 237 were duplicates (figure 1). We assessed 197 reports for full text, of which only 10 met all inclusion criteria and were included. A detailed list of excluded studies is provided in online supplemental table 2. The foremost reasons for exclusion were review articles, different interventions (intravenous or oral MgSO 4) or different populations (adults or children with other diseases).

Figure 1
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) flow diagram.

Study characteristics

We include 10 RCTs enrolling 2301 children of 2–17 years age range with acute asthma exacerbation. All trials used nebulised MgSO 4 along with SABA (± ipratropium bromide). All were done in the emergency room setting except one, which was done in the paediatric ICU. There was wide variation in the frequency and cumulative dose of the intervention (online supplemental table 3).

Risk of bias

We used the RoB2 tool for the risk of bias assessment. Three trials were at low risk of bias in all domains, and six trialshave some concerns in the selection of reported results (mostly due to lack of availability of protocol in the public domain and/or inadequate information on analysis reporting). One trial had concerns about the allocation concealment and the selection of reported results. None of the trials were considered at high risk of bias. Detailed graphical light plots and summary plots are shown in figure 2.

Primary outcome

The primary outcome was asthma control, assessed by a Composite Asthma Severity Score and reported in six trials. There was no significant difference in the Composite Asthma Severity Score between the two groups (6 RCTs, 1953 participants; SMD: −0.09; 95% CI: −0.2 to +0.02, I² = 21%) (figure 3A and table 1). Individual trials used different asthma severity scores, so we also compared them. The two groups had no significant difference regarding individual scores (figure 3B).

### The role of oral magnesium supplements for the management of stable bronchial asthma: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114vx9ST]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the effects of oral magnesium on chronic asthma. The results of the measured outcomes was overall precise and nonsignificant (except for FEV1 at week 8). None of the trials reported on mortality or adverse events. Certainty in these estimates is low. There was some high heterogeneity, which could be explained by different type, dose, or duration of the intervention across the experimental groups in the involved RCTs. We excluded crossover RCTs due to uncertainty over washout periods of magnesium. We have identified ongoing trials registered in Clinicaltrials.gov, which might have future implications on the conclusion reached in this study.

The role of magnesium in bronchial asthma has been discussed in the recent GINA guidelines. The evidence supports the use of intravenous magnesium in acute situations, especially with asthmatics that do not respond to initial management. However, the routine use of intravenous magnesium in acute or chronic asthma is not supported by evidence. Nevertheless, the use of oral magnesium for the prevention of asthma exacerbations or to improve control has not been discussed in the GINA report. Other supplements, such as vitamin D, were mentioned in GINA. In the present study, only FEV1 was shown to be significantly improved with oral magnesium.

However, encouraging findings were found especially in Kazak's study including a significant increase in the concentration of methacholine required to cause a 20% drop in FEV1 at 6 months, and a 5.8% improvement in PEFR and an improvement in subjective measures (AQLQ, ACQ) all noticed at 6.5 months in subjects who were in the treatment group. Therefore, there is a need for future large, high quality RCTs to reliably determine the role of oral magnesium in asthma management. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review and meta-analyses evaluating the use of magnesium supplements as an adjunct treatment to inhalers for asthmatics.

There are several limitations to this study. First, sample sizes are considered relatively small for a common disease like asthma, some trials recruited less than fifty participants. Second, important data were missing in some of the trials; strategies we used to overcome this problem were discussed in the methodology above. Additionally, we were not able to assess the effect of the intervention on reducing the dose of inhaled steroid, because it was only reported in a single study which showed no benefit.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^111AiAMp]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Magnesium — intravenous magnesium sulfate is not recommended for routine use in asthma exacerbations; however, when given as a single 2 g infusion over 20 minutes, it reduces hospital admissions in some patients, including adults with FEV1 < 25–30% predicted at presentation and children whose FEV1 fails to reach 60% predicted after 1 hour of care, and in adults and children who fail to respond to initial treatment and have persistent hypoxemia; trials excluding more severe asthma showed no benefit from adding intravenous or nebulized magnesium compared with placebo in routine care for adults and adolescents.

### Management of acute asthma exacerbations [^113juTH7]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Asthma exacerbations can be classified as mild, moderate, severe, or life threatening. Criteria for exacerbation severity are based on symptoms and physical examination parameters, as well as lung function and oxygen saturation. In patients with a peak expiratory flow of 50 to 79 percent of their personal best, up to two treatments of two to six inhalations of short-acting beta2 agonists 20 minutes apart followed by a reassessment of peak expiratory flow and symptoms may be safely employed at home. Administration using a hand-held metered-dose inhaler with a spacer device is at least equivalent to nebulized beta2 agonist therapy in children and adults. In the ambulatory and emergency department settings, the goals of treatment are correction of severe hypoxemia, rapid reversal of airflow obstruction, and reduction of the risk of relapse. Multiple doses of inhaled anticholinergic medication combined with beta2 agonists improve lung function and decrease hospitalization in school-age children with severe asthma exacerbations. Intravenous magnesium sulfate has been shown to significantly increase lung function and decrease the necessity of hospitalization in children. The administration of systemic corticosteroids within one hour of emergency department presentation decreases the need for hospitalization, with the most pronounced effect in patients with severe exacerbations. Airway inflammation can persist for days to weeks after an acute attack; therefore, more intensive treatment should be continued after discharge until symptoms and peak expiratory flow return to baseline.

### Pharmacologic treatment of the adult hospitalized asthma patient [^112jEgf9]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2001). Low credibility.

Acute severe asthma calls for aggressive and early therapy of a multifaceted and all-inclusive approach (Fig. 2). Therapy merely begins in the ED and manifold distinct issues need to find consideration during ongoing hospital care. Currently, beta-agonists, anti-cholinergic agents, and corticosteroids remain the mainstay of therapy. Methylxanthines and magnesium may find consideration in carefully selected patients. Multiple new therapeutic avenues, such as the anti-leukotriene drugs, seem promising and future studies will hopefully extend our armamentarium against life threatening complication of a common disease. Asthma education begun in the hospital may provide the platform for preventing severe acute exacerbations and hospitalization.

### Asthma in adults (acute) [^115ydVhU]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2011). Medium credibility.

Introduction

About 10% of adults have suffered an attack of asthma, and up to 5% of these have severe disease that responds poorly to treatment. Patients with severe disease have an increased risk of death, but patients with mild to moderate disease are also at risk of exacerbations. Most guidelines about the management of asthma follow stepwise protocols. This review does not endorse or follow any particular protocol, but presents the evidence about specific interventions.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments for acute asthma? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to April 2010 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 100 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: beta(2) agonists (plus ipratropium bromide, pressured metered-dose inhalers, short-acting continuous nebulised, short-acting intermittent nebulised, short-acting iv, and inhaled formoterol); corticosteroids (inhaled); corticosteroids (single oral, combined inhaled, and short courses); education about acute asthma; generalist care; helium-oxygen mixture (heliox); magnesium sulphate (iv and adding isotonic nebulised magnesium to inhaled beta(2) agonists); mechanical ventilation; oxygen supplementation (controlled 28% oxygen and controlled 100% oxygen); and specialist care.

### Asthma in adults [^114WFcbt]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2007). Medium credibility.

Introduction

About 10% of adults have suffered an attack of asthma, and up to 5% of these have severe disease that responds poorly to treatment. Patients with severe disease have an increased risk of death, but patients with mild to moderate disease are also at risk of exacerbations. Most guidelines about the management of asthma follow stepwise protocols. This review does not endorse or follow any particular protocol, but presents the evidence about specific interventions.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments for chronic, and for acute asthma? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to October 2006 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 121 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: for acute asthma: beta(2) agonists (plus Ipratropium bromide, nebulisers, pressured metered-dose inhalers, short-acting continuous nebulised, short-acting intermittent nebulised, short-acting intravenous), corticosteroids (inhaled), corticosteroids (single oral, combined inhaled, short courses), education about acute asthma, generalist care, helium-oxygen mixture, magnesium sulphate (intravenous, adding isotonic nebulised magnesium to inhaled beta(2) agonists), mechanical ventilation, oxygen supplementation (controlled 28% oxygen, controlled 100% oxygen), specialist care. For chronic asthma: beta(2) agonists (adding long-acting inhaled when poorly controlled by inhaled corticosteroids, or short-acting inhaled as needed for symptom relief), inhaled corticosteroids (low dose, increasing dose), leukotriene antagonists (with or without inhaled corticosteroids), theophylline (when poorly controlled by inhaled corticosteroids).

### Intravenous magnesium sulfate for acute asthma… [^113KaN55]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

All participants presented to the emergency department with an asthma exacerbation, although definitions and inclusion criteria varied. In eight of the studies, patients received a single 2-g infusion of intravenous magnesium sulfate; in the remaining three studies, patients received a 1. 2-g infusion. All participants were rated for degree of exacerbation severity, which was then verified using British Thoracic Society/Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network criteria. 2 All of the studies included exacerbations of at least moderate severity. The Cochrane review revealed a significant reduction in hospital admissions in all adults, regardless of asthma severity, who received intravenous magnesium sulfate compared with those who received placebo.

In adults, the greatest benefit of intravenous magnesium sulfate occurred in patients with life-threatening asthma exacerbations. The severity of the exacerbation was based on the patient's initial presentation and was determined retrospectively from data extracted from the various studies included in the meta-analysis. The BTS/SIGN guidelines have been updated, using the previous categories plus the addition of a new level of severity labeled "near-fatal asthma exacerbation" for patients who require mechanical ventilation. Although it appears that patients who presented in life-threatening distress benefited the most from intravenous magnesium sulfate, other factors, such as more attention from hospital staff or shorter time to receive treatment, may have played a role in the better outcomes in this subgroup.

The studies differed in the timing, dosage, and frequency of magnesium sulfate administration; types of other medications given; and the order in which medications were administered. This made it difficult to determine the exact degree of effect attributable to treatment with magnesium sulfate. Conclusion: Our NNT color recommendation is green. Most of the benefit from this intervention appeared to be in children and in sicker adults who initially presented with life-threatening asthma exacerbations. However, further randomized controlled trials of children are required to achieve the larger sample size needed to provide more definitive evidence for the effectiveness of magnesium sulfate in this population. In adults, further studies using more uniform treatment protocols will be required to minimize confounding factors and to confirm the apparent benefit of magnesium sulfate in this population.

We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 99 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions.

### Management of acute, severe asthma in children [^111xg7yE]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To briefly present the current options available for the treatment of acute, severe asthma in children, with a special focus on emergency department and inpatient treatment, and to describe newer therapies that may aid treatment in the future.

Data Sources and Study Selection

A MEDLINE search (1966-May 2001) of the English-language literature pertaining to drug therapy of acute asthma was performed. Key word searches included acute asthma, albuterol, ipratropium, corticosteroids, magnesium, and theophylline. Additional articles from these sources and published national guidelines were identified. Relevant studies pertaining to current therapy of acute asthma in pediatric patients were selected; if there were minimal pediatric data, adult data were included.

Data Synthesis

Asthma is a chronic, inflammatory disorder of the airways. Acute exacerbations can occur and are challenging to manage. Albuterol, ipratropium, and systemic corticosteroids have been shown to be effective in acute asthma exacerbations. Because some patients do not respond to maximal therapy, older therapies such as magnesium and theophylline are being reevaluated. Theophylline may have some therapeutic effect, but given its toxicity profile, it is unclear whether it offers any advantage over maximal beta(2)-agonist therapy. There are only minimal published data evaluating the use of magnesium in pediatrics, and most are small trials or case reports. Newer therapies such as ventilation strategies with heliox and intravenous leukotriene modifiers currently being evaluated may or may not prove to be beneficial in the future.

Conclusions

beta(2)-agonists, ipratropium, and corticosteroids remain the most useful therapeutic agents for acute asthma exacerbations in pediatric patients. However, these agents are not ideal in all patients and, given the existing questions regarding safety and/or efficacy of available alternatives, more effective options are needed.

### The acute management of asthma [^1158sEkS]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

Patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) or clinic with acute exacerbation of asthma (AEA) can be very challenging varying in both severity and response to therapy. High-dose, frequent or continuous nebulized short-acting beta2 agonist (SABA) therapy that can be combined with a short-acting muscarinic antagonist (SAMA) is the backbone of treatment. When patients do not rapidly clinically respond to SABA/SAMA inhalation, the early use of oral or parenteral corticosteroids should be considered and has been shown to impact the immediate need for ICU admission or even the need for hospital admission. Adjunctive therapies such as the use of intravenous magnesium and helium/oxygen combination gas for inhalation and for driving a nebulizer to deliver a SABA and or SAMA should be considered and are best used early in the treatment plan if they are likely to impact the patients' clinical course. The use of other agents such as theophylline, leukotriene modifiers, inhaled corticosteroids, long-acting beta2 agonist, and long-acting muscarinic antagonist currently does not play a major role in the immediate treatment of AEA in the clinic or the ED but is an important therapeutic option for physicians to be aware of and to consider initiating at the time of discharge from clinic, hospital, or ED to reduce later clinical worsening and readmission to the ED and hospital. A comprehensive summary is provided of the currently available respiratory pharmaceuticals approved for asthma and other airway syndromes. Clinicians must be prepared to use the entire spectrum of medications available for the treatment of acute asthma exacerbations and the agents that should be initiated to prevent worsening or additional exacerbations. They need to be familiar with the major potential drug toxicities associated with their use.

### Asthma diagnosis and management [^114Rsq7P]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Asthma is a chronic inflammatory airway disease that is commonly seen in the emergency department (ED). This article provides an evidence-based review of diagnosis and management of asthma. Early recognition of asthma exacerbations and initiation of treatment are essential. Treatment is dictated by the severity of the exacerbation. Treatment involves bronchodilators and corticosteroids. Other treatment modalities including magnesium, heliox, and noninvasive ventilator support are discussed. Safe disposition from the ED can be considered after stabilization of the exacerbation, response to treatment and attaining peak flow measures.

### Role of nebulised magnesium sulfate in treating acute asthma in children: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114JqQ26]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

This systematic review and meta-analysis assessed the efficacy and safety of adjuvant nebulised/inhaled MgSO 4 as a second-line therapy for acute exacerbation in childhood asthma. Overall, 10 RCTs enrolling 2301 children with asthma were included. Low-certainty evidence suggests that add-on therapy with inhaled MgSO 4 in acute exacerbation of childhood asthma does not decrease the severity of asthma exacerbation and hence does not improve the immediate asthma exacerbation control. It does not reduce the need for hospitalisation, ICU admission or length of hospital stay (low to very low certainty). However, it does benefit the pulmonary functions in terms of improved PEFR (low-certainty evidence). There is very low-certainty evidence that adjuvant inhaled MgSO 4 does not increase adverse events like hypotension, bradycardia or respiratory depression.

MgSO 4 has many mechanisms through which it was thought to have possible beneficial effects on asthma. MgSO 4 inhibits calcium ion influx, acetylcholine and histamine release from cholinergic motor nerve terminals and mast cells. Simultaneously, it promoted the synthesis of nitric oxide and prostacyclin. These actions lead to bronchodilation, an essential aspect of asthma management. Also, it may augment the responsiveness of β-receptors to salbutamol and hence can play a complementary role. Furthermore, it stabilises T cells, neutrophils and mast cells, and has anti-inflammatory properties. By virtue of these potential actions, its use has increased significantly in asthma management despite the absence of strong evidence favouring it.

Intravenous and nebulised preparations have been extensively used in various clinical trials in children and adults. There are conflicting reports on the efficacy of intravenous MgSO 4 in adults and paediatric asthma. A recent systematic review in adults with asthma found no significant effect of intravenous MgSO 4 on critical clinical outcomes. In contrast, a review in children suggests that it may reduce the need for hospitalisation and improve lung functions. However, the later evidence is based on extremely limited data and is subject to extreme uncertainty.

### Magnesium sulphate in the treatment of acute asthma: evaluation of current practice in adult emergency departments [^112xS2BT]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Background

A recent meta-analysis showed that intravenous and nebulised magnesium sulphate have similar levels of evidence to support their use in the treatment of acute asthma in adults. This consisted of weak evidence of effect on respiratory function and hospital admissions, with wide confidence intervals ranging from no effect to significant positive effects. Current BTS/SIGN guidelines suggest an equivocal role for intravenous magnesium sulphate and no role for nebulised magnesium sulphate. A study was performed to assess what emergency physicians currently do in their management of acute asthma.

Method

A postal survey was undertaken of all adult emergency departments within the UK. A structured questionnaire was sent to all clinical leads in emergency medicine about their current usage of both intravenous and nebulised magnesium sulphate in the treatment of acute asthma.

Results

180 of the 251 emergency departments in the UK responded (72%). Magnesium sulphate was used in 93%, mostly because it was expected to relieve breathlessness (70%) or reduce HDU/ITU admissions (51%). It was predominantly given to those patients with acute severe asthma (84%) and life-threatening exacerbations (87%), with most stating they would give the drug if there was no response to repeated nebulisers (68%). In comparison, nebulised magnesium sulphate was only used in two emergency departments (1%). The main reason for not administering the drug via a nebuliser was insufficient evidence (51%).

Conclusions

Intravenous magnesium sulphate is widely used for acute asthma, usually for patients with severe or life-threatening asthma who have not responded to initial treatment. Nebulised magnesium sulphate, by contrast, is hardly used at all. The use of intravenous magnesium sulphate is more extensive than current guidelines or available evidence would appear to support.

### Optimizing the use of intravenous magnesium sulfate for acute asthma treatment in children [^111yAzKU]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma is the most common pediatric chronic disease and currently affects 7.1 million children in the United States. Many children experience acute asthma exacerbations. Many children also require hospitalization despite treatment in an emergency department with current standard therapy (corticosteroids, albuterol, and ipratropium). These hospitalizations may be avoided if effective adjunctive therapies can be developed to adequately treat severe exacerbations.

Methods

Publications were searched in the PubMed database using the following keywords: magnesium AND asthma AND children AND randomized controlled trial. A total of 30 publications were returned. References of relevant articles were also screened. We included publications of controlled randomized trials where intravenous magnesium sulfate was studied in children (age < 18 years) with acute asthma (n = 7). We excluded studies in adults or trials with other formulations of magnesium (e.g., nebulized).

Results

Previous studies have demonstrated that intravenous magnesium sulfate (IV MgSO 4) significantly improves respiratory function and reduces hospitalization rate in children with moderate to severe asthma exacerbations. Current dosing regimens involve a short infusion of 25-75mg/kg over 20min (maximum 2–2.5g/dose), though no studies have directly compared dosages for relative efficacy. Several studies suggest utilizing a peak plasma concentration of magnesium higher than 4mg/dL as a surrogate of efficacy. This review summarizes the literature regarding the use of IV MgSO 4 for the treatment of pediatric acute asthma.

Conclusions

We suggest that optimized dosing regimens could be developed using a linked pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling and simulation approach. We propose the factors that should be considered in future clinical trial design in order to better understand the use of IV MgSO 4 in pediatric acute asthma.

### Survey of physicians' attitudes toward the use of magnesium sulfate for acute asthma exacerbations in Turkey [^111g4UUQ]. The Journal of Asthma (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) is considered to be a well-tolerated, inexpensive, and effective medication for severe asthma exacerbations. We surveyed physicians who treat patients with asthma to evaluate the current knowledge and usage of MgSO4.

Methods

A self-administered questionnaire was e-mailed to members of the Turkish National Society of Allergy and Clinical Immunology and was distributed to participants of its annual congress.

Results

Of the 456 respondents (mean age: 36.53 ± 9.11 years), 42.3% reported to use MgSO4 in asthma exacerbations in their practice, and 48.7% agreed that MgSO4 was included in asthma guidelines. The best known indication was that it was useful only in patients refractory to bronchodilators and systemic corticosteroids (67.7%). The two most common reasons to use MgSO4 were to shorten hospital stay (94.7%), and prevent admission to intensive care unit (80.3%). The respondents mostly used MgSO4 in the treatment of severe or life-threatening exacerbations. Thirty-nine percent believed that MgSO4 had no effect on discharge period, and 29% of them marked minor side effects. The most common reason for not using MgSO4 was inexperience (36.5%). Having an academic affiliation (OR = 3.20, p < 0.001), the number of asthmatic outpatients seen per month (OR = 1.82, p = 0.007), and more recent graduation from medical school (≤ 1991) (OR = 0.23, p < 0.001) were associated with the use of MgSO4 in the multivariate analysis.

Conclusion

Even though the effect of MgSO4 in acute severe asthma is well known, only half of the physicians dealing with asthma patients have used it in their practice. Education and encouragement in this regard are necessary.

### The role of oral magnesium supplements for the management of stable bronchial asthma: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111cn2Tu]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Furthermore, GINA guidelines defined adults as those 6 years old and above. This dichotomy is not used in many of the available studies. Clearer details regarding trial methodology, particularly about sequence generation and allocation concealment would help future systematic reviewers appraise the literature more properly. Additionally, clear stratification by oral magnesium dose and duration of therapy can help produce more precise and useful estimates. Finally, none of the RCTs provided their research protocol.

The use of magnesium supplements as an adjuvant to standard asthma treatment in mild to moderate asthmatic patients is not supported by high quality evidence. Apart from one point at week 8 where the FEV1 had significantly improved, no other benefits from oral magnesium supplements were seen. Until future higher quality evidence emerges, oral magnesium cannot be recommended for mild to moderate asthma.

### Intravenous magnesium sulphate provides no additive benefit to standard management in acute asthma [^112BHEKB]. Respiratory Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Treatment of acute asthma is based on rapid reversal of bronchospasm and airway inflammation. Magnesium sulphate (MgSO(4)) is known to have a bronchodilator effect on smooth muscle but studies have shown conflicting results on its efficacy in acute asthma, although its use is recommended in national and international guidelines.

Aims

To determine if intravenous MgSO(4), when used as an adjunct to standard therapy, improves the outcome in acute asthma.

Methods

A double blind, randomised placebo controlled trial comparing 1.2g MgSO(4) with standard therapy in adult patients with acute asthma. Patients had a PEF ≤ 75% predicted and all were treated with oxygen, nebulised salbutamol and ipratropium, and IV hydrocortisone. They then received 1.2g IV MgSO(4) or placebo. Outcome measures were % predicted PEF at 60 min and hospital admission rates.

Results

One hundred and twenty nine patients were studied. Placebo and active treatment groups were well matched at baseline. MgSO(4) had no benefit with regards hospital admission rates or % predicted PEF at 60 min (p = 0.48) for the whole group, or for subgroups of life-threatening (p = 0.85), severe (p = 0.63) and moderate (p = 0.67) acute asthma.

Conclusion

This study did not show additional benefit from 1.2g IV MgSO(4) when given as an adjunct to standard therapy for acute asthma.

### Association between intravenous magnesium therapy in the emergency department and subsequent hospitalization among pediatric patients with refractory acute asthma: secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^112bPqtY]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Acute asthma exacerbations are a leading cause of pediatric emergency department (ED) visits and related hospitalizations, with associated costs of approximately $4 billion annually in the US. Although systemic corticosteroids, inhaled β 2 agonists, and anticholinergics are recommended for the management of severe exacerbations, some children are resistant to this therapy, in part owing to genetic polymorphisms. For children experiencing ongoing respiratory distress after initial management, intravenous (IV) magnesium therapy represents a potential second-line treatment option.

Almost all international asthma management guidelines recommend consideration of IV magnesium as ancillary therapy in children with severe acute asthma. However, the evidence of IV magnesium benefit is, to our knowledge, limited to disparate results from 3 small randomized clinical trials (RCTs) (a total of 115 patients). A decade ago, IV magnesium was generally not used to prevent asthma-related hospitalizations, and only 12% of children hospitalized for asthma received IV magnesium in the ED. A recent Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network Registry reportfound that only 10% of children treated for asthma in the ED were treated with IV magnesium. A 2017 report from the Pediatric Health Information System Data Collaborativefound that although the use of IV magnesium was increasing, 36% of children hospitalized for asthma received IV magnesium. Neither study found an association between IV magnesium and lower hospitalization rates or lower likelihood of being treated in the intensive care unit.

### Acute asthma exacerbations: management strategies [^115sLYex]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Asthma exacerbations, defined as a deterioration in baseline symptoms or lung function, cause significant morbidity and mortality. Asthma action plans help patients triage and manage symptoms at home. In patients 12 years and older, home management includes an inhaled corticosteroid/formoterol combination for those who are not using an inhaled corticosteroid/long-acting beta2 agonist inhaler for maintenance, or a short-acting beta2 agonist for those using an inhaled corticosteroid/long-acting beta2 agonist inhaler that does not include formoterol. In children four to 11 years of age, an inhaled corticosteroid/formoterol inhaler, up to eight puffs daily, can be used to reduce the risk of exacerbations and need for oral corticosteroids. In the office setting, it is important to assess exacerbation severity and begin a short-acting beta2 agonist and oxygen to maintain oxygen saturations, with repeated doses of the short-acting beta2 agonist every 20 minutes for one hour and oral corticosteroids. Patients with severe exacerbations should be transferred to an acute care facility and treated with oxygen, frequent administration of a short-acting beta2 agonist, and corticosteroids. The addition of a short-acting muscarinic antagonist and magnesium sulfate infusion has been associated with fewer hospitalizations. Patients needing admission to the hospital require continued monitoring and systemic therapy similar to treatments used in the emergency department. Improvement in symptoms and forced expiratory volume in one second or peak expiratory flow to 60% to 80% of predicted values helps determine appropriateness for discharge. The addition of inhaled corticosteroids, consideration of stepping up asthma maintenance therapy, close follow-up, and education on asthma action plans are important next steps to prevent future exacerbations.

### Pediatric acute asthma exacerbations: evaluation and management from emergency department to intensive care unit [^112GBa4E]. The Journal of Asthma (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

The goal of this report is to review available modalities for assessing and managing acute asthma exacerbations in pediatric patients, including some that are not included in current expert panel guidelines. While it is not our purpose to provide a comprehensive review of the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) guidelines, we review NAEPP-recommended treatments to provide the full range of treatments available for managing exacerbations with an emphasis on the continuum of care between the ER and ICU.

We searched PubMed using the following search terms in different combinations: asthma, children, pediatric, exacerbation, epidemiology, pathophysiology, guidelines, treatment, management, oxygen, albuterol, β2-agonist, anticholinergic, theophylline, corticosteroid, magnesium, heliox, BiPAP, ventilation, mechanical ventilation, non-invasive mechanical ventilation and respiratory failure. We attempted to weigh the evidence using the hierarchy in which meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) provide the strongest evidence, followed by individual RCTs, followed by observational studies. We also reviewed the NAEPP and Global Initiative for Asthma expert panel guidelines.

Results and Conclusions

Asthma is the most common chronic disease of childhood, and acute exacerbations are a significant burden to patients and to public health. Optimal assessment and management of exacerbations, including appropriate escalation of interventions, are essential to minimize morbidity and prevent mortality. While inhaled albuterol and systemic corticosteroids are the mainstay of exacerbation management, escalation may include interventions discussed in this review.

### Aerosolized magnesium sulfate for acute asthma: a systematic review [^116NhTEE]. Chest (2005). Low credibility.

Background

The use of MgSO(4) is one of numerous treatment options available during exacerbations of asthma. While the efficacy of therapy with IV MgSO(4) has been demonstrated, little is known about inhaled MgSO(4).

Objectives

A systematic review of the literature was performed to examine the effect of inhaled MgSO(4) in the treatment of patients with asthma exacerbations in the emergency department.

Methods

Randomized controlled trials were eligible for inclusion and were identified from the Cochrane Airways Group "Asthma and Wheez" register, which consists of a combined search of the EMBASE, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and CINAHL databases and the manual searching of 20 key respiratory journals. Reference lists of published studies were searched, and a review of the gray literature was also performed. Studies were included if patients had been treated with nebulized MgSO(4) alone or in combination with beta(2)-agonists and were compared to the use of beta(2)-agonists alone or with an inactive control substance. Trial selection, data extraction, and methodological quality were assessed by two independent reviewers. The results from fixed-effects models are presented as standardized mean differences (SMDs) for pulmonary functions and the relative risks (RRs) for hospital admission. Both are displayed with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

Results

Six trials involving 296 patients were included. There was a non-significant increase in pulmonary function between patients whose treatments included nebulized MgSO(4) and those whose treatments did not (SMD, 0.22; 95% CI, -0.02 to 0.47 five studies); there was also a trend toward reduced hospitalizations in patients whose treatments included nebulized MgSO(4) (RR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.41 to 1.09; four studies). Subgroup analyses demonstrated that lung function improvement was similar in adult patients and in those patients who received nebulized MgSO(4) in addition to a beta(2)-agonist.

Conclusions

The use of nebulized MgSO(4), particularly in addition to a beta(2)-agonist, in the treatment of an acute asthma exacerbation appears to produce benefits with respect to improved pulmonary function and may reduce the number of hospital admissions.

### Management of life-threatening asthma: severe asthma series [^117K2uLd]. Chest (2022). Medium credibility.

Asthma exacerbations can be life-threatening, with 25,000 to 50,000 such patients per year requiring admission to an ICU in the United States. Appropriate triage of life-threatening asthma is dependent on both static assessment of airway function and dynamic assessment of response to therapy. Treatment strategies focus on achieving effective bronchodilation with inhaled β 2 -agonists, muscarinic antagonists, and magnesium sulphate while reducing inflammation with systemic corticosteroids. Correction of hypoxemia and hypercapnia, a key in managing life-threatening asthma, occasionally requires the incorporation of noninvasive mechanical ventilation to decrease the work of breathing. Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation should not be delayed if clinical improvement is not achieved with conservative therapies. However, mechanical ventilation in these patients often requires controlled hypoventilation, adequate sedation, and occasional use of muscle relaxation to avoid dynamic hyperinflation, which can result in barotrauma or volutrauma. Sedation with ketamine or propofol is preferred because of their potential bronchodilation properties. In this review, we outline strategies for the assessment and management of patients with acute life-threatening asthma focusing on those requiring admission to the ICU.

### Role of nebulised magnesium sulfate in treating acute asthma in children: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113hqCJX]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2024). High credibility.

Recent GINA updates (2023) suggest against routine use of intravenous MgSO 4, but at the same time, advocate considering it in patients with severe asthma who do not respond to first-line treatment. Though robust data do not support this recommendation, one may argue that there are some potential beneficial effects on pulmonary functions and clinical outcomes, like hospitalisation, without any significant increase in adverse event rates. Hence, it may be justified until better therapies are available. However, the same guideline from GINA suggests considering nebulised MgSO 4 as an adjuvant to salbutamol and ipratropium in children aged > 2 years with severe exacerbation. The evidence does not support this recommendation well. The index systematic review did not observe any significant effect on critical clinical outcomes. The lack of efficacy was consistently seen across almost all studies included in the review, adding to the robustness of the results. Similar observations were reported in previous systematic reviews on nebulised MgSO 4 in children. There was significant improvement (though of lesser magnitude) in PEFR with nebulised MgSO 4, as observed with intravenous MgSO 4 as well, but there was no significant change in FEV 1. However, unlike intravenous MgSO 4, it does not translate to improved clinical outcomes. These findings suggest that the 2023 GINA recommendations might not be in coherence with the updated review and need a revisit on this aspect.

### Use of nebulised magnesium sulphate as an adjuvant in the treatment of acute exacerbations of COPD in adults: a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial [^113XoWAA]. Thorax (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Intravenous magnesium has been shown to cause bronchodilation in acute severe asthma and in small trials in acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD). There is also some evidence of benefit from nebulised magnesium in acute severe asthma. Our hypothesis was that adjuvant magnesium treatment administered via repeated nebulisation was effective in the management of AECOPD.

Methods

In this randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial, we approached 161 patients with AECOPD presenting to the emergency departments at two New Zealand hospitals with a forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) < 50% predicted 20 min after initial administration of salbutamol 2.5 mg and ipratropium 500 µg via nebulisation. Patients received 2.5 mg salbutamol mixed with either 2.5 mL isotonic magnesium sulphate (151 mg per dose) or 2.5 mL isotonic saline (placebo) on three occasions at 30 min intervals via nebuliser. The primary outcome measure was FEV1 at 90 min.

Results

116 patients were randomised, 52 of whom were randomly allocated to the magnesium adjuvant group. At 90 min the mean (SD) FEV1 in the magnesium group (N = 47) was 0.78 (0.33) l compared with 0.81 (0.30) l in the saline group (N = 61) (difference -0.026 l (95% CI -0.15 to 0.095, p = 0.67). No patients required non-invasive ventilation. There were 43/48 admissions to hospital in the magnesium group and 56/61 in the saline group (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.10, p = 0.69).

Conclusions

Nebulised magnesium as an adjuvant to salbutamol treatment in the setting of AECOPD has no effect on FEV1. Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN12608000167369.

### Comparison of nebulized magnesium sulfate plus albuterol to nebulized albuterol plus saline in children with acute exacerbations of mild to moderate asthma [^114QXZUK]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

A prospective, randomized, double blinded study was conducted to determine whether a combination of nebulized magnesium sulfate and albuterol as a single dose adds any benefit in management of children with mild to moderate asthma when compared to nebulized albuterol with saline. The difference in FEV1 was significant at 10 and 20 min after a single dose of the combined treatment with magnesium and albuterol when compared with the albuterol and saline group (1.41 L ± 0.53 vs. 1.13 L ± 0.34, respectively, p = 0.03). The addition of magnesium to albuterol seems to provide short-term benefits in children with acute exacerbations of mild to moderate asthma.

### Analysis of guideline recommendations for treatment of asthma exacerbations in children: a pediatric emergency research networks (PERN) study [^113pE4ip]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2024). Medium credibility.

Rationale

There is significant practice variation in acute paediatric asthma, particularly severe exacerbations. It is unknown whether this is due to differences in clinical guidelines.

Objectives

To describe and compare the content and quality of clinical guidelines for the management of acute exacerbations of asthma in children between geographic regions.

Methods

Observational study of guidelines for the management of acute paediatric asthma from institutions across a global collaboration of six regional paediatric emergency research networks.

Measurements and Main Results

158 guidelines were identified. Half provided recommendations for at least two age groups, and most guidelines provided treatment recommendations according to asthma severity. There were consistent recommendations for the use of inhaled short-acting beta-agonists and systemic corticosteroids. Inhaled anticholinergic therapy was recommended in most guidelines for severe and critical asthma, but there were inconsistent recommendations for its use in mild and moderate exacerbations. Other inhaled therapies such as helium-oxygen mixture (Heliox) and nebulised magnesium were inconsistently recommended for severe and critical illness. Parenteral bronchodilator therapy and epinephrine were mostly reserved for severe and critical asthma, with intravenous magnesium most recommended. There were regional differences in the use of other parenteral bronchodilators, particularly aminophylline. Guideline quality assessment identified high ratings for clarity of presentation, scope and purpose, but low ratings for stakeholder involvement, rigour of development, applicability and editorial independence.

Conclusions

Current guidelines for the management of acute paediatric asthma exacerbations have substantial deficits in important quality domains and provide limited and inconsistent guidance for severe exacerbations.

### Management of asthma and COPD exacerbations in adults in the ICU [^114Cxgat]. CHEST Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Other Medications

IV magnesium sulfate has been shown to reduce hospitalizations among patients with life-threatening asthma exacerbations and COPD exacerbations in the ED, and it should be considered in patients not responding to initial therapies (Table 2).– The use of ketamine, a dissociative analgesic with bronchodilator effects, has been suggested in patients who are not intubated at low, subdissociative doses; however, quality data showing a clinical benefit are lacking. Some interest exists in using biologic agents in asthma exacerbations, given their relatively quick onset over days, although data have been limited to case reports and 1 randomized controlled trial (RCT) demonstrating that benralizumab administered in the ED reduced the rate of recurrent exacerbations in the subsequent 12 weeks. Methylxanthines (eg, theophylline and aminophylline) and terbutaline, an IV β 2 -agonist, are not recommended for asthma or COPD exacerbations among adults because of their lack of efficacy compared with inhaled β 2 -agonists, and methylxanthines are associated with increased side effects and adverse events such as tachyarrhythmias.

Inhaled Gases

The use of volatile anesthetics for life-threatening asthma exacerbations has been described in case reports, although prospective data are insufficient to support their use outside of refractory cases of bronchospasm until further research is carried out. – No role currently exists for volatile anesthetics in severe COPD exacerbations because studies show mixed effects on respiratory mechanics compared with IV sedation. Helium-oxygen (heliox) mixtures, used to promote laminar flow and to reduce airway resistance, may improve respiratory mechanics during severe asthma exacerbations, although data are limited on meaningful clinical outcomes in this population. – Among COPD exacerbations requiring NIV or IMV, heliox improves the work of breathing and intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEPi). Two RCTs of COPD exacerbations requiring NIV found that heliox did not prevent NIV failure; however, trends toward lower intubation rates and greater time to NIV failure were noted in the heliox group. – Heliox could be considered on a case-by-case basis as an adjunct therapy for patients with severe asthma and COPD exacerbations refractory to other treatments.

### Evaluation and management of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation in the emergency department [^116nx1i2]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Obstructive lung disease includes asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Exacerbation of asthma or COPD can result in significant morbidity and mortality, and emergency department (ED) care is often required. ED evaluation should assess risk factors for severe exacerbation and the patient's hemodynamic and respiratory status. Assessments including chest radiograph, point-of-care ultrasound, capnography, and electrocardiogram can assist. First-line treatments for acute exacerbation include bronchodilators and corticosteroids. Noninvasive ventilation, magnesium, ketamine, and epinephrine should be considered in those with severe exacerbation. Mechanical ventilation is challenging and should use an obstructive lung strategy with permissive hypercapnia.

### A randomized clinical trial of nebulized magnesium sulfate in addition to albuterol in the treatment of acute mild-to-moderate asthma exacerbations in adults [^114KMX8M]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Study Objective

We sought to compare the efficacy and safety of nebulized magnesium sulfate (MgSO(4)) plus albuterol with that of albuterol alone in adult patients with mild-to-moderate acute asthma exacerbations.

Methods

Patients were randomized to receive nebulized MgSO(4) (384 mg in 6 mL of sterile water) or an equal volume of placebo (normal saline solution) in a double-blind fashion after each dose of nebulized albuterol administered (2.5 mg/3 mL) every 20 minutes for the first hour of the study. Spirometry was performed at baseline and every 20 minutes for 2 hours. Monitoring for safety included vital signs, pulse oximetry, and serum magnesium levels. Improvement in percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second was chosen as a primary efficacy end point.

Results

Among 74 patients enrolled, 37 were randomized to each of 2 study groups. There were no statistically or clinically significant differences between the 2 study groups in percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second at any point during the trial or overall. There were no significant differences in vital signs, pulse oximetry, or serum magnesium levels at any point during the study.

Conclusion

The combination of nebulized MgSO(4) and albuterol provides no benefit in addition to that provided by therapy with albuterol in adult patients with mild-to-moderate asthma exacerbations. The efficacy of nebulized MgSO(4) in patients with severe asthma exacerbations remains unknown.

### Prospective observational study of clinical outcomes after intravenous magnesium for moderate and severe acute asthma exacerbations in children [^113RFMVk]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

There is limited knowledge regarding whether intravenous magnesium (IV-Mg) improves outcomes in children with acute asthma exacerbations.

Objective

To examine whether IV-Mg improves outcomes in children with moderate and severe exacerbations.

Methods

We performed a secondary analysis using data from a prospective observational cohort of children aged 5 to 17 years with moderate and severe exacerbations. Standardized treatment included systemic corticosteroid and inhaled albuterol, with consideration of IV-Mg (75 mg/kg) for patients with insufficient response after 20 minutes. Propensity score (PS) models were used to examine associations of IV-Mg treatment with change in the validated Acute Asthma Intensity Research Score, hospitalization rate, and time to spacing of inhaled albuterol of 4 hours or more among hospitalized participants.

Results

Among 301 children, median (interquartile range) age was 8.1 (6.4–10.2) years, 170 were Black (57%), 201 were male (67%), and 84 received IV-Mg (28%). In a PS covariate-adjusted multivariable linear regression model, IV-Mg treatment was associated with a 2-hour increase in the Acute Asthma Intensity Research Score (β-coefficient = 0.98; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.20–1.77), indicating increased exacerbation severity. Three additional PS-based models yielded similar results. Participants receiving IV-Mg had 5.8-fold (95% CI, 2.8–11.9) and 6.8-fold (95% CI, 3.6–12.9) greater odds of hospitalization in PS-based multivariable regression models. Among hospitalized participants, there was no difference in time to albuterol of every 4 hours or more in a PS covariate-adjusted Cox proportional hazards model (hazard ratio = 1.2; 95% CI, 0.8–1.8).

Conclusions

Among children with moderate and severe exacerbations, IV-Mg is associated with increased exacerbation severity, increased risk for hospitalization, and no acceleration in exacerbation resolution among hospitalized participants.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^113PWQWx]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Management of asthma exacerbations in a primary care or acute care facility calls to assess severity from dyspnea, respiratory rate, pulse rate, oxygen saturation and lung function while starting SABA and oxygen therapy, with infection control procedures followed. Arrange immediate transfer to an acute care facility for signs of severe exacerbation, or to intensive care if the patient is drowsy, confused, or has a silent chest; during transfer, give inhaled SABA and ipratropium bromide, controlled oxygen and systemic corticosteroids. Start treatment with repeated administration of SABA (in most patients, by pressurized metered-dose inhaler [pMDI] and spacer), early oral corticosteroids, and controlled flow oxygen if available; review response of symptoms, oxygen saturation and lung function after 1 hour, and give ipratropium bromide only for severe exacerbations. Consider intravenous magnesium sulfate for patients with severe exacerbations not responding to initial treatment. Do not routinely request a chest X-ray, and do not routinely prescribe antibiotics for asthma exacerbations. Decide about hospitalization based on clinical status, lung function, response to treatment, recent and past exacerbations, and ability to manage at home.

Sensitivity and subgroup analysis

We aimed to assess the effect of studies with high-risk bias on all outcomes. However, none of the included studies were at high risk of bias, precluding this analysis. Similarly, there was significant overlap in age groups and asthma severity (most have moderate to severe asthma), precluding subgroup analysis based on these variables. Because of the above reasons, these variables could not be included in the meta-regression analysis. We did a meta-regression analysis for a cumulative dose of MgSO 4 (in mg) for the primary outcome. There was no significant relationship between asthma control and MgSO 4 dose (coefficient: −0.00009; 95% CI: −0.0004 to 0.00002, p = 0.4). Seven studiesused salbutamol alone in both groups (along with intervention/placebo), whereas three studiesused ipratropium bromide as an additional therapy. This difference in intervention might introduce heterogeneity and affect the outcomes. Therefore, we decided to do subgroup analysis (post hoc) to explore the effect of ipratropium bromide. No significant subgroup differences were observed with or without ipratropium bromide addition (online supplemental table 4).

Publication bias

Though there were limited studies for publication bias, we did funnel plot analysis considering that six studies (a minimum requirement) were available for the primary outcome. There was no evidence of publication bias (online supplemental figure 5). However, due to a limited number of studies, the test may not be able to identify the true bias (if any); hence, it should be interpreted cautiously.

Certainty of evidence

We followed updated GRADE recommendations to evaluate the certainty of the evidence and described it in table 1. Evidence for most outcomes was of low or very low certainty only.

### A randomized trial of magnesium in the emergency department treatment of children with asthma [^116q84et]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2000). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Magnesium sulfate has been shown to benefit asthmatic children and adults with poor responses to initial beta(2)-agonist therapy in the emergency department. We sought to determine whether the routine early administration of high-dose magnesium would benefit moderate to severely ill children with acute asthma.

Methods

This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 54 children 1 to 18 years of age who presented to the ED of a tertiary care children's hospital with a moderate to severe asthma exacerbation. After receiving a nebulized albuterol treatment (0.15 mg/kg) and methylprednisolone (1 mg/kg), patients were randomly assigned to receive either 75 mg/kg of magnesium sulfate (maximum 2.5 g) or placebo. Thereafter, all patients were treated with frequent nebulized albuterol following a structured protocol. The main outcome was degree of improvement as assessed by Pulmonary Index scores over 120 minutes. Secondary outcomes included hospitalization rates and time required to meet discharge criteria.

Results

The mean change in Pulmonary Index score from baseline to 120 minutes was 2.83 for the magnesium group compared with 2.66 for the placebo group (95% confidence interval -1. 24 to 1.60). Eleven (46%) of 24 magnesium-treated patients were hospitalized compared with 16 (53%) of 30 in the placebo group (95% confidence interval -19% to 34%). There were no statistically significant differences between the groups with respect to time required to meet discharge criteria.

Conclusion

The routine administration of high-dose magnesium to moderate to severely ill children with asthma, as an adjunct to initial treatment with albuterol and corticosteroids, was not efficacious.

### Interventions for managing asthma in pregnancy [^116XGnxo]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma is the most common respiratory disorder complicating pregnancy, and is associated with a range of adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes. There is strong evidence however, that the adequate control of asthma can improve health outcomes for mothers and their babies. Despite known risks of poorly controlled asthma during pregnancy, a large proportion of women have sub-optimal asthma control, due to concerns surrounding risks of pharmacological agents, and uncertainties regarding the effectiveness and safety of different management strategies.

Objectives

To assess the effects of interventions (pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic) for managing women's asthma in pregnancy on maternal and fetal/infant outcomes.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (2 June 2014) and the Cochrane Airways Group's Trials Register (4 June 2014).

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing any intervention used to manage asthma in pregnancy, with placebo, no intervention, or an alternative intervention. We included pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions (including combined interventions). Cluster-randomised trials were eligible for inclusion (but none were identified). Cross-over trials were not eligible for inclusion. We included multi-armed trials along with two-armed trials. We also included studies published as abstracts only.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility and quality and extracted data. Data were checked for accuracy.

Main Results

We included eight trials in this review, involving 1181 women and their babies. Overall we judged two trials to be at low risk of bias, two to be of unclear risk of bias, and four to be at moderate risk of bias. Five trials assessed pharmacological agents, including inhaled corticosteroids (beclomethasone or budesonide), inhaled magnesium sulphate, intravenous theophylline, and inhaled beclomethasone verus oral theophylline. Three trials assessed non-pharmacological interventions, including a fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FENO)-based algorithm versus a clinical guideline-based algorithm to adjust inhaled corticosteroid therapy, a pharmacist-led multi-disciplinary approach to management versus standard care, and progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) versus sham training. The eight included trials were assessed under seven separate comparisons. Pharmacological interventionsPrimary outcomes: one trial suggested that inhaled magnesium sulphate in addition to usual treatment could reduce exacerbation frequency in acute asthma (mean difference (MD) -2.80; 95% confidence interval (CI) -3.21 to -2.39; 60 women). One trial assessing the addition of intravenous theophylline to standard care in acute asthma did not report on exacerbations (65 women). No clear difference was shown in the risk of exacerbations with the use of inhaled beclomethasone in addition to usual treatment for maintenance therapy in one trial (risk ratio (RR) 0.36; 95% CI 0.13 to 1.05; 60 women); a second trial also showed no difference, however data were not clearly reported to allow inclusion in a meta-analysis. No difference was shown when inhaled beclomethasone was compared with oral theophylline for maintenance therapy (RR 0.88; 95% CI 0.59 to 1.33; one trial, 385 women). None of these trials reported on neonatal intensive care admissions.

Secondary Outcomes

inhaled magnesium sulphate in acute asthma was shown to improve lung function measures (one trial, 60 women); intravenous theophylline in acute asthma was not associated with benefits (one trial, 65 women). No clear differences were seen with the addition of inhaled corticosteroids to routine treatment in three trials (374 women). While inhaled beclomethasone, compared with oral theophylline, significantly reduced treatment discontinuation due to adverse effects in one trial (384 women), no other differences were observed, except for higher treatment adherence with theophylline. Four of the five trials did not report on adverse effects. Non-pharmacological interventionsPrimary outcomes: in one trial, the use of a FENO-based algorithm was shown to significantly reduce asthma exacerbations (RR 0.61; 95% CI 0.41 to 0.90; 220 women); and a trend towards fewer neonatal hospitalisations was observed (RR 0.46; 95% CI 0.21 to 1.02; 214 infants). No exacerbations occurred in one trial assessing pharmacist-led management; this approach did not reduce neonatal intensive care admissions (RR 1.50; 95% CI 0.27 to 8.32; 58 infants). One trial (64 women) assessing PMR did not report on exacerbations or neonatal intensive care admissions.

Secondary Outcomes

the use of a FENO-based algorithm to adjust therapy led to some improvements in quality of life scores, as well as more frequent use of inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting β-agonists, and less frequent use of short-acting β-agonists (one trial, 220 women). The FENO-based algorithm was associated with fewer infants with recurrent episodes of bronchiolitis in their first year of life, and a trend towards fewer episodes of croup for infants. Pharmacist-led management improved asthma control scores at six months (one trial, 60 women); PMR improved lung function and quality of life measures (one trial, 64 women). No other differences between comparisons were observed.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on eight included trials, of moderate quality overall, no firm conclusions about optimal interventions for managing asthma in pregnancy can be made. Five trials assessing pharmacological interventions did not provide clear evidence of benefits or harms to support or refute current practice. While inhaled magnesium sulphate for acute asthma was shown to reduce exacerbations, this was in one small trial of unclear quality, and thus this finding should be interpreted with caution. Three trials assessing non-pharmacological interventions provided some support for the use of such strategies, however were not powered to detect differences in important maternal and infant outcomes. While a FENO-based algorithm reduced exacerbations, the effects on perinatal outcomes were less certain, and thus widespread implementation is not yet appropriate. Similarly, though positive effects on asthma control were shown with PMR and pharmacist-led management, the evidence to date is insufficient to draw definitive conclusions. In view of the limited evidence base, further randomised trials are required to determine the most effective and safe interventions for asthma in pregnancy. Future trials must be sufficiently powered, and well-designed, to allow differences in important outcomes for mothers and babies to be detected. The impact on health services requires evaluation. Any further trials assessing pharmacological interventions should assess novel agents or those used in current practice. Encouragingly, at least five trials have been identified as planned or underway.

### Intravenous or nebulised magnesium sulphate versus standard therapy for severe acute asthma (3Mg trial): a double-blind, randomised controlled trial [^116g3Zus]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

Background

Previous studies suggested intravenous or nebulised magnesium sulphate (MgSO(4)) might improve respiratory function in patients with acute asthma. We aimed to determine whether intravenous or nebulised MgSO(4) improve symptoms of breathlessness and reduce the need for hospital admission in adults with severe acute asthma.

Methods

In our double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we enrolled adults (aged ≥ 16 years) with severe acute asthma at emergency departments of 34 hospitals in the UK. We excluded patients with life-threatening features or contraindication to study drugs. We used a central randomisation system to allocate participants to intravenous MgSO(4) (2 g in 20 min) or nebulised MgSO(4) (three 500 mg doses in 1 h) alongside standard therapy including salbutamol, or placebo control plus standard therapy alone. We assessed two primary outcome measures in all eligible participants who started treatment, according to assigned treatment group: the proportion of patients admitted to hospital within 7 days and breathlessness measured on a 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS) in the 2 h after initiation of treatment. We adjusted for multiple testing using Simes's method. The trial stopped before recruitment was completed because funding expired. This study is registered, number ISRCTN04417063.

Findings

Between July 30, 2008, and June 30, 2012, we recruited 1109 (92%) of 1200 patients proposed by the power calculation. 261 (79%) of 332 patients allocated nebulised MgSO(4) were admitted to hospital before 7 days, as were 285 (72%) of 394 patients allocated intravenous MgSO(4) and 281 (78%) of 358 controls. Breathlessness was assessed in 296 (89%) patients allocated nebulised MgSO(4), 357 (91%) patients allocated intravenous MgSO(4), and 323 (90%) controls. Rates of hospital admission did not differ between patients treated with either form of MgSO(4) compared with controls or between those treated with nebulised MgSO(4) and intravenous MgSO(4). Change in VAS breathlessness did not differ between active treatments and control, but change in VAS was greater for patients in the intravenous MgSO(4) group than it was in the nebulised MgSO(4) group (5.1 mm, 0.8 to 9.4; p = 0.019). Intravenous or nebulised MgSO(4) did not significantly decrease rates of hospital admission and breathlessness compared with placebo: intravenous MgSO(4) was associated with an odds ratio of 0.73 (95% CI 0.51 to 1.04; p = 0.083) for hospital admission and a change in VAS breathlessness of 2.6 mm (-1.6 to 6.8; p = 0.231) compared with placebo; nebulised MgSO(4) was associated with an odds ratio of 0.96 (0.65 to 1.40; p = 0.819) for hospital admission and a change in VAS breathlessness of -2.6 mm (-7.0 to 1.8; p = 0.253) compared with placebo.

Interpretation

Our findings suggest nebulised MgSO(4) has no role in the management of severe acute asthma in adults and at best suggest only a limited role for intravenous MgSO(4) in this setting.

### The role of oral magnesium supplements for the management of stable bronchial asthma: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1136sT22]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Asthma is a chronic lung disease characterized by airway inflammation and hyper-responsiveness of airway smooth muscles. There is growing evidence that magnesium may have a role in managing asthma through its dual effect as an anti-inflammatory and bronchodilating agent. To assess the efficacy of oral magnesium supplements in chronic asthmatic patients. In addition to searching through Clinicaltrials.gov/ and references for oral magnesium supplement studies, we performed a database search in Medline, CINAHL, CENTRAL, and Embase. We contacted the authors of the included trials to ask for additional information. We included randomized controlled trials that compared oral magnesium supplements versus placebo, in addition to standard asthma treatment in mild-moderate asthmatic adults and children (older than 6 years). Two reviewers independently performed the study selection, data abstraction, and the assessment of the risk of bias. Eight trials at moderate risk of bias enrolling a total of 917 patients were included. Oral magnesium improved FEV1 at week 8 (5.69 (L/min); 95% CI: 1.92, 9.46; I 2: 45%). There was no significant improvement in FEV1 at other follow up periods. There was no significant change in FVC, Methacholine challenge test, the frequency of bronchodilator use, or symptoms score. There were no data on mortality or quality of life. Oral magnesium supplements may lead to improvement in FEV1 that was only demonstrated at eight weeks; but no effect on any other outcome. Until future evidence emerges, oral magnesium cannot be recommended as adjuvants to standard treatment for mild to moderate asthmatic individuals.

### IV magnesium sulfate in the treatment of acute severe asthma: a multicenter randomized controlled trial [^113cmR7G]. Chest (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Studies of IV magnesium sulfate as a treatment for acute asthma have had mixed results, with some data suggesting a benefit for acute severe asthma, but not for mild-to-moderate asthma. In a multicenter cohort, this study tests the hypothesis that administration of magnesium sulfate improves pulmonary function in patients with acute severe asthma.

Design

Placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized clinical trial.

Setting

Emergency departments (EDs) of eight hospitals.

Patients

Patients aged 18 to 60 years presenting with acute asthma and FEV1 ≤ 30% predicted on arrival to the ED.

Intervention

All patients received nebulized albuterol at regular intervals and IV methylprednisolone. Two grams of IV magnesium sulfate or placebo were administered 30 min after ED arrival. The primary efficacy end point was FEV1 at 240 min, and the data analysis was intent to treat.

Results

Two hundred forty-eight patients were included, and the mean FEV1 on ED arrival was 22.9% predicted. At 240 min, patients receiving magnesium had a mean FEV1 of 48.2% predicted, compared to 43.5% predicted in the placebo-treated group (mean difference, 4.7%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.29 to 9.3%; p = 0.045). A regression model confirmed the effect of magnesium compared to placebo was greater in patients with a lower initial FEV1 (p < 0.05). If the initial FEV1 was < 25% predicted, the final FEV1 was 45.3% predicted in the magnesium-treated group and 35.6% predicted in the placebo-treated group (mean difference, 9.7%; 95% CI, 4.0 to 15.3%; p = 0.001). If the initial FEV was ≥ 25% predicted, magnesium administration was not beneficial; the final FEV1 was 51.1% predicted in the magnesium-treated group and 53.9% predicted in the placebo-treated group (mean difference, - 2.9%, 95% CI, - 9.4 to 3.7; p = not significant). Overall, the use of magnesium sulfate did not improve hospital admission rates.

Conclusion

Administration of 2 g of IV magnesium sulfate improves pulmonary function when used as an adjunct to standard therapy in patients with very severe, acute asthma.

### Principal findings of systematic reviews of acute asthma treatment in childhood [^113owe5M]. The Journal of Asthma (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study is to summarize the principal findings in the literature about acute asthma management in children.

Methods

Systematic reviews of randomized clinical trials (SRCTs) with or without meta-analysis in children (1–18 years) admitted to the emergency department (ED) were retrieved using five data bases. Methodological quality was determined using the AMSTAR tool.

Results

One hundred and three studies were retrieved. Among those, 28 SRCTs were included: seven SRCTs related to short-acting beta2-agonists (SABA), three to ipratropium bromide (IB), eight to corticosteroids, one to racemic adrenaline, one to leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRA), four to magnesium sulfate, one to intravenous (IV) SABA, one to IV aminophylline, one to IV ketamine, and one to antibiotics. It was determined that administering SABA by MDI-VHC is superior to using a nebulizer, because it decreases the hospital admission rate, improves the clinical score, results in a shorter time in the ED, and causes fewer adverse effects. Levalbuterol and albuterol were similar. In patients with moderate to severe exacerbations, IB+SABA was superior to SABA, decreasing hospital admission and improving the clinical score. SABA heliox administered by nebulizer decreased exacerbation severity compared to oxygen. Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), especially administered by nebulizer, showed results similar to oral corticosteroids (OCS) with respect to reducing hospital admission, unscheduled visits, and the requirement of additional systemic corticosteroids. ICS or OCS following ED discharge was similar with regard to relapse. Compared with a placebo, IV magnesium reduced hospital admission and improved lung function.

Conclusions

SRCTs are useful for guiding decisions in acute asthma treatment.

### Treatment patterns and frequency of key outcomes in acute severe asthma in children: a paediatric research in emergency departments international collaborative (PREDICT) multicentre cohort study [^113bR7NJ]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Asthma is a frequent reason for a child to attend the emergency department (ED), and one of the most common reasons for paediatric hospitalisation after an ED visit. In the USA, the rate (per population) of paediatric ED visits for asthma increased by 13.3% between 2001 and 2010, while in the UK, it is estimated that a child is admitted to hospital every 20 min due to an asthma exacerbation.

Most children with asthma have mild or moderate exacerbations, and respond to first-line treatment with inhaled bronchodilator therapy and systemic corticosteroids. However, a proportion of children require more intensive therapies including intravenous medications, supplemental oxygen, respiratory support, endotracheal intubation and/or admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). Management of acute severe asthma is complicated by a number of challenges, including the infrequency of its occurrence, a large number of treatment options and wide variation in self-reported and actual practice. Acute asthma has been highlighted as a research priority by multiple paediatric emergency medicine research networks.

A 2015 study from the UK found that 110 (3.4%) of 3238 children with acute asthma presenting to 24 EDs received intravenous therapy: magnesium in 2.1%, salbutamol in 1.9% and aminophylline in 1.6%. More than thirty different intravenous dosing and infusion regimens were identified in these 110 patients. In contrast, a study from the USA found that 10.5% of 61 854 children with acute asthma presenting to seven EDs between 2012 and 2017 received intravenous magnesium. No clinical characteristics explained the variation in intravenous magnesium use in the USA study, and the large difference between use of intravenous magnesium in the UK and USA studies remains unexplained. While intravenous magnesium has been found in meta-analysis to reduce both hospital admission and hospital length of stay (LOS), the quality of evidence is low, mainly due to small sample size.

### The use of magnesium sulfate in acute asthma: rapid uptake of evidence in north American emergency departments [^112AoGGj]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Systematic reviews of approximately 13 randomized trials support treatment with intravenous magnesium sulfate (MgSO(4)) in patients with severe acute asthma; however, little is known about its actual clinical use.

Objective

We sought to examine the use of intravenous MgSO(4) in the emergency department (ED) and physician attitudes toward its use.

Methods

Data for MgSO(4) use were obtained from observational cohort studies of ED patients with acute asthma. Investigators were asked about MgSO(4) through a brief Internet-based survey. The main outcomes were the percentage of sites reporting MgSO(4) use and patient factors that potentially modified the use of this agent.

Results

Among 9745 ED patients with acute asthma, 240 (2.5%) received MgSO(4). Increasing age, previous intubation, higher initial respiratory rate, lower initial PEF, higher number of beta-agonists in the ED, and use of systemic corticosteroids were associated with MgSO(4) use (P < .01). Overall, 103 (87%) of 119 potential sites completed the survey. Most (92%) respondents stated their EDs had MgSO(4) available, and 64% had recently used it. More respondents listed severity (96%) and failure to respond to initial beta-agonists (87%) as factors prompting their use of MgSO(4). Other factors, such as age, sex, and duration of exacerbation, less commonly influenced MgSO(4) use.

Conclusion

Most ED physicians accept the efficacy of MgSO(4) in acute asthma. Despite this belief and the ready availability of MgSO(4), its ED use remains uncommon (2.5% of cases). In both practice and theory, emergency physicians appear to appropriately restrict its use to patients with severe acute asthma.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^116mWAML]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Box 12–4 — Initial emergency department management of asthma exacerbations in children 5 years and younger outlines immediate therapies and dosing. Supplemental oxygen is delivered by face nasal prongs or mask to maintain oxygen saturation at 94–98%. Short-acting beta agonist (SABA) dosing is 2–6 puffs of salbutamol by spacer, or 2.5 mg by nebulizer, every 20 minutes for the first hour, then severity is reassessed; if symptoms persist or recur, give an additional 2–3 puffs per hour and admit to hospital if > 10 puffs are required in 3–4 hours. Systemic corticosteroids include an initial oral prednisolone dose of 1–2 mg/kg up to a maximum 20 mg for children < 2 years old or 30 mg for children 2–5 years, or intravenous methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg 6-hourly on day 1. Additional options in the first hour are to consider adding ipratropium bromide (1–2 puffs by pMDI and spacer; if poor response to initial SABA, nebulized ipratropium bromide 250 mcg every 20 minutes for 1 hour only) and to consider nebulized isotonic magnesium sulfate (150 mg) as 3 doses in the first hour for children aged ≥ 2 years with severe exacerbation. If inhalation is not possible, an intravenous bolus of terbutaline 2 mcg/kg may be given over 5 minutes, followed by continuous infusion of 5 mcg/kg/hour.

### International perspective on research priorities and outcome measures of importance in the care of children with acute exacerbations of asthma: a qualitative interview study [^116EDXne]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2023). High credibility.

Dominant theme: drivers of treatment decisions (knowledge)

There were similarities among providers in the first-line treatments for children with non-severe asthma, with all clinicians mentioning supplemental oxygen and short-acting beta agonists. There was some variability regarding the indication for steroids in mild-moderate asthma. There was considerable variation in the management of severe asthma: when discussing the use of a particular intravenous agent, the drivers of using escalated therapy and how the outcomes of treatment were measured (Knowledge, Motivation and Goals). Reasons for variation were attributed to personal clinical experience and knowledge of the existing literature.

My experience with magnesium is [that] it seems to be [a] safe and effective therapy. Australia, Paediatric Emergency Physician

I'm probably using aminophylline more in the last one to two years for the severe critical asthma that's going to ICU. Australia, Emergency Physician

Changed threshold of using IV/Oral corticosteroids. In the past reserved them only for patients who did not respond initially to therapy. Nowadays prescribe them to any patient with an exacerbation needing a hospital visit. Based on some research I had read at some point. Tanzania, Emergency Physician

The complexity of treatment decisions was highlighted as outlined below.

I would say that the decision is probably influenced by the time of the shift, whether it's day or night, whether there's a space where… [in] the ward or they're going to be needing ED for a long time, what the feeling of the nurses is. Costa Rica, Respiratory physician

There were different opinions on when respiratory support therapies such as the use of high flow nasal cannulae and non-invasive ventilation were used. (Skills/belief about capabilities)

### Global Initiative for Asthma strategy 2021: executive summary and rationale for key changes [^112c8V5R]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Start OCS early after presentation. For adults, give prednisolone 40–50 mg/d (or equivalent) for 5–7 days. For children, give prednisolone 1–2 mg/kg (maximum, 40 mg) for 3–5 days. Tapering is not needed if administered for < 2 weeks.

Review response of symptoms, vital signs, oxygen saturation and lung function after 1 hour (or earlier if worsening). Give ipratropium bromide only for severe exacerbations. Consider intravenous magnesium sulfate for patients with severe exacerbations not responding to initial treatment.

Do not routinely request chest radiography or routinely prescribe antibiotics for asthma exacerbations.

The decision on whether to hospitalize should be based on the patient's clinical status, lung function, response to treatment, recent and past history of exacerbations, social support, and ability to manage at home.

Rationale

Currently, inhaled albuterol is the usual bronchodilator in acute asthma management. Similar efficacy and safety of formoterol in the ED have been reported. In one study, high-dose budesonide–formoterol had similar efficacy and safety to SABA in ED patients.

Discharge Management

Before the patient goes home, arrange ongoing treatment. This should include starting ICS-containing controller treatment, preferably ICS–formoterol as MART (Table 1; Table E2 andin the online supplement) to reduce the risk of another exacerbation, or stepping up the dose of existing maintenance treatment for 2–4 weeks. Advise patients to use reliever medication as needed, not regularly. Patients prescribed ICS–formoterol as their reliever should return to this after an ED presentation.

### Intravenous and nebulised magnesium sulphate for acute asthma: systematic review and meta-analysis [^116RrXgj]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

To estimate the effect of intravenous and nebulised magnesium sulphate upon hospital admissions and pulmonary function in adults and children with acute asthma.

Methods

We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised and quasi-randomised trials of intravenous or nebulised magnesium sulphate in acute asthma. Trials were identified by searches of the electronic literature, relevant journal websites and conference proceedings, and contact with authors and experts. Data were pooled using random effects meta-analysis of the relative risk (RR) of hospital admission and the standardised mean difference (SMD) in pulmonary function.

Results

24 studies (15 intravenous, 9 nebulised) incorporating 1669 patients were included. Intravenous treatment was associated in adults with weak evidence of an effect upon respiratory function (SMD 0.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.01 to 0.51; p = 0.05), but no significant effect upon hospital admission (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.08; p = 0.22), and in children with a significant effect upon respiratory function (SMD 1.94, 95% CI 0.80 to 3.08; p < 0.001) and hospital admission (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.90; p = 0.005). Nebulised treatment was associated in adults with weak evidence of an effect upon respiratory function (SMD 0.17, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.36; p = 0.09), and hospital admission (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.02; p = 0.06), and in children with no significant effect upon respiratory function (SMD -0.26, 95% CI -1.49 to 0.98; p = 0.69) or hospital admission (RR 2.0, 95% CI 0.19 to 20.93; p = 0.56).

Conclusion

Intravenous magnesium sulphate appears to be an effective treatment in children. Further trials are needed of intravenous and nebulised magnesium sulphate in adults and nebulised magnesium sulphate in children.

### Treatment patterns and frequency of key outcomes in acute severe asthma in children: a paediatric research in emergency departments international collaborative (PREDICT) multicentre cohort study [^114NXEnj]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2022). High credibility.

In our cohort, the use of respiratory support varied ten-fold between hospitals and the use of parenteral treatment varied eight-fold. Intravenous magnesium was administered in 3.9%. This is nearly twice as frequent as reported in the UK and Ireland (2.1%)but less than half the rate reported in the USA (10.5%). Lack of high-quality evidence may contribute to this regional variation in practice. A 2016 Cochrane review of the use of intravenous magnesium for treating acute paediatric asthma in the ED found that the treatment may reduce the need for hospital admission and LOS, although this was based on limited data (admission, three studies of 115 children; LOS one study of 47 children). The authors concluded equipoise still exists and recommended further trials.

Similar to the UK study, we found a large number of combinations of parenteral bronchodilators were used. However, in 85% of children receiving escalated therapy with intravenous bronchodilator treatment, this was confined to just three different regimens; intravenous magnesium alone or in combination with either aminophylline or salbutamol. Once again, the lack of high-quality evidence, as well as inconsistent local guidelines, may contribute to this variation. While magnesium and salbutamol are listed as second-line and third-line bronchodilators for management of acute severe paediatric asthma in Australian national guidelines, some state-based guidelines prefer magnesium and aminophylline. In New Zealand, guidelines suggest consideration of all three without preference, while the Global Initiative for Asthma guidelines strongly recommend against aminophylline and states there is insufficient evidence to support the use of intravenous beta 2 -agonists.

Cochrane reviews of advanced pharmacologic treatment of children with acute exacerbations of asthma highlight a number of knowledge gaps. The evidence supporting intravenous magnesium is extremely limited (including only 5 studies and 182 children), while only one study (showing no significant benefit) was identified regarding intravenous ketamine. Despite a meta-analysis of nearly 3000 patients enrolled in trials of inhaled magnesium, review authors noted that large, well-conducted trials had not shown clinically meaningful benefits. This finding has been reinforced by a recent large study of over 800 children demonstrating no difference in hospitalisation when nebulised magnesium was added to nebulised albuterol. Studies on intravenous beta 2 -agonistsand/or intravenous aminophyllinehave not demonstrated clinically significant benefit, while there is no available Cochrane review on the utility of parenteral epinephrine for acute severe asthma in children.

### Use of isotonic nebulised magnesium sulphate as an adjuvant to salbutamol in treatment of severe asthma in adults: randomised placebo-controlled trial [^116LjEVv]. Lancet (2003). Excellent credibility.

Background

Intravenous magnesium can cause bronchodilation in treatment of severe asthma, however its effect by the nebulised route is uncertain. We aimed to assess the effectiveness of isotonic magnesium sulphate as an adjuvant to nebulised salbutamol in severe attacks of asthma.

Methods

We enrolled 52 patients with severe exacerbations of asthma presenting to the emergency departments at two hospitals in New Zealand. A severe exacerbation was defined as a forced expiratory volume at 1 s (FEV(1)) of less than 50% predicted 30 min after initial administration of 2.5 mg salbutamol via nebulisation. In this randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial patients received 2.5 mg nebulised salbutamol mixed with either 2.5 mL isotonic magnesium sulphate or isotonic saline on three occasions at 30 min intervals. The primary outcome measure was FEV(1) at 90 min. Analysis was per protocol.

Findings

At 90 min the mean FEV1 in the magnesium group was 1.96 L (95% CI 1.68–2.24) and in the saline group 1.55 L (1.24–1.87). The difference in the mean FEV(1) between the magnesium and saline groups was 0.37 L (0.13–0.61, p = 0.003).

Interpretation

Use of isotonic magnesium as an adjuvant to nebulised salbutamol results in an enhanced bronchodilator response in treatment of severe asthma.

### Intravenous magnesium sulfate for acute asthma exacerbations… [^117NW3PJ]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question Is intravenous magnesium sulfate effective for the treatment of acute asthma exacerbations. Evidence-Based Answer Patients presenting to the emergency department with an acute asthma exacerbation that has not responded to first-line therapy can be treated effectively with intravenous magnesium sulfate. In children, magnesium sulfate reduced hospital admissions by 68%. In adults, magnesium sulfate reduced admissions by 25%. Evidence Summary A 2016 Cochrane review of three RCTs found that treatment with intravenous magnesium sulfate reduced the odds of hospital admissions by 68% in patients 18 months to 18 years of age who presented to the emergency department with acute asthma exacerbations. A 2014 Cochrane review of 14 RCTs found a 25% reduction in hospital admissions in adults who were treated in the emergency department with intravenous magnesium sulfate for asthma exacerbation. 2 The number needed to treat to prevent one admission was 7. Most of the studies were double-blinded trials comparing intravenous magnesium sulfate vs. placebo after first-line therapy was ineffective. The authors reported statistically significant but clinically minimal improvements in the secondary outcomes of forced expiratory volume in one second and peak expiratory flow. Guidelines from the Global Initiative for Asthma recommend treating patients with acute asthma exacerbation with repeated doses of short-acting bronchodilators, early oral corticosteroids, and controlled-flow oxygen if available.

3 In those with severe exacerbations, ipratropium should be added and nebulized short-acting bronchodilators should be considered. In acute care facilities, intravenous magnesium sulfate may be considered if the patient does not respond to intensive initial treatment. Copyright © Family Physicians Inquiries Network.

### Intravenous magnesium: prompt use for asthma in children treated in the emergency department (IMPACT-ED), a pilot randomized trial [^116QhMof]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

LIMITATIONS

This pilot trial was not powered to detect a difference in hospitalization between study arms but will contribute to sample size estimates for a future trial. While the decision to hospitalize a patient is a clinical decision that also incorporates nonclinical issues in addition to illness severity, it is clinically important and valuable to examine in the setting of acute asthma because of its substantial impact on health care costs, its sensitivity to the timing and selection of specific treatments, and its common use as the primary outcome in clinical trials of asthma treatment for children.

### Intravenous and nebulized magnesium sulfate for treating acute asthma in adults and children: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114trugE]. Respiratory Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to estimate the effects of intravenous and nebulized magnesium sulfate on treating adults and children with acute asthma.

Methods

Electronic literature search and the manual search of key respiratory journals were performed up to October 18, 2011. Randomized controlled trials were included if patients had been treated with intravenous or nebulized magnesium sulfate in combination with β2-agonists and were compared with the use of β2-agonists. Standardized mean differences (SMDs) and the relative risks (RRs) were calculated for pulmonary functions and hospital admission respectively.

Results

25 trials (16 intravenous, 9 nebulized) involving 1754 patients were included. In adults intravenous treatment was associated with a significant effect upon respiratory function (SMD, 0.30; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.05 to 0.55; p = 0.02) but weak evidence of effect upon hospital admission (RR 0.86,95% CI 0.73 to 1.01; p = 0.06) in adults, and in children with significant effects upon both respiratory function (SMD, 1.94; 95% CI, 0.80 to 3.08; p = 0.0008) and hospital admission (RR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.91; p = 0.008). Nebulized treatment was associated with significant effects upon respiratory function (SMD, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.06 to 0.41; p = 0.009) and hospital admission (RR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.43 to 0.92; p = 0.02) in adults.

Conclusion

The use of intravenous magnesium sulfate, in addition to β2-agonists and systemic steroids, in the treatment of acute asthma appears to produce benefits with respect to improve pulmonary function and reduce the number of hospital admissions for children, and only improve pulmonary function for adults. However, the use of nebulized magnesium sulfate just appears to produce benefits for adults.

### Magnesium and outcomes in children with acute asthma… [^113pUxQ2]. AAFP (2001). Low credibility.

The increased prevalence of asthma in children has been accompanied by a rise in morbidity and mortality. Treatment for children presenting to emergency departments with moderate or severe exacerbation of asthma includes aggressive use of beta 2 agonists and systemic corticosteroids. Some children require hospitalization even with aggressive therapy. Magnesium sulfate has been used for more than 50 years to treat status asthmaticus and severe acute asthma without specific guidelines. Scarfone and associates studied the early administration of magnesium to moderately to severely ill children with asthma in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. The major outcome was the change in clinical asthma score over time; secondary outcome measures included hospitalization rates and time required to meet discharge criteria.

The study enrolled patients between two and 18 years of age with a past history of at least one prior episode of wheezing who presented to the emergency department with a moderate to severe asthma exacerbation. Patients who had used corticosteroids within 72 hours and who had any of a number of pulmonary, heart, liver or renal diseases were excluded. Pregnant patients also were excluded. Severity of asthma was scored using the pulmonary index. All children were initially treated with inhaled nebulized albuterol followed by a second albuterol treatment and intravenous methylprednisolone. Study participants were randomly given either 75 mg per kg of intravenous magnesium sulfate or intravenous placebo. All patients received three more albuterol treatments over the next two hours. Clinical assessment was performed at specific intervals to record PI score, oxygen saturation, pulse and blood pressure, and adverse effects were noted.

Discharge criteria included sustained good aeration, absent or minimal wheezing, minimal work of breathing and an oxygen saturation greater than 95 percent in room air. All patients went home and continued using inhaled albuterol and oral prednisone for five days. Of the 54 study subjects, 24 received magnesium sulfate and 30 received placebo. Children in both groups experienced a significant improvement in mean PI scores from baseline to 120 minutes. The authors found no evidence of a magnesium benefit nor did they find a difference in hospitalization rates between the two groups. Side effects of magnesium infusion were mild and included transient facial warmth, dry mouth and malaise. The authors conclude that among a cohort of moderately to severely ill asthmatic children treated with aggressive beta 2-agonist therapy and intravenous corticosteroids, high-dose magnesium offered no additional benefit when administered early in the course of treatment.

### Association between intravenous magnesium therapy in the emergency department and subsequent hospitalization among pediatric patients with refractory acute asthma: secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^117TiCUy]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this secondary analysis of an RCT, we found that the administration of IV magnesium therapy among children with refractory acute asthma was associated with hospitalization independent of asthma severity and other patient-level characteristics. Furthermore, after adjustment for patient-level characteristics, this association was also evident among children who met criteria for hospital discharge at the time of ED disposition. Future research on the benefit of IV magnesium therapy in reducing hospitalization and the related safety profile may clarify the role of this therapy in refractory pediatric asthma.

P208 Intravenous magnesium sulfate in the treatment of acute exacerbations of COPD: a randomized controlled trial

E Pishbin, E Vafadar Moradi

Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran

Introduction: Intravenous (IV) magnesium has an established role in the treatment of acute asthma attack. It is attractive as a bronchodilator because it is relatively cheap and has minimal side effects. There are few studies evaluating the effect of magnesium on acute exacerbation of COPD and the results of them are contradictory.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of IV magnesium sulfate in the treatment of patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with acute exacerbation of COPD.

Methods: In this randomized controlled trial, adult patients presented to the ED with acute exacerbation of COPD were randomly allocated in 2 groups. Patients in the study group received the standard treatment, plus 2 gram of IV magnesium sulfate and patients in the control group received the standard treatment, plus placebo. The outcomes included admission rate, intubation rate, changes in PEFR, SpO2 and dyspnea severity score. PEFR, SpO2 and dyspnea severity score were documented before the treatment and 20 minutes after administration of MgSO4 or placebo.

Results: 34 patients were included in the study (17 patients in each group), 16 patients were men and 18 patients were women. The study group had significantly more improvement in the dyspnea severity score (P = 0.001) and SpO2 (P = 0.004) as compared to the control group. But the difference in the changes in PEFR, intubation rate and admission rate were not clinically significant between 2 groups. (P > 0.05)

Conclusions: Adding magnesium sulfate to the standard treatment in patients with acute exacerbation of COPD leads to more improvement in dyspnea severity score and SpO2 although it does not reduce admission rate and intubation rate.

Small sample size and the dependency of PEFR on patient's effort are limitations of the present study. Furthermore we did not exclude the patients with the Cor pulmonale which may had an effect on the low response rate to MgSO4.

### Intravenous magnesium sulfate for bronchial hyperreactivity: a randomized, controlled, double-blind study [^113M3Spn]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Magnesium has been shown to be helpful in the treatment of acute exacerbations of asthma. Conflicting data exist concerning the effect of magnesium on bronchial hyperreactivity.

Methods

We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to investigate the effect of intravenous magnesium sulfate on bronchial reactivity to metacholine in 30 subjects with bronchial hyperreactivity. Two days after baseline metacholine provocation, 20 subjects received 0.3 mmol/kg/h of intravenous magnesium sulfate and 10 subjects received normal saline solution. Metacholine provocation was repeated 30 minutes after the initiation of the magnesium or placebo infusion.

Results

The difference of the postinterventional minus the baseline provocative dose of metacholine required to decrease the forced expiratory volume in 1 second by 20% (PC20) was significantly higher in the magnesium group compared with the placebo group (0.48 ± 0.46 mg/mL versus 0.05 ± 0.73 mg/mL, P = 0.028). In the magnesium group, the PC(20) significantly increased (from 0.83 ± 0.54 mg/mL to 1.31 ± 0.66 mg/mL, P = 0.0001), whereas there was no change in the placebo group (0.86 ± 0.52 mg/mL to 0.91 ± 0.54 mg/mL, P = 0.83).

Conclusions

In the magnesium group, 30% of the subjects reached a normal PC(20) compared with 10% in the placebo group. We conclude that intravenous magnesium sulfate significantly improved bronchial hyperreactivity and may serve as an adjunct to standard treatment.

### Clinical reasoning amongst paramedics using nebulised β ₂ agonists to treat acute asthma exacerbations: a qualitative study [^116DfmSt]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Globally the prevalence of asthma continues to increase, resulting in greater demand for prehospital and intrahospital services, with predicted increases in morbidity and mortality. According to the National Review of Asthma Deaths, optimisation of basic primary care can achieve significant reductions in these morbidity and mortality rates. Therefore, it is imperative that first-line treatment in the emergency setting and support during recovery is optimised in terms of effectiveness and timeliness.

However, despite asthma's heterogeneous nature, including different phenotypes and compounding variables such as comorbidities, the standard treatment for patients experiencing an exacerbation of asthma has remained constant for over forty years and involves the use of bronchodilator drugs (β₂ agonists) to relieve the associated bronchospasm. Notwithstanding, recent studies suggest that the use of β₂ agonists may result in negative short and long-term effects, with adverse physiological effects, such as arrhythmia, potentially resulting in reciprocal changes including altered blood pressures and modified respiratory patterns, or metabolic changes including increased blood glucose levels, all which can cause greater ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) mismatch –.

Nonetheless, current international asthma guidelines published by the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) continue to state that asthma patients in exacerbation should receive ' repetitive administration of short-acting inhaled bronchodilators, early introduction of systemic corticosteroids, and controlled flow oxygen supplementation ' which can be further supported with additional drugs as required, including ipratropium bromide and magnesium. However, in contrast to these guidelines and those published by the British Thoracic Society, UK ambulance services primarily focus on the use of β₂ agonists without the supplementation of corticosteroids, unless the exacerbation is severe or life-threatening in nature.

Given the divergence of asthma patients, the varying degrees of airway inflammation and the variety of physiological changes induced by first-line treatment during exacerbation, this study sought to explore the perceptions and experiences of ambulance paramedics managing acute exacerbations of asthma in the pre-hospital setting and how they alter their management in response to changes in physiological observations and in consideration of other variables.

This focus is important as healthcare providers may not record these observations or perceive them as problematic in the presence of an asthma exacerbation. Furthermore, patients experiencing an exacerbation may be managed solely by paramedics without subsequent examination by a hospital or General Practitioner (GP).

Secondary outcomes

Children who received MgSO 4 have significantly better PEFR (presented as % predicted) than the control group (2 RCTs, 145 participants; MD: 19.3; 95% CI: 8.9 to 29.8; I² = 0%) (figure 4A). However, there was no significant difference in FEV 1 (MD: 8.1; 95% CI: −3 to +19). We also compared the effect of MgSO 4 and placebo on physiological parameters (heart rate, respiratory rate and oxygen saturation). Infants who received MgSO 4 have slightly lower respiratory rates than the control group (MD: 0.9; 95% CI: −1.4 to −0.4); however, having any clinical significance was unlikely. There was no significant difference in heart rate and oxygen saturation (figure 4B). There was no significant difference in the need for hospitalisation, ICU admission or hospital stay (table 1 and online supplemental figures 1–3). There are some concerns that MgSO 4 can lead to respiratory depression, hypotension and bradycardia; therefore, we compared adverse events between the two groups as a safety outcome. We did not observe any increased adverse event rates with MgSO 4 (online supplemental figure 4 and table 1).

Introduction: Asthma is a serious illness seen regularly in emergency departments (ED) and hospitals frequently struggle to meet treatment guidelines. This study aims to audit the asthma exacerbation management in the ED [1].

Methods: Retrospective cohort study, including all adult patients admitted with asthma exacerbation to the ED of a tertiary care hospital, during 2022. The asthma management provided was compared with international GINA guidelines.

Results: There were 203 patients included in the study with a mean ± SD age of 51 ± 19 years, 152 (75%) were female and 194 (96%) had already an asthma diagnosis. There was no record on peak expiratory flow (PEF) measurement in any of the patients, the remaining clinical characteristics of the acute episodes allowed its classification in mild to moderate exacerbation in 92 (45%), severe in 102 (50%) and life-threatening in 9 (4%); 131 (64.5%) had at least one risk factor to increased mortality and despite the severity of the exacerbation only 2 (1%) were admitted to intensive care and 159 (78%) were discharged home. Concerning first approach: short-acting β-agonists (SABA) administration was register in 174 (86%), systemic corticosteroids in 171 (84%) and controlled oxygen in 197 (97%). Among those with severe and life-threatening asthma (n = 111): ipratropium bromide was administered in 100 (90%), magnesium sulfate in 34 (31%) and adrenaline in none. At discharge (n = 159), 88 (55%) had a short course of corticosteroids prescribed, in 10 (6%) the inhaler technic was review, in 37 (23%) the prescription plan was revised and 34 (22%) were oriented to follow-up.

Conclusions: This study identified as priority intervention areas the routine PEF measurement by healthcare professionals, to stratify the exacerbation of asthma, and planed discharge arrangements. An educational campaign directed towards emergency department physicians and nurses that attend these patients is being built to address these issues.

CONCLUSIONS

This pilot trial demonstrates that in a multi‐center randomized trial of early Intravenous magnesium sulfate in children with severe acute asthma, study drug can be delivered early in the ED course, measures of safety can be feasibly monitored during clinical care, and multiple blood samples can be obtained. Any future trial will require (1) flexibility to reach enrollment goals despite changing volumes of eligible participants, (2) refined trial procedures that are feasible for clinical providers in the environment of the ED, and (3) optimized processes to deliver study drug early enough to affect patient outcomes.

### Evaluation and treatment of critical asthma syndrome in children [^1147PAEF]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

The heterogeneity of asthma is illustrated by the significantly different features of pediatric asthma compared to adult asthma. One phenotype of severe asthma in pediatrics includes atopy, lack of reduction in lung function, and absence of gender bias as the main characteristics. Included in the NIH NAEPP EPR-3 are recommendations for the treatment and management of severe pediatric asthma and critical asthma syndrome, such as continuous nebulization treatments, intubation and mechanical ventilation, heliox, and magnesium sulfate. In addition, epinephrine, intravenous immunoglobulin, intravenous montelukast, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and many biological modulators currently under investigation are additional current and/or future treatment modalities for the severe pediatric asthmatic. But, perhaps the most important strategy for managing the severe asthmatic is preventative treatment, which can significantly decrease impairment and risk, particularly for severe acute exacerbations requiring emergency care and/or hospitalization. In order for preventative therapy to be successful, several challenges must be met, including selecting the correct therapy for each patient and then ensuring compliance or adherence to a treatment plan. The heterogeneity of asthma renders the former difficult in that not all patients will respond equally to the same treatment; the latter is only helpful if the correct treatment is employed. Strategies to ensure compliance include education of caregivers and patients and their families. As newer medications are introduced, options for individualized or customized medicine increase, and this may pave the way for significant decreases in morbidity and mortality in severe pediatric asthma.

To the Editor:

Patients with life-threatening asthma exacerbations who fail to improve on receiving standard and adjunctive therapies (eg, bronchodilators, glucocorticoids, magnesium, anesthetic/inhalational agents) are sometimes considered for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) as salvage therapy. However, reports describing ECMO initiation in patients with life-threatening asthma have varied in both the types of outcomes reported and their estimates. We synthesized the body of evidence, using meta-analyses to estimate the outcomes of adults with life-threatening asthma exacerbations who undergo ECMO.

### Magnesium use in asthma pharmacotherapy: a pediatric emergency research Canada study [^116oucN8]. Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

To examine the use of intravenous magnesium in Canadian pediatric emergency departments (EDs) in children requiring hospitalization for acute asthma and association of administration of frequent albuterol/ipratropium and timely corticosteroids with hospitalization.

Methods

Retrospective medical record review at 6 EDs of otherwise healthy children 2 to 17 years of age with acute asthma. Data were extracted on history, disease severity, and timing of ED stabilization treatments with inhaled albuterol, ipratropium, corticosteroids, and magnesium. Primary outcome was the proportion of hospitalized children given magnesium in the ED. Secondary outcome was the ED use of "intensive therapy" in hospitalized children, defined as 3 albuterol inhalations with ipratropium and corticosteroids within 1 hour of triage.

Results

A total of 19 (12.3%) of 154 hospitalized children received magnesium (95% confidence interval 7.1, 17.5) versus 2 of 962 discharged patients. Children given magnesium were more likely to have been previously admitted to ICU (odds ratio [OR] 11.2), hospitalized within the past year (OR 3.8), received corticosteroids before arrival (OR 4.0), presented with severe exacerbation (OR 6.1), and to have been treated at 1 particular center (OR 14.9). Forty-two (53%) of 90 hospitalized children were not given "intensive therapy". Children receiving "intensive therapy" were more likely to present with severe disease to EDs by using asthma guidelines (ORs 8.9, 3.0). Differences in the frequencies of all stabilization treatments were significant across centers.

Conclusions

Magnesium is used infrequently in Canadian pediatric EDs in acute asthma requiring hospitalization. Many of these children also do not receive frequent albuterol and ipratropium, or early corticosteroids. Significant variability in the use of these interventions was detected.

### Association between intravenous magnesium therapy in the emergency department and subsequent hospitalization among pediatric patients with refractory acute asthma: secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^116uchGV]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Methods

Study Design and Population

We conducted a post hoc secondary analysis of a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled RCT of children aged 2 to 17 years treated at 7 Pediatric Emergency Research Canada EDs for acute asthma from September 26, 2011, to November 19, 2019 (the trial protocol for the RCT is given in Supplement 1). This secondary analysis was performed from September to November 2020. The research ethics boards of the Hospital for Sick Children and of all participating sites approved the RCT and all data obtained during the study. Waiver of informed consent was not obtained for this secondary analysis because the parent trial included collection of all data used in this secondary analysis, and the consent form specified intravenous magnesium as a possible required treatment during trial participation. This study followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline.

Children enrolled in the RCT who continued to experience moderate to severe respiratory distress, defined by a PRAM score of 5 points or higher(Table 1)after 1 hour of standardized initial treatment with systemic corticosteroids and 3 treatments with inhaled albuterol and ipratropium bromide, were randomly assigned to receive three 20-minute treatments of nebulized albuterol (5 mg) plus either nebulized magnesium sulfate (600 mg) or 5.5% saline placebo via a pretested, high-efficiency Aeroneb Go nebulizer (Philips). After completion of this therapy (60 minutes after randomization), the ED physicians prescribed additional treatments such as IV magnesium sulfate as needed and decided whether to hospitalize patients according to their clinical judgement.

Abbreviation: NA, not applicable.

The RCT included children with a physician's diagnosis of asthma or a previous wheeze treated with inhaled bronchodilators or systemic corticosteroids. Children with comorbidities such as chronic lung disease, cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, neurologic disease, or other systemic diseases were excluded, as were those experiencing their first episode of asthmalike symptoms who may have had other diagnoses. Children needing immediate airway stabilization and those who received IV magnesium therapy before trial enrollment were also excluded.

Exposure

This secondary analysis used data from patients enrolled in the RCT who were administered IV magnesium after receipt of nebulized magnesium or placebo before disposition from the ED based on the clinical judgment of the treating ED physician. Magnesium was given by a continuous 30-minute IV infusion using magnesium doses of 40 to 75 mg/kg (maximum 2 g) in accordance with the local standard of care.
