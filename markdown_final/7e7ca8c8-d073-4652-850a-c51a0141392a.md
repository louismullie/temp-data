## Question

Does empaglifozin treatment in diabetes mellitus reduce proteinuria?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether empagliflozin reduces proteinuria in patients with diabetes mellitus. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how proteinuria is measured and why it matters clinically. Then, I should verify the highest-quality randomized trial evidence for empagliflozin's effect on albuminuria and hard renal outcomes. Next, I will examine dose–response by baseline albuminuria and consider subgroup data, including nephrotic-range proteinuria. After that, I should review meta-analyses and guideline positions to ensure consistency. Finally, I will synthesize a clinically actionable conclusion with caveats about timing, magnitude, and patient selection.

> Let me first confirm the clinical construct. Proteinuria in diabetes is typically quantified as the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR), with normoalbuminuria defined as UACR less than 30 mg/g, microalbuminuria as 30–300 mg/g, and macroalbuminuria as greater than 300 mg/g; reductions in albuminuria correlate with slower CKD progression and improved cardiovascular outcomes, so a treatment that lowers UACR meaningfully is clinically relevant [^115bwJby] [^115FJLRD].

> Now, I should verify the pivotal randomized evidence. In EMPA-REG OUTCOME, a double-blind trial in type 2 diabetes with established cardiovascular disease, empagliflozin reduced albuminuria as early as 12 weeks and sustained the reduction over approximately 3 years; placebo-adjusted UACR reductions were about 7% in normoalbuminuria, 25% in microalbuminuria, and 32% in macroalbuminuria, with higher likelihood of regression to a lower albuminuria category and less progression to higher categories, indicating both relative and categorical improvements in proteinuria [^115bwJby].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude and durability. The albuminuria-lowering effect was consistent across the treatment period and persisted after treatment cessation in those with baseline micro- or macroalbuminuria, whereas no significant change was seen in normoalbuminuria after stopping therapy; this pattern supports a true on-treatment effect rather than a transient hemodynamic blip, and mediation analyses suggest albuminuria reduction accounts for roughly 15–30% of empagliflozin's kidney benefit signal, reinforcing its clinical relevance [^115bwJby] [^115FJLRD].

> Next, I should review broader CKD populations to ensure generalizability. EMPA-KIDNEY, which enrolled patients with and without diabetes and included many with low albuminuria, showed that empagliflozin slowed chronic eGFR decline and reduced kidney disease progression or cardiovascular death; importantly, albuminuria reductions were observed across albuminuria strata, including those with minimal albuminuria, supporting benefit beyond highly proteinuric phenotypes [^116P9R89] [^115uq3ry].

> Hold on, I should verify effects in very high proteinuria. Post hoc analyses of EMPA-REG OUTCOME in participants with nephrotic-range proteinuria (UACR ≥ 2200 mg/g) showed that empagliflozin slowed eGFR decline and increased the likelihood of sustained albuminuria reductions, with approximately 60% achieving at least a 50% UACR reduction and meaningful proportions achieving partial or complete remission; these effects were observed on top of ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy, which is notable given the limited options in this high-risk group [^1136UFpK] [^111UB4FH] [^115MKsby].

> I need to check for class-level corroboration. A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials in diabetes found that SGLT2 inhibitors reduced albuminuria by a weighted mean difference of about 25% versus placebo or active control, with larger proportional reductions in those with moderate or severe albuminuria at baseline; this aligns with the dose–response pattern seen with empagliflozin and supports a class effect on proteinuria reduction [^112Pf8eo].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to ensure consistency with practice standards. Contemporary guidelines recommend SGLT2 inhibitors, including empagliflozin, for people with type 2 diabetes and CKD to slow CKD progression and reduce cardiovascular events, and they do not require albuminuria as a prerequisite for initiation. This reflects benefits observed across the albuminuria spectrum, including in patients with low baseline UACR [^113fNY3E] [^111Ei8NA] [^111Z7hMf].

> But wait, what about the initial eGFR dip and whether it blunts proteinuria interpretation. Empagliflozin causes a predictable, generally reversible 3–5 mL/min/1.73 m² decline in eGFR shortly after initiation due to hemodynamic effects; importantly, this acute dip does not negate long-term kidney protection and is not associated with harm signals in trial analyses, so clinicians should anticipate it and avoid premature discontinuation if it occurs [^111a2SUT] [^112wnFUT].

> Let me synthesize. Yes, empagliflozin reduces proteinuria in patients with diabetes, with consistent, clinically meaningful reductions in UACR observed as early as 12 weeks and sustained over years. The effect is larger in those with higher baseline albuminuria, including nephrotic-range proteinuria, and extends to patients with low albuminuria where the relative slowing of CKD progression is substantial. These findings are supported by randomized trials, meta-analyses, and guideline endorsements, and the albuminuria-lowering effect contributes to improved kidney outcomes independent of glycemic changes [^115bwJby] [^114bpzdA] [^116P9R89] [^112Pf8eo] [^113fNY3E].

> I should double-check practical implications. Clinicians should monitor UACR periodically to capture the antiproteinuric response, expect and manage the initial eGFR dip, and continue therapy down to eGFR thresholds supported by trials and labels, recognizing that kidney and cardiovascular benefits persist even when glycemic efficacy wanes at low eGFR; in patients with marked albuminuria, the absolute albuminuria reduction and the likelihood of regression are greater, which may translate into more pronounced slowing of CKD progression [^111Ei8NA] [^113fNY3E] [^115bwJby].

---

Empagliflozin **reduces proteinuria** in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, with the most pronounced effects in those with higher baseline albuminuria [^115bwJby] [^112Pf8eo]. This reduction is **independent of glycemic control** and is likely mediated by hemodynamic effects and direct renal protection [^113ifqV2] [^115ZjsRV]. Empagliflozin is recommended for patients with T2DM and CKD or albuminuria to slow kidney disease progression and reduce cardiovascular risk [^111Ei8NA] [^113oGzxF].

## Clinical evidence of proteinuria reduction

### EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial

- **Albuminuria reduction**: Empagliflozin reduced albuminuria by 7% in normoalbuminuria, 25% in microalbuminuria, and 32% in macroalbuminuria at 12 weeks, sustained through 164 weeks [^115bwJby].

- **Sustained improvement**: Higher likelihood of sustained improvement from micro to normoalbuminuria (HR 1.43) and from macro to lower categories (HR 1.82) [^115bwJby].

- **Renal outcomes**: Reduced incident or worsening nephropathy by 39% and progression to macroalbuminuria by 38% [^116BsyB6].

---

### EMPA-KIDNEY trial

In the EMPA-KIDNEY trial, **albuminuria reduction** was a 19% reduction in urine albumin versus placebo, consistent across diabetes status and baseline albuminuria [^115uq3ry]. The **kidney outcomes** showed a 28% reduction in kidney disease progression or cardiovascular death (HR 0.72) [^116P9R89].

---

### Meta-analyses and systematic reviews

Meta-analyses and systematic reviews show a **consistent albuminuria reduction** of ~25% versus placebo or active comparators [^112Pf8eo]. The **dose-response** relationship shows larger reductions with higher baseline albuminuria [^112Pf8eo].

---

## Mechanisms underlying proteinuria reduction

Empagliflozin's proteinuria reduction is **multifactorial**:

| **Mechanism** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Hemodynamic effects | Restores tubuloglomerular feedback, reducing intraglomerular pressure and hyperfiltration [^113ifqV2] [^115FJLRD] |
| Direct renal protection | Anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects, reducing glomerular injury and proteinuria [^115MKsby] |
| Glycemic control | Modest HbA1c reduction contributes to renal benefits [^112X1YWA] |

---

## Clinical significance of proteinuria reduction

Proteinuria reduction with empagliflozin is **clinically meaningful** because it slows CKD progression, with a 39% reduction in incident or worsening nephropathy [^116BsyB6] and improved renal outcomes in EMPA-KIDNEY [^116P9R89]. It also reduces cardiovascular risk, including lower cardiovascular death, heart failure hospitalization, and all-cause mortality [^112k5ukV].

---

## Patient populations benefiting from empagliflozin

Empagliflozin benefits patients with type 2 diabetes and **chronic kidney disease**, reducing proteinuria and slowing progression [^111Ei8NA] [^115bwJby]. It also benefits those with **albuminuria**, including patients with micro- or macroalbuminuria, including nephrotic-range proteinuria [^115bwJby] [^1136UFpK].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines recommend empagliflozin for patients with T2DM and CKD or albuminuria:

- **ADA 2025**: Use SGLT2 inhibitors, including empagliflozin, to reduce CKD progression and cardiovascular events in T2DM with CKD [^111Ei8NA].

- **AACE 2023**: SGLT2 inhibitors are foundational therapy for T2DM with DKD to reduce progression and cardiovascular risk [^113fNY3E].

- **ESC 2023**: Initiate SGLT2 inhibitors in T2DM with CKD to reduce cardiovascular and kidney outcomes [^113oGzxF].

---

## Safety considerations

Empagliflozin is **generally well tolerated**; monitor for genital mycotic infections, volume depletion, and ketoacidosis. Use is appropriate down to **eGFR 20 mL/min/1.73 m²** [^111Ei8NA] [^113oGzxF].

---

Empagliflozin **reduces proteinuria** in T2DM, with the largest effects in those with higher baseline albuminuria, and is recommended for T2DM with CKD or albuminuria to slow kidney disease progression and reduce cardiovascular risk.

### Empagliflozin improves kidney outcomes in patients with or without heart failure [^112MVzQg]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2019). Medium credibility.

Background In EMPA-REG OUTCOME (Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients) empagliflozin significantly reduced the risk of cardiovascular and kidney outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and established cardiovascular disease. Post hoc, we evaluated empagliflozin on kidney outcomes in patients with or without heart failure (HF). Methods and Results Individuals were randomized to empagliflozin 10 mg, 25 mg, or placebo. Prespecified analyses by baseline HF status included risk of incident or worsening nephropathy and estimated glomerular filtration rate slope analyses. Cox proportional hazards models assessed consistency of treatment effect across subgroups. Safety evaluations included kidney-related adverse events. At baseline, 244 (10.5%) and 462 (9.9%) patients had HF in the placebo and empagliflozin groups, respectively. Overall, the incidence of kidney outcome events was numerically higher in patients with than without HF. In the HF group, empagliflozin reduced risk of incident or worsening nephropathy or cardiovascular death by 43% (hazard ratio, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.42–0.77]) and progression to macroalbuminuria by 50% (hazard ratio, 0.50 [0.33–0.75]). After an initial transient decrease, estimated glomerular filtration rate stabilized over time with empagliflozin but gradually declined with placebo. Kidney effects in patients with HF were consistent with those in the overall study population (all P values for interaction > 0.05). Across groups, the incidence rate of kidney-related adverse events/100 patient-years was higher in patients with than without HF; however, overall rates were comparable between groups. Conclusions These findings from EMPA-REG OUTCOME support the hypothesis that empagliflozin could reduce the risk of clinically relevant kidney events and may slow progression of chronic kidney disease in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus regardless of HF status.

### SGLT2 inhibitors for the prevention of kidney failure in patients with type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111iUKEo]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2019). High credibility.

Background

The effects of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors on kidney failure, particularly the need for dialysis or transplantation or death due to kidney disease, is uncertain. Additionally, previous studies have been underpowered to robustly assess heterogeneity of effects on kidney outcomes by different levels of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and albuminuria. We aimed to do a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on major kidney outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes and to determine the consistency of effect size across trials and different levels of eGFR and albuminuria.

Methods

We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised, controlled, cardiovascular or kidney outcome trials of SGLT2 inhibitors that reported effects on major kidney outcomes in people with type 2 diabetes. We searched MEDLINE and Embase from database inception to June 14, 2019, to identify eligible trials. The primary outcome was a composite of dialysis, transplantation, or death due to kidney disease. We used random-effects models to obtain summary relative risks (RRs) with 95% CIs and random-effects meta-regression to explore effect modification by subgroups of baseline eGFR, albuminuria, and use of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockade. This review is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42019131774).

Findings

From 2085 records identified, four studies met our inclusion criteria, assessing three SGLT2 inhibitors: empagliflozin (EMPA-REG OUTCOME), canagliflozin (CANVAS Program and CREDENCE), and dapagliflozin (DECLARE-TIMI 58). From a total of 38723 participants, 252 required dialysis or transplantation or died of kidney disease, 335 developed end-stage kidney disease, and 943 had acute kidney injury. SGLT2 inhibitors substantially reduced the risk of dialysis, transplantation, or death due to kidney disease (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.52–0.86, p = 0.0019), an effect consistent across studies (I² = 0%, p heterogeneity = 0.53). SGLT2 inhibitors also reduced end-stage kidney disease (0.65, 0.53–0.81, p < 0.0001), and acute kidney injury (0.75, 0.66–0.85, p < 0.0001), with consistent benefits across studies. Although we identified some evidence that the proportional effect of SGLT2 inhibitors might attenuate with declining kidney function (p trend = 0.073), there was clear, separate evidence of benefit for all eGFR subgroups, including for participants with a baseline eGFR 30–45 mL/min per 1.73 m² (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.54–0.91, p = 0.0080). Renoprotection was also consistent across studies irrespective of baseline albuminuria (p trend = 0.66) and use of RAS blockade (p heterogeneity = 0.31).

Interpretation

SGLT2 inhibitors reduced the risk of dialysis, transplantation, or death due to kidney disease in individuals with type 2 diabetes and provided protection against acute kidney injury. These data provide substantive evidence supporting the use of SGLT2 inhibitors to prevent major kidney outcomes in people with type 2 diabetes.

### Kidney outcomes with SGLT2 inhibitor versus DPP4 inhibitor use in older adults with diabetes [^114MMWtd]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

If SGLT2 inhibitors demonstrate a clear preventive effect on kidney function decline in older adults with diabetes, their clinical significance would undoubtedly be profound. Post hoc analyses of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial (NCT01131676), a landmark trial demonstrating the advantage of SGLT2 inhibitor use, revealed that empagliflozin lowered the risk of cardiovascular events and kidney outcomes, regardless of age. Monteiro et al. categorized individuals enrolled in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial by baseline age (< 65, 65–74 and ≥ 75 years). They reported that the HRs of empagliflozin versus the placebo for incident or worsening nephropathy (defined as progression to macroalbuminuria, doubling of serum creatinine accompanied by eGFR ≤ 45 ml/min/1.73 m², initiation of renal placement therapy or death due to renal disease and components of incident or worsening nephropathy) were 0.61 (95% CI 0.51–0.73) in people < 65 years of age, 0.65 (95% CI 0.52–0.81) in those 65–74 years of age and 0.54 (95% CI 0.37–0.79) in those ≥ 75 years of age and found no interaction between baseline age and the effect of empagliflozin (P = 0.733). A VERTIS CV (NCT01986881) analysis, another RCT based on ertugliflozin, confirmed the kidney-protective effects of ertugliflozin and showed that the overall pattern of changes in eGFR with ertugliflozin versus placebo during the observational period was consistent across age subgroups (< 65 years versus ≥ 65 years and < 75 years versus ≥ 75 years).

### Sodium / glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors in chronic kidney disease and heart failure: ready for prime time in patients without diabetes [^112quvUz]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The benefits of sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors seem to extend beyond glycemic control. We review recent randomized trial evidence evaluating SGLT2 inhibition in nondiabetic settings, including in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and heart failure (HF).

Recent Findings

DAPA-CKD, DAPA-HF and EMPEROR-Reduced compared SGLT2 inhibitors to placebo, enrolling 5868 patients without diabetes. In DAPA-CKD, patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 25–75ml/min/1.73 m² and macroalbuminuria irrespective of kidney disease aetiology had improved cardiovascular and kidney outcomes if randomized to receive SGLT2 inhibitors (primary composite endpoint: hazard ratio [HR] 0.61, 95% CI 0.51–0.72; absolute risk reduction [ARR] 5.3%). In DAPA-HF and EMPEROR-Reduced, participants with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) had improved cardiovascular outcomes when an SGLT2 inhibitor was added to guideline-directed medical therapy, mainly through a reduction in HF hospitalizations (HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.59–0.83; ARR 3.7% and HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.59–0.81; ARR 5.1% with dapagliflozin and empagliflozin, respectively). In all 3 trials, the benefits were not modified by diabetes, baseline eGFR or proteinuria.

Summary

SGLT2 inhibitors improve kidney and HF outcomes in patients with high-risk CKD and HFrEF, irrespective of diabetes. Clinicians should become more comfortable prescribing these medications as we await studies that may further broaden their indications.

### Empagliflozin and cardiovascular and kidney outcomes across KDIGO risk categories: analysis of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational trial [^112V86o4]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

In the Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients (EMPA-REG Outcome), empagliflozin, in addition to standard of care, significantly reduced risk of cardiovascular death by 38%, hospitalization for heart failure by 35%, and incident or worsening nephropathy by 39% compared with placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease. Using EMPA-REG Outcome data, we assessed whether the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) CKD classification had an influence on the treatment effect of empagliflozin.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

Patients with type 2 diabetes, established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and eGFR ≥ 30 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 at screening were randomized to receive empagliflozin 10 mg, empagliflozin 25 mg, or placebo once daily in addition to standard of care. Post hoc, we analyzed cardiovascular and kidney outcomes, and safety, using the two-dimensional KDIGO classification framework.

Results

Of 6952 patients with baseline eGFR and urinary albumin-creatinine ratio values, 47%, 29%, 15%, and 8% were classified into low, moderately increased, high, and very high KDIGO risk categories, respectively. Empagliflozin showed consistent risk reductions across KDIGO categories for cardiovascular outcomes (P values for treatment by subgroup interactions ranged from 0.26 to 0.85) and kidney outcomes (P values for treatment by subgroup interactions ranged from 0.16 to 0.60). In all KDIGO risk categories, placebo and empagliflozin had similar adverse event rates, the notable exception being genital infection events, which were more common with empagliflozin for each category.

Conclusions

The observed effects of empagliflozin versus placebo on cardiovascular and kidney outcomes were consistent across the KDIGO risk categories, indicating that the effect of treatment benefit of empagliflozin was unaffected by baseline CKD status.

### Empagliflozin in patients with chronic kidney disease [^116P9R89]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Background

The effects of empagliflozin in patients with chronic kidney disease who are at risk for disease progression are not well understood. The EMPA-KIDNEY trial was designed to assess the effects of treatment with empagliflozin in a broad range of such patients.

Methods

We enrolled patients with chronic kidney disease who had an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of at least 20 but less than 45 mL per minute per 1.73 m² of body-surface area, or who had an eGFR of at least 45 but less than 90 mL per minute per 1.73 m 2 with a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (with albumin measured in milligrams and creatinine measured in grams) of at least 200. Patients were randomly assigned to receive empagliflozin (10 mg once daily) or matching placebo. The primary outcome was a composite of progression of kidney disease (defined as end-stage kidney disease, a sustained decrease in eGFR to < 10 mL per minute per 1.73 m 2, a sustained decrease in eGFR of ≥ 40% from baseline, or death from renal causes) or death from cardiovascular causes.

Results

A total of 6609 patients underwent randomization. During a median of 2.0 years of follow-up, progression of kidney disease or death from cardiovascular causes occurred in 432 of 3304 patients (13.1%) in the empagliflozin group and in 558 of 3305 patients (16.9%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.72; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.64 to 0.82; P < 0.001). Results were consistent among patients with or without diabetes and across subgroups defined according to eGFR ranges. The rate of hospitalization from any cause was lower in the empagliflozin group than in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.78 to 0.95; P = 0.003), but there were no significant between-group differences with respect to the composite outcome of hospitalization for heart failure or death from cardiovascular causes (which occurred in 4.0% in the empagliflozin group and 4.6% in the placebo group) or death from any cause (in 4.5% and 5.1%, respectively). The rates of serious adverse events were similar in the two groups.

Conclusions

Among a wide range of patients with chronic kidney disease who were at risk for disease progression, empagliflozin therapy led to a lower risk of progression of kidney disease or death from cardiovascular causes than placebo.

### Albuminuria-lowering effect of adding semaglutide on top of empagliflozin in individuals with type 2 diabetes: a randomized and placebo-controlled study [^113CZDhY]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Aim

To investigate whether combined treatment with empagliflozin (a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor) and semaglutide (a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist) can reduce urinary albumin-creatinine ratio (UACR) compared to treatment with empagliflozin alone in individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and albuminuria.

Methods

We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel study including 60 individuals with T2D and albuminuria. All participants initiated open-label empagliflozin 25 mg once daily, on top of renin-angiotensin system inhibition, in a run-in period of 26weeks. Subsequently, participants were randomized to semaglutide or placebo 1 mg once weekly for 26weeks. The primary endpoint was change in UACR. Secondary endpoints were change in: (i) measured glomerular filtration rate (GFR); (ii) 24-hour systolic blood pressure; (iii) glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) level; (iv) body weight; and (v) plasma renin and aldosterone levels.

Results

Addition of semaglutide to empagliflozin provided no additional change in UACR from randomization to end-of-treatment. The mean (95% confidence interval) difference in UACR was -22 (-44; 10)% (P = 0.15) between treatment groups. Neither GFR, 24-hour blood pressure, body weight, nor plasma renin activity was changed with semaglutide. HbA1c (-8 [-13; -3] mmol/mol; P = 0.003) and plasma aldosterone (-30 [-50; -3] pmol/L; P = 0.035) were reduced with semaglutide compared to placebo.

Conclusions

Semaglutide added to empagliflozin did not change UACR, measured GFR, 24-hour systolic blood pressure, body weight or plasma renin levels in individuals with T2D and albuminuria. Semaglutide improved glycaemic control and plasma aldosterone levels compared to placebo.

### KDOQI US commentary on the KDIGO 2020 clinical practice guideline for diabetes management in CKD [^1158cmfL]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Estimated glomerular filtration rate thresholds for SGLT2 inhibitor use — initiation, continuation, and trial enrollment: The guideline specifies a lower limit eGFR of 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 for initiation of SGLT2 inhibitor, but maintains that it is safe to continue until reaching the need for KRT. DAPA-CKD and EMPEROR enrolled patients down to an eGFR of 25 and 20 mL/ min/1.73 m2, respectively. EMPA-KIDNEY (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT03594110) is enrolling patients down to an eGFR of 20 mL/min/1.73 m2. It may be appropriate in patients with uACR > 1,000 mg/g who are at high risk for rapid decline in eGFR or have a history of rapid eGFR decline to initiate an SGLT2 inhibitor at an eGFR of 25 mL/min/1.73 m2, as the DAPA-CKD trial is directly applicable to patients with CKD.

### How do SGLT2 inhibitors protect the kidney? A mediation analysis of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial [^112X1YWA]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Mechanisms underlying kidney benefits with sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibition in heart failure and/or type 2 diabetes (T2D) with established cardiovascular disease are currently unclear.

Methods

We evaluated post hoc the factors mediating the effect of empagliflozin on a composite kidney outcome (first sustained estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥ 40% reduction from baseline, initiation of renal replacement therapy or death due to kidney disease) in EMPA-REG OUTCOME (Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients). Variables, calculated as change from baseline or updated mean, were evaluated as time-dependent covariates and using a landmark approach (at Week 12) in Cox regression analyses. In multivariable analyses, variables with the greatest mediating effect were added using a step-up procedure.

Results

In univariable time-dependent updated mean covariate analyses, the strongest mediator was hematocrit (99.5% mediation). Hemoglobin, uric acid and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio mediated 79.4%, 33.2% and 31.0%, respectively. Multivariable analyses were not performed due to the very strong mediation effect of hematocrit. In univariable Week 12 landmark change from baseline analyses, the strongest mediators included hematocrit (40.7%), glycated hemoglobin (28.3%), systolic blood pressure (16.8%) and free fatty acids (16.5%), which yielded a combined mediation of 78.9% in multivariable analysis.

Conclusions

Changes in hematocrit and hemoglobin were the strongest mediators of empagliflozin's kidney benefits in EMPA-REG OUTCOME participants with T2D and cardiovascular disease.

### Practical approach to initiating SGLT2 inhibitors in type 2 diabetes [^115BMY1U]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Clinical Efficacy

In randomized phase 2 and 3 clinical trials, the use of SGLT2 inhibitors as monotherapy (only indicated when intolerance to metformin or side effects exist) has been shown to significantly improve glycemic control in patients with T2DM. A systematic review of 45 randomized clinical studies comparing SGLT2 inhibitors to placebo (11,232 patients implicated) and 13 studies comparing SGLT2 inhibitors to active comparators (5175 patients using metformin, sitagliptin, or sulfonylurea) reported a reduction in HbA1c of −0.66% (95% confidence interval (CI) −0.73% to −0.58%) compared with placebo and −0.06% (95% CI −0.18% to 0.05%) with respect to active comparators. Greater HbA1c reductions (0.44%, 0.54%, and 1.01%) have been observed in patients with high baseline HbA1c levels, i.e. HbA1c less than 8.0% (64 mmol/mol), HbA1c = 8.0–9.0% (64–75 mmol/mol), and HbA1c greater than 9.0% (75 mmol/mol), respectively. In addition, SGLT2 inhibitor therapy as monotherapy or in combination with metformin has been described to induce stable weight loss. In a systematic review, in comparison with other agents, SGLT2 inhibitors reduced mean body weight by −1.80 kg (95% CI −3.50 to −0.11 kg). In this vein, SGLT2 inhibitors have also been associated with a reduced systolic blood pressure of −4.45 mmHg (95% CI −5.73 to −3.18 mmHg) from baseline. A meta-analysis involving 27 randomized clinical trials and 12,960 individuals (follow-up period ranging from 4 to 52 weeks) recently demonstrated that SGLT2 inhibitors achieve a reduction of systolic and diastolic blood pressure of −4.0 and −1.6 mmHg, respectively. Finally, the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial, which aimed to evaluate long-term effects of empagliflozin on renal and cardiovascular outcomes in T2DM patients (3.1 years of median follow-up period), has demonstrated that, in addition to standard care, empagliflozin reduced the rate of incident or worsening nephropathy (approximately 39% reduction), serum creatinine doubling (44%), initiation of renal replacement therapy (55%), the risk of death from cardiovascular disease (38%), hospitalization for heart failure (35%), and all-cause death (32%) in patients with T2DM and high cardiovascular risk. Separation of event curves started very early in the study and is a matter of debate. The mechanisms involved in cardiovascular and renal benefits of empagliflozin are multifactorial. Hemodynamic effects, specifically reduced blood pressure and extracellular volume, driven by the direct drug class mechanism of action (osmotic diuresis), seems to be the main explanation for such a rapid effect, especially applied to the reduction in cardiovascular mortality and heart failure-related events. Many other factors including changes in weight, cardiac function, and metabolic actions could also be implied. A possible class effect should be confirmed in upcoming cardiovascular outcomes trials using other SGLT2 inhibitors.

### Design, recruitment, and baseline characteristics of the EMPA-KIDNEY trial [^1128WzLB]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

EMPA-KIDNEY's primary outcome incorporates a ≥ 40% decline in eGFR from the randomization value in the trial definition of kidney disease progression, compared with the larger ≥ 50% decline in eGFR pre-specified by DAPA-CKD and doubling of creatinine (effectively a ≥ 57% decline in eGFR) utilized in CREDENCE. EMPA-KIDNEY employed such a definition as it aimed to recruit a large proportion of people with low levels of albuminuria and without DM who are predicted to progress more slowly than people with albuminuric diabetic CKD. Smaller percentage declines in eGFR ensure such people contribute to the primary outcome. However, when testing interventions, which can cause an acute initial decline in eGFR (such as SGLT-2 inhibitors), smaller percentage declines in eGFR may be a less specific surrogate of progression to ESKD than large percentage declines. The EMPA-KIDNEY DAP has therefore pre-specified exploratory analyses of the effects of empagliflozin versus placebo on a composite of kidney disease progression or cardiovascular death using alternative eGFR thresholds, thereby allowing some harmonization across the three trials.

Sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) for kidney protection in T2D — An SGLT2i with proven kidney protection is recommended for people with T2D who have an eGFR ≥ 25 mL/min/1.73 m2; in those with HF, empagliflozin can be used with an eGFR as low as 20 mL/min/1.73 m2, and if eGFR drops below this level on treatment, the SGLT2i does not have to be stopped unless kidney replacement therapy is required. Recognized side effects are not greater at lower eGFR, initial reports of higher rates of lower extremity amputation with canagliflozin have not been substantiated, SGLT2is tend to lower serum potassium, and the risk of AKI is actually reduced by 25% with SGLT2i use in persons with T2D.

### Effects of empagliflozin on conventional and exploratory acute and chronic kidney outcomes: an individual participant-level meta-analysis [^114s7GMb]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

Background

Uncertainty remains about effects of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibition on kidney outcomes in individuals with slowly progressive chronic kidney disease (eg, low albuminuria) and those at risk of large acute estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) dips on initiation of such treatment. We aimed to explore the effects of empagliflozin on a range of kidney outcomes in these population subtypes.

Methods

In this meta-analysis, we used individual-level data from 23340 participants in four large placebo-controlled trials (EMPA-REG OUTCOME, EMPEROR-Reduced, EMPEROR-Preserved, and EMPA-KIDNEY) to assess the effects of empagliflozin on conventional and exploratory acute and chronic kidney outcomes. We then assessed whether effects varied by predicted size of the acute eGFR dip on treatment initiation or among other key population subtypes using tests for heterogeneity and trend. The individual-level data were requested from Boehringer Ingelheim (Ingelheim, Germany).

Findings

Compared with placebo, allocation to empagliflozin reduced the risk of a marker of acute kidney injury (a ≥ 50% increase in serum creatinine in consecutive follow-up samples) by 20% (hazard ratio 0.80 [95% CI 0.72–0.88]; 1573 outcomes), acute kidney injury adverse events by 27% (0.73 [0.63–0.85]; 694 outcomes), a categorical chronic kidney disease progression outcome by 30% (0.70 [0.63–0.78]; 1403 outcomes), and kidney failure by 34% (0.66 [0.55–0.79]; 490 outcomes). Empagliflozin slowed a chronic annual rate of eGFR decline by 64% (95% CI 59–69) and off-treatment dip-free slope-a post-hoc outcome using randomisation and off-treatment eGFR values available in a subset of 10630 participants-by 64% (54–73). These kidney benefits were similar in subgroups divided by predicted size of acute eGFR dip, and were present irrespective of diabetes or heart failure status, level of kidney function, or albuminuria.

Interpretation

SGLT2 inhibition reduces risk of acute and chronic kidney outcomes irrespective of the size of the acute dip in eGFR. Kidney benefits are evident irrespective of diabetes status, heart failure status, primary cause of kidney disease, and markers of severity of these diseases.

### Association of empagliflozin treatment with albuminuria levels in patients with heart failure: a secondary analysis of EMPEROR-pooled [^114rDxbL]. JAMA Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is empagliflozin associated with a reduction in albuminuria in patients with heart failure?

Findings

In this secondary analysis from EMPEROR-Pooled, treatment with empagliflozin was associated with a reduction in incidence of new macroalbuminuria and an increase in rate of remission to sustained normoalbuminuria or microalbuminuria among patients with macroalbuminuria at baseline. The association of empagliflozin with cardiovascular and kidney outcomes was consistent across albumin-to-creatinine ratio categories.

Meaning

Compared with placebo, empagliflozin was associated with a reduction in progression to macroalbuminuria and a reversion from macroalbuminuria as well as a decrease in heart failure hospitalizations or cardiovascular death, irrespective of baseline albuminuria.

### Renoprotective effects of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors [^112a9K3P]. Kidney International (2018). Low credibility.

Over the past two years, our understanding of anti-hyperglycemic medications used to treat patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) has fundamentally changed. Before the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial, agents used to lower blood glucose were felt to prevent or delay the development of microvascular complications, but were not known to definitively reduce cardiovascular risk or mortality. Previous studies with then novel sodium-glucose cotransport-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors demonstrated improvements in several cardiovascular and renal risk factors, including HbA1c, blood pressure, weight, renal hyperfiltration, and albuminuria. However, as with other antihyperglycemic drugs, it could not be known if these salutary effects would translate into improved cardiorenal outcomes. In the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial, SGLT2 inhibition with empagliflozin reduced the primary outcome of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), while also reducing mortality, hospitalization for heart failure, and progression of diabetic kidney disease. In the CANVAS Program trials using canagliflozin, the rates of the 3-point MACE endpoint, the risk of heart failure and the renal composite endpoint were also reduced, albeit with an increased risk of lower extremity amputation and fracture. As a result, clinical practice guidelines recommend the consideration of SGLT2 inhibition in high-risk patient subgroups for cardiovascular risk reduction. Ongoing primary renal endpoint trials will inform the cardio-metabolic-renal community about how to optimally treat patients with chronic kidney disease - including those with and without diabetes. Our aim is to review the rationale for renal protection with SGLT2 inhibitors, and their current place in the clinical management of patients with kidney disease.

### Empagliflozin: role in treatment options for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^112rfXpq]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

The reduction in the risk of hospitalization for heart failure was also striking, with subgroup analysis showing consistent results in patients with or without heart failure at baseline. Patients with diabetes and heart failure have a particularly poor prognosis; thus, while the results seen with empagliflozin are still to be confirmed by independent studies, they are very promising. Even in patients without diabetes, heart failure is a challenging condition to treat, and it has been reported that empagliflozin will be studied in patients with heart failure, both with and without T2DM.

During the trial, renal outcomes were also studied. Patients in the pooled empagliflozin groups had a significantly lower risk of renal disease progression as related to various predefined endpoints, including incident or worsening nephropathy, defined as progression to macroalbuminuria (urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio > 300 mg/g), which occurred in 12.7% of the empagliflozin group versus 18.8% of the placebo group (HR 0.61; 95% CI: 0.53–0.70; P < 0.001). The empagliflozin group also had a significantly lower risk of starting renal replacement therapy, which was recorded in 1.0% of the empagliflozin group versus 2.1% of the placebo group (HR 0.45; 95% CI: 0.21–0.97; P = 0.04). Empagliflozin appeared to have no effect on the risk of developing albuminuria in patients with normal albumin levels at baseline (HR 0.95; 95% CI: 0.87–1.04; P = 0.25), although the risk of progression to macroalbuminuria in the overall group was significantly reduced (HR 0.62; 95% CI: 0.54–0.72; P < 0.001). Empagliflozin also appeared to protect renal function as measured by eGFR — after an initial dip in eGFR during the first few weeks of treatment, eGFR stabilized in the empagliflozin group and in fact returned to baseline values after stopping treatment. Because eGFR in the placebo group declined over time, following the natural progression expected, there were significant differences between the empagliflozin and placebo groups by the study end. It is worth remembering that these renal effects of empagliflozin were seen in addition to standard of care: most patients in the trial were on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers (80.7% at baseline). When looking at adverse events, events that were consistent with acute renal failure, including acute kidney injury, and hyperkalemia were reported in a lower proportion of the empagliflozin group than the placebo group.

Introduction

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is frequently associated with comorbidities that exacerbate cardiovascular (CV) risk, such as obesity and hypertension. The risk of CV disease is increased approximately two to four-fold in adults with diabetes even after adjustment for conventional risk factors (age, sex, smoking status, body mass index [BMI], systolic blood pressure [BP], and lipids). Recommended strategies for reducing CV risk in patients with T2DM include glucose management, lipid lowering, BP control, smoking cessation, and weight loss. Improved glycemic control has been associated with a reduction in microvascular events and there is a clear association between microvascular complications such as albuminuria and an increased risk of CV events in patients with T2DM. However, the impact of reducing blood glucose, and the potential benefit of specific glucose-lowering agents, on CV events in patients with T2DM remains unclear and highly controversial. Moreover, treatment must likely occur over a substantial duration of time, since macrovascular outcome events are known to be late complications of a progressive multifaceted pathogenic process that spans decades. Lately, regulatory authorities have issued guidance for evaluating the long-term CV safety of new anti-diabetes agents to ensure that CV safety is demonstrated with reasonable assurance. These mandated trials provide an opportunity to potentially demonstrate CV as well as microvascular benefits of new anti-diabetes drugs.

Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are a new class of antidiabetes agents that reduce hyperglycemia in patients with T2DM by reducing renal glucose reabsorption and thus increasing urinary glucose excretion (UGE). Empagliflozin is a potent and selective inhibitor of SGLT2. In placebo-controlled phase III trials in patients with T2DM, empagliflozin used as monotherapy or add-on therapy improved hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) approximately 0.7–1.0% -point (depending on baseline HbA1c and renal function) with a low risk of hypoglycemia, reduced body weight and BP, without increases in heart rate, and had small effects on plasma lipids (increase in HDL-cholesterol, increase in LDL-cholesterol, no change in LDL/HDL cholesterol ratio). In addition, empagliflozin has been shown to improve arterial stiffness and reduce glomerular hyperfiltration in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Moreover, SGLT2 inhibitors have also been reported to reduce other CV risk markers such as visceral fat mass and proteinuria. Based on these pleiotropic effects on CV risk factors, we hypothesized that empagliflozin may reduce CV risk in patients with T2DM.

### SGLT2 inhibitors in CKD: are they really effective in all patients? [^112yFMZC]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

The Canagliflozin Cardiovascular Assessment Study (CANVAS) and Canagliflozin and Renal Events in Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation (CREDENCE) trials reported benefits for patients with BMI below 25; however, all participants in these studies were diabetic, further limiting their relevance to non-diabetic populations. In contrast, the DIAMOND trial, which specifically evaluated dapagliflozin in non-diabetic CKD patients, found no significant effect on proteinuria in a cohort with a mean BMI of 28 and eGFR of 58.2 mL/min. Notably, a study investigating SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with glomerulonephritis observed a significant reduction in proteinuria, but the effect was more pronounced in individuals with higher BMI, suggesting that the antiproteinuric efficacy of SGLT2 inhibitors may be enhanced in overweight and obese patients, likely due to the fluid retention often seen in this population. Similarly, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction trials also demonstrated renal benefits from SGLT2 inhibitors in non-diabetic CKD patients. However, these studies focused on individuals with ejection fractions below 40% — a population marked by sodium retention and fluid overload. These findings are less likely to extend to CKD patients without hyperfiltration-related comorbidities, such as younger, leaner individuals with early-stage disease.

### Effects of empagliflozin on progression of chronic kidney disease: a prespecified secondary analysis from the empa-kidney trial [^116vHUAM]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is common and associated with reduced quality of life and increased risks of kidney failure (which is fatal without costly kidney replacement therapy), cardiovascular disease and mortality. – Trials in CKD populations have traditionally used dichotomous composite clinical outcomes which combine kidney failure (an infrequent outcome) with a proportional reduction in kidney function (as measured by change in estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]) from baseline in excess of a particular threshold, usually 40% to 57%. The latter component is now accepted by regulatory authorities as a valid surrogate outcome for kidney failure itself in randomized trials. Like all dichotomous outcomes, the majority of such outcomes during the trial follow-up period occurs in patients at highest risk, unlike in the general population where the majority of events occur during the lifetime of patients at moderate risk because of the much larger number of such patients. Therefore analyses based on these outcomes have less statistical sensitivity for determining the effects of treatment among groups of patients who are at lower risk of kidney failure (including those with better preserved kidney function) but from whom ultimately come the majority of patients with kidney failure in the general population. There is therefore interest in examining the annualised rate of decline of kidney function ("eGFR slope") because this parameter can be calculated for all participants, and so eGFR slopes have improved statistical sensitivity when comparing the effect of an intervention in different types of patient. It may also be considered as a valid surrogate of CKD progression per se and be used as a primary outcome in trials. Importantly, the effect of a treatment on eGFR slope is not necessarily homogeneous over time; many renoprotective treatments including renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors, sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) and finerenone, cause an early 'acute' negative effect on slope (referred to as an acute dip), followed by a long-term (or 'chronic') reduction in eGFR slope. It is therefore important to understand the effects of new treatments on these two components of the 'total' slope.

### Canagliflozin for the treatment of diabetic kidney disease and implications for clinical practice: a narrative review [^111YCT2n]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Renal outcomes data for people with DKD are not yet available for other SGLT2 inhibitors; however, trials for the SGLT2 inhibitors dapagliflozin and empagliflozin that include this population as well as people with CKD (without T2DM) are ongoing and expected to be completed in late 2020 and 2022, respectively. These data may help to clarify whether the renal benefits seen with canagliflozin in CREDENCE trial participants are a class effect of SGLT2 inhibitors and whether these effects may extend to people with CKD who do not have T2DM to further establish the renal efficacy and safety of this class of drugs.

The results from the CREDENCE trial prompted the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to expand the indication for canagliflozin to a new patient population. Prior to CREDENCE, canagliflozin was approved for two indications: (1) as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with T2DM and (2) to reduce the risk of MACE in adults with T2DM and established cardiovascular disease. On the basis of results from the CREDENCE trial, the FDA approved canagliflozin to reduce the risk of ESKD, doubling of serum creatinine, cardiovascular death, and hospitalization for heart failure in adults with T2DM and diabetic nephropathy with albuminuria (> 300 mg/day). The US prescribing information for canagliflozin was also updated to allow the continuation of canagliflozin 100 mg in people already receiving therapy whose eGFR falls to < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 with a UACR > 300 mg/g until initiation of dialysis or kidney transplantation. Evidence from the CREDENCE trial also prompted the American Diabetes Association to update its guidelines in June 2019 to recommend that people with T2DM with an eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and albuminuria (> 300 mg/g) consider using an SGLT2 inhibitor to reduce their risk of DKD progression and/or cardiovascular events. Further updates to these guidelines published in 2020 suggested that SGLT2 inhibitors should be considered independently of HbA1c for people when atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure, or CKD predominates or for people with T2DM and CKD who require treatment in addition to metformin to attain target HbA1c. Taken together, these new recommendations demonstrate that canagliflozin treatment is beneficial to a diverse array of people in a broad range of circumstances, and physicians should consider the unique characteristics of each patient when determining if canagliflozin is an appropriate treatment option (Fig. 8).

### Nephrotic-range proteinuria in type 2 diabetes: effects of empagliflozin on kidney disease progression and clinical outcomes [^1136UFpK]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Diabetic kidney disease with nephrotic-range proteinuria (NRP) is commonly associated with rapid kidney function loss, increased cardiovascular risk, and premature mortality. We explored the effect of empagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, complicated by presence of this major risk factor for progressive kidney disease, in a post-hoc analysis of data from the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial (NCT01131676).

Methods

Cox proportional hazards models were used to investigate the risk of cardiovascular and kidney outcomes in participants with and without NRP, defined by urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) ≥ 2200 mg/g at baseline. Annual loss of eGFR during chronic treatment (eGFR slopes) and hypothetical time to projected end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), conditioning upon linearity of eGFR change over time if a patient did not decease before projected ESKD, were calculated using a random-intercept random-coefficient model. Safety was described based on investigator-reported adverse events.

Findings

112 participants (pooled empagliflozin, n = 70; placebo, n = 42; median on-treatment follow-up of 1.9 years on placebo compared with 2.3 years on empagliflozin) presented with NRP at baseline; eGFR and UACR were balanced between treatments. Empagliflozin benefits on cardiovascular death, hospitalisation for heart failure, or kidney outcomes, were consistent in participants with and without NRP (p interaction > 0.1). Treatment effects of empagliflozin on adjusted annual mean eGFR slope were more pronounced in participants with NRP versus those without (p interaction 0.005). Empagliflozin was estimated to double the median hypothetical time to projected ESKD in participants with NRP. The overall safety profile of empagliflozin was comparable between participants with and without NRP at baseline.

Interpretation

Our data suggests that empagliflozin might slow kidney function loss and delay the estimated onset of projected ESKD in patients with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease complicated by NRP.

### Design, recruitment, and baseline characteristics of the EMPA-KIDNEY trial [^113ocXwX]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

The EMPA-KIDNEY trial is assessing the efficacy and safety of adding empagliflozin 10 mg to the standard of care in 6609 people with CKD using a streamlined design. Its pre-screening process was relatively novel for renal trials and had multiple benefits. Advantages included a semiquantitative assessment of feasibility at each prospective site, which provided early confirmation that recruitment of 6000 participants from only eight countries was possible, and decreased the likelihood of screening failures. The trial's simple eligibility criteria are intended to maximize its generalizability and led to randomization of a wide range of people with CKD at risk of progression. At recruitment, slightly more than half of participants did not have DM, about three-quarters had an eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and about half had levels of albuminuria < 300 mg/g.

The wide range of people with CKD randomized into EMPA-KIDNEY included groups excluded from or under-represented in the other SGLT-2 inhibitor trials with a primary focus on kidney disease progression. For example, only 31% (2057/6609) of EMPA-KIDNEY participants have a local investigator-ascribed primary renal diagnosis of diabetic kidney disease, compared with 58% (2510/4304) in DAPA-CKD and all of the 4401 CREDENCE participants (Table 2). The DAPA-CKD results on non-diabetic kidney disease are based on 128 primary outcomes in 1398 participants. The larger number of people without DM in EMPA-KIDNEY will provide valuable additional information on the effects of empagliflozin on cardiorenal outcomes in people without DM. We predict that ∼40–50% of primary outcomes in EMPA-KIDNEY will be among people without DM at randomization. In particular, EMPA-KIDNEY has recruited 1669 people with glomerular disease, of which 817 (49%) had IgA nephropathy and 195 (12%) had focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (90% of whom reported a kidney biopsy).

### Effects of empagliflozin on progression of chronic kidney disease: a prespecified secondary analysis from the empa-kidney trial [^115e4SnC]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

Randomized trials of SGLT2i have consistently shown that this class of treatment reduces the risk of progression of kidney disease (measured with dichotomous outcomes) in patients with CKD with or without diabetes, irrespective of underlying primary kidney disease. – Secondary analyses of two previous trials of SGLT2i in CKD populations found some evidence that the effects of SGLT2i on eGFR slope varied in different types of patient, but because the trials only recruited patients with significant albuminuria, they were limited in their ability to explore whether this effect varied according to baseline albuminuria as well as other clinical characteristics. Here we present the effects of empagliflozin versus placebo on eGFR slope from the EMPA-KIDNEY trial which recruited a uniquely broad range of patients with CKD at risk of progression, including those with minimal albuminuria, low eGFR, and with and without diabetes.

### Long-term effects of empagliflozin in patients with chronic kidney disease [^114oECkB]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

The study EMPA-KIDNEY (long-term follow-up) was published by EMPA-KIDNEY Collaborative Group and colleagues in 2025 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Chronic kidney disease. In the EMPA-KIDNEY (long-term follow-up) study, the trial question was: what are the long-term effects of empagliflozin in patients with CKD at risk for progression? In the EMPA-KIDNEY (long-term follow-up) study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the EMPA-KIDNEY (long-term follow-up) study, the population was: 4891 patients (1664 female, 3227 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with CKD at risk for progression. The key exclusion criteria were polycystic kidney disease; previous or scheduled bariatric surgery; ketoacidosis in the past 5 years; symptomatic hypotension; hypersensitivity to empagliflozin; intravenous immunosuppressive therapy in the last 3 months; T1DM. In the EMPA-KIDNEY (long-term follow-up) study, the interventions were: n = 2472 empagliflozin (at a dose of 10 mg once daily in active trial period; in post-trial period, no trial empagliflozin administration, but prescription of open-label SGLT inhibitors including open-label empagliflozin allowed) n = 2419 placebo (matching placebo once daily in active trial period; in post-trial period, no trial placebo administration, but prescription of open-label SGLT inhibitors including open-label empagliflozin allowed). In the EMPA-KIDNEY (long-term follow-up) study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in kidney disease progression or cardiovascular death (26.2% vs. 30.3%; HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.87). In the EMPA-KIDNEY (long-term follow-up) study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in kidney disease progression (23.5% vs. 27.1%; HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.87) Significant decrease in death from any cause or ESRD (16.9% vs. 19.6%; HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.9) Significant decrease in ESRD (9% vs. 11.3%; HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.87). In the EMPA-KIDNEY (long-term follow-up) study, the conclusion was: in patients with CKD at risk for progression, empagliflozin was superior to placebo with respect to kidney disease progression or cardiovascular death.

### Empagliflozin: role in treatment options for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^113e4RvD]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Empagliflozin is an oral treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), one of the leading causes of death in the US and around the world. Recently, the EMPA-REG OUTCOME study has shown that empagliflozin added to standard of care treatment reduced the risk of cardiovascular (CV) events in patients with T2DM who were also at increased CV risk. The risk of major adverse CV events (MACE: first occurrence of CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or non-fatal stroke) was reduced by 14% relative to placebo (HR 0.86; 95.02% CI: 0.74–0.99; P = 0.04 for superiority). The risk of CV death was reduced by 38% relative to the placebo group (HR 0.62; 95% CI: 0.49–0.77; P < 0.001) and the risk of death from any cause by 32% (HR 0.68; 95% CI: 0.57–0.82; P < 0.001). Furthermore, empagliflozin was associated with reduced risk of hospitalization for heart failure and of renal adverse events. As well as EMPA-REG OUTCOME, empagliflozin has been studied in a number of clinical trials in patients with T2DM, in various combinations, including with insulin. Empagliflozin has shown significant improvements in glycemic control, body weight, and blood pressure, albeit improvements are limited in patients with declining renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate < 45 ml/min/1.73 m²). Empagliflozin has been generally well tolerated, with the typical adverse events of genital mycotic infections usually being straightforward to manage. Considering all the data together, empagliflozin appears to be a promising option for many patients with T2DM, but care will still be needed to ensure that use is appropriate for an individual patient's characteristics.

### Empagliflozin and kidney function decline in patients with type 2 diabetes: a slope analysis from the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial [^112wnFUT]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Empagliflozin slowed the progression of CKD in patients with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME Trial. In a prespecified statistical approach, we assessed treatment differences in kidney function by analyzing slopes of eGFR changes.

Methods

Participants (n = 7020) were randomized (1:1:1) to empagliflozin 10 mg/d, empagliflozin 25 mg/d, or placebo added to standard of care. We calculated eGFR slopes using random-intercept/random-coefficient models for prespecified study periods: treatment initiation (baseline to week 4), chronic maintenance treatment (week 4 to last value on treatment), and post-treatment (last value on treatment to follow-up).

Results

Compared with placebo, empagliflozin was associated with uniform shifts in individual eGFR slopes across all periods. On treatment initiation, adjusted mean slope (eGFR change per week, ml/min per 1.73 m 2) decreased with empagliflozin (-0.77; 95% confidence interval, -0.83 to -0.71; placebo: 0.01; 95% confidence interval, -0.08 to 0.10; P < 0.001). However, annual mean slope (ml/min per 1.73 m² per year) did not decline with empagliflozin during chronic treatment (empagliflozin: 0.23; 95% confidence interval, 0.05 to 0.40; placebo: -1.46; 95% confidence interval, -1.74 to -1.17; P < 0.001). After drug cessation, the adjusted mean eGFR slope (ml/min per 1.73 m 2 per week) increased and mean eGFR returned toward baseline level only in the empagliflozin group (0.56; 95% confidence interval, 0.49 to 0.62; placebo -0.02; 95% confidence interval, -0.12 to 0.08; P < 0.001). Results were consistent across patient subgroups at higher CKD risk.

Conclusions

The hemodynamic effects of empagliflozin, associated with reduction in intraglomerular pressure, may contribute to long-term preservation of kidney function.

### Mechanisms of diabetic kidney disease and established and emerging treatments [^115ZjsRV]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

Kidney disease is the leading cause of mortality in persons with diabetes mellitus. Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) typically presents with a reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate and, in many but not all cases, with marked proteinuria. Strict glycaemic control and blood pressure control remain foundational in managing DKD, and advances in the understanding of disease mechanisms have redefined the therapeutic landscape. Large outcome trials, such as EMPA-KIDNEY, DAPA-CKD and CREDENCE, have demonstrated that sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors slow chronic kidney disease progression and improve cardiovascular outcomes. Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists reduce albuminuria and preserve estimated glomerular filtration rate, as shown most recently in the FLOW trial. Finerenone, a non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, lowered renal and cardiovascular risk in the FIDELIO-DKD and FIGARO-DKD trials. Combination approaches (for example, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibition plus endothelin receptor type A blockade in ZENITH-CKD), aldosterone synthase inhibition, and targeted anti-inflammatory or complement-modifying agents offer additional promise. We summarize the key pathophysiological drivers (glomerular hyperfiltration, podocyte injury, tubulointerstitial inflammation and fibrosis), review established treatments and highlight emerging strategies to prevent or halt DKD.

### KDOQI US commentary on the KDIGO 2020 clinical practice guideline for diabetes management in CKD [^111Z7hMf]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Albuminuria and SGLT2 inhibitors — albuminuria is not required for recommendation, and benefits span albuminuria strata: KDIGO does not recommend albuminuria as a criterion in their recommendation for use of SGLT2 inhibitors in type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD); in SGLT2 inhibitor cardiovascular outcome trials, roughly half of participants had normoalbuminuria and another 30% had moderate albuminuria. In a CANVAS-R post hoc eGFR slope analysis stratified by albuminuria, the severe group had the greatest numeric reduction (3.0 [95% CI, 2.0–4.0] mL/min/1.73 m2 per year), with statistically significant reductions also in the moderate and mild groups (1.0 [95% CI, 0.6–1.4] and 1.0 [95% CI, 0.9–1.3] mL/min/1.73 m2 per year, respectively). Post hoc analyses of EMPA-REG and CANVAS stratified by KDIGO CKD risk categories report that while absolute risk reductions were greater for higher risk categories, the relative risk reductions were similar across categories, and even participants in the low-risk category (eGFR ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73 m2 and uACR < 30 mg/g) experienced a decreased risk for incident or worsening nephropathy and the composite end point.

Treatments for CKD in People Living with T2DM

Findings from systematic reviews and meta-analyses indicate that improved renal outcomes can be achieved through obesity management, intensive glycemic control using glucose-lowering medications, and anti-hypertension drugs. A caveat of using these medications is that many have reduced renal clearance due to declining kidney function or are contraindicated and often require careful dose adjustments. Furthermore, several of these therapies have only a modest glucose-lowering effect in people with reduced glomerular filtration. For these reasons, limited treatment options exist for this patient population.

Both the American Diabetes Association (ADA), in conjunction with the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD), and KDIGO provide clinical practice guidelines for diabetes management in CKD. These guidelines recommend a comprehensive strategy be followed to reduce risks of CKD in people living with T2DM and are summarized in Fig. 2. In the Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes — 2021, the ADA recommend that for people with indications of high risk or established CKD either a sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) or a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) be considered as a treatment option, independently of metformin use. Guidelines provided by KDIGO similarly recommend SGLT2i for people with an eGFR of ≥ 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2 due to the vascular and renal benefit, despite its modest effect on glucose control. The current KDIGO guidelines do not recommend SGLT2i for people in more advanced stages of CKD (eGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2), as the efficacy for lowering glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) is blunted. This is indicated in the label information for empagliflozin and canagliflozin, with both of these SGLT2i not recommended for individuals with an eGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2. For dapagliflozin, recently updated prescribing information indicates that initiation of treatment with this SGLT2i is not recommended in individuals with an eGFR < 25 ml/min/1.73 m 2. In people with T2DM and CKD, who have not achieved individualized glycemic targets despite use of metformin and SGLT2i, or are unable to use those medications due to contraindications, long-acting GLP-1 RAs are recommended. The use of GLP-1 RAs in this population is not only due to the limited use of SLGT2i in more severe stages but also because the glycemic lowering efficacy of SLGT2i is reduced in individuals with moderate renal impairment and likely absent in those with severe renal impairment. These anti-hyperglycemic therapies have shown promise in directly improving renal outcomes and reducing CKD progression independently of glycemic control. The use of GLP-1 RAs is also associated with a low risk for hypoglycemia, which is a limiting factor for many other diabetes medications in people with renal impairment.

The results of this post-hoc analysis of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial corroborate the hypothesis that empagliflozin could offer a safe and effective treatment option to slow kidney disease progression and improve clinical outcomes in a population of patients with T2DM who are at very high risk for rapid loss of kidney function due to residual NRP despite optimised conservative treatment. These findings need confirmation in other trials, including the ongoing randomised EMPA-KIDNEY (NCT03594110) trial on treatment effects of empagliflozin in adults with and without diabetes but with CKD at more advanced stages.

### Comparative effectiveness of the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor empagliflozin versus other antihyperglycemics on risk of major adverse kidney events [^112XM4J8]. Diabetes Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To examine the comparative effectiveness of the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) empagliflozin and other non-SGLT2i antihyperglycemics on the risk of major adverse kidney events (MAKE) of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decline > 50%, end-stage kidney disease, or all-cause mortality.

Research Design and Methods

In a cohort study of 379,033 new users of empagliflozin or other non-SGLT2i antihyperglycemics, predefined variables and covariates identified by a high-dimensional variable selection algorithm were used to build propensity scores. Weighted survival analyses were then applied to estimate the risk of MAKE.

Results

Compared with other antihyperglycemics, empagliflozin use was associated with 0.99 (95% CI 0.51, 1.55) mL/min/1.73 m 2 less annual reduction in eGFR, 0.25 (95% CI 0.16, 0.33) kg/m 2 more annual decrease in BMI, and reduced risk of MAKE (hazard ratio [HR] 0.68 [95% CI 0.64, 0.73]). Empagliflozin use was associated with reduced risk of MAKE in eGFR ≥ 90, ≥ 60 to < 90, ≥ 45 to < 60, and ≥ 30 to < 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (HR 0.70 [95% CI 0.60, 0.82], 0.66 [0.60, 0.73], 0.78 [0.69, 0.89]), and 0.71 [0.55, 0.92], respectively), in participants without albuminuria, with microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria (HR 0.65 [95% CI 0.57, 0.75], 0.72 [0.66. 0.79], and 0.74 [0.62, 0.88], respectively), and in participants with and without cardiovascular disease (HR 0.67 [95% CI 0.61, 0.74] and 0.76 [0.69, 0.83], respectively). The association was evident in per-protocol analyses, which required continuation of the assigned antihyperglycemic medication (empagliflozin or other antihyperglycemics) during follow-up (HR 0.64 [95% CI 0.60, 0.70]), and in analyses requiring concurrent use of metformin in at least the first 90 days of follow-up (HR 0.63 [0.57–0.69]).

Conclusions

Among people with type 2 diabetes, empagliflozin use was associated with eGFR preservation, a greater decline in BMI, and a reduced risk of MAKE compared with other non-SGLT2i antihyperglycemics.

TABLE 3
SGLT‐2 inhibitor CVOTs: renal outcomes in T2D patients without DKD

The EMPA‐REG OUTCOME trial included patients (N = 7034) with an eGFR of 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 or higher at screening, and 26% of patients had renal impairment (eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2) at baseline. 35, 81 Microalbuminuria was reported in 29% and macroalbuminuria in 11% of patients. Following the initiation of treatment with empagliflozin, a transient but significant decline in eGFR was observed at week 4 compared with placebo (mean ± SE change from baseline [mL/min/1.73 m 2]: −0.62 ± 0.04 in the 10 mg group, −0.82 ± 0.04 in the 25 mg group and +0.01 ± 0.04 in the placebo group; P < .001 for both comparisons). However, during long‐term treatment from week 4 to end of study, eGFR remained stable in the empagliflozin compared with the placebo group, where there was a steady decline in the eGFR (mean ± SE annual rate of decline [mL/min/1.73 m 2]: −0.19 ± 0.11 in both 10 and 25 mg groups vs. −1.67 ± 0.13 in the placebo group; P < .001 for both comparisons). The risk of doubling of serum creatinine was 44% lower in the empagliflozin group than placebo (HR 0.56, 95% CI, 0.39‐0.79; P < .001). 81 The relative risk of incident or worsening nephropathy (defined as progression to macroalbuminuria, doubling of serum creatinine level, initiation of renal‐replacement therapy or death from renal disease) was 39% lower in the empagliflozin compared with the placebo group (HR 0.61, 95% CI, 0.53‐0.70; P < .001). In addition, empagliflozin reduced progression to macroalbuminuria by 38% (HR 0.62, 95% CI, 0.54‐0.72; P < .001) and the risk of renal‐replacement therapy by 55% (HR 0.45, 95% CI, 0.21‐0.75; P < .001). There was no significant difference between the empagliflozin and placebo groups for the risk of incident albuminuria in patients with normal albuminuria. 81

### EMPA-REG OUTCOME: the nephrologist's point of view [^114e7uug]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

There is increasing evidence that sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have renoprotective effects, as demonstrated by the renal analyses from clinical trials including Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients-Removing Excess Glucose (EMPA-REG OUTCOME), CANagliflozin Treatment And Trial Analysis versus SUlphonylurea (CANTATA-SU), and the dapagliflozin renal study. The potential mechanisms responsible are likely multifactorial, and direct renovascular and hemodynamic effects are postulated to play a central role. This report reviews the renal outcomes data from key SGLT2 inhibitor clinical trials, discusses the hypotheses for SGLT2 inhibitor-associated renoprotection, and considers the main renal safety issues associated with SGLT2 inhibitor treatment.

### Empagliflozin and diuretic use in patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction… [^116GmPPE]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Findings In this post hoc analysis of a randomized clinical trial, empagliflozin was associated with comparable improvements in time to cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization, first and total heart failure hospitalizations, rate of decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate, and health status, regardless of background diuretic use or dose. Empagliflozin was also associated with a reduced likelihood of diuretic initiation or dose escalation and an increased likelihood of diuretic de-escalation and discontinuation after randomization. SGLT2 inhibitors prevent the absorption of sodium and glucose in the proximal renal tubule, resulting in natriuresis, glucosuria, and increased urine output. 2 In addition, several other mechanisms likely mediate the benefit from SGLT2 inhibitors, including increased autophagy, reduced inflammation, improvement.

Compared with placebo, empagliflozin was associated with decreased NT-proBNP levels similarly in the diuretic and nondiuretic groups. Findings were consistent when patients were categorized by diuretic dose. Empagliflozin was associated with reduced weight and hemoglobin A1c, with no significant interaction by diuretic status. However, categorization by diuretic dose revealed that patients taking higher doses of diuretics were significantly less likely to experience weight loss or a decrease in hemoglobin A1c at week 52. Empagliflozin was associated with increased hematocrit and decreased systolic blood pressure and uric acid, with no effect modification by diuretic status or dose.

Third, patients taking higher doses of diuretics were less likely to experience weight loss or decrease in hemoglobin A1c with empagliflozin. Fourth, among patients taking diuretics, the addition of empagliflozin was associated with an increased risk of volume depletion events but not of hyperkalemia or acute kidney failure. Fifth, patients randomized to empagliflozin had a lesser likelihood of diuretic initiation and dose escalation and a greater likelihood of diuretic de-escalation and permanent discontinuation.

### Long-term effects of empagliflozin in patients with chronic kidney disease [^111tPVXR]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Background

In the EMPA-KIDNEY trial, empagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, had positive cardiorenal effects in patients with chronic kidney disease who were at risk for disease progression. Post-trial follow-up was designed to assess how the effects of empagliflozin would evolve after the discontinuation of the trial drug.

Methods

In the active trial, patients with chronic kidney disease were randomly assigned to receive either empagliflozin (10 mg once daily) or matching placebo and were followed for a median of 2 years. All the patients had an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of at least 20 but less than 45 mL per minute per 1.73 m 2 of body-surface area or an eGFR of at least 45 but less than 90 mL per minute per 1.73 m 2 with a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (with albumin measured in milligrams and creatinine measured in grams) of at least 200. Subsequently, surviving patients who consented were observed for 2 additional years. No trial empagliflozin or placebo was administered during the post-trial period, but local practitioners could prescribe open-label SGLT2 inhibitors, including open-label empagliflozin. The primary composite outcome was kidney disease progression or cardiovascular death as assessed from the start of the active-trial period to the end of the post-trial period.

Results

Of the 6609 patients who had undergone randomization in the active trial, 4891 (74%) were enrolled in the post-trial period. During this period, the use of open-label SGLT2 inhibitors was similar in the two groups (43% in the empagliflozin group and 40% in the placebo group). During the combined active- and post-trial periods, a primary-outcome event occurred in 865 of 3304 patients (26.2%) in the empagliflozin group and in 1001 of 3305 patients (30.3%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.79; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.72 to 0.87). During the post-trial period only, the hazard ratio for a primary-outcome event was 0.87 (95% CI, 0.76 to 0.99). During the combined periods, the risk of kidney disease progression was 23.5% in the empagliflozin group and 27.1% in the placebo group; the risk of the composite of death or end-stage kidney disease was 16.9% and 19.6%, respectively; and the risk of cardiovascular death was 3.8% and 4.9%, respectively. There was no effect of empagliflozin on death from noncardiovascular causes (5.3% in both groups).

Conclusions

In a broad range of patients with chronic kidney disease at risk for progression, empagliflozin continued to have additional cardiorenal benefits for up to 12 months after it was discontinued.

### Efficacy and safety of empagliflozin added to existing antidiabetes treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^115gRbL1]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2014). Medium credibility.

Background

Diabetes is a leading cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD) worldwide. Optimum glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes is important to minimise the risk of microvascular and macrovascular complications and to slow the progression of CKD. We assessed the efficacy and safety of empagliflozin as an add-on treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes and CKD.

Methods

We did a phase 3, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial at 127 centres in 15 countries. Patients with HbA1c of 7% or greater to 10% or less were eligible for inclusion. Patients with stage 2 CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] ≥ 60 to < 90 mL/min per 1.73 m(2); n = 290) were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive empagliflozin 10 mg or 25 mg or placebo once daily for 52 weeks. Patients with stage 3 CKD (eGFR ≥ 30 to < 60 mL/min per 1.73 m(2); n = 374) were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive empagliflozin 25 mg or placebo for 52 weeks. Randomisation was done with a computer-generated random sequence and stratified by renal impairment, HbA1c, and background antidiabetes medication. Treatment assignment was masked from patients and investigators. The primary endpoint was change from baseline in HbA1c at week 24 by ANCOVA in the full analysis set. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01164501.

Findings

In patients with stage 2 CKD, adjusted mean treatment differences versus placebo in changes from baseline in HbA1c at week 24 were -0.52% (95% CI -0.72 to -0.32) for empagliflozin 10 mg and -0.68% (-0.88 to -0.49) for empagliflozin 25 mg (both p < 0.0001). In patients with stage 3 CKD, adjusted mean treatment difference versus placebo in change from baseline in HbA1c at week 24 was -0.42% (-0.56 to -0.28) for empagliflozin 25 mg (p < 0.0001). In patients with stage 2 CKD, adverse events were reported over 52 weeks by 83 patients (87%) on placebo (15 severe [16%] and 11 serious [12%]), 86 (88%) on empagliflozin 10 mg (six severe [6%] and six serious [6%]) and 78 (80%) on empagliflozin 25 mg (eight severe [8%] and seven serious [7%]). In patients with stage 3 CKD, adverse events were reported over 52 weeks by 156 patients (83%) on placebo (15 severe [8%] and 23 serious [12%]) and 156 (83%) on empagliflozin 25 mg (18 severe [10%] and 22 serious [12%]).

Interpretation

In patients with type 2 diabetes and stage 2 or 3 CKD, empagliflozin reduced HbA1c and was well tolerated. However, our findings might not be applicable to the general population of patients with type 2 diabetes and renal impairment.

### Cost-effectiveness of empagliflozin in patients with diabetic kidney disease in the United States: findings based on the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial [^111JT7BX]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Rationale & Objective

Benefits of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors on kidney outcomes have been demonstrated in clinical trials. Among patients with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular (CV) disease enrolled in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01131676), empagliflozin added to standard of care (SOC) reduced the risk of incident or worsening nephropathy compared with SOC alone. This analysis evaluated the cost-effectiveness of empagliflozin versus SOC alone in the subpopulation with diabetic kidney disease (DKD) from the perspective of US commercial insurers and Medicare.

Study Design

Discrete event simulation model.

Setting & Population

Patients with DKD in a US health care system.

Interventions

Empagliflozin 10 or 25mg with SOC versus SOC alone. SOC included glucose-lowering therapies and medications to treat CV risk factors.

Outcomes

Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (2020 US dollars per quality-adjusted life-year [QALY] gained). Costs and QALYs were discounted 3.0% per year.

Model, Perspective, & Time Frame

Cost-effectiveness analysis, commercial insurers and Medicare perspective, lifetime horizon.

Results

The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of empagliflozin with SOC versus SOC alone was $25,974 per QALY. Empagliflozin added 0.67 QALYs and $17,322 per patient over a lifetime horizon. Results were driven by fewer clinical events (including CV death, heart failure hospitalization, albuminuria progression, and a composite kidney outcome) experienced by patients receiving empagliflozin with SOC versus SOC alone. Results were sensitive to rates of CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and heart failure hospitalization, as well as to drug costs and time horizon. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses indicated 91% of simulations at < $50,000 per QALY.

Limitations

The EMPA-REG OUTCOME study was not powered to assess treatment benefits in a subgroup and excluded patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate < 30mL/min/1.73m 2.

Conclusions

Based on the EMPA-REG OUTCOME study, this cost-effectiveness analysis suggests that, for commercial insurers and Medicare, adding empagliflozin to SOC may be a cost-effective treatment option for patients with DKD.

### American association of clinical endocrinology consensus statement: comprehensive type 2 diabetes management algorithm-2023 update [^113fNY3E]. Endocrine Practice (2023). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes with diabetic kidney disease (DKD) — SGLT2 inhibitor and GLP-1 RA renal guidance: Nearly 50% of U.S. adults with kidney failure have DM, and SGLT2 inhibitors show an approximately 38% reduction in composite adverse renal outcomes; use of an SGLT2i with proven benefit is recommended as foundational therapy to reduce progression of DKD and CV risk for persons with T2D and DKD with eGFR ≥ 25 mL/min/1.73 m² or ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m^2 if HF is also present. Dapagliflozin trials included participants with eGFR ≥ 25 to 75 mL/min/1.73 m^2 (including persons without DM) and empagliflozin trials included eGFR 30 to < 90 mL/min/1.73 m^2 (including persons with T2D ≥ 20%); dapagliflozin slowed decline more in T2D, while empagliflozin had similar eGFR decline across groups. GLP-1 RAs also are an option for reducing albuminuria progression, eGFR decline, and ASCVD risk in T2D with DKD with eGFR 15 mL/min/1.73 m^2.

### Rationale, design, and baseline characteristics of a randomized, placebo-controlled cardiovascular outcome trial of empagliflozin (EMPA-REG OUTCOME ™) [^113TJhwn]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2014). Low credibility.

With 7034 patients enrolled and treated, the trial is in keeping with the 2008 FDA guidance on evaluating the CV risk of new therapies to treat T2DM but may also provide insights beyond CV safety, including impact on microvascular, in particular renal outcomes, as detailed above. A theoretical basis for renal protection with SGLT2 inhibitors has been proposed, encompassing reduction in tubular stress as well as glucose-induced inflammation and fibrotic markers in the proximal tubule in vitro and in animal models, as well as improvement in glucose and BP control, reduction in plasma uric acid and albuminuria, and reduction in glomerular hyperfiltration with improvement in glomerular capillary hypertension.

Since the majority (i.e. 78%) of participants in EMPA-REG OUTCOME™ had some degree (i.e. CKD 2 or 3) of renal impairment at baseline, including 11% with macroalbuminuria, this trial is also expected to provide valuable information on the effect of empagliflozin on renal outcomes. Of note, renal outcomes comprise the dedicated scope for two other SGLT2i outcome trials, i.e. the CANVAS-R trial (clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT01989754) which will investigate the effects of canagliflozin on progression of albuminuria in 5700 patients with T2DM and the CREDENCE trial (clinical trials.gov identifier NCT02065791) which will investigate the effects of canagliflozin on the incidence of end-stage kidney disease, serum- creatinine doubling and renal and CV death in 3627 patients with T2DM and stage 2 and 3 CKD and macroalbuminuria, estimated to report in 2017 and 2019, respectively.

In summary, it is expected that the results of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME™ trial will provide evidence concerning the CV safety of empagliflozin, as well as provide insights on the potential benefits of empagliflozin on CV and microvascular outcomes. Thus the results of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME™ trial will help to inform clinical decision-making for patients with T2DM.

### Nephrotic-range proteinuria in type 2 diabetes: effects of empagliflozin on kidney disease progression and clinical outcomes [^113mR9Qr]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

This study included only diabetic patients, and 60% of the NRP subgroup had been diagnosed with diabetic nephropathy. Hence, they represent one of the most susceptible populations – outcomes are significantly worse in patients with diabetic nephropathy than in patients with non-diabetic nephropathy. Our results may therefore not be representative for patients with other causes of NRP.

As very low rates of actual ESKD were observed in EMPA-REG OUTCOME, we decided to estimate hypothetical time to projected ESKD based on individual participants' eGFR intercepts and slopes by extrapolation, conditioning upon linearity of eGFR change over time. This expands beyond the study observation time and may not exactly reflect the non-linear course of disease progression. Further, we assume that a patient does not die before projected ESKD, so any differences in mortality between the groups may have not been accounted for. Also, we considered all NRP patients to reach hypothetical projected ESKD at maximum at 15 years, potentially over-estimating the rate of ESKD particularly in NRP patients with slower eGFR decline. The use of slopes during the three prespecified study periods can lead to potential selection bias of patients with available data. Further, the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial had a lower eGFR cut-off of 30 mL/min/1.73 m² at screening, and therefore our results are limited to T2DM patients with CKD stages 1–3 and may not be generalisable to more advanced stages of diabetic kidney disease. The first dedicated study of an SGLT2 inhibitor in a larger proteinuric population was the Canagliflozin and Renal Endpoints in Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation (CREDENCE, NCT02065791) trial. followed by the Dapagliflozin And Prevention of Adverse outcomes in Chronic Kidney Disease (DAPA-CKD, NCT03036150). Direct comparison of these trials with EMPA-REG OUTCOME should be made with caution owing to differences in study design, populations, and methodology. However, interestingly in the CREDENCE population, the treatment effect of canagliflozin on albuminuria (mean% difference vs placebo over study period –31% [95% CI: –26 to –35]) was very similar to the overall, less proteinuric EMPA-REG OUTCOME population (mean % difference at week 12 vs placebo –32% [95% CI –47 to –13]).

Renal outcomes in EMPA-REG OUTCOME

The population of EMPA-REG OUTCOME included a substantial renal burden, with eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73m 2 in 26% of patients and 60– < 90 mL/min/1.73m 2 in 52% of patients. The main pre-specified renal composite outcome of new or worsening nephropathy (progression to macroalbuminuria, doubling of the serum creatinine level, initiation of renal-replacement therapy, or death from renal disease) was significantly reduced by 39%, and doubling of serum creatinine with an eGFR ≤ 45 mL/min/1.73m 2 was reduced by 44% when adding empagliflozin to standard of care.

Significant benefits were also seen in several other prespecified renal parameters, including a 32% RRR in new or worsening nephropathy or CV death (p < 0.001); 38% RRR in progression to macroalbuminuria (p < 0.001); and 55% RRR in initiation of renal replacement therapy (p = 0.04). The only exception was incident albuminuria in patients with a normal albumin level at baseline, where no significant difference between study arms was observed.

The renal results in EMPA-REG OUTCOME indicate that empagliflozin delays the progression of renal disease when compared with placebo. The change in eGFR over time also supports a nephroprotective effect: after an initial fall when empagliflozin therapy was started, the eGFR of subjects on empagliflozin recovered somewhat and subsequently remained stable, whereas those on placebo demonstrated a steady decline over the period of the study. Furthermore, a post hoc analysis showed that the renal benefits seen with empagliflozin in the full study cohort were consistent in a subgroup of patients with prevalent kidney disease at baseline, defined as having an eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73m 2 and/or macroalbuminuria (UACR > 300 mg/g).

Despite the promising renal results, it should be noted that EMPA-REG OUTCOME was a CV trial with 3P-MACE as the primary endpoint, and therefore we await the results of an ongoing dedicated renal study before making a more conclusive assessment of empagliflozin in this setting. Furthermore, in accordance with local prescribing information and licences for SGLT2 inhibitors, if the eGFR is below 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 then empagliflozin should not be initiated and must be discontinued if the eGFR persistently falls below 45 ml/min/1.73 m 2.

Clinical outcomes

We compared the treatment effects of empagliflozin versus placebo in participants with NRP versus non-NRP for the clinical outcomes of 3P-MACE, all-cause mortality, CV death, combination of hospitalisation for heart failure (HHF) or CV death (excluding fatal stroke), and all-cause hospitalisation. Kidney endpoints were also evaluated, including incident or worsening nephropathy, sustained eGFR decline ≥ 40% (i.e. ≥ 2 consecutive measurements that were ≥ 28 days apart) from baseline, and the hard kidney composite outcome comprising events of doubling of serum creatinine accompanied by an eGFR of ≤ 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2, initiation of kidney replacement therapy (KRT), or death from kidney disease. Treatment for patients considered at risk for the various endpoints followed the rationale pre-specified for the study. For the analyses of 3P-MACE, all-cause mortality, CV death, HHF or CV death (excluding fatal stroke), and all-cause hospitalization, all patients randomized and treated who had data available for the baseline covariates used in the model were included. All remaining 6953 patients with available baseline UACR data were included in the current analyses. For kidney endpoints, patients with missing baseline eGFR or no post-baseline eGFR measurement were excluded from the risk set for endpoints/components of doubling of serum creatinine or sustained eGFR decline ≥ 40% from baseline. For albuminuria changes, only patients with available baseline and at least one post-baseline UACR measurement were included in the analysis. For endpoints that required the condition to be sustained, if the condition occurred only with the last laboratory measurement, the patient was considered as not having an event.

Changes in albuminuria

Changes in albuminuria were assessed post hoc and analysed as time to new onset of sustained (i.e. ≥ 2 consecutive measurements that were ≥ 28 days apart) improvement in albuminuria status relative to baseline (sustained reduction ≥ 50% or ≥ 30% from baseline UACR). In addition, new onset of full remission (defined as sustained UACR < 0.5 g/g), or partial remission (defined as sustained UACR < 1.0 g/g) were assessed in participants not meeting the criterion at baseline.

### Empagliflozin in patients with chronic kidney disease [^112kjQJi]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

The study EMPA-KIDNEY was published by EMPA-KIDNEY Collaborative Group and colleagues in 2023 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Chronic kidney disease. In the EMPA-KIDNEY study, the trial question was: what is the role of empagliflozin in patients with CKD? In the EMPA-KIDNEY study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the EMPA-KIDNEY study, the population was: 6609 patients (2192 female, 4417 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with CKD with an eGFR ≥ 20 and < 45 mL/min/1.73 m², or ≥ 45 and < 90 mL/min/1.73 m² with a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio ≥ 200. The key exclusion criteria were polycystic kidney disease; receipt of kidney transplant. In the EMPA-KIDNEY study, the interventions were: n = 3304 empagliflozin (at a dose of 10 mg/day) n = 3305 placebo (matching placebo). In the EMPA-KIDNEY study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in progression of kidney disease or death from cardiovascular causes (13.1% vs. 16.9%; HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.82). In the EMPA-KIDNEY study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in hospitalization for HF or death from cardiovascular causes (4% vs. 4.6%; HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.07) Significant decrease in the incidence of hospitalization for any cause (24.8 events /100 py vs. 29.2 events /100 py; HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.95) No significant difference in death from any cause (4.5% vs. 5.1%; HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.7 to 1.08). In the EMPA-KIDNEY study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in serious adverse events. In the EMPA-KIDNEY study, the conclusion was: in patients with CKD with an eGFR ≥ 20 and < 45 mL/min/1.73 m², or ≥ 45 and < 90 mL/min/1.73 m² with a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio ≥ 200, empagliflozin was superior to placebo with respect to progression of kidney disease or death from cardiovascular causes.

### Cardiovascular and renal outcomes with canagliflozin according to baseline kidney function [^1153iGBk]. Circulation (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Excess mortality and morbidity in type 2 diabetes primarily result from cardiovascular and kidney disease. Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are a class of medications that promote urinary glucose excretion and natriuresis, and alter glomerular hemodynamics. These changes have been noted to result in improvements in glycemic status, blood pressure, weight, and proteinuria in patients with type 2 diabetes, and have translated into a reduction in cardiovascular events and preservation of kidney function in large cardiovascular outcome trials. –

The glucose-lowering effect of SGLT2 inhibitors is reliant on glomerular filtration. Previous studies have shown that the glycemic efficacy of SGLT2 inhibitors is attenuated in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD), defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2. As such, these agents are not currently recommended for use in people with significantly reduced kidney function, defined as an eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 with canagliflozin and empagliflozin or < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 with dapagliflozin and ertugliflozin. Conversely, the efficacy of SGLT2 inhibitors at reducing blood pressure and proteinuria may be maintained in people with diabetes and CKD.

As individuals with CKD are among the highest-risk groups for cardiovascular disease and progression to end-stage kidney disease, it is important to understand whether the benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors for cardiovascular events and progression of renal disease are similar to those in people with normal kidney function.

We undertook a range of post hoc analyses of data from the CANVAS Program to determine the effect of canagliflozin on cardiovascular, renal, and safety outcomes across different levels of kidney function to better understand whether this agent may have a role in people with type 2 diabetes and CKD at high cardiovascular risk, including those with eGFR between 30 and 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 for whom this treatment is not currently approved.

T2D is a well-established risk factor for development and progression of CKD. KDIGO recommends categorization of risk by likelihood of progression to ESKD. Compared to placebo, empagliflozin decreases likelihood of worsening (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.62–0.78) and increases likelihood of improvement (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.30–1.86) in KDIGO risk category.

### Chronic kidney disease and risk management: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^113dFj4k]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

EMPA-KIDNEY (empagliflozin) in chronic kidney disease — eligibility and outcomes at low eGFR: participants had an eGFR of at least 20 but less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m^2 or an eGFR of at least 45 but less than 90 mL/min/1.73 m^2 with a UACR of at least 200 mg/g creatinine; approximately one-half of the 6,609 participants had diabetes. Empagliflozin lowered progression of kidney disease and death from cardiovascular causes (HR 0.72 [95% CI 0.64–0.82]; P < 0.001). Notably, while glucose-lowering effects are blunted with eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m^2, renal and cardiovascular benefits were still seen at eGFR levels as low as < 20 mL/min/1.73 m^2 with no significant change in long-term eGFR decline compared with standard of care.

### The effect of SGLT-2 inhibitors on albuminuria and proteinuria in diabetes mellitus: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^112Pf8eo]. Journal of Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Diabetic kidney disease is a serious microvascular complication of diabetes mellitus and the leading cause of end-stage renal disease in western countries. New therapeutic agents are needed to delay its onset and progression. Recent literature suggests that sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors may have renoprotective effects. Our aim was to systematically review the effect of SGLT-2 inhibitors on albuminuria and proteinuria in patients with diabetes mellitus. Studies were identified by search in major electronic databases, clinical trial registers, and sources of gray literature. We included randomized controlled trials of currently approved SGLT-2 inhibitors with a duration of at least 12 weeks. The primary outcome was the between-groups difference in the proportional (%) change of albuminuria or proteinuria between baseline and end of treatment. SGLT-2 inhibitors were associated with statistically significant reduction in albuminuria compared to placebo or active control [weighted mean difference (WMD) -25.39%, 95% confidence interval (CI) -34.17 to -16.62] (15 studies, N = 17540 patients). When trials were stratified according to the level of baseline albuminuria, reduction in urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio was more prominent in randomized controlled trials in patients with moderately (WMD -40.78%, 95% CI -63.21 to -18.34) or severely increased albuminuria (WMD -36.40%, 95% CI -51.53 to -21.26). Only one study reported data for urine protein-to-creatinine ratio. Finally, SGLT-2 inhibitors reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 4.43mmHg (95% CI -5.24 to -3.63) and 1.81mmHg (95% CI -2.38 to -1.23), respectively.

### Characterization and implications of the initial estimated glomerular filtration rate' dip' upon sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibition with empagliflozin in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial [^111a2SUT]. Kidney International (2021). Medium credibility.

Treatment with sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors induces an initial 3–5 ml/min/1.73 m 2 decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Although considered to be of hemodynamic origin and largely reversible, this 'eGFR dip' may cause concern in clinical practice, which highlights the need to better understand its incidence and clinical implications. In this post hoc analysis of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial, 6,668 participants randomized to empagliflozin 10 mg, 25 mg or placebo with eGFR available at baseline and week four were categorized by initial eGFR change into three groups; over 10% decline ('eGFR dipper'), over 0 and up to 10% decline ('eGFR intermediate'), no eGFR decline ('eGFR non-dipper'). Baseline characteristics of 'eGFR intermediate' and 'eGFR non-dipper' were generally comparable. An initial 'eGFR dip' was observed in 28.3% of empagliflozin versus 13.4% of placebo-treated participants; odds ratio 2.7 [95% Confidence Interval 2.3–3.0]. In multivariate logistic regression, diuretic use and higher KDIGO risk category at baseline were independently predictive of an 'eGFR dip' in empagliflozin versus placebo. Safety and beneficial treatment effects with empagliflozin on cardiovascular and kidney outcomes were consistent across subgroups based on these predictive factors. The initial 'eGFR dip' did not have a major impact on the treatment effect of empagliflozin on subsequent cardiovascular death, hospitalization for heart failure, and incident or worsening kidney disease. Thus, patients with type 2 diabetes with more advanced kidney disease and/or on diuretic therapy were more likely to experience an 'eGFR dip' of over 10% with empagliflozin, but reduction in cardiovascular and kidney outcomes was not relevantly modified by such 'eGFR dip'.

### Nephrotic-range proteinuria in type 2 diabetes: effects of empagliflozin on kidney disease progression and clinical outcomes [^1131igJt]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this post-hoc analysis of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial we suggest that empagliflozin had a protective effect against cardiovascular events, worsening of kidney function and albuminuria in T2DM patients with established CVD who had very high risk of accelerated kidney disease progression because of NRP. Treatment benefit was consistent between patients with or without NRP and tended to be statistically larger on regression (> 30% reduction vs baseline) of albuminuria and eGFR slope in patients with NRP.

The NRP subgroup included highly vulnerable participants who were sicker overall compared with participants with non-nephrotic proteinuria. In line with this, the NRP subgroup experienced substantially increased rates of relevant clinical outcomes and most adverse events. Except for genital infections, adverse event rates were similar or lower with empagliflozin compared with placebo in both NRP and non-NRP groups, showing a reassuring safety profile in a very fragile population. But more importantly, empagliflozin slowed kidney function decline and consistently reduced albuminuria on top of concomitant treatment with ACE inhibitors or ARBs more effectivley in NRP than in non-NRP participants. Notably, empagliflozin also improved clinical outcomes, reducing all-cause hospitalization by 39% in this sick subgroup of EMPA-REG OUTCOME participants. Finding that within both proteinuria strata main baseline characteristics were similar between treatment groups corroborated the hypothesis that study findings reflected a genuine effect of the SGLT2 inhibitor. Consistently, adjustments for the small differences in between-group distribution of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system (RAAS) inhibitors and statin therapy, confirmed the treatment benefits.

### Chronic kidney disease and risk management: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^111Ei8NA]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes with chronic kidney disease (CKD) — sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are recommended for high-risk CKD and for use at lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) levels. SGLT2 inhibitors are recommended for individuals at high risk of CKD progression, and for people with type 2 diabetes and CKD, use in individuals with eGFR ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m2 is recommended to reduce CKD progression and cardiovascular events. The eGFR limit is supported by major trial criteria (CREDENCE: eGFR > 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 and UACR > 300 mg/g; DAPA-CKD: eGFR > 25 mL/min/1.73 m2 and UACR > 200 mg/g), analyses suggesting safety and effectiveness at eGFR levels of > 20 mL/min/1.73 m2, and EMPA-KIDNEY efficacy in participants with eGFR as low as 20 mL/min/1.73 m2. Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) may also be used at low eGFR for cardiovascular protection but may require dose adjustment.

### American association of clinical endocrinology consensus statement: comprehensive type 2 diabetes management algorithm-2023 update [^116dUpym]. Endocrine Practice (2023). High credibility.

American Association of Clinical Endocrinology 2023 type 2 diabetes — cardiovascular risk therapy selection states that GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) lower major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in meta-analysis (hazard ratio [HR] 0.86, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.80–0.93, P < .001), while sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) reduce hospitalization for heart failure (HF) and cardiovascular death, including a 32% reduction in HF hospitalization (HR 0.68 [95% CI 0.61–0.76]) and a 15% reduction in CV death (HR 0.85 [95% CI 0.78–0.93]) versus placebo. For persons with T2D and established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) or at high risk, a GLP-1 RA with cardiovascular benefit should be initiated as first-line therapy independent of A1C goal or other antihyperglycemic treatments, and as an alternative clinicians may recommend an SGLT2i with proven cardiovascular benefit to reduce MACE or CV death in persons with T2D and established ASCVD. SGLT2is should be recommended in persons with T2D and HF regardless of A1C goal or other antihyperglycemic treatments, and they have been shown to improve HF-related symptoms irrespective of left ventricular ejection fraction and background therapies. High-risk trial features included "albuminuria or proteinuria, HTN and LV hypertrophy, LV systolic or diastolic dysfunction, and/or ABI < 0.9". DPP-4 inhibitors show neutrality for MACE, but saxagliptin increased HF hospitalizations and caution is advised with alogliptin in New York Heart Association Class III or IV CHF. Thiazolidinediones can worsen fluid retention and should not be used in symptomatic HF, and initiation of pioglitazone is contraindicated in New York Heart Association Class III or Class IV CHF.

### Effects of empagliflozin on progression of chronic kidney disease: a prespecified secondary analysis from the empa-kidney trial [^114bpzdA]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

Background

Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors reduce progression of chronic kidney disease and the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in a wide range of patients. However, their effects on kidney disease progression in some patients with chronic kidney disease are unclear because few clinical kidney outcomes occurred among such patients in the completed trials. In particular, some guidelines stratify their level of recommendation about who should be treated with SGLT2 inhibitors based on diabetes status and albuminuria. We aimed to assess the effects of empagliflozin on progression of chronic kidney disease both overall and among specific types of participants in the EMPA-KIDNEY trial.

Methods

EMPA-KIDNEY, a randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial, was conducted at 241 centres in eight countries (Canada, China, Germany, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, the UK, and the USA), and included individuals aged 18 years or older with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 20 to less than 45 mL/min per 1.73 m 2, or with an eGFR of 45 to less than 90 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 with a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (uACR) of 200 mg/g or higher. We explored the effects of 10 mg oral empagliflozin once daily versus placebo on the annualised rate of change in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR slope), a tertiary outcome. We studied the acute slope (from randomisation to 2 months) and chronic slope (from 2 months onwards) separately, using shared parameter models to estimate the latter. Analyses were done in all randomly assigned participants by intention to treat. EMPA-KIDNEY is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03594110.

Findings

Between May 15, 2019, and April 16, 2021, 6609 participants were randomly assigned and then followed up for a median of 2.0 years (IQR 1.5–2.4). Prespecified subgroups of eGFR included 2282 (34.5%) participants with an eGFR of less than 30 mL/min per 1.73 m 2, 2928 (44.3%) with an eGFR of 30 to less than 45 mL/min per 1.73 m 2, and 1399 (21.2%) with an eGFR 45 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 or higher. Prespecified subgroups of uACR included 1328 (20.1%) with a uACR of less than 30 mg/g, 1864 (28.2%) with a uACR of 30 to 300 mg/g, and 3417 (51.7%) with a uACR of more than 300 mg/g. Overall, allocation to empagliflozin caused an acute 2.12 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 (95% CI 1.83–2.41) reduction in eGFR, equivalent to a 6% (5–6) dip in the first 2 months. After this, it halved the chronic slope from -2.75 to -1.37 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 per year (relative difference 50%, 95% CI 42–58). The absolute and relative benefits of empagliflozin on the magnitude of the chronic slope varied significantly depending on diabetes status and baseline levels of eGFR and uACR. In particular, the absolute difference in chronic slopes was lower in patients with lower baseline uACR, but because this group progressed more slowly than those with higher uACR, this translated to a larger relative difference in chronic slopes in this group (86% [36–136] reduction in the chronic slope among those with baseline uACR < 30 mg/g compared with a 29% [19–38] reduction for those with baseline uACR ≥ 2000 mg/g; p trend < 0.0001).

Interpretation

Empagliflozin slowed the rate of progression of chronic kidney disease among all types of participant in the EMPA-KIDNEY trial, including those with little albuminuria. Albuminuria alone should not be used to determine whether to treat with an SGLT2 inhibitor.

### Effects of empagliflozin on urine biomarkers in EMPA-KIDNEY [^115uq3ry]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale & Objective

Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors substantially slow progression of chronic kidney disease and reduce risk of acute kidney injury, but their effects on kidney physiology are incompletely understood. This study sought to assess the effects of empagliflozin on a comprehensive set of urine tubular and glomerular biomarkers.

Study Design

Randomized controlled trial.

Setting & Participants

2,752 participants from EMPA-KIDNEY.

Exposure

Empagliflozin 10mg daily versus placebo.

Outcome

Urine biomarkers indexed to urine creatinine and averaged across on-study timepoints. Urine biomarkers included markers of glomerular disease (albumin, total protein); proximal tubular reabsorption (alpha-1 microglobulin [α1M]); functional tubular reserve (epidermal growth factor [EGF], uromodulin [UMOD]); tubular injury/inflammation (kidney injury molecule-1 [KIM-1], neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin [NGAL]) and; tubular ischemia/stress (dickkopf-3 [DKK-3], monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 [MCP-1]).

Analytical Approach

Mixed model repeated measures.

Results

Allocation to empagliflozin reduced urine albumin by 19% (95% CI; -24,-14%), total protein by 7% (-11, -2%), and UMOD by 63% (-65, -61%). It increased α1M by 29% (25, 34%), DKK-3 by 22% (16, 29%), and NGAL by 7% (0, 13%). Overall, there were no significant effects on EGF (1%, -1,4%), KIM-1 (2%, -1,6%), and MCP-1 (0%, -4,3%). The magnitude of effects on biomarker levels was generally similar at 2 and 18 months of follow-up. The large reductions in UMOD were evident regardless of baseline diabetes status, primary cause of kidney disease, and level of eGFR and or albuminuria. Exploratory mediation analyses suggest that reductions in albuminuria and UMOD accounted for 32% (15–52%) of the beneficial effect of empagliflozin on chronic eGFR slope.

Limitations

The mediation analyses cannot be used to formally confirm that UMOD reduction is a causal mediator for the kidney benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors.

Conclusion

SGLT2 inhibition imparts a large and sustained reduction in urine UMOD, and also increases some biomarkers partially reabsorbed by proximal tubules, without consistently affecting markers of tubular injury. These effects deserve further detailed experimental exploration, particularly the effect on thick ascending limb-derived UMOD, which could represent a novel mechanism of kidney protection.

### SGLT-2 inhibitors: a deeper dive into their renal protective properties beyond glycemic control and proteinuria reduction [^11689eE4]. American Journal of Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is highly prevalent and associated with increasing burden on patients and healthcare system. Its complex causes and diverse manifestation pose considerable challenge in slowing the disease progression. Over the last few decades, the pharmacotherapeutic strategies have primarily focused on reducing albuminuria, managing complications, and alleviating symptoms. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors, known for their glycemic control and cardiovascular benefits in diabetic patients, have shown promise in renal protection, offering hope for slowing CKD progression in a broader patient population.

Summary

The DAPA-CKD and EMPA-KIDNEY trials have provided compelling evidence that dapagliflozin and empagliflozin reduced the risk of a series of renal events and slowed the chronic decline of eGFR in patients with CKD, irrespective of diabetic status. The results of these trials strongly support the notion that SGLT-2 inhibitors are effective in renal protection across CKD patients with diverse primary diseases and in varying CKD risk categories. EMPA-KIDNEY also demonstrated that empagliflozin can potentially slow CKD progression in patients without albuminuria, a finding collaborated by results from several other studies. The long-term cardiorenal benefits of empagliflozin were further demonstrated in the post-trial follow-up sub-study of EMPA-KIDNEY. The synergistic effect of SGLT-2 inhibitors with other drugs that have different mechanisms of action is being researched for broader applications.

Key Messages

Emerging evidence underscores the potential of SGLT-2 inhibitors to benefit a wide range of CKD patients, regardless of causes and albuminuria status. Further research in this area will improve our understanding of the roles of this new class of drug in renal protection and potentially shift the paradigm of CKD management.

### Nephrotic-range proteinuria in type 2 diabetes: effects of empagliflozin on kidney disease progression and clinical outcomes [^115MKsby]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Empagliflozin benefits with respect to long-term kidney function and sustained reduction in albuminuria may at least partially be due to a reduction in intraglomerular pressure and glomerular hyperfiltration, but emerging evidence indicates other potential contributing mechanisms, such as anti-inflammatory or anti-fibrotic effects of SGLT2 inhibitors. As previously observed with ACE inhibitors in patients with non-diabetic proteinuric nephropathies, the effect on UACR reduction appears to be more pronounced in participants with higher baseline glomerular protein traffic. This is especially important as the degree of glomerular protein traffic is closely associated with adverse kidney and CV outcomes, and remission of proteinuria is an indicator of risk reduction and nephroprotection in NRP.

Almost 60% of the participants with NRP in EMPA-REG OUTCOME experienced a sustained ≥ 50% reduction in albuminuria, with roughly 1 in 6 achieving complete remission to < 500 mg/g and more than one in three achieved partial remission to < 1000 mg/g with empagliflozin treatment over the follow-up. Thus, the relevant reduction in albuminuria could have been a contributor to the overall benefits observed in the NRP population.

Our data suggest that empagliflozin may slow chronic loss of kidney function during the long-term treatment period, and that nominally the absolute effect is more pronounced in participants with NRP than those without. Indeed, empagliflozin reverted the annual eGFR loss of 10 mL/min per year seen with placebo to an eGFR decline comparable to the approximately –3.5 to –4 mL/min per year previously described for T2DM patients in the sub-nephrotic range. Moreover, when extrapolating the individual estimated eGFR slopes beyond the treatment phase, these differences in loss of kidney function translated into a hypothetical median net benefit of approximately 5 years that may be gained before dialysis or transplantation would be required.

The kidney function data compares well to data from the REIN study (NCT02895425) in patients with NRP, even when we include the initial eGFR decline as done in REIN. Thus, the treatment effect of empagliflozin appears comparable to the treatment effect of ramipril versus placebo in the REIN study, which was terminated prematurely due to the highly significant benefit on eGFR decline. Nevertheless, the statistically larger treatment benefit in the NRP group needs to be interpreted with caution and put in perspective with the fact that empagliflozin treatment completely abolished the annual eGFR decline in the non-NRP participants.

SGLT2 inhibitors with demonstrated cardiovascular (CV) benefit — indications — are specified by agent. Canagliflozin indications are to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D) as an adjunct to diet and exercise, reduce the risk of MI, stroke, or CV death in adults with T2D and CV disease, and reduce the risk of end-stage kidney disease, doubling of serum creatinine, CV death, and hospitalization for heart failure (HF) in patients with T2D and diabetic nephropathy with albuminuria. Dapagliflozin indications are to improve glycemic control in adults with T2D as an adjunct to diet and exercise, reduce the risk of hospitalization for HF in adults with T2D and established CV disease or multiple CV risk factors, and reduce the risk of CV death and hospitalization for HF in adults with HFrEF. Empagliflozin indications are to improve glycemic control in adults with T2D as an adjunct to diet and exercise and reduce risk of CV death in adults with T2D and established CV disease.

### Effects of empagliflozin on the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio in patients with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease: an exploratory analysis from the EMPA-REG OUTCOME randomised, placebo-controlled trial [^115bwJby]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2017). Medium credibility.

Background

In a pooled analysis of short-term trials, short-term treatment with the sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor empagliflozin reduced albuminuria in patients with type 2 diabetes and prevalent albuminuria. In this exploratory analysis of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial, we report the short-term and long-term effects of empagliflozin on albuminuria in patients with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease, according to patients' baseline albuminuria status.

Methods

In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial at 590 sites in 42 countries, we randomly assigned patients aged 18 years and older with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease (1:1:1) to empagliflozin 10 mg, empagliflozin 25 mg, or placebo in addition to standard of care until at least 691 patients experienced an adjudicated event included in the primary outcome. We did the randomisation with a computer-generated random-sequence and interactive voice-response and web-response system, stratified by HbA 1c, BMI, region, and estimated glomerular filtration rate. Patients, investigators, and individuals involved in analysis of trial data were masked to treatment assignment. The primary and secondary efficacy and safety endpoints of this trial have been reported previously. Here, we report urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) data for the pooled empagliflozin group versus placebo according to albuminuria status at baseline (normoalbuminuria: UACR < 30 mg/g; microalbuminuria: UACR ≥ 30 to ≤ 300 mg/g; and macroalbuminuria: UACR > 300 mg/g). We did the analysis with mixed-model repeated measures including prespecified and post-hoc tests. This study is completed and registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01131676.

Findings

Between Sept 1, 2010, and April 22, 2013, we randomly assigned 7028 patients to treatment groups and 7020 patients received treatment. At baseline, we had UACR data for 6953 patients: 4171 (59% of treated patients; 1382 assigned to placebo and 2789 assigned to empagliflozin) had normoalbuminuria, 2013 (29%; 675 assigned to placebo and 1338 assigned to empagliflozin) had microalbuminuria, and 769 (11%; 260 assigned to placebo and 509 assigned to empagliflozin) had macroalbuminuria. Median treatment duration was 2.6 years (IQR 2.0–3.4; 136 weeks) and median observation time was 3.1 years (2.2–3.6; 164 weeks). After short-term treatment at week 12, the placebo-adjusted geometric mean ratio of UACR change from baseline with empagliflozin was -7% (95% CI -12 to -2; p = 0.013) in patients with normoalbuminuria, -25% (-31 to -19; p < 0.0001) in patients with microalbuminuria, and -32% (-41 to -23; p < 0.0001) in patients with macroalbuminuria. The reductions in UACR were maintained with empagliflozin in all three groups compared with placebo during long-term treatment when measured at 164 weeks. At follow-up, after cessation of treatment for a median of 34 or 35 days, UACR was lower in the empagliflozin versus placebo group in those with baseline microalbuminuria (placebo-corrected adjusted geometric mean ratio of relative change from baseline with empagliflozin: -22%, 95% CI -32 to -11; p = 0.0003) or macroalbuminuria (-29%, -44 to -10; p = 0.0048), but not for patients with baseline normoalbuminuria (1%, -8 to 10; p = 0.8911). Patients treated with empagliflozin were more likely to experience a sustained improvement from microalbuminuria to normoalbuminuria (hazard ratio [HR] 1.43, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.67; p < 0.0001) or from macroalbuminuria to microalbuminuria or normoalbuminuria (HR 1.82, 1.40 to 2.37; p < 0.0001), and less likely to experience a sustained deterioration from normoalbuminuria to microalbuminuria or macroalbuminuria (HR 0.84, 0.74 to 0.95; p = 0.0077). The proportions of patients with any adverse events, serious adverse events, and adverse events leading to discontinuation increased with worsening UACR status at baseline, but were similar between treatment groups. The proportion of patients with genital infections was greater with empagliflozin than placebo in all subgroups by UACR status.

Interpretation

These results support short-term and long-term benefits of empagliflozin on urinary albumin excretion, irrespective of patients' albuminuria status at baseline.

The Potential of SGLT2 Inhibitors as Treatment for Patients with T2DM and HF or CKD

SGLT2 inhibitors are a relatively new class of treatment that improve glycaemic control in patients with T2DM by decreasing renal glucose reabsorption and increasing urinary glucose excretion. In addition to glycaemic effects, SGLT2 inhibitors are increasingly recognised to exert significant cardiorenal outcome benefits.

SGLT2 Inhibitor Cardiovascular Outcome Trials

Previously, two SGLT2 inhibitor cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs) have shown a reduction in the risk of major adverse CV events (MACE) in patients with T2DM and established CVD or at high CV risk: the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial with empagliflozin (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01131676) and the CANVAS program with canagliflozin (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01032629). These studies also showed reductions in the risk of CV death with empagliflozin and the risk of HFH with both empagliflozin and canagliflozin. The results of these CVOTs are mainly relevant for the prevention of recurrent CV events rather than the prevention of new CV events as EMPA-REG OUTCOME enrolled only patients with established CVD, and in CANVAS, the reduction in the risk of CV events was considerably less for patients without prior CV events than in the overall population or those with prior CV events.

In contrast to EMPA-REG OUTCOME and CANVAS, the CREDENCE study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02065791) was designed to specifically assess effects on clinically important outcomes in patients with T2DM at high risk of kidney disease progression. The study evaluated the efficacy and safety of canagliflozin versus placebo, when used in addition to standard of care. All study patients had an eGFR of 30 to < 90 ml/min/1.73 m 2 and albuminuria (urinary albumin/creatinine ratio > 300 to 5000 mg/g) and were treated with renin–angiotensin system blockade. Patients receiving canagliflozin had a 30% reduction in the risk of the primary composite endpoint, comprising progression to ESRD, doubling of serum creatinine, and renal or CV death, compared to patients in the placebo group. There was also a reduced risk of the secondary CV endpoints, including the risk of CV death and HFH by 31%, MACE by 20% and the risk of HFH alone by 39%.

### Short-term changes in albuminuria and risk of cardiovascular and renal outcomes in type 2 diabetes mellitus: a post hoc analysis of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial [^115FJLRD]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Renal outcomes occurred less frequently compared with cardiovascular outcomes in the lower albuminuria subgroup, but the frequency was similar in the highest albuminuria subgroup. Accordingly, the relative risk relationship was stronger for renal compared with cardiovascular outcomes, suggesting that albuminuria is a dominant risk marker for renal outcomes and may also contribute to cardiovascular risk in addition to classical risk markers, such as BP and cholesterol. Collectively, these data support implementation strategies to screen for elevated albuminuria in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, which remains suboptimal in many parts of the world. 29, 30, 31, 32

Albuminuria measurements show substantial day‐to‐day variability, 33, 34 in particular when assessed from random daytime urine samples as was done in the EMPA‐REG OUTCOME trial. The random measurement error that occurs may attenuate the observed strength of the association between albuminuria and outcomes. Indeed, after correction for regression‐dilution bias, the associations between albuminuria and adverse outcomes strengthened. Only a few other studies have considered regression‐dilution bias and unequivocally show stronger associations after its correction. 4, 35, 36 These results reinforce clinical practice guideline recommendations to use albuminuria measurements across multiple study visits to more precisely determine albuminuria change. 37

Empagliflozin reduces albuminuria and increases the likelihood of achieving a > 30% reduction in albuminuria after 12 weeks of treatment. The effect of empagliflozin on albuminuria was stronger in patients with micro‐ or macroalbuminuria at baseline, a finding observed with other SGLT2 inhibitors as well. 38, 39 Because albuminuria was affected by empagliflozin and because both baseline and short‐term changes in albuminuria were associated with cardiovascular and renal outcomes, albuminuria qualifies as a potential mediator of the effect of empagliflozin. The mediation analyses demonstrated that albuminuria mediated 15% to 30% of the treatment effect of empagliflozin. The mediating effect of albuminuria may be attributed to reductions in intraglomerular pressure secondary to restoration of tubuloglomerular feedback. Favorable effects on endothelial function and glycocalyx barrier function may also be involved and might potentially explain either or both the cardiovascular and renal benefits with empagliflozin. 40, 41, 42 Interestingly, mediating effects were larger in patients with micro‐ or macroalbuminuria compared with normoalbuminuria. This disparity suggests that the mechanisms of cardiovascular or renal protection may vary in importance between these subgroups. We recognize, however, that mediation analyses do not necessarily explain a drug's efficacy because they are observational analyses and are prone to confounding.

### Are the cardiovascular and kidney benefits of empagliflozin influenced by baseline glucose-lowering therapy? [^112k5ukV]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Aims

In the EMPA-REG OUTCOME® trial, the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor empagliflozin when given in addition to standard care improved cardiovascular (CV) and renal outcomes, and reduced mortality. Trial participants were on a variety of glucose-lowering therapies at baseline, some of which could potentially affect CV risk. This analysis investigated whether the use of background diabetes therapy affected the risk of CV death, hospitalizations for heart failure, and progression of chronic kidney disease, among patients treated with empagliflozin.

Materials and Methods

Patients meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria were randomized to placebo, empagliflozin 10mg or empagliflozin 25mg; glucose-lowering therapy was to remain unchanged for 12weeks and then adjusted to achieve glycaemic control according to local guidelines. Differences in risk of cardio-renal outcomes between empagliflozin and placebo by baseline use of metformin, sulphonylurea (SU) and insulin were assessed using a Cox proportional hazards model.

Results

Of 7020 eligible patients, 74% were receiving metformin, 43% SU and 48% insulin at baseline (each alone or in combination); the most common regimens were metformin plus SU (20%) and metformin plus insulin (20%). Empagliflozin reduced the risk of CV death irrespective of the use of: metformin [with: hazard ratio (HR) 0.71 (95% confidence interval, CI, 0.54–0.94); without: 0.46 (0.32–0.68); P interaction = 0.07]; SU [with: HR 0.64 (0.44–0.92); without: 0.61 (0.46–0.81); P interaction = 0.85]; or insulin [with: HR 0.63 (0.46–0.85); without: 0.61 (0.44–0.85); P interaction = 0.92]. Reductions in three-point major adverse CV events, hospitalizations for heart failure, and all-cause mortality were consistent across subgroups of baseline therapies. Empagliflozin reduced the risks of incident or worsening nephropathy versus placebo irrespective of the use of SU or insulin at baseline (P interaction > 0.05), but there was a greater reduction in this risk for patients not using metformin [HR 0.47 (95% CI 0.37–0.59)] versus those using metformin [HR 0.68 (95% CI 0.58–0.79)] at baseline (P interaction = 0.01).

Conclusions

The addition of empagliflozin to antihyperglycaemic regimens of patients with type 2 diabetes and CV disease consistently reduced their risks of adverse CV outcomes and mortality irrespective of baseline use of metformin, SU or insulin. For chronic kidney disease progression, there may be a larger benefit from empagliflozin in those patients who are not using metformin.

14.5 Empagliflozin Chronic Kidney Disease Trial, Including Adult Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus

The effectiveness of empagliflozin, a component of SYNJARDY and SYNJARDY XR, to reduce the risk of sustained decline in eGFR, end-stage kidney disease, CV death, and hospitalization has been established in adults with chronic kidney disease at risk of progression based on an adequate and well-controlled study of empagliflozin [EMPA-KIDNEY (NCT03594110)]. This trial was designed to determine the treatment effect of empagliflozin compared to placebo in adults with CKD (with and without type 2 diabetes). The trial, which studied empagliflozin rather than SYNJARDY or SYNJARDY XR, included adults taking metformin HCl as a concomitant medication. The efficacy results of EMPA-KIDNEY are reported below.

EMPA-KIDNEY was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in adults with chronic kidney disease [eGFR ≥ 20 to < 45 mL/min/1.73 m2; or eGFR ≥ 45 to < 90 mL/min/1.73 m2with urine albumin to creatinine ratio (UACR) ≥ 200 mg/g]. The trial excluded patients with polycystic kidney disease or patients requiring intravenous immunosuppressive therapy in the preceding three months or > 45 mg of prednisone (or equivalent) at the time of screening. The primary objective of the trial was to assess the effects of empagliflozin as an adjunct to standard of care therapy, including RAS-inhibitor therapy when appropriate, on time to kidney disease progression or CV death. A total of 6,609 patients, were equally randomized to empagliflozin 10 mg orally once-daily or placebo and were followed for a median of 24 months.

eGFR slopes

Details on a prespecified slope analysis have been reported recently. For slope analyses reported here, the main efficacy outcome was the average rate of change of eGFR in mL/min/1.73 m 2 per year during the trial period when participants received stable treatment with study drug (from week 4 until treatment cessation – i.e. the chronic treatment maintenance period). In addition, the average rate of change in eGFR per week in the first 4 weeks after treatment initiation (i.e. treatment initiation period) was assessed, as well as in the 30 days after stopping treatment (i.e. post-treatment cessation period).

Hypothetical time to projected ESKD

Among the subgroup of participants with NRP, based on results from the random-intercept random-coefficient model and utilising the individual participants' intercepts and slopes, we estimated the hypothetical time of reaching projected ESKD (defined as the time of first reaching eGFR-value ≤ 10 mL/min/1.73 m² that was maintained) if a patient does not die. Deaths occurring after hypothetically reaching ESKD were not considered for the primary ESKD evaluation, and any deaths occurring before projected ESKD were not accounted for.

We applied the random-intercept random-coefficient model to data from week 4 until treatment cessation and extrapolated the eGFR course, conditioning upon linearity, until 15 years from baseline. Hypothetical time to projected ESKD was determined by the individual intercept and slope for participants who reached it within 15 years. For all other NRP participants it was set to 15 years, assuming that any patient with a slower decline would have reached ESKD after 15 years, thereby potentially over-estimating the rate of ESKD particularly in the group with smaller eGFR decline (across both treatments), but to reflect the severe prognosis within this population studied. Any death in NRP patients within that 15-year time frame was not accounted for as a death-prediction was not performed. Comparison of the hypothetical time to projected ESKD between treatment groups was performed by providing median (interquartile range [IQR]) of individual participants' time and a log rank test.

### Design, recruitment, and baseline characteristics of the EMPA-KIDNEY trial [^1152jVa1]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

The design of EMPA-KIDNEY was finalized in 2018, before the results of CREDENCE and DAPA-CKD were known. The key objective was to assess the effect of empagliflozin on kidney disease progression in a wide range of people with CKD who were at risk of progression to ESKD, including people with or without DM and people with or without albuminuria. The rationale for testing empagliflozin in the full range of people at risk of CKD progression was based on findings from the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial and other clinical and experimental data, which showed SGLT-2 inhibitors induce glycosuria and lower BP and albuminuria. An acute dip in eGFR on commencing an SGLT-2 inhibitor is observed, which results from the modulation of renal tubuloglomerular feedback through decreased proximal tubular sodium resorption and subsequent glomerular afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction. Such an effect could decrease glomerular barotrauma resulting from hyperfiltration induced by diabetes, obesity or decreased nephron number (i.e. in people with low eGFR). EMPA-REG OUTCOME data also raised the hypothesis — which has recently been confirmed in the EMPEROR trials — that empagliflozin has the potential to prevent or treat the particular types of heart disease experienced by people with CKD. Further details of EMPA-KIDNEY's rationale are described in a separate publication. Establishing definitive evidence of safety and efficacy in the full range of people with CKD with and without DM has particular public health importance as, worldwide, 50–70% of people with CKD do not have DM. In this article we describe the design, recruitment and baseline characteristics of the EMPA-KIDNEY trial and put this information in the context of other published trial data.

### Editorial: the role of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors in the management of chronic kidney disease [^116LNTwJ]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

One of the alleged pathways by which SGLT2 inhibitors slow progression of CKD is correction of hyperfiltration. Since the long-term benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors are unlikely mediated by reductions in HbA1c and various types of kidney diseases are characterized by hyperfiltration, it is tempting to speculate on the role of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with CKD without type 2 diabetes, as reviewed by Dekkers and Gansevoort. Previous studies have indeed suggested that the pharmacodynamic activity persists in non-diabetic conditions. For example, in nearly 400 obese individuals, canagliflozin reduced body weight, blood pressure and uric acid. Moreover, in 10 patients with focal segmental glomerular sclerosis, reductions in both numerical and measured proteinuria were noted, although these did not reach statistical significance. Further mechanistic and clinical outcome trials are ongoing in patients with CKD. The Dapagliflozin and Prevention of Adverse Outcomes in CKD trial assesses the effect of the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin on kidney and cardiovascular events in patients with CKD with and without diabetes. The rationale and the design of the trial are described in this month's issue of NDT. The Empagliflozin Kidney (EMPA-KIDNEY) trial is another large clinical trial to assess the efficacy of empagliflozin on major kidney outcomes. The results will increase our understanding about the position of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with CKD without diabetes.

Should SGLT2 inhibitors be prescribed to any patients with type 2 diabetes and CKD? It is possible that some patients do not tolerate these drugs or use concomitant medications, such as renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors or loop diuretics that may impact the efficacy or safety of SGLT2 inhibitors. These questions are discussed by Neuen et al. in this NDT supplement.

After more than a century of research into the physiology of tubular glucose reabsorption, we are now entering a new era of kidney protection with proven effective therapeutic approaches that prevent clinically important outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes. It is now up to the nephrology community to implement these treatments in clinical practice.

### Effectiveness… [^112LVGFB]. AAFP (2016). Low credibility.

1 and diabetic ketoacidosis without high blood glucose levels. 2 Other rare serious adverse effects include hypovolemia and hypotension. Although infrequent, severe hypoglycemia may occur in patients taking multiple-dose injection insulin. Mild or moderate hypoglycemia occurs most often when combining empagliflozin with any insulin and less often with sulfonylureas. EFFECTIVENESS Empagliflozin may reduce mortality in patients with diabetes who are at high risk of cardiovascular death. One study that added empagliflozin or placebo to existing type 2 diabetes treatment in older patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease demonstrated lower all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and hospitalization for heart failure in the empagliflozin group vs.

the placebo group. Patients with type 2 diabetes who are taking empagliflozin will lose an average of 2% body weight, and the medication will induce further weight loss in patients already treated with linagliptin. When used alone, empagliflozin decreases hemoglobin A1C levels by 0. 7 to
0. 9 percentage points, with only a small increase in effect with the higher dose. When added to other antidiabetic agents, empagliflozin produces an additional average A1C decrease of 0. 6 percentage points. Its effectiveness decreases in patients with lower renal function, and it is not effective in patients with a glomerular filtration rate of less than 45 mL per minute. Bottom Line Empagliflozin can be added to existing type 2 diabetes treatment to lower A1C levels, although there are less expensive options.

In older patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease, empagliflozin can decrease all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and hospitalization for heart failure.

### Choice of endpoint in kidney outcome trials: considerations from the EMPA-REG OUTCOME® trial [^115C4GSa]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Doubling of serum creatinine [equivalent to 57% reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)] is an established surrogate for end-stage kidney disease (ESKD); however, this endpoint necessitates lengthy follow-up and large sample sizes in clinical trials. We explored whether alternative eGFR decline thresholds provide more feasible surrogate kidney endpoints.

Methods

The study involved post hoc analysis of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME® trial. Adults with type 2 diabetes, high cardiovascular risk and eGFR ≥ 30mL/min/1.73 m2 were assigned empagliflozin 10mg or 25mg (n = 4687) or placebo (n = 2333), on top of standard of care. We assessed composite endpoints incorporating different eGFR decline thresholds (≥ 30, ≥ 40, ≥ 50 or ≥ 57%) combined with initiation of renal replacement therapy (RRT) or renal death. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01131676).

Results

Empagliflozin versus placebo significantly lowered the risk of decline in eGFR for each threshold listed above, combined with initiation of RRT or renal death, ranging from a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.81 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72–0.91] for endpoints based on 30% eGFR decline to an HR of 0.37 (0.23–0.61) for endpoints based on 57% eGFR decline. Lower thresholds (e.g. 30%) were associated with higher event rates but weaker treatment effects. The time to the 95% CI of the HR falling to < 1.0 decreased with increasing eGFR threshold.

Conclusions

The composite of 40% decline in eGFR, ESKD or renal death appears to provide reliable results similar to the traditional 57% decline in eGFR.

### Safety and efficacy of dapagliflozin in patients with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis: a prespecified analysis of the dapagliflozin and prevention of adverse outcomes in chronic kidney disease (DAPA-CKD) trial [^113gFucd]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is clinically characterized by proteinuria, hypertension and progressive loss of kidney function. The incidence of FSGS has been estimated between 0.2 and 1.8/100000 population/year. FSGS is caused by a number of diseases and is characterized by the damage of podocytes. The traditional classification is into primary FSGS and adaptive (or secondary) FSGS, the latter thought to result from excess nephron workload as occurs in obesity or following a reduction in the nephron number. This simplistic classification is becoming outdated as additional causes of FSGS, including genetic mutations, viral infections and medications, are recognized. Treatment of FSGS depends on the aetiology and severity, with immunosuppression usually offered to patients with primary disease and supportive therapies including renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) blockade for those with the adaptive form. There are no disease-specific therapies that have been approved by regulatory authorities, partly because no large-scale randomized clinical trials have demonstrated benefits on 'hard outcomes' such as a reduction in the risk of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) with any therapeutic intervention. Use of a surrogate endpoint such as change in albuminuria or an intermediate endpoint such as change in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) slope has recently been advocated as a means to enhance feasibility of clinical trials in patients with specific and uncommon kidney diseases in whom traditional clinical endpoints rarely occur and is an approach that has been adopted in ongoing trials in FSGS.

Dapagliflozin is a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor that reduces glucose reabsorption in the proximal convoluted tubule of the kidney, thereby enhancing urinary glucose excretion. Developed to improve glycaemic control in patients with diabetes, the SGLT2 inhibitors empagliflozin, canagliflozin, dapagliflozin and ertugliflozin slowed the rate of decline of eGFR and reduced albuminuria in cardiovascular safety trials involving participants with type 2 diabetes. Clinical studies in type 1 and type 2 diabetes have shown early reversible reductions in eGFR and reductions in albuminuria following initiation of SGLT2 inhibitors, even in participants with good glycaemic control, suggesting that SGLT2 inhibitors reduce intraglomerular pressure, which may in the long-term preserve kidney function. This same effect has also been observed in nondiabetic patients with proteinuric CKD, providing a rationale for the use of these agents as renoprotective therapies in patients with CKD due to causes other than diabetes.

### SGLT2 inhibitors: cardiovascular benefits beyond HbA1c-translating evidence into practice [^1131uotf]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Although SGLT2i treatments have a reduced glucose-lowering effect in people with reduced renal function, the renal benefits of SGLT2i agents appear to be preserved among people both with and without chronic kidney disease (CKD); these benefits include significant reduction in albuminuria and reduced incidence of worsening albuminuria. The benefits on CVD outcomes with empagliflozin and canagliflozin have been demonstrated in patients with a range of baseline renal function capacities and across a range of urine albumin–creatinine ratios; the effects of dapagliflozin were similarly observed across a range of baseline eGFR values. Currently, SGLT2i treatment is indicated for initiation in people with T2DM and an eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and should be discontinued if eGFR persistently falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2. The preserved efficacy of SGLT2 inhibition across a range of degrees of renal impairment may be of importance in treatment selection for people with T2DM, because CKD and T2DM are both associated with increased CV risk.

The efficacy of SGLT2i treatment will be further elucidated in the forthcoming Canagliflozin and Renal Endpoints in Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation (CREDENCE) trial (unpublished at time of paper development), which will prospectively assess the efficacy and safety of canagliflozin in clinically important renal and CV outcomes. The primary composite endpoint is time to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), doubling of serum creatinine, and renal or CV death. At a planned interim analysis, the CREDENCE study demonstrated efficacy in achieving this primary endpoint and as a result the trial was stopped early. Secondary endpoints include a CV composite endpoint of CV death, non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, hospitalisation for chronic HF and hospitalisation for unstable angina.

### Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors: extending the indication to non-diabetic kidney disease? [^116oZXu3]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

Six to 10 years ago, Phase 2 and 3 studies already showed that SGLT2 inhibitors not only lowered plasma glucose, but also decreased blood pressure, body weight (BW) and proteinuria. The recent large cardiovascular outcome trials Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients (EMPA-REG OUTCOME) with EMPA, CANagliflozin cardioVascular Assessment Study (CANVAS) with CANA and Multicenter Trial to Evaluate the Effect of Dapagliflozin on the Incidence of Cardiovascular Events (DECLARE-TIMI58 with DAPA reproduced these beneficial effects and also showed that SGLT2 inhibitors lowered the risk for renal events by 34–47%, the risk for cardiovascular events by 7–14% and the risk for hospitalization for heart failure by ∼30% (Table 1). Renal events were defined differently in these three trials as a composite of incidence of kidney replacement therapy/end-stage kidney disease or renal- or cardiovascular death, combined in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME and CANVAS trials with progression to macroalbuminuria and/or doubling of serum creatinine and in the DECLARE-TIMI58 trial with a 40% reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (Table 1). The results obtained in these trials were very promising. However, they were not designed to examine changes in renal outcomes, but to test cardiovascular safety in a non-inferiority design compared with placebo. Therefore specific, well-powered renal outcomes trials were launched and small-scale mechanistic studies were initiated to obtain more insight into the underlying renoprotective mechanisms.

Table 1
Summary of outcome trials with SGLT2 inhibitors

This review will focus on the effects and the use of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). We will elaborate on the mechanisms underlying the renoprotective effects and question whether, based on these mechanisms, SGLT2 inhibitors might also be indicated for non-diabetic patients with a CKD.

### Real-time use of SGLT2i verified in pre-dialysis: the RSVP cross-sectional study [^114Qhudb]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an irreversible health condition that affects approximately 1 in 10 Canadians. As the Canadian population continues to age, its prevalence is bound to increase along with its numerous comorbidities and health care burden. Until recently, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) were the only pharmacological intervention recommended to slow the decline of the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) independent of blood pressure control, albeit in patients with diabetes or those with proteinuria. Nonetheless, eGFR will continue to decline with pharmacotherapy, and not all patients are candidates for ACEi or ARBs.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) have increasingly become standard of care to slow the progression of CKD. In 2019, the Canagliflozin and Renal Endpoints in Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation (CREDENCE) trial demonstrated a reduction in composite outcome of kidney failure, doubling of serum creatinine, or kidney or cardiovascular (CV)-related death irrespective of HbA1c improvement in patients with diabetes with proteinuria. In 2020, the Dapagliflozin and Prevention of Adverse Outcomes in CKD (DAPA-CKD) trial would increase the eligibility to non-diabetic patients with CKD and proteinuria with an eGFR down to 25 mL/min/1.73 m 2. Finally in 2022, the Empagliflozin in Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease (EMPA-KIDNEY) trial proved that patients with an eGFR down to 20 mL/min/1.73 m 2, regardless of proteinuria, could also be prescribed an SGLT2i to lower the risk of progression of kidney disease and reduce CV-related death.

### Impact of diabetes on the effects of sodium glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors on kidney outcomes: collaborative meta-analysis of large placebo-controlled trials [^117AeSck]. Lancet (2022). Excellent credibility.

Based on the average risk in different trial populations, we estimated that for every 1000 patients with chronic kidney disease treated for one year with an SGLT2 inhibitor, 11 first kidney disease progression events would be prevented in patients with diabetes, and 15 would be prevented in patients without diabetes. In these patients, such treatment also appeared to result in an estimated four to five fewer acute kidney injury events in patients with and without diabetes. Individual trials have shown that kidney benefits translate into important reductions in the need for dialysis or kidney transplantation, and the cardiovascular and kidney benefits appear to be cost-saving in diabetic chronic kidney disease. We found no good evidence that the kidney benefits were modified by the average level of kidney function studied in the trials. Importantly, efficacy and safety data from EMPA-KIDNEY and DAPA-CKD combined include information on nearly 3000 patients with an eGFR of 20–30 mL/min per 1.73 m 2. A total of 489 kidney disease progression outcomes accrued in those with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 in those two trials. Although some clinical practice guidelines have started recommending use of SGLT2 inhibitors in type 2 diabetes at eGFRs down to 20 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 (based on grade B levels of evidence), many other recommendations limit initiation to those with eGFR greater than 25 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 or 30 mL/min per 1.73 m 2. As patients with decreased eGFR are at the highest absolute risk of kidney disease progression, our findings should encourage the initiation of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with chronic kidney disease down to an eGFR of 20 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 with continued use below this level. Several hundred participants in the chronic kidney disease trials had an eGFR below 20 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 at randomisation or during follow-up (eg, 254 participants in EMPA-KIDNEY at randomisation), providing indirect evidence to support initiation of SGLT2 inhibitors in selected patients with an eGFR less than 20 mL/min per 1.73 m 2.

### The cardiovascular outcomes, heart failure and kidney disease trials tell that the time to use sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors is now [^1112gD1P]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

The CVOTs reported to date include empagliflozin's EMPA‐REG Outcome, 10 canagliflozin's integrated CANVAS Program 11 (comprised of two trials: CANVAS and CANVAS‐R), dapagliflozin's DECLARE‐TIMI‐58 12 and ertugliflozin's VERTIS‐CV. 13 The EMPA‐REG OUTCOME trial, 10, 14 demonstrated superiority of empagliflozin for the three‐point major cardiovascular event (MACE‐3: a composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction [MI] or nonfatal stroke), with significantly lower rates of cardiovascular death, hospitalization for heart failure (HHF), all cause death and kidney outcomes. Similar to empagliflozin, canagliflozin 11 was demonstrated to be superior to placebo for the MACE‐3. On the other hand, dapagliflozin 12 and ertugliflozin 13 only achieved non‐inferiority in their respective cardiovascular safety trials, DECLARE‐TIMI‐58 and VERTIS‐CV.

DAPA‐HF 15 and EMPEROR‐reduced 16 recruited patients with or without T2D but with reduced ejection fraction (EF < 35%). Both studies showed highly significant reductions in the primary outcome of HHF or cardiovascular death irrespective of baseline kidney function, proteinuria, gender, race, diabetic status. CREDENCE 17 and DAPA‐CKD 18 examined the effects of canagliflozin and dapagliflozin in patients with persistent kidney damage, that is, persistent macroalbuminuria and impaired eGFR (between 30 and 90 ml/min/1.73 m 2) on a background of maximally tolerated therapy with RASi. While CREDENCE recruited patients with type 2 diabetes, DAPA‐CKD also included patients without T2D. These CKD trials not only demonstrated that the drugs reduced a composite that involved worsening kidney function, the need for dialysis, and reduced cardiovascular outcomes.

The rapidly expanding landscape of the SGLT2i trials can be rather daunting to follow, given the variable study designs, populations, and the sequential testing strategy employed by the study authors. There remains understandable confusion about the relative merits of one SGLT2i versus another since individual study results tend to be presented as "significant" or "nonsignificant" without consideration of the totality of evidence across trials. In the present meta‐analysis we will synthesize the primary outcomes and the high‐profile adverse events, which to the authors' opinion seem to act as a barrier against the wider adoption of the SGLT2i.

### Cardiovascular effects of dapagliflozin by baseline kidney function and albuminuria status in diabetes… [^116C5ka2]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

The goal of the present analyses was to examine the efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin according to baseline eGFR and albuminuria status. The composites of CV death or HHF and of MACE were used as the primary efficacy outcomes of interest. Additional outcomes were the individual components of the composite outcomes as well as all-cause death. The mean changes in eGFR, blood pressure, and glycated hemoglobin level over time and the differences between dapagliflozin and placebo during the trial were assessed using least-squares mean values and tested for interactions between subgroups at 6 months. Cox regression models with interaction testing were used to test the heterogeneity of the relative treatment effect across the subgroups. At 6 months, the extent of HbA1c reduction with dapagliflozin was significantly smaller in patients with lower baseline eGFR compared with patients with more preserved kidney function (least-squares mean absolute difference at 6 months: −0.

39 [95% CI, −0. 52 to. The results from the present analyses of the DECLARE-TIMI 58 trial showed largely consistent relative risk reductions with dapagliflozin in CV events irrespective of baseline eGFR and albuminuria status in a broad population of patients with type 2 diabetes who had or were at risk for ASCVD. However, patients with more markers of CKD derived a significantly greater absolute risk reduction for the composite of CV death or HHF, reflecting a consistent effect in the context of their higher baseline risk, and with a clear disconnect between CV efficacy and measures of glucose control. Initial concerns about the glucose-lowering efficacy of dapagliflozin in patients with a lower eGFR led to requested modifications of the DECLARE-TIMI 58 trial protocol by the US Food and Drug Administration to exclude patients with a creatinine clearance below 60 mL/min at screening.

However, these regulations were established because of attenuated urinary glucosuria and thus lower efficacy in HbA1c reductions in those patients and not because of safety concerns. In the DECLARE-TIMI 58 trial, we observed lower, albeit still significant, reductions in HbA1c levels in patients with a lower baseline eGFR compared with patients who had more preserved baseline kidney function, whereas the magnitude in blood pressure and body mass index reductions were consistent irrespective of baseline kidney function, suggesting that these effects are mediated through nondiuretic mechanisms.

### Nephrotic-range proteinuria in type 2 diabetes: effects of empagliflozin on kidney disease progression and clinical outcomes [^115fLp8E]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have a kidney-targeted mechanism of action and have been shown to have nephroprotective effects, specifically in albuminuric patients. Up to December 2017, there was no evidence on their efficacy in patients with NRP, but in a clinical case report, tofogliflozin was able to substantially reduce NRP in a patient with T2DM over 24 weeks of treatment.

In EMPA-REG OUTCOME, empagliflozin, in addition to significantly reducing the risk of cardiovascular (CV) death and heart failure hospitalisation, decreased clinically relevant kidney outcomes by 39% in participants with T2DM and established cardiovascular disease (CVD), and by 47% in the participants with heart failure. These findings are consistent with data from other SGLT2 inhibitors such as canagliflozin and dapagliflozin in patients with T2DM and CVD or CV risk. Most recently, canagliflozin and dapagliflozin have also been shown to reduce CV and kidney events in patients with albuminuric chronic kidney disease (CKD), regardless of coexisting diabetes. In the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial, participants were followed over a median observation period of 3.1 years. As no restrictions for albuminuria were applied at inclusion, it was also possible to study participants with albuminuria values in the nephrotic range. We therefore aimed to evaluate the potential of empagliflozin to slow kidney disease progression and to improve overall clinical outcomes burden in individuals with T2DM complicated by the presence of NRP, using data from EMPA-REG OUTCOME.

### Consistent effects of empagliflozin on cardiovascular and kidney outcomes irrespective of diabetic kidney disease categories: insights from the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial [^113LA1up]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Aim

To explore the cardiovascular (CV) and kidney effects of empagliflozin in patients with different clinical phenotypes of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) (i.e. with the presence or absence of overt albuminuria) participating in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial.

Materials and Methods

EMPA-REG OUTCOME randomized participants (1:1:1) to empagliflozin 10 mg, 25mg or placebo, added to standard of care. Post hoc, patients with different clinical phenotypes of DKD at baseline were categorized in three subgroups: (a) overt DKD (overt albuminuria [urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio of > 300mg/g] with any estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]; n = 769); (b) non-overt DKD (kidney impairment [eGFR < 60mL/min/1.73m 2] without overt albuminuria [urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio of ≤ 300mg/g]; n = 1290); and (c) 'all others' (eGFR ≥ 60mL/min/1.73m 2 without overt albuminuria; n = 4893). Analyses included CV (death, hospitalization for heart failure, all-cause hospitalization) and selected kidney outcomes, change in eGFR and kidney safety. Cox proportional hazards models assessed the consistency of treatment effect across subgroups.

Results

Empagliflozin significantly reduced the risk of CV and kidney outcomes across all subgroups (P-values for interaction > .05), consistent with the overall trial population findings. Empagliflozin also significantly reduced the yearly loss of eGFR, assessed by chronic slopes, in all subgroups. The adverse event profile of empagliflozin was similar across all subgroups.

Conclusions

Empagliflozin may improve CV and kidney outcomes and slow the progression of kidney disease in type 2 diabetes patients with DKD, irrespective of its clinical form, both with or without the presence of overt albuminuria.

Effectiveness of SGLT2i in Ameliorating Albuminuria

In the EMPA-REG CVOT trial, 80.7% of the patients were taking ACE-Is or ARBs at baseline and had controlled blood pressure. Incident or worsening nephropathy was reduced by 39% in the empagliflozin arm compared to placebo, with the renal effects of empagliflozin evident even in patients on RAAS blockers. This finding supports the potential use of empagliflozin in combination with RAAS blockers in people with T2DM and CKD. In accordance with an exploratory analysis of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial, patients treated with empagliflozin were more likely to experience a sustained improvement from microalbuminuria to normoalbuminuria (HR 1.43, 95% CI 1.22–1.67, p < 0.0001) or from macroalbuminuria to microalbuminuria or normoalbuminuria (HR 1.82, 95% CI 1.40–2.37, p < 0.0001) and less likely to experience a sustained deterioration from normoalbuminuria to microalbuminuria or macroalbuminuria (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.74–0.95, p = 0.0077). Moreover, the decrease in urine ACR was evident since week 12 of the treatment. In the dapagliflozin phase II/III trial, overall, 17.8, 18.9, and 7.0% of patients improved to normoalbuminuria status in the dapagliflozin 10 mg and 5 mg groups and placebo group, respectively. Similarly, in a pooled analysis of phase III dapagliflozin trials, greater 12-week reductions in albuminuria (− 33.2%, 95% CI − 45.4 to − 18.2) compared with placebo was evident. The reduction in albuminuria was also present after adjusting for age, sex, changes in HbA1c, systolic blood pressure, body weight, and eGFR, i.e. − 23.5% (95% CI − 37.6 to − 6.3). A meta-analysis of 47 RCTs of SGLT2i in 22,843 people with T2DM having CKD reported a significant reduction in urine ACR (weighted mean difference − 107.35 mg/g, 95% CI − 192.53 to − 22.18). These results support the use of SGLT2i in people with T2DM and CKD, irrespective of the patients' albuminuria status at baseline and even in patients with normoalbuminuria to prevent progression to micro- or macroalbuminuria. Canagliflozin prevented the progression of albuminuria by 27% (HR 0.73; CI 0.67–0.79) and induced regression of albuminuria more frequently in the trial participants (HR 1.70; 95% CI 1.51–1.91). Table 1 shows the renoprotective effects of SGLT2 inhibitors.

### Empagliflozin and clinical outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, established cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease [^111bj58s]. Circulation (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Empagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor, reduced cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and established cardiovascular disease in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial (Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients). Urinary glucose excretion with empagliflozin decreases with declining renal function, resulting in less potency for glucose lowering in patients with kidney disease. We investigated the effects of empagliflozin on clinical outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, established cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease.

Methods

Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, established cardiovascular disease, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 30 mL·min -1 ·1.73 m -2 at screening were randomized to receive empagliflozin 10 mg, empagliflozin 25 mg, or placebo once daily in addition to standard of care. We analyzed cardiovascular death, hospitalization for heart failure, all-cause hospitalization, and all-cause mortality in patients with prevalent kidney disease (defined as eGFR < 60 mL·min -1 ·1.73 m -2 and/or urine albumin-creatinine ratio > 300 mg/g) at baseline. Additional analyses were performed in subgroups by baseline eGFR (< 45, 45- < 60, 60- < 90, ≥ 90 mL·min -1 ·1.73 m -2) and baseline urine albumin-creatinine ratio (> 300, 30- ≤ 300, < 30 mg/g).

Results

Of 7020 patients treated, 2250 patients had prevalent kidney disease at baseline, of whom 67% had a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus for > 10 years, 58% were receiving insulin, and 84% were taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers. In patients with prevalent kidney disease at baseline, empagliflozin reduced the risk of cardiovascular death by 29% compared with placebo (hazard ratio [HR], 0.71; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.52–0.98), the risk of all-cause mortality by 24% (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.59–0.99), the risk of hospitalization for heart failure by 39% (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.42–0.87), and the risk of all-cause hospitalization by 19% (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.72–0.92). Effects of empagliflozin on these outcomes were consistent across categories of eGFR and urine albumin-creatinine ratio at baseline and across the 2 doses studied. The adverse event profile of empagliflozin in patients with eGFR < 60 mL·min -1 ·1.73 m -2 was consistent with the overall trial population.

Conclusions

Empagliflozin improved clinical outcomes and reduced mortality in vulnerable patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, established cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease.

### Empagliflozin and progression of kidney disease in type 2 diabetes [^116BsyB6]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2016). Excellent credibility.

Background

Diabetes confers an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular and renal events. In the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial, empagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor, reduced the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes at high risk for cardiovascular events. We wanted to determine the long-term renal effects of empagliflozin, an analysis that was a prespecified component of the secondary microvascular outcome of that trial.

Methods

We randomly assigned patients with type 2 diabetes and an estimated glomerular filtration rate of at least 30 mL per minute per 1.73 m² of body-surface area to receive either empagliflozin (at a dose of 10 mg or 25 mg) or placebo once daily. Prespecified renal outcomes included incident or worsening nephropathy (progression to macroalbuminuria, doubling of the serum creatinine level, initiation of renal-replacement therapy, or death from renal disease) and incident albuminuria.

Results

Incident or worsening nephropathy occurred in 525 of 4124 patients (12.7%) in the empagliflozin group and in 388 of 2061 (18.8%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio in the empagliflozin group, 0.61; 95% confidence interval, 0.53 to 0.70; P < 0.001). Doubling of the serum creatinine level occurred in 70 of 4645 patients (1.5%) in the empagliflozin group and in 60 of 2323 (2.6%) in the placebo group, a significant relative risk reduction of 44%. Renal-replacement therapy was initiated in 13 of 4687 patients (0.3%) in the empagliflozin group and in 14 of 2333 patients (0.6%) in the placebo group, representing a 55% lower relative risk in the empagliflozin group. There was no significant between-group difference in the rate of incident albuminuria. The adverse-event profile of empagliflozin in patients with impaired kidney function at baseline was similar to that reported in the overall trial population.

Conclusions

In patients with type 2 diabetes at high cardiovascular risk, empagliflozin was associated with slower progression of kidney disease and lower rates of clinically relevant renal events than was placebo when added to standard care. (Funded by the Boehringer Ingelheim and Eli Lilly and Company Diabetes Alliance; EMPA-REG OUTCOME ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01131676.).

### Pharmacologic approaches to glycemic treatment: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^114xfYwD]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) in type 2 diabetes — SGLT2 inhibitors have kidney and cardiovascular benefits, but their glucose-lowering effect decreases at low estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and CKD increases hypoglycemia risk requiring careful monitoring with insulin or sulfonylureas. Dedicated kidney outcomes trials in people with CKD and type 2 diabetes have shown that the SGLT2 inhibitors empagliflozin, canagliflozin, and dapagliflozin have beneficial effects on slowing progression of CKD and CV outcomes. However, their ability to lower glucose levels declines when the eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m^2. A secondary analysis of the GRADE trial found that insulin glargine, liraglutide, sitagliptin, and glimepiride did not prevent CKD when added to metformin in those without underlying CKD. Individuals with CKD are at high risk for hypoglycemia, and if treated with insulin and/or sulfonylureas, treatment needs close monitoring and adjustment as eGFR declines with education on hypoglycemia occurrence.

### SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin: finally at the latter stage of understanding? [^114tsbQo]. Kidney International (2018). Low credibility.

Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors are a relatively new adjunctive treatment option for type 2 diabetes (T2D). Extraglycemic benefits of sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibition include weight and blood pressure reduction. Cherney et al. now demonstrate that these extraglycemic properties of empagliflozin are preserved despite reduced urinary glucose excretion in advancing chronic kidney disease. Limited therapeutic options for patients with type 2 diabetes in the latter stages of chronic kidney disease make empagliflozin an attractive therapeutic agent with additional cardiovascular benefits.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus [^114B1dND]. VA/DoD (2023). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease — renal outcome benefits of SGLT‑2 inhibitors are supported by two large systematic reviews showing reduction versus placebo by 38% (HR: 0.62; 95% CI: 0.56–0.70), with results consistent across subgroups by baseline ASCVD, albuminuria, HF, T2DM, and CKD; in included trials the majority (> 80%) used ACEi or ARB at baseline, and across cardiovascular outcomes trials most patients (74% or more) had an eGFR of at least 60 mL/min/173m2 and 7–11% had macroalbuminuria; in individual RCTs canagliflozin reduced ESRD or renal mortality in pooled CANVAS and CREDENCE (HR: 0.64; 95% CI: 0.54–0.75), dapagliflozin reduced a primary composite in DAPA-CKD [eGFR 25–75 mL/min/1.73m2; UACR 200–5000 mg/g] (HR: 0.61; 95% CI: 0.51–0.72), and empagliflozin reduced a similar composite in EMPA-KIDNEY (eGFR 20–45 mL/min/1.73m2 or eGFR 45–90 with UACR ≥ 200) (HR: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.64–0.82), whereas no statistically significant benefit was seen with ertugliflozin, collectively indicating that select SGLT‑2 inhibitors improve renal outcomes in patients with T2DM, with and without CKD.

### American association of clinical endocrinology clinical practice guideline: developing a diabetes mellitus comprehensive care plan-2022 update [^114XTVb7]. Endocrine Practice (2022). High credibility.

Sodium–glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) — cardiorenal effects and prioritization — are summarized, noting that SGLT2is "continue to exert their renal protective benefit for those with low eGFRs (eg, < 45 mL/min/1.73 m^2)" and "modestly increase LDL-C levels (4 to 8 mg/dL)". Cardiovascular outcome trials report "Empagliflozin and canagliflozin demonstrated reduction in MACE in CVOTs; empagliflozin also demonstrated decreased CV death and all-cause mortality" and "Empagliflozin, canagliflozin, and ertugliflozin have shown a decrease in hospitalization for HF in their CVOTs". Regulatory indications include that "the FDA has given canagliflozin an indication to reduce the risk of end-stage kidney disease, doubling of serum creatinine, CV death, and hospitalization for HF in adults with T2D and diabetic nephropathy with albuminuria" and "Dapagliflozin based on the DAPA-CKD RCT has received an FDA indication to reduce the risk of sustained eGFR decline, end-stage kidney disease, CV death, and hospitalization for HF in adults with CKD at risk of progression". Consequently, "individuals with T2D at significant risk for or with established ASCVD, HF, and/or CKD should be treated with a GLP-1 RA or SGLT2i with proven benefit for the individual's specific conditions".

### Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors in the treatment of diabetes mellitus: cardiovascular and kidney effects, potential mechanisms, and clinical applications [^113ifqV2]. Circulation (2016). Low credibility.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, including empagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and canagliflozin, are now widely approved antihyperglycemic therapies. Because of their unique glycosuric mechanism, SGLT2 inhibitors also reduce weight. Perhaps more important are the osmotic diuretic and natriuretic effects contributing to plasma volume contraction, and decreases in systolic and diastolic blood pressures by 4 to 6 and 1 to 2 mmHg, respectively, which may underlie cardiovascular and kidney benefits. SGLT2 inhibition also is associated with an acute, dose-dependent reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate by ≈5 mL·min(-1)·1.73 m(-2) and ≈30% to 40% reduction in albuminuria. These effects mirror preclinical observations suggesting that proximal tubular natriuresis activates renal tubuloglomerular feedback through increased macula densa sodium and chloride delivery, leading to afferent vasoconstriction. On the basis of reduced glomerular filtration, glycosuric and weight loss effects are attenuated in patients with chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL·min(-1)·1.73 m(-2)). In contrast, blood pressure lowering, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and albuminuric effects are preserved, and perhaps exaggerated in chronic kidney disease. With regard to long-term clinical outcomes, the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial (Empagliflozin, Cardiovascular Outcomes, and Mortality in Type 2 Diabetes) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and established cardiovascular disease randomly assigned to empagliflozin versus placebo reported a 14% reduction in the primary composite outcome of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, and > 30% reductions in cardiovascular mortality, overall mortality, and heart failure hospitalizations associated with empagliflozin, even though, by design, the hemoglobin A1c difference between the randomized groups was marginal. Aside from an increased risk of mycotic genital infections, empagliflozin-treated patients had fewer serious adverse events, including a lower risk of acute kidney injury. In light of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME results, some diabetes clinical practice guidelines now recommend that SGLT2 inhibitors with proven cardiovascular benefit be prioritized in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who have not achieved glycemic targets and who have prevalent atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. With additional cardiorenal protection trials underway, sodium-related physiological effects of SGLT2 inhibitors and clinical correlates of natriuresis, such as the impact on blood pressure, heart failure, kidney protection, and mortality, will be a major management focus.

### Short-term changes in albuminuria and risk of cardiovascular and renal outcomes in type 2 diabetes mellitus: a post hoc analysis of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial [^115T3YYD]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus face a high risk of cardiovascular disease and progressive renal function loss despite stringent glycemic, blood pressure (BP), and lipid control. 1, 2 Albuminuria is a strong predictor of long‐term adverse cardiovascular and renal outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. 3, 4, 5, 6 Previous studies have shown that various interventions, including renin‐angiotensin‐aldosterone system inhibitors, decrease albuminuria and that the degree of albuminuria reduction during the first months of treatment is associated with a reduction in the risk of cardiovascular and renal outcomes. 5, 7, 8 This consistent finding, confirmed in various patient populations, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 supports regular monitoring of albuminuria to assess cardiovascular and renal prognosis. However, most of the evidence on associations between treatment effect on changes in albuminuria and clinical outcomes is derived from clinical trials with drugs that modulate the renin‐angiotensin‐aldosterone system. Whether drugs that reduce albuminuria but do not directly modulate the renin‐angiotensin‐aldosterone system have a similar association is not clear.

Empagliflozin is a selective inhibitor of SGLT2 (sodium‐glucose cotransporter 2), which reduces hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus by inhibiting the reabsorption of glucose in the proximal tubule, thereby increasing urinary glucose excretion. 14, 15 Previous studies with empagliflozin demonstrated improvements in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), BP, body weight, and albuminuria and reductions in cardiovascular and renal risks. 16, 17, 18

In this post hoc analysis of the EMPA‐REG OUTCOME (Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 diabetes Mellitus Patients) trial, we investigated whether an early change in albuminuria upon treatment with empagliflozin is associated with long‐term cardiovascular and renal outcomes and whether this association is independent of the change in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and other cardiovascular risk factors.
