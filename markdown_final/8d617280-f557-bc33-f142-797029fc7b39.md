## Question

Why do you vaccinate for hepatitis b if you have already passed it to your child

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why we still vaccinate a child for hepatitis B when the mother has already passed HBV to the child. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the timing of HBV transmission and the window for prevention. Then, I should verify the effectiveness of the birth dose plus HBIG in preventing perinatal infection. Next, I will examine the consequences of perinatal infection and the limits of passive maternal antibodies. After that, I need to check the long-term durability of vaccine-induced protection and whether boosters are needed. Finally, I will consider special situations like vaccine nonresponse and summarize the clinical rationale with guideline alignment.

> Let me first confirm the timing of transmission. Most perinatal HBV transmission occurs during labor and delivery, with rare in utero transmission, so the infant is often exposed at birth even if the mother is known to be HBsAg-positive, which means there is a narrow window immediately after birth to interrupt infection before it becomes chronic [^b782bdc7] [^8cc07abf].

> Wait, let me verify the effectiveness of immediate prophylaxis. Giving the hepatitis B vaccine within 24 hours of birth, preferably within 12 hours, plus hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) for infants of HBsAg-positive mothers, reduces perinatal transmission by about 90–98%, and this is the cornerstone of prevention even when maternal infection is known in advance [^5c87ceca] [^83463b3f] [^365f4b2f].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about passive immunity. Maternal anti-HBs crosses the placenta but wanes within months and does not provide durable protection, so relying on maternal antibodies alone leaves the infant vulnerable to chronic infection, which is why active immunization with the vaccine series is still required [^notfound].

> I need to check the consequences of perinatal infection. Infants infected at birth have an 80–90% risk of chronic HBV, compared with 30–50% if infected before age 5 and 1–5% in adults, and chronic infection carries lifelong risks of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, underscoring why prevention at birth is critical even if transmission has already occurred [^b107cc06] [^8e6463c3].

> Next, I should review the durability of vaccine-induced protection. Let me verify the long-term data. Vaccination in infancy confers protection for at least 20–30 years in immunocompetent individuals, and although anti-HBs titers decline, immune memory persists and prevents chronic infection on exposure, so routine boosters are not recommended for immunocompetent children or adults who completed a primary series [^a72325b4] [^de718724] [^3bd9a81a].

> But wait, what if the infant is a vaccine nonresponder. I should confirm the management. Postvaccination serologic testing at 9–12 months, after maternal antibodies have waned, is recommended for infants of HBsAg-positive mothers; if anti-HBs is less than 10 mIU/mL, revaccination with additional doses is indicated, and this catch-up strategy addresses the small proportion who fail to mount an adequate response [^6daefde6] [^bba46997].

> Let me consider special situations. If the infant is immunocompromised or if the mother has very high HBV DNA, the risk of breakthrough infection despite standard prophylaxis is higher, so additional strategies such as maternal antiviral therapy in late pregnancy may be considered, but vaccination of the infant remains essential in all scenarios [^b782bdc7] [^5c87ceca].

> I should double-check guideline alignment. WHO, CDC/ACIP, AAP, and AASLD all endorse universal infant hepatitis B vaccination beginning at birth, with HBIG for infants of HBsAg-positive mothers, and emphasize that this strategy prevents chronic infection and its sequelae even when perinatal exposure has occurred, which directly answers why we still vaccinate in this situation [^365f4b2f] [^6bc6ed1f] [^8696a035] [^ac30e3c7].

> In summary, I need to ensure the key points are clear. We vaccinate because the birth dose plus HBIG is highly effective at preventing chronic infection when given immediately after exposure, maternal antibodies are transient and insufficient, perinatal infection carries a uniquely high risk of chronicity, and vaccine-induced protection is long-lasting without routine boosters, so completing the infant series is essential even if transmission has already occurred [^5c87ceca] [^b107cc06] [^a72325b4].

---

You still vaccinate a child for hepatitis B even if the mother has already transmitted HBV because the **birth dose plus HBIG reduces chronic infection risk by 70–95%** [^83463b3f] and the full vaccine series provides long-term protection against chronic disease, cirrhosis, and liver cancer [^6f92f72b] [^ac30e3c7]. Maternal antibodies wane quickly and do not prevent chronic infection, so vaccination is essential to establish durable immunity and prevent serious complications [^3bd9a81a] [^b107cc06]. Post-vaccination testing at 9–12 months confirms protection and guides any needed boosters or care [^6daefde6] [^bba46997].

## Rationale for hepatitis B vaccination despite maternal transmission

### Effectiveness of vaccination in preventing chronic infection

- **Birth dose plus HBIG**: Administered within 12–24 hours of birth, this reduces chronic HBV infection by 70–95% in infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers [^83463b3f] [^5c87ceca].

- **Full vaccine series**: Completing the series provides long-term protection against chronic HBV, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma [^6f92f72b] [^ac30e3c7].

- **Immune memory**: Even if anti-HBs wanes, immune memory persists and prevents chronic infection upon re-exposure [^a72325b4] [^3bd9a81a].

---

### Limitations of maternal antibodies

Maternal anti-HBs wanes within 6–12 months and **does not provide lasting protection** [^notfound]. Passive maternal antibodies also **do not prevent chronic HBV infection**, making active vaccination essential [^notfound].

---

### Long-term benefits of vaccination

Vaccination reduces the risk of chronic HBV infection and its complications, including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma [^6f92f72b] [^ac30e3c7]. It also contributes to **herd immunity**, lowering community transmission [^a4a3331c].

## Recommended vaccination schedule and post-vaccination testing

| **Vaccine dose** | **Timing** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|
| First dose (monovalent) | Within 24 hours of birth | - Administer as soon as possible <br/> - Preferably within 12 hours [^83463b3f] [^365f4b2f] |
| Second dose | 1–2 months of age | Ensure minimum interval from first dose [^notfound] |
| Third dose | 6 months of age | Final dose at ≥ 24 weeks of age [^05a21657] |
| HBIG | Within 12 hours of birth | Administer concurrently with first vaccine dose [^938c873f] [^06802337] |
| Post-vaccination serologic testing | 9–12 months of age | - Test for anti-HBs and HBsAg <br/> - Revaccinate if anti-HBs < 10 mIU/mL [^6daefde6] [^bba46997] |

---

## Conclusion

Vaccinating infants born to HBV-positive mothers is essential because the **birth dose plus HBIG markedly reduces chronic infection risk**, maternal antibodies are transient, and the full series provides durable protection against serious liver disease. Post-vaccination testing ensures immunity and guides any needed boosters or care [^83463b3f] [^6daefde6].

### Hepatitis B vaccination: the key towards elimination and eradication of hepatitis B [^ef038d1c]. Journal of Hepatology (2009). Low credibility.

Hepatitis B virus infection is a global health problem. Worldwide, about 360 million people are chronically infected with the virus. They continue to spread the virus to others and are themselves at risk of chronic liver diseases and hepatocellular carcinoma. The infection can now be treated by antivirals or interferons and the transmission route can be interrupted. Nevertheless, the most effective means is to immunize all susceptible individuals, especially young children, with safe and efficacious vaccines. The combined efforts of vaccination, effective treatment and interruption of transmission make elimination of the infection plausible and may eventually lead to eradication of the virus. Because hepatitis B vaccination has a key role in the control of hepatitis B, properties of this vaccine, its effectiveness in pre-exposure and post-exposure settings, duration of protection after vaccination and the need of booster doses are discussed. Mass hepatitis B vaccination in children decreases the carriage of the virus, and the diseases associated with acute and chronic infection, including hepatocellular carcinoma. Challenges that need to be solved to expand mass vaccination, and the strategies towards elimination and eventual eradication of hepatitis B in the world are also discussed.

### Epidemiology of hepatitis B and hepatitis B virus infection in United States children [^b8710f09]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Before the era of routine hepatitis B vaccination, an estimated 24,000 children acquired hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection each year in the United States. Childhood hepatitis B immunization has led to significant declines in the incidence and prevalence of HBV infection in U.S. children. Because the greatest burden of hepatitis B is caused by complications of hepatocellular carcinoma and cirrhosis in adults who were infected with HBV as children, most of the benefits of vaccination have yet to be realized. Reaching the goal of eliminating HBV transmission to children likely will require increasing vaccination coverage, ensuring timely administration of postexposure immunoprophylaxis to prevent more perinatal infections, and continued evaluation of the impact of immunization recommendations.

HEPATITIS B

What is Hepatitis B?

Viral hepatitis type B caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a serious, potentially life-threatening disease that can be prevented by vaccination. Most people that are (newly) HBV infected remain asymptomatic and do not know their hepatitis status for many years. Only some individuals newly infected with HBV have symptoms (acute hepatitis) [1, 2]. The symptoms can include extreme fatigue, abdominal pain, nausea, and jaundice. Most available scientific evidence suggests that HBV is not directly cytopathic, but that liver damage is caused by the cellular response to viral proteins in infected hepatocytes [3]. For many people, hepatitis B is a short-term illness as clinical signs and symptoms of acute hepatitis B usually resolve within 1 to 3 months. Fulminant liver failure occurs in approximately 0.5% to 1.0% of adults with reported acute hepatitis B. In a subset of persons, the HBV can also cause a chronic liver infection that can later develop into cirrhosis (scarring of the liver) or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The course of chronic HBV infection is dynamic with different clinical phases, each of which potentially lasts for decades [5,]. Most of the disease burden associated with HBV infection occurs among persons with chronic infection.

The age of acquisition of the HBV infection is the main determining factor in the clinical expression of acute disease and the development of chronic infection [, 9]. Fewer than 10% of children younger than 5 years who become infected have initial clinical signs or symptoms of disease (ie, acute hepatitis B) compared to 30% of infections in adults [10, 11]. The risk of developing chronic HBV infection varies inversely with age; 80%–90% of infants infected during their first year of life develop chronic infections, as opposed to 30%–50% of children infected before the age of 6 years and 1%–5% of adults [10, 11]. Neonatal immune tolerance to viral antigens appears to play an important role in viral persistence in infants infected at birth [12, 13]. Because HBV infections occurring perinatally, during infancy, or in early childhood are most likely to become chronic, vaccination of new-borns and infants is today a key intervention for prevention of HBV infections.

### Hepatitis B (prevention) [^8e6463c3]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2009). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Nearly a third of the world's population has been infected by hepatitis B at some point, and at least 350 million people have become chronic carriers. Progressive liver damage occurs in up to 25% of carriers. In areas of high endemicity, transmission occurs largely in childhood; from an infected mother to her baby, or between members of a household.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of vaccination against hepatitis B infection in countries with high endemicity? What are the effects of vaccination against hepatitis B infection in countries with low endemicity? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to June 2008 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations, such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 51 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: selective vaccination of high-risk individuals; selective vaccination of people with chronic liver disease not caused by hepatitis B; universal vaccination of adolescents; and universal vaccination of infants.

### Will infant hepatitis B immunization protect adults? [^de718724]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Globally, infant hepatitis B virus (HBV) immunization programs are markedly reducing the rate of chronic HBV infections among children <5 years of age. Desirable improvements include increased birth dose coverage and better prevention of perinatal HBV transmission. Follow-up studies show that by the teenage years most of those immunized as infants have lost circulating anti-HBs antibody and some fail to respond to challenge HBV vaccination, implying loss of protection from infection. With high exposure to HBV, such individuals can develop breakthrough HBV infection but this rarely leads to chronic infection, the main goal of prevention programs. While longer-term follow-up studies into adulthood are needed, current evidence does not support a need for booster immunization of otherwise healthy teens or young adults.

### Hepatitis B virus infection, its sequelae, and prevention by vaccination [^bea4e215]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2011). Low credibility.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a global health problem. There are >350 million of people chronically infected with this virus worldwide. Hepatitis B vaccines are effective in preventing the infection. Humoral immunity is the key factor in conferring the protection. Hepatitis B surface antibody titers of ≥10mIU/mL are protective. Chronic carriage of HBV is related to the age when the infection occurs, the younger the age the higher the chronicity rate. Hence, vaccination should be given in early childhood. People vaccinated in infancy have a protection of >20 years, and hepatocellular carcinoma decreases in them. Although the vaccine-conferred immunity wanes by time, a universal booster is not recommended at present.

### Evaluating existing recommendations for hepatitis A and B vaccination [^6cb2b6d0]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccines are now widely available throughout the United States, Europe, and most of the rest of the world. A recombinant hepatitis B vaccine was licensed in the United States in 1986, followed by hepatitis A vaccine in 1995. Official recommendations from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices were published for hepatitis B vaccine in 1990, with revisions in 1991, and for hepatitis A vaccine in 1999. Unfortunately, the recommendations are not closely followed, and an insufficient number of persons who are at risk receive these vaccines. In addition, the available recommendations may not cover all who are at risk for infection. This article reviews existing recommendations for the use of hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccines and offers suggestions for situations in which additional recommendations may be useful. The rationale for revising and expanding the existing recommendations is based on questions raised about the value of risk-based recommendations, data demonstrating increasing rates of hepatitis A and B infections in specific age groups, and the failure to protect 50% of individuals who become infected with vaccine-preventable hepatitis.

### Hepatitis B in women: domestically and internationally [^037e8b1e]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Globally, hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major cause of infectious disease–related death, causing approximately 620,000 deaths annually. Without hepatitis B vaccination, an estimated 1.4 million HBV-related deaths would occur in the 2000 birth cohort over the lifetime of the cohort. HBV infections acquired in the perinatal and early childhood periods account for 21% and 48%, respectively, of HBV-related deaths worldwide. Thus, routine vaccination of infants and children serves as the basis for a global hepatitis B prevention program.

In 1992, the World Health Organization recommended that hepatitis B vaccine be included in childhood immunization programs in all countries, but because of financial constraints, many countries were unable to initially implement this recommendation. In 1999, a global initiative began to make hepatitis B vaccine available to children living in 69 of the world's poorest countries, and by the end of 2003, routine childhood hepatitis B vaccination was included in national immunization programs in >151 countries. However, many countries, mainly in sub-Saharan Africa, have not yet introduced the vaccine, and coverage with the three-dose vaccination series remains low in many countries that have introduced the vaccine. When all countries have introduced the vaccine and coverage with the three-dose vaccination series reaches 90%, up to 84% of global HBV-related deaths will be prevented.

Regarding preventative measures for hepatitis B virus infection, more specifically with respect to immunizations, infants, WHO 2024 guidelines recommend to administer the first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine in all infants as soon as possible after birth, preferably within 24 hours, followed by 2-3 additional doses to complete the primary immunization series.

### Hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus infections in children [^91e7ffc5]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To analyse the most relevant recent information on efficacy, duration and coverage of anti-hepatitis B virus vaccination; correlates of mother-to-child hepatitis C virus transmission; the natural history and outcomes of hepatitis B and C virus infections in children; the efficacy and safety of specific therapies.

Recent Findings

Insufficient hepatitis B virus vaccine coverage and incomplete or delayed vaccine cycles need improvement in many countries. Hepatitis B virus mutants may explain some fulminant hepatitis in perinatally infected infants and vaccine failures. No interventions to prevent vertical hepatitis C virus transmission have been identified. Spontaneous clearance of hepatitis B is lower in children than in adults, while the rates appear to be similar for hepatitis C. The disease progression is slower for both infections in childhood. Several studies support the efficacy and safety of interferons and lamivudine in chronic hepatitis B or of interferons and ribavirin in chronic hepatitis C in children, but the optimal therapy remains unclear.

Summary

There are doubts as to the long-term persistence of anti-hepatitis B immunization in low-endemicity areas. Routine hepatitis C virus testing in pregnancy is not recommended as there are no available prophylactic measures. Although hepatitis B and C virus infections are usually asymptomatic or with mild manifestations in childhood, concerns around their long-term clinical impact suggest the need for early treatment. Children should preferably be treated in the context of targeted trials for a better understanding of the efficacy and tolerance of drugs currently used in adults.

### Hepatitis B vaccines [^83463b3f]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Because perinatal and early postnatal transmission are the major cause of chronic hepatitis infection, hepatitis B vaccination is now recommended by the WHO for all infants beginning at birth (universal vaccination) and children and adolescents who did not receive the hepatitis B vaccine during infancy (catch-up vaccination). For adults, it is still recommended for those who are at increased risk for HBV infection [19]. The need for immunizing these high-risk people is determined by the baseline epidemiology of HBV infection in the country. Generally, implementation of routine infant immunization produces broad population-based immunity to HBV infection and eventually prevents HBV transmission in all age groups. Hence, the catch-up vaccination is now prioritized for younger age groups because the risk of chronic infection is the highest in these cohorts [2].

To provide maximal protection against mother-to-child transmission, the first dose of (monovalent) hepatitis B vaccine should be given as soon as possible (<24 hours) after birth [40]. In randomized, placebo-controlled trials, administration of hepatitis B vaccine in a 3- or 4-dose schedule, beginning less than 12 hours after birth prevents 70% to 95% of perinatal HBV infections among infants born to highly infectious women who are positive for both HBsAg and HBeAg. The effectiveness of the birth dose in preventing perinatal transmission declines progressively in the days after birth; however, a late birth dose may still be partially effective [40, 42]. As of 2016, 101 (52%) countries had introduced this WHO-recommended birth dose. However, in some settings, the administration of a birth dose is restricted by the high proportions of births in nonmedical facilities, lack of trained health care staff, poor political commitment, and logistical and cultural issues [44]. A substantial burden of chronic HBV infection persists because the global coverage of the timely birth dose is still low, estimated globally at 42% by the end of 2018. In 20 (10%) countries, where a program of screening for all pregnant women has been installed, the hepatitis B birth dose was introduced only for infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers. In low- and middle-income countries as well as in industrialized countries screening of all pregnant women before delivery, offering timely neonatal vaccination, and monitoring HBsAg and anti-HBs in vaccinated infants from HBsAg positive mothers remains a clear challenge.

### Persistence of HBsAg-specific antibodies and immune memory two to three decades after hepatitis B vaccination in adults [^a72325b4]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2019). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Approximately 292 million individuals (3.9% of the world's population) were living with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in 2016. 1, 2 Chronic infection can be asymptomatic for many years and increases the risk of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Moreover, chronically infected individuals are a source of transmission of the virus. In 2015, nearly 900 000 people died as a consequence of HBV infection. 1, 3

As the risk of chronic HBV infection is highest when infection is acquired perinatally or during early childhood, 4 young children are the main target of prevention efforts. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends hepatitis B vaccination as soon as possible after birth, followed by two or three doses during infancy. 5 It also recommends vaccinating older age groups at high risk of HBV infection and catch‐up vaccination in previously unvaccinated individuals. 5 Vaccines containing hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) have been available since the early eighties. Their widespread use in infant immunization programmes has led to a decline in acute and chronic HBV infection and related morbidity and mortality. 1, 6, 7, 8 The childhood incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma decreased significantly after implementation of universal hepatitis B vaccination in Taiwan and other countries. 9

While the value of hepatitis B vaccination is evident, the duration of protection after vaccination is not exactly known; based on evidence indicating immune memory and protection against infection up to 30 years after a complete primary series, the WHO does not recommend a booster in adequately vaccinated immunocompetent children and adults. 5, 10, 11 Additional studies are needed to fully estimate how long protection lasts; long‐term follow‐up studies after adult vaccination are particularly scarce.

B‐ and T‐cell‐mediated immune memory confers long‐term protection after waning of vaccine‐induced antibodies against HBsAg (anti‐HBs). 12, 13, 14 Different methods have been used to assess long‐term HBV protection, including measuring the anamnestic response to a challenge dose, in vitro testing for B‐ and T‐cell activation, or measuring the infection rate in vaccinated populations after extended follow‐up. 14, 15

Regarding preventative measures for hepatitis B virus infection, more specifically with respect to immunizations, infants, WHO 2024 guidelines recommend to ensure that delivery of hepatitis B vaccine within 24 hours of birth is a performance indicator in all immunization programs, and strengthen reporting and monitoring systems to improve the quality of data on the birth dose.

### An evidence-based practical guide to vaccination for hepatitis B virus [^5b93c4ec]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

The hepatitis B virus (HBV) is highly infectious, with over 292 million chronically infected people worldwide and up to 2.4 million in the United States. Following infection, clinically silent liver damage can ensue, but symptoms or signs of advanced disease, including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, can take decades to emerge. HBV has the heaviest public health burden of all hepatitis viruses and has now surpassed other major communicable diseases (eg, HIV, diarrheal disease, malaria, tuberculosis) as a leading cause of death globally. Preventing transmission is essential, and efforts are in place to reinforce screening, vaccination, and routine follow-up. Three safe and effective vaccines are available in the United States and other countries for HBV prevention, and the benefits of vaccination in preventing infection and its sequelae have been substantiated. For the first time in over 25 years, a new Food and Drug Administration-approved vaccine is available that offers a high degree of immunogenicity after 2, rather than 3, injections. Persistent challenges include the underutilization of vaccination, choice of vaccine, incomplete vaccinations, varying needs in different populations, management of nonresponders or those with undocumented or incompletely documented vaccination courses, and questions about whether and when booster injections may be needed. A panel of US academic hepatologists with expertise and experience in preventing and managing HBV infection have collaborated to write this practical clinical paper intended to guide clinicians in vaccinating for HBV and address questions that regularly arise in the clinic.

Novel (Therapeutic) Hepatitis B Vaccines

As current treatment for chronic hepatitis B is not curative, therapeutic immunization for persons with chronic HBV infection and restoring the defective immune tolerance to HBV remains an important goal. Great efforts have been taken using different approaches to stimulate the humoral and/or cellular immune responses. However, until now, the clinical efficacy shown in clinical trials in humans is limited. Also, as indicated above, new vaccine formulations have been and are being developed to meet the challenges of nonresponse or low response among older adults and immunocompromised individuals. Additionally, novel injection devices (eg, Uniject) and intradermal, oral, and nasal prophylactic hepatitis B vaccines, which might be easier to administer than injections, are under investigation.

Ending Hepatitis B as a Major Public Health Threat

Following the endorsement of the Global Health Sector Strategy on viral hepatitis (2016–2021) by the World Health Assembly, the WHO developed ambitious targets for the elimination of hepatitis, including HBV as public health threats by 2030 [74]. Service targets include further improvement in childhood vaccine coverage, major increases in birth-dose vaccine coverage or other methods for mother-to-child HBV prevention, and massive expansion of case finding were agreed on. These service improvements are aligned with impact targets of a 90% reduction in new HBV infections and a 65% reduction in HBV-related deaths (compared with 2015 WHO estimates). From the prevention perspective, global efforts are mostly on track for hepatitis B vaccination. The large scale-up of hepatitis B vaccine worldwide over the last 2 decades, which has been in large part due to the support provided by GAVI, has been a great public health success story and contributed to the decrease in HBV infections among children. However, expanding access to a timely birth dose of the hepatitis B vaccine will require major focused effort to increase coverage, as it is the cornerstone of efforts to prevent mother-to-children transmission of HBV. Although major progress has been made over the years, to achieve elimination (further) global and local political commitment will be essential, with the integration of prevention programs in the overall control and therapeutic plans. The battle against HBV is not over yet, but the broad use of hepatitis B vaccination is the cornerstone and most important tool we have to control HBV. We need to ensure financing, provision, distribution, and administration of vaccines to all populations, in particular those that are difficult to reach.

### Hepatitis B: immunization and impact on natural history and cancer incidence [^6f92f72b]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Enhancing host immunity by vaccination to prevent hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains the most important strategy for global control of hepatitis B. Currently, 187 countries have in place infant hepatitis B vaccination programs. Hepatitis B surface antigen prevalence has decreased to less than 1% in children after successful implementation of universal HBV vaccination in newborns. The incidence of primary liver cancer in children, adolescents, and young adults has drastically decreased to near zero in birth cohorts receiving hepatitis B vaccination. Elimination of chronic hepatitis B by 2030 is not a mission impossible.

### Hepatitis B vaccination coverage among adults – United States, 2004 [^cd46e0db]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2006). Low credibility.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major cause of cirrhosis and liver cancer in the United States. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has recommended a comprehensive strategy to eliminate HBV transmission, including prevention of perinatal HBV transmission; universal vaccination of infants; catch-up vaccination of unvaccinated children and adolescents; and vaccination of unvaccinated adults at increased risk for infection. The incidence of acute hepatitis B has declined 75%, from 8.5 per 100,000 population in 1990 to 2.1 per 100,000 population in 2004, with the greatest declines (94%) among children and adolescents. Incidence remains highest among adults, who accounted for approximately 95% of the estimated 60,000 new infections in 2004. To measure hepatitis B vaccination coverage among adults, data were analyzed from the 2004 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). This report summarizes the results of that analysis, which indicated that, during 2004, 34.6% of adults aged 18-49 years reported receiving hepatitis B vaccine, including 45.4% of adults at high risk for HBV infection.

### A comprehensive immunization strategy to eliminate transmission of hepatitis B virus infection in the United States: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP) part 1: immunization of infants, children, and adolescents [^bb2d7adc]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2005). Low credibility.

This report is the first of a two-part statement from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) that updates the strategy to eliminate hepatitis B virus (HBV) transmission in the United States. The report provides updated recommendations to improve prevention of perinatal and early childhood HBV transmission, including implementation of universal infant vaccination beginning at birth, and to increase vaccine coverage among previously unvaccinated children and adolescents. Strategies to enhance implementation of the recommendations include 1) establishing standing orders for administration of hepatitis B vaccination beginning at birth; 2) instituting delivery hospital policies and procedures and case management programs to improve identification of and administration of immunoprophylaxis to infants born to mothers who are hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive and to mothers with unknown HBsAg status at the time of delivery; and 3) implementing vaccination record reviews for all children aged 11-12 years and children and adolescents aged <19 years who were born in countries with intermediate and high levels of HBV endemicity, adopting hepatitis B vaccine requirements for school entry, and integrating hepatitis B vaccination services into settings that serve adolescents. The second part of the ACIP statement, which will include updated recommendations and strategies to increase hepatitis B vaccination of adults, will be published separately.

### Hepatitis B vaccine effectiveness among vaccinated children in Africa: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^41b47d9a]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a serious health problem causing a substantial burden of acute and chronic liver disease. Today, more than 257 million people worldwide are chronically infected with HBV. Despite an effective vaccine, the virus causes about 887,000 deaths yearly. Of chronic hepatitis B (CHB), 61 million live in Africa. The development of CHB among newly infected persons depends on their age at the time of infection. More than 90% of infected infants, 25–50% under five years of age and 6–10% of acutely infected older children develop chronic infection. Up to 25% of infants and older children who acquire HBV infection develop HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or cirrhosis.

The World Health Organization (WHO) 2016 adopted a strategy to globally eliminate HBV infection as a public health threat by 2030, to reduce its incidence by 90% and its mortality by 65%. Studies in areas with high HBV endemicity have shown declines in the prevalence of chronic HBV among children to < 2% after routine infant immunization.

Universal vaccination against HBV in newborns was found to be easier and cost-effective. Many countries have gradually adopted the HBV vaccine in their national immunization programs since the WHO recommended vaccination for children in the 1990s. As of 2007, 171 (89%) of the 193 WHO member states had initiated a hepatitis B vaccination program. Vaccination with hepatitis-B vaccine has been considered an important tool for protection against HBV infection.

An anti-HBs concentration of ≥ 10 mIU/mL measured 1–3 months after administering the last dose of the initial vaccination series is considered a reliable marker of protection against infection. The hepatitis-B vaccination should produce a protective level of anti-HBs in ≥ 95% of the vaccinated individuals after completion of the recommended vaccination schedule. After primary hepatitis B immunization, anti-HBs concentrations decline rapidly within the first year and more slowly thereafter. To our knowledge, no meta-analysis assesses the anti-HBs level among vaccinated children in Africa. Thus, this meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the evidence of the effectiveness of HB vaccine among vaccinated children in Africa.

### Global control of hepatitis B virus infection [^b647429d]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2002). Medium credibility.

Worldwide about 350 million people are chronic carriers of the hepatitis B virus (HBV). The infection can cause acute and chronic liver disease including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Hepatocellular injuries of HBV infection are predominantly immune-mediated, and the natural history of chronic infection can be divided into three phases based on virus-host interactions-namely, immune tolerance, immune clearance, and viral integration phases. Four serotypes (adw, ayw, adr, and ayr) and seven genotypes (A to G) of HBV have been identified, and they show some distinct geographic distributions. The HBV genotypes may have clinical relevance and are currently under investigation. On the basis of disease burden and the availability of safe and effective vaccines, the WHO recommended that by the end of the 20th century hepatitis B vaccine be incorporated into routine infant and childhood immunisation programmes for all countries. The efficacy of universal immunisation has been shown in different countries, with striking reductions of the prevalence of HBV carriage in children. Most important, hepatitis B vaccination can protect children against HCC and fulminant hepatitis, as has been shown in Taiwan. Nevertheless, the implementation of worldwide vaccination against HBV requires greater effort to overcome the social and economic hurdles. Safe and effective antiviral treatments are available but are still far from ideal, a situation that, hopefully, will be improved soon. With hepatitis B immunisation, the global control of HBV infection is possible by the end of the first half of 21st century.

### Fact checked: hepatitis B vaccine given to newborns reduces (...) [^8696a035]. AAP (2025). Medium credibility.

The Claim in Context Immunizing newborns against hepatitis B is critical to reduce chronic hepatitis B later in life. False claims that call this benefit into question jeopardize the health of children. The U. S. has made significant progress in reducing chronic hepatitis B, largely due to the birth dose and completion of the infant series, and eliminating the birth dose would reverse this progress and lead to more cases of perinatally acquired hepatitis B and hepatitis B infections throughout childhood. Key Facts
- Hepatitis B is a viral infection that attacks the liver and can cause both acute and chronic disease. Chronic infection over the course of a lifetime can lead to liver damage, liver failure, liver cancer, or even death.
- Hepatitis B is transmitted through blood or body fluids, and perinatal exposure typically occurs during labor and delivery.
- Newborns can acquire hepatitis B at birth if the mother is infected with the hepatitis B virus.

Administering a hepatitis B vaccine within 24 hours of birth, known as a birth dose, is highly effective in preventing infection in newborns.
- Adults with an infection may not be aware they carry the virus. It is highly contagious and can be transmitted while caring for an infant after birth. A birth dose of the hepatitis B vaccine and completion of the vaccines series in infancy also helps protect older infants and children from exposure to the virus by other caregivers and others, known as horizontal transmission. Why It Matters Hepatitis B can lead to serious lifelong illnesses or even death, and a hepatitis B birth dose provides a critical safety net protecting infants from acquiring a potentially serious infection at the time of birth. Late-stage hepatitis B can lead to cirrhosis of the liver and liver cancer. The U. S. is currently on track to eliminating perinatal hepatitis B, with only 17 reported cases in 2021 and 13 in 2022.

However, eliminating the birth dose would jeopardize this progress. Experts Say: "The Hepatitis B vaccine is one of the most important steps we can take to protect babies in their first 24 hours of life. Hepatitis B, if untreated, can lead to serious complications, including liver cancer. Many adults with Hepatitis B do not look or feel sick, and may not be aware they could transmit the virus to an infant they are caring for. Vaccinating newborns provides a critical safety net for children. ” James Campbell MD, FAAP, member of AAP’s Committee on Infectious Diseases.

### Prevention of hepatitis B virus infection in the United States: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices [^938c873f]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Summary

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is transmitted via blood or sexual contact. Persons with chronic HBV infection are at increased risk for cirrhosis and liver cancer and require medical care. This report updates and summarizes previously published recommendations from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and CDC regarding the prevention of HBV infection in the United States. ACIP recommends testing all pregnant women for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), and testing HBsAg-positive pregnant women for hepatitis B virus deoxyribonucleic acid (HBV DNA); administration of HepB vaccine and hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) for infants born to HBV-infected women within 12 hours of birth, followed by completion of the vaccine series and postvaccination serologic testing; universal hepatitis B vaccination within 24 hours of birth, followed by completion of the vaccine series; and vaccination of children and adolescents aged <19 years who have not been vaccinated previously. ACIP recommends vaccination of adults at risk for HBV infection, including universal vaccination of adults in settings in which a high proportion have risk factors for HBV infection and vaccination of adults requesting protection from HBV without acknowledgment of a specific risk factor. These recommendations also provide CDC guidance for postexposure prophylaxis following occupational and other exposures. This report also briefly summarizes previously published American Association for the Study of Liver Diseasest guidelines for maternal antiviral therapy to reduce perinatal HBV transmission

### UK vaccination schedule: persistence of immunity to hepatitis B in children vaccinated after perinatal exposure [^36d6962a]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2013). Low credibility.

What is already known on this topic

Children born to women with detectable hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) are at very high risk of becoming chronically infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV).
An accelerated course of HBV vaccination from birth is effective at reducing transmission and universally recommended for infants of HBsAg positive mothers.
Current UK guidelines recommend that children, with ongoing exposure to HBV infection, receive a preschool HBV vaccine booster.

What this study adds

This cohort of perinatally exposed UK children, immunised at 0, 1, 2 and 12 months of age, retained immunity against HBV through early childhood.
There is a need for further research into the necessity of the currently recommended preschool booster dose of HBV vaccine for children immunised with an accelerated course of HBV vaccine in infancy.

Children born to women with detectable hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) are at very high risk of becoming chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) carriers.An accelerated course of HBV vaccine initiated at birth is effective at reducing transmission,and is universally recommended for infants of HBsAg positive mothers.

Due to low disease prevalence, immunisation against HBV in the UK is currently targeted at specific ‘at-risk’ groups rather than being universal. Children born to HBV infected mothers are immunised at 0, 1, 2 and 12 months of age. A 2006 update to the UK immunisation guidelinesexplicitly recommended a ‘preschool’ booster dose of HBV vaccine be added to this schedule. Internationally, there is consensus that there are insufficient data to recommend booster doses in immunocompetent children vaccinated following perinatal exposure.To the best of our knowledge, no other countries recommend HBV vaccine boosters in perinatally exposed children.

To investigate the need for this ‘preschool’ booster we studied anti-HBsAg (anti-HBs) IgG titres in children immunised with the current (0, 1, 2, 12 month) UK infant schedule before and after a booster dose of HBV vaccine in mid-childhood.

### Universal hepatitis B vaccination in adults aged 19-59 years: updated recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices-United States, 2022 [^fdee8745]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical Guidance

ACIP recommends that adults aged 19–59 years and adults aged ≥60 years with risk factors for hepatitis B should receive HepB vaccines, and that adults aged ≥60 years without known risk factors for hepatitis B may receive HepB vaccines. In previous HepB vaccine recommendations, providers were advised to administer HepB vaccine to all patients who requested it. The new language for adults aged ≥60 years without known risk factors is intended to prompt all providers to offer HepB vaccination to patients in that cohort, rather than wait for a patient to request vaccination, thus shifting the responsibility of initiating the consideration of HepB vaccination from the patient to the provider.

Persons who have completed a HepB vaccination series at any point or who have a history of HBV infection should not receive additional HepB vaccination, although there is no evidence that receiving additional vaccine doses is harmful. ¶ However, there are cases where revaccination might be indicated as specified in the 2018 ACIP recommendation (e.g. nonresponder infants born to persons testing positive for hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg], health care providers, and persons on hemodialysis). Providers should only accept dated records as evidence of HepB vaccination. Vaccination of persons immune to HBV infection because of current or previous infection or HepB vaccination does not increase the risk for adverse events. However, in settings in which the patient population has a high rate of previous HBV infection, ** prevaccination testing, which may be performed concomitantly with administration of the first dose of vaccine, might reduce costs by avoiding complete vaccination of persons who are already immune. Prevaccination testing consists of testing for HBsAg, antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs), and antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc). The presence of HBsAg indicates current HBV infection. The presence of anti-HBs is generally interpreted as indicating immunity, either from HepB vaccination after a complete series or after recovery from HBV infection. The presence of total anti-HBc indicates previous or ongoing infection with HBV. Detailed interpretations of serologic markers for HBV infection are available (2). Lack of access to serologic testing should not be a barrier to vaccination of susceptible persons, especially in populations that are difficult to reach. Testing is not a requirement for vaccination, and in settings where testing is not feasible, vaccination of persons recommended to receive the vaccine should continue.

### Screening and testing for hepatitis B virus infection: CDC recommendations-United States, 2023 [^fd5c82e9]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Universal screening: Universal screening of adults is cost-effective compared with risk-based screening and averts liver disease and death. Although a curative treatment is not yet available, early diagnosis and treatment of chronic HBV infections reduces the risk for cirrhosis, liver cancer, and death. Risk-based testing alone has not identified most persons living with chronic HBV infection and is considered inefficient for providers to implement.
Triple panel screening: Using the triple panel (HBsAg, anti-HBs, and total anti-HBc) is recommended for initial screening because it can help identify persons who have an active HBV infection and could be linked to care, have resolved infection and might be susceptible to reactivation (e.g. immunosuppressed persons), are susceptible and need vaccination, or are vaccinated. When someone receives triple panel screening, any future periodic testing can use tests as appropriate (e.g. only HBsAg and anti-HBc if the patient is unvaccinated).
Adults aged ≥18 years: An “all adults” recommendation was considered more feasible to implement (e.g. for integrating into electronic medical record alerts) than one among specific age groups. Considerations included the favorable economic analysis across adult age groups, similarly low vaccination rates among adult age groups, comparable epidemiology of acute and chronic infections from surveillance data among age groups, and harms of missed identification of chronic infections.
Children and adolescents aged <18 years: Children and adolescents aged <18 years were not included in the universal screening recommendation because of the low prevalence of HBV infection in this age group and high levels of HepB vaccination. Children and adolescents aged <18 years who have risk factors and did not receive a complete vaccine series should be tested (Figure 2). FIGURE 2 Incorporating hepatitis B virus screening and testing into a clinic workflow, by age Abbreviations: ACIP = Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices; anti-HBc = antibody to hepatitis B core antigen; anti-HBs = antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen; HBV = hepatitis B virus; HBsAg = hepatitis B surface antigen; HepB = hepatitis B.
New risk groups: The addition of three new risk groups was based on the HBV infection prevalence cutoff of ≥1%. The selection of the three groups for which to conduct systematic reviews was based on expert judgment, and the work group recognizes other populations might also be at increased risk.

### Benefits of early hepatitis B immunization programs for newborns and infants [^3642cd8f]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Despite the availability of safe and effective hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccines for >20 years, strategies targeting risk groups failed to sufficiently control hepatitis B disease at the population level; this is mainly because of difficulties in risk identification and in program implementation. Hence, the global burden of disease of HBV still is substantial. The World Health Organization recommends universal vaccination against hepatitis B to ultimately eliminate HBV; this recommendation had been progressively implemented to reach 168 countries with a universal program by the end of 2006. However, hepatitis B immunization is currently becoming endangered of losing its place on the agendas of governments, agencies, and international organizations, mainly because of the increasing success of these immunization programs and the interest in newer vaccine-preventable diseases and the related programs.This publication aims to show that vaccination programs targeting newborns and infants are preferable to achieve this goal. The benefits of universal HBV vaccination for newborns and infants are: higher impact on chronic carrier rate and transmission; established potential of high vaccine coverage in this age group; opportunities to combine HBV vaccination with existing universal vaccination programs for newborns and infants; and impact on perinatal transmission, if vaccination is started shortly after birth. Moreover, the safety, immunogenicity, and long-term efficacy of newborn and infant HBV vaccination have been proven extensively. In summary, newborn and infant HBV vaccination programs should be considered the preferred strategy, capable of providing important and sustained impact on global HBV incidence, even if they have a delayed impact on sexual transmission of HBV.

### Global hepatitis Elimination 2030: immediate action is the need of the hour [^51bdbc10]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Specific populations are at a higher risk of infection, including people with a history of exposure with unsafe needles, frequent blood transfusions and improper sterilisation during procedures. Newborns and children are especially at risk through. Most of the global burden of chronic hepatitis B can be attributed to vertical transmission of hepatitis B virus peripartum or through horizontal transmission in early childhood.

Despite having established treatment and prevention strategies for viral hepatitis, we are off track for the WHO goal for global elimination by 2030. This is majorly because the global coverage for viral hepatitis prevention, diagnosis, and treatment is low. Unfortunately, by the end of 2022, a mereliving with chronic hepatitis B infection had been diagnosed, and an even smaller proportion (3%) received antiviral therapy. Additionally, only 36% of people living with hepatitis C were diagnosed between 2015 and 2022, and only 20% had received curative treatment.

July 28th is World Hepatitis Day, and this year the themepushes us to factor in effective change in all three domains, if the world intends to meet the 2030 deadline. The vaccine against hepatitis B virus has been around since 1969, and now, more than 50 years later,have made monovalent hepatitis B vaccination within 24 h of birth, followed by additional two to three doses in early childhood; a part of their immunisation schedules. Of the 38 WHO focus countries for the viral hepatitis response, 25 countries have introduced birth-dose programmes, and all provide the hepatitis B vaccine (usually as part of pentavalent vaccines) in their infant vaccination programme. However, coverage varies, and is reported to bein the WHO African region. The monovalent hepatitis B virus is also available for at risk adults (health-care workers, patients receiving frequent transfusions, etc) in a three-dose schedule. Unfortunately, we are yet to have a vaccine against hepatitis C, which would be an important milestone in this struggle.

### Prevalence of hepatitis B vaccination coverage and serologic evidence of immunity among US-born children and adolescents from 1999 to 2016 [^a4a3331c]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

According to the World Health Organization guideline for HBV vaccination, there is no evidence to recommend a booster dose to those who completed the vaccine series and have a low risk of infection.However, it is recommended that people at high risk of infection receive a booster dose if their anti-HBs level is less than 10 mIU/mL. Our study demonstrated a significant decrease in vaccine-associated immunity in the later years of the study period, suggesting the importance of reexamining the need for surveillance. In addition, there might be need for a booster dose in selected populations, such as teenagers engaged in high-risk activities. In fact, some researchers have suggested that individuals aged 13 to 19 years be closely monitored to determine whether a booster dose is needed if their anti-HBs level becomes undetectable.The incidence of acute hepatitis B infection among children and adolescents aged 0 to 19 years has remained low in the US from 2000 to 2015.In addition, despite the waning immunity, serologic evidence of hepatitis B infection in children and adolescents has remained minimal. This finding could be attributable to herd immunity given that the universal HBV vaccination program in the US was launched in 1991. In addition, the lack of measurable anti-HBs level despite completion of the hepatitis B vaccine series does not necessarily indicate a lack of immunity. Several studies,,,,,,, on immune memory have found that a majority of individuals who are no longer positive for anti-HBs many years after vaccination can still mount an immune response after receiving a hepatitis B booster dose (eAppendix in the Supplement). Nevertheless, future studies should be considered to determine the mechanism for the decreasing immunity in the observed birth cohorts and the associated clinical implication regarding future needs for booster vaccination.

### Prevention of hepatitis B virus infection in the United States: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices [^6bc6ed1f]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Strategy to Eliminate HBV

In 1991, the United States adopted a strategy for universal HepB vaccination of infants. A comprehensive strategy to eliminate HBV transmission evolved over the ensuing 3 decades and encompasses 1) routine testing of all pregnant women for HBsAg and prophylaxis for infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers, 2) universal vaccination of infants beginning at birth, 3) routine vaccination of previously unvaccinated children and adolescents, and 4) vaccination of adults at risk for HBV infection (–,–). Preventing perinatal transmission relies upon testing all pregnant women for HBsAg and administering timely prophylaxis (HepB vaccine and hepatitis B immune globulin [HBIG]) to infants born to infected mothers. Universal HepB vaccination of all infants beginning at birth provides a critical safeguard and prevents infection among infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers not identified prenatally (e.g. in situations where the mother was not tested or when testing, interpretation, or transcription errors occurred). Vaccination of children and adolescents not previously vaccinated and vaccination of adults at risk for HBV infection (e.g. by sexual or percutaneous exposure and international travelers to certain countries) is recommended to prevent HBV transmission outside of the perinatal setting (Box 2).

Persons Recommended for HepB Vaccination

Universal Vaccination of Infants

All infants should receive the HepB vaccine series as part of the recommended childhood immunization schedule, beginning at birth as a safety net (Box 4 ; Table 3).
For all medically stable infants weighing ≥2,000 grams at birth and born to HBsAg-negative mothers, the first dose of vaccine should be administered within 24 hours of birth (new recommendation). Only single-antigen HepB vaccine should be used for the birth dose.
Infants weighing <2,000 grams and born to HBsAg-negative mothers should have their first vaccine dose delayed to the time of hospital discharge or age 1 month (even if weight is still <2,000 grams). For these infants, a copy of the original laboratory report indicating that the mother was HBsAg negative during this pregnancy should be placed in the infant's medical record. Infants weighing <2,000 grams at birth have a decreased response to HepB vaccine administered before age 1 month.
For infants transferred to a different facility after birth (e.g. a hospital with a higher level of neonatal care), staff at the transferring and receiving facilities should communicate regarding the infant’s HepB vaccination and HBIG receipt status to ensure prophylaxis is administered in a timely manner (new recommendation).
The final dose in the vaccine series should not be administered before age 24 weeks (164 days).
In populations with currently or previously high rates of childhood HBV infection (e.g. Alaska Natives; Pacific Islanders; and immigrant families from Asia, Africa, and countries with intermediate or high endemic rates of infection), the first dose of HepB vaccine should be administered at birth and the final dose at age 6–12 months.

Vaccination of Children and Adolescents

HepB vaccination is recommended for all unvaccinated children and adolescents aged <19 years (Box 4).
Children and adolescents who have not previously received HepB vaccine should be vaccinated routinely at any age (i.e. children and adolescents are recommended for catch-up vaccination) (Table 4).

### Impact of hepatitis B vaccination on hepatitis B disease and nucleic acid testing in high-prevalence populations [^e11ff528]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2006). Low credibility.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is highly prevalent in Asia, Africa, southern Europe and Latin America, HBV vaccination has effectively reduced the acute and chronic infection rates as well as related complications in the vaccinated children. The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma in children has been reduced to approximately 25% of the incidence before the vaccination program, and fulminant hepatitis in children has also been reduced after universal hepatitis B vaccination. HBV DNA sero-positive rate was 98-100% in HBsAg positive vaccinated children, while the positive rate was only 11-20% in those vaccinees with a negative HBsAg but positive anti-HBc reaction. Hepatitis B surface gene mutants in HBV DNA positive children increased gradually from 7.8% before the vaccination program, to 19.6%, 28.1% and 23.1% at 5, 10 and 15 years after the vaccination program. Long-term follow-up of vaccinated children has confirmed that universal HBV vaccination in infancy has produced adequate protection up to 14 years of age. The annual decay rate of hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) was 10.2% in children who did not receive a booster dose. The new HBV infection rate was not different between those who did and those who did not receive a booster dose of HBV vaccine. During a follow-up period of seven years for 1200 vaccinated 7-year-old children in Taiwan, the mean annual hepatitis B core antibody sero-conversion rate was 0.2%. All were negative for HBV DNA. No new chronic HBV infections developed. A booster dose of HBV vaccine is not recommended in children under 15 years of age. Systematic HBV DNA screening of a large population such as blood donors may be instrumental in following the long-term effect of the universal vaccination program on the incidence of silent HBV infection and vaccine escape mutants.

BOX 2 
Rationale for universal hepatitis B virus screening

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection has substantial morbidity and mortality.
Chronic HBV infection can be detected before the development of severe liver disease using reliable and inexpensive screening tests.
Treatment for chronic HBV infection can reduce morbidity and mortality.
Management of chronic HBV infection might prevent transmission to others.
Universal screening of adults is cost-effective.
Screening enables identification and management of pregnant persons infected with HBV and their infants, which can reduce the risk for perinatal transmission.
Screening can identify persons who are at risk for reactivation of HBV infection.
Screening might identify persons who would benefit from hepatitis B vaccination.

A one-time HBV screening of adults would be complementary to the 2022 Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommendation to vaccinate all adults aged 19–59 years for HBV infection because screening establishes any history of infection, and vaccination protects from future infection and need for additional testing. The recommendations were supported by peer reviewers who are experts in the field as well as the majority of public comments. Patients with HBV infection have increased morbidity and mortality, and monitoring and treatment can improve health outcomes. If more efficacious treatments are approved in the future, this benefit will increase further. Although increasing awareness of infection is expected to reduce transmission to close contacts, this assumption is hypothetical because of the lack of direct evidence. No studies directly compared universal screening with risk-based screening; therefore, the steering committee relied on the cost-effectiveness study finding that a one-time universal screen of adults is cost-effective and results in improved health outcomes as compared with risk-based screening.

### Implementation of newborn hepatitis B vaccination – worldwide, 2006 [^3361e747]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2008). Low credibility.

Globally, hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections are a major cause of cirrhosis and liver cancer and result in an estimated 620,000 deaths annually. In 1992, the World Health Organization (WHO) set a goal for all countries to introduce hepatitis B (HepB) vaccine into national routine infant immunization programs by 1997. In countries where a high percentage of HBV infections are acquired perinatally (where general population prevalence of chronic HBV infection is >/=8%), WHO recommends administering the first HepB vaccine dose <24 hours after birth to prevent perinatal HBV transmission. To assess implementation of newborn HepB vaccination, the most recently available data were examined from the Joint Reporting Form used by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) to track worldwide vaccine coverage for WHO-recommended infant immunizations. In 2006, a total of 162 (84%) of 193 countries had introduced HepB vaccine into their national infant immunization schedules. Among the 193 countries, 81 (42%) reported using a schedule with a HepB vaccine birth dose (defined as a dose administered within 24 hours of birth). Worldwide, 27% of newborns received a HepB vaccine birth dose in 2006. In the 87 countries with >/=8% chronic HBV infection prevalence, HepB vaccine birth dose coverage was 36%. These findings highlight the global need to implement this key hepatitis B prevention strategy more widely.

### Booster dose vaccination for preventing hepatitis B [^451fec5c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Antibodies against hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) wane over time following hepatitis B immunisation; hence, it is unclear whether people vaccinated in three-dose or four-dose schedules of the hepatitis B vaccine are still immune when the hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) level in their body is undetectable, or lower than the level usually considered protective. This question may potentially be answered indirectly by measuring the anamnestic immune response to a booster dose of vaccine. The term 'booster' (or revaccination) refers to an additional dose of hepatitis B vaccine (HBV) given some time post-primary vaccination to induce immune memory and improve protection against hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of booster dose hepatitis B vaccination, more than five years after the primary vaccination, for preventing HBV infection in healthy individuals previously vaccinated with the hepatitis B vaccine, and with hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) levels below 10 mIU/mL.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded, conference databases, and reference lists of articles to January 2016. We also contacted authors of articles. In addition, we searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for ongoing trials (May 2016).

Selection Criteria

Randomised clinical trials addressing anamnestic immune response to a booster dose of hepatitis B vaccine, more than five years after the primary vaccination, in apparently healthy participants, vaccinated in a three-dose or four-dose schedule of the hepatitis B vaccine during the primary vaccination, without receiving an additional dose or immunoglobulin.

Data Collection and Analysis

Both review authors decided if the identified studies met the inclusion criteria or not. Primary outcomes included the proportion of participants with anamnestic immune response in non-protected participants and signs of HBV infection. Secondary outcomes were the proportion of participants that developed local and systemic adverse events following a booster dose injection. We planned to report the weighted proportion with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

Main Results

There were no eligible randomised clinical trials fulfilling the inclusion criteria of this review.

Authors' Conclusions

We were unable to include any randomised clinical trials on the topic; only randomised clinical trials will be able to provide an answer as to whether a booster dose vaccination is able to protect against hepatitis B infection.

Hepatitis B (HepB) vaccines have demonstrated safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy during the past 4 decades (1,2). However, vaccination coverage among adults has been suboptimal, limiting further reduction in hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections in the United States. This Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommendation expands the indicated age range for universal HepB vaccination to now include adults aged 19-59 years. Removing the risk factor assessment previously recommended to determine vaccine eligibility in this adult age group (2) could increase vaccination coverage and decrease hepatitis B cases.

Immunization Activities

Because immunization is a key intervention to prevent MTCT of HBV, WHO recommends that all newborns receive a timely HepB-BD † dose followed by 2–3 additional HepB doses, according to national schedules. Countries report immunization data to WHO annually through the WHO and UNICEF Joint Reporting Form. WHO and UNICEF review reported coverage data and surveys to generate country-specific coverage estimates. § This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy. ¶

By 2020, 190 (98%) of 194 countries had introduced universal infant hepatitis B vaccination compared with 186 (96%) in 2016. In 2020, 110 (57%) countries provided HepB-BD ** to all newborns, a 10% increase from 100 (52%) in 2016. During 2016–2020, 33 to 34 (17%–18%) countries, mostly in the European Region, administered HepB-BD selectively to newborns of HBsAg-positive mothers (i.e. selective or targeted birth dose vaccination) each year. †† The number of countries that had not introduced routine HepB-BD vaccination declined by 15%, from 60 (31%) in 2016 to 51 (26%) in 2020 §§ (Table 1). Most of these countries are in the African Region where 34 (72%) of 47 countries do not provide a HepB-BD.

### Prevention of chronic hepatitis B after 3 decades of escalating vaccination policy, China [^6cafb73a]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Second, prevention measures must continue for decades. The age group with the highest HBsAg prevalence corresponds to the age groups with the highest fertility rate in China (69.5/1,000 for those 20–24 years and 94.0/1,000 for those age 24–29 years of age). Even when children of today become adults, nearly 200,000 infants will be born to HBsAg carriers each year and will need postexposure prophylaxis to prevent HBV infection.

Third, many newborns still become chronically infected. Although China has reduced perinatal transmission by 97%, an HBsAg prevalence of 0.3% in a birth cohort of 16 million implies that 50,000 perinatal infections still occur annually. Additional strategies will be needed to eliminate vertical transmission.

We believe that the success HBV prevention should be communicated to stakeholders to help sustain confidence in the immunization effort. Confidence in vaccines can be fragile, as was made evident by a temporary loss of confidence in HepB in 2013 and 2014, and showing the strongly positive impact of vaccination may help maintain or restore confidence.

Our results raise several questions. Can the current strategy eliminate perinatal transmission? HepB is not 100% effective, and additional strategies may need to be used. Antiviral prophylaxis during the third trimester for HBsAg-positive pregnant women with high HBV DNA is being shown to decrease perinatal transmission of HBV and may need to become a standard of care in the future.

Should postvaccination serologic testing (PVST) become a recommended standard in China? PVST can help confirm whether an HBV-exposed infant is protected, is susceptible and needs to be revaccinated, or is infected and needs referral for follow-up care. The cost-effectiveness, feasibility, and acceptability of PVST for HBV-exposed infants in China should be evaluated.

Can adults at risk of HBV infection be vaccinated? Identifying cost-effective means to protect at-risk adults from HBV has potential to avert infections.

Finally, treating the estimated 90 million persons with chronic HBV infection is critically important. Prevention works, but not always perfectly, and many adults were born before prevention of HBV was possible.

### A vaccine emergency-when to overrule parental refusal of vaccination at birth for prevention of vertical transmission of hepatitis B virus? [^d715d4d8]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2025). Medium credibility.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a potentially chronic infection that can be transmitted from mother to child with the risk of developing cirrhosis, liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma. There is a safe and effective vaccine to prevent vertical transmission that is recommended to be given as soon as possible after birth and within 24 hours.When a woman with HBV refuses the birth dose of HBV vaccine for her baby, infectious diseases and safeguarding teams are asked to provide urgent opinions on whether this crosses the threshold for triggering child protection mechanisms.We consider a low-infectivity HBV vertical transmission scenario where there is parental refusal of HBV vaccination and focus on ethical arguments for and against overruling parental refusal in the child's best interests. As an additional resource for clinical and safeguarding teams, we also include the anonymised transcript of the only available UK court judgement to our knowledge that addresses the issue of decline of HBV vaccine to prevent vertical transmission.We propose a dialogue process for managing scenarios where a pregnant woman with HBV has concerns about vaccinating her baby when born, which is the basis of the current UK Health Security Agency guidance.

Methods

ACIP’s Hepatitis Work Group comprises professionals from academic medicine (pediatrics, family medicine, internal medicine, infectious disease, occupational health, and preventive medicine specialists), federal and state public health agencies, and medical societies. * The Work Group reviewed epidemiology and literature, directed an economic analysis, and deliberated upon recommendations. The Work Group considered existing published ACIP and CDC vaccine recommendations in summarizing recommendations contained herein for the prevention of HBV infection.

This report updates and supplants ACIP recommendations for HepB vaccination of children and adults published previously. This report incorporates ACIP and CDC recommendations published previously (–).

Guidelines from AASLD inform the use of antiviral therapy among pregnant women with elevated HBV DNA for the purpose of preventing perinatal HBV transmission. Surveillance data were obtained from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS).

Data informing clarifications to the recommendations were summarized on the basis of findings from literature searches that were completed on May 11, 2016. Two search terms were used to ascertain data regarding maximum number of doses for dialysis patients and minimum intervals for dialysis dosing: “Hepatitis b vacc * dialysis boost * ” and “Dialysis hepatitis b vacc * schedule.” Epidemiologic and vaccine coverage data were reviewed, as well as publicly available data on the number of infant abandonments and safely surrendered infants. The literature searches included clinical trials and comparative studies conducted worldwide and published in English since 2000. All studies yielding pertinent information were eligible for inclusion. Search results were supplemented by additional relevant papers identified by subject matter experts on the Work Group. Per the ACIP process, it was predetermined that Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) was not required for these updates of existing recommendations.

### Pregnancy and infection: using disease pathogenesis to inform vaccine strategy [^8cc07abf]. NPJ Vaccines (2018). Low credibility.

Although not associated with congenital disease, hepatitis B virus (HBV) is another vaccine-preventable infection that can cross the placenta during pregnancy. Mother-to-child-transmission remains the most common route of infection in endemic regions,and women with active viral replication have up to a 90% chance of vertical transmission.Of those that are infected perinatally, up to 90% develop chronic HBV infection.Since the initial recommendation of routine HBV vaccination of children in 1991, the rate of new HBV infections has significantly declined in the United States, but chronic HBV remains prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa and East Asia. Although combined passive and active immunoprophylaxis of infants has significantly reduced perinatal HBV infection, perinatal transmission occurs in up to 20% of infected mothers.To augment neonatal prophylactic strategies, the CDC ACIP recommends that pregnant women who are identified as being at risk for HBV infection be vaccinated with the recombinant HBV vaccine.Immunity following receipt of the HBV vaccine is long-lived, with anti-HBV antibodies persisting in most adults for at least 20 years.Because of the long-term protection conferred by the HBV vaccine, immunization is not necessary for pregnant women who have already been vaccinated and are at low risk of infection.

### Accelerating the momentum to achieve global elimination of hepatitis B infection: a scoping review of hepatitis B guidelines to reduce mother to child transmission [^8f81b564]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Approximately 5–10% of individuals failed to develop adequate antibodies after the primary series of HBV vaccination.These vaccine non-responders are vulnerable to horizontal HBV transmission. Only twelve CPGs addressed the management of vaccine non-responders and their suggestions varied. Administering three additional doses of HBV vaccine can induce immunity in 85.3% of infant non-responders.Immunogenic response to revaccination could be increased by increasing number of doses, using a higher antigen dose or a more potent adjuvant.

The strengths of this systematic review include the utilization of a comprehensive search strategy (without language restrictions), and rigorous methodology informed by the AGREE instrument. Furthermore, we thoroughly analyzed all recommendations and information to provide a comprehensive picture that may help researchers identify knowledge gaps requiring further research. Our study had limitations. We simply analyzed the guidelines without going through the evidence behind the recommendations individually. We also could not draw conclusions on certain aspects, such as the timing to discontinue antiviral after delivery, the timing of post-vaccination serological testing and the optimal management of vaccine non-responders. In addition, social factors such as stigma and discrimination, social marginalization, poor education, and limited access to healthcare services are possible barriers to prevention of MTCT and were not explored in this review of CPGs. However, our aims were to draw attention on the deficiency of current CPGs to eliminate HBV, highlight the discrepancies among CPGs and identify any research gaps (Table 5).

Table 5 
Research gaps arising from deficiencies of CPGs.

We highlighted the current insufficiency among CPGs regarding the management of hepatitis B infected pregnant individuals. Current CPGs may miss the opportunity to offer earlier HBV assessment and treatment or suggest an alternative to utilizing HBV DNA to triage women for antiviral prophylaxis. Further evaluation is required on the clinical impact and feasibility of earlier treatment from early second trimester (i.e. 14–20 weeks), expanding the indication of antiviral prophylaxis to all HBV infected pregnant women when triaging investigation is unavailable, and giving the neonatal birth dose vaccination as soon as possible and within 2 h of delivery. These strategies are potential solutions to accelerate the momentum to achieve global elimination of hepatitis B infection.

Further evidence is required to identify the optimal management of hepatitis B infected pregnant individuals to prevent MTCT. The clinical impact and feasibility of earlier initiation and wider application of antiviral prophylaxis, as well as neonatal birth dose vaccination within 2 h should be explored.

Interrupted Schedules and Minimum Dosing Intervals

For all ages, when the HepB vaccine schedule is interrupted, the vaccine series does not need to be restarted. If the series is interrupted after the first dose, the second dose should be administered as soon as possible, and the second and third doses should be separated by an interval of at least 8 weeks. If only the third dose has been delayed, it should be administered as soon as possible. The final dose of vaccine must be administered at least 8 weeks after the second dose and should follow the first dose by at least 16 weeks; the minimum interval between the first and second doses is 4 weeks. Inadequate doses of Hep B vaccine or doses received after a shorter-than-recommended dosing interval should be readministered, using the correct dosage or schedule.
Vaccine doses administered ≤4 days before the minimum interval or age are considered valid. Because of the unique accelerated schedule for Twinrix, the 4-day guideline does not apply to the first 3 doses of this vaccine when administered on a 0-day, 7-day, 21–30-day, and 12-month schedule (new recommendation).
In infants, administration of the final dose is not recommended before age 24 weeks.

Other Immunization Management Issues

No differences in immunogenicity have been observed when one or 2 doses of HepB vaccine produced by one manufacturer are followed by doses from a different manufacturer. Whenever feasible, the same vaccine should be used for the subsequent doses; however, if a different brand is administered, the dose should be considered valid and does not need to be repeated.
Providers should only accept dated records as evidence of HepB vaccination.
Although vaccinations should not be postponed if records cannot be found, an attempt to locate missing records should be made by contacting previous health care providers, reviewing state or local immunization information systems, and searching for a personally held record. If records cannot be located within a reasonable time, these persons should be considered susceptible and started on the age-appropriate vaccination schedule. An anti-HBs ≥10 mIU/mL is a serologic correlate of protection only when following a documented, complete series.
In all settings, vaccination should be initiated even though completion of the series might not be ensured.
Adverse events occurring after administration of any vaccine should be reported to VAERS. Reports should be submitted to VAERS online, by facsimile, or by mail. More information about VAERS is available by calling 1-800-822-7967 (toll-free) or online at.

### EASL clinical practice guidelines on the management of hepatitis B virus infection [^cee83f73]. Journal of Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

The updated EASL Clinical Practice Guidelines on the management of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection provide comprehensive, evidence-based recommendations for its management. Spanning ten thematic sections, the guidelines address diagnostics, treatment goals, treatment indications, therapeutic options, hepatocellular carcinoma surveillance, management of special populations, HBV reactivation prophylaxis, post-transplant care, HBV prevention strategies, and finally address open questions and future research directions. Chronic HBV remains a global health challenge, with over 250 million individuals affected and significant mortality due to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. These guidelines emphasise the importance of early diagnosis, risk stratification based on viral and host factors, and tailored antiviral therapy. Attention is given to simplified algorithms, vaccination, and screening to support global HBV elimination targets. The guidelines also discuss emerging biomarkers and evolving definitions of functional and partial cure. Developed through literature review, expert consensus, and a Delphi process, the guidelines aim to equip healthcare providers across disciplines with practical tools to optimise HBV care and outcomes worldwide.

### Prevention of hepatitis B virus infection in the United States: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices [^b782bdc7]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2018). Low credibility.

No specific treatment exists for acute HBV infection; supportive care is the mainstay of therapy. Guidelines for management of chronic HBV infection in children and adults, including disease monitoring and antiviral therapy, are available. Antiviral therapy generally should be initiated in patients with chronic HBV infection who are likely to respond to treatment and who are at high risk for liver-related morbidity. Maternal antiviral therapy to reduce perinatal transmission is suggested for HBsAg-positive pregnant women whose HBV DNA level is >200,000 IU/mL.

In areas in which HBV is highly endemic, HBV frequently is transmitted perinatally from HBV-infected pregnant women to their newborns. The majority of cases of perinatal HBV transmission occur during delivery, with rare instances of in utero transmission. HBV transmission might occur in germ cell lines, as the virus has been detected in sperm, oocytes, and embryos. Available data do not support the need for a cesarean delivery among HBV-infected pregnant women with low HBV DNA. Prior to the widespread availability of postexposure prophylaxis, the proportion of infants born to HBsAg-positive women acquiring HBV infection was approximately 30% for those born to HBeAg-negative mothers and 85% for those born to HBeAg-positive mothers. With postexposure prophylaxis, comprised of HepB vaccine and HBIG at birth, followed by completion of the HepB vaccine series, 0.7%–1.1% of infants develop infection ; infants born to mothers with high viral loads are at greatest risk for infection despite receipt of HepB vaccine and HBIG. Unvaccinated infants and children are also at risk for horizontal transmission from infected household and other contacts.

Providers should only accept written, dated records as evidence of HepB vaccination.
An increasing number of HCP have received routine HepB vaccination during childhood. No postvaccination serologic testing is recommended after routine infant or adolescent HepB vaccination. Because vaccine-induced anti-HBs wanes over time, testing HCP for anti-HBs years after vaccination might not distinguish vaccine nonresponders from responders. Pre-exposure assessment of current or past anti-HBs results upon hire or matriculation, followed by one or more additional doses of HepB vaccine for HCP with anti-HBs <10 mIU/mL and retesting anti-HBs, if necessary, helps to ensure that HCP will be protected if they have an exposure to HBV-containing blood or body fluids (Box 5 ; Figure 3). BOX 5 Testing anti-HBs for health care personnel (HCP) vaccinated in the past The issue: An increasing number of HCP have received routine hepatitis B (HepB) vaccination during childhood. No postvaccination serologic testing is recommended after routine infant or adolescent HepB vaccination. Because vaccine-induced antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs) wanes over time, testing HCP for anti-HBs years after vaccination might not distinguish vaccine nonresponders from responders. Guidance for health care institutions: Health care institutions may measure anti-HBs upon hire or matriculation for HCP who have documentation of a complete HepB vaccine series in the past (e.g. as part of routine infant or adolescent vaccination). HCP with anti-HBs <10 mIU/mL should receive one or more additional doses of HepB vaccine and retesting (Figure 3). Institutions that decide to not measure anti-HBs upon hire or matriculation for HCP who have documentation of a complete HepB vaccine series in the past should ensure timely assessment and postexposure prophylaxis following an exposure (Table 5). Considerations: The risk for occupational HBV infection for vaccinated HCP might be low enough in certain settings so that assessment of anti-HBs status and appropriate follow-up should be done at the time of exposure to potentially infectious blood or body fluids. This approach relies on HCP recognizing and reporting blood and body fluid exposures and therefore may be applied on the basis of documented low risk, implementation, and cost considerations. Certain HCP occupations have lower risk for occupational blood and body fluid exposures (e.g. occupations involving counseling versus performing procedures), and nontrainees have lower risks for blood and body fluid exposures than trainees. Some settings also will have a lower prevalence of HBV infection in the patient population served than in other settings, which will influence the risk for HCP exposure to HBsAg-positive blood and body fluids. FIGURE 3 Pre-exposure evaluation for health care personnel previously vaccinated with complete, ≥3-dose HepB vaccine series who have not had postvaccination serologic testing* * Should be performed 1–2 months after the last dose of vaccine using a quantitative method that allows detection of the protective concentration of anti-HBs (≥10 mIU/mL) (e.g. enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA]). HCP who cannot provide documentation of 3 doses of HepB vaccine should be considered unvaccinated and should complete the vaccine series. Postvaccination serologic testing for anti-HBs is recommended 1–2 months after the third vaccine dose. HCP who are inadvertently tested before receiving 3 documented doses of HepB vaccine and have anti-HBs ≥10 mIU/mL should not be considered immune because anti-HBs ≥10 mIU/mL is a known correlate of protection only when testing follows a documented 3-dose series. Health care facilities are encouraged to try to locate vaccine records for HCP and to enter all vaccine doses in their state immunization information system.

### Newborn hepatitis B vaccination coverage among children born January 2003-June 2005 – United States [^3375cb83]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2008). Low credibility.

Hepatitis B vaccine was first recommended for administration to all infants in 1991 by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) as the primary focus of a strategy to eliminate hepatitis B virus (HBV) transmission in the United States (1). The recommended timing of administration of the first dose of hepatitis B vaccine to infants has evolved since then to optimize prevention of perinatal and early childhood HBV infections. In 1991, the first dose was recommended to be administered at birth before hospital discharge or at age 1--2 months. In 2002, ACIP indicated a preference for the first dose to be administered to newborns before hospital discharge. In December 2005, ACIP issued revised recommendations specifying that all medically stable newborns who weigh >/=2,000 g (4.4 lbs) receive their first dose of hepatitis B vaccine before hospital discharge. To measure hepatitis B vaccination coverage during the neonatal period, CDC analyzed data from the 2006 National Immunization Survey (NIS). This report summarizes the results of this analysis and provides national, state, and local data on vaccination coverage for infants who received the hepatitis B vaccine during the first days of life. The findings reveal that, during January 2003--June 2005, before implementation of the 2005 ACIP hepatitis B vaccine recommendation, the national newborn hepatitis B vaccination coverage estimate was 42.8% at age 1 day and 50.1% at age 3 days, with substantial variation by states and local areas. To comply with ACIP recommendations and increase coverage, delivery hospitals should provide hepatitis B vaccination of newborns as a standard of care.

Serologic markers for HBV—HBsAg (hepatitis B surface antigen), anti-HBc immunoglobulin M (IgM), anti-HBc immunoglobulin G (IgG), and anti-HBs (antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen)—are interpreted as follows: Self-limited infections are usually eliminated in 1 to 2 months, whereas chronic infections are persistently positive beyond 6 months with no detectable anti-HBs in individuals who have never been vaccinated; anti-HBc IgM appears 1 to 2 weeks after HBsAg; anti-HBc IgG persists for life and passively transferred maternal anti-HBc IgG is detectable in infants up to 24 months after birth; anti-HBs develops during convalescence in self-limited infections, indicates immunity from HBV infection, and after post–recovery from natural infection both anti-HBs and anti-HBc IgG are present, whereas after postvaccination without prior infection detectable anti-HBs but no anti-HBc or HBsAg are present, and inadvertent vaccination after recovery from HBV infection yields detectable anti-HBs and anti-HBc upon postvaccination testing.

Key points
- Hepatitis B is a disease caused by infection with the hepatitis B virus.
- Chronic infection with HBV causes serious liver disease, which can lead to death.
- Most chronic HBV infections result from infections acquired in infancy and early childhood.
- Hepatitis B vaccination can prevent infections. Vaccination can prevent hepatitis B The hepatitis B vaccine has been available since the 1980s. The vaccine is safe and highly effective at preventing infection. At least 3 doses of hepatitis B vaccine are needed to prevent infection with the hepatitis B virus. The first dose should be given to babies within 24 hours of birth. After that, children need 2 to 3 additional doses for full protection. Terms to know There are two possible stages of hepatitis B: acute and chronic. The early stages of infection with hepatitis B virus are considered an acute infection.

If the acute infection is not resolved by the body’s defenses, long-term infection can ensue, and the infection becomes lifelong. This later stage is known as chronic HBV infection. Impacts Chronic HBV infection can cause serious health problems, including:
- Liver damage
- Cirrhosis
- Liver failure
- Liver cancer
- Death Millions of children are living with chronic HBV infection. This is because not all countries have a hepatitis B birth dose in their vaccination schedules. Furthermore, some countries have low vaccination rates for all 3 required doses. Economic impacts Hepatitis B causes significant economic burden on patients and their families. This hardship comes both from direct healthcare costs and indirect costs, such as loss of income due to illness. Complications from chronic HBV infection occur later in adult years when individuals are working age and contributing most to the economy.

Therefore, the indirect costs of hepatitis B affect the economy of their entire community. Who is at risk. Mother-to-child transmission of HBV is the primary source of chronic HBV infections. Nearly all newborns who become infected at birth will develop chronic HBV infections. Keep ReadingLearn more about how people get hepatitis B.

### Hepatitis B vaccine (recombinant) (Engerix-B) [^ed56e0e4]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

Reduced Risk of Hepatocellular Carcinoma:

According to the CDC, the hepatitis B vaccine is recognized as the first anti-cancer vaccine because it can prevent primary liver cancer.3

A clear link has been demonstrated between chronic hepatitis B infection and the occurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma. In a Taiwanese study, the institution of universal childhood immunization against hepatitis B virus has been shown to decrease the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma among children.4In a Korean study in adult males, vaccination against hepatitis B virus has been shown to decrease the incidence of, and risk of, developing hepatocellular carcinoma in adults.5

Considering the serious consequences of infection, immunization should be considered for all persons at potential risk of exposure to the hepatitis B virus. Mothers infected with hepatitis B virus can infect their infants at, or shortly after, birth if they are carriers of the HBsAg antigen or develop an active infection during the third trimester of pregnancy. Infected infants usually become chronic carriers. Therefore, screening of pregnant women for hepatitis B is recommended.1Because a vaccination strategy limited to high-risk individuals has failed to substantially lower the overall incidence of hepatitis B infection, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends vaccination of all persons from birth to age 18.6The Committee on Infectious Diseases of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has also endorsed universal infant immunization as part of a comprehensive strategy for the control of hepatitis B infection.7The AAP, American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), and American Medical Association (AMA) also recommend routine vaccination of adolescents 11 to 12 years of age who have not been vaccinated previously.8The AAP further recommends that providers administer hepatitis B vaccine to all previously unvaccinated adolescents.9(See INDICATIONS AND USAGE.) There is no specific treatment for acute hepatitis B infection. However, those who develop anti-HBs antibodies after active infection are usually protected against subsequent infection. Antibody titers ≥10 mIU/mL against HBsAg are recognized as conferring protection against hepatitis B.1Seroconversion is defined as antibody titers ≥1 mIU/mL.

Correlates of protection against HBV infection

An anti-HBs IgG concentration <10 mIU/ml after a primary course of HBV vaccine predicts future vaccine failure.To what extent this is due to protection mediated by these antibodies rather than being simply a marker of the strength of vaccine response is not known.

In Gambian children vaccinated in infancy and then followed to age 7 years, waning of anti-HBs concentrations was associated with increased risk of core antibody reversion, a marker of transient infection.However, multiple studies of children vaccinated in infancy in high-prevalence countries, some with more than 20 years follow-up, have shown that children who initially responded to immunisation remain protected against HBV infection even if anti-HBs concentrations fall below 10 mIU/ml.A growing body of evidence suggests this may be true in low-prevalence countries as well.This protection is thought to be mediated by cell-mediated immunityand/or anamnestic antibody responses.

Citing these observational data, the European Consensus Statement on hepatitis B vaccine booster doses states that there is no evidence to support the use of boosters in immunocompetent children or adolescents.

Many studies have used a dose of HBV vaccine as a probe to assess immunological memory, defined as a rise in anti-HBs concentrations from <10 mIU/ml to either >10 mIU/mlor >100 mIU/mlpostimmunisation. It is believed that individuals able to mount a memory response to vaccine would mount such a response in the context of natural HBV challenge. Given HBV's long latency period, it is argued that this should be sufficient to clear the infection.However, there is no published literature attempting to correlate memory defined in this manner with rates of subsequent breakthrough infection.

Therefore, there is a growing body of evidencesuggesting that protection against HBV infection persists after antibody wanes, and no data correlating loss of a ‘memory response’ following boosting with future susceptibility to chronic infection. Given the paucity of knowledge about correlates of long-term protection, active surveillance for breakthrough infections may be most informative. We support callsfor RCTs addressing the need for booster doses of HBV vaccine in children born to mothers with hepatitis B infection.

Postvaccination Serologic Testing

Serologic testing for immunity is not necessary after routine vaccination of infants, children, or adults.
Testing for anti-HBs after vaccination is recommended for the following persons whose subsequent clinical management depends on knowledge of their immune status (Box 7): BOX 7 Persons recommended to receive postvaccination serologic testing * following a complete series of HepB vaccination • Infants born to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)–positive mothers or mothers whose HBsAg status remains unknown (e.g. when a parent or person with lawful custody safely surrenders an infant confidentially shortly after birth infants safely surrendered at or shortly after birth) † • Health care personnel and public safety workers • Hemodialysis patients and others who might require outpatient hemodialysis (e.g. predialysis, peritoneal dialysis, and home dialysis) • HIV-infected persons • Other immunocompromised persons (e.g. hematopoietic stem-cell transplant recipients or persons receiving chemotherapy) • Sex partners of HBsAg-positive persons * Postvaccination serologic testing for persons other than infants born to HBsAg-positive (or HBsAg-unknown) mothers consists of anti-HBs. † Postvaccination serologic testing for infants born to HBsAg-positive (or HBsAg-unknown) mothers consists of anti-HBs and HBsAg. Persons with anti-HBs <10 mIU/mL after the primary vaccine series should be revaccinated. Infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers or mothers with an unknown HBsAg status should be revaccinated with a single dose of HepB vaccine and receive postvaccination serologic testing 1–2 months later. Infants whose anti-HBs remains <10 mIU/mL following single dose revaccination should receive two additional doses of HepB vaccine, followed by postvaccination serologic testing 1–2 months after the final dose. Based on clinical circumstances or family preference, HBsAg-negative infants with anti-HBs <10 mIU/mL may instead be revaccinated with a second, complete 3-dose series, followed by postvaccination serologic testing performed 1–2 months after the final dose of vaccine. For others with anti-HBs <10 mIU/mL after the primary series, administration of 3 additional HepB vaccine doses on an appropriate schedule, followed by anti-HBs testing 1–2 months after the final dose, is usually more practical than serologic testing after ≥1 dose of vaccine. infants born to HBsAg-positive women and infants born to women whose HBsAg status remains unknown (e.g. infants safely surrendered shortly after birth). Postvaccination serologic testing should consist of testing for anti-HBs and HBsAg; HCP and public safety workers at risk for blood or body fluid exposure; hemodialysis patients (and other persons who might require outpatient hemodialysis), HIV-infected persons, and other immunocompromised persons (e.g. hematopoietic stem-cell transplant recipients or persons receiving chemotherapy), to determine the need for revaccination and the type of follow-up testing; and sex partners of HBsAg-positive persons, to determine the need for revaccination and for other methods of protection against HBV infection.
Testing should be performed 1–2 months after administration of the final dose of the vaccine series using a method that allows determination of a protective concentration of anti-HBs (≥10 mIU/mL). Persons found to have anti-HBs concentrations of ≥10 mIU/mL after the primary vaccine series are considered to be immune. Immunocompetent persons have long-term protection and do not need further periodic testing to assess anti-HBs levels. Immunocompromised persons might need annual testing to assess anti-HBs concentrations (See Revaccination). Persons found to have anti-HBs concentrations of <10 mIU/mL after the primary vaccine series should be revaccinated. Administration of all doses in the second series, on an appropriate schedule, followed by anti-HBs testing 1–2 months after the final dose, is usually more practical than serologic testing after one or more doses of vaccine (except for when revaccinating infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers). Persons who do not have a protective concentration of anti-HBs after revaccination should be tested for HBsAg. If the HBsAg test result is positive, the person should receive appropriate management, and any household, sexual, or needle-sharing contacts should be identified and vaccinated. Prevaccination testing (consisting of anti-HBc, HBsAg, and anti-HBs) to identify infected persons is recommended for household, sexual, or needle-sharing contacts of HBsAg-positive persons; serologic testing should not be a barrier to vaccination, and the first HepB vaccine dose should be administered immediately after collection of the blood for serologic testing. Persons who test negative for HBsAg should be considered susceptible to HBV infection and should be counseled about precautions to prevent HBV infection and the need to obtain HBIG postexposure prophylaxis for any known or likely exposure to an HBsAg-positive source.
Testing HCP with documentation of complete HepB vaccination for anti-HBs upon hire or matriculation (i.e. pre-exposure assessment of prior response to HepB vaccination), followed by one or more additional doses of HepB vaccine for HCP with anti-HBs <10 mIU/mL, helps to ensure that HCP will be protected if they have an exposure to HBV-containing blood or body fluids.
Anti-HBs levels of ≥10 mIU/mL are generally considered seroprotective; however, different assays have different assay cutoff values based on which reported levels of anti-HBs might vary depending on the assay used. Refer to the package insert of the test for the determination of actual/correct levels of anti-HBs antibodies.

Children and adolescents with HIV—post-HepB vaccination serologic testing and initial screening states that due to the high prevalence of HBV infection, all infants, children, and adolescents with HIV should be tested for HBsAg as soon as possible after HIV diagnosis (strong, high). If there is no documentation of routine infant/child vaccination for hepatitis B, initial screening with the triple panel consisting of HBsAg, anti-HBs, and total antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc) will determine infection and immune status and guide clinical management. Anti-HBs titers should be evaluated 4 to 6 weeks after completion of the vaccination series (strong, moderate), and individuals with the isolated anti-HBc serologic profile should also be vaccinated for hepatitis B.

Prevention of HBV Infection and Eradication of HBV

Since the early 1980s, there has been a successful vaccine against HBV, which can prevent HBV infection by eliciting an immune response in 95% of vaccinees 144. The success of this vaccine was first demonstrated in Taiwan, which was one of the first countries to implement universal vaccination. HBsAg carrier rates in children decreased from 10% in 1984 to <1% in 2004, with a concomitant 68% decrease of acute liver failure in infants younger than 12 months, and a 75% reduction of HCC in children aged 6 to 14 years 42, 145. However, despite the effectiveness of this vaccine and the implementation of universal vaccination, following a recommendation by the World Health Organization (WHO) in the early 1990s, in over 184 countries, eradication of HBV is still not on the horizon.

To reduce MTCT the WHO recommends administration of both the vaccine and HBIg within 24 h of birth, which reduce transmission by 90% – 98% 1. Children of HBeAg‐positive mothers are at greater risk of developing chronic hepatitis even after immunization 146, and although administration of HBIg born to HBeAg‐negative mothers did not reduce the rate of chronic hepatitis, it can prevent infantile acute liver failure 146.

Active and passive immunoprophylaxis in children cannot prevent MTCT in 10% of children 147. The reasons for this outcome include:
Vaccination failure, often as a result of incomplete or delayed vaccination 148 high HBV DNA levels in mothers leading to in utero transmission. Vaccine escape mutations 148 Low response to vaccine and/or waning anti‐HBs levels 149, 150

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^aa15c17b]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). High credibility.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) transmission and vaccination—risk factors, program elements, and service-setting actions are outlined. HBV is efficiently transmitted by percutaneous or mucous membrane exposure to HBV-infected blood or body fluids that contain HBV, and among adolescents and adults primary risk factors include unprotected sex with an infected partner, having multiple partners, men having sex with men, having history of other STIs, and injecting drug use. CDC’s national strategy includes prevention of perinatal infection through routine screening of all pregnant women for HBsAg and immunoprophylaxis of infants born to mothers with HBsAg or mothers whose HBsAg status is unknown, routine infant vaccination, vaccination of previously unvaccinated children and adolescents through age 18 years, and vaccination of previously unvaccinated adults at increased risk for infection. Vaccination of persons as children and adolescents likely has led to improved vaccination coverage among adults aged <30 years with corresponding lower rates of acute HBV infection, whereas coverage among high-risk adults aged ≥30 years has remained low and these groups account for the highest rates of prevalence of acute HBV infection. STD clinics and other health care settings providing STI services to adults at high risk for infection should administer hepatitis B vaccine to those who are unvaccinated.
