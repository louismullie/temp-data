## Question

A 67-year-old man with STEMI-induced cardiogenic shock and baseline CKD (eGFR ~45) remains hypotensive on vasopressors. Based on DanGer Shock, would you favor a microaxial-flow pump, and how would you counsel on risks and benefits?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a microaxial flow pump (Impella CP) should be used for a 67-year-old man with STEMI-induced cardiogenic shock, persistent hypotension on vasopressors, and baseline CKD with eGFR ~45 mL/min/1.73 m², and how to counsel on risks and benefits. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the patient meets the DanGer Shock trial inclusion criteria. Then, I should verify the magnitude and direction of survival benefit from the randomized data. Next, I will examine renal-specific risks, including AKI and RRT, and whether baseline CKD modifies that risk. After that, I need to consider age-related treatment effects and vascular/access complications. Finally, I will integrate guideline positions and outline a practical, risk-mitigation plan for shared decision-making and monitoring if we proceed with the device [^55a8b28c] [^2f5d62dc].

> Let me first confirm eligibility against DanGer Shock, because external validity hinges on matching the trial population. Inclusion required STEMI with cardiogenic shock defined by hypotension (SBP < 100 mmHg or vasopressor need), hypoperfusion (lactate ≥ 2.5 mmol/L), and LVEF < 45%, with exclusion of comatose post-arrest patients, severe peripheral arterial disease, mechanical aortic valve, septic shock, or overt right ventricular failure; the device was placed early, often before PCI, and support was continued for at least 48 hours, which fits a patient with persistent vasopressor-refractory shock and adequate femoral anatomy [^55a8b28c] [^4fb83f7e] [^373c14fa].

> Wait, let me verify the primary outcome and its clinical significance. In DanGer Shock, 180-day all-cause mortality was 45.8% with Impella CP versus 58.5% with standard care, an absolute risk reduction of 12.7% and a relative risk reduction of 26% (HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.55–0.99; P = 0.04), translating to a number needed to treat of about 8, which is a meaningful survival benefit in this high-mortality condition [^55a8b28c] [^346895a3].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about renal risk; I need to check the AKI and RRT signals. The prespecified renal analysis showed higher AKI incidence with Impella (61% vs 45%) and more RRT (42% vs 27%), with most RRT starts within 24 hours; importantly, despite more RRT, mortality remained lower in the Impella arm, and no survivor at 180 days remained on dialysis, suggesting that the excess RRT reflects hemodynamic trade-offs rather than a paradoxical harm signal [^954d4042] [^46dc43c2] [^807dd277].

> I should double-check whether baseline CKD alters the AKI risk with Impella. Exploratory analyses indicate that lower eGFR predicts AKI overall, but the excess AKI risk attributable to Impella diminishes as baseline eGFR falls, such that patients with reduced kidney function may have a relatively smaller incremental AKI risk from the device compared with those with preserved eGFR; this does not eliminate risk, but it tempers the relative penalty in CKD patients [^1c8c9abb] [^ca0ef7c0].

> Next, I should review age-related considerations. A post hoc age analysis suggests the survival benefit of Impella is concentrated in patients younger than about 77 years, with no clear benefit and possible harm in those 77 and older; at 67, this patient sits in the age stratum where benefit is most consistent, though I must emphasize the exploratory nature of this subgroup finding [^7a8f92cd] [^85accee1].

> I will now examine hemodynamic and metabolic correlates that might explain benefit despite renal complications. A substudy showed that Impella reduced vasopressor/inotrope requirements while maintaining MAP and accelerated lactate clearance by roughly 12 hours compared with standard care, consistent with improved systemic perfusion and ventricular unloading; this mechanistic signal supports a physiologic rationale for survival benefit even in the face of device-related complications [^2e79feaa] [^e9aeaacb].

> But wait, what about access and bleeding risks that could compound renal injury. The trial reported more major bleeding and vascular complications with Impella, including limb ischemia, which are nontrivial and require meticulous femoral access technique, ultrasound/fluoroscopy guidance, and vigilant anticoagulation management; these complications can themselves worsen renal outcomes, so prevention and early detection are essential [^55a8b28c] [^511e8c7f].

> Next, I should review guideline positioning to ensure alignment. Contemporary ACC/AHA/ACEP guidance gives a Class IIa, Level B-R recommendation to consider a microaxial intravascular flow pump in selected STEMI patients with severe or refractory cardiogenic shock who match DanGer Shock features, explicitly noting higher rates of bleeding, limb ischemia, and renal failure and emphasizing careful patient selection and weaning strategies; this supports offering the device in this scenario with informed consent [^2f5d62dc] [^4259ada3] [^36886448].

> Let me synthesize the risk–benefit balance for this specific patient. Benefits include a 12.7% absolute reduction in 180-day mortality in a population with ~50–60% expected mortality, faster lactate clearance, and reduced pharmacologic support; risks include higher AKI and RRT, bleeding, and limb ischemia, with the renal signal partly offset by the fact that survivors are not left on dialysis and that the relative AKI excess from Impella appears smaller in CKD patients; given age 67 and persistent shock on vasopressors, the net clinical benefit favors Impella if the team can mitigate complications [^55a8b28c] [^954d4042] [^1c8c9abb].

> I should confirm practical steps to reduce renal and vascular harm if we proceed. Early involvement of nephrology, strict fluid balance targets, avoidance of nephrotoxins, close monitoring for hemolysis and suction events with prompt pump-speed adjustments, and a plan to minimize device duration with timely weaning are prudent; additionally, using best-practice femoral access techniques and considering alternative access strategies in high-risk anatomy can reduce ischemic complications that worsen renal outcomes [^b2396897] [^511e8c7f] [^135a533e].

> Hold on, I should verify that we are not overgeneralizing beyond the evidence. The benefit is clearest in STEMI-CS patients who are not comatose, without overt RV failure, and with suitable femoral anatomy; outside these parameters, evidence is weaker or conflicting, so shared decision-making should explicitly acknowledge uncertainty and the need for expert centers and protocols [^55a8b28c] [^4010d8dd].

> Final recommendation: Yes, I would favor early microaxial flow pump support in this 67-year-old with STEMI-induced cardiogenic shock and baseline CKD, provided the team can deliver the same rigor as DanGer Shock — early device placement, careful access, vigilant anticoagulation, and proactive AKI prevention — because the randomized evidence shows a meaningful survival benefit that outweighs the increased risk of AKI/RRT in appropriately selected patients, especially those under about 77 years old [^55a8b28c] [^7a8f92cd] [^2f5d62dc].

Based on the DanGer Shock trial, a microaxial flow pump (Impella CP) is **reasonable to consider** for a 67-year-old with STEMI-induced cardiogenic shock and CKD (eGFR ~45) who remains hypotensive on vasopressors, as it reduced 180-day mortality by 26% (HR 0.74) in selected STEMI-CS patients [^55a8b28c] [^2f5d62dc]. However, **renal risk is higher**: AKI occurred in 61% vs 45% and RRT in 42% vs 27% with Impella vs standard care, and baseline CKD further increases AKI risk [^954d4042] [^1c8c9abb]. The survival benefit persisted despite AKI, and no survivors required chronic dialysis at 180 days [^807dd277]. Use is best in patients < 77 years, with careful attention to access, anticoagulation, and early device weaning to mitigate complications [^7a8f92cd] [^4259ada3].

## Clinical evidence from the DanGer Shock trial

- **Trial design**: multicenter, randomized, open-label; 355 patients with STEMI-CS; Impella CP plus standard care vs standard care alone [^55a8b28c].
- **Primary outcome**: 180-day mortality was lower with Impella (45.8% vs 58.5%; HR 0.74; 95% CI 0.55–0.99; P = 0.04) [^55a8b28c].
- **Renal outcomes**: AKI occurred in 61% vs 45% and RRT in 42% vs 27% with Impella vs standard care, respectively [^954d4042].
- **Survival despite AKI**: mortality benefit persisted irrespective of AKI or RRT, and no survivors required chronic dialysis at 180 days [^807dd277].

---

## Applicability to patients with baseline CKD

- **Baseline CKD risk**: lower eGFR predicts AKI in cardiogenic shock, but the incremental AKI risk from Impella diminishes as eGFR declines [^1c8c9abb].
- **Relative risk**: patients with eGFR ~45 have a smaller relative increase in AKI with Impella than those with normal renal function, though absolute risk remains higher [^notfound].
- **Outcomes**: despite more AKI/RRT, survival was better with Impella even in patients with baseline CKD, and no survivors remained on dialysis at 180 days [^807dd277].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current ACC/AHA/ACEP guidelines give a **Class IIa recommendation** for Impella in selected STEMI-CS patients, balancing mortality benefit against higher risks of bleeding, limb ischemia, and renal failure [^2f5d62dc] [^4259ada3]. They emphasize careful patient selection, meticulous vascular access, and proactive complication management [^4259ada3].

---

## Patient-specific risk-benefit analysis

| **Benefits** | **Risks** |
|-|-|
| 26% relative reduction in 180-day mortality (absolute risk reduction 12.7%) [^55a8b28c] | Higher incidence of AKI and RRT (42% vs 27%) [^954d4042] |
| Improved hemodynamic stability and faster lactate clearance [^2e79feaa] | Increased risk of bleeding, limb ischemia, and device-related complications [^55a8b28c] |
| Survival benefit persists despite AKI or RRT [^807dd277] | Baseline CKD increases susceptibility to AKI [^1c8c9abb] |

---

## Practical considerations and mitigation strategies

- **Patient selection**: prioritize patients < 77 years, without severe peripheral vascular disease, and with appropriate femoral anatomy [^7a8f92cd].
- **Procedural planning**: use ultrasound/fluoroscopy for access, consider axillary access for prolonged support, and minimize device duration [^135a533e] [^b4a324b3].
- **Renal protection**: avoid nephrotoxins, monitor renal function closely, and involve nephrology early [^notfound].
- **Anticoagulation**: titrate to minimize bleeding while preventing thrombosis [^notfound].
- **Weaning strategy**: plan early weaning once hemodynamics improve to reduce complications [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

In a 67-year-old with STEMI-CS, persistent hypotension on vasopressors, and CKD (eGFR ~45), **Impella CP is reasonable** given the 26% mortality reduction in DanGer Shock, with the understanding that AKI and RRT are more likely but survival remains improved and chronic dialysis is uncommon among survivors [^55a8b28c] [^807dd277]. Use is best in patients < 77 years, with careful attention to access, anticoagulation, and early weaning to mitigate complications [^7a8f92cd] [^4259ada3].

Study Design

DanGer Shock was an international, multicenter, randomized, open-label trial conducted in Denmark, Germany, and the United Kingdom. Detailed information about the trial design, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and statistical analysis plan are provided in the main study report and adjacent previous publications. The trial protocol was approved by the ethics committee at each participating site and the participants gave informed consent.

Patients ≥ 18 years of age with STEMI were included between 2013 and 2023 if they had CS, defined by hypotension (systolic blood pressure < 100 mm Hg or need for vasopressor support), arterial lactate of ≥ 2.5 mmol/L, and left ventricular ejection fraction < 45%. Key exclusion criteria were comatose out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, severe peripheral arterial obstructive disease, mechanical aortic valve prosthesis, septic shock, or right ventricular failure. Participants were randomized 1:1 to undergo either unloading with a mAFP (Impella CP; Abiomed, Johnson & Johnson Med Tech) plus standard of care or standard of care alone. Patients could be randomized before revascularization, while in the catheterization laboratory, or up to 12 hours after revascularization, depending on when shock criteria were met.

Key Points

Question

Does systolic blood pressure (SBP) modify the survival benefit of microaxial flow pump therapy in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction–related cardiogenic shock?

Findings

In this post hoc analysis of the DanGer Shock randomized clinical trial including 351 patients, SBP at randomization significantly modified the survival benefit of microaxial flow pump therapy, with benefit most pronounced in patients with the lowest SBPs. Adverse events occurred independently of SBP at randomization.

Meaning

Early SBP may help identify patients most likely to derive a net benefit from microaxial flow pump treatment in infarct-related cardiogenic shock.

BACKGROUND:

In DanGer Shock (the Danish–German Cardiogenic Shock trial), use of a microaxial flow pump (mAFP) in patients with ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction–related cardiogenic shock led to lower all-cause mortality but higher rates of renal replacement therapy (RRT). In this prespecified analysis, rates and predictors of acute kidney injury (AKI) and RRT were assessed.

METHODS:

In this international, randomized, open-label, multicenter trial, 355 adult patients with ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction–related cardiogenic shock were randomized to mAFP (n = 179) or standard care alone (n = 176). AKI was defined according to RIFLE criteria (Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, and End-stage kidney disease) and assessed using logistic regression models. Use of RRT was assessed accounting for the competing risk of death using Fine-Gray subdistribution hazard models.

RESULTS:

AKI (RIFLE ≥ 1) was recorded in 110 patients (61%) in the mAFP group and 79 patients (45%) in the control group (P < 0.01); RRT was used in 75 (42%) and 47 (27%) patients, respectively (P < 0.01). About two-thirds of the RRTs were initiated within the first 24 hours from admission (n = 48 [64%] in the mAFP group and n = 31 [66%] in the control group). Occurrence of AKI and RRT were associated with higher 180-day mortality in both study arms. At 180 days, all patients alive were free of RRT. mAFP use was associated with higher rates of RRT, even when accounting for competing risk of death (subdistribution hazard, 1.67 [1.18–2.35]). This association was largely consistent among prespecified subgroups. Allocation to mAFP was associated with lower 180-day mortality irrespective of AKI or RRT (P interaction = 0.84). Relevant predictors of AKI in both groups comprised reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, baseline kidney function, shock severity, bleeding events, and positive fluid balance. Predictors of AKI specific to mAFP were suction events, higher pump speed, and longer duration of support.

CONCLUSIONS:

Shock severity, allocation to mAFP, and device-related complications were associated with an increased risk of AKI. AKI was generally associated with higher mortality, but the allocation to mAFP consistently led to lower mortality rates at 180 days irrespective of the occurrence of AKI with or without RRT initiation.

AKI- and RRT-Related Survival in Patients With STEMI-CS in DanGer Shock

In line with other observational and nonobservational trials, AKI and RRT were associated with higher mortality at 180 days in the DanGer Shock population. The current analysis shows that mAFP use increased the risk of AKI and RRT in selected patients with STEMI-CS, even when accounting for competing risks. However, despite this increased risk, mAFP use increased survival in patients with and without AKI or RRT as indicated by the subgroup analysis. The results of the mediation analysis should be interpreted with caution as this analysis was not prespecified and may be subject to potential survivor bias. In addition, none of the survivors in the study required dialysis at the end of follow-up at 180 days. These data suggest that rather than avoiding the use of mAFP for fear of AKI, a better approach for clinicians and researchers may be to focus on strategies to minimize the risks and complications associated with mAFP use. The current analysis of predictors of AKI, particularly in the mAFP group, may help identify such strategies.

DanGer-SHOCK trial — microaxial flow pump in STEMI cardiogenic shock: In ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) with cardiogenic shock of < 24 hours defined by hypotension (SBP < 100 mm Hg or vasopressor support), end-organ hypoperfusion (arterial lactate ≥ 2.5 mmol/L and/or SvO2 ≤ 56% with a normal PaO2), and LVEF < 45%, 360 patients at 14 centers were randomized to a microaxial flow pump versus standard care; the device significantly reduced all-cause mortality at 180 days by 26% (HR, 0.74 [95% CI, 0.55–0.99]; P = 0.04; absolute risk reduction, 12.7%; number needed to treat = 8). Patients who were comatose (Glasgow Coma Scale score < 8) and those with overt right ventricular failure were excluded, and use of a microaxial flow pump is reasonable to reduce mortality in patients whose clinical features match the trial's inclusion criteria; in particular, SCAI shock stages C, D, or E who are noncomatose and have adequate peripheral vasculature to accommodate large-bore access are reasonable candidates.

Cardiogenic shock after acute myocardial infarction — microaxial flow pump: Based on one trial, use of the microaxial flow pump in selected patients with cardiogenic shock related to acute myocardial infarction is reasonable to reduce death, but complications such as bleeding, limb ischemia, and renal failure are higher with the microaxial flow pump compared with usual care, so careful attention to vascular access and weaning of support is important to appropriately balance the benefits and risks.

Conclusions

In patients with STEMI-CS, shock severity, allocation to mAFP, and device-related complications were associated with an increased risk of AKI. AKI was generally associated with higher mortality rates, but the allocation to mAFP consistently led to lower mortality rates at 180 days irrespective of the occurrence of AKI with or without RRT initiation. Addressing mechanisms of AKI, such as bleeding, suction events, and excessive mAFP unloading, may further improve the treatment effects of mAFP.

Clinical Perspective

Editorial, see p

Cardiogenic shock (CS) is a clinical syndrome defined as hypotension and hypoperfusion attributable to cardiac dysfunction. CS can occur as a complication of ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)and is associated with a high in-hospital mortality rate of 40% to 60% depending on the definition of shock. –

Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs frequently in CS, and is one of the strongest predictors of in-hospital death in CS, particularly in CS due to acute myocardial infarction. Mechanisms involve hypoperfusion, renal venous congestion, systemic inflammation, sepsis, neurohumoral activation, and volume extravasation. In addition, therapy with vasopressors and inotropes has been associated with AKI. Specific treatment options and recommendations beyond standard management of CS, careful fluid management, and timing of renal replacement therapy (RRT) are not available.

DanGer Shock (the Danish-German Cardiogenic Shock trial) compared the safety and efficacy of use of a microaxial flow pump (mAFP) in addition to standard care with standard care alone in the treatment of patients with STEMI-related CS (STEMI-CS). The trial documented a lower risk of all-cause death at 180 days in the mAFP group. However, complication rates were higher in the mAFP group. Besides bleeding events and limb ischemia, the incidence of RRT was higher in the treatment group.

In this prespecified analysis, we sought to provide a detailed evaluation of incidence, outcomes, and possible underlying factors for AKI and the use of RRT in patients with STEMI-CS enrolled in DanGer Shock.

DanGer-SHOCK — microaxial flow pump in STEMI cardiogenic shock: Patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and cardiogenic shock of < 24 hours duration defined by hypotension and hypoperfusion thresholds were randomized to a microaxial flow pump versus standard care, and use of the pump significantly reduced all-cause mortality at 180 days; use of a microaxial flow pump is reasonable in patients matching the trial criteria. The study enrolled 360 patients at 14 specialized centers and excluded comatose patients after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and those with overt right ventricular failure, with inclusion thresholds of SBP < 100 mm Hg (or vasopressor support), arterial lactate ≥ 2.5 mmol/L and/or SvO2 ≤ 55% with a normal PaO2, and LVEF < 45%. Mortality was reduced by 26% (HR, 0.74 [95% CI, 0.55–0.99]; P = 0.04; absolute risk reduction, 12.7%; number needed to treat = 8) at 180 days. Based on these results, use of a microaxial flow pump is reasonable to reduce mortality in patients with STEMI and cardiogenic shock who have clinical features consistent with the inclusion criteria of the DanGer-SHOCK trial, and patients with SCAI shock stages C, D, or E who are noncomatose with adequate peripheral vasculature are reasonable candidates for the microaxial flow pump.

Results

Baseline Characteristics of Patients With and Without Renal End Points

Of all study participants, 189 (53%) had AKI, including 110 (61%) in the mAFP group and 79 (45%) in the control group (P < 0.01), and 122 (34%) required RRT (mAFP, 75 [42%] versus control, 47 [27%]; P < 0.01; Figure 1).

Figure 1.
Risk of acute kidney injury and renal replacement therapy in both study arms. A, Unadjusted cumulative risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) according to RIFLE criteria (Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, and End-stage kidney disease). B, Unadjusted cumulative incidence of renal replacement therapy until 30 days after randomization (Gray test adjusting for competing risk of death). mAFP indicates microaxial flow pump.

At admission, compared with patients with CS who did not develop AKI, those who later developed AKI presented with higher heart rate, higher creatinine levels, and more advanced SCAI shock stages (Table 1). Most of these differences were consistent among study participants in both study arms (Table 1).

Table 1.
Baseline Characteristics of Patients Developing AKI in Both Study Arms

The differences in baseline characteristics between patients who later received RRT and those who did not undergo RRT were similar, but study participants who later received RRT were also younger and more likely to be male. Again, most of these differences were also consistent when the groups were stratified by study intervention.

Temporary mechanical circulatory support in STEMI-related cardiogenic shock — trial evidence indicates that the Danish-German Cardiogenic Shock (DanGer Shock) trial showed that early use of a microaxial flow pump in select patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction–related shock improved 180-day survival as compared with standard of care.

Introduction

Cardiogenic shock (CS) remains a frequent complication of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), carrying a poor prognosis with short-term mortality rates of 40% to 50%. AMI-CS pathophysiology is characterized by inadequate tissue perfusion due to an acutely failing heart. As a marker of hemodynamic compromise, hypotension is a central diagnostic criterion and serves as a standard treatment target. After nearly a decade of sparse progression in evidence-based AMI-CS treatment, the Danish-German (DanGer) Shock randomized clinical trial demonstrated a significant reduction in 180-day mortality with routine use of a microaxial flow pump in selected patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) complicated by CS (STEMI-CS). However, the survival benefit came with an increased risk of complications, such as moderate or severe bleeding, limb ischemia, acute kidney injury (AKI), and stroke. Subgroup analysis of the DanGer Shock trial, as well as emerging evidence, has suggested specific patient subgroups with altered risk-benefit profiles. A recent individual patient data meta-analysis suggested an interaction between systolic blood pressure (SBP) at randomization and the survival effect of mechanical circulatory support (MCS).

In this post hoc analysis of the DanGer Shock trial, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the impact of SBP at randomization on 180-day all-cause mortality, on microaxial flow pump–associated survival benefit, and on risk of adverse treatment events.

Incidence of AKI and RRT Based on Treatment Allocation

The majority of RRTs were initiated within the first 24 hours from admission (48 patients [64%] in the mAFP group, 31 patients [66%] in the control group). The probability of AKI and RRT was higher in the mAFP group (Figure 1). mAFP use was also associated with higher serum creatinine levels during the first 72 hours compared with controls in the full study population, in the subgroup of 180-day survivors only, and in the subgroup of those who did not receive RRT during the first 72 hours after admission (Figure 2). Use of diuretic stress tests and previous use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are shown in. The vasoactive–inotropic score was higher in the standard of care group during first hours in the intensive care unit.

### Microaxial flow pump hemodynamic and metabolic effects in infarct-related cardiogenic shock: a substudy of the danGer shock randomized clinical trial [^6a1e06e6]. JAMA Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

The study DanGer Shock (secondary analysis) was published by Nanna Louise Junker Udesen and colleagues in 2024 in the journal JAMA Cardiol. This study is related to the following diseases: Cardiogenic shock and ST-elevation myocardial infarction. In the DanGer Shock (secondary analysis) study, the trial question was: what is the role of microaxial flow pump in patients with STEMI-induced cardiogenic shock? In the DanGer Shock (secondary analysis) study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the DanGer Shock (secondary analysis) study, the population was: 355 patients (74 female, 281 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with STEMI-induced cardiogenic shock. The key exclusion criteria were comatose state after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest; mechanical complication to ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction; RV failure. In the DanGer Shock (secondary analysis) study, the interventions were: n = 179 microaxial flow pump (treatment with a catheter-based percutaneous transvalvular microaxial flow pump [Impella CP®] for a minimum of 48 hours) n = 176 standard care (treatment with conventional circulatory support and observed in ICU for a minimum of 48 hours). In the DanGer Shock (secondary analysis) study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in AKI (61% vs. 45%; OR 1.96, 96% CI 1.29 to 3). In the DanGer Shock (secondary analysis) study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in RRT (42% vs. 27%; AD 15%, 95% CI 3.58 to 26.42) Significant decrease in death at day 180 in patients with AKI (54% vs. 68%; OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.93) Significant increase in median serum creatinine among survivors (127 mcmol/L vs. 100 mcmol/L; AD 27 mcmol/L, 95% CI 10.98 to 43.02). In the DanGer Shock (secondary analysis) study, the conclusion was: in patients with STEMI-induced cardiogenic shock, microaxial flow pump was inferior to standard care with respect to AKI.

### Microaxial flow pump use and renal outcomes in infarct-related cardiogenic shock: a secondary analysis of the danGer shock trial [^350197f3]. Circulation (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This analysis provides several insights into the specific risk of AKI and RRT associated with the use of mAFP in patients with STEMI-CS. Shock severity, bleeding, baseline eGFR, and allocation to mAFP were associated with an increased risk of AKI. in addition, specifically in the mAFP group, suction events, high mAFP performance levels, and longer duration of support were also associated with an increased risk of AKI. Whereas AKI occurrence was generally associated with higher mortality, allocation to mAFP was associated with comparable relative survival benefit regardless of whether patients experienced AKI or RRT.

AKI is a frequent complication in CS, often leading to the requirement of RRT, and is a well-established predictor of mortality in patients with STEMI-CS. The prevalence of AKI in the current study, even in the control arm, was higher than that reported in other contemporary acute myocardial infarction–related CS trials, which may be due to differences in study design, among other factors. – Most CS trials did not record or report the incidence of AKI, but the IABP-SHOCK-II (Intraaortic Balloon Pump in Cardiogenic Shock II), CULPRIT-SHOCK (Culprit Lesion Only PCI versus Multivessel PCI in Cardiogenic Shock), and ECLS-SHOCK (Extracorporeal Life Support in Cardiogenic Shock) shock trials have reported the rates of RRT. – The rates of RRT were significantly lower in IABP-SHOCK-II (20.6% in the intra-aortic balloon pump arm, 15.7% in the control arm; risk ratio [RR], 1.31), CULPRIT-SHOCK (overall 14.0%), and ECLS-SHOCK (8.1% in the extracorporeal life support [ECLS] arm, 13.9% in the control arm; RR, 0.58) compared with both study arms in DanGer Shock (41.9% in the mAFP arm, 26.7% in the control arm; RR, 1.57).– The differences in RRT initiation rates in the control arms of these trials reflect the differences of the underlying trial populations, as reviewed previously. Nevertheless, the magnitude of the RRs within each respective trial hints toward intrinsic pathophysiologic mechanisms specific for the mAFP, which could lead to the reported higher rates of RRT in DanGer Shock. This risk difference associated with mAFP use in CS is in line with previous observational studies. For example, Schrage et alreport an RR of 1.50 for RRT use in patients treated with ECLS and mAFP compared with those treated with ECLS alone.

### Microaxial flow pump or standard care in infarct-related cardiogenic shock [^55a8b28c]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

The study DanGer Shock (original research) was published by Jacob E Møller and colleagues in 2024 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Cardiogenic shock and ST-elevation myocardial infarction. In the DanGer Shock (original research) study, the trial question was: what is the role of microaxial flow pump in patients with STEMI-induced cardiogenic shock? In the DanGer Shock (original research) study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the DanGer Shock (original research) study, the population was: 355 patients (74 female, 281 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with STEMI-induced cardiogenic shock. The key exclusion criteria were overt RV failure; resuscitation from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and comatose on arrival to the cardiac catheterization laboratory. In the DanGer Shock (original research) study, the interventions were: n = 179 microaxial flow pump (treatment with a catheter-based percutaneous transvalvular microaxial flow pump [Impella CP®] plus standard care) n = 176 standard care (standard care alone). In the DanGer Shock (original research) study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in death from any cause at day 180 (45.8% vs. 58.5%; HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.99). In the DanGer Shock (original research) study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in composite end-point of escalation of treatment to additional mechanical circulatory support, heart transplantation, or death from any cause (52.5% vs. 63.6%; HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.95) No significant difference in the number of days alive and out of hospital (82 days vs. 73 days; AD 8 days, 95% CI -8 to 25). In the DanGer Shock (original research) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in stroke. significant differences in severe bleeding, limb ischemia, hemolysis, device failure, or worsening aortic regurgitation (24.0% vs. 6.2%). In the DanGer Shock (original research) study, the conclusion was: in patients with STEMI-induced cardiogenic shock, microaxial flow pump was superior to standard care with respect to death from any cause at day 180.

### Microaxial flow pump use and renal outcomes in infarct-related cardiogenic shock: a secondary analysis of the danGer shock trial [^21c21942]. Circulation (2024). Medium credibility.

To assess the associations of candidate exposures and admission and postadmission predictors with these outcomes, univariable logistic regression and Fine-Gray models were used for AKI and RRT, respectively. Resulting associations are reported as odds ratios (ORs) or subdistribution hazard ratios with the corresponding 95% CIs, respectively. Skewed variables were log-transformed before regression to approximate normal distribution and resulting ORs or subdistribution hazard ratios are reported by 10% increase.

Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated according to the CKD-EPI formula (Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration) in its most recent update from 2021. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate the relationship between eGFR at randomization and the risk of AKI, considering potential interactions with allocation. For illustration, we then plotted the risk of AKI across the range of eGFR, first stratified by treatment group and then including the treatment group as a predictor to show the treatment effect (mAFP versus standard) on the risk of AKI as a function of baseline eGFR with 95% CIs. Restricted cubic splines were initially used to assess potential nonlinear associations between eGFR and the risk of AKI in both study arms. However, a simpler model without splines adequately captured the relationship.

An exploratory analysis was performed only within the mAFP group to assess whether higher mAFP performance levels were associated with hemolysis and subsequent kidney injury. For this, linear regression models were generated with total bilirubin at 24 hours and serum creatinine at 48 hours as outcome variables and mAFP performance levels as predictors, stratified by higher levels (7 to 9) or lower levels of support (1 to 6). These associations were tested in univariate and multivariate regression models, the latter adjusted for the potential confounders age as well as left ventricular ejection fraction and admission lactate level as surrogates of CS severity.

Society for Cardiovascular Angiography & Interventions (SCAI) shock stage was assessed after completion of the study but before unblinding according to the Cardiogenic Shock Working Group approach. The vasoactive–inotropic score was calculated as previously describedand square root transformed for regression modeling. A 2-sided α level of 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses and plots were conducted using R software, version 4.4.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing). Dr Møller had full access to all the data in the study and takes responsibility for its integrity and the data analysis.

### Sex-specific microaxial flow pump use and outcomes in infarct-related cardiogenic shock in the danGer shock trial [^108594e8]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The microaxial flow pump (mAFP) has been shown to improve outcomes in selected patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and cardiogenic shock (STEMI-CS), but this effect appears to be less evident in women compared with men.

Objectives

The objective of this secondary analysis of the Danish-German Cardiogenic Shock Trial (DanGer Shock) was to determine sex differences in baseline characteristics, in-hospital course, and the effectiveness of mAFP in STEMI-CS.

Methods

This was a prespecified sex-specific secondary analysis of the international, multicenter, open-label, randomized DanGer Shock Trial. The primary outcome was 180-day all-cause mortality, analyzed by sex and randomized treatment assignment.

Results

From 2013 to 2023, 355 patients (74 [20.8%] women, 281 [79.2%] men) with STEMI-CS excluding comatose cardiac arrest were enrolled; 179 were randomized to mAFP (37 women) and 176 to standard care (37 women). In an accompanying registry of excluded patients (n = 495), women represented 25.7% (P = 0.10). At baseline, women were significantly older, and time from symptom onset to randomization was 2.2-fold longer in women than in men. Compared with men, women had significantly higher 180-day all-cause mortality (64.9% vs 48.8%; P = 0.015). There was no significant interaction for sex and treatment assignment with respect to 180-day all-cause mortality (P value for interaction = 0.18), yet women (HR: 1.01 [95% CI: 0.58–1.79]) appeared to derive less benefit from mAFP treatment than male patients (HR: 0.66 [95% CI: 0.47–0.93]). This difference was attenuated in patients aged ≤ 76 years: women (n = 41) HR: 0.66 (95% CI: 0.25–1.76) and men (n = 233) HR: 0.61 (95% CI: 0.40–0.92) (P value for interaction = 0.92). Data from up to 10 years of follow-up support the treatment effect in younger patients, regardless of sex: women HR: 0.45 (95% CI: 0.19–1.09); men HR: 0.57 (95% CI: 0.40–0.82).

Conclusions

In DanGer Shock, women with STEMI-CS were older and presented later after onset of symptoms, resulting in higher mortality rates. This may have led to the apparent reduced treatment effect in women, but interaction between treatment allocation and sex was not significant, and data showing a benefit of mAFP appeared particularly in younger patients, regardless of sex. As this is a secondary, nonpowered analysis that includes few women, its results must be considered hypothesis generating. (Danish Cardiogenic Shock Trial [DanShock]; NCT01633502).

### Treating older patients in cardiogenic shock with a microaxial flow pump: is it DANGERous? [^7a8f92cd]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Whether age impacts the recently demonstrated survival benefit of microaxial flow pump (mAFP) treatment in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and cardiogenic shock (CS) is unknown.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of age on mortality and complication rates in patients with STEMI-related CS randomized to standard care or mAFP on top of standard care.

Methods

This is a secondary analysis of the Danish-German Cardiogenic Shock (DanGer Shock) trial, an international, multicenter, open-label trial, in which 355 adult patients with STEMI-related CS were randomized to receive an mAFP (Impella CP) plus standard care or standard care alone. The primary outcome of 180-day all-cause mortality is analyzed according to age and intervention.

Results

From lowest to highest age quartile, the median ages (range) were 54 years (Q1-Q3: 31–59 years), 65 years (Q1-Q3: 60–69 years), 73 years (Q1-Q3: 70–76 years), and 81 years (Q1-Q3: 77–92 years). There were no differences in blood pressure, lactate level, left ventricular ejection fraction, or shock severity at randomization across age groups. Mortality increased from lowest to highest quartile (31%, 47%, 61%, and 73%, respectively; log-rank P < 0.001), with an adjusted OR for death at 180 days of 7.85 (95% CI: 3.37–19.2; P < 0.001) in the highest quartile compared to the lowest. The predicted risk of mortality was higher in the standard-care group until approximately 77 years, after which the predicted risk became higher in the mAFP group (P = 0.20). In patients < 77 years, a reduced 180-day mortality was observed in patients randomized to the mAFP (OR: 0.45; 95% CI: 0.28–0.73; P = 0.001), opposed to patients aged ≥ 77 years (OR: 1.52; 95% CI: 0.57–4.08; P = 0.40), P for interaction = 0.028. Complications were more frequent in the mAFP group, but there were no apparent differences in incidence of complications across all ages.

Conclusions

This exploratory secondary analysis of the DanGer Shock trial demonstrates that older patients with STEMI-related CS experience high mortality and may not attain the same benefit from routine treatment with an mAFP as younger patients. Incorporating age as a factor in patient selection may enhance the overall benefit of this therapy. (Danish Cardiogenic Shock Trial [DanShock]; NCT01633502).

### Systolic blood pressure and microaxial flow pump-associated survival in infarct-related cardiogenic shock: a post hoc analysis of the danGer shock randomized clinical trial [^5c40dace]. JAMA Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Microaxial flow pump treatment improves survival in selected patients with infarct-related cardiogenic shock; however, treatment carries substantial risks, and benefit may vary by patient subgroup. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) has been proposed as a modifier of the survival benefit.

Objective

To investigate whether SBP at randomization modifies the survival benefit of microaxial flow pump treatment in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction-related cardiogenic shock.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This was a post hoc analysis of the Danish-German (DanGer) Shock open-label randomized clinical trial among adult patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction complicated by cardiogenic shock, conducted between 2013 and 2023 at 14 tertiary invasive cardiac centers in Denmark, Germany, and the United Kingdom. Data analysis was performed from January 7 to April 7, 2024.

Intervention

Microaxial flow pump therapy plus standard care vs standard care alone.

Main Outcomes and Measures

All-cause mortality at 180 days according to randomization SBP.

Results

Of 355 patients included in the DanGer Shock trial, 351 patients had available SBP at randomization (median [IQR] age, 69 [59–76] years; 277 [79%] male). In a dichotomized regression analysis, microaxial flow pump treatment significantly reduced mortality for SBPs lower than 82 mm Hg compared with standard care alone (odds ratio [OR], 0.34; 95% CI, 0.18–0.63; P < .001). This was not evident for higher pressures (OR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.53–1.70; P = 0.90; P for interaction = .02). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and spline regression analysis supported these findings (P for interaction = .02; P for nonlinearity = .01).

Conclusions and Relevance

Randomization SBP was associated with the survival benefit of microaxial flow pump treatment, with the most hypotensive patients deriving the largest survival benefit. Early SBP may help identify patients most likely to gain a net benefit from microaxial flow pump treatment. Findings are hypothesis generating.

### Systolic blood pressure and microaxial flow pump-associated survival in infarct-related cardiogenic shock: a post hoc analysis of the danGer shock randomized clinical trial [^6d919a27]. JAMA Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Methods

Study Design

This is an exploratory, post hoc analysis of the DanGer Shock trial, a multicenter, randomized, open-label clinical trial conducted at 14 tertiary invasive cardiac centers in Denmark, Germany, and the United Kingdom investigating the survival benefit of transvalvular microaxial flow pump treatment in patients with STEMI-CS. The DanGer Shock trial design has been published elsewhere. In brief, eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive treatment with a microaxial flow pump (Impella CP; Abiomed/Johnson & Johnson MedTech) plus standard guideline-directed therapy vs standard guideline-directed therapy alone. In accordance with applicable legislation, informed consent was obtained as soon as possible in a stepwise manner — first via proxy (next of kin or independent physician), then directly from the patient when possible. The trial protocol was approved by the ethics committees of all participating sites and has been published elsewhere. Data analysis was performed from January 7 to April 7, 2024.

Study Population

The study included patients aged 18 years or older who presented with STEMI and CS. CS was defined as hypotension (SBP < 100 mm Hg or need for vasopressors), hypoperfusion (lactate level > 22.52 mg/dL [to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.111]), and left ventricular dysfunction (left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] < 45%). Patients resuscitated from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with a persistent Glasgow Coma Scale score less than 8, noncardiogenic shock, significant aortic valve stenosis or regurgitation, mechanical complications of the myocardial infarction, or right ventricular failure were excluded from trial participation. The full inclusion and exclusion criteria have been published previously. Only patients with recorded SBP at randomization were included in the present analysis.

Association of AKI With Mortality

The occurrence of either AKI or AKI with RRT during the study period of 180 days was associated with higher 180-day mortality in both study arms (Table 2).

Table 2.
Primary Outcomes Based on Occurrence of AKI and RRT

There was no significant interaction between the effect of allocation to the mAFP on all-cause mortality and the occurrence of AKI or the requirement for RRT with respect to 180-day mortality. In patients without AKI, the OR for 180-day mortality when allocated to the mAFP compared with standard care was 0.49 (95% CI, 0.26–0.93); in patients with AKI, the OR was 0.55 (95% CI, 0.29–0.98; P interaction = 0.84). In patients who did not receive RRT, the OR was 0.56 (95% CI, 0.33–0.95), compared with an OR of 0.44 (95% CI, 0.20–0.97) in those who received RRT (P interaction = 0.61).

Long-Term Kidney Outcomes

Serum creatinine level before discharge among survivors was higher in the mAFP group (median, 127 µmol/L [1.33 mg/dL; interquartile range, 91–244] in the mAFP group versus 100 µmol/L [1.13 mg/dL; interquartile range, 76.5–148] in the standard care group; P < 0.001). Time from symptom onset to randomization did not correlate with baseline creatinine levels (r = 0.072, P = 0.20; data not shown). At 180 days, none of the survivors (n = 73 in the standard group, n = 97 in the mAFP group) required RRT.

### Microaxial flow pump hemodynamic and metabolic effects in infarct-related cardiogenic shock: a substudy of the danGer shock randomized clinical trial [^2e79feaa]. JAMA Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Mechanical circulatory support with a microaxial flow pump (MAFP) has been shown to improve survival in ST-elevation myocardial infarction-induced cardiogenic shock (STEMI-CS). Understanding the impact on hemodynamic stability over time is crucial for optimizing patient treatment.

Objective

To determine if an MAFP reduces the need for pharmacological circulatory support without compromising hemodynamics compared with standard care in STEMI-CS.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This was a substudy of the Danish-German (DanGer) Shock trial, an international, multicenter, open-label randomized clinical trial. Patients from 14 heart centers across Denmark, Germany, and the UK were enrolled. Inclusion criteria for the trial were STEMI and systolic blood pressure less than 100 mm Hg or ongoing vasopressor treatment, left ventricular ejection fraction less than 45%, and arterial lactate level greater than 2.5 mmol/L. Of the enrolled patients, after exclusions from death in the catheterization laboratory or immediately on intensive care unit (ICU) admission, the remaining patients had serial recordings of hemodynamics, arterial lactate, and use of vasoactive drugs. Patients who were in comas after cardiac arrest and patients with mechanical complications or right ventricular failure were excluded. Data were analyzed from May to September 2024.

Interventions

MAFP and standard of care or standard of care alone.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Hemodynamic status in terms of heart rate and blood pressure, metabolic status in terms of arterial lactate concentration, and vasoactive-inotropic score (VIS). The clinical events during the first 72 hours were as follows: death from all causes, escalation of mechanical circulatory support, and discharge alive from the ICU.

Results

From 355 enrolled patients, 324 (mean [IQR] age, 68 [58–75] years; 259 male [80%]) underwent ICU treatment (169 [52%] in the MAFP group, 155 [48%] in the standard-care group). Baseline characteristics were balanced. There was no difference in heart rate between groups, and mean arterial pressure was above the treatment target of 65 mm Hg in both groups but was achieved with a lower VIS in the MAFP group. No difference in arterial lactate level was found between groups at randomization, but on arrival to the ICU, the MAFP group had significantly lower arterial lactate levels compared with the standard-care group (mean difference, 1.3 mmol/L; 95% CI, 0.7–1.9 mmol/L), a difference that persisted throughout the first 24 hours of observation. The MAFP group achieved lactate normalization (< 2 mmol/L) 12 hours (95% CI, 5–18 hours) before the standard-care group.

Conclusions and Relevance

Use of a MAFP reduces the use of vasopressors and inotropic medication while maintaining hemodynamic stability and achieving faster normalization of lactate level in patients with STEMI-CS.

### Microaxial flow pump or standard care in infarct-related cardiogenic shock [^346895a3]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

Background

The effects of temporary mechanical circulatory support with a microaxial flow pump on mortality among patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) complicated by cardiogenic shock remains unclear.

Methods

In an international, multicenter, randomized trial, we assigned patients with STEMI and cardiogenic shock to receive a microaxial flow pump (Impella CP) plus standard care or standard care alone. The primary end point was death from any cause at 180 days. A composite safety end point was severe bleeding, limb ischemia, hemolysis, device failure, or worsening aortic regurgitation.

Results

A total of 360 patients underwent randomization, of whom 355 were included in the final analysis (179 in the microaxial-flow-pump group and 176 in the standard-care group). The median age of the patients was 67 years, and 79.2% were men. Death from any cause occurred in 82 of 179 patients (45.8%) in the microaxial-flow-pump group and in 103 of 176 patients (58.5%) in the standard-care group (hazard ratio, 0.74; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.55 to 0.99; P = 0.04). A composite safety end-point event occurred in 43 patients (24.0%) in the microaxial-flow-pump group and in 11 (6.2%) in the standard-care group (relative risk, 4.74; 95% CI, 2.36 to 9.55). Renal-replacement therapy was administered to 75 patients (41.9%) in the microaxial-flow-pump group and to 47 patients (26.7%) in the standard-care group (relative risk, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.27 to 3.09).

Conclusions

The routine use of a microaxial flow pump with standard care in the treatment of patients with STEMI-related cardiogenic shock led to a lower risk of death from any cause at 180 days than standard care alone. The incidence of a composite of adverse events was higher with the use of the microaxial flow pump.

### Applying danGer shock eligibility criteria to a real-world cohort of cardiogenic shock patients [^5c9428a1]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The DanGer Shock trial investigated the effects of adding a microaxial flow pump to guideline-recommended therapy in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)-related cardiogenic shock (CS), finding a lower all-cause mortality at 180 days in the intervention group.

Methods

DanGer Shock eligibility criteria were applied to the prospective single-center PREPARE CardShock registry, which consecutively enrolled 721 patients between April 2019 and August 2024 with advanced CS-classified as stages C to E according to the SCAI shock classification-who were on vasoactive medication and underwent cardiac catheterization.

Results

Among 721 patients in the registry, 384 (53.3%) had STEMI-related CS. Of those, 117 (30.5%) met DanGer Shock trial eligibility criteria, accounting for 16.2% of the registry cohort. Median age of the eligible patients was 68 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 58–78), and 62.4% were male, compared to 68 years (IQR: 60–76) and 79.2% in DanGer Shock. PREPRARE-CS DanGer Shock eligible patients had a higher median systolic blood pressure (SBP) (92 mmHG [78–107] vs. 83 mmHG, [72–91]) and higher median lactate levels (5.2mmol/L [3.6–7.6] vs. 4.6mmol/L [3.3–7.0]) at baseline, and were more frequently resuscitated (56.4% vs. 20.3%). Device use was 42.7% in eligible patients. Renal replacement therapy (RRT) was more frequent among trial participants (34.4% vs. 17.1%). The 180-day mortality rate among eligible patients was 71.8%, compared to 52.1% in trial participants.

Conclusions

Among STEMI-related CS patients in our cohort, only one-third met the DanGer Shock eligibility criteria. Consequently, trial outcomes may not be broadly applicable.

Predictors of AKI and RRT

Even though the trial design of DanGer Shock does not allow for causal inference regarding the pathophysiologic mechanisms leading to higher rates of RRT and AKI in patients with CS treated with mAFP, we identified several factors at admission as well as throughout hospitalization that were tightly associated with these renal end points.

Previous studies hint toward low admission eGFR as a predictor of AKI risk in CS. This was also the case in our study, but to a lesser extent in the mAFP group as compared with the standard group. The AKI risk attributable to mAFP seemed to decrease with lower admission eGFR, even though patients with low eGFR were at higher a priori risk of AKI and RRT. The underlying reasons remain uncertain.

Sex differences represent a mostly unmet challenge in CS research, and DanGer Shock is no exception, given the high proportion of male participants and the uncertainty of benefit from the primary study intervention in women. With respect to renal outcomes in this trial, sex was no clear predictor of AKI risk, in line with previous observational studies reporting similar rates of RRT use in male and female patients with CS.

Beyond baseline factors, we identified several postadmission predictors of AKI and RRT in patients with and without mAFP. Of these, in both arms, bleeding events, low left ventricular ejection fraction, escalation to venoarterial ECMO, and positive fluid balance at 24 hours were highly relevant predictors of AKI. In the mAFP arm, hemolysis, suction events, higher pump speed, and longer duration of support were also associated with higher AKI risk.

Bleeding Events

In the context of the aforementioned other large randomized controlled trials, bleeding events should in general be expected as more common in ECLS-treated patients compared with mAFP-treated patients. Still, in ECLS-SHOCK, rates of AKI were lower in the ECLS arm. Thus, despite being associated with higher AKI risk, bleeding events alone are unlikely to solely explain the mAFP-specific excess risk of AKI and RRT observed in DanGer Shock. This, and the strong association between device-related measures and AKI risk, indicate other, more mAFP-specific risk factors.

### Coronary artery revascularization in the older adult population: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^85accee1]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

St-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) with cardiogenic shock in older adults — prevalence and device considerations: In a European cohort, cardiogenic shock in STEMI was more common in patients ≥ 75 years, with prevalence > 2-fold higher (10.8% versus 3.9%; P < 0.0001), and early revascularization remains the standard of care. Mechanical circulatory support with microaxial flow pumps may stabilize hemodynamics, but a secondary analysis reported that mortality benefit was limited to patients < 77 years, and among those ≥ 77 years microaxial pumps were associated with a greater number of deaths compared with standard care, with the subgroup analysis underpowered for definitive conclusions.

### Systolic blood pressure and microaxial flow pump-associated survival in infarct-related cardiogenic shock: a post hoc analysis of the danGer shock randomized clinical trial [^8f25dc0e]. JAMA Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

In this post hoc analysis of the DanGer Shock trial, we found low SBP at randomization to be an independent predictor of 180-day all-cause mortality in patients with STEMI-CS. Second, randomization SBP significantly modified the survival benefit of microaxial flow pump therapy, with benefit most pronounced in the most hypotensive patients. Adverse treatment events, however, appeared to occur independently of randomization SBP. Our findings underscore that microaxial flow pump therapy can improve survival in subgroups of patients with AMI-CS, but careful patient selection remains essential due to the complex risk-benefit profile of this treatment. The randomization SBP may be considered, alongside age, in patient-centered decision-making for this device therapy.

In AMI-CS, hypotension due to acute left ventricular failure and a decrease in cardiac output is initially maintained via a compensatory increase in peripheral vascular resistance. However, as left ventricular dysfunction progresses, blood pressure ultimately declines. SBP remains a readily obtainable clinical parameter and key component in various risk prediction scores for AMI and CS. Several studies have suggested low SBP as an independent predictor of mortality in AMI-CS. Conflicting evidence does exist, however. Blood pressure is not a static factor, and variations in timing of measurement, degree of vasopressor support, and particularly the immediate response to vasopressor treatment are important confounding factors that may explain the observed discrepancies. These factors are likely pivotal to both prognostic impact and clinical application. Notably, the SBPs in the present analysis were unlikely to be naive. We lack detailed information on vasoactive drug administration during catheterization laboratory stay, where the majority of patients were randomized. Here, vasoactive drugs are often given as bolus injections. Standard clinical practice in Denmark, Germany, and the United Kingdom dictates immediate initiation of vasopressor therapy in patients with profound hypotension due to AMI-CS. Thus, our SBPs likely reflect varying degrees of vasopressor-treated hypotension, including treatment-refractory cases, and should be interpreted accordingly.

Predictors of AKI in Patients of Both Study Arms

Low baseline eGFR was a predictor for AKI in the standard of care group (Table 3) and for RRT in the mAFP group. mAFP-associated excess risk of AKI decreased with lower admission eGFR (Figure 4). Sensitivity analyses using restricted cubic splines suggested linear association between baseline eGFR and AKI risk in both treatment arms.

B, Risk of AKI in microaxial flow pump (mAFP)–treated patients compared with standard across the range of admission eGFR estimated using a logistic regression model with mAFP and eGFR as predictors with an interaction term. The distribution of eGFR is depicted with density plots below each panel.

Baseline left ventricular ejection fraction was inversely associated with the risk of AKI (Table 3). Patients presenting with more severe SCAI stages (D/E versus C) and higher lactate levels also tended to have higher AKI risk (Table 3).

Postadmission predictors of AKI/RRT in both groups were Bleeding Academic Research Consortium 3 through 5 bleeding, a positive fluid balance at 24 hours after admission to the intensive care unit, and escalation to ECMO (Table 3 ;). In the mAFP group, we also identified device-related suction events, higher mAFP performance levels, and longer duration of mAFP support. In addition, among patients in whom bilirubin or plasma free hemoglobin levels were recorded (218 of 355 for bilirubin, 101 of 355 for plasma free hemoglobin), bilirubin levels at day 1 and highest plasma free hemoglobin at day 1 to 3 were also associated with AKI or RRT (Table 3 ;).

Acute myocardial infarction–cardiogenic shock (AMI-CS) randomized evidence and guidance — an RCT "of 600 patients with AMI-CS… demonstrated no effect on 30-day all-cause mortality and at 6-year long-term follow-up." The ECLS-SHOCK trial was "a multicenter, randomized, open-label trial of 420 patients with AMI-CS… which showed that the 30-day all-cause mortality was not lower" with early extracorporeal life support versus usual care. The DanGer Shock trial "demonstrated that early use of a microaxial flow pump… randomized within 24 hours… improved 180-day survival… noting an absolute mortality reduction of 12.7%," though "The rigorous entry criteria… limit the evidence-base… to a narrow cohort of patients with STEMI-CS." An individual patient data meta-analysis "with 6-month follow-up suggested that patients with STEMI-CS… had a reduction in mortality after tMCS use, inclusive of… VA-ECMO." Consistent with these data, the writing group states escalation "may be considered" for selected patients, and the figure footnote cautions that "the results were neutral" and "Routine use of these devices has not shown mortality benefit in RCTs."

Primary Outcomes

For this prespecified, secondary analysis of DanGer Shock, the incidence of AKI according to RIFLE criteria (Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, and End-stage kidney disease)and rates of RRT use throughout hospitalization were the main outcomes of interest. Both items were part of the study intake forms and adjudicated by clinical coordinators of the study at each respective site. AKI according to RIFLE criteria is defined as a ≥ 2-fold increase in serum creatinine or loss of glomerular filtration rate by ≥ 50% or a urine output of < 0.5 mL·kg·h over 12 hours. As part of the electronic case report forms, duration of RRT was recorded as < 30 days, 31 to 90 days, or > 90 days according to the original RIFLE classificationand the initiation of RRT was recorded with date and time after admission. For the purpose of this analysis, AKI status was assessed as no AKI, AKI without RRT, or AKI with RRT. AKI was recorded by the study sites and an independent contract research organization performed monitoring on all patients to ensure accuracy of recorded AKI class and use of RRT.

It was recommended in the study protocol to initiate RRT in case of oliguria (total diuresis of < 50 mL in 6 hours) with volume overload (pulmonary edema), renal insufficiency with serum creatinine > 300 to 400 mmol/L, treatment-resistant metabolic acidosis (arterial pH < 7.30), or severe hyperkalemia (serum potassium > 6.5 mmol/L). The final decision to initiate RRT was at the discretion of the treating shock team.

In addition, to characterize the relevance of AKI and RRT for the primary and secondary end points of the DanGer trial, we performed separate analyses treating 180-day mortality and escalation of treatment to additional mechanical circulatory support (short- or long-term), heart transplantation, or death of any cause as outcomes, and the occurrence of AKI and initiation of RRT as predictors, respectively.

Limitations

DanGer Shock was a pragmatic trial, and the data captured were based on data collected for the main trial; therefore, the granularity of information on renal characteristics could have been higher, and the data collected were based on knowledge at the time of study initiation > 10 years ago. For example, hemolysis likely played an important role in the development of AKI in mAFP-supported patients, but some markers of hemolysis, such as fibrinogen, were not assessed, and the measurements of plasma free hemoglobin, haptoglobin, or bilirubin were not mandated by the study protocol and were recorded only if measured. Thus, the association between these markers and AKI could be influenced by selection bias.

Furthermore, only the history of previous chronic kidney disease was available, not whether these patients required dialysis before the study. However, the overall number of patients with a history of chronic kidney disease was low (10%), and no survivors required dialysis at 6 months, suggesting that the proportion of patients requiring dialysis at baseline was low and would be expected to be evenly distributed between treatment groups given the randomized design.

Serum creatinine was not assessed at 180 days, but only the latest available serum creatinine before discharge, which limits possible inference on the long-term renal outcomes. Contrast volume used during the initial procedure in the catheterization laboratory was not assessed in the study, but there were no differences in the extent of revascularization between groups. Hemodynamic data obtained from pulmonary artery catheters were not available for this study.

The initiation of RRT remained subject to the bedside clinician's decision, who was not blinded to treatment allocation as blinding was not possible in this trial. Bearing this in mind, RRT use in this study should reflect real-life clinical practice. Another advantage of this analysis is that AKI (independent of RRT) was also assessed as part of the electronic case report forms, and this outcome is less likely to be affected by treatment bias than RRT.

Whereas the randomized controlled trial setting may allow for causal inference with respect to mAFP-associated AKI and risk of RRT, the analyses of predictors of AKI and RRT may be subject to residual confounding and require further testing in clinical trials with the appropriate study design.

### Microaxial flow pump use and renal outcomes in infarct-related cardiogenic shock: a secondary analysis of the danGer shock trial [^cbfee949]. Circulation (2024). Medium credibility.

Low Output and Severe CS

In this secondary analysis, we identified that in both groups, several measures indicative of low cardiac output were associated with higher risk of AKI and RRT. As such, admission left ventricular ejection fraction was inversely related to AKI risk. We also found that higher admission heart rate tended to be associated with AKI risk. Even though higher heart rate in general could indicate volume demand, specifically in CS it is more likely to represent a signal of reduced stroke volume and compensatory tachycardia to maintain cardiac output, and thus again a measure of disease severity. Increased heart rate may also be a surrogate of minor bleeding events or a systemic inflammatory response. The fact that we identified positive fluid balance 24 hours after admission as being associated with a higher AKI risk again may also point against heart rate as a surrogate for volume demand. Yet positive fluid balance may be evident in different clinical scenarios, such as no diuretic treatment or a lack of response to a diuretic stress test, which makes this measure difficult to interpret without further information. In addition, escalation to ECMO could simply be interpreted as another surrogate for more severe CS cases with low output, and was associated with a higher risk of RRT in the entire study population.

### Randomized trials of percutaneous microaxial flow pump devices: JACC state-of-the-art review [^ef724755]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

The use of mechanical circulatory support devices in cardiovascular practice has risen exponentially over the past decade. These devices are currently used for hemodynamic support in patients with cardiogenic shock, high-risk percutaneous coronary intervention, left ventricular unloading, protection of kidneys, and right ventricular failure. The Impella (Abiomed) percutaneous microaxial flow pump devices are rapidly gaining popularity. However, despite their increasing use, there are limited randomized clinical trials (RCTs) to support the benefits of the therapy and growing concern regarding complication rates. Vascular problems, including bleeding and acute limb ischemia, are associated with the devices, but published reports also highlight risks for cardiac perforations, mitral chordae rupture, and stroke. In this review, we summarize the history, mechanism of action, previously published RCT data, and upcoming RCTs on these devices.

Hemolysis

Hemolysis can cause direct renal damage through the release of free hemoglobin and development of pigment nephropathy. The DanGer Shock protocol mandated 48 hours of mAFP support at the highest possible P level while avoiding suction. This may have led to overly aggressive unloading in some individuals and concurrently may have increased the risk of hemolysis. This assumption is supported by the current association between high performance levels and higher levels of bilirubin at 24 hours. Hemolysis may also be the major driver of the strong association between suction events and AKI risk that was evident in the current study. This high risk of AKI in patients with suction events calls for strict surveillance for early indicators of imminent suction events, such as changes in motor current signal, and should prompt immediate imaging study to evaluate device placement, right ventricular function, volume status, and (until resolved) lowering of the P level on the device.

In addition, redesigning an mAFP to minimize suction forces and improve hemocompatibility could potentially reduce hemolysis. Direct reduction of plasma free hemoglobin (eg, by haptoglobin infusion) may be another promising, albeit purely experimental, approach. Implementation of these strategies could potentially improve renal outcomes and overall prognosis in patients with STEMI-CS requiring mAFP support.

If prolonged support is required, an axillary approach has been proposed for more stable device placement. Yet, recent data from observational studies of higher-volume mAFPs, such as the Impella 5.0 or 5.5, suggest that the RRT rate may be similar to that of the Impella CP at 41.3% in acute myocardial infarction–related CS. Therefore, it remains unclear whether an axillary approach could lower incidence of hemolysis and AKI, and this question cannot be answered by the current trial, the results of which should be interpreted only for the device tested (Impella CP).

### Breaking down cardiogenic shock: an analytical reflection on the danGer-SHOCK and ECLS-SHOCK trials [^3e33c6b8]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Mechanical circulatory support devices, particularly the microaxial flow pump (mAFP), have gained traction in managing cardiogenic shock in patients with acute myocardial infarction. However, trials like DanGer-SHOCK (Microaxial Flow Pump or Standard Care in Infarct-Related Cardiogenic Shock) and ECLS-SHOCK (Extracorporeal Life Support in Infarct Related Cardiogenic Shock) have reported differing outcomes, making it challenging to draw definitive conclusions. To explore this further, we conducted a comparative analysis of the 30-day and 6-month mortality rates from the DanGer-SHOCK and ECLS-SHOCK trials, examining differences in patient populations and risk profiles. The goal was to determine whether these differences could explain the conflicting outcomes or if the benefits observed in the DanGer-SHOCK trial were directly attributable to the mAFP strategy. One key finding is that, despite similar control group mortality rates, the intervention group in DanGer-SHOCK demonstrated a notably lower mortality rate at both 30 days and 6 months compared with the ECLS trial, with an absolute difference of approximately 8%. This benefit is not due to inherent risk differences but is instead attributed to the Impella-based strategy. Compared with standard care, mAFP data revealed a 7% mortality reduction at 30 days, which grew to 12.7% at 180 days, highlighting the long-term effectiveness of the mAFP strategy in maintaining hemodynamic stability and improving survival. These results suggest that, in cardiogenic shock management, the DanGer unloading strategy, when combined with percutaneous coronary intervention, plays a significant role in improving long-term survival through early intervention and ventricular unloading, independent of control group factors. Further research is needed to confirm the broader applicability of this approach in different patient populations.

Randomized trials are challenging; although small studies of microaxial flow pumps did not show clinical benefit in AMI and cardiogenic shock, a randomized trial at specialized European centers demonstrated a mortality benefit with increased risk of complications including limb ischemia and renal replacement therapy. Best practices for insertion, including multimodality fluoroscopy and ultrasound, should be utilized when feasible for femoral access.

### Microaxial mechanical circulatory support in cardiogenic shock: ready for prime time? [^d3f277bb]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Randomised controlled studies on the use of intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation and veno-arterial extracorporeal life support have failed to offer a survival benefit compared with standard therapy in patients with myocardial infarction-associated cardiogenic shock. Thus, the results of a recent study using microaxial mechanical circulatory support showing a survival benefit in the intention-to-treat analysis will likely immediately enter treatment guidelines. We express the need for some caution regarding an even broader clinical implementation of these devices by pointing out the statistical fragility of existing data and the contrasting results of numerous large observational studies which almost all demonstrate a higher mortality of using microaxial pumps or extracorporeal life support instead of intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation. Additionally, we discuss confounding bias in recent publications on microaxial mechanical circulatory support.

### Rationale and design of danGer shock: Danish-German cardiogenic shock trial [^373c14fa]. American Heart Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

The DanGer Shock trial test the hypothesis that left ventricular (LV) mechanical circulatory support with Impella CP transvalvular microaxial flow pump improves survival in patients with ST segment elevation acute myocardial infarction complicated by cardiogenic shock (AMICS) compared to conventional guideline-driven treatment. This paper describes the rationale and design of the randomized trial, in addition to the baseline characteristics of the population screened and enrolled so far.

Methods

The DanGer Shock study is a prospective, multicenter, open-label trial in patients with AMICS randomized 1:1 to Impella CP or current guideline-driven therapy with planned enrollment of 360 patients. Patients comatose after out of hospital cardiac arrest are excluded. Eligible patients are randomized immediately following shock diagnosis. Among patients randomized to receive Impella CP, the device is placed prior to angioplasty. The primary endpoint is all-cause mortality at 180 days. Baseline characteristics of patients screened and randomized in the DanGer Shock as of June 2018 are compared with 2 contemporary AMICS studies.

Results

As of end of June 2018, 314 patients were screened and 100 patients were randomized. Patients had median arterial lactate of 5.5 mmol/L (interquartile range 3.7–8.8 mmol/L), median systolic blood pressure of 76 mmHg (interquartile range 70–88 mmHg), and median LV ejection fraction of 20% (interquartile range 10%-30%).

Conclusion

The DanGer Shock trial will be the first adequately powered randomized trial to address whether mechanical circulatory LV support with Impella CP can improve survival in AMICS. Baseline characteristics of the first 100 randomized patients indicate a population in profound cardiogenic shock.

### Scrutinizing mechanical circulatory support in cardiogenic shock: have we jumped the gun? [^6fce2805]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Despite increasing therapeutic options and disposable resources, cardiogenic shock (CS) remains a formidable condition with high mortality. Today, veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and microaxial flow devices (Impella, Abiomed, Danvers, USA) are established forms of mechanical circulatory support (MCS) in CS, with increasing application over the years. Despite this trend, incorporation into current ESC (Class IIa, evidence C) and AHA/ACC (Class IIa, evidence B-NR) guidelines is based nearly exclusively on observational results. Despite these recommendations and increasing application, current evidence from randomized controlled trials has not provided clear mortality benefit. Thus, reflection on current evidence is hereby justified.

Background

The main objective of the Danish German Cardiogenic Shock trial (DanGer Shock ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01633502) is to assess the efficacy of the trans valvular axial flow device Impella CP in treating patients with AMICS shock due to STEMI undergoing emergency percutaneous coronary intervention.

Methods

This statistical analysis plan represents an overview of the statistical methods which will be used for analyzing the DanGer Shock trial.

Results

The primary study endpoint is death from all causes through 180 days in the intention to treat population (all randomized consented patients). The secondary endpoints comprise; composite event of the need for additional mechanical support, need for cardiac transplantation, and death of all causes whichever comes first; and days alive and out of hospital. As exploratory analyses an as treated analysis of primary endpoint will be performed. Composite safety endpoint will comprise of major bleeding, vascular complications, device malfunction, damage to the aortic valve, and significant hemolysis. The primary endpoint death rate at 180 days will be analyzed using Cox proportional hazards analysis. The result will be reported as hazard ratio and corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI). No imputation of missing values will be performed. Additional statistical analyses for predefined hemodynamic, metabolic, renal, hematological, and health economics substudies will be specified in separate protocols.

Conclusion

Main analyses of the primary and secondary outcomes of the DanGer Shock trial will be conducted according to this publication.

Mechanical circulatory support (MCS) in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) and cardiogenic shock — recommendations are as follows: For selected patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and severe or refractory cardiogenic shock, insertion of a microaxial intravascular flow pump "is reasonable to reduce death" (Class 2a, Level B-R). In patients with mechanical complication of ACS, short-term MCS devices "are reasonable for hemodynamic stabilization as a bridge to surgery" (Class 2a, Level B-NR). In patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and cardiogenic shock, the routine use of intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) or venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) "is not recommended due to a lack of survival benefit" (Class 3: No benefit, Level B-R).

### A novel transaortic pulsatile pump to unload the left ventricle [^12b1ce1e]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2025). Medium credibility.

Temporary mechanical circulatory support (tMCS) systems have evolved over the past 40 years to match growing clinical needs of patients with advanced heart failure (HF) and cardiogenic shock. Contemporary tMCS devices include the pulsatile intra-aortic balloon pump; high-speed, continuous flow, rotor-based, microaxial flow pumps; and centrifugal flow pumps (TandemHeart, CentriMag; venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation). Despite significant evolution in tMCS design, many studies have failed to demonstrate significant benefits of these devices in patients with cardiogenic shock, and multiple observational studies have suggested harm with routine use of Impella CP in cardiogenic shock. Similarly, routine use of intra-aortic balloon pump and venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in cardiogenic shock have also failed to show significant mortality benefit.

However, in 2024, the DanGer Shock (Danish-German Cardiogenic Shock) Trial demonstrated that routine implantation of Impella CP in addition to standard care alone is superior to standard care alone in reducing 6-month mortality among patients presenting with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction and cardiogenic shock (45.8% vs 58.5%, HR: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.55–0.99; P = 0.04) in the intention to treat analysis. Importantly, the mortality benefit in the "as treated" analysis was not significant, and those patients randomized to Impella CP therapy had a higher risk of complications, eg, renal replacement therapy, sepsis, and limb ischemia. These results suggest that despite the hemodynamic benefit of continuous flow devices, there are often serious complications of high rotor speeds and transvalvular placement, including hemolysis, bleeding, arrhythmias, and in some cases death, that reduce their overall net benefit.

Potential therapeutic implications of CS subphenotyping

Clinical, physiologic, and molecular subphenotyping provides a new way to classify CS patients. This may not only allow pathway and prognostic enrichment but also support future clinical trials of personalized interventions in CS patients who are prospectively included based on a specific subphenotype. The recent DanGer Shock trial assessing microaxial flow pump (Impella CP) plus standard care vs. standard care alone, emphasizes the benefit of targeting therapies to specific clinical subclasses of CS patients (ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction with a low risk of hypoxic brain injury). The multicenter DAMIS clinical trial including 141 patients with shock, most of them from a cardiac origin, showed that real-time sublingual microcirculation monitoring significantly influenced treatment changes (fluids, vasopressors) but did not result in improved microcirculation, nor in decreasing 30-day mortality. In the future, microcirculatory vasodilators could be evaluated in CS patients with optimized macrohemodynamics and a microcirculatory dysfunction subphenotype. The ACCOST-HH trial evaluated adrecizumab (a non-neutralizing antibody) targeting adrenomedullin pathways (an active circulating marker involved in endothelial function). Although the primary endpoint was not achieved, adrecizumab was well tolerated and demonstrated biologic activity. Enhanced molecular subphenotyping incorporating additional actionable circulating markers from different pathophysiological domains may improve identification of CS patients likely to benefit from targeted therapies (e.g. inflammation, endothelial modulation). The Shock and acute Conditions OutcOmes Platform (ShockCO-OP) is an example of a research program with physiologic and molecular trait mapping of CS patients supporting feasibility (NCT06376318,) to allow precision medicine in this population.

### SCAI expert consensus statement on out of hospital cardiac arrest [^8a049283]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2020). High credibility.

Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) with shock — mechanical circulatory support (MCS) and extracorporeal life support (ECLS): There are no large randomized trials to date evaluating the use of MCS devices among OHCA patients with shock. The DanGer Shock trial is being evaluated whereby 360 patients will be randomized to percutaneous transvalvular microaxial flow plus conventional therapy, while in IMPRESS, 48 patients, (92% with cardiac arrest prior to randomization) were randomly assigned to Impella CP versus intra-aortic balloon pump, and treatment with Impella CP did not reduce mortality compared to IABP at 30 days. The use of MCS, specifically Impella, has rapidly been increasing among patients undergoing PCI with limited evidence of efficacy and possible increase in adverse events. For refractory OHCA, the role of extracorporeal life support (ECLS) is of research interest; single centers with the necessary resources and regimented protocols have demonstrated benefit, ongoing randomized trials aim to determine benefit in carefully selected OHCA patients, and whether this strategy is generalizable outside dedicated centers has not been demonstrated. Institutions need to implement appropriate pathways and transfer protocols to hospitals with adequate resources for deteriorating patients.

### Revolutionizing cardiogenic shock treatment: is the microaxial flow pump the ultimate game changer? [^9af45166]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

Acute myocardial infarction‐related cardiogenic shock (AMICS) is associated with persistent high early mortality rates ranging from 40% to 60%., Despite advancements in AMICS knowledge, few positive studies have impacted patient outcomes. Indeed, landmark trials such as SHOCKand CULPRIT‐SHOCKprovided valuable insights into cardiogenic shock (CS) management, but did not highlight the potential benefit of temporary mechanical circulatory support (tMCS).

Recently, four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating extracorporeal life support (ECLS) in CS have failed to demonstrate any benefits in terms of survival compared with optimal medical treatment., Thus, the consideration of tMCS in CS as a bridge‐to‐recovery/‐to‐decision/‐to‐bridge stays with a low level of recommendation (class IIC and IIaC, respectively, for the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation/Heart Failure Society of America and the European Society of Cardiology). In contrast, the recent DanGer Shock trialoffered for the first‐time robust evidence in favour of the percutaneous microaxial flow pump (MaFP) (Impella, Abiomed) in AMICS.

Here, we provide a summary of the two most extensive prospective randomized clinical trials in tMCS (ECLS‐SHOCKand DanGer Shock) aiming to comprehend the differences in their outcomes (Figure 1).

### Percutaneous transvalvular microaxial flow pump support in cardiology [^511e8c7f]. Circulation (2022). Medium credibility.

The Impella device (Impella, Abiomed, Danvers, MA) is a percutaneous transvalvular microaxial flow pump that is currently used for (1) cardiogenic shock, (2) left ventricular unloading (combination of venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and Impella concept), (3) high-risk percutaneous coronary interventions, (4) ablation of ventricular tachycardia, and (5) treatment of right ventricular failure. Impella-assisted forward blood flow increased mean arterial pressure and cardiac output, peripheral tissue perfusion, and coronary blood flow in observational studies and some randomized trials. However, because of the need for large-bore femoral access (14 F for the commonly used Impella CP device) and anticoagulation, the incidences of bleeding and ischemic complications are as much as 44% and 18%, respectively. Hemolysis is reported in as many as 32% of patients and stroke in as many as 13%. Despite the rapidly growing use of the Impella device, there are still insufficient data on its effect on outcome and complications on the basis of large, adequately powered randomized controlled trials. The only 2 small and also underpowered randomized controlled trials in cardiogenic shock comparing Impella versus intra-aortic balloon pump did not show improved mortality. Several larger randomized controlled trials are currently recruiting patients or are in preparation in cardiogenic shock (DanGer Shock [Danish-German Cardiogenic Shock Trial; NCT01633502]), left ventricular unloading (DTU-STEMI [Door-To-Unload in ST-Segment-Elevation Myocardial Infarction; NCT03947619], UNLOAD ECMO [Left Ventricular Unloading to Improve Outcome in Cardiogenic Shock Patients on VA-ECMO], and REVERSE [A Prospective Randomised Trial of Early LV Venting Using Impella CP for Recovery in Patients With Cardiogenic Shock Managed With VA ECMO; NCT03431467]) and high-risk percutaneous coronary intervention (PROTECT IV [Impella-Supported PCI in High-Risk Patients With Complex Coronary Artery Disease and Reduced Left Ventricular Function; NCT04763200]).

### Management of cardiogenic shock: state-of-the-art [^c20fa983]. Intensive Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

IABP has long deemed to provide some low degree of left-ventricular support by diastolic blood-pressure augmentation and afterload reduction, which, however, could not be confirmed in RCTs. Due to its ease of insertion, cost-effectiveness, and favorable adverse event profile, it has been widely used despite a lack of evidence. This electrocardiogram (ECG)-gated volume-displacement pump is percutaneously placed in the descending aorta, enhancing coronary perfusion during diastole, and reducing afterload during systole. In comparison to control, it was not able to significantly augment CO or any other hemodynamic variable in RCTs. Large-scale RCTs on IABP use in AMI-CS did not show survival benefits compared to medical therapy. Sufficient evidence for its benefit in other etiologies including acute or acute-on-chronic heart failure with CS and CS with mechanical complications post-AMI, possibly serving as a bridge-to-recovery or bridge-to-LVAD or heart transplantation, is not available.

The Impella family, with transvalvular axial flow pumps ranging from 3.5 to 5.5 L/min, has gained prominence in severe CS and LV-dysfunction. Newer devices like Impella 5.5 theoretically offer complete LV support, although RCTs demonstrating survival benefits in CS patients are lacking. Although overall evidence for Impella 5.5 is limited, its use grows along the advantages during longer support times and less access-site complications. Notably, two small RCTs, ISAR-SHOCK and IMPRESS-in-severe-shock, assessing Impella 2.5 and CP devices failed to show any survival benefit. Large-scale propensity matched studies encompassing more than 100,000 patients consistently showed no survival benefit or even higher mortality with consistent higher complication rates such as major bleeding and limb ischemia. However, recently, the results of the Danish Germany (DanGer) shock trial were published: in 360 highly selected patients with AMI-CS with anterior STEMI without high risk of hypoxic brain injury, comparing Impella® CP versus standard of care Impella support was associated with better 180-day outcome. Despite the long recruitment period, the narrow inclusion criteria, and several open questions like the highest ever reported increase in mortality from 30 days to 6 months in control patients, the shortest ICU time in the control arm, and the highest ever reported renal replacement therapy in the active tMCS arm, this RCT is an important study supporting the use of tMCS in selected patients.

### A framework for exception from informed consent in trials enrolling patients with ST-Segment-elevation myocardial infarction and cardiogenic shock [^ffbfd5bc]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Cardiogenic shock (CS) is a state of critical end‐organ hypoperfusion attributable to reduced cardiac output. Acute ST‐segment–elevation myocardial infarction (AMI) with concurrent CS (AMI‐CS) has high morbidity and mortality and requires rapid initiation of therapy to improve prognosis. Randomized trials in human subjects are generally recognized as the reference standard for evidence of the safety and efficacy of significant risk therapies. Despite multiple trials evaluating promising interventions in patients with CS enrolling patients outside the United States without prospective written consent (PWC), no trial enrolling patients with active CS has completed enrollment in the United States in the past 25 years. This is in large part because of perceived difficulties in obtaining informed consent, and concerns that processes related to obtaining consent would delay essential therapy. Such trials are important, as there are multiple novel devices and other promising interventions for CS that warrant formal evaluation. These include drugs intended to improve cardiac output or vasomotor tone, as well as temporary mechanical circulatory support (MCS) devices intended to support failing ventricles, and improve cardiac and systemic perfusion. When this framework was developed to facilitate conduct of randomized trials in patients with AMI‐CS in the United States, there was incomplete evidence of benefit on the optimal use of temporary MCS, using microaxial flow pumps (MFPs) (Impella, Johnson and Johnson MedTech Inc, Danvers, MA) or venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, in patients with CS. Moreover, such MCS devices carry potential for substantial risk, including bleeding, thrombosis, and vascular complications, and some prior trials of other interventions that were commonly used in high‐risk populations subsequently demonstrated increased risk of harm. Several recent observational studies and randomized trials of MCS have generated conflicting evidence about treatment for patients with AMI‐CS, highlighting the importance of facilitating contemporary CS trials in all countries where this evidence may inform care. Thus, inclusion of patients in the United States is highly desirable.

### Impact of baseline cardiogenic shock severity on outcomes in patients treated with impella device [^e63d46db]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Cardiogenic shock (CS) is a fatal condition that begins with impaired cardiac function, leading to systemic hypoperfusion and resulting in hemodynamic, neurohormonal, and metabolic changes that progressively worsen without treatment., Despite therapeutic advances in drug and mechanical circulatory support (MCS) devices over the past 2 decades, the short‐term mortality rate in patients with CS remains largely unchanged and high, ranging between 30% and 60%., In CS management, the treatment effect varies according to the mixed pathogeneses, phenotypes, and clinical presentations, and consistent parameters used to accurately assess shock severity were lacking. Recent publications have reported that the degree of hemodynamic and metabolic responsiveness to comprehensive therapies depends on the patient profile.

Impella (Abiomed, Danvers, MA), a percutaneous transvalvular microaxial flow pump, has recently emerged as a new device for temporary MCS in CS management, in addition to the intra‐aortic balloon pump and venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA‐ECMO). Overall, retrospective data on Impella use in CS compared with standard therapy are heterogeneous. However, the DanGer Shock (Danish–German Cardiogenic Shock) trial demonstrated that Impella use in addition to standard therapy reduced the risk of all‐cause death at 180 days compared with standard therapy alone among patients with CS complicated with ST‐segment–elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Furthermore, a previous large‐scale study using propensity score matching demonstrated that patients treated with a combination therapy of VA‐ECMO and Impella had significantly lower mortality rates than those treated with VA‐ECMO alone. The feasibility of using the Impella in CS is expected to increase in the coming years.

### Microaxial flow pump effects in infarct-related cardiogenic shock… [^e9aeaacb]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Question Does the use of a microaxial flow pump reduce the need for pharmacological circulatory support and what are the effects on hemodynamics and lactate clearance in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction–induced cardiogenic shock. Findings. In this substudy of the Danish-German Shock randomized clinical trial involving 324 patients with STEMI-CS admitted to the intensive care unit, the MAFP group had significantly lower vasoactive-inotropic scores during the first 12 hours compared with the standard-care group, without compromising hemodynamics. In addition, MAFP was associated with significantly faster arterial lactate clearance compared with standard of care. Meaning Results suggest that the use of MAFP reduced the need for pharmacological circulatory support while maintaining hemodynamic stability in patients with STEMI-CS.

Importance Mechanical circulatory support with a microaxial flow pump has been shown to improve survival in ST-elevation myocardial infarction–induced cardiogenic shock. Understanding the impact on hemodynamic stability over time is crucial for optimizing patient treatment. Objective To determine if an MAFP reduces the need for pharmacological circulatory support without compromising hemodynamics compared with standard care in STEMI-CS. Design, Setting, and Participants. This was a substudy of the Danish-German Shock trial, an international, multicenter, open-label randomized clinical trial. Patients from 14 heart centers across Denmark, Germany, and the UK were enrolled. Inclusion criteria for the trial were STEMI and systolic blood pressure less than 100 mm Hg or ongoing vasopressor treatment, left ventricular ejection fraction less than 45%, and arterial lactate level greater than 2. 5 mmol/L.

Results From 355 enrolled patients, 324 underwent ICU treatment. Baseline characteristics were balanced. The MAFP group achieved lactate normalization 12 hours before the standard-care group. Conclusions and Relevance Use of a MAFP reduces the use of vasopressors and inotropic medication while maintaining hemodynamic stability and achieving faster normalization of lactate level in patients with STEMI-CS.

### Early support in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction complicated by shock. design of exception from informed consent processes in recover IV trial [^2fc49af8]. American Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Cardiogenic shock (CS) is a state of critical end-organ hypoperfusion due to reduced cardiac output. Patients with acute myocardial infarction-related cardiogenic shock (AMI-CS) have a survival to discharge of only 50% to 60%. Mechanical circulatory support (MCS) devices are intended to support the failing heart and improve perfusion. Randomized controlled trials are required to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of MCS in AMI-CS, but patients with AMI-CS are often unable to provide informed consent for research. Multiple trials have enrolled patients with cardiac arrest using exception from informed consent (EFIC) for emergency research in the United States (U.S.) but none have enrolled patients with AMI-CS using the same mechanism. To address discordant estimates of the effectiveness of MCS in patients with AMI-CS, a multi-center randomized trial was initiated in the U.S. and Europe to assess the effectiveness of early use of microaxial flow pumps [MFP] (Impella, J + J Heart Recovery Inc, Danvers, MA). A central Institutional Review Board (CIRB) approved the protocol with a tiered consent process and EFIC procedures in anticipation that some patients or their legally authorized representative would be able to provide prospective consent while many would not. Standardized community consultation and public disclosure activities were developed and implemented centrally by an Emergency Care Core ECC) in collaboration with the steering committee, sponsor and candidate sites. We herein describe the EFIC process and methods that were used to implement an AMI-CS trial in the U.S.

### Mechanical circulatory support in cardiogenic shock: translating trial evidence into real-world practice [^fae5ef98]. Open Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

While iterative developments have improved outcomes of patients with myocardial infarction, mortality in patients with acute myocardial infarction cardiogenic shock (AMI-CS) remains stubbornly high. Several promising treatments have ultimately failed to pass the bar of randomised controlled trials. Twenty-five years have passed since the last trial evidence to improve outcomes, with early revascularisation showing significant reductions in 6-month mortality from 63% to 50% in the SHOCK Trial. Notable neutral studies in this period were IABP-SHOCK II and ECLS-SHOCK, in which randomisation to either the intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) failed to show incremental benefit over standard treatment. Current guidelines recommend against routine mechanical circulatory support in patients with AMI-CS.

The publication of the Danish-German Cardiogenic Shock Trial (DANGER-SHOCK) earlier this year was therefore greeted with great enthusiasm. The trial randomised patients with STEMI-related CS to either immediate mechanical circulatory support with an Impella CP or standard care. The primary endpoint of death from any cause occurred in 46% of patients in the Impella CP group and 59% of patients in the standard care group, with eight patients needing mechanical circulatory support to prevent one death. As widely acknowledged by the investigators, DANGER-SHOCK patients were highly selected to identify those likely to benefit from mechanical support; patients who were comatose following an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest or had severe right-ventricular failure were excluded. Enrolling the 360 patients required a 10-year recruitment period, indicating the degree of selection involved.

### Mechanical circulatory support for acute myocardial infarction cardiogenic shock: review and recent updates [^0cfcfbe0]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Cardiogenic shock (CS) in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is a life-threatening syndrome characterized by systemic hypoperfusion that can quickly progress to multiorgan failure and death. Various devices and configurations of mechanical circulatory support (MCS) exist to support patients, each with unique pathophysiological characteristics. The Intra-aortic balloon pump can improve coronary perfusion, decrease afterload, and indirectly augment cardiac output. TandemHeart, a percutaneous ventricular assist device, can decrease left ventricular preload and directly augment cardiac output. Neither the intra-aortic balloon pump nor the percutaneous ventricular assist device has been shown to decrease mortality in the revascularization era. Venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation can offer complete cardiopulmonary support; however, it has not been shown to decrease mortality. Recent studies have indicated that microaxial flow pumps, such as Abiomed's Impella family of devices, can decrease mortality in the AMI-CS population. Managing AMI-CS requires careful clinical assessment, as no single MCS device is universally effective, and device-related complications are common. While venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation provides complete support, it has not demonstrated a mortality benefit in major trials and carries significant risks. In contrast, microaxial flow pumps have shown a mortality benefit but with higher complication rates. Ongoing research and advancements aim to refine MCS strategies, improve device safety, and enhance patient outcomes.

### Contemporary trends in use of mechanical circulatory support in patients with acute MI and cardiogenic shock [^b18112ab]. Open Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cardiogenic shock remains a leading cause of death following acute myocardial infarction with sustained 30-day mortality of approximately 50% for nearly two decades. Use of mechanical circulatory support (MCS) is widely debated with no substantial evidence supporting its use in patients with acute myocardial infarction and cardiogenic shock (AMICS). To date, the Intra-aortic Balloon Pump (IABP)-SHOCK II trial is the only adequately powered randomised controlled trial assessing the use of MCS in AMICS, and the trial failed to show any prognostic benefit with the use of IABP. Contemporary studies on temporal trends in use of MCS in AMICS are limited but generally show a shift in choice of the device with a decrease in the use of IABP and an increase in the use of other devices, namely, venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) and transvalvular microaxial flow pumps. In a recent retrospective study, general use of Impella was not associated with improved survival compared with the IABP. However, the percutaneous assist devices pooled in the analyses have differing support capabilities and mode of action, and there is increasing evidence of a possible timing issue favouring early application of MCS. Therefore, we sought to investigate the use of MCS in AMICS and assessed the temporal trends in the choice of the device and the patient characteristics of those receiving MCS between 2010 and 2017. Further, we assessed the survival benefit of early application of IABP or Impella CP compared with a matched control group.

### Mechanical circulatory support in patients without cardiogenic shock undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention [^287cb205]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

The use of mechanical circulatory support (MCS)‐assisted percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has increased over the past decade. The intra‐aortic balloon pump (IABP) has historically been the most commonly used device; however, increased use of MCS‐assisted PCI has largely been driven by the increased use of other MCS types, such as intravascular microaxial left ventricular assist devices (LVADs). Until the recently published DanGer Shock trial which showed an improved mortality at 180‐days in those receiving intravascular LVADs, the preponderance of observational data comparing patients with cardiogenic shock supported by intravascular LVADs versus IABPs have either shown similar outcomes or potential harm in those receiving intravascular LVADs., Specifically for patients undergoing high‐risk PCI, some have suggested that the higher cardiac output provided by intravascular LVADs may lead to more complete revascularization. In patients without cardiogenic shock, the majority of available studies on MCS use are retrospective or lack a control group. To date, the largest randomized controlled trial comparing intravascular LVADs versus IABPs for PCI in patients without cardiogenic shock was stopped early due to futility.

Recent societal guidelines give a 2b recommendation for the use of MCS for selected high‐risk patientsbut give limited guidance on device type. Currently, the PROTECT IV (Impella‐Supported PCI in High‐Risk Patients With Complex Coronary Artery Disease and Reduced Left Ventricular Function) trial is enrolling an estimated 1252 participants comparing intravascular LVAD use with IABP use for high‐risk PCI (NCT04763200). However, the estimated completion date is not until 2027, and until these results are available, the available data provide little guidance to clinicians. Therefore, we analyzed a large, contemporary cohort of insured patients to assess associations between clinical outcomes, including mortality, and cost between intravascular LVAD versus IABP use in patients undergoing PCI without cardiogenic shock. In addition, we assessed differences between device type stratified by patients with and without acute myocardial infarction (AMI).

### Outcomes with impella CP in acute myocardial infarction vs heart failure cardiogenic shock: insights from the cardiogenic shock working group [^06bce484]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Impella CP (Abiomed, Danvers, MA) microaxial flow pumps are commonly used in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and heart failure (HF) cardiogenic shock (CS). Contemporary data from large, unselected populations are needed to understand differences between these groups.

Methods

The Cardiogenic Shock Working Group (CSWG) registry enrolls patients with CS at 36 international sites. We analyzed patients with Impella CP enrolled from 2019–2024, categorized by CS etiology and mechanical support device exposure. Baseline characteristics, complications, and outcomes were compared. Outcomes included survival to discharge, native heart survival, and heart replacement therapy. Multivariable analysis was performed to identify predictors of in-hospital mortality and complications.

Results

A total of 1486 patients with CS (57.9% AMI-CS, 34.9% HF-CS) and Impella CP were analyzed. Patients with HF-CS were younger (60 vs 64 years; p < 0.001) and more likely to have chronic kidney disease (26.4% vs 13.6; p < 0.001) than those with AMI-CS. Impella CP alone was used in 38.3%, CP+ECMO in 23.1%, and CP+ ≥ 2 other devices in 20.4%. Acute kidney injury was more common in HF-CS than AMI-CS (66.5% vs 59.7%, p = 0.03) and acute limb ischemia more common in AMI-CS than HF-CS (14.4% vs 11.0%; p = 0.05). Survival to discharge was 53.4% and was higher in HF-CS than AMI-CS (59.7% vs 49.8%; p < 0.001). Those with ≥ 2 other devices had the lowest survival (43.8%). Total device number was significantly associated with in-hospital mortality, limb ischemia, and bleeding.

Conclusions

Differences in baseline characteristics, device exposure, and hospital complications between patients with HF-CS and AMI-CS supported by Impella CP may influence outcomes.

Conclusions

Among patients who underwent PCI for AMI complicated by cardiogenic shock from October 2015 to December 2017, use of intravascular microaxial LVADs increased, with a corresponding decrease in use of IABPs despite limited clinical trial evidence of improved outcomes associated with device use. Significant hospital-level variation in use of MCS devices was also found.

Discussion

The current study demonstrates major changes in the use of short-term MCS over the last decade. Patients receiving MCS in recent years were younger and had more profound cardiogenic shock compared with patients receiving MCS in previous years. Interestingly, the choice of MCS device changed drastically from IABP to mostly Impella CP after the IABP-SHOCK II trial in 2012. Early application of Impella CP was associated with lower 30-day mortality compared with the matched controls, a trend that was not be observed among patients with early application of IABP.

Previous studies from Europe and the USA have demonstrated similar temporal trends regarding the choice of MCS system with decreasing use of IABP and increasing use of VA-ECMO, axial pump-related devices and Tandem Heart, but not to the same degree as observed in the present study. The abandonment of IABP coincides with the published results of the IABP-SHOCK II trial, and a similar change in practice has been reported from a single-centre in Berlin. The present study is the first study to delineate between the Impella family of devices and to highlight the increased application of Impella CP for AMICS in recent years. It should be noted that Impella V.2.5 was used in the early years; however, its use decreased concomitant with the abandonment of IABP following the introduction of Impella CP. Also, the initiation of the randomised DanGer Shock trial (NCT01633502) involving the Impella CP in 2013 and patient recruitment at the two participating institutions likely led to increased awareness of Impella CP. In addition, clinicians might have favoured the use of Impella CP over Impella V.2.5 given the increased blood flow by the Impella CP. Studies reporting on contemporary trends on patient populations receiving MCS is scarce, and this study shows that patients receiving MCS were younger and more haemodynamically compromised in recent years (2013–2017) compared with earlier years (2010–2012). MCS was applied in ~25% of cases in the post-IABP-SHOCK II era compared with ~50% in the pre-IABP-SHOCK II era, and was probably restricted to patients with more profound shock, explaining the more compromised haemodynamics of patients receiving MCS in recent years. This concept is further supported by the observed increase in mechanical ventilation, vasoactive drugs, dialysis and higher 30-day mortality in the MCS group from the post-IABP-SHOCK II era versus pre-IABP-SHOCK II era. Given the striking differences in the patient characteristics of those receiving MCS before and after 2012, we exclusively compared the treatment effects of early IABP/Impella CP in the two separate time eras.

### The management of cardiogenic shock from diagnosis to devices: a narrative review [^b4a324b3]. CHEST Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Percutaneous Ventricular Assist Device: Impella:

The Impella (Abiomed, Inc.) is a percutaneously implanted, transvalvular, axial flow pump. Axial flow is produced by an impeller that traverses the aortic valve and expels blood from the LV into the ascending aorta. The two available models for LV support are Impella CP (providing up to 4 L/min of flow) and Impella 5.5 (providing up to 5.5 L/min of flow). The CP is inserted femorally via a 14-F sheath, whereas the 5.5 is inserted via a 23-F sheath through a surgical axillary cutdown and graft. Hemodynamically, the Impella directly unloads the LV and augments CO, reducing wall stress and end-diastolic pressure and volume. Limitations of the Impella include access site complications resulting from large-bore cannulation, as well as significant risk for hemolysis (with associated renal failure) and thrombocytopenia, especially with the Impella CP. Impella placement requires fluoroscopy and, in the case of the Impella 5.5, surgical cutdown and graft anastomosis; thus, the Impella typically is not an option for emergent bedside placement.

It is the opinion of the authors that, given the modest CO support and high rates of hemolysis and kidney injury, the Impella CP is no longer considered to be an adequate longitudinal shock device at many shock referral centers. Instead, the axillary-placed Impella 5.5, which also enables ongoing rehabilitation before heart replacement therapy, is preferred for more sustained support. –

In patients with AMI-CS, the Impella was compared with the IABP in the Impella vs IABP Reduces Mortality in STEMI Patients Treated With Primary PCI in Severe Cardiogenic Shock (IMPRESS) trial, which showed no mortality benefit for the Impella over the IABP. However, it is important to note that the trial design included patients who had progressed to profound hemometabolic CS, with > 90% of patients having experienced cardiac arrest. Observational data show inconsistent findings. Although the National Cardiogenic Shock Initiative touts early deployment of the Impella and demonstrated astounding inpatient survival rates of > 70%, a propensity-matched cohort study showed worse mortality with the Impella compared with the IABP and increased vascular complications. Additional randomized controlled trials are underway to assess the efficacy of the Impella in AMI-CS better. The lack of randomized data supporting the efficacy and usefulness of the Impella 5.5 device is notable.

### Mechanical circulatory support in cardiogenic shock: translating trial evidence into real-world practice [^5f994cdc]. Open Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

Was DANGER-SHOCK therefore was a quirk of fate in an unrepresentative population? Is Impella in AMI-CS harmful in the real world? Certainly not. While the inclusion criteria were selective, the DANGER-SHOCK investigators deliberately identified a population with the greatest chance of benefit, and the trial design was otherwise pragmatic and as 'real-world' as possible. Most importantly, randomisation in DANGER-SHOCK overcomes the selection bias and confounding which is endemic in the MCS literature. While there will inevitably be some natural variability in decision making, the choice to use and then escalate mechanical circulatory support devices is driven by deteriorating clinical status, while those who do not receive devices are more likely too well or have reached the point of futility. In the present study, markers of shock severity were less adverse in the group who did not receive mechanical support, with a shorter duration of symptoms, better haemodynamics, lesser degrees of myocardial injury and lower lactate levels, both before and after PCI. These differences persisted despite propensity matching, an indication of how far apart the populations were in clinical status. Unmeasured confounders also play a role, with many variables not captured in the prospective data set or routine clinical records and therefore unable to be adjusted for.

Patients presenting with AMI-CS who would meet criteria for enrolment in DANGER-SHOCK should not be denied the opportunity of mechanical circulatory support with Impella based on data of lower quality. The present data are, however, a warning against continued overuse of mechanical circulatory support devices and extrapolating the findings of DANGER-SHOCK to routine use or wider populations. Care is needed in patients with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction or who are comatose after a cardiac arrest, a population not represented in DANGER-SHOCK but a substantial proportion of patients undergoing primary angioplasty for shock in clinical practice. The consistent message of a lack of benefit from randomised trials and registry data should give pause to those considering implanting these devices outside of specific circumstances and on a rare case-by-case basis, with careful monitoring of use via the national societies where audits exist.

### DanGer shock criteria and outcomes in acute myocardial infarction-related cardiogenic shock treated with impella: the J-PVAD registry [^07c8c42f]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

The DanGer shock trial showed a survival benefit of Impella in highly selected patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction-related cardiogenic shock (STEMI-CS). In real-world settings, however, Impella is often used in broader populations not meeting trial criteria. This study aimed to assess the distribution and outcomes of DanGer shock-eligible and -ineligible acute myocardial infarction-related cardiogenic shock (AMI-CS) patients in a nationwide Japanese registry.

Methods

A total of 3975 AMI-CS patients treated with Impella between 2020 and 2023 were identified from the J-PVAD registry. Patients were stratified into five groups: eligible STEMI-CS, non-eligible STEMI-CS, out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), mechanical complications (MCs), and non-STEMI-CS (NSTEMI-CS). Eligible STEMI-CS was defined as STEMI-CS fulfilling all of the following: lactate ≥ 2.5 mmol/L, systolic blood pressure < 100 mmHg or catecholamine use, left ventricular ejection fraction < 45%, and shock onset to first Impella support ≤ 24 h. Thirty-day mortality, associated risk factors, and complications were examined across the five groups.

Results

Eligible STEMI-CS accounted for 35.6% of all AMI-CS cases, with a 30-day mortality of 37.6%. Non-eligible STEMI-CS patients had lower mortality (27.6%), but it increased significantly with advanced age, renal dysfunction, veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation use, ventricular arrhythmia, or sepsis. Thirty-day mortality was 51.3% in OHCA (63.4% without return of spontaneous circulation), 39.8% in MC, and 33.3% in NSTEMI-CS groups.

Conclusions

In this nationwide registry, one-third of AMI-CS patients treated with Impella met DanGer shock criteria. Outcomes in non-eligible subgroups were heterogeneous, highlighting the importance of individualized risk assessment in guiding Impella use in real-world practice.

### Percutaneous microaxial ventricular assist device versus intra-aortic balloon pump for nonacute myocardial infarction cardiogenic shock [^36d49e03]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our investigation of non‐AMICS using a nationally representative database revealed several important findings: (1) all analyses using measured confounding variables consistently showed higher mortality in patients undergoing pVAD than those treated with IABP; (2) however, the higher mortality with the use of pVAD was attenuated in the IV analysis; (3) no evidence was observed in the risk of in‐hospital complications between the use of pVAD and IABP in non‐AMICS; (4) the use of pVAD may be associated with higher health care spending in some settings.

Examining the clinical effectiveness of MCS devices is challenging because of the sample size issue of RCTs and unmeasured confounding in observational studies. Although several RCTs have been attempted, their power to detect the differences in hard end points may be limited by the small sample sizes ranging from 12 to 48 patients in each study. There are larger RCTs currently ongoing, including the Danish‐German cardiogenic shock (DanGer) trial (NCT01633502) and Early Impella Support in Patients With ST‐Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction Complicated by Cardiogenic Shock (RECOVER IV) trial (NCT05506449) with sample sizes of 360 to 560; however, these RCTs target AMICS, and no RCTs have investigated pVADs for non‐AMICS. Meanwhile, some comparative effectiveness studies on AMICS using observational data showed worse prognosis in patients treated with pVADs than those medically managed or treated with IABP, although the interpretations of these studies are subject to unmeasured confounding. A recent study implementing various causal inference methods, such as IV analysis, showed inconsistent results by different analytical approaches and emphasized the importance of adequately powered RCTs.

### Cardiogenic shock a Quarter Century Later: a dire outcome barely changed [^43e6ea60]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

High quality evidence guiding the use of temporary mechanical circulatory support is at least as sparse. While the intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) has been a staple of CS treatment for close to half a century, a large randomized controlled trial showed unequivocally that its routine use initiated after percutaneous coronary intervention does not reduce mortality of patients with CS complicating either STEMI or NSTEMI. Yet, in the current study, the CSWG investigators report that the IABP was the most commonly utilized MCS device at all-time points during the hospitalization, a phenomenon even more likely in most other geographies, where newer devices such as the axial flow pump Impella (Abiomed Inc) are simply unaffordable and unavailable as a treatment option.

The authors correctly point out that future trials must be conducted to determine the optimal setting and role of the IABP in the CS spectrum. Some avenues to explore might be in the timing of IABP support. While SHOCK-IABP 2 found no benefit from routine IABP use, the majority of devices were deployed after the PCI procedure, while 10% of patients randomized to control crossed over to IABP support. There is at least a suggestion from a retrospective single-center registry that placement of the IABP within the first hour of onset of shock is associated a 50% lower in-hospital mortality compared to later deployment. The size of the IABP deployed may be important as well. A 50 cc IABP provides significantly greater unloading than a 40 cc device, and in one single-center study its use resulted in very acceptable outcomes in CS patients, when utilized alone, or as a bridge to more advanced therapies.

AMI-CS mechanical support trends and outcomes in women: IABP use for AMI-CS declined from 28% in 2005 to 17.7% in 2014 after IABP-SHOCK II showed no 30‑day mortality benefit, while Impella use increased; tMCS use remains lower in women and in-hospital mortality is higher among women receiving tMCS; early Impella support pre-PCI in women showed survival 68.8% versus 24.4% (p = .005) in the international cVAD registry; in the RECOVER III registry, women with AMI-CS on ≥ 2 inotropes before MCS had higher adjusted mortality (OR, 3.03; 95% CI, 1.26–7.29); the randomized DanGer Shock trial in STEMI-CS showed reduced 180‑day mortality with Impella versus standard care (45.8% vs 58.5%; HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.55–0.99; P = 0.04), with 55.3% implanted before revascularization and median time to tMCS 14 minutes; the women subgroup did not show benefit (HR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.58–1.79), and randomization was not stratified by sex with only 20% women and no formal interaction test.

### Cardiogenic shock: searching for a better lifeboat [^395f03e0]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Over the past decade, there has been increasing interest in cardiogenic shock (CS), with several approaches being tried to reduce the ≈50% mortality observed at 30 days following diagnosis. The landscape is dominated by a scant evidence base, and those trials that exist have been uniformly disappointing. The largest trial in this space was a randomized trial of intra‐aortic balloon pump (IABP) versus standard of care following percutaneous coronary intervention complicated by CS and showed no survival benefit of IABP placement in CS complicating acute myocardial infarction. The microaxial continuous flow pump (Impella CP) was compared with the IABP in a small but critically ill population of patients with acute myocardial infarction and CS, and no difference in mortality was seen comparing the more potent pump with one that is associated with variable but lesser support. Concurrent with these trials has been the exponential increase in the use of venoarterial extracorporeal life support (VA‐ECLS), which provides a more robust hemodynamic support than either IABP or percutaneous microaxial flow pumps. The cost of equipment to support a patient with VA‐ECLS is relatively modest, and many components are already used in centers with cardiac surgery programs. VA‐ECLS is the most versatile platform, suitable to provide selective or complete biventricular support, depending on the cannulation strategy selected, and in some ways represents a lifeboat for patients on a proverbial sinking ship.

Increasing ECLS use has led to the recognition of the abnormal physiology imposed by retrograde aortic perfusion; in contrast to centrally cannulated cardiopulmonary bypass, which leads to decompression of the heart and lung circulation, peripheral VA‐ECLS causes flow‐dependent increases in left ventricular afterload, and clinical sequelae in critically ill patients. Reports of catastrophic left ventricular clot formation, pulmonary vascular congestion, and poor rates of recovery of left ventricular function have led to hybrid strategies, including VA‐ECLS and the addition of a "venting" strategy to reduce left ventricular pressure overload and enhance myocardial recovery. This is analogous to a leaky lifeboat, which is sustained by throwing water overboard as quickly as it accumulates. Such strategies vary from use of the IABP to reduce afterload intermittently, to implantation of an Impella device, as well as use of balloon atrial septostomy to "decompress" the left heart (which is pressurized by VA‐ECLS).

### Outcomes of patients supported on impella 5.5 for more than 14 days: a cardiogenic shock working group registry analysis [^6bef5c73]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The Impella 5.5 (ABIOMED, Danvers, MA) is a micro-axial pump that is currently approved for up to 14 days of support in the United States. However, in clinical practice it is being used for longer durations of time, especially as a bridge to heart replacement therapies (HRT). We aimed to define patient characteristics and outcomes (mortality and serious adverse events/ SAE) in patients supported on Impella 5.5 for > 14 days in a large, multi-center registry.

Methods

The CSWG registry enrolling consecutive patients in heart failure (HF) or myocardial infarction related CS (MI-CS) from 34 international sites between 2022–2024 was analyzed. Patients supported with Impella 5.5 > 14 days were compared to those supported for ≤ 14 days for baseline characteristics. In-hospital outcomes were further classified as 'favorable' (heart recovery, successful bridge to HRT and discharged alive) or 'unfavorable' (death, need for escalation to VA-ECMO). Predictors of favorable outcomes were assessed using uni- and multi-variable analysis.

Results

A total of 927 patients were supported on Impella 5.5 of whom 381 had the device for > 14 days. Median time of support in the 2 groups (> or ≤ 14 days) was 23.9 [21.2] and 7.1 [IQR 5.7] days, respectively. Patients with Impella 5.5 > 14 days were younger (mean age 57 vs 61 year. P < 0.001), more likely to have HF-CS vs MI-CS (78% vs 61%; p < 0.001) and have a dilated left ventricle (LVEDD 6.4 vs 5.9 cm, p = 0.002) and chronic kidney disease (38% vs 30%, p = 0.03) as compared to those supported ≤ 14 days. Baseline SCAI stage, lactate, and vital signs were not significantly different. Unadjusted survival was higher (80% vs 68%, p < 0.001) in those supported for > 14 days, with a significantly higher HRT for those supported for > 14 days, compared to the ≤ 14 days cohort (58% vs 38%, p < 0.001). Less than a fourth (19.1%) had an SAE, with highest rates seen in MI-CS supported for ≤ 14 days. The majority (75%) of patients on support for > 14 days had favorable outcomes with no linear increments in rates of SAE with prolonged duration of support.

Conclusion

Patients supported with Impella 5.5 beyond the FDA approved duration of 14 days had high rates of favorable outcomes, especially as bridge to HRT. Use of Impella 5.5 for longer durations needs to be further investigated in prospective studies.

### SCAI expert consensus statement on sex-specific considerations in myocardial revascularization [^fc388fc6]. Journal of the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography & Interventions (2022). High credibility.

ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) with cardiogenic shock in women is reported to involve higher frequencies of cardiogenic shock, heart failure, and right ventricular infarction than in men, and women have lower blood pressures and cardiac outputs; analyses from the SHOCK and CULPRIT-SHOCK trials failed to show a sex-specific benefit for intra-aortic balloon pump use or early multivessel revascularization. Although randomized data on mechanical circulatory support (MCS) are lacking, one registry (N = 180) found that women with cardiogenic shock (n = 49) had similar hemodynamic improvement and greater clinical benefit than men with early initiation of the Impella MCS device, while several studies suggest women with acute MI and shock were less likely to receive MCS devices.

### Management of cardiogenic shock: state-of-the-art [^36834a2b]. Intensive Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Mechanical circulatory support devices

Temporary mechanical circulatory support (tMCS, Figure 3) is a potential option for enhancing end-organ perfusion in patients with de novo or refractory CS. It provides short-term hemodynamic intervention lasting from hours to weeks, is usually managed in a hub-and-spoke system available in tertiary centers, and is serving as a bridge-to-decision, bridge-to-recovery, bridge-to-LVAD (left-ventricular assist device), or bridge-to-transplantation. Various tMCS configurations offer partial or complete circulatory support, including percutaneous, surgical, and hybrid platforms with and without oxygenation. Multiple combinations like venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO; also called ECLS) with microaxial flow pumps (Impella®) which some call ECMella or ECPella, VA-ECMO with an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP), BiPella (right- and left-ventricular microaxial flow pump), and left atrial-to-femoral artery support devices (TandemHeart™ or CentriMag™) with an left-ventricular (LV) Impella are feasible, addressing specific needs such as pulmonary support. tMCS devices operate through distinct mechanisms, delivering diverse types and levels of hemodynamic support, each associated with specific potential complications. A thorough comprehension of each device's risk/benefit profile is paramount for determining its role in managing different stages and etiologies of CS. Modern individualized therapy taking individual risks and benefits into account should still adhere to homogenous management plans which is an ongoing debate in CS, especially in the field of tMCS.

### Treatment of cardiogenic shock with left ventricular assist device combined with cardiac resynchronization therapy: a case report [^cef18d4a]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The mortality rate in patients with cardiogenic shock is still very high. Medical therapy has symptomatic effects, but has no proven reduction of mortality. Percutaneously placed LVAD is an option for selected groups of these patients. The percutaneous microaxial blood pump, Impella LP 2.5 ® (Abiomed; Aachen, Germany) can be rapidly deployed with low complication rates and have improved hemodynamic effects compared with the intraaortic balloon pump (IABP). Furthermore, in selected patients with stable heart failure, CRT is proven to relive symptoms and improve outcomes. The potential efficiency of acute and subacute CRT treatment in patients with cardiogenic shock has to our knowledge not been studied.

### Association of use of an intravascular microaxial left ventricular assist device vs intra-aortic balloon pump with in-hospital mortality and major bleeding among patients with acute myocardial infarction complicated by cardiogenic shock [^babd3c8a]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) complicated by cardiogenic shock is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Although intravascular microaxial left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) provide greater hemodynamic support as compared with intra-aortic balloon pumps (IABPs), little is known about clinical outcomes associated with intravascular microaxial LVAD use in clinical practice.

Objective

To examine outcomes among patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for AMI complicated by cardiogenic shock treated with mechanical circulatory support (MCS) devices.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A propensity-matched registry-based retrospective cohort study of patients with AMI complicated by cardiogenic shock undergoing PCI between October 1, 2015, and December 31, 2017, who were included in data from hospitals participating in the CathPCI and the Chest Pain-MI registries, both part of the American College of Cardiology's National Cardiovascular Data Registry. Patients receiving an intravascular microaxial LVAD were matched with those receiving IABP on demographics, clinical history, presentation, infarct location, coronary anatomy, and clinical laboratory data, with final follow-up through December 31, 2017.

Exposures

Hemodynamic support, categorized as intravascular microaxial LVAD use only, IABP only, other (such as use of a percutaneous extracorporeal ventricular assist system, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, or a combination of MCS device use), or medical therapy only.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcomes were in-hospital mortality and in-hospital major bleeding.

Results

Among 28 304 patients undergoing PCI for AMI complicated by cardiogenic shock, the mean (SD) age was 65.0 (12.6) years, 67.0% were men, 81.3% had an ST-elevation myocardial infarction, and 43.3% had cardiac arrest. Over the study period among patients with AMI, an intravascular microaxial LVAD was used in 6.2% of patients, and IABP was used in 29.9%. Among 1680 propensity-matched pairs, there was a significantly higher risk of in-hospital death associated with use of an intravascular microaxial LVAD (45.0%) vs with an IABP (34.1% [absolute risk difference, 10.9 percentage points {95% CI, 7.6–14.2}; P < .001) and also higher risk of in-hospital major bleeding (intravascular microaxial LVAD [31.3%] vs IABP [16.0%]; absolute risk difference, 15.4 percentage points [95% CI, 12.5–18.2]; P < .001). These associations were consistent regardless of whether patients received a device before or after initiation of PCI.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients undergoing PCI for AMI complicated by cardiogenic shock from 2015 to 2017, use of an intravascular microaxial LVAD compared with IABP was associated with higher adjusted risk of in-hospital death and major bleeding complications, although study interpretation is limited by the observational design. Further research may be needed to understand optimal device choice for these patients.

### Percutaneous coronary intervention in multivessel disease and infarct-related cardiogenic shock: a danGer shock substudy [^0517c73d]. JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The optimal percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) strategy in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)-related cardiogenic shock and multivessel disease remains uncertain.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to investigate the association between PCI strategy and outcomes in STEMI-related cardiogenic shock and multivessel disease.

Methods

This exploratory substudy of the DanGer Shock (Danish-German Cardiogenic Shock) multicenter trial included patients with STEMI-related cardiogenic shock and multivessel disease, excluding comatose patients resuscitated from cardiac arrest. Multivessel disease was defined by ≥ 1 nonculprit angiographic stenosis ≥ 70%. Patients with an isolated left main culprit were excluded. The planned PCI strategy was registered before randomization. All analyses were performed according to as-treated PCI strategy (immediate multivessel PCI or culprit-only PCI). The primary outcome was all-cause mortality within 180 days; secondary outcomes included renal replacement therapy and acute kidney injury.

Results

Of 355 patients included in the DanGer Shock trial, 221 (72%) had multivessel disease; of these, 118 (53%) were treated with culprit-only PCI and 103 (47%) with immediate multivessel PCI. The median pre-PCI SYNTAX (Synergy Between PCI With Taxus and Cardiac Surgery) scores were 28 (Q1-Q3: 22–32) and 29 (Q1-Q3: 22–34), respectively. Chronic total occlusion PCI was performed in 6 of 103 patients (6%) treated with immediate multivessel PCI. All-cause mortality was 72 (61%; 95% CI: 52%-70%) in the culprit-only group and 52 (50%; 95% CI: 41%-60%) in the immediate multivessel PCI group (adjusted OR: 0.40; 95% CI: 0.19–0.83) over a median follow-up period of 45 days (Q1-Q3: 2–180 days). Immediate multivessel PCI was not associated with the secondary outcomes. There was no interaction according to randomization allocation and PCI strategy (P = 1.00).

Conclusions

Immediate multivessel PCI was associated with 60% lower odds of all-cause mortality compared with culprit-only PCI.

Conclusions

This observational study using the Medicare claim database implemented multiple analytical approaches and showed that the use of pVAD compared with IABP was associated with higher mortality in patients with non‐AMICS. Adequately powered high‐quality RCTs are warranted to determine the clinical effects of pVAD in non‐AMICS.

### Combined risk stratification with patient characteristics and biomarkers in patients Treated with the impella for cardiogenic shock [^41d475f4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Cardiogenic shock (CS) is a catastrophic condition characterized by low cardiac output, leading to organ malperfusion and tissue hypoxia. Despite the advances in therapeutic strategies in recent decades, in‐hospital mortality in patients with CS remains high, ranging from 40% to 50% in the current era. To achieve hemodynamic stability, percutaneous mechanical circulatory support (MCS) devices, such as intra‐aortic balloon pumping (IABP), venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and microaxial ventricular assist device (Impella, Abiomed, Danvers, MA), may be indicated in patients with CS. The left‐sided Impella devices have a transvalvular pump with an inlet that resides within the left ventricle and an outlet in the aorta to provide continuous blood flow for supporting hemodynamics along with left ventricular unloading. Although the Impella may have a theoretical potential as a superior MCS device over others, clinical evidence has been lacking, and nonrandomized studies have counterintuitively indicated that the device may be related to higher risks of complications including major bleeding, stroke, and all‐cause mortality., Recently, a randomized control trial showed a survival benefit of the Impella use in patients with ST‐segment–elevation myocardial infarction (MI) complicated by CS, but the rates of major complications were substantially higher in those receiving the Impella devices. Given the high mortality and complication rates, early and accurate risk stratification is clinically relevant in patients with CS treated with the Impella. The risk score‐based approach may aid in clinical decision‐making and subsequent therapeutic interventions. In this context, biomarkers are useful for objective risk assessment. In the present study, we developed a risk‐predicting model using baseline characteristics and biomarkers in patients treated with the Impella devices in a setting of CS.

Introduction — cardiogenic shock (CS) is described as a complex, heterogenous, multifactorial syndrome in which a cardiac disorder results in insufficient cardiac output culminating in end-organ hypoperfusion. CS is one of the most common causes of admission to contemporary cardiac intensive care units and remains a highly morbid and lethal complication, with short-term mortality ranging from 30% to 40% and 1-year mortality approaching or exceeding 50%. CS due to acute myocardial infarction (AMI-CS) has been the most extensively studied form of CS in randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

### Percutaneous microaxial ventricular assist device versus intra-aortic balloon pump for nonacute myocardial infarction cardiogenic shock [^641c1abb]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Limitations

Our study had several limitations. First, as is the case for any observational studies, we could not fully account for unmeasured confounding factors. In particular, several clinically relevant factors were unavailable from the claim database, such as left ventricular ejection fraction, serum lactate, or the Society of Cardiovascular Angiography & Interventions CS classification. Second, not all of the ICD‐10 codes used for data extraction were validated. For example, although we used the same codes as in a previously published study, and further tested different definitions of bleeding to ensure our findings, the reliability of ICD‐10 codes in identifying the clinical impact of each bleeding event (such as amount or severity) may still be uncertain. Similarly, the sensitivity of the vasopressor use may be under‐reported, although a previous study using the same database showed similar numbers. Third, although IV analysis could hypothetically overcome unmeasured confounding, the baseline characteristics by the level of institutional pVAD use were not well‐balanced, possibly suggesting the violation of the exclusion restriction and exchangeability assumptions. Furthermore, the results of the IV analyses should be interpreted with caution because the relevance of the instrument to the treatment assignment might have led to wide confidence intervals. Fourth, we performed complete case analyses for the assessment of health care spending by linking the 20% random sample Carrier file, which means that our findings regarding health care spending were relatively underpowered. Fifth, our data were not able to distinguish different types of pVAD, such as Impella CP, Impella RP, or Impella 5.5. While they are recorded as the same code in the database, each type has different characteristics, including diameters of the introducers, approaches to access, flow support, and maximum durations of use. For instance, a retrospective study showed that patients treated with Impella 5.5 had lower mortality and higher incidence of the successful bridge to heart replacement therapies than those treated with Impella 5.0, although the observed magnitude would not overturn our findings. Because these differences in devices may affect mortality and risks of complications, further research will be needed to better understand the optimal device choice for these patients.

### Percutaneous microaxial ventricular assist device versus intra-aortic balloon pump for nonacute myocardial infarction cardiogenic shock [^60b80b70]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

The benefits of MCS devices should always be discussed in the context of complications, such as bleeding. The IMPella versus IABP Reduces mortality in STEMI patients treated with primary PCI in Severe cardiogenic SHOCK (IMPRESS) trial showed that the incidence of major bleeding was higher in the pVAD group than in the IABP group. Observational studies also showed higher risks of bleeding in patients with AMICS treated using pVAD compared with those treated using IABP. In our study, however, we did not find increased incidences of bleeding in patients treated with pVAD. Generally, patients with acute myocardial infarction receive dual antiplatelet therapy along with revascularization. Because antiplatelet therapy can increase the risk of bleeding, the higher risk of bleeding in patients undergoing pVAD in previous studies targeting AMICS can also be attributed to the addition of antiplatelet therapy to pVAD, which may explain the difference in the association of pVAD with bleeding events between previous studies and the present study. This finding suggested that excess bleeding may not be the only attributable factor of higher mortality with the use of pVAD as reported in previous studies on AMICS. Meanwhile, the difference in the safety profile according to the cause of CS can be taken into account when selecting a treatment strategy, although further studies are needed to clarify this aspect.

### Clinical use and impact of mechanical circulatory support for myocardial infarction-related cardiogenic shock in the Netherlands: a registry-based propensity-matched analysis [^ca04de38]. Open Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cardiogenic shock (CS) is described as a life-threatening condition of hypoxaemia and end-organ hypoperfusion and is caused by low-cardiac output. Although acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is the primary cause of CS, the presence of CS is only observed in 3%–10% of all AMI patients. Whereas mortality rates of AMI without CS have decreased over the years, mortality rates in patients with CS due to AMI (AMI-CS) continue to linger around 40%–50%.

Mechanical circulatory support (MCS) seems an intuitive manner to assist the endangered circulation in AMI-CS patients. Around 20%–25% of the AMI-CS patients in Europe are treated with MCS devices, including the intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP), Impella, venoarterial-extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) or a combination of the aforementioned devices. In the USA, around 40% of the AMI-CS patients receive MCS. Since the results of the IABP-SHOCK-II trial, the use of IABP has rapidly decreased in the setting of AMI-CS. The use of Impella and VA-ECMO on the other hand has been increasing ever since. The evidence from randomised studies supporting the usage of MCS devices in patients suffering from AMI-CS is, however, limited. In fact, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating routine use of MCS, including IABP and VA-ECMO, in AMI-CS patients have not shown any survival benefit. Only the recently published, long-awaited, DanGer Shock trial demonstrated a survival benefit at 180 days of Impella over standard of care alone (SOC) in a highly selected ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) CS population. This study is only recently published and various subanalyses will be needed to understand its implications for the overall field of CS.

Data on patient and procedural characteristics and clinical outcomes in patients receiving MCS in the Netherlands are scarce. Obtaining a better understanding of the treatment of AMI-CS patients, specifically the use of MCS, could aid clinical decision-making and create awareness for clinical outcomes. This large, real-world retrospective registry, therefore, has three objectives. First, to evaluate the extent of use of different MCS devices in AMI-CS patients in the Netherlands. Second, to identify patient characteristics associated with MCS usage and third, to evaluate and compare clinical outcomes of MCS and non-MCS patients in a real-world setting.
