## Question

A 4-year-old boy is brought to the pediatrician with fever, diarrhea and bilateral red eye for 7 days. His parents noted that he has never had an episode of diarrhea this prolonged, but several other children at daycare had been ill. His immunization history is up to date. His vitals are normal except for a temperature of 37.5°C (99°F). A physical exam is significant for mild dehydration, preauricular adenopathy, and bilateral conjunctival injection with watery discharge. What is the most likely diagnosis?\\n
A. Rotavirus infection
B. C. difficile colitis
C. Adenovirus infection
D. Vibrio parahaemolyticus infection

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about determining the most likely diagnosis in a 4-year-old with fever, diarrhea, and bilateral conjunctivitis with preauricular lymphadenopathy, and how to compare adenovirus with rotavirus, C. difficile, and Vibrio parahaemolyticus. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the triad of symptoms and which pathogens classically produce both gastrointestinal and ocular disease. Then, I should verify the epidemiologic clues, especially daycare exposure and sick contacts. Next, I will examine the ocular findings, particularly the significance of watery discharge and preauricular nodes. After that, I need to check the gastrointestinal features and duration to see what fits best. Finally, I will systematically rule out the competing diagnoses and confirm why adenovirus is the best fit before outlining management and precautions.

> Let me first confirm the illness script. The combination of fever, diarrhea, and bilateral conjunctivitis with preauricular lymphadenopathy in a daycare-exposed child strongly suggests a viral etiology with systemic and ocular involvement, and adenovirus is the prototypical pathogen that produces this constellation, including pharyngoconjunctival fever and epidemic keratoconjunctivitis syndromes, which often include fever, URI symptoms, conjunctivitis, and preauricular nodes [^112rQKH5] [^114DrM7v].

> Wait, let me verify the epidemiology before I anchor on a diagnosis. The history of multiple sick contacts in daycare aligns with adenovirus transmission patterns, which spread efficiently via person-to-person contact and contaminated surfaces and are frequently implicated in pediatric outbreaks of conjunctivitis and respiratory-gastrointestinal syndromes, supporting adenovirus as the leading consideration here [^114DrM7v] [^112nmVA2].

> I will now examine the ocular findings more closely. Bilateral conjunctival injection with watery discharge and preauricular lymphadenopathy are classic for viral conjunctivitis, and preauricular nodes in particular increase the likelihood of a viral etiology substantially, with positive likelihood ratios reported around 2.5–5.6 in high-quality evidence syntheses; adenovirus accounts for the majority of viral conjunctivitis cases, and its course is typically self-limited over 5–14 days, which fits this presentation [^112ByJSW] [^112rQKH5] [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should review the gastrointestinal features against the ocular picture. The child has diarrhea with mild dehydration and a several-day course, which is compatible with adenoviral gastroenteritis, and the simultaneous presence of conjunctivitis with preauricular nodes makes a systemic viral syndrome more likely than a purely enteric pathogen; adenovirus is well described to cause both diarrheal disease and ocular surface infection, including in pediatric outbreaks, reinforcing the coherence of this diagnosis [^112nmVA2] [^114DrM7v].

> Next, I should review the competing options. Rotavirus can cause prolonged diarrhea in children, but it does not typically cause conjunctivitis or preauricular lymphadenopathy, so the ocular findings argue against rotavirus as the unifying diagnosis here. C. difficile is uncommon in immunocompetent, appropriately vaccinated children without recent antibiotic exposure and would not explain the conjunctivitis. Vibrio parahaemolyticus is associated with seafood exposure and watery diarrhea but not with conjunctivitis or preauricular nodes, making it epidemiologically and clinically mismatched in this case [^notfound].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I briefly wondered about measles given the fever and conjunctivitis, but I should double-check the immunization status and the absence of cough, coryza, and rash. The child is up to date on vaccines and lacks the classic measles prodrome and exanthem, which makes measles unlikely despite conjunctivitis being part of that syndrome [^111AFVPV] [^111AzQT1].

> Let me consider other ocular-glandular syndromes. Parinaud oculoglandular syndromes such as Bartonella or tularemia can present with unilateral granulomatous conjunctivitis and regional nodes, but this child has bilateral watery conjunctivitis with a daycare outbreak pattern and no animal exposures or unilateral granulomas, which lowers the likelihood of those entities. Still, I should keep them in mind if the course is atypical or unilateral granulomatous features emerge [^112re41U] [^116r3YgH].

> I should confirm the diagnostic approach. In a clinically classic presentation like this, routine viral testing is not required. Supportive care, strict hygiene to limit transmission, and counseling on the self-limited course are appropriate, with ophthalmology referral if there is severe pain, visual change, corneal involvement, or lack of improvement within the expected window. If testing is pursued, adenovirus antigen assays or PCR can be considered, but results rarely change management in straightforward cases [^117Pgase] [^114ZswsT] [^113vUuZU].

> Putting this together, the most likely diagnosis is adenovirus infection causing a pharyngoconjunctival fever–like syndrome with diarrhea and preauricular lymphadenopathy. The triad of fever, watery bilateral conjunctivitis with preauricular nodes, and diarrhea in a daycare-exposed, immunized child fits adenovirus better than rotavirus, C. difficile, or Vibrio, none of which plausibly unify both the ocular and gastrointestinal findings in this epidemiologic context [^112rQKH5] [^1138Wf4y] [^112ByJSW].

---

The most likely diagnosis is **adenovirus infection** [^112rQKH5], given the triad of fever, diarrhea, and bilateral conjunctivitis with watery discharge, plus preauricular lymphadenopathy and daycare exposure [^112ByJSW]. Adenovirus is the **most common cause of viral conjunctivitis** in children [^1138Wf4y] and often presents with systemic symptoms, including gastrointestinal involvement [^112nmVA2]. Rotavirus would not explain the conjunctivitis, C. difficile is unlikely in a healthy, immunized child without antibiotic exposure, and Vibrio parahaemolyticus is inconsistent with the ocular findings and epidemiology [^notfound].

## Clinical features supporting adenovirus infection

Adenovirus infection **classically presents** with the following features, which align with this patient's presentation:

- **Fever**: Common in pediatric adenovirus infections [^notfound].
- **Conjunctivitis**: Bilateral conjunctival injection with watery discharge is characteristic of adenoviral conjunctivitis [^112rQKH5].
- **Preauricular lymphadenopathy**: Strongly associated with viral conjunctivitis, particularly adenovirus [^112rQKH5].
- **Gastrointestinal symptoms**: Diarrhea is a recognized manifestation of adenovirus infection, especially in children [^notfound].
- **Daycare exposure**: Adenovirus is highly contagious and commonly spreads in childcare settings [^112rQKH5].

---

## Differential diagnosis

| **Condition** | **Clinical features** | **Consistency with presentation** |
|-|-|-|
| Adenovirus infection | - Fever <br/> - Bilateral conjunctivitis with watery discharge <br/> - Preauricular lymphadenopathy <br/> - Diarrhea <br/> - Daycare exposure | Highly consistent |
| Rotavirus infection | - Fever <br/> - Diarrhea <br/> - Vomiting <br/> - No conjunctivitis | Inconsistent (no conjunctivitis) |
| C. difficile colitis | - Diarrhea <br/> - Abdominal pain <br/> - Recent antibiotic use <br/> - No conjunctivitis | Inconsistent (no conjunctivitis, no antibiotic exposure) |
| Vibrio parahaemolyticus infection | - Diarrhea <br/> - Abdominal pain <br/> - Seafood exposure <br/> - No conjunctivitis | Inconsistent (no conjunctivitis, no seafood exposure) |

---

## Conclusion

The patient's clinical presentation — fever, diarrhea, bilateral conjunctivitis with watery discharge, preauricular lymphadenopathy, and daycare exposure — is most consistent with **adenovirus infection** [^112rQKH5]. The other options are less likely given the absence of conjunctivitis or incompatible epidemiological factors.

Case presentation

On January 16, 2016, a six-year-old male presented with two days of swelling of the right maxillofacial region with fever and two hours of weakness. He was diagnosed with noma and septic shock, and was admitted to the PMICU at Xinhua Hospital of Shanghai Jiao Tong University in Shanghai, China. The patient is of Chinese Han nationality/ethnicity. He had access to a clean water source, no previous related disease, no weight loss, no history of direct contact with poultry and feces, good general nutritional status, was up to date on his immunizations (at the appropriate age according to national regulations), an absence of any known family history of immunodeficiencies, with unknown sanitation in the home and with unknown oral hygiene status.

The right side of the mouth and the maxillofacial area were swollen and tender 36 h before admission. Then, the swollen area gradually expanded to the entire region of the right maxillofacial tissues. Moreover, the local skin color developed to a darkened red, and his temperature was noted to be 39.4 °C. Two hours before admission, the patient lacked energy and developed significant weakness. One day after the onset of symptoms, the patient developed diarrhea, passing seven to eight loose stools per day.

Admission examination revealed the following: a weight of 23.0 kg (71.0% for 6-year-old boy), a height of 123 cm (85.4% for 6-year-old boy), and a BMI of 15.20. The patient was listless (mental status), had a temperature of 37.4 °C, a heart rate of 163 beats/min, a respiratory rate of 24 breaths/min, a blood pressure of 60/40 mmHg, and a SaO₂ of 90%. Results of the laboratory examinations are shown in Table 1.

### Comprehensive profile of pathogens and antimicrobial resistance in conjunctivitis cases from Niger [^116uEnfF]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2023). Medium credibility.

Human adenoviruses are nonenveloped, double-stranded DNA viruses and are one of the most frequent etiological agents for respiratory tract infections and acute viral conjunctivitis worldwide. Human adenoviruses are classified into seven species (A–G) that are subdivided further into genotypes. Conjunctivitis outbreaks are generally associated with various HAdV-D genotypes, although ocular involvement resulting from genotypes HAdV-B, HAdV-C, and HAdV-E have been detected. In our study, we detected multiple species (B, C, and F) associated with acute conjunctivitis. This HAdV profile appears more diverse than in neighboring Burkina Faso, although the differences may also be attributed to seasonality or small sample size.

Various bacteria-associated etiologies of infectious conjunctivitis were also identified. Both gram-negative (H. influenza, H. aegyptius, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Moraxell a spp.) and gram-positive (S. aureus and S. pneumoniae) bacteria were detected. Haemophilus aegyptius was found to be the causative pathogen in a 3-year-old boy who presented with bilateral purulent conjunctivitis. Haemophilus aegyptius was first identified by Kochin Egyptian patients with conjunctivitis and was known to cause outbreaks. In the 1980s, H. aegyptius was also associated with Brazilian purpuric fever epidemics during which infected children presented with purulent conjunctivitis that progressed to systemic symptoms including fever, gastrointestinal distress, and purpura fulminans. Disease progression is an otherwise previously healthy child is rapid, and death can occur. As SCORPIO is a disease surveillance study, and follow-up visits are not included in the study design, it is unknown whether the child with H. aegyptius detected in this study developed systemic sequalae.

### Conjunctivitis preferred practice pattern [^117Pgase]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Diagnostic tests for conjunctivitis are selectively used; some cases can be diagnosed on the basis of history and examination, but in other cases additional diagnostic tests may be helpful. Cultures for routine conjunctivitis in the absence of listed risk factors are rarely cost-effective or helpful in deciding on the treatment course, and cultures of the conjunctiva are indicated in all cases of suspected infectious neonatal conjunctivitis. Bacterial cultures and antibiotic susceptibility testing may be helpful for recurrent, severe, or chronic purulent conjunctivitis in any age group and in cases where the conjunctivitis has not responded to medication. Viral diagnostic tests are not routinely used in practice to establish the diagnosis of adenovirus, but they may prevent misdiagnosis, disease spread, unnecessary antibiotic use, increased health care costs, and lost productivity.

### Intraglandular toxoplasmic lymphadenitis of the parotid gland [^111Sgkzn]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Most preauricular masses are parotid neoplasms; however, some infectious and inflammatory causes may exhibit similar presentation. Toxoplasmosis is a worldwide parasitary disease. The clinical presentation of toxoplasmosis is mostly asymptomatic and may include subfebrile fever, fatigue, and lymphadenopathy. Only 13 clinical reports of intraglandular toxoplasmic lymphadenitis have been previously reported in the English literature. A careful history and examination with appropriate investigations, including immunoglobulin G avidity assay, will frequently provide the diagnosis of intraparotid toxoplasmosis. Surgery might therefore have been delayed or avoided depending on a satisfactory clinical improvement in consequence of proper medical treatment.

Tularemia is a rare disease but shows an approximately 10-fold increase in reported cases over the last 15 years in Germany. Clinical symptoms of acute tularemia infection are various, which often delays diagnosis. This case report gives an overview of the clinical manifestations of acute tularemia and shows the importance of interdisciplinary work to shorten the time from the onset of symptoms to effective treatment in infection with Francisella tularensis.

### Guide to utilization of the microbiology laboratory for diagnosis of infectious diseases: 2024 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) [^113JSygw]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Conjunctivitis — presentation, common etiologies, and testing considerations are outlined. Conjunctivitis is characterized by a "red eye" (ie, significant conjunctival hyperemia) over the bulbar conjunctiva and/or palpebral/tarsal conjunctiva often associated with irritation and discharge. Diagnostic testing is rarely indicated given characteristic clinical presentations. Viral conjunctivitis is most commonly bilateral with serous, watery discharge and known sick contacts, allergic conjunctivitis is uniformly bilateral with watery discharge and grayish, scant, stringy mucus with an associated situational atopy history, and bacterial conjunctivitis is typically unilateral with more purulent discharge, matting and adherence of eyelids on waking. Adenovirus is the most common cause of viral conjunctivitis (34%–80%). In adults, S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, and H. influenzae are the most frequent causes of bacterial conjunctivitis, whereas H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae, and Moraxella spp. are most common in children. C. trachomatis is associated with neonatal and sexually transmitted conjunctivitis in developed nations and is the leading cause of infectious blindness (trachoma) in developing nations. N. gonorrhoeae conjunctivitis is a rapidly progressive medical emergency; high-risk individuals include neonates, infants, and sexually active adults, and to mitigate rapid ocular damage every effort should be made for Gram stains from ocular specimens to be reported in < 1 hour. Neonatal conjunctivitis is also caused by HSV inoculated at the time of vaginal delivery and although rare, P. aeruginosa can cause life-threatening neonatal conjunctivitis in hospitalized infants.

CASE

History and Clinical Examination

A previously healthy 2-year-old girl was taken to her primary care physician on day 1 of symptom onset with a fever reaching 40 °C and mild diarrhea. On day 4, she was prescribed cefcapene pivoxil. She was referred to our hospital on day 8 with continued fever. There was no medical history of note, and her immunization history was up to date. There were no pets in the home, and she had no history of allergies. On admission, heart rate was 152 beats/min, respiratory rate was 28 breaths/min, blood pressure was 115/98 mm Hg, body temperature was 38.0 °C and oxygen saturation was 99% on room air. Capillary refill time was normal. On physical examination, her general condition was rather poor. No cough or nasal discharge was noted. There was no conjunctival hyperemia, strawberry tongue or lip redness. Her pharynx was slightly reddened, but no cervical lymphadenopathy was noted. On chest auscultation, breath sounds were normal with no pulmonary rales. No heart murmur was heard. The abdomen was soft on palpation, and bowel peristalsis was normal. There was no redness at the bacille Calmette-Guerin vaccination site. Three 3-mm papules were observed on the lower extremities and trunk.

Initial laboratory investigations revealed a white blood cell count of 12.7 × 10⁹/L (normal 4.0–11.9), with 71% granulocytes and 25% lymphocytes, hemoglobin of 9.5 g/dL (normal 10.9–14.2), platelet count of 313 × 10⁹/L (normal 180–460), C-reactive protein level of 73.0 mg/L (normal ≤ 3), erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 107 mm/60 min (normal), serum aspartate aminotransferase level of 29 U/L (normal 24–50), alanine aminotransferase 11 U/L (normal 9–34), lactate dehydrogenase level of 353 U/L (normal 195–400) and serum creatinine level of 0.25 mg/dL (normal 0.17–0.45). Antigen tests for respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, and group A streptococcus were negative. Findings on a chest radiograph (X-ray) are shown in Figure 1.

### SHEA practice update: infection prevention and control (IPC) in residential facilities for pediatric patients and their families [^111AFVPV]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). High credibility.

Measles — background for infection prevention in residential facilities describes a highly contagious viral infection spread when an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks, with infection occurring by breathing contaminated air (the virus stays in the air for up to two hours) or by touching a contaminated surface and then the eyes, noses, or mouths. Measles commonly presents with fever, cough, nasal congestion, conjunctivitis (pink eye), and a red rash that begins on the face then spreads to the entire body, and complications can include ear infections, pneumonia, croup, hepatitis, encephalitis, and diarrhea. Individuals are contagious from 4 days before the onset of rash through 4 days after the rash appears. Measles remains a leading cause of childhood disease and death globally, with recent outbreaks due to importation by travelers and infections in individuals who are immunized incompletely.

### A review of the differential diagnosis of acute infectious conjunctivitis: implications for treatment and management [^114DrM7v]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Guidelines and criteria for diagnosing and treating acute infectious conjunctivitis based on natural history and etiology are available. However, greater awareness of and adherence to differential diagnosis should be kept in mind to improve outcomes in patients presenting with suspected acute infectious conjunctivitis.

Epidemiology and Clinical Presentation

Discriminating features of viral, bacterial, and allergic acute conjunctivitis are summarized in Table 1.

Table 1
Discriminating Clinical Features of Suspected Acute Conjunctivitis

Viral Conjunctivitis

Adenoviruses are the cause of most (65–90%) cases of viral conjunctivitis, while the herpes simplex virus (HSV) is the cause of 1.3–4.8% of all cases of acute conjunctivitis. Other viruses that are associated with conjunctivitis include varicella (herpes) zoster virus (VZV) and Molluscum contagiosum.

Adenoviruses are nonenveloped viruses that are relatively resistant to disinfection. Adenoviral conjunctivitis is highly contagious, due in part to the capacity of the virus to survive in a desiccated state at room temperature for several weeks. Transmission risk is 10–50%, and the infection may spread via personal contact or indirectly through shared items. Adenoviral conjunctivitis is self-limiting, with improvement of signs and symptoms within 5–14 days. Often, the condition presents as unilateral in early phases and eventually spreads to both eyes.

Adenovirus serotypes are associated with different types of ocular infection, including pharyngoconjunctival fever and epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (EKC; patient photos shown in Figure 1). Pharyngoconjunctivitis typically manifests bilaterally with fever and enlargement of the periauricular lymph nodes.EKC is more severe because of the adverse effect it can have on visual acuity; it is characterized by watery discharge, swelling, and redness, and involvement of lymph nodes on both sides of the neck.EKC is highly contagious, and asymptomatic patients who have contracted the disease may unknowingly spread the virus.

### Parinaud's oculoglandular syndrome attributable to an encounter with a wild rabbit [^116F66yD]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

To describe the clinical and histopathologic findings in a patient with Parinaud's oculoglandular syndrome attributable to Francisella tularensis obtained from an encounter with a wild baby rabbit.

Methods

In an 18-year-old man, the clinical course, laboratory findings, and histopathologic findings are described.

Results

Parinaud's oculoglandular syndrome should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a patient presenting with unilateral granulomatous conjunctivitis, painful preauricular, and submandibular lymphadenopathy combined with systemic symptoms of general malaise and fever.

Conclusion

Tularemia is one etiology of Parinaud's oculoglandular syndrome. It is caused by Francisella tularensis and is usually transmitted to humans via infected animal blood or through an insect bite, most often a tick. For treatment, intramuscular streptomycin is the drug of choice.

A nine-month-old boy presented to his paediatrician with an eight-day history of diarrhoea. He had no significant medical history, normal growth and development, and was fully immunised, including Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG). He was admitted for management of dehydration and acute kidney injury, which responded well to intravenous fluid therapy. On the second day of admission he developed high-grade fever, rash, and multiorgan dysfunction (encephalopathy, transaminitis, bicytopenia, and coagulopathy). He was started on empiric intravenous ceftriaxone for suspected sepsis and was transferred to a paediatric referral hospital for further assessment.

Clinical examination revealed an acutely ill child with pallor, cervical lymphadenopathy, and oedematous hands and feet. He was tachycardic and pyrexial, with normal perfusion and blood pressure. An erythematous, maculopapular rash was noted over the trunk, axillae, and limbs. Nonexudative conjunctivitis and red, fissured lips were present. He was lethargic, with no meningism or focal signs. Abdominal palpation revealed hepatomegaly, but no splenomegaly. Laboratory investigations (Fig. 1) demonstrated hyperferritinaemia, bicytopenia, transaminitis, hypofibrinogenaemia, elevated D-dimer, and hypertriglyceridaemia, which prompted concern of MAS. Nasopharyngeal aspirate PCR was HAdV-positive; cycle threshold (Ct) value was not available at retrospective investigation. Urine culture revealed extended-spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL) Klebsiella pneumoniae and Candida albicans. In light of clear urine dipsticks and polymicrobial growth, this likely represented contamination. Further work-up is summarised in Table 1. Echocardiography on the first day of admission demonstrated normal function and normal coronary vessels.

### Conjunctivitis preferred practice pattern [^117SCu5M]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Conjunctivitis diagnosis — initial evaluation and history should include the relevant aspects of the comprehensive medical eye evaluation, but some elements may be deferred in patients with symptoms and signs suggestive of infectious conjunctivitis; questions about the patient history may elicit helpful information on symptoms and signs (e.g., conjunctival injection, mattering and adherence of eyelids, itching, tearing, discharge, irritation, pain, photophobia, blurred vision), duration of symptoms and time course, exacerbating factors, unilateral or bilateral presentation, character of discharge, recent exposure to an infected individual, trauma (mechanical, chemical, ultraviolet), recent surgery, mucus fishing behavior, contact lens wear (lens type, hygiene, and use regimen), symptoms and signs potentially related to systemic diseases, allergy, asthma, eczema, and use of topical and systemic medications; the ocular history includes details about previous episodes of conjunctivitis, concomitant ocular surface diseases, and previous ophthalmic surgery; the medical history considers compromised immune status (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus [HIV], chemotherapy, immunosuppressants) and current or prior systemic diseases (e.g., atopy, SJS /TEN, carcinoma, leukemia, chicken pox, GVHD), vaccination history; the social history should include smoking habits, exposure to second-hand smoke, occupation and hobbies, exposure to air pollutants, travel, exercise habits, diet, sexual activity, and use of illicit drugs.

Case presentation

History

A 4-year-old white Irish fraternal twin boy was referred to the paediatric service from the community with a history of:
3 weeks of recurrent tonsillitis, coryza and dry cough for;
2 weeks of painless blistering lesions on hands, feet and mouth (with or without fever);
4 days of documented relapsing and remitting fever 39°C in the setting of decreased oral intake.

Of note, his twin sister was hospitalised with similar symptoms for 24 hours prior to the patient and then discharged home. Neither child had vomiting, diarrhoea, meningeal signs, mucositis or strawberry tongue during illness.

Prior medical history

The patient was well prior to admission, up to date with all vaccinations, had no allergies and took no regular medications other than paracetamol and amoxicillin prescribed in the community.

His obstetric, birth history and neonatal course was unremarkable except for an in vitro fertilisation assisted twin pregnancy and C-section for breech presentation at term. His development to date is normal.

Examination at admission was of an afebrile, alert, oriented 4-year-old boy in no acute distress. He weighed 14.7 kg. All other vital signs were within normal parameters for a child of his age.

Examination of the respiratory, cardiovascular and gastrointestinal systems was unremarkable. Examination of the eyes, ears, nose and throat revealed no bulbar conjunctival injection, a right erythematous tympanic membrane, erythematous, congested nasal mucosa and erythematous, inflamed pharyngeal tonsils without exudate.

Musculoskeletal survey and review of systems were also unremarkable.

Intermittent irritability, lethargy and fevers (38°C–39°C) continued for 24 hours after admission. A faint abdominal exanthem and bilateral uniquely cervical lymphadenopathy in addition to erythematous oral mucosa and scattered lower respiratory crepitations were noted at this time.

### Does this patient with acute infectious conjunctivitis have a bacterial infection? the rational clinical examination systematic review [^112ByJSW]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Acute infectious conjunctivitis is characterized by ocular redness and discharge, and is a common clinical entity. Evidence-based tools to aid the clinical diagnosis of viral vs bacterial conjunctivitis are lacking and may contribute to overprescribing of topical antibiotics.

Objective

To determine the relative prevalence of viral vs bacterial conjunctivitis in adults and children, and to determine which symptoms or signs are suggestive of a viral vs bacterial etiology.

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search (January 1946-March 2022) yielded 1891 articles. Included articles were rated using a quality score based on a modified Rational Clinical Examination grading system. Methodological quality levels 1 through 4 required a microbiological reference standard for diagnosis, whereas quality level 5 (the lowest quality) used a clinical reference standard for diagnosis.

Study Selection

Consecutive series of patients presenting with acute infectious conjunctivitis and case series of viral or bacterial conjunctivitis alone. Thirty-two studies were included in a meta-analysis to determine prevalence and diagnostic accuracy measures; 27 used a microbiological reference standard for diagnosis and 5 used a clinical reference standard for diagnosis.

Results

In studies involving children (5 studies; 881 patients; mean age, 4.7 years [age range, 1 month-18 years]), the prevalence of bacterial conjunctivitis was higher than viral conjunctivitis (71% vs 16%, respectively, P = 0.01). In the only study of adults (n = 207 patients; mean age, 25.7 years), the prevalence of viral conjunctivitis was higher than bacterial conjunctivitis (78% vs 16%, respectively, P < .001). For the primary analysis of level 1 (n = 6) and level 2 (n = 5) studies (1725 patients total), the clinical findings that best distinguished a viral etiology for conjunctivitis from a bacterial etiology included pharyngitis (sensitivity range, 0.55–0.58; specificity range, 0.89–0.94; positive likelihood ratio [LR] range, 5.4–9.9), preauricular lymphadenopathy (sensitivity range, 0.17–0.31; specificity range, 0.93–0.94; positive LR range, 2.5–5.6), and contact with another person with red eye (sensitivity, 0.18 [95% CI, 0.14–0.22]; specificity, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.90–0.95]; positive LR, 2.5 [95% CI, 1.6–3.7]). Mucopurulent ocular discharge (sensitivity, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.60–0.87); specificity, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.58–0.73]; positive LR, 2.1 [95% CI, 1.7–2.6]) and otitis media (sensitivity, 0.24 [95% CI, 0.20–0.29]; specificity, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.85–0.94]; positive LR, 2.5 [95% CI, 1.5–4.4]) were associated with the presence of bacterial conjunctivitis.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this review, bacterial conjunctivitis was more common than viral conjunctivitis in children and viral conjunctivitis was more common than bacterial conjunctivitis in adults, although the prevalence estimates were based on limited evidence. Symptoms and signs associated with a higher likelihood of viral conjunctivitis in adults and children included concomitant pharyngitis, an enlarged preauricular node, and contact with another person with red eye, and signs associated with a higher likelihood of bacterial conjunctivitis included the presence of mucopurulent discharge and otitis media, but no single symptom or sign differentiated the 2 conditions with high certainty.

### Comprehensive detection and serotyping of human adenoviruses by PCR and sequencing [^112nmVA2]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2004). Low credibility.

Human adenoviruses are common pathogens associated with many diseases, including respiratory, gastrointestinal, and ocular infections. Because they are now being increasingly recognized as agents of life-threatening disseminated infection in immunocompromised patients, robust and sensitive laboratory detection methods are needed for their rapid diagnosis. We describe here a PCR assay using a single primer pair, targeting a region of the hexon gene containing hypervariable region 7, that can detect all known human adenovirus serotypes and allows for serotype determination through the analysis of the nucleotide sequence. This comprehensive assay has proven effective for diagnosing adenoviruses at the serotype level in a broad range of patient specimens, including conjunctival, nasopharyngeal, stool, blood, and urine specimens.

### COVID-19 and the eye [^114ze9qd]. Clinics in Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

There is growing literature describing the ocular manifestations of COVID-19. We have assessed published reviews, cross-sectional analyses, and clinical reports to summarize the ocular manifestations of the disease and available vaccines, identify the potential role of ocular transmission, and offer basic clinical guidance to health care providers. Ultimately, self-limiting conjunctivitis and conjunctival hyperemia are the most frequently reported ocular findings; several rarer entities may warrant targeted topical therapies. COVID-19 vaccines have been infrequently associated with the development of rare but significant side effects that may warrant ophthalmologist referral as well as specific treatments. Despite the overall low risk of ocular transmission, eye protection is advisable for health care providers in high-risk scenarios. This review should help to guide the assessment of patients with eye complaints in the setting of COVID-19 to promote appropriate diagnosis, treatment, monitoring, and referral.

### 2017 Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of infectious diarrhea [^117NPL7v]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Infectious diarrhea — empiric antimicrobial therapy for acute and persistent watery diarrhea is generally discouraged: in most people with acute watery diarrhea and without recent international travel, empiric antimicrobial therapy is not recommended (strong, low), with an exception that may be made in people who are ill-appearing, and empiric treatment should be avoided in people with persistent watery diarrhea lasting 14 days or more (strong, low). Asymptomatic contacts of people with acute or persistent watery diarrhea should not be offered empiric or preventive therapy, but should be advised to follow appropriate infection prevention and control measures (strong, moderate). Features suggesting inflammatory infection that warrant investigation include high fever, significant abdominal pain, and duration > 3 days, and given the relatively small benefit of empiric treatment (1 day shorter illness on average) and the likelihood of viral infection in the absence of inflammatory signs, empiric treatment cannot be recommended and may be potentially harmful.

### Evaluation and management of infants and young… [^113uhQDd]. AAFP (2001). Low credibility.

Acute febrile illness in an infant or a young child is a common clinical scenario that can be a diagnostic challenge. The evaluation is guided by the history and physical examination, along with judiciously selected screening tests. The overwhelming majority of nontoxic but febrile infants and young children have a viral infection. The physician's primary task is to identify the infant or child who is at risk for serious bacterial infection. Special Situations TOXIC APPEARANCE Toxic-appearing infants and children are pale or cyanotic, lethargic or inconsolably irritable. In addition, they may have tachypnea and tachycardia with poor capillary refill. A variety of conditions other than infection may result in a toxic appearance. In all instances, immediate resuscitation is warranted, appropriate diagnostic studies and cultures should be obtained, and empiric antibiotic therapy should be administered unless a condition other than sepsis is immediately identified.
2.

VIRAL OR BACTERIAL INFECTION Viral infection is the cause of fever in most infants and young children. With stomatitis, varicella or another readily identified exanthem, the cause of the fever may be readily apparent on physical examination, and further diagnostic evaluation may not be required. 3 If a focal bacterial infection such as pneumonia, meningitis or osteomyelitis is suspected, efforts should be made to identify the specific infection and initiate appropriate treatment. CHRONIC ILLNESSES Infants and children with fever who have known chronic illnesses that affect immune status may require more aggressive evaluation and management than children without such conditions. 4 found that 32 percent of children two years of age and younger with meningitis had been given oral antibiotics for more than two days before the meningitis was detected.

These children tended to be less ill-appearing, more commonly had upper respiratory findings and were less apt to manifest fever. Physicians must always bear in mind the possibility of partially treated meningitis when they are evaluating febrile infants and young children who have recently been prescribed antibiotics. Initial Approach to Infants and Young Children with Fever URINARY TRACT INFECTION Urinary tract infection remains a significant risk in well-appearing but febrile infants and young children. The probability of urinary tract infection varies with age, with the greatest incidence in infants younger than six months. Up to 20 percent of febrile young infants have been reported to have positive urine cultures.

A recent practice parameter on urinary tract infection recommended that urine be collected for culture by catheterization or suprapubic aspiration in all infants and children two months to two years of age with unexplained fever if empiric antibiotic treatment had been prescribed. PNEUMONIA, OTITIS MEDIA AND ENTERITIS The incidence of bacteremia does not differ significantly in febrile infants and young children with or without otitis media. 14, 15 Therefore, most authorities advise that otitis media not be considered a cause of fever and recommend that febrile infants and children with otitis media be evaluated for an occult infection. Stool culture is recommended only in febrile infants and children who have diarrhea.

1. 19 Fever and Risk of Serious Bacterial Infection YOUNG INFANTS Approximately 10 percent of well-appearing young infants with a temperature higher than 38°C harbor a serious bacterial infection or meningitis.

### Conjunctivitis: a systematic review of diagnosis and treatment [^1138Wf4y]. JAMA (2013). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on infectious conjunctivitis:

- **Definition**: Infectious conjunctivitis is the inflammation of the conjunctiva caused by bacterial, viral, or fungal pathogens.
- **Pathophysiology**: Viruses account for 80% of all cases of acute conjunctivitis, with most cases caused by adenoviruses. Other viral causes include HSV, VZV, EBV, influenza, enterovirus, and coxsackievirus. Bacterial conjunctivitis is commonly caused by S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, and H. influenzae. Ophthalmia neonatorum is typically caused by C. trachomatis or N. gonorrhoeae. Fungal conjunctivitis is rare and usually occurs in immunocompromised patients.
- **Epidemiology**: It is estimated that approximately 6 million cases of acute conjunctivitis occur annually in the US.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors include close contact with infected individuals, poor hand hygiene, use of contaminated contact lenses, and exposure to contaminated water.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, infectious conjunctivitis presents with redness, itching, tearing, discharge, and crusting. Bacterial conjunctivitis often presents with purulent discharge, while viral conjunctivitis usually has a watery discharge and may be associated with upper respiratory tract infection symptoms. Fungal conjunctivitis may present with chronic, indolent symptoms.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Most cases of infectious conjunctivitis are self-limiting, lasting 1–2 weeks. Mild bacterial conjunctivitis typically resolves spontaneously without specific treatment in immunocompetent adults.

### A review of the differential diagnosis of acute infectious conjunctivitis: implications for treatment and management [^117SpSi8]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The diagnosis of acute infectious conjunctivitis can be difficult. Clinical ambiguity exists between the acute viral and bacterial as well as the allergic forms, which can confound diagnosis. Also, discrimination between viral or bacterial origins of infectious conjunctivitis based on historical, nonspecific, clinical signs and symptoms contributes to a high rate of misdiagnosis and overuse of antibiotic treatment. Therefore, in order to effectively treat acute infectious conjunctivitis, physicians must be aware of the clinical signs and symptoms and available diagnostic tests that can provide a more accurate differential diagnosis.

IDSA infectious diarrhea — prevention and management notes that avoiding dehydration by ensuring adequate fluid and electrolyte intake for replacement and maintenance is the mainstay of diarrheal illness management. People with diarrhea should refrain from recreational water activities, food preparation or service, and sexual activities while symptomatic. Increasing resistance to antimicrobial agents and risk of worsening illness (such as diarrhea associated with C. difficile) can result from antimicrobial and antimotility drug use and highlight the need for appropriate use of these interventions. The burden of acute gastroenteritis has been reduced since implementation of 2 US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–licensed rotavirus vaccines, recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) in 2006 and 2008, and clinically significant disease and hospitalization and office visits have been decreased in infants who have received a rotavirus vaccine as well as in adults through community protection.

### How to use… eye swabs [^1137L4Se]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2015). Low credibility.

Conjunctivitis is a very common presentation to general practitioners and general paediatricians. The investigation of conjunctivitis can be a significant cost to microbiology laboratories due to the high volume of samples that can be submitted, particularly from patients in the community. The key issue is to send eye swabs in clinical situations where it can make a difference to management, and limiting the use of eye swabs in routine cases of conjunctivitis which are likely to be due to viruses. For investigation of neonatal conjunctivitis we recommend sending a bacterial swab for routine culture, and also a swab for molecular detection of Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. In older children with mild conjunctivitis no swab is necessary unless there is marked conjunctival injection. In this article we also highlight patient populations that require specialist tests to be sent as part of their assessment such as contact lens wearers and sexually active teenagers.

### Conjunctivitis preferred practice pattern [^112Etouf]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Conjunctivitis Preferred Practice Pattern — Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2)/Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19) conjunctivitis more often presents with unilateral than bilateral conjunctival injection, with a typical follicular reaction that may include chemosis, watery discharge, superficial keratitis, and pseudomembranes. Associated factors include SARS‑CoV‑2 exposure, unprotected eye exposure, significant travel history, or respiratory symptoms. The natural history is that it usually occurs early in disease with mild inflammation and disappearance of symptoms within a few days of treatment, has relatively low incidence/prevalence compared with other systemic manifestations and is more common in children, and may be isolated or associated with systemic symptoms. Potential sequelae are that conjunctival symptoms appear self‑limited with variable duration (5–21 days), and typically there is no effect on visual acuity and no short‑term complications.

### Chikungunya in children: a clinical review [^112ZoCy2]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2018). Low credibility.

Chikungunya (CHIKV) is an emerging arboviral infection with recent spikes in transmission in the Americas. Chikungunya is most commonly transmitted by mosquitos, specifically Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. These mosquitoes are found throughout many parts of the United States. The classic tetrad of symptoms for CHIKV is fever, symmetric polyarthralgia, maculopapular rash, and nonpurulent conjunctivitis. Although the majority (3 of 4) of infected people will be symptomatic, the viral illness generally runs a benign course. Nevertheless, when compared with infected adults, children more commonly have neurological and dermatological symptoms and are less likely to have arthralgia. The key differential diagnosis to consider is dengue, which has greater immediate morbidity and which can cause coinfection. Local health departments facilitate diagnostic testing, using either RNA polymerase chain reaction or antibody screening based on the timing of presentation. Management is supportive. The purpose of this review article is to provide readers basic knowledge regarding the microbiology, epidemiology, risk factors for transmission, and typical clinical presentation of CHIKV. A practical approach to diagnosis and management of infected children is provided.

Associated factors include unvaccinated individuals, and both rash and conjunctivitis are caused by immune-mediated clearance of measles virus-infected cells and may be absent in immunodeficient patients. Natural history includes fever and maculopapular rash followed by cough, coryza (or rhinitis) and/or conjunctivitis; while conjunctivitis develops at the prodromal phase, keratitis (photophobia) may develop before the development of rash. A potential sequela noted is blindness from corneal scarring in vitamin A-deficient children.

### Deep sequencing analysis of clinical samples from patients with acute infectious conjunctivitis during the COVID-19 delta surge in madurai, India [^1149qJqb]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Seasonal outbreaks of infectious conjunctivitis remain a public health issue. Determination of outbreak etiologies in the context of a worldwide pandemic may provide useful information to guide public health strategies. The aim of this study was to identify pathogens associated with outpatient infectious conjunctivitis during the COVID-19 Delta surge.

Methods

This prospective study was conducted from April 2021 to September 2021. All outpatients presenting to the Aravind Eye Center (Madurai, India) with signs and symptoms consistent with acute infectious conjunctivitis were eligible. Three swabs were obtained from each participant: one from each conjunctiva and one from the anterior nares. Samples were processed for metagenomic RNA deep sequencing (RNA-seq).

Results

Samples from 106 study participants were sequenced. The most common presenting symptoms were tearing (86%) and itching (71%). Preauricular lymphadenopathy was present in 38% of participants. 20% of participants had close contacts with similar symptoms. Systemic symptoms such as coughing, runny nose, vomiting or diarrhea were uncommonly reported. 60% of all participants used some medicated eye drops upon enrollment. 75% of study participants demonstrated infection with human adenovirus D (HAdV-D). 11% of conjunctivitis was associated with SARS-CoV-2. 15% had no definitive pathogen detected. 8% of all participants had codetection of more than one pathogen on RNA-seq.

Conclusions

During the COVID-19 Delta surge in India, HAdV-D was the most common pathogen associated with infectious conjunctivitis. SARS-CoV-2 was the second most common associated pathogen. Seasonal surveillance may be necessary for the determination of emerging and reemerging pathogens responsible for infectious conjunctivitis.

### Severe recurrence of reactive infectious mucocutaneous eruption with extensive ocular involvement in an adult due to SARS-CoV-2 [^114p1ASC]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 40-year-old man presented to the emergency department with bilateral conjunctival injection and associated purulent discharge, painful oral erosions, vesiculobullous rash, and fever to 103.5 F. Two weeks prior, he antigen-tested positive for COVID-19 and had 4 days of upper respiratory symptoms that self-resolved. Given the severity of presentation and his inability to maintain adequate oral intake, the patient was admitted for further evaluation and management.

This was the fourth and most severe flare of a mucocutaneous eruption dating back 2 years. Each episode had similar findings, including bilateral conjunctival injection 1 week prior to the development of painful lip and mouth erosions. Cutaneous findings were limited in prior episodes, with papules on the distal extremities and no involvement of the genitalia. These prior episodes resolved without a cause identified and did not require treatment with systemic medications.

On examination, the patient had scattered erythematous papulovesicular lesions on his trunk and extremities (Fig 1, A–E). Lesions were predominantly clustered around the hands and feet and mixed with a few bullae. Erosions and hemorrhagic crusting were noted in the oropharynx, tongue, and lips. No lymphadenopathy was appreciated. Ophthalmic examination revealed scant mucoid discharge, significant bilateral inferior conjunctival injection, and large confluent areas of inferior conjunctival ulceration, but no symblephara formation. The remainder of the patient's ocular anterior and posterior segment was unremarkable.

Case 3

A 5-year-old female presented to our emergency room with pain, tearing, and photophobia in bilateral eyes for 1 week. She had a common cold with cough and sputum a week earlier followed by red eyes and watery discharge. Some of her kindergarten schoolmates also had red eyes during the same period. Severe papillary congestion with patchy subconjunctival hemorrhage (SCH) in the conjunctivae, and an epithelial defect on the cornea of her right eye were found (Figure 3A). Her left eye showed mild papillary congestion with some punctate keratitis.

She was treated with combined antibiotics/steroids and lubricants, and the large epithelial defect started to heal after 3 days (Figure 3B).

### Evaluation and management of illness in a child after international travel [^116xjH2L]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2005). Low credibility.

International travel by children is becoming increasingly common over the last few decades. As a result, clinicians may be asked to assist in the evaluation and treatment of an ill child after international travel. Along with recording the typical thorough history of present illness and medical history, the physician who cares for a child in this situation will have to take a thorough travel history and consider not only local conditions, but also possible pathogens that the child may have encountered during the journey. A detailed travel history should be routinely performed to investigate specific exposures. Reference materials are available that can guide the clinician in determining which infectious agents are endemic to various areas of the world. With the exception of obtaining a basic laboratory screen, further evaluation of the young patient should be dictated by the most likely cause of the illness. Repeated testing and examinations and close follow-up may be necessary to arrive at the proper diagnosis and initiate appropriate treatment in a timely manner.

### Tularemia in pregnant woman, serbia, 2018 [^116r3YgH]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Tularemia is a systemic, potentially serious zoonotic disease caused by Francisella tularensis bacteria. Interhuman transmission of tularemia has not been reported. Transmission is primarily by Ixodidae ticks; the second most frequent vectors are mosquitoes in restricted areas (e.g. Sweden and Finland). Contact with live infected animals can be a source of human infection. Many tularemia cases also occur through contact with contaminated aquatic environments (e.g. swimming, canyoning, fishing). Incubation period is 1–10 days, and clinical signs depend on the route of infection. Direct contact with animals or tick bites leads to a skin lesion with satellite lymphadenopathy. Ingesting contaminated food or drinking contaminated water leads to pharyngitis and cervical lymphadenopathy. Clinical signs are ulceroglandular disease with cutaneous ulcerations and marked lymphadenopathy; glandular disease with no ulcers but marked lymphadenopathy; oculoglandular disease with preauricular lymphadenopathy and conjunctivitis; oropharyngeal disease with pharyngitis and cervical lymphadenopathy; gastrointestinal disease with vomiting, abdominal discomfort, and diarrhea; respiratory disease (pneumonia or pleuritis); and typhoid tularemia (fever without early signs/symptoms). If not treated adequately, tularemia can spread to the lungs, pleura, gastrointestinal tract, or central nervous system.

There are 2 subspecies of F. tularensis: type A, which is almost completely restricted to North America, and type B, which is found in Europe. Type A strains are highly virulent. Before the advent of effective antimicrobial drugs, mortality rate for both types was 5%–10%. Current mortality rates are 2%–3% for type A and < 1% for type B tularemia but vary according to type of infection and F. tularensis genotype. Mortality rates among patients with bilateral type A acute pneumonia are > 30%.

After 2000, the annual incidence rate of tularemia in Europe was highest in Kosovo (> 5 cases/100,000 population), followed by Sweden, Finland, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Norway, Serbia, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Croatia. Tularemia is more common in men than in women and extremely rare in pregnant women. To date, at least 12 cases of tularemia during pregnancy have been described in the literature (Appendix). We report the case of a pregnant woman with tularemia in Serbia.

### Conjunctivitis preferred practice pattern [^115oa6Gz]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Conjunctivitis PPP — herpes simplex virus (HSV) conjunctivitis is usually unilateral and can be bilateral, especially in atopic, pediatric, or immunocompromised patients, with bulbar conjunctival injection, watery discharge, mild follicular reaction of conjunctiva, and a palpable preauricular node; distinctive signs include vesicular rash or ulceration of eyelids, pleomorphic or excavated dendritic epithelial keratitis of cornea, and ulceration of the conjunctiva. Associated/predisposing factors include prior infection with HSV with triggers for reactivation such as stress, other acute viral or febrile illnesses, ultraviolet exposure, surgery, or trauma, and primary HSV infection with exposure to an infected individual. Natural history is that it usually subsides without treatment within 4 to 7 days unless complications occur. Potential sequelae include blepharitis, epithelial keratitis, corneal edema, endotheliitis, stromal keratitis, neovascularization, scarring, thinning, perforation, uveitis, trabeculitis, and retinitis.

### Pediatric fever [^1124saku]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Pediatric fever is a common complaint in children. The most common cause is self-limited viral infection. However, neonates and young infants are evaluated and treated differently than older, vaccinated, and clinically evaluable children. Neonates should be admitted to the hospital, young infants in the second month of life may be risk stratified, and those deemed low risk on testing may be sent home with close follow-up. Children older than 2 months may be evaluated clinically for signs of bacterial infection that require intervention. Urinary tract infections cause more than 90% of serious bacterial illness in children, and younger children have a higher incidence of infection.

### Conjunctivitis: diagnosis and management [^114ZswsT]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Conjunctivitis caused by viruses, bacteria, or allergies is one of the most common eye conditions in primary care. There is no single sign or symptom that accurately differentiates viral from bacterial conjunctivitis. A comprehensive history and physical examination can guide diagnosis. Viral and allergic conjunctivitis are more common in adults and typically present with watery discharge. Supportive care options for viral conjunctivitis include artificial tears, cold compresses, and antihistamine eye drops. Strict personal hygiene, including frequent handwashing, is essential to decrease the risk of transmission. Topical antihistamines with mast cell-stabilizing activity are the treatment of choice for allergic conjunctivitis. Bacterial conjunctivitis is more common in children and typically presents as mucopurulent discharge with the eyelids matted shut. Delayed antibiotic prescribing has been found to have similar symptom control as immediate prescribing. Ophthalmology referral is indicated for conjunctivitis in a neonate or patients with severe pain, decreased vision, recent ocular surgery, vesicular rash on the eyelids or nose, history of rheumatologic disease, or immunocompromised state.

Medication history will also be informative. For example, anticoagulants are associated with subconjunctival hemorrhage, and topiramate is associated with angle-closure glaucoma. Patients requiring steroids may be at risk of more severe disease or other pathology, and referral to an eye care provider is recommended. The clinical examination should also include an assessment of the lymph nodes (swollen submandibular and preauricular lymph nodes). Lymphadenopathy, such as an enlarged, tender preauricular lymph node, is more common in viral versus bacterial conjunctivitis.

The physical eye examination should inspect for visual acuity, discharge type, corneal opacity, abnormal pupil size or shape, eyelid swelling, and orbit protrusion or asymmetry. Referral to an ophthalmologist or eye care professional should be performed immediately for cases that involve visual loss, moderate to severe pain, severe purulent discharge, or any corneal involvement. Useful information can be obtained with a simple penlight in the absence of a slit lamp, especially as it pertains to measurement of the anterior chamber depth and the ruling out of angle closure. Viral conjunctivitis can vary in presentation, but tearing, clear to white discharge, redness, and bilaterality are very common. Viral conjunctivitis usually starts with one eye, with the second eye to follow within a few days. Bacterial conjunctivitis is strongly suggested by glued eyelids, lack of itching, and lack of history of conjunctivitis. A diagnostic index for bacterial conjunctivitis by van Weert et al suggests that younger adult patients with conjunctivitis who present without glued eyelids at awakening are less likely to have conjunctivitis with a bacterial origin; this risk increases with age and presentation of two glued eyes.

A slit lamp provides a more detailed appearance of the conjunctival epithelium that enables differentiation between various types of conjunctival inflammation (follicular, mainly infectious; papillary, mainly allergic; pseudomembranous, severe EKC; eosinophilic, allergic). Fluorescein staining in conjunction with slit lamp examination, highlights patterns of corneal fluorescein uptake and exposes anterior chamber inflammation.HSV infection typically appears as branching lesions with intensely stained end bulbs, while highly branched lesions without end bulbs are typical of VZV infection.

### Conjunctivitis preferred practice pattern [^112re41U]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Conjunctivitis Preferred Practice Pattern — Parinaud oculoglandular syndrome is characterized by unilateral granulomatous follicular palpebral or bulbar conjunctivitis with associated ipsilateral regional (preauricular and submandibular) lymphadenopathy, fever, eyelid swelling, conjunctival granulomas, conjunctival injection, chemosis, and serous discharge. It is most commonly in cat scratch disease (Bartonella henselae), tularemia (Francisella tularensis), and sporotrichosis and is also reported with various bacterial, fungal, mycobacterial, and viral infections. Natural history includes follicular conjunctivitis with lymphadenopathy that can be concomitant or delayed by several weeks, may be self-limited with Bartonella with improvement over a few weeks with antimicrobials that may hasten resolution, and tularemia-associated disease may be more challenging to diagnose but usually responds to antibiotics. Potential sequelae include neuroretinitis, vitritis, and ptosis, long-term sequelae are rare, and corneal perforation has been reported with Yersinia enterocolitica and C. trachomatis.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

TB disease — diagnosis and imaging in HIV-exposed and HIV-infected children emphasizes that the most rigorous diagnosis of TB requires culture confirmation. In clinical practice, a diagnosis of TB in children frequently depends on a combination of TB exposure or infection, symptoms and clinical signs with chest imaging studies; where EPTB is suspected, histopathology and other laboratory results may aid diagnosis. Chest radiography should include both posteroanterior (or anteroposterior) and lateral views for optimal assessment of hilar adenopathy; in cases of uncertainty, ongoing symptom review and repeat radiography in 1 to 2 weeks may be highly informative. All children diagnosed with TB should be tested for HIV infection (AIII).

A 7-year-old boy presented to the emergency department with fever, cough, congestion, abdominal pain, myalgias, and morbilliform rash. Several aspects of the patient's history, including recent travel, living on a farm, exposure to sick contacts, and new medications, resulted in a wide differential diagnosis. Initial laboratory testing revealed leukocytosis with neutrophilia and elevated atypical lymphocytes, but did not reveal any infectious causes of illness. He was discharged from the hospital, but then represented to the emergency department a day later with worsening rash, continued fever, abdominal pain, and poor intake. He was then admitted. A more comprehensive laboratory evaluation was initiated. During this hospital course, the patient's physical examination changed when he developed head and neck edema, and certain laboratory trends became clearer. With the assistance of several specialists, the team was able to reach a more definitive diagnosis and initiate treatment to appropriately manage his condition.

### The global enteric multicenter study (GEMS) of diarrheal disease in infants and young children in developing countries: epidemiologic and clinical methods of the case / control study [^111n52Xi]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Case Definition of MSD and Other Study Outcomes

The initial step in eligibility screening was the selection of children who fulfilled the WHO definition of diarrhea (≥ 3 abnormally loose stools in 24 hours). In subsequent steps we identified cases of MSD, the primary outcome of interest, intending to capture diarrheal illnesses that would not be expected to resolve spontaneously without medical intervention or without sequelae, because these illnesses constitute priorities for development of vaccines and other new or improved preventive and therapeutic strategies. We reasoned that episodes that would qualify as MSD fell into 2 general categories: (1) those accompanied by dehydration to a degree that the child's survival would likely depend on access to life-saving rehydration fluids, and (2) those with evidence of inflammatory destruction of the intestinal mucosa, thereby at increased risk for disabling sequelae (such as persistent diarrhea and stunting) or death.

To capture children who had potentially life-threatening diarrheal dehydration, we adapted the WHO definition of dehydration to our case definition of MSD, choosing the most objective signs (sunken eyes more than usual and slow or very slow recoil after an abdominal wall "skin pinch"). In addition, we included the determination by a healthcare provider that the severity of dehydration warranted administration of intravenous fluids. Although not part of our case definition, other signs of dehydration proposed by WHO were documented, including restlessness or irritability and drinking eagerly or appearing thirsty (considered to be signs of "some" dehydration), and lethargy, loss of consciousness, inability to drink, or drinking poorly (as signs of "severe" dehydration). During analysis we will explore the impact on the study findings of including these other signs of dehydration in the definition of MSD. We considered adopting as inclusion criteria elements of systems used widely to define severe illness in rotavirus vaccine trials. However, many of the components, such as total duration and maximum severity of diarrhea, vomiting, and fever, can only be determined in retrospect when the episode is resolving or resolved, at which point the decision to include a child in GEMS would already have been made. Instead, our approach has been to collect this information for exploration during analysis.

A detailed history revealed she had been in close contact with newborn kittens at home and biopsy of the granuloma demonstrated Bartonella species, confirming the diagnosis of cat scratch disease. The child received a course of appropriate oral and topical antibiotics and steroids. Unfortunately eyesight in the right eye remains poor on follow-up.

### A review of the differential diagnosis of acute infectious conjunctivitis: implications for treatment and management [^112Q6fN6]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Chlamydia is the cause of 1.8–5.6% of all acute conjunctivitis cases. Chlamydial conjunctivitis primarily has a unilateral presentation with concurrent genital infectionand presents with conjunctival redness, lymphoid follicle formation, or mild purulent discharge. A distinctive sign of this infection in adults is bulbar conjunctival follicles, which are absent in neonates/infants. Chlamydial conjunctivitis is typically spread through sexual contact. Chlamydia is the most common sexually transmitted disease in the United States, with 1,708,569 cases reported in 2017. From 2013 to 2017, the number of reported cases of chlamydia in the United States increased by 22%. In neonates, the eyes can be infected after vaginal delivery by infected mothers. Treatment includes oral azithromycin or oral doxycycline in adults, and erythromycin in neonates.

Allergic Conjunctivitis

Most cases of allergic conjunctivitis are attributable to seasonal allergies and present with bilateral symptoms. Mild to severe itching and redness are the key symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis, which can present with a watery or mucoid discharge. Treatment includes supportive measures (cold compress, artificial tears), topical or oral antihistamines, and mast cell inhibitors. A short course of topical corticosteroids can be used in select cases in which corneal involvement and herpetic infection have been ruled out; both conditions could worsen with steroid use.

Differential Diagnosis

To satisfy the American Academy of Ophthalmology Preferred Practice Pattern guidelines that treatment of conjunctivitis is directed at the root cause, physicians should manage patients by taking a systematic approach (Figure 2), considering the epidemiologic spectrum of infectious conjunctivitis, patient history, clinical exam, and — if needed — diagnostic tests.

He was commenced on empiric intravenous ceftriaxone, as well as supplemental oxygen and nasogastric rehydration. He continued to have spiking fevers after five days of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. Serial clinical examinations demonstrated a desquamating perineal rash, peri-oral changes, and cervical lymphadenopathy.

Together with a history of bilateral conjunctival redness prior to hospitalization, these features formed the basis for a likely diagnosis of KD. There were also features of MAS (bicytopenia, hyperferritinaemia, hypertriglyceridaemia, elevated transaminases).

Echocardiography demonstrated dilatation of the left anterior descending coronary artery, (diameter 2.0 mm; Z-score 2.9), and a small pericardial effusion. The child received IVIG 2 g/kg over 12 h on the seventh day of admission, which was followed by defervescence and improvement in serum ferritin and platelet count. He was also commenced on intravenous methylprednisolone 2 mg/kg/day and aspirin 30 mg/kg/day in four divided doses.

On the ninth day of admission he developed progressive respiratory distress and new foci of patchy consolidation on chest radiograph (Fig. 8), but remained afebrile.

Fig. 8

Repeat inflammatory markers demonstrated rising CRP and white cell count, but downward-trending serum ferritin. He required escalation to high-flow nasal cannula oxygen and started second-line antibiotic therapy for presumed hospital-acquired pneumonia with piperacillin-tazobactam and amikacin. Methylprednisolone was discontinued after two days due to a concern of immunosuppression. Repeat blood culture was negative. Clinical improvement was seen with empiric second-line antibiotic and supportive therapy, and he was gradually weaned to room air. Repeat echocardiography demonstrated normal coronary arteries. He was discharged on aspirin 5 mg/kg/day after 15 days in hospital. He was seen for follow-up two weeks later and was noted to be clinically well with low inflammatory markers, recovering anaemia, and rebound thrombocytosis. Repeat echocardiography after six weeks confirmed resolution of the coronary aneurysm and aspirin was discontinued.

### Conjunctivitis preferred practice pattern [^111hyMyU]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Conjunctivitis Preferred Practice Pattern — Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) conjunctivitis presents with follicular conjunctivitis that is typically unilateral with ipsilateral lymphadenopathy; it can have hemorrhagic conjunctivitis with subconjunctival hemorrhage and periorbital edema, a conjunctival nodule is an uncommon finding, and systemic signs include generalized fatigue, fever, pharyngitis, lymphadenopathy, and splenomegaly. Follicular conjunctivitis is the most common ocular disease during acute EBV infection, and other major causes of nonadenoviral acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis are enterovirus 70 and coxsackievirus A24. The natural history is often self-limiting and can present as oculoglandular syndrome. Potential sequelae include dry eye syndrome, dacryoadenitis, episcleritis, keratitis, uveitis, choroiditis, retinitis, retinal vasculitis, papillitis, and ophthalmoplegia.

The 81 EV-positive samples included 52 from conjunctival samples (64.20%), 28 from corneal samples (34.50%), and 1 from an aqueous sample (1.23%). There were no positive vitreous samples. The mean patient age was 46.2 years (median 46; range 1–89 years) with a male-to-female ratio of 1.6:1.0. Similar to previous studies reporting on EV infections, conjunctivitis was the most common presentation. Forty-nine patients (60.50%) presented with conjunctivitis, whereas 30 patients (37.0%) presented with corneal signs (Table 1). Two patients initially presented with conjunctival injection and lid lesions or follicles but developed anterior uveitis at their subsequent follow-up visit. Seventy-two (88.9%) patients presented with unilateral signs; 9 patients presented with bilateral disease, including 1 patient with coinfection with Streptococcus pneumoniae, and 1 patient who was also adenovirus PCR positive. A history of systemic symptoms was not recorded routinely in the clinical notes. It is known that systemic EV infections may be asymptomatic or present with clinical manifestations comprising fever, exanthem, headache, respiratory illness, sore throat, myocarditis, vomiting, and diarrhea.

### Conjunctivitis preferred practice pattern [^112rQKH5]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Viral adenoviral conjunctivitis — clinical signs, exposures, course, and sequelae are outlined: Abrupt onset that may be unilateral or bilateral (often sequentially bilateral) with bulbar conjunctival injection, watery discharge, follicular reaction of inferior tarsal conjunctiva, chemosis, eyelid swelling, erythema, and can resemble orbital cellulitis on exam; distinctive signs include preauricular lymphadenopathy, petechial and subconjunctival hemorrhage, corneal epithelial defect, multifocal epithelial punctate keratitis evolving to anterior stromal keratitis, membrane/pseudomembrane formation, and eyelid ecchymosis. Associated/predisposing factors include exposure to infected individual (especially in school setting), concurrent upper respiratory infection, and recent ocular testing. The natural history is self-limited, with improvement of symptoms and signs within 5 to 14 days. Potential sequelae note that mild cases have none, whereas severe cases include conjunctival/subtarsal scarring, symblepharon, keratitis and dry eye, subepithelial corneal infiltrates from epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (EKC), corneal scarring, and lacrimal stenosis, and pseudomembranes are associated with higher rate of severe sequelae.

Case presentation

A previously healthy 19 month old boy presented with a 6 day history of fever accompanied by a diffuse macular erythematous rash that appeared 1 day after. The physical examination on admission revealed bilateral non-suppurative conjunctivitis, dry fissured and injected lips without "strawberry" tongue, diffuse macular rash on the trunk, face and limbs, swelling of the hands and feet, and right cervical lymphadenopathy (2 cm in diameter). Investigations revealed a total white blood count of 21 × 10⁹/L (neutrophils: 27.5%, lymphocytes: 58.4%, monocytes: 12.6%), hemoglobin: 11.9 g/dL, platelet count: 171 × 10⁹/L. The peripheral blood smear revealed atypical lymphocytes. Laboratory investigations also showed elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) 8.5 mg/dl (normal reference ≤ 0.5 mg/dl), hypoalbuminemia (3 g/dl) and elevated transaminase levels: alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 132 U/L, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) of 375 U/L. Urinalysis was normal. Chest X-ray revealed peri-bronchial thickening without infiltrate. Serology for EBV and Cytomegalovirus (CMV) was ordered. Because of high suspicion of KD, an abdominal ultrasonography and echocardiography were performed. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed hydrops of the gallbladder with patent biliary tracts, enlarged porta hepatis lymph nodes up to 8.4 mm in diameter and enlarged spleen 3.5X10.5 cm in diameter. Doppler Echocardiography was normal without any evidence of CAA. Following fulfillment of all the clinical criteria, the diagnosis of KD was made and treatment with IVIG 2 g/Kg was administered along with oral aspirin (80 mg/ kg/day). However, despite the treatment, he remained febrile for an additional 2 days with persistent clinical manifestations such as conjunctivitis, red fissured lips, "strawberry tongue", rash and peripheral edema; therefore he received a second 2 g/kg IVIG course with a favorable response. Repeated echocardiography on the fifth day from admission was normal. The patient was discharged after resolution of fever and improvement of inflammatory markers. The blood tests on discharge revealed CRP of 2.2 mg/dl, albumin of 2.93 g/dl, ALT of 258 U/L, ALP of 618 U/L, Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase (GGT) of 497 U/L. He remained afebrile for only 2 days. On the 14 day of illness the patient became febrile again and was readmitted. The physical examination revealed periungual desquamation of the fingertips and toes without the typical stigmata of KD he had prior. Blood examinations revealed remarkable leukocytosis up to 35.7 × 10⁹/L with 87.3% lymphocytes, hemoglobin of 11.2 g/L, platelets of 233X10 9 /L and CRP of 1.8 mg/dl. The blood smear revealed atypical lymphocytes and monocytes. The liver enzymes were still elevated, ferritin was 405 ng/ml (normal reference 7–142 ng/ml) and triglycerides were 223 mg/dl. The serology for infectious mononucleosis from his first admission revealed: IgM CMV (+), IgG CMV (−); IgM VCA EBV (+) IgG VCA EBV (−), IgG EBNA (−). Based on the clinical and laboratory manifestations, we conclude that the fever was attributed to the EBV infection rather than KD relapse and therefore he was not treated with a third dose of IVIG. To confirm infectious mononucleosis following the administration of 2 doses of IVIG, serum EBV PCR was performed and was positive (1.6 × 10³ cp/ml). Urinary CMV PCR was negative. The fever persisted for an additional 7 days. The patient was discharged with a low dose of aspirin. During the 3 months of follow-up, the patient remained completely asymptomatic and repeated echocardiograms were normal.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for febrile infant, more specifically with respect to general principles, AAFP 2020 guidelines recommend to obtain a diagnostic evaluation for febrile children between 28 days and 3 months of age, including a thorough history, physical examination, and urinalysis. Consider performing a lumbar puncture, but it is not suggested for all patients in this age range.
