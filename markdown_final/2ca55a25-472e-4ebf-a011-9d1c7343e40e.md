## Question

Interstitial lung disease mmf

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the role of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) in interstitial lung disease (ILD), including its efficacy, safety, guideline recommendations, and practical use. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the disease context and why MMF is biologically plausible. Then, I should appraise the highest-quality randomized evidence, especially SLS II and related analyses. Next, I will review meta-analytic data and observational cohorts to gauge consistency and generalizability. After that, I need to examine safety and tolerability, including teratogenicity and infection risk. Then, I should align conclusions with contemporary guidelines and expert consensus. Finally, I will translate this into practical prescribing, monitoring, and escalation strategies, while noting uncertainties and research gaps.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and mechanistic rationale. ILD comprises heterogeneous entities, with CTD-ILD (notably SSc-ILD) representing a substantial proportion. MMF inhibits inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, suppressing de novo purine synthesis in proliferating lymphocytes, which underpins its immunosuppressive and potentially antifibrotic effects in inflammatory-fibrotic lung disease, making it a rational option in CTD-ILD phenotypes [^113YjMYr] [^11319A8o].

> Now, I should review the pivotal randomized evidence. SLS II randomized 142 patients with symptomatic SSc-ILD to MMF for 24 months versus oral cyclophosphamide (CYC) for 12 months followed by placebo for 12 months; the primary endpoint (course of FVC % predicted over 24 months) showed no significant between-group difference, but both arms improved from baseline, with MMF achieving a mean FVC increase of about 2.19% and CYC about 2.88% over 24 months, indicating within-treatment benefit for both agents [^116hxBCT] [^114H54C9]. Wait, let me verify the interpretation: although the trial was technically negative for the between-arm comparison, the within-arm improvements are clinically meaningful and support disease-modifying activity of MMF in SSc-ILD [^114H54C9].

> Hold on, I should also examine indirect placebo comparisons. Post hoc analyses comparing MMF-treated participants in SLS II with placebo-treated participants in SLS I demonstrated significantly greater improvements in FVC, DLCO, mRSS, and dyspnea with MMF versus placebo after adjustment for baseline severity, reinforcing that MMF confers clinically relevant benefits relative to no active immunosuppression, albeit with the limitations of cross-trial comparisons [^112wsRPe].

> Next, I should review meta-analytic data across ILD etiologies. A 2024 systematic review and meta-analysis found no significant between-group advantage of MMF versus comparators for FVC or DLCO in RCTs, but secondary analyses showed small, statistically significant within-group improvements in FVC (~2.03%) and a signal for DLCO improvement in RCT subgroups (~4.42%), with very low certainty of evidence due to heterogeneity, small samples, and indirectness. This aligns with a conclusion that MMF may preserve function rather than clearly outperform comparators head-to-head [^112Gi4BK] [^1174iKir] [^116wZDXc].

> I will now examine observational cohorts to assess consistency. Multiple prospective and retrospective series in CTD-ILD (including SSc, myositis, and mixed CTD) report stabilization or modest improvement in FVC and/or DLCO with MMF, with low discontinuation rates and acceptable tolerability. For example, a large CTD-ILD cohort showed ~4.9% FVC improvement at 1 year and ~7.3% by 3 years, and SSc-specific cohorts demonstrate sustained stability over 24–36 months, supporting external validity despite nonrandomized designs [^114zaZXr] [^114FFiTm] [^112Y2bab].

> But wait, what about safety and tolerability relative to alternatives. In SLS II, MMF was better tolerated than CYC, with fewer premature withdrawals, fewer treatment failures, and substantially less hematologic toxicity (notably leukopenia and thrombocytopenia), supporting MMF's favorable risk–benefit profile in SSc-ILD. Broader safety data confirm gastrointestinal adverse effects, myelosuppression, and infection risk, and importantly, MMF is teratogenic and contraindicated in pregnancy, necessitating strict contraception and counseling [^116hxBCT] [^113F1U3R] [^111kY3jH] [^111zbQwY].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to ensure alignment. The 2024 ATS SSc-ILD guideline issues a strong recommendation for mycophenolate based on very low-quality evidence, reflecting consensus that benefits outweigh harms. BSR 2024 similarly recommends MMF as first-line therapy for SSc-ILD, and ACR/CHEST 2024 places MMF among preferred first-line options for SARD-associated ILD, with disease-specific hierarchies prioritizing MMF in SSc-ILD and myositis-ILD contexts [^113kUZYX] [^114XLjT7] [^115cuq9D].

> Let me consider special populations and phenotypes. In myositis-associated ILD, MMF is widely used and often effective, with retrospective data showing improved FVC trajectories and steroid-sparing effects. In RA-ILD, real-world cohorts suggest immunosuppression (including MMF) improves FVC and DLCO trajectories compared with pre-treatment slopes, though randomized data remain limited. For chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis, small retrospective series suggest MMF or azathioprine may improve DLCO, but prospective trials are needed before routine endorsement [^1177drKr] [^111gEaN3] [^114Gtg7b].

> I should double-check the role of antifibrotics and combination therapy. Nintedanib reduces FVC decline in SSc-ILD and is FDA-approved; subgroup analyses suggest the absolute effect size is smaller when background MMF is present, though relative treatment effects are similar, and guidelines suggest nintedanib as an add-on in progressive disease or when immunosuppression is contraindicated; evidence for pirfenidone plus MMF is limited and largely exploratory, prompting research recommendations rather than firm guidance [^116ExwFx] [^113kUZYX] [^114m7qbb].

> Now, I need to translate this into practical prescribing. Typical MMF dosing uses a target of 1.5–3 g/day of MMF in divided doses, with slower titration to mitigate GI effects. Baseline labs should include CBC, LFTs, and CMP, with periodic monitoring of CBC and LFTs every 4–8 weeks initially, then every 3 months once stable. Pregnancy testing and reliable contraception are mandatory given teratogenicity. I should confirm drug–drug interactions, notably with PPIs and antacids that can reduce exposure, and consider therapeutic drug monitoring of mycophenolic acid in select cases, where emerging data suggest higher residual concentrations may correlate with better FVC outcomes, though this remains investigational [^116TD3ff] [^111kY3jH] [^111MrWt4] [^114s7cQ8].

> Hold on, I should verify escalation and duration strategies. Many experts treat for at least 24 months before considering de-escalation, given the time course of benefit observed in trials. Progression despite optimized MMF warrants reassessment of adherence, exposure, and disease phenotype, with consideration of adding nintedanib or switching to CYC, rituximab, or tocilizumab based on severity, tempo, and patient factors. Structured monitoring with PFTs, symptom tracking, and HRCT at intervals supports timely adjustments [^116TD3ff] [^113kUZYX] [^112EFpj6].

> Let me reconsider the overall evidentiary picture and communicate uncertainty. While head-to-head superiority of MMF over CYC was not demonstrated in SLS II, the within-treatment improvements, better tolerability, and supportive meta-analytic and observational data converge on a clinically meaningful role for MMF in SSc-ILD and broader CTD-ILD, with the strength of recommendation reflecting consensus despite very low certainty. Ongoing trials and real-world studies should clarify optimal duration, exposure targets, and combination strategies [^113kUZYX] [^112Gi4BK] [^112vh2sw].

> In summary, MMF is a first-line, disease-modifying immunosuppressant for SSc-ILD and a preferred option across many CTD-ILDs, offering modest but clinically important improvements or stabilization in lung function with a favorable toxicity profile relative to CYC. Implementation requires careful dosing, monitoring, and contraception, with escalation to antifibrotics or biologics in progressive disease, all aligned with shared decision-making and longitudinal reassessment of response [^113kUZYX] [^114XLjT7] [^113YjMYr].

MMF is a **first-line therapy** for CTD-ILD, especially SSc-ILD [^113YjMYr], with evidence of stabilizing or modestly improving lung function and a favorable tolerability profile compared with cyclophosphamide [^116hxBCT]. It is not effective in IPF and should be avoided there [^112ATYfC]. Typical dosing is 1.5–3 g/day [^116TD3ff], with monitoring for GI upset, hematologic effects, and infection risk [^111kY3jH]; teratogenicity mandates strict contraception [^111zbQwY]. MMF is recommended by ATS/ERS and BSR for SSc-ILD [^113kUZYX] [^114XLjT7], and is often combined with nintedanib in progressive fibrosis [^114Ut6fV].

---

## Mechanism of action

MMF inhibits inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, **reducing lymphocyte proliferation** and cytokine production, thereby attenuating inflammation and fibrosis in ILD [^11319A8o].

---

## Clinical evidence in ILD

### Systemic sclerosis-associated ILD (SSc-ILD)

- **Scleroderma Lung Study II (SLS II)**: MMF (1.5 g twice daily for 24 months) was non-inferior to cyclophosphamide (CYC) for FVC change at 24 months, with better tolerability and fewer hematologic adverse effects [^116hxBCT].

- **Long-term observational data**: MMF maintains lung function and is well tolerated over extended follow-up [^114zaZXr].

- **Guideline support**: ATS/ERS and BSR recommend MMF as first-line therapy for SSc-ILD [^114XLjT7].

---

### Other connective tissue disease-associated ILD (CTD-ILD)

In CTD-ILD, MMF shows **favorable outcomes** in polymyositis/dermatomyositis and mixed CTD, with stabilization or improvement in lung function and good tolerability [^1131cY93] [^1177drKr] [^114zaZXr].

---

### Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)

MMF is **not recommended** in IPF due to lack of efficacy and potential harm [^112ATYfC].

---

## Safety and tolerability

MMF is **generally well tolerated**; common adverse effects include gastrointestinal symptoms, hematologic abnormalities, and infection risk [^112LMP1R]. Teratogenicity requires effective contraception [^116oqz5E].

## Comparison with other immunosuppressive agents

| **Agent** | **Efficacy** | **Safety profile** | **Guideline recommendation** |
|-|-|-|-|
| MMF | - Stabilizes/improves FVC in SSc-ILD [^116hxBCT] <br/> - Well tolerated [^114zaZXr] | - Gastrointestinal <br/> - Hematologic <br/> - Infection risk [^111kY3jH] | First-line in SSc-ILD [^113kUZYX] [^114XLjT7] |
| Cyclophosphamide | - Modest FVC improvement [^116ExwFx] <br/> - Higher toxicity [^116hxBCT] | - Hemorrhagic cystitis <br/> - Malignancy risk <br/> - Infertility [^notfound] | Alternative option [^113kUZYX] |
| Azathioprine | Limited evidence; less robust than MMF [^112Gi4BK] | Hematologic toxicity [^116SQd5Q] | Alternative option [^115cuq9D] |
| Rituximab | Effective in refractory CTD-ILD [^114Vrv8F] | Infusion reactions <br/> - Infection risk [^notfound] | Second-line option [^113kUZYX] |
| Nintedanib | Reduces FVC decline in progressive fibrosing ILD [^113YjMYr] | Gastrointestinal adverse effects [^11768Y2T] | Approved for progressive fibrosing ILD [^114g5ZXz] |

---

## Current clinical guidelines

- **ATS/ERS 2024**: Strong recommendation for MMF in SSc-ILD [^113kUZYX].

- **BSR 2024**: MMF as first-line therapy for SSc-ILD [^114XLjT7].

- **ACR/CHEST 2024**: MMF, rituximab, or CYC for progressive SARD-associated ILD [^1138bKno].

---

## Ongoing research and future directions

Research is evaluating **MMF plus nintedanib** in progressive fibrosing ILD [^114Ut6fV] and exploring pharmacokinetic monitoring to optimize exposure and outcomes [^111MrWt4].

---

MMF is a **first-line therapy** for CTD-ILD, particularly SSc-ILD, with evidence of stabilizing lung function and a favorable safety profile. It is not recommended for IPF, and ongoing research aims to refine its use in combination regimens and through exposure monitoring.

INTRODUCTION

Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a complex connective tissue disease characterized by autoimmunity, vasculopathy, and fibrosis of skin and internal organs. Prevalence of SSc associated with interstitial lung disease (SSc‐ILD) is estimated to be between 35% and 52% of SSc patients, but presence of lung abnormalities assessed by high‐resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the thorax has been described in up to 80% of SSc patients.

Significance & Innovations

Analyzing patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc) who were followed in our cohort through serial high‐resolution computed tomography (HRCTs), we observed a clear reduction in the extent of interstitial lung disease (ILD) 1 year after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).
Literature on HSCT in SSc mainly derives from randomized controlled trials. Our work contributes real‐world data about the evolution of SSc‐associated ILD after HSCT.
Our findings suggest a weak correlation between changes in HRCT and modifications of pulmonary function tests.

Complementarily to pulmonary function tests (PFTs), HRCT is the recommended screening tool to detect ILD in patients with SSc. With HRCT, ground‐glass opacities (GGO), reticulations, subpleural nodules, and honeycombing, which are the characteristic features of ILD, can be recognized. It is also possible to identify the ILD pattern that, in SSc, is predominantly nonspecific interstitial pneumonia. Moreover, distinguishing patients with or without extensive lung involvement has significant treatment implications, underlining the prognostic relevance of HRCT.

In general, there are 2 treatment regimens most frequently adopted for SSc‐ILD. Based on the results of Scleroderma Lung Study I (SLS‐I) and II (SLS‐II), an induction phase with cyclophosphamide (CYC) that is followed or not followed by maintenance therapy with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) or azathioprine, or, alternatively, MMF alone, are often chosen. The role of biologic therapies, such as tocilizumab or rituximab, is not yet supported by strong evidence, and the advent of antifibrotic agents promises to enrich the narrow armamentarium for SSc‐ILD. According to the latest update of the European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR) recommendations for the treatment of SSc and after 3 positive randomized controlled trials (RCTs), hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the other option to be considered for SSc‐ILD in selected patients with rapidly progressive disease who are at risk of organ failure (after thorough screening).

### Mycophenolate mofetil versus oral cyclophosphamide in scleroderma-related interstitial lung disease (SLS II): a randomised controlled, double-blind, parallel group trial [^1158yHSs]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

The data coordinating center at UCLA confirmed all entry criteria and randomly assigned patients using a double-blind, double-dummy, center-blocked design to receive either once-daily oral CYC during the initial 12 months followed by placebo for the second 12 months or twice daily MMF administered for the entire 24 months. Masking was carried out by the UCLA Pharmacy Core, which formulated all study drugs (25 mg of CYC, 250 mg of MMF or placebo) into matching 250 mg gel-capsules. Patients received medications as single dose packages containing either 6 or 8 capsules, depending upon patient weight, with the composition of the capsules (active vs placebo) adjusted by the pharmacist to administer the required daily dose while maintaining the blind.

### Mycophenolate and azathioprine efficacy in interstitial lung disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115MKw4Z]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2024). High credibility.

The first meta-analysis examining the safety and efficacy of MMF in ILD associated with systemic sclerosis, conducted by Tzouvelekis et al included both retrospective and one prospective study. The outcomes of their study align with our findings, indicating an acceptable safety profile for MMF without clear evidence regarding its effectiveness on pulmonary function. Similarly, network meta-analysis in systemic sclerosis associated ILD did not identify significant treatment efficacy of MMF, nor AZA in combination with cyclosporin-A. Further studies are necessary across ILD diagnoses to ascertain potential efficacy in disease subtypes.

This study employed a comprehensive search strategy and strict inclusion criteria, which focused on prospective designs and trials. To support quality, estimates were specifically provided for trial designs along with GRADE assessment. We did not include restrictions on study language or cohort size. MMF and AZA were evaluated in prespecified subgroup analysis based on drug. Where study designs included other treatments, data were collected to support interpretation of MMF or AZA with omission of the drug in comparator arms. Effects regarding AZA should be interpreted with great caution due to limited studies and insufficient studies for primary analysis. Those involving AZA included an active intervention of Cyclosporin-A in the comparator, with addition of AZA in the treatment group, precluded specific interpretation of AZA alone. The limited representation of AZA in the recent literature may be partially attributed to the results of the PANTHER trial, where AZA in combination with n-acetylcysteine and prednisone led to worse outcomes in patients with IPF. Mankikian et al designed an RCT randomising rituximab+MMF versus MMF, we extracted data only from the MMF arm for secondary endpoints. Furthermore, studies were not consistent in ILD diagnosis inclusion, with the majority of prospective observational studies including systemic sclerosis-associated ILD; trials included IPF, non-specific interstitial pneumonia and CTD-ILD, which may contribute to heterogeneity in effect estimates. While ongoing studies were identified, MMF studies did not included blinded phase III RCTs and no AZA studies were identified.

In conclusion, the beneficial impact of MMF and AZA on pulmonary function in patients with ILD is uncertain with some weak evidence that suggests a need to further investigate the effect of MMF in preserving function. While MMF and AZA were generally well tolerated in patients with ILD, it is important to note that the certainty of effects on pulmonary function was very low. Further well-designed RCTs across diagnoses of fibrotic and inflammatory ILD are necessary to support high certainty evidence.

### Tacrolimus as first line therapy in a U.S. cohort of idiopathic inflammatory myopathies related interstitial lung disease [^1135Envh]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Calcineurin inhibitors are commonly used to treat idiopathic inflammatory myopathies associated interstitial lung disease (IIM-ILD) in Asia but not in the U.S. Here, we evaluate the efficacy of tacrolimus (TAC) as first-line immunosuppressive therapy in a U.S cohort of IIM-ILD.

Methods

This retrospective, single-centre cohort study evaluated the change in absolute forced vital capacity (FVCabs) in IIM-ILD participants after 12months of treatment with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), azathioprine (AZA), or TAC. Participants were naïve to immunosuppressive agents other than glucocorticoids and/or intravenous immunoglobulin. Treatment with MMF, AZA, or TAC was at the discretion of their primary clinician. Additional outcomes were transplant free survival, prednisone use, and supplemental oxygen use at 12months.

Results

Thirty-one participants were included in this study. The TAC group was younger and had a shorter disease duration than the MMF/AZA group. All MDA5 patients were treated with TAC. After 12months of therapy, the FVCabs was unchanged in the MMF/AZA group (2.4l [95%CI 2.0, 3.2l] vs 2.3l [95%CI 2.0, 2.8l]) and improved in TAC group (2.5l [95%CI 2.0, 3.0l] vs.1.9L [95%CI 1.0, 2.6l]). Transplant free survival was 100% in both groups. All patients in the MMF/AZA group remained on supplemental oxygen at 12months, but 4/5 patients in the TAC group resolved their oxygen requirement.

Conclusion

TAC is effective as a first-line agent in a small, non-randomized U.S. cohort of IIM-ILD enriched for MDA5+ participants. Further work is needed to investigate the relative efficacy of calcineurin inhibitors compared with MMF/AZA in the U.S. population.

SSc-ILD — quality of evidence for nintedanib plus mycophenolate: The quality of the evidence for all outcomes was rated as very low, meaning the committee had very low confidence in the estimated effects, and effect estimates should be interpreted with caution because each outcome was informed by at most only a single study leading to imprecision; study design limitations also downgraded evidence quality, as the majority were derived from a post hoc analysis of an RCT; furthermore, although nintedanib was randomized, background mycophenolate therapy was not and those patients had several demographic differences compared with patients not on background mycophenolate.

### Mycophenolate and azathioprine efficacy in interstitial lung disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112Gi4BK]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2024). High credibility.

Objectives

Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and azathioprine (AZA) are immunomodulatory treatments in interstitial lung disease (ILD). This systematic review aimed to evaluate the efficacy of MMF or AZA on pulmonary function in ILD.

Design

Population included any ILD diagnosis, intervention included MMF or AZA treatment, outcome was delta change from baseline in per cent predicted forced vital capacity (%FVC) and gas transfer (diffusion lung capacity of carbon monoxide, %DLco). The primary endpoint compared outcomes relative to placebo comparator, the secondary endpoint assessed outcomes in treated groups only.

Eligibility Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective observational studies were included. No language restrictions were applied. Retrospective studies and studies with high-dose concomitant steroids were excluded.

Data Synthesis

The systematic search was performed on 9 May. Meta-analyses according to drug and outcome were specified with random effects, I 2 evaluated heterogeneity and Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation evaluated certainty of evidence. Primary endpoint analysis was restricted to RCT design, secondary endpoint included subgroup analysis according to prospective observational or RCT design.

Results

A total of 2831 publications were screened, 12 were suitable for quantitative synthesis. Three MMF RCTs were included with no significant effect on the primary endpoints (%FVC 2.94, 95% CI -4.00 to 9.88, I² = 79.3%; %DLco -2.03, 95% CI -4.38 to 0.32, I² = 0.0%). An overall 2.03% change from baseline in %FVC (95% CI 0.65 to 3.42, I² = 0.0%) was observed in MMF, and RCT subgroup summary estimated a 4.42% change from baseline in %DL CO (95% CI 2.05 to 6.79, I² = 0.0%). AZA studies were limited. All estimates were considered very low certainty evidence.

Conclusions

There were limited RCTs of MMF or AZA and their benefit in ILD was of very low certainty. MMF may support preservation of pulmonary function, yet confidence in the effect was weak. To support high certainty evidence, RCTs should be designed to directly assess MMF efficacy in ILD.

### Treatment of systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease: evidence-based recommendations. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^112asmpB]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Mycophenolate for SSc-ILD — question scope, comparators, outcomes, and evidence base: The committee asked, "Should patients with SSc-ILD be treated with mycophenolate?", noting mycophenolate is an inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase that impairs T and B cell proliferation and considering cyclophosphamide and placebo as appropriate comparators. Critical outcomes included mortality and disease progression (defined as changes in FVC, DLco, radiologic disease, and the mRSS), with important outcomes including quality of life indices (including the Transition Dyspnea Index [TDI]) and adverse events. A systematic review identified studies of mycophenolate, including two RCTs and two observational studies, and two studies comparing mycophenolate to placebo.

### Expert consensus on the management of systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease [^112S6Dtq]. Respiratory Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Management of disease progression

Panelists reached consensus on the possibility of adding further agents for patients with progression/worsening of ILD, but did not reach consensus on switching to another agent or continuing therapy under these circumstances. Panelists agreed that patients should be weaned from therapy in cases of drug toxicity, stable lung and skin symptoms for ≥ 2 years, a patient's strong desire to discontinue treatment, or lack of efficacy (Fig. 5). Tapering/weaning therapy should take place over 1–2 years while monitoring PFTs every 6 months, with or without a low maintenance dose of MMF, and treatment should not be withdrawn abruptly.

Consensus was reached that disease progression should be monitored using changes in PFTs (FVC or DL CO), HRCT (ILD patterns or extent of fibrosis), and symptoms over time, or by presence of desaturation on exercise (Fig. 6). Conversely, stabilization or improvement of FVC, DL CO, HRCT, or 6-min walk distance (6MWD), stabilization of symptoms, level of desaturation on exercise, and functional status as assessed by New York Heart Association Functional Classification or cardiopulmonary exercise testing were indicative of treatment success (Fig. 6, Additional file 1: Table S1).

### Mycophenolate mofetil versus oral cyclophosphamide in scleroderma-related interstitial lung disease (SLS II): a randomised controlled, double-blind, parallel group trial [^116PqkiF]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Outcomes

Our primary hypothesis was that MMF would have a significantly greater effect on % predicted FVC than CYC, when measured over the entire 24 months, with an expected effect size at 24 months of 4% after adjustment for baseline FVC and HRCT-measured fibrosis score. This hypothesis was based on the assumption that MMF would be as effective as CYC during the first 18 months (point of maximal CYC improvement in %-predicted FVC in SLS I), and that continued treatment with MMF would at least maintain FVC at this value, while the 1-year treatment with CYC would be associated with a fall in %-predicted FVC back to untreated values by 24 months. The primary outcome variable addressed all of these assumptions simultaneously by focusing on the course of the FVC % over time from 3 to 24 months. Finally, it was also hypothesized that MMF would be safer and better tolerated than CYC as measured by the frequency of protocol-defined adverse events (AEs), all patient-reported AEs and serious AE (SAEs), study withdrawals and treatment failures. Treatment failure, mandating withdrawal from active study treatment, was defined as an absolute decrease from baseline FVC of ≥ 15% of predicted occurring ≥ 3 months after randomization and lasting for ≥ 1 month.

Secondary outcome variables included the following: the course from 3 to 24 months of the DLCO %-predicted, TDI and mRSS scores, and the change from baseline in quantitative HRCT scores for lung fibrosis and total ILD at 24 months.

An independent three-person Morbidity and Mortality Committee reviewed the causes of all SAEs and deaths to determine relatedness (to treatment, underlying disease or unrelated cause).

### New horizons in systemic sclerosis treatment: advances and emerging therapies in 2025 [^115Wg8rM]. RMD Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Management of ILD

The management of SSc-ILD has evolved based on extensive clinical trial data evaluating immunosuppressants (CYC, MMF), biologics (TCZ, rituximab (RTX)), antifibrotic agents (nintedanib) and AHSCT. Figure 2 summarises key trials and outcomes.

Figure 2
Visual representation of clinical trials in SSc and results for ILD. CYC, cyclophosphamide; FVC, forced vital capacity; MMF, mycophenolate mofetil; mRSS, modified Rodnan skin score; ILD, interstitial lung disease; MTX, methotrexate; RECITAL, Rituximab Versus Cyclophosphamide in Connective Tissue Diseases-Interstitial Lung Disease SLS II; Scleroderma Lung Study II; SSc, systemic sclerosis; TCZ, tocilizumab.

CYC was historically considered a standard treatment for SSc-ILD, but its long-term use is limited by toxicity concerns. The SLS I (2006) demonstrated that oral CYC significantly improved FVC compared with placebo, with an absolute mean difference of +2.53% (p < 0.03), along with improvements in dyspnoea and quality of life. Subsequently, the SLS II (2018) compared MMF and CYC in patients with SSc-ILD. Although the difference in FVC between CYC (−2.88%) and MMF (−2.19%) at 24 months was not statistically significant (p = 0.24), MMF had a better safety profile, with a lower mortality rate (7% with MMF vs 15% with CYC). As a result, MMF is now recommended as the first-line therapy for SSc-ILD, particularly for long-term disease stabilisation.

Regarding medical management for connective tissue disease-associated interstitial lung disease, more specifically with respect to initial treatment, immunosuppressants, PDSS-CEP 2021 guidelines recommend to consider initiating mycophenolate mofetil or azathioprine in patients with symptomatic Sjögren's disease-associated ILD with moderate-to-severe impairment on pulmonary function tests, imaging, or gas-exchange if long-term corticosteroids are initiated and corticosteroid-sparing immunosuppressive therapy is required.

### Mycophenolate mofetil is an effective and safe option for the management of systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease: results from the Australian scleroderma cohort study [^114FFiTm]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

To report the efficacy and tolerability of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and azathioprine (AZA) in the management of systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD).

Methods

Patients in the Australian Scleroderma Cohort Study treated with at least 3 months of MMF or AZA for SSc-ILD confirmed on high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) chest were identified and their pulmonary function tests (PFTs) retrieved. Individuals with available results for T-1 (12 months prior to treatment commencement), T0 (date of treatment commencement) and at least one subsequent time point were included in the drug efficacy analysis. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare absolute FVC at T1, T0, 12 months (T1), 24 months (T2) and 36 months (T3). Analysis of drug tolerability included all identified patients treated with MMF or AZA.

Results

18/22 patients treated with MMF and 29/49 treated with AZA had adequate PFTs for inclusion in the drug efficacy analysis. Median absolute FVC at T1 for MMF treatment was 2.50L, declining to 2.12L at T0 (p = 0.02). Following MMF therapy, FVC results were stable at T1 (2.13L, p = 0.86), T2 (2.17L, p = 0.65) and T3 (2.25L, p = 0.78). In the AZA group, a statistically significant decline did not occur prior to treatment, however FVC results remained stable at T1, T2 and T3. Adverse events leading to early discontinuation (< 12 months treatment) were less common in the MMF group (4/22 vs. 13/49). Gastrointestinal complications were the main cause of discontinuation in both groups.

Conclusions

In patients with SSc-ILD with declining pulmonary function, MMF therapy was associated with stability for up to 36 months. Early adverse events leading to discontinuation occurred less frequently in patients treated with MMF than in AZA treated patients.

Systemic sclerosis-interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD) is a major complication of SSc resulting in important morbidity and mortality. Next to cyclophosphamide and mycophenolate mofetil, tocilizumab and nintedanib have proven efficacy in the treatment of SSc-ILD. The highly variable course of SSc-ILD, the complexity in determining and predicting the progression of SSc-ILD, and the diversity of treatment options for SSc-ILD, pose many challenges for everyday clinical practice. In this review, currently available evidence for monitoring and treatment of SSc-ILD is summarized and areas where additional evidence is highly desirable are discussed.

6.2 Postmarketing Experience

The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Mycophenolate Mofetil. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure:

Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Congenital malformations and spontaneous abortions, mainly in the first trimester, have been reported following exposure to mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) in combination with other immunosuppressants during pregnancy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), and Use in Specific Populations (8.1), (8.3)]. Congenital malformations include:
Facial malformations: cleft lip, cleft palate, micrognathia, hypertelorism of the orbits.
Abnormalities of the ear and eye: abnormally formed or absent external/middle ear, coloboma, microphthalmos.
Malformations of the fingers: polydactyly, syndactyly, brachydactyly.
Cardiac abnormalities: atrial and ventricular septal defects.
Esophageal malformations: esophageal atresia.
Nervous system malformations: such as spina bifida.
Cardiovascular: Venous thrombosis has been reported in patients treated with Mycophenolate Mofetil administered intravenously.
Digestive: Colitis, pancreatitis
Hematologic and Lymphatic: Bone marrow failure, cases of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) and hypogammaglobulinemia have been reported in patients treated with Mycophenolate Mofetil in combination with other immunosuppressive agents [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].
Immune: Hypersensitivity, hypogammaglobinemia.
Infections: Meningitis, infectious endocarditis, tuberculosis, atypical mycobacterial infection, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, BK virus infection, viral reactivation of hepatitis B and hepatitis C, protozoal infections [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].
Respiratory: Bronchiectasis, interstitial lung disease, fatal pulmonary fibrosis, have been reported rarely and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of pulmonary symptoms ranging from dyspnea to respiratory failure in post-transplant patients receiving Mycophenolate Mofetil.
Vascular: Lymphocele

### Treatment outcomes for rheumatoid arthritis-associated interstitial lung disease: a real-world, multisite study of the impact of immunosuppression on pulmonary function trajectory [^111gEaN3]. Chest (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA)-associated interstitial lung disease (ILD) is common in patients with RA and leads to significant morbidity and mortality. No randomized, placebo-controlled data are available that support the role of immunosuppression to treat RA-associated ILD, despite being widely used in clinical practice.

Research Question

How does immunosuppression impact pulmonary function trajectory in a multisite retrospective cohort of patients with RA-associated ILD?

Study Design and Methods

Patients with RA who started treatment for ILD with mycophenolate, azathioprine, or rituximab were identified retrospectively from five ILD centers. Change in lung function before and after treatment was analyzed using a linear spline mixed-effect model with random intercept. Prespecified secondary analyses examined the impact of radiologic pattern of ILD (ie, usual interstitial pneumonia [UIP] vs non-UIP) on treatment trajectory.

Results

Two hundred twelve patients were included in the analysis: 92 patients (43.4%) were treated with azathioprine, 77 patients (36.3%) were treated with mycophenolate mofetil, and 43 patients (20.3%) were treated with rituximab. In the combined analysis of all three agents, an improvement in FVC % predicted was found after 12 months of treatment compared with the potential 12-month response without treatment (+3.90%; P ≤ .001; 95% CI, 1.95–5.84). Diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (Dlco) % predicted also improved at 12 months (+4.53%; P ≤ .001; 95% CI, 2.12–6.94). Neither the UIP pattern of ILD nor choice of immunosuppressive agent significantly impacted the pulmonary function trajectory on immunosuppression.

Interpretation

Immunosuppression was associated with an improved trajectory in FVC and Dlco compared with the pretreatment pulmonary function trajectory. Prospective, randomized trials are required to validate these findings.

### Mycophenolate and azathioprine efficacy in interstitial lung disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1144qssu]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

This systematic review and meta-analysis suggested an unclear benefit of MMF or AZA on FVC or DL CO in people with ILD. Secondary endpoint analysis of change over time stratified by treatment suggested a minor increase in %FVC or %DL CO compared with baseline in MMF treated groups. The review highlighted a limited number of trials and prospective observational studies that directly tested the effect of MMF or AZA on lung function in the current literature, particularly precluding interpretations on the efficacy of AZA.

All estimates based on MMF RCT data were of very low GRADE certainty of evidence. Risk of bias was deemed moderate as one trial included unblinded participants, one study was post hoc analysis of trial data, and all trials had potential issues in blinding of outcome assessment. Heterogeneity and differences in the direction of effect across RCTs contributed to inconsistency. Imprecision was considered high due to limited RCTs, small samples and small effect sizes with wide CIs. Indirectness was deemed moderate as studies included different diagnoses. There was no strong evidence of publication bias. While these findings provide some indication of the effect, all estimates should be considered weak evidence with a high likelihood that additional studies may change effect estimates in a manner sufficient to influence decision-making.

Primary endpoint analysis in MMF observed no significant effect of treatment vs comparator groups for %FVC or %DL CO, although a non-significant effect in %DL CO favoured comparator. In contrast, secondary endpoint analysis suggested that MMF treatments could improve on baseline pulmonary function, although this may be insufficient relative to placebo. In further subanalyses restricted to MMF, greater improvement in %FVC was observed at longer follow-up, with no difference according to study design. Conversely, greater improvement in %DL CO was observed in trial designs, with no difference according to follow-up timing. While heterogeneity was minimised in subgroup analyses, effect sizes were small.

In the narrative review of adverse events, we found that both treatments were well tolerated, however, studies on real-world data suggest difficulties in tolerability. The most frequent adverse events observed with MMF and AZA treatment included respiratory infections and haematological disorders. It is noteworthy that these adverse events were often mild and did not typically require specific treatment nor differ to events encountered in standard treatments. MMF or AZA interruption due to adverse events led to treatment discontinuation only in a few cases. Symptoms appeared to slightly improve after treatment commenced, but stricter interventional vs placebo studies are needed to assess the real effect on patient-reported outcomes.

MMF or AZA efficacy in secondary endpoints

A total of 6 prospective observational studiesand 5 RCTswere included in secondary analysis of the difference between follow-up and baseline in %FVC, including a combined sample of 267 evaluated at baseline and 244 at follow-up, representing 7.5% loss to follow up. In prespecified subgroup analysis by drug (online supplemental figure 3A), treatment with AZA suggested a decline in %FVC with treatment, although this was not statistically significant (two studies; WMD −6.14, 95% CI −12.88 to 0.61, I² = 48.3%). Treatment with MMF was observed to have a small and significant increase in %FVC value at follow-up (nine studies; WMD 2.03, 95% CI 0.65 to 3.42, I² = 0.0%). Additional subgroup analyses performed on MMF treatment observed similar effect sizes according to study design and very low certainty of evidence (figure 4A, table 2), while a greater effect of MMF was observed at follow-up of 12 months or over with no significant heterogeneity between time points (online supplemental figure 4A).

### Expert consensus on the management of systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease [^114cbXvF]. Respiratory Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Management approach based on specialty

There were subtle differences in responses between rheumatologists and pulmonologists (Table 2). Pulmonologists achieved consensus in favor of assessing 6MWD for screening, deciding whether to treat, and defining treatment success, whereas rheumatologists did not rate this assessment so highly. Conversely, pulmonologists did not reach consensus on whether FVC and/or DL CO below the lower limit of normal would prompt immediate treatment. Pulmonologists aligned with panel consensus supporting consideration of reflux when deciding whether to treat; rheumatologists aligned with the panel against the use of methotrexate as an initial treatment option for SSc-ILD. Although both groups agreed that MMF should be the initial treatment of choice, rheumatologists were more comfortable using rituximab as potential therapy.

*Data from the 2022 supplementary Delphi

The potential use of antifibrotic drugs was more strongly supported by pulmonologists than by rheumatologists. Pulmonologists (but not rheumatologists) achieved consensus for the use of nintedanib in patients with a lack of response to MMF, CYC, or TCZ as defined by no improvement in lung function, and in any patients with connective tissue disease with clinically significant or worsening ILD. Conversely, there was consensus amongst only rheumatologists that nintedanib could be used as add-on therapy to TCZ.

Overall, rheumatologists were more comfortable than pulmonologists with defining how TCZ should be used as a treatment option for SSc-ILD. There was consensus support amongst rheumatologists (but not pulmonologists) for the use of TCZ in patients with early SSc and ILD with topoisomerase antibodies, worsening condition defined as deteriorating symptoms and ILD on HRCT and PFTs, and those unable to continue CYC, MMF, or antifibrotics due to adverse effects or lack of achievement with the effective dose.

### Off-label use of mycophenolate mofetil in the treatment of rare and complex rheumatic connective tissue diseases [^112tEUq5]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

We aimed to investigate the clinical off-label use of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), including its safety and efficacy in patients with rare and complex rheumatic connective tissue diseases (rCTDs).

Methods

A survey was distributed across experts from ERN-ReCONNET reference centres in order to assess the experience with MMF off-label use. Patient-level data of patients with rCTDs under treatment with MMF was also collected for analysis of safety and efficacy.

Results

Twelve experts from eleven centres distributed throughout Europe (7 countries) answered the survey. The experience was concordant in that, despite of its off-label use, experts reported opting frequently for this therapeutic alternative with robust confidence on its efficacy and safety. The analysis of 108 patients with rCTDs under MMF revealed a good safety profile, as well as good clinical outcomes, especially for systemic lupus erythematosus and idiopathic inflammatory myopathies. The presence of interstitial lung disease was, as expected, associated with a worse clinical outcome despite use of MMF.

Conclusions

MMF is widely used in reference centres for rCTDs. Its safety profile and efficacy seem to be recognised by experts and demonstrated with patient-level analysis. While selected rCTDs will likely remain an off-label indication for MMF, robust data seem to support this therapy as an appropriate alternative for safely and effectively treating many manifestations of rCTDs.

### Therapeutic approach to adult fibrotic lung diseases [^1151yexS]. Chest (2016). Low credibility.

Interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) are a diverse group of parenchymal pulmonary disorders characterized by varying degrees of inflammation and fibrosis. When pulmonary fibrosis predominates, ILDs are especially challenging to manage and treat. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis (cHP), and connective tissue disease-related ILD (CTD-ILD) are associated with significant mortality. Other less well-characterized types of fibrotic ILD include fibrotic nonspecific interstitial pneumonia and interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features, with a usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) pattern. Although a conservative approach to management has been advocated in early or mild ILD, antiinflammatory and immunosuppressive therapies are considered and often prescribed when progression of CTD-ILD and cHP occurs despite the largely unproven efficacy in these disorders. A recently completed trial comparing mycophenolate mofetil with oral cyclophosphamide in systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD) showed noninferiority with mycophenolate mofetil. Two novel antifibrotic agents, nintedanib and pirfenidone, which slowed lung function decline and disease progression in patients with IPF and mild to moderate lung disease, are now approved for the treatment of IPF, a generally progressive and fatal disorder. No strong recommendations can be made regarding the use of nintedanib or pirfenidone in cHP or fibrotic CTD-ILD until the safety and efficacy of these agents are formally evaluated in such populations. Adjunct therapies for patients with fibrotic ILD include oxygen to correct hypoxemia and the identification and treatment of comorbidities.

The present article reviews the most recent advances in the clinical management and medical therapy for the three common fibrotic ILDs: IPF, cHP, and CTD-ILD.

### Mycophenolate mofetil versus oral cyclophosphamide in scleroderma-related interstitial lung disease (SLS II): a randomised controlled, double-blind, parallel group trial [^114H54C9]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Employing a double-blind, randomized controlled clinical trial approach, SLS II compared a continuous 24-month course of MMF with a 12-month course of oral CYC (followed by 12 months of placebo) for the treatment of symptomatic SSc-ILD. Contrary to the central component of the primary study hypothesis, no significant difference was observed between the two treatment arms in the course of FVC % over 24 months. If considered in isolation, one would consider this as a "negative study". However, the failure to identify a difference between treatments was not due to a lack of efficacy. As hypothesized, both treatments produced improvements in lung function, making this the first prospective randomized controlled trial to document a positive response in patients with SSc-ILD after treatment with MMF. The average peak improvement from baseline occurred at 18–21 months in both treatment arms (Figure 2A), similar to findings with CYC from the SLS I study. What did not occur as originally hypothesized was the nearly-complete loss of efficacy beyond 18 months (i.e. beyond 6 months after the study drug was discontinued) in those patients assigned to the CYC arm. While the average FVC % did decline between 21 and 24 months, this occurred in both arms and was modest in magnitude.

It is important to consider alternative explanations, other than loss of efficacy, for the observed decline in lung function between 18–24 months. One consideration is that the values between 18 and 24 months reflect a weighted mean effect – i.e. the impact of having subjects who prematurely withdrew from treatment (and did worse) return for the final outcome measures. Indeed, at the 24 month time-point there were 15 such patients in the CYC arm and 4 in the MMF arm. Furthermore, in a secondary analysis we observed that the change in FVC % from baseline to 24 months improved over time in the overwhelming majority of patients who completed therapy (CYC = 80.6%; MMF = 75.5%) whereas the majority of subjects who had prematurely withdrawn from treatment but returned for the primary outcome measure experienced a loss of lung function over time (Figure 2B). The net impact of including data from all subjects at the 24-month time point would therefore appear as a terminal decline in lung function.

Quality of evidence

The quality of evidence was very low by the GRADE approach because of bias (premature closure of enrollment), imprecision (limited number of participants/studies contributing to the findings, lack of uniform distribution of mycophenolate treatment in the pirfenidone and mycophenolate participants), and indirectness of evidence (post hoc analysis of data).

Recommendation 8: We recommend further research into the safety and efficacy of pirfenidone plus mycophenolate combination therapy to treat patients with SSc-ILD

The voting by the committee was as follows: strong recommendation for pirfenidone plus mycophenolate, 0 of 13 (0%); conditional recommendation for pirfenidone plus mycophenolate, 0 of 13 (0%); conditional recommendation against pirfenidone plus mycophenolate, 1 of 13 (8%); and strong recommendation against pirfenidone plus mycophenolate, 0 of 13 (0%). Twelve participants (92%) abstained from voting, citing insufficient evidence to render a thoughtful judgment.

Justification and implementation considerations

Given the > 20% abstention rate citing insufficient evidence to render a thoughtful judgment by the voting members of the committee, an insufficient quorum was reached. Instead, a research recommendation is made for further evaluation of combination treatment with pirfenidone plus mycophenolate in SSc-ILD.

Future research opportunities

Because of the paucity of studies looking specifically at the combination of mycophenolate and pirfenidone for the treatment of patients with SSc-ILD, future research should focus on this combination against placebo and mycophenolate alone with larger sample sizes and by disease status (initial diagnosis of SSc-ILD, stable SSc-ILD, progressive SSc-ILD).

Immunosuppressive therapies

Immunosuppressive medications are not appropriate in the chronic management of IPF given the increased risk of mortality and other adverse consequences, without any clear benefit. Based on these findings, immunosuppressive medications are used with great caution in patients with an IPF-like phenotype. Conversely, these medications are generally considered appropriate in many patients with CTD-ILD or fibrotic HP, and in some patients with unclassifiable ILD (Table 2).

### Perspectives on mycophenolate mofetil in the management of autoimmunity [^111nwZfu]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2023). Medium credibility.

Before becoming a cornerstone in the treatment of numerous immune-mediated diseases, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) was first introduced as an immunosuppressive agent in transplant immunology and later received the attention of rheumatologists and clinicians involved in the management of autoimmune diseases. MMF is now a widespread immunosuppressive drug for the treatment of several conditions, including lupus nephritis, interstitial lung disease associated with systemic sclerosis, and anti-neutrophil cytoplasm antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis while being efficacious also as rescue therapy in various orphan diseases, including dermatomyositis and IgA-associated nephropathy. Similarly, case reports or series support a possible use of MMF in other rare autoimmune diseases. Beyond modulating lymphocyte activation, MMF acts on other immune and non-immune cells and these effects may explain the therapeutic profile of this medication. The effects of MMF are broadly characterized by the impact on the immune system and the antiproliferative and antifibrotic changes induced. In this latter case, mechanistic data on fibroblasts may in the future allow to reevaluate the use of MMF in selected patients with inflammatory arthritis or systemic sclerosis. Attention must be paid towards the possible occurrence of adverse events, such as gastrointestinal complaints and teratogenicity, while the risk of infections and cancer related to MMF needs to be further investigated.

### Usefulness of monitoring mycophenolic acid exposure in systemic sclerosis-related interstitial lung disease: a retrospective cohort study [^114s7cQ8]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Systemic sclerosis-related interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD) represents a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in Systemic Sclerosis (SSc). Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is currently the first line treatment for SSc-ILD. There is no recommendation on the dosage of mycophenolic acid (MPA) blood concentrations, so we aimed to study the correlation between MPA exposure and respiratory outcomes in this population.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of SSc-ILD patients treated with MMF in our center. According to our policy, a complete patient evaluation was performed approximately one year after MMF initiation, during which the mycophenolic acid (MPA) residual rate (RR) was measured. We analyzed the association between RR and changes in forced vital capacity (FVC) and diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) over time.

Results

Forty-three SSc-ILD patients were included. Patients with higher RR levels (≥ 1.5 mg/L) had a significantly better FVC evolution with a higher proportion of stabilization and lower proportion of FVC decrease (p = 0.024). RR above 1.5 mg/L was a predictive factor of reduced FVC decline compared with lower RR levels adjusting for MMF dose and duration of MMF exposure (p = 0.008). There was no difference regarding DLCO outcome.

Conclusion

Our study suggests that optimal MPA exposure, as indicated by RR levels, may better protect against FVC decline in SSc-ILD patients treated with MMF. Routine monitoring of MPA exposure could be beneficial in optimizing treatment outcomes. Prospective, multicenter studies are needed to further explore the relationship between MPA exposure and clinical outcomes in SSc-ILD.

### Treatment of systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease: evidence-based recommendations. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^115f7Q82]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Summary of evidence

A systematic review of the evidence identified seven total studies (,–) (Table E2). Two were RCTs: three were post hoc analyses of RCTs, and two were observational studies. Two studies compared mycophenolate to placebo, and five compared mycophenolate to cyclophosphamide. The predominance of data comparing mycophenolate to placebo was from a post hoc study that compared those who received mycophenolate in SLS II with those patients who received placebo in SLS I. The SLS II trial provided the majority of evidence for the comparison between mycophenolate and cyclophosphamide. All studies, except for one, used mycophenolate mofetil for the drug formulation.

D

When compared with placebo, the mean FVC % predicted significantly improved from baseline to 12 and 24 months for mycophenolate, with about a 5% difference between the two arms. In addition, the rate of overall improvement in FVC % predicted at 12 and 24 months was nearly 2.3-fold higher at both time points in the mycophenolate arm compared with placebo. Similarly, the mean change from baseline in D CO % predicted was > 4% less at both 12 and 24 months for the mycophenolate arm compared with placebo, favoring mycophenolate. There were no differences between mycophenolate and cyclophosphamide in mean change in FVC % predicted or D CO % predicted at 12 or 24 months. There were also no differences between mycophenolate and cyclophosphamide in several measures of radiologic disease, given both treatments led to improvements in radiologic disease individually. In addition, between mycophenolate and placebo, changes in the mRSS favored mycophenolate.

M

There was no significant difference in mortality at 24 months between mycophenolate and placebo or between mycophenolate and cyclophosphamide.

QL

Significant differences in breathlessness (measured using the TDI score) at all time points, including 24 months, favored mycophenolate over placebo. There was no difference in any QoL measure between mycophenolate and cyclophosphamide, although both showed significant improvement separately.

A

There was a ninefold increased risk of anemia in patients treated with mycophenolate versus placebo, but there were no differences in premature discontinuation, serious adverse events, hematuria, leukopenia, neutropenia, or thrombocytopenia. Compared with patients receiving cyclophosphamide, the mycophenolate arm had a 41% lower risk of premature discontinuation of therapy for any reason and 86% lower risk of leukopenia.

In subgroup analysis by drug (online supplemental figure 3B), treatment with AZA suggested a decline (two studies; −5.72, 95% CI −13.79 to 2.34, I² = 49.8%), while treatment with MMF suggested an increase (10 studies; 1.62, 95% CI −1.70 to 4.94, I² = 60.5%), although effect estimates did not reach significance and substantial heterogeneity was observed. Additional subgroup analyses performed on MMF treatment observed a significant decline in %DL CO in prospective observation studies (WMD −1.36, 95% CI −2.37 to −0.36, I² = 0.0%) and a significant improvement in RCTs (WMD 4.42, 95% CI 2.05 to 6.79; I² = 0.0%), with substantial heterogeneity between subgroups and very low certainty in evidence (figure 4B, table 2). Subgroup analysis on follow-up time did not observe a significant effect in %DL CO with no significant heterogeneity observed between groups (figure 4B).

Treatment sequencing

Panelists considered MMF as first-line therapy for patients with SSc-ILD at a target dose of 2000–3000 mg daily. Initial nintedanib therapy, at a target dose of 150 mg twice daily, was recommended for patients with longstanding (> 5 years) SSc with ILD and evidence of progression for whom immunosuppression would not be recommended. (Fig. 4 A, Additional file 1: Table S2). It was also considered as add-on therapy to MMF or CYC and following failure of MMF, CYC, and/or TCZ. However, there was no consensus on the use of CYC, rituximab, azathioprine, prednisone, or TCZ as initial therapy, nor for the use of nintedanib as initial therapy in patients other than those previously described (Additional file 1: Table S1). There was consensus against utilizing methotrexate as initial therapy for patients with SSc-ILD, and there was no consensus on the duration of treatment.

### Effect size of rituximab on pulmonary function in the treatment of connective-tissue disease-related interstitial lung disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114Vrv8F]. Respiratory Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The connective-tissue diseases (CTD) are commonly associated with initial or subsequent interstitial lung disease, frequently portending greater morbidity than CTD without lung involvement. While nearly all CTD may be associated with ILD, systemic sclerosis (SSc), the idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM), and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) report the highest prevalences. Radiologic patterns and clinical manifestations vary according to subtype while pulmonary function is frequently characterized by restrictive ventilatory defect and reduced diffusing capacity. Therapy for the majority of CTD-ILD often involves an extension of medications already aimed at the underlying CTD, typically consisting of corticosteroids and steroid-sparing agents like cyclophosphamide (CYC), azathioprine (AZA), and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). Except for scleroderma-ILD, management of CTD-ILD remains experiential or empiric due to lack of robust randomized controlled trials (RCT). Heterogeneity of disease subtypes, unclear and variable outcome measures, and relatively better survival compared to other progressive ILD like idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) make large controlled studies difficult, requiring expansive RCTs with longer durations to differentiate functional or survival outcomes. Pulmonary function endpoints are often followed as reasonable markers of treatment effect.

Rituximab (RTX), a B-cell depleting chimeric monoclonal antibody against human CD20, is currently approved for the treatment of lymphoma and RA. With prior evidence suggesting aberrations in lymphocyte function may be involved in the development and evolution of CTD, its use for the treatment of other CTD subtypes has gained recent interest. An initial report in 2008 involving patients with SSc-ILD supported its particular role in CTD with associated ILD, particularly those with clinically severe or progressive lung disease unresponsive to conventional immunosuppression. Multiple case reports, case series, and one clinical trial have reported on the positive effects of rituximab in CTD-ILD though the extent of its effect on measured pulmonary function has not been summatively reported. This systematic review and meta-analysis summarizes the pooled effect size of RTX on lung function (percent predicted forced vital capacity (FVC%) and diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO%)) and describes reported safety outcomes in the treatment of CTD-ILD.

### Usefulness of monitoring mycophenolic acid exposure in systemic sclerosis-related interstitial lung disease: a retrospective cohort study [^111MrWt4]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

We have identified for the first time, an association between MPA exposure and outcomes in SSc-ILD. Optimal MMF exposure, as indicated by MPA-RR above 1.5 mg/L appears to be a protective factor against FVC worsening. Thus, the routine monitoring of MPA exposure, for a better adaptation of MMF dose, may offer clinical benefits to patients. Future prospective, multicenter studies with larger sample sizes are warranted to further explore pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationships in SSc and to optimize methods for measuring MPA plasma exposure.

### Mycophenolate mofetil improves lung function in connective tissue disease-associated interstitial lung disease [^114zaZXr]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Small series suggest mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is well tolerated and may be an effective therapy for connective tissue disease-associated interstitial lung disease (CTD-ILD). We examined the tolerability and longitudinal changes in pulmonary physiology in a large and diverse cohort of patients with CTD-ILD treated with MMF.

Methods

We identified consecutive patients evaluated at our center between January 2008 and January 2011 and prescribed MMF for CTD-ILD. We assessed safety and tolerability of MMF and used longitudinal data analyses to examine changes in pulmonary physiology over time, before and after initiation of MMF.

Results

We identified 125 subjects treated with MMF for a median 897 days. MMF was discontinued in 13 subjects. MMF was associated with significant improvements in estimated percentage of predicted forced vital capacity (FVC%) from MMF initiation to 52, 104, and 156 weeks (4.9% ± 1.9%, p = 0.01; 6.1% ± 1.8%, p = 0.0008; and 7.3% ± 2.6%, p = 0.004, respectively); and in estimated percentage predicted diffusing capacity (DLCO%) from MMF initiation to 52 and 104 weeks (6.3% ± 2.8%, p = 0.02; 7.1% ± 2.8%, p = 0.01). In the subgroup without usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP)-pattern injury, MMF significantly improved FVC% and DLCO%, and in the subgroup with UIP-pattern injury, MMF was associated with stability in FVC% and DLCO%.

Conclusion

In a large diverse cohort of CTD-ILD, MMF was well tolerated and had a low rate of discontinuation. Treatment with MMF was associated with either stable or improved pulmonary physiology over a median 2.5 years of followup. MMF appears to be a promising therapy for the spectrum of CTD-ILD.

### Expert consensus on the management of systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease [^114g5ZXz]. Respiratory Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a rare, complex connective tissue disease of unknown etiology characterized by microvascular damage, dysregulation of innate and adaptive immunity, and generalized fibrosis in the skin and multiple internal organs. It can target many organ systems, including the skin, lungs, heart, blood vessels, kidneys, gastrointestinal tract, and musculoskeletal system. While the pathogenesis of SSc is not well understood, hallmarks include inflammation, vasculopathy, and fibroblast dysfunction. Risk factors associated with the development of and/or progression of ILD include male sex, African-American race, diffuse cutaneous SSc (dcSSc), presence of anti-Scl-70/anti-topoisomerase I antibodies, and cardiac involvement.

Interstitial lung disease (ILD) occurs in 35–52% of patients with SSc and accounts for 20–40% of mortality. The risk of developing ILD is greatest early in the course of SSc, and timely detection is important for monitoring progression and informing therapeutic decision-making. A European consensus statement identified chest high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) as the primary diagnostic tool for SSc-ILD, supported by pulmonary function tests (PFTs) for screening and diagnosis. Declining values for forced vital capacity (FVC) and diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DL CO) can suggest progression of ILD.

The European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) guidelines for the management of SSc recommend cyclophosphamide (CYC) for the treatment of SSc-ILD. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation may also be considered in patients with rapidly progressive SSc at risk of organ failure, although careful selection of patients is required due to a high risk of treatment-related side effects and mortality. Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) provides similar efficacy to CYC and is associated with less toxicity. For patients who do not respond to treatment, lung transplantation may be a life-saving option.

Antifibrotic drugs represent another class that may be considered a potential treatment option for SSc-ILD based on their efficacy in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a condition with pathogenic similarities. Nintedanib has been approved for the treatment of SSc-ILD and chronic fibrosing ILDs with a progressive phenotype based on the results of the SENSCIS and INBUILD trials respectively; pirfenidone is currently under evaluation. In addition, tocilizumab (TCZ), an inhibitor of interleukin-6, has recently been approved for the treatment of SSc-ILD based on the results of the focuSSced trial.

### Mycophenolate and azathioprine efficacy in interstitial lung disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113vQF5P]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a diverse group of conditions that affect the interstitial structure of the lungs. These diseases can be characterised by progressive lung damage, resulting in symptoms such as dyspnoea, decreased exercise tolerance and a diminished quality of life. Forced vital capacity (FVC) and the diffusion lung capacity of carbon monoxide (DL CO) are widely used to assess the severity of disease and predict prognosis of people with ILD.

Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and azathioprine (AZA) are two immunomodulatory drugs commonly used in the treatment of connective tissue disease (CTD) and associated ILD (CTD-ILD). MMF works by blocking the de novo synthesis of DNA, thereby inhibiting the proliferation of lymphocytes. AZA is a purine analogue that hinders purine synthesis and becomes incorporated into DNA during the anabolic process. Similar to MMF, this mechanism of action makes both drugs more specific for targeting lymphocytes, as lymphocytes do not have a salvage pathway in DNA synthesis.

There is limited evidence for the safety or efficacy of MMF or AZA in improving outcomes for people with ILD. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to assess whether the administration of MMF or AZA in ILD is associated with changes in pulmonary function and gas transfer, and to synthesise evidence of safety profiles.

### Treatment of systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease: evidence-based recommendations. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^116aQscX]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The above recommendations were not assessed as a stepwise algorithm. Clinicians are encouraged to use these recommendations in conjunction with shared decision-making with patients, incorporating side effects and personal values and preferences before administration.

Although the committee sought to differentiate SSc-ILD by initial diagnosis, stable SSc-ILD, and progressive SSc-ILD for each research question, disease status could not be extracted from any of the studies included in the systematic reviews. In addition, high-quality data were not available to assess the treatment effect for mycophenolate and cyclophosphamide by drug formulation or route of administration, respectively. Finally, the questions addressed by this guideline did not focus on comparing one therapeutic option against others. Therefore, the committee felt that a prescriptive decision tree would not be appropriate for this patient population with the evidence that was available.

While an algorithm for different options among the several treatment regimens available is what clinicians are looking for in a guideline, such an approach is ideal only if the evidence permits us to provide this approach. Because of the lack of data to support a preferential and/or stepwise approach to treatment interventions for SSc-ILD, the committee provided the scientific information as it unfolded in the careful review of the evidence to date to inform the treatment recommendations. The committee refrained from providing an algorithmic approach to treatment of SSc-ILD that would have been based solely on a consensus of opinions of the committee and not evidence based.

In addition to the limitations in the evidence, the committee also acknowledges the highly variable adverse event profiles, making it less than ideal to provide a hierarchical recommendation for these medications. Instead, the committee evaluated the medications independently, as some patients may prefer one over another based on their adverse effect profiles, pill burden, routes of administration, and/or costs. The committee believes the current approach in fact empowers the clinician to craft an algorithm tailored to the clinician's opinion in partnership with the well-informed patient.

This guideline aims to serve as a starting point to highlight gaps in evidence to encourage future research into topics and comparisons that can then provide more prescriptive guidance. Further research is therefore needed to determine treatment efficacy, safety, and impact on patient QoL by disease status to determine if there exists a differential treatment effect going from initial diagnosis of SSc-ILD to development of progressive SSc-ILD. Furthermore, additional studies looking at combination therapy and the sequence of initiating each therapy would be of clinical benefit.

### Usefulness of monitoring mycophenolic acid exposure in systemic sclerosis-related interstitial lung disease: a retrospective cohort study [^111m93z4]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design and population

We conducted a retrospective monocentric study in the department of respiratory medicine of hospital Nord in Marseille, France between January 2010 and February 2024. In our hospital, SSc-ILD patients treated with MMF are monitored by RR in routine clinical practice. To be eligible, patients had to fulfill ACR/EULAR criteria for SSc with ILD assessed by an expert radiologist in Multidisciplinary Discussion (MDD), to receive MMF (Cellcept® or Myfortic®) and to have a measurement of MPA-RR. All patients included in the analysis underwent PFTs and High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the lungs after MMF initiation.

The Institutional Review Board of the French learned society for respiratory medicine -Société de Pneumologie de Langue Française- approved the protocol (CEPRO 2023–014), and a written information and non-objection notice was given to all participants according to French law.

### Mycophenolate mofetil versus placebo for systemic sclerosis-related interstitial lung disease: an analysis of scleroderma lung studies I and II [^112wsRPe]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) with placebo for the treatment of systemic sclerosis (SSc)-related interstitial lung disease (ILD).

Methods

We included participants enrolled in the placebo arm of Scleroderma Lung Study (SLS) I and the MMF arm of SLS II. SLS I randomized participants to receive either oral cyclophosphamide (CYC) or placebo for 1 year, while SLS II randomized participants to receive either MMF for 2 years or oral CYC for 1 year followed by 1 year of placebo. Eligibility criteria for SLS I and SLS II were nearly identical. The primary outcome was % predicted forced vital capacity (FVC), and key secondary outcomes included % predicted diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLco), the modified Rodnan skin thickness score (MRSS), and dyspnea. Joint models were created to evaluate the treatment effect on the course of these outcomes over 2 years.

Results

At baseline, the MMF-treated group in SLS II (n = 69) and the placebo-treated group in SLS I (n = 79) had similar percentages of men and women and similar disease duration, SSc subtype, extent of skin disease, and % predicted FVC. MMF-treated patients in SLS II were slightly older (mean ± SD age 52.6 ± 9.7 years versus 48.1 ± 12.4 years; P = 0.0152) and had higher % predicted DLco (mean ± SD 54.0 ± 11.1 versus 46.2 ± 13.3; P = 0.0002) than placebo-treated patients in SLS I. After adjustment for baseline disease severity, treatment with MMF in comparison with placebo was associated with improved % predicted FVC (P < 0.0001), % predicted DLco (P < 0.0001), MRSS (P < 0.0001), and dyspnea (P = 0.0112) over 2 years.

Conclusion

Although there are inherent limitations in comparing participants from different trials, treatment with MMF was associated with improvements in physiologic outcomes and dyspnea compared with placebo, even after accounting for baseline disease severity. These results further substantiate the use of MMF for the treatment of SSc-related ILD.

### Interstitial lung disease: a review [^113YjMYr]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Interstitial lung disease (ILD) consists of a group of pulmonary disorders characterized by inflammation and/or fibrosis of the lung parenchyma associated with progressive dyspnea that frequently results in end-stage respiratory failure. In the US, ILD affects approximately 650 000 people and causes approximately 25 000 to 30 000 deaths per year.

Observations

The most common forms of ILD are idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), which accounts for approximately one-third of all cases of ILD, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, accounting for 15% of ILD cases, and connective tissue disease (CTD), accounting for 25% of ILD cases. ILD typically presents with dyspnea on exertion. Approximately 30% of patients with ILD report cough. Thoracic computed tomography is approximately 91% sensitive and 71% specific for diagnosing subtypes of ILDs such as IPF. Physiologic assessment provides important prognostic information. A 5% decline in forced vital capacity (FVC) over 12 months is associated with an approximately 2-fold increase in mortality compared with no change in FVC. Antifibrotic therapy with nintedanib or pirfenidone slows annual FVC decline by approximately 44% to 57% in individuals with IPF, scleroderma associated ILD, and in those with progressive pulmonary fibrosis of any cause. For connective tissue disease-associated ILD, immunomodulatory therapy, such as tocilizumab, rituximab, and mycophenolate mofetil, may slow decline or even improve FVC at 12-month follow-up. Structured exercise therapy reduces symptoms and improves 6-minute walk test distance in individuals with dyspnea. Oxygen reduces symptoms and improves quality of life in individuals with ILD who desaturate below 88% on a 6-minute walk test. Lung transplant may improve symptoms and resolve respiratory failure in patients with end-stage ILD. After lung transplant, patients with ILD have a median survival of 5.2 to 6.7 years compared with a median survival of less than 2 years in patients with advanced ILD who do not undergo lung transplant. Up to 85% of individuals with end-stage fibrotic ILD develop pulmonary hypertension. In these patients, treatment with inhaled treprostinil improves walking distance and respiratory symptoms.

Conclusions and Relevance

Interstitial lung disease typically presents with dyspnea on exertion and can progress to respiratory failure. First-line therapy includes nintedanib or pirfenidone for IPF and mycophenolate mofetil for ILD due to connective tissue disease. Lung transplant should be considered for patients with advanced ILD. In patients with ILD, exercise training improves 6-minute walk test distance and quality of life.

### Treatment of systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease: evidence-based recommendations. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^113pfq7y]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background: Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc). To date, clinical practice guidelines regarding treatment for patients with SSc-ILD are primarily consensus based. Methods: An international expert guideline committee composed of 24 individuals with expertise in rheumatology, SSc, pulmonology, ILD, or methodology, and with personal experience with SSc-ILD, discussed systematic reviews of the published evidence assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach. Predetermined conflict-of-interest management strategies were applied, and recommendations were made for or against specific treatment interventions exclusively by the nonconflicted panelists. The confidence in effect estimates, importance of outcomes studied, balance of desirable and undesirable consequences of treatment, cost, feasibility, acceptability of the intervention, and implications for health equity were all considered in making the recommendations. This was in accordance with the American Thoracic Society guideline development process, which is in compliance with the Institute of Medicine standards for trustworthy guidelines. Results: For treatment of patients with SSc-ILD, the committee: 1) recommends the use of mycophenolate; 2) recommends further research into the safety and efficacy of (a) pirfenidone and (b) the combination of pirfenidone plus mycophenolate; and 3) suggests the use of (a) cyclophosphamide, (b) rituximab, (c) tocilizumab, (d) nintedanib, and (e) the combination of nintedanib plus mycophenolate. Conclusions: The recommendations herein provide an evidence-based clinical practice guideline for the treatment of patients with SSc-ILD and are intended to serve as the basis for informed and shared decision making by clinicians and patients.

### Mycophenolate and azathioprine efficacy in interstitial lung disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113s6ghw]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2024). High credibility.

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC

Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and azathioprine (AZA) are two immunomodulatory drugs used in the treatment of connective tissue disease with both drugs having mechanisms that target lymphocytes. While increasingly used in treatment of interstitial lung disease (ILD), there is limited evidence for the efficacy of MMF or AZA in improving outcomes.

### Long-term treatment with azathioprine and mycophenolate mofetil for myositis-related interstitial lung disease [^1177drKr]. Chest (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The efficacy of azathioprine (AZA) and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) for interstitial lung disease (ILD) has been described, but mainly in connective tissue disease-associated ILD. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of AZA and MMF on lung function and prednisone dose in myositis-related ILD (M-ILD).

Methods

In this retrospective study, patients with M-ILD seen at Johns Hopkins and treated with AZA or MMF and no other steroid-sparing agents were included. Linear mixed-effects models adjusted for sex, age, antisynthetase antibody, and smoking status were used to compare the change in FVC % predicted, diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (Dlco) % predicted, and prednisone dose.

Results

Sixty-six patients with M-ILD were treated with AZA and 44 with MMF. At treatment initiation, mean FVC % predicted and Dlco % predicted were significantly lower in the AZA group than in the MMF group. In both groups, FVC % predicted improved and the prednisone dose was reduced over 2 to 5 years; however, for Dlco % predicted, only the AZA group improved. The adjusted model showed no significant difference in posttreatment FVC % predicted or Dlco % predicted between groups (mean difference of 1.9 and -8.2, respectively), but a 6.6-mg lower dose of prednisone at 36 months in the AZA group. Adverse events were more frequent with AZA than MMF (33.3% vs 13.6%; p = 0.04).

Conclusions

In M-ILD, AZA treatment was associated with improved FVC % predicted and Dlco % predicted, and lower prednisone dose. Patients treated with MMF had improved FVC % predicted and lower prednisone dose. After 36 months, patients treated with AZA received a lower prednisone dose than those treated with MMF.

Future research opportunities

The committee noted that in clinical practice mycophenolate is used more frequently than cyclophosphamide because of a more favorable side effect profile with mycophenolate. The committee acknowledges that this applies to countries where both medications are accessible and may not be the case in countries where mycophenolate access is limited. In addition, it was noted that most beneficial effects of cyclophosphamide treatment waned 1 year after cessation of cyclophosphamide treatment. Further research is needed to determine treatment duration for disease-modifying therapies for SSc-ILD. Future research should also assess the use of cyclophosphamide in patients with an initial diagnosis of SSc-ILD, in stable SSc-ILD, and in progressive SSc-ILD, as well as by route of administration (oral vs. intravenous).

Question 2: Should patients with SSc-ILD be treated with mycophenolate?

Background

Given that mycophenolate is an inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase that impairs T and B cell proliferation and is currently used as a standard-of-care treatment for SSc, the committee asked the question, "Should patients with SSc-ILD be treated with mycophenolate?" The committee was interested in the evidence base for the different formulations of mycophenolate, specifically mycophenolate mofetil and mycophenolic acid. Cyclophosphamide, which was the previous standard of care since the publication of SLS I, and placebo were both deemed appropriate comparators. Critical outcomes included mortality and disease progression (defined as changes in FVC, D CO, radiologic disease, and the mRSS, with the latter an indirect measure for progression of disease used primarily for SSc). Important outcomes included quality of life indices (including the Transition Dyspnea Index [TDI]) and adverse events.

Treatment with MMF or CYC was not associated with a change in the HRCT-measured quantitative lung fibrosis (QLF) scores in the lobe of most involvement (QLF-LM) or in the whole lung (QLF-WL), nor was a difference between the two treatment arms identified (Table 2 & Supplementary Table 5, web appendix p 23–24). The same was true for the HRCT quantitative interstitial lung disease (QILD) score in the lobe of maximal involvement (QILD-LM). On the other hand, QILD in the whole lung (QILD-WL) was reduced (improved) to a small degree in both the CYC arm (−2.78; 95% CI: −5.17 to −0.40) and the MMF arm (−2.51; 95% CI: −4.8 to −0.15).

Study drug administration and blinding

Enrolled patients will be randomised on Day 1 of the study in a 1:1 ratio to receive 2403 mg/day pirfenidone or placebo. The randomisation process will be conducted using a validated interactive voice or web-based response system (IxRS). To prevent selection bias and allow subgroup comparison, randomisation will be stratified by use of concomitant mycophenolate mofetil (MMF; including mycophenolate sodium and mycophenolic acid) and presence or absence of IPAF.

Pirfenidone will be administered orally in 267 mg capsules taken with food at the same times each day. The dose of pirfenidone will be titrated over 2 weeks from an initial dose of 801 mg/day during Week 1 (one capsule three times a day) to 1602 mg/day during Week 2 (two capsules three times a day) to a maintenance dose of 2403 mg/day from Week 3 onwards (three capsules three times a day). The dose of pirfenidone used for each individual study participant will be at the discretion of the investigator. Temporary dose reduction, treatment interruption or discontinuation will be considered to manage treatment-emergent adverse events. Treatment will be discontinued in patients who become pregnant, experience hepatic or renal impairment or angioedema or have substantial liver-function test elevations. Patients who are non-adherent with their dosing regimen or titration schedule will be withdrawn from the study.

To ensure blinding of the treatment group to investigators, study participants and the sponsor, study participants randomised to the placebo group will be administered placebo capsules with identical appearance, size and taste to pirfenidone capsules. If unblinding is necessary due to, for example, a serious adverse event, the study investigator will be able to reveal the patient's allocated intervention by contacting the IxRS.

Results

Search of relevant studies

A total of 2831 publications from Embase and Medline were identified. After removal of duplicates and evaluating the titles and abstracts, 23 studies were assessed for eligibility. Among these, 11 studies were excluded due to retrospective design (n = 2), incompleteness (n = 2), lack of the outcome of interest (n = 2) or the presence of concomitant treatment with high doses of steroids (n = 5) (figure 1, online supplemental table 1). A total of 13 studies were eligible for qualitative synthesis (table 1). Separately, four ongoing MMF studies were identified, including one phase II RCT, two open-label trials and one prospective cohort study; two studies address pulmonary involvement of systemic sclerosis, one study recruits participants with fibrotic hypersensitivity pneumonitis and one study focuses on idiopathic inflammatory myopathy ILD (online supplemental document 3).

Risk of bias

A moderate risk of bias was observed for the blinding of outcome assessment in all the included RCTs, as there were no mentioned strategies to blind the pulmonary function test evaluations (figure 2A). Roig et al and Zhang et al were considered at high risk of bias in terms of blinding of participants and personnel, as they compared intravenous and oral (per os) treatments without implementing a double dummy strategy. Due to the high risks of bias across a number of domains and insufficient data reporting, the study by Roig et al was excluded from quantitative synthesis. In the assessment of prospective observational studies, six studieshad selection bias in the ascertainment of exposure, but all studies were considered adequate (figure 2B, online supplemental table 2).

### Treatment of systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease: evidence-based recommendations. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^11768Y2T]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Justification and implementation considerations

The committee decided to make a conditional recommendation for nintedanib in patients with SSc-ILD, balancing the significant reduction in disease progression against gastrointestinal adverse events, which can be managed with medication discontinuation, and low-quality evidence attributable to the limited number of randomized studies and primarily post hoc data analysis. It is worth noting that a recent guideline suggested the use of nintedanib for non-IPF PPF, including progressive SSc-ILD. Our recommendation broadens that suggestion to include all patients with SSc-ILD, regardless of whether their disease is progressive or stable. This reflects the observation that relevant trials found a benefit from nintedanib in heterogeneous populations of SSc-ILD. The trials did not distinguish those with progressive disease from those with stable disease; therefore, it is possible that 1) the modest benefit in all patients with SSc-ILD is the net effect of a large benefit in progressive SSc-ILD and no benefit in stable SSc-ILD; or 2) there is a benefit in patients with stable SSc-ILD through prevention of progression in those who are destined to eventually progress.

Future research opportunities

Future research should assess the use of nintedanib in patients with an initial diagnosis of SSc-ILD, in stable SSc-ILD, and in progressive SSc-ILD to discriminate its effect in stable versus progressive disease.

Question 6: Should patients with SSc-ILD be treated with nintedanib plus mycophenolate?

Background

For SSc-ILD, it is unknown if combining therapies with different mechanisms of action is preferable to individual agents and, if dual therapy is preferred, what is the combination of choice. The use of mycophenolate has demonstrated improvement in the absolute FVC % predicted over time, whereas nintedanib has been shown to reduce the rate of disease progression compared with placebo in patients with SSc-ILD. Therefore, the committee addressed the question, "Should patients with SSc-ILD be treated with nintedanib plus mycophenolate?" The committee remained interested in the evidence base for the different formulations of mycophenolate, specifically mycophenolate mofetil and mycophenolic acid, but these data were not ascertainable. Appropriate comparators to combination therapy included placebo, mycophenolate only, or nintedanib only. Critical outcomes included disease progression (including changes in FVC, D CO, or radiographic disease) and mortality. Important outcomes included quality of life (using the SGRQ) and adverse events.

Systemic sclerosis–associated interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD) — mycophenolate recommendation and evidence: "We recommend using mycophenolate to treat patients with SSc-ILD (strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence)", with committee votes "14 of 18 (78%)" strongly in favor and "4 of 18 (22%)" conditionally in favor, and no votes to not consider it ("0 of 18 (0%)" for conditional or strong) and "No guideline participants (0%) abstained from this vote". Compared with placebo, disease progression favored mycophenolate with FVC % predicted showing "about a 3.5% difference between the two arms" at "12 and 24 months", the rate of overall FVC improvement at 12 and 24 months "was nearly 2.3-fold higher", and mean change in DlCO % predicted "was > 4% less at both 12 and 24 months", while versus cyclophosphamide there were "no differences" in mean change in FVC or DlCO at "12 or 24 months". Mortality showed "no significant difference in mortality at 24 months" versus placebo or cyclophosphamide; breathlessness "at all time points, including 24 months, favored mycophenolate over placebo", and "changes in the mRSS favored mycophenolate". Adverse events included a "ninefold increased risk of anemia" versus placebo, whereas compared with cyclophosphamide mycophenolate had a "41% lower risk of premature discontinuation of therapy for any reason and 86% lower risk of leukopenia".

### Mycophenolate mofetil versus oral cyclophosphamide in scleroderma-related interstitial lung disease (SLS II): a randomised controlled, double-blind, parallel group trial [^116hxBCT]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Summary

BACKGROUND

Twelve months of oral cyclophosphamide (CYC) has been shown to alter the progression of scleroderma-related interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD) when compared to placebo. However, toxicity was a concern and without continued treatment the efficacy disappeared by 24 months. We hypothesized that a two-year course of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) would be safer, better tolerated and produce longer lasting improvements than CYC.

METHODS

Patients with SSc-ILD meeting defined dyspnea, pulmonary function and high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) criteria were randomized in a double-blind, two-arm trial at 14 medical centers. MMF (target dose 1500 mg twice daily) was administered for 24 months in one arm and oral CYC (target dose 2.0 mg/kg/day) administered for 12 months followed by placebo for 12 months in the other arm. The primary endpoint, change in forced vital capacity as a percent of the predicted normal value (FVC %) over the course of 24 months, was assessed in a modified intention-to-treat analysis using an inferential joint model combining a mixed effects model for longitudinal outcomes and a survival model to handle non-ignorable missing data. The study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00883129, and is closed.

RESULTS

Between November, 2009, and January, 2013, 142 patients were randomized. 126 patients (63 MMF; 63 CYC) with acceptable baseline HRCT studies and at least one outcome measure were included in the analysis. The adjusted FVC % (primary endpoint) improved from baseline to 24 months by 2.17 in the MMF arm (95% CI, 0.53–3.84) and 2.86 in the CYC arm (95% confidence interval 1.19–4.58) with no significant between-treatment difference (p = 0.24), indicating that the trial was negative for the primary endpoint. However, in a post-hoc analysis of the primary endpoint, within-treatment improvements from baseline to 24 months were noted in both the CYC and MMF arms. A greater number of patients on CYC than on MMF prematurely withdrew from study drug (32 vs 20) and failed treatment (2 vs 0), and the time to stopping treatment was significantly shorter in the CYC arm (p = 0.019). Sixteen deaths occurred (11 CYC; 5 MMF) with most due to progressive ILD. Leukopenia (30 vs 4 patients) and thrombocytopenia (4 vs 0 patients) occurred more often in patients treated with CYC. In post-hoc analyses, within- (but not between-) treatment improvements were also noted in defined secondary outcomes including skin score, dyspnea and whole-lung HRCT scores.

INTERPRETATION

Treatment of SSc-ILD with MMF for two years or CYC for one year both resulted in significant improvements in pre-specified measures of lung function, dyspnea, lung imaging, and skin disease over the 2-year course of the study. While MMF was better tolerated and associated with less toxicity, the hypothesis that it would have greater efficacy at 24 months than CYC was not confirmed. These findings support the potential clinical impact of both CYC and MMF for progressive SSc-ILD, as well as the current preference for MMF due to its better tolerability and toxicity profile.

### Mycophenolate mofetil versus oral cyclophosphamide in scleroderma-related interstitial lung disease (SLS II): a randomised controlled, double-blind, parallel group trial [^1156K2Li]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Background

12 months of oral cyclophosphamide has been shown to alter the progression of scleroderma-related interstitial lung disease when compared with placebo. However, toxicity was a concern and without continued treatment the efficacy disappeared by 24 months. We hypothesised that a 2 year course of mycophenolate mofetil would be safer, better tolerated, and produce longer lasting improvements than cyclophosphamide.

Methods

This randomised, double-blind, parallel group trial enrolled patients from 14 US medical centres with scleroderma-related interstitial lung disease meeting defined dyspnoea, pulmonary function, and high-resolution CT (HRCT) criteria. The data coordinating centre at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA, CA, USA), randomly assigned patients using a double-blind, double-dummy, centre-blocked design to receive either mycophenolate mofetil (target dose 1500 mg twice daily) for 24 months or oral cyclophosphamide (target dose 2.0 mg/kg per day) for 12 months followed by placebo for 12 months. Drugs were given in matching 250 mg gel capsules. The primary endpoint, change in forced vital capacity as a percentage of the predicted normal value (FVC %) over the course of 24 months, was assessed in a modified intention-to-treat analysis using an inferential joint model combining a mixed-effects model for longitudinal outcomes and a survival model to handle non-ignorable missing data. The study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00883129.

Findings

Between Sept 28, 2009, and Jan 14, 2013, 142 patients were randomly assigned to either mycophenolate mofetil (n = 69) or cyclophosphamide (n = 73). 126 patients (mycophenolate mofetil [n = 63] and cyclophosphamide [n = 63]) with acceptable baseline HRCT studies and at least one outcome measure were included in the primary analysis. The adjusted % predicted FVC improved from baseline to 24 months by 2.19 in the mycophenolate mofetil group (95% CI 0.53–3.84) and 2.88 in the cyclophosphamide group (1.19–4.58). The course of the % FVC did not differ significantly between the two treatment groups based on the prespecified primary analysis using a joint model (p = 0.24), indicating that the trial was negative for the primary endpoint. However, in a post-hoc analysis of the primary endpoint, the within-treatment change from baseline to 24 months derived from the joint model showed that the % FVC improved significantly in both the mycophenolate mofetil and cyclophosphamide groups. 16 (11%) patients died (five [7%] mycophenolate mofetil and 11 [15%] cyclophosphamide), with most due to progressive interstitial lung disease. Leucopenia (30 patients vs four patients) and thrombocytopenia (four vs zero) occurred more often in patients given cyclophosphamide than mycophenolate mofetil. Fewer patients on mycophenolate mofetil than on cyclophosphamide prematurely withdrew from study drug (20 vs 32) or met prespecified criteria for treatment failure (zero vs two). The time to stopping treatment was shorter in the cyclophosphamide group (p = 0.019).

Interpretation

Treatment of scleroderma-related interstitial lung disease with mycophenolate mofetil for 2 years or cyclophosphamide for 1 year both resulted in significant improvements in prespecified measures of lung function over the 2 year course of the study. Although mycophenolate mofetil was better tolerated and associated with less toxicity, the hypothesis that it would have greater efficacy at 24 months than cyclophosphamide was not confirmed. These findings support the potential clinical effectiveness of both cyclophosphamide and mycophenolate mofetil for progressive scleroderma-related interstitial lung disease, and the present preference for mycophenolate mofetil because of its better tolerability and toxicity profile.

Discussion

This Delphi study was initiated to develop consensus recommendations for screening, treatment criteria, and the potential role of antifibrotic drugs in patients with SSc-ILD, building on the latest EULAR scleroderma treatment guidelines and the European consensus statement. The relatively low percentage of statements reaching consensus is reflective of the uncertainty amongst physicians on the appropriate management of SSc-ILD. Nevertheless, the findings from this study provide an algorithm to support effective management of ILD in patients with SSc (Fig. 7), currently the leading cause of death in this population.

Risk of bias

Two authors (FL and LF) independently used the Cochrane 'Risk of Bias' assessment tool 2.0 to evaluate the included RCTs prior to quantitative synthesis. Risk of bias in the observational prospective studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale. To assess the risk of bias in single-arm observational cohorts, specifically for evaluation of 'selection bias' and 'comparative bias' on the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale, baseline time points were considered as the 'not exposed cohort' and the follow-up time point as the 'exposed cohort'. Studies that were determined to have a high risk of bias were excluded from quantitative synthesis.

Statistical analysis

When two or more studies were available for a specific treatment, a random effects meta-analysis with inverse-variance was performed to evaluate the effect of the treatment on %FVC and %DL CO values. Estimates were expressed as weighted mean difference (WMD) with 95% CI.

Where there were sufficient RCT data, the primary endpoint analysis assessed the delta difference in %FVC and %DL CO at follow-up from baseline in respiratory function for MMF or AZA relative to the comparator. In a secondary endpoint analysis, the difference in %FVC and %DL CO between follow-up and baseline in people receiving of MMF or AZA was compared. Analyses were performed according to drug, prespecified subgroup analyses were performed according to study design (RCT or prospective observation study) and follow-up time (6 months or 12 months and over).

Heterogeneity was evaluated using I 2 statistic to interpret the proportion of the total variability that was due to between-study heterogeneity, as well as inspection of forest plots. All analyses were performed by using Stata SE V.17.0.

Assessment of certainty of evidence

The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to assess the certainty of evidence in effect estimates from RCT data exclusively. The level of certainty was evaluated as high, moderate, low or very low, considering factors of risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision and publication bias. Publication bias was inspected with asymmetry in funnel plots and Egger's test.

Patient and public involvement

Pharmacological treatment

Historically, immunosuppressants have been considered the cornerstone of therapy for patients with ILDs other than IPF, irrespectively of the radiologic or histologic pattern. The degree of evidence for the available immunomodulatory drugs in the specific inflammatory rheumatic diseases such as corticosteroids, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), azathioprine, methotrexate, cyclophosphamide and rituximab are sparse, except in SSc even though these therapies are often employed. However, a recent retrospective study, in patients with RA who started treatment for ILD with mycophenolate, azathioprine, or rituximab, observed that immunosuppression was associated with an improved trajectory in FVC and DLCO compared with the pretreatment pulmonary function trajectory, regardless of the kind of drug. Interestingly, patients with a UIP pattern of ILD in immunosuppressive treatment did not show a worse pulmonary function trajectory as compared with patients with a non-UIP ILD.

The recent demonstration of efficacy of the antifibrotic drug nintedanib in progressive fibrosing ILDs other than IPF has introduced a new therapeutic approach to ARD-ILD supplementary to those already used.

Recently, official clinical practice guidelines for the management of IPF and PPF in adults have been developed. Therefore, the ILD subset, mainly the radiological/histological pattern and the degree of fibrotic component, other than the clinical behaviour of ILD, is becoming increasingly important when determining the therapeutic strategy also for patients with ARD-ILD.

The two antifibrotic drugs nintedanib and pirfenidone were proposed for the treatment of these patients with different degrees of evidence.

Nintedanib acts as a triple tyrosine kinase inhibitor, simultaneously inhibiting signaling pathways activated by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), as well as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). In contrast, the exact mechanism of action of pirfenidone is not fully understood. It is suggested that the antioxidant effects of pirfenidone contribute to its anti-inflammatory effects, leading to antifibrotic effects. Pirfenidone attenuates the production of transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), a key profibrotic and pro-inflammatory cytokine implicated in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Some evidence also suggests that pirfenidone downregulates pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF).

### Usefulness of monitoring mycophenolic acid exposure in systemic sclerosis-related interstitial lung disease: a retrospective cohort study [^1172t2Px]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) is a rare connective tissue disease characterized by microvascular damage and remodeling with fibroblasts activation and extra-cellular matrix synthesis. Organs involved can be the skin, heart, kidney, muscles, articulations and lungs. Lung involvement is frequent in SSc, indeed, pulmonary fibrosis had been showed in 70 to 100% in autopsy series. Furthermore, up to 50% of patients present significant clinical lung involvement making SSc related interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD) a major determinant of prognosis and quality of life. Currently, interstitial lung disease is the most common cause of death among these patients.

Immunosuppressive therapy (IS) for SSc-ILD is indicated for severe or worsening ILD based on international guidelines. In SSc-ILD, according to the Scleroderma lung study II, MMF can be used as first line-therapy or as maintenance therapy after Cyclophosphamide (CYC). MMF belongs to the anti-metabolite family and exhibits a complex pharmacokinetics. MMF is hydrolyzed by carboxylesterases in the active component, mycophenolic acid (MPA) in the stomach and absorbed. It is used in several diseases such as Solid Organ Transplantation (SOT), Systemic Lupus erythematous (SLE) or chronic graft versus host disease (GvHD). Plasma concentration has already been investigated in these diseases but not in SSc whereas MMF is now an established therapy. Plasma concentrations should range between 30–60 mg/h/L in SOT and at least 35 and 30 mg/h/L respectively in SLE and GvHD. In SSc, the target dose of 3 grammes of MMF has shown equivalent efficacy as CYC against ILD. Furthermore, in SSc there are considerable MMF inter-individual variations in drug exposure and concentration: higher concentrations are found in female patients, patients with poor renal function, low body weight, whereas lower concentrations are observed in proton pump inhibitor (PPI) users or overweight patient. Gastro-intestinal disorders, frequently observed in SSc patients may also cause a variation of the MMF concentration.

### Management of systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease [^113UFuHx]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To review the recently published data and provide a practical overview for management of systemic sclerosis-interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD).

Recent Findings

Published evidence shows considerable practitioner variability in screening patients for ILD. Recent published data support use of cyclophosphamide or mycophenolate mofetil as first-line treatment of SSc-ILD. For patients not responding to first-line therapies, consideration is given to rituximab as rescue therapy. Recent trials of hematopoietic autologous stem cell transplantation have demonstrated benefit in patients with progressive SSc-ILD. Antifibrotic agents are approved in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis; studies with antifibrotics are underway for SSc-ILD.

Summary

The specter of rapidly progressive lung disease requires clinicians to risk stratify patients according to known predictors for progression and rigorously monitor for symptoms and advancing disease. The abovementioned therapies promise improved efficacy and favorable side-effect profiles compared to cyclophosphamide.

The potential role of antifibrotic drugs

When asked how the panel's treatment choices for patients with SSc-ILD have changed since publication of the SENSCIS, INBUILD, and focuSSced trial results, 77% mentioned that they had increased their use of nintedanib or antifibrotics, while 45% mentioned that they now use or would consider using TCZ.

Antifibrotic drugs in general were considered potential therapeutic options based on a decline in PFTs and/or HRCT, and it was recommended that they should be used in combination with or after MMF/CYC. Following the results of the SENSCIS and INBUILD trials, the panelists reached consensus that nintedanib specifically was a therapeutic option for patients with progressive fibrotic ILD despite immunosuppressive therapy, both as monotherapy and in combination with MMF/CYC/TCZ, for patients with aggressive ILD (defined as relative FVC decline > 10% in 1 year), with advanced disease at initial presentation (FVC < 50%) in combination with MMF/CYC/TCZ, and for patients with contraindications to or who are unable to tolerate immunosuppression (MMF/CYC/TCZ). There was also consensus that nintedanib could be used to treat patients unable to continue with MMF, CYC, or TCZ due to adverse effects or lack of efficacy with the effective dose (Fig. 4 B, Additional file 1: Table S2). The panelists' consensus was that the decision to include nintedanib in the treatment regimen should be based on lack of an effective response to MMF/CYC/TCZ, defined by a combined lack of improvement in symptoms, HRCT, and/or PFT results, or an active worsening of the patient's condition, defined by worsening of ILD on HRCT, worsening of lung function, or a combination of the two with worsening symptoms.

The potential role of TCZ

Following the results of the focuSSced trial, the panelists agreed that TCZ should be considered in patients with early SSc and ILD with elevated acute-phase reactants. Use of TCZ in patients experiencing worsening on initial therapy did not achieve consensus by the whole group. They also considered TCZ an option for patients unable to continue CYC, MMF, or antifibrotics due to adverse effects. There was no consensus agreement on how TCZ fits into the management of SSc-ILD (Fig. 4 B, Additional file 1: Table S2).

### Ongoing clinical trials and treatment options for patients with systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease [^115zr3fo]. Rheumatology (2019). Medium credibility.

SSc is a rare CTD that affects multiple organ systems, resulting in substantial morbidity and mortality. Evidence of interstitial lung disease (ILD) is seen in ∼80% of patients with SSc. Currently there is no approved disease-modifying treatment for ILD and few effective treatment options are available. CYC is included in treatment guidelines, but it has limited efficacy and is associated with toxicity. MMF is becoming the most commonly used medication in clinical practice in North America and the UK, but its use is not universal. Newer agents targeting the pathogenic mechanisms underlying SSc-ILD, including fibrotic and inflammatory pathways, lymphocytes, cell-cell and cell-extracellular membrane interactions, hold promise for better treatment outcomes, including improved lung function, patient-related outcomes and quality of life. Here we review ongoing trials of established and novel agents that are currently recruiting patients with SSc-ILD.

A sample size of 150, assuming a 30% drop-out rate, was calculated to provide 80% power at the 5% alpha level (2-tailed) to detect a 4% difference between treatment arms at 24 months. A modified intention-to-treat principle was applied to all analyses using an inferential joint model consisting of a mixed effects model for longitudinal outcomes and a survival model to handle non-ignorable missing data due to study dropout, treatment failure or death (i.e. likely related to disease or treatment and therefore not random). Consistent with the intention-to-treat principle, treatment failures and others who prematurely withdrew from the double-blind treatment phase were encouraged to return for outcome monitoring at the 12, 18 and 24 month visits and their outcomes included in the analysis. Pre-specified covariates for the primary outcome included baseline FVC %-predicted, the HRCT-measured extent of lung fibrosis in the lobe of maximal involvement, a time trend, treatment assignment, and treatment-time trend interactions (see web appendix pp 113–115 for statistical details). Secondary efficacy endpoints were also analyzed using a joint model approach (no adjustment for multiple comparisons). For safety and tolerability analyses, Kaplan Meier survival curves were generated for each treatment group with significance determined using a log-rank test. Chi-square or Fisher's exact tests were employed to compare the incidence of AEs and SAEs between treatment arms.

The statistical analyses were performed with SAS software (version 9.2, SAS Institute, Cary, NC) where appropriate. The study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00883129)

Role of the funding source

Roche, the manufacturer of MMF used in the study, donated the drug but had no role in the study design; in the collection, analysis, or interpretation of data; in the writing of the report; or in the decision to submit the manuscript for publication.

### Treatment of systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease: evidence-based recommendations. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^116FEk8a]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The recommendations in this document provide an evidence-based clinical practice guideline for the treatment of patients with SSc-ILD (Figure 1) and are intended to serve as the basis for informed and shared decision making by clinicians and patients. For treatment of patients with SSc-ILD, the committee: 1) recommends the use of mycophenolate; 2) recommends further research into the safety and efficacy of (a) pirfenidone and (b) the combination of pirfenidone plus mycophenolate; and 3) suggests the use of (a) cyclophosphamide, (b) rituximab, (c) tocilizumab, (d) nintedanib, and (e) the combination of nintedanib plus mycophenolate. Future research should investigate the efficacy and safety of these therapies on SSc-ILD subgroups by disease status (initial diagnosis, stable SSc-ILD, and progressive SSc-ILD) and in various combinations. This guideline was reviewed by the ATS Quality Improvement and Implementation Committee. None of the recommendations in this guideline are considered appropriate targets for a performance measure.

### Mycophenolate mofetil for interstitial lung disease in dermatomyositis [^1131cY93]. Arthritis Care & Research (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To report our experience using mycophenolate mofetil as first-line treatment for dermatomyositis-associated interstitial lung disease.

Methods

We examined the medical records of all 16 dermatomyositis patients with interstitial lung disease seen in our outpatient university hospital dermatology clinic between May 26, 2006, and May 25, 2009. In this retrospective case series, we describe the clinical course of the 4 patients with definitive evidence of interstitial lung disease on radiologic imaging who were treated with mycophenolate mofetil and had pulmonary data available to document their outcome. All of the patients also received prednisone.

Results

All 3 patients with at least 1 year of followup receiving mycophenolate mofetil experienced complete normalization of pulmonary function tests (including diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide) and resolution of dyspnea. They were also able to reduce their prednisone doses. The only patient with pre- and posttreatment chest computed tomography imaging had total resolution of her interstitial opacities. The patient with only 5 months of posttreatment followup experienced an improvement in diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide from 44% to 77% predicted, but no change in dyspnea.

Conclusion

These promising data indicate that mycophenolate mofetil may be a useful therapy for interstitial lung disease in patients with dermatomyositis, but larger studies are needed to more definitively evaluate the role of this medication in therapy.

### Etiology, risk factors, and biomarkers in systemic sclerosis with interstitial lung disease [^116ExwFx]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Treatment of SSc-ILD is beyond the scope of this review; however, several landmark studies have indicated that some treatments may be able to stabilize or slow down disease progression and, therefore, improve patient outcomes. All these trials focused on patients with clinically meaningful ILD, defined as a combination of moderate to severe ILD on HRCT and abnormal pulmonary physiology with symptoms. SLS I showed that 12 months of treatment of SSc-ILD with cyclophosphamide (CYC) improved FVC % predicted by 2.53% versus placebo (P < 0.03). A modest benefit was also reported in TLC, dyspnea, skin thickening, and health-related quality of life. SLS II was a 24-month study comparing 2-year treatment with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) with 1 year of treatment with CYC followed by 1 year of placebo in patients with SSc-ILD. The two treatment approaches showed similar efficacy in terms of FVC % predicted (mean improvement of 2.19% and 2.88%, respectively) at 24 months. However, MMF treatment was reported to be better tolerated (e.g. lower rates of leucopenia and thrombocytopenia). The Fibrosing Alveolitis in Scleroderma Trial was a randomized, placebo-controlled study of low-dose prednisolone and six-monthly doses of intravenous CYC and oral azathioprine. Compared with placebo, study intervention showed a nonsignificant trend toward improving FVC (treatment difference, 4.19%; P = 0.08). Recently, nintedanib became the first U.S. Food and Drug Administration–approved treatment for SSc-ILD; it is indicated for slowing the rate of decline in pulmonary function in patients with SSc-associated ILD on the basis of the results of the phase III, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled SENSCIS (Safety and Efficacy of Nintedanib in Systemic Sclerosis) trial. Primary endpoint analysis in the SENSCIS trial showed that the adjusted annual rate of decline in FVC was 52.4 ml/yr in nintedanib-treated patients versus 93.3 ml/yr in placebo-treated patients (difference, 41.0 ml/yr; 95% confidence interval, 2.9–79.0 ml/yr; P = 0.04) over a 1-year period in the total study population. Subgroups analyses reported that nintedanib reduced the progression of ILD irrespective of mycophenolate use at baseline. Statistical testing did not indicate heterogeneity in the treatment effect of nintedanib between those who were or were not receiving mycophenolate at baseline (P = 0.45 for treatment-by-time-by-subgroup interaction). The absolute effect of nintedanib versus placebo in reducing the rate of decline in FVC was numerically lower in patients who were receiving mycophenolate at baseline compared with those who were not receiving mycophenolate at baseline (26.3 ml/yr vs. 55.4 ml/yr). The relative treatment effect of nintedanib was similar between these subgroups (40% and 46%, respectively) and consistent with that observed in the overall population (44%). No other significant clinical benefits were observed.

### Mycophenolate mofetil versus oral cyclophosphamide in scleroderma-related interstitial lung disease (SLS II): a randomised controlled, double-blind, parallel group trial [^113F1U3R]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

In addition to predicting a differential effect of treatment on FVC % over time, part of our primary hypothesis was that MMF would be less toxic and better tolerated. Consistent with this, hematopoietic suppression (specifically leukopenia and thrombocytopenia) occurred in a greater percentage of patients treated with CYC. However, this did not translate into a greater number of pneumonias, infections, SAEs or deaths. In terms of tolerability, a greater proportion of subjects in the CYC arm discontinued the drug prematurely and assignment to CYC was associated with a significantly shorter time to premature withdrawal from study drug. Moreover, most patients in the MMF arm achieved and maintained close to the target dose of MMF, whereas the tolerated dose of CYC declined over time to approximately 75% of the target dose (Supplementary Figure 6, web appendix p 18). The latter findings might have accounted for the apparently slower onset of improvement in FVC % predicted among patients in the CYC arm.

While deaths occurred in approximately twice as many participants in the CYC arm than in the MMF arm, neither the difference in mortality nor the time to death between the two treatments was statistically significant. However, the study was not powered to detect a mortality difference between the two treatment arms.

It is important to consider the particular strengths and weaknesses associated with this trial. As the second large multi-center clinical trial conducted by the SLS Investigators, it builds upon their past experience, extensive training and methods for standardization. We also employed a placebo-controlled RCT design using a unique drug administration protocol that allowed maintenance of blinding while administering two active drugs with different dosing and administration schedules.

On the other hand, potential limitations included the premature withdrawal of a significant proportion of subjects over the 24 month treatment phase (CYC 32/73, 43.8%; MMF 20/69 = 28.9%). However, this was partially mitigated by anticipating a 30% drop-out in the study design and employing a modified joint model in which patients were encouraged to return for study outcome measures even after premature withdrawal from treatment. Indeed, 15 patients in the CYC arm and 4 in the MMF arm who had discontinued their study medication prematurely returned for one or more of the 18–24 month visits and these data were included in the primary analysis. However, as already noted, the majority of these patients received potentially disease-modifying therapy that could have influenced the results. While the joint model was specifically intended to minimize such biases it does not eliminate them.

### Mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine and tacrolimus: mechanisms in rheumatology [^11319A8o]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

The introduction of biologic DMARDs into rheumatology has resulted in a substantial reduction of the burden of many rheumatic diseases. In the slipstream of the success achieved with these biologic DMARDs, some conventional immunosuppressive drugs have also found use in new indications. Notably, mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine and tacrolimus have made their way from solid organ transplantation drugs to become useful assets in rheumatology practice. Mycophenolate mofetil and azathioprine inhibit the purine pathway and subsequently diminish cell proliferation. Both drugs have a pivotal role in the treatment of various rheumatic diseases, including lupus nephritis. Tacrolimus inhibits lymphocyte activation by inhibiting the calcineurin pathway. Mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus are, among other indications, increasingly being recognized as useful drugs in the treatment of interstitial lung disease in systemic rheumatic diseases and skin fibrosis in systemic sclerosis. A broad array of trials with mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine and/or tacrolimus are ongoing within the field of rheumatology that might provide further novel avenues for the use of these drugs. In this Review, we discuss the historical perspective, pharmacodynamics, clinical indications and novel avenues for mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine and tacrolimus in rheumatology.

### Use of mycophenolate mofetil to treat scleroderma-associated interstitial lung disease [^114pFiAF]. Respiratory Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Up to 80% of patients with scleroderma have lung disease, with interstitial lung disease (ILD) being the most common manifestation. Currently, there is no definitive therapy for this condition. The objective of the study is to investigate the use of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) to treat scleroderma interstitial ILD. We report a retrospective chart review of 17 patients with scleroderma ILD treated with MMF (2g/day) for at least 12 months. Demographics, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) findings, pulmonary physiology and high-resolution computed tomography were recorded at baseline and after 12 and 24 months of therapy. Baseline BAL (n = 12) showed alveolitis (median of 18% neutrophils). Ninety-four percent of subjects had either improved or stable lung function after 12 months of treatment: four improved, 12 were stable and only one worsened. All patients had radiographic abnormalities consistent with ILD. After 12 months of therapy, radiological findings (n = 15) were stable in 11 patients, worse in three, and improved in one. There were no side effects attributable to MMF therapy recorded. Treatment of patients with scleroderma ILD for up to 24 months with MMF was generally associated with stable pulmonary function. These data argue for a prospective trial using MMF to treat scleroderma ILD.

### Usefulness of monitoring mycophenolic acid exposure in systemic sclerosis-related interstitial lung disease: a retrospective cohort study [^116LxVm9]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

We created two groups of patients based on their MPA-RR levels at evaluation time: 19 (44%) with RR < 1.5 mg/L and 24 (56%) with RR ≥ 1.5 mg/L. A comparison of baseline characteristics between the two groups is summarized in Table 1. The MMF dose was the only variable with a significant difference between these groups (p -value 0.032), with a higher MMF dose in the ≥ 1.5 mg/L group. Seventeen (40%) patients presented adverse event, mainly digestive, without significant difference between the two groups. Treatments such as CYC, rituximab or antifibrotic drugs, as well as PFTs or duration between MMF introduction and RR measurement, were not statistically different between the two groups.

MMF dose and MPA-RR relationship

The median duration between MMF introduction and RR measurement was 12 months (range 0–112). The median MMF dose and MPA-RR were 1000 mg/day (0.5–3) and 1.7 mg/L (0.5–6.2), respectively. There was a significant positive correlation between MMF dose and MPA-RR using Pearson model (rho: 0.47, p -value 0.002) (Fig. 1).

Patients' evolution

Table 2 compares the evolution of the PFTs, HRCT and clinical outcomes between these two groups. Concerning PFTs, the absolute evolution of FVC was significantly better in RR ≥ 1.5 mg/L group than in lower RR group (p -value 0.024). Indeed, a stabilization of FVC was observed in a higher proportion of patients (n = 17; 74%) in RR ≥ 1.5 mg/L group compared with the RR < 1.5 mg/L group (n = 5; 33%). In addition, a lower proportion of patients experienced a decrease of FVC in the RR ≥ 1.5 mg/L group (n = 3; 13%) versus the RR < 1.5 mg/L group (n = 7; 47%). Figure 2 represents the evolution of mean FVC in patients depending on MPA-RR upper or lower 1.5 mg/L.

6.2 Postmarketing Experience

The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Mycophenolate mofetil. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure:

Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Congenital malformations and spontaneous abortions, mainly in the first trimester, have been reported following exposure to mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) in combination with other immunosuppressants during pregnancy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), and Use in Specific Populations (8.1), (8.3)]. Congenital malformations include:
Facial malformations: cleft lip, cleft palate, micrognathia, hypertelorism of the orbits
Abnormalities of the ear and eye: abnormally formed or absent external/middle ear, coloboma, microphthalmos
Malformations of the fingers: polydactyly, syndactyly, brachydactyly
Cardiac abnormalities: atrial and ventricular septal defects
Esophageal malformations: esophageal atresia
Nervous system malformations: such as spina bifida.
Cardiovascular: Venous thrombosis has been reported in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil administered intravenously.
Digestive: Colitis, pancreatitis
Hematologic and Lymphatic: Bone marrow failure, cases of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) and hypogammaglobulinemia have been reported in patients treated with Mycophenolate mofetil in combination with other immunosuppressive agents [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].
Immune: Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and angioedema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)], hypogammaglobinemia.
Infections: Meningitis, infectious endocarditis, tuberculosis, atypical mycobacterial infection, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, BK virus infection, viral reactivation of hepatitis B and hepatitis C, protozoal infections [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].
Respiratory: Bronchiectasis, interstitial lung disease, fatal pulmonary fibrosis, have been reported rarely and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of pulmonary symptoms ranging from dyspnea to respiratory failure in post-transplant patients receiving Mycophenolate mofetil.
Vascular: Lymphocele

### Expert consensus on the management of systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease [^112EFpj6]. Respiratory Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a rare, complex, connective tissue disorder. Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is common in SSc, occurring in 35–52% of patients and accounting for 20–40% of mortality. Evolution of therapeutic options has resulted in a lack of consensus on how to manage this condition. This Delphi study was initiated to develop consensus recommendations based on expert physician insights regarding screening, progression, treatment criteria, monitoring of response, and the role of recent therapeutic advances with antifibrotics and immunosuppressants in patients with SSc-ILD.

Methods

A modified Delphi process was completed by pulmonologists (n = 13) and rheumatologists (n = 12) with expertise in the management of patients with SSc-ILD. Panelists rated their agreement with each statement on a Likert scale from-5 (complete disagreement) to+5 (complete agreement). Consensus was predefined as a mean Likert scale score of ≤ -2.5 or ≥ +2.5 with a standard deviation not crossing zero.

Results

Panelists recommended that all patients with SSc be screened for ILD by chest auscultation, spirometry with diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide, high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT), and/or autoantibody testing. Treatment decisions were influenced by baseline and changes in pulmonary function tests, extent of ILD on HRCT, duration and degree of dyspnea, presence of pulmonary hypertension, and potential contribution of reflux. Treatment success was defined as stabilization or improvement of signs or symptoms of ILD and functional status. Mycophenolate mofetil was identified as the initial treatment of choice. Experts considered nintedanib a therapeutic option in patients with progressive fibrotic ILD despite immunosuppressive therapy or patients contraindicated/unable to tolerate immunotherapy. Concomitant use of nintedanib with MMF/cyclophosphamide can be considered in patients with advanced disease at initial presentation, aggressive ILD, or significant disease progression. Although limited consensus was achieved on the use of tocilizumab, the experts considered it a therapeutic option for patients with early SSc and ILD with elevated acute-phase reactants.

Conclusions

This modified Delphi study generated consensus recommendations for management of patients with SSc-ILD in a real-world setting. Findings from this study provide a management algorithm that will be helpful for treating patients with SSc-ILD and addresses a significant unmet need.

MMF

MMF is a prodrug of MPA that inhibits a metabolic pathway essential for lymphocyte function (Fig. 1). Extensive prospective and retrospective studies in SSc-ILD suggest that MMF may be effective in improving or stabilizing ILD. In the recent SLS II study, 142 patients with SSc-ILD were randomized to oral MMF (titrated to a target dose of 1500 mg twice daily) for 24 months or oral CYC (titrated to a target dose of 2.0 mg/kg/day) for 12 months followed by placebo for 12 months (Table 1). The primary endpoint was the percentage predicted FVC at 24 months, and improvement was positive in both treatment arms (MMF 2.2%, CYC 2.9%). While the between-treatment difference was not statistically significant, the difference from baseline was statistically significant for both treatments. Leucopenia and thrombocytopenia were more frequent with CYC (41 and 6%, respectively) than MMF (6 and 0%) and fewer MMF-treated patients withdrew from treatment or met criteria for treatment failure. Time to stopping treatment due largely to AEs was significantly shorter with CYC (P = 0.019). Of course, these data do not allow us to draw comparisons between MMF and the short courses of i.v. CYC that have previously been tested in this setting. In a large retrospective analysis in the UK, 109 MMF-treated patients with dcSSc (61 with lung involvement) were compared with 63 patients (40 with lung involvement) receiving other immunosuppressive agents. In the 5 years after starting treatment there was a significantly lower frequency of clinically significant pulmonary fibrosis in the MMF arm (P = 0.037) and significantly better 5-year survival from disease onset (P = 0.027) and start of treatment (P = 0.012). There were no significant differences in modified Rodnan skin score (mRSS) and FVC change.

While generally well tolerated, MMF is associated with gastrointestinal disturbances, myelosuppression and increased risk of infection. An enteric formulation, mycophenolate sodium, has been developed to reduce the incidence of gastrointestinal side effects.

MMF is often the initial treatment of choice for patients with SSc-ILD. It is not, however, included in the 2013 EULAR guidelines, which were developed before SLS II was published.

Methods

Search strategy

The prespecified protocol was submitted to PROSPERO on 3 May 2023 and registered on 16 May 2023 (CRD42023423223). The search strategy was last performed on 9 May 2023.

The population was defined as people with ILD (Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), chronic hypersensitivity pneumonia and all CTD-ILD, including systemic scleroderma) the intervention was MMF or AZA; the comparator was placebo or standard of care; the primary outcomes were per cent predicted FVC (%FVC) and DL CO (%DL CO). Adverse events, respiratory symptoms, quality of life and mortality were investigated as secondary outcomes. Relevant studies were searched in Medline and Embase using comprehensive search terms (online supplemental documents 1 and 2). Relevant ongoing trials were searched on(online supplemental document 3).

Inclusion criteria

Eligible studies included interventional randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and observational prospective studies of adults (> 18 years old) diagnosed with any ILD, where at least one arm was treated with MMF or AZA. Low doses of steroids concomitant with or prior to MMF or AZA treatment were allowed, while we excluded studies with concomitant high-dose therapies (≥ 20 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent). Finally, we excluded studies that did not report %FVC or %DL CO. No language restrictions were applied.

Study selection and data extraction

Two authors (FL and LF) independently assessed the titles and abstracts of the identified studies according to the eligibility criteria. Subsequently, two authors (FL and LF) evaluated the full text of the selected articles to determine their inclusion. Any disagreements were resolved through discussion and consensus with a third author (IS) resolving any remaining disagreements.

Data were independently extracted using a proforma and confirmed by two authors (FL and LF). Extracted data included study design, authors, year of publication; patient data namely age, reported sex or gender, duration of disease at the time of evaluation, aetiology of the disease and intervention characteristics, including MMF or AZA treatment, dose and duration of treatments. Primary outcomes of interest, %FVC and %DL CO, were extracted, along with any secondary outcomes reported, at baseline and follow-up time point closest to 12 months.

Continuous primary outcomes were collected as mean and SD at baseline and follow-up time points. When studies reported other summary values, these were converted to mean and SD. Secondary outcomes reported as dichotomous and categorical variables were extracted as ratio and/or per cent.

### Mycophenolate mofetil is safe, well tolerated, and preserves lung function in patients with connective tissue disease-related interstitial lung disease [^112Y2bab]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Interstitial lung disease (ILD) frequently complicates connective tissue diseases (CTDs). Glucocorticoids and immunomodulatory agents are regarded as mainstays of therapy for CTD-related ILD; however, apart from those studies that have evaluated certain medications for patients with scleroderma, few studies have been performed. In this study, our objectives were to examine the safety and tolerability of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and to determine its impact on lung function in patients with CTD-ILD.

Methods

In this retrospective observational study, we analyzed patients at our center who ever received MMF for CTD-ILD. We examined the frequency and severity of side effects associated with MMF and used longitudinal data analytic methods to determine the ability of MMF to maintain lung function over time.

Results

Twenty-eight patients were treated with MMF over 35.9 patient-years. The most common underlying CTD diagnosis was scleroderma (n = 9). The most common reason for initiating MMF was an adverse effect of a prior immunomodulatory agent. Six patients had clinically significant side effects related to MMF; all resolved with dose reduction. Compared to before MMF, the mean daily prednisone dose while patients were receiving MMF was lower (10 mg/d vs 15 mg/d, p = 0.09). In addition, since starting MMF, the average percentage of predicted forced vital capacity (FVC), average percentage of predicted total lung capacity, and average percentage of predicted diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide for the cohort increased by 2.3%, 4.0%, and 2.6%, respectively.

Conclusion

MMF appears to be safe and well tolerated in patients with CTD-ILD. Larger-scale studies are needed to further evaluate the efficacy of MMF in this patient population.

Qualitative synthesis of adverse events

All the studies reported adverse events. The most frequent adverse events in the treated arms were diarrhoea and pneumonia, followed by lympho/leucopenia, anaemia and skin infection (online supplemental table 3).

Four studies reported on respiratory symptoms. In the study by Mankikian et al, no significant difference was observed in the change from baseline in dyspnoea and cough between the treated patients and the placebo group. Naidu et al reported an improvement in respiratory symptoms in both arms of the study, with no significant difference between the treatment and control groups. Liossis et al reported an improvement in respiratory symptoms compared with baseline after administration of MMF. Vaiarello et al evaluated symptoms during a cardiopulmonary exercise test before and after MMF treatment, observing no significant difference in dyspnoea measured by the Borg scale.

Two studies reported change in quality of life. Mankikian et al and Naidu et al evaluated the change of quality of life between the interventional and the control arm using respectively the SF-36 V.1.3 questionnaire and the Medical Outcome Survey SF-36 V.2. Both these studies reported no difference in the QoL in MMF arm compared with control. None of the included studies reported on mortality.

### Mycophenolate mofetil (Myhibbin) [^117PFPZo]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

6.2 Postmarketing Experience

The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of mycophenolate mofetil. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure:

Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Congenital malformations and spontaneous abortions, mainly in the first trimester, have been reported following exposure to mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) in combination with other immunosuppressants during pregnancy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), and Use in Specific Populations (8.1), (8.3)]. Congenital malformations include:

- **Facial malformations**: cleft lip, cleft palate, micrognathia, hypertelorism of the orbits

- **Abnormalities of the ear and eye**: abnormally formed or absent external/middle ear, coloboma, microphthalmos

- **Malformations of the fingers**: polydactyly, syndactyly, brachydactyly

- **Cardiac abnormalities**: atrial and ventricular septal defects

- **Esophageal malformations**: esophageal atresia

- **Nervous system malformations**: such as spina bifida.

Digestive: Colitis, pancreatitis
Hematologic and Lymphatic: Bone marrow failure, cases of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) and hypogammaglobulinemia have been reported in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil in combination with other immunosuppressive agents [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].
Immune: Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and angioedema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)], hypogammaglobinemia.
Infections: Meningitis, infectious endocarditis, tuberculosis, atypical mycobacterial infection, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, BK virus infection, viral reactivation of hepatitis B and hepatitis C, protozoal infections [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].
Respiratory: Bronchiectasis, interstitial lung disease, fatal pulmonary fibrosis, have been reported rarely and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of pulmonary symptoms ranging from dyspnea to respiratory failure in post-transplant patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil.
Vascular: Lymphocele

### Use of mycophenolate mofetil or azathioprine for the management of chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis [^114Gtg7b]. Chest (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The treatment of chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis (cHP) often includes systemic oral corticosteroids, but the optimal pharmacologic management remains unclear. The morbidity associated with prednisone has motivated the search for alternative therapies. We aimed to determine the effect of treatment with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) or azathioprine (AZA) on lung function in patients with cHP.

Methods

Patients with cHP treated with either MMF or AZA were retrospectively identified from four interstitial lung disease centers. Change in lung function before and after treatment initiation was analyzed using linear mixed-effects modeling (LMM), adjusting for age, sex, smoking history, and prednisone use.

Results

Seventy patients were included: 51 were treated with MMF and 19 with AZA. Median follow-up after treatment initiation was 11 months. Prior to treatment initiation, FVC and diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (Dlco) % predicted were declining at a mean rate of 0.12% (P < .001) and 0.10% (P < .001) per month, respectively. Treatment with either MMF or AZA was not associated with improved FVC (0.5% at 1 year; p = 0.46) but was associated with a statistically significant improvement in Dlco of 4.2% (P < .001) after 1 year of treatment. Results were similar in the subgroup of patients treated with MMF for 1 year; the FVC increased nonsignificantly by 1.3% (P = 0.103) and Dlco increased by 3.9% (P < .001).

Conclusions

Treatment with MMF or AZA is associated with improvements in Dlco in patients with cHP. Prospective randomized trials are needed to validate their effectiveness for cHP.

### Mycophenolate mofetil versus oral cyclophosphamide in scleroderma-related interstitial lung disease (SLS II): a randomised controlled, double-blind, parallel group trial [^117D1gbe]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Progressive interstitial lung disease (ILD) is the leading cause of death attributed to systemic sclerosis (SSc), and treatment options are limited. In Scleroderma Lung Study (SLS) I, oral cyclophosphamide (CYC) for one year was associated with better pulmonary function, dyspnea, cutaneous sclerosis and health-related quality of life (HRQoL), as well as improved scores for lung fibrosis on high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT). However, when SLS I subjects were followed for an additional year off-treatment, the beneficial effects of CYC waned, and by 24 months, no significant differences from placebo were identified for most outcomes, including pulmonary function. Moreover, in SLS I, CYC was associated with acute toxicity, and its long-term administration is limited by the risk for developing treatment-related malignancies.

Because of its immunosuppressive properties and favorable safety profile, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is used post-solid organ transplantationand in the treatment of many autoimmune conditions. Moreover, uncontrolled studies suggest that MMF may be an effective immunosuppressive agent for treating SSc-ILD. – SLS II was designed to compare the efficacy and safety of MMF (administered for 2 years) and oral CYC (given for 1 year followed by placebo for another year) in symptomatic SSc-ILD.

### Updated systematic literature review and meta-analysis to inform the Italian Society of Rheumatology recommendations on the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis-associated interstitial lung disease [^117NNsh8]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

rheumatoid arthritis-associated interstitial lung disease (RA-ILD) is a severe extra-articular manifestation of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Despite recent guideline initiatives, no treatment recommendations specifically tailored to RA-ILD have been developed in Italy. This systematic literature review (SLR) and meta-analysis was conducted to inform the Italian Society of Rheumatology (SIR) national recommendations for the management of RA-ILD.

Methods

we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies evaluating pharmacological interventions for RA-ILD from inception up to October 2023, followed by an update up to April 2025, with a pre-defined protocol. Eligible studies included randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, and case series reporting pulmonary function outcomes, radiological progression, adverse events, and mortality. Meta-analyses were performed, and heterogeneity and publication bias were thoroughly assessed.

Results

sixty-nine studies encompassing 7879 RA-ILD patients were included. Treatments with conventional synthetic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (csDMARDs), rituximab (RTX), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), abatacept (ABA), and Janus kinase inhibitors (JAKi) were associated with stabilization or improvement of forced vital capacity (FVC). Methotrexate (MTX) was associated with reduced risk of ILD progression and mortality. Antifibrotics, particularly nintedanib, demonstrated variable efficacy, while pirfenidone showed limited benefit. Safety profiles favored antifibrotics over csDMARDs/immunosuppressants regarding serious adverse events.

Conclusions

this SLR provides an updated synthesis of evidence on RA-ILD treatments, supporting the forthcoming SIR recommendations. Despite inherent limitations of observational studies and heterogeneity, the data highlight the safety of MTX and particularly support ABA, RTX, and nintedanib as promising options, while underscoring the need for further high-quality trials specifically in RA-ILD.

Management of SSc-ILD

While there are no approved drugs for SSc-ILD, current approaches to treatment include routine follow-up alone (watchful waiting), or routine follow-up with active immunosuppression in patients with progressive ILD. The latest treatment guidelines for SSc, issued in 2016, reiterated the recommendation given in the 2009 guidelines that tailored treatment with CYC should be considered, particularly in patients with progressive disease. They also included a new recommendation for consideration of autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in selected patients with rapidly progressive SSc at risk of organ failure. Given the potential for serious adverse outcomes (including death) with HSCT, this approach requires careful evaluation of individualized risks and benefits. Importantly, the latest treatment guideline was completed prior to publication of the results of the Scleroderma Lung Study II (SLS II), which showed that treatment with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) for 2 years had comparable efficacy with oral CYC for 1 year followed by placebo for the second year.

Based on the available data, treatment decisions need to be made on a case by case basis. Not all patients will need therapy; however, active treatment should be considered when there is clinically significant disease at presentation or evidence of disease progression, as measured by a decline in lung function, progression of fibrosis on HRCT, or worsening respiratory symptoms due to ILD, and it is the patient's preference. While treatment may not be needed initially, as disease progression may occur at any time, routine monitoring is essential.

Regarding medical management for connective tissue disease-associated interstitial lung disease, more specifically with respect to management of progressive disease, antifibrotic agents, BSR 2024 guidelines recommend to initiate nintedanib in patients with systemic sclerosis-related pulmonary fibrosis progressing despite immunosuppressant treatment, depending on tolerability. Consider initiating nintedanib in combination with mycophenolate mofetil as first-line therapy in patients with extensive fibrosis.

American Thoracic Society guideline — The recommendation for use of the following agent for the treatment of SSc-ILD is strong: mycophenolate. The recommendation for the use of the following agents for the treatment of SSc-ILD is conditional: cyclophosphamide, rituximab, tocilizumab, nintedanib, and nintedanib plus mycophenolate. The recommendation for further research because of insufficient evidence was made for pirfenidone and pirfenidone plus mycophenolate and is strong. Six individual therapies and two combination therapies were assessed in this guideline.
