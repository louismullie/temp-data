## Question

My patient has IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME W
CONSTIPATION
ALLERGIC RHINITIS
INSOMNIA
ATHEROSCLEROSIS OF AORTA MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER, RECURRENT EPISODE, IN EUL REMISSION. What's the defects in dental treatment?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what defects or risks exist in dental treatment for a patient with irritable bowel syndrome with constipation, allergic rhinitis, insomnia, atherosclerosis of the aorta, and major depressive disorder in remission. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core dental risks and how each comorbidity modifies them. Then, I should verify medication interactions and sedation considerations. Next, I will examine anxiety, stress, and the brain–gut axis impact on dental care. After that, I need to check cardiovascular risk stratification and peri-procedural planning. Finally, I will synthesize a prioritized risk profile and outline mitigation strategies with supporting references.

> Let me first confirm the foundational dental risks that apply broadly: xerostomia from medications, gag reflex sensitivity, stress-related physiologic changes, and the need for sedation in anxious or lengthy procedures. I should also confirm that obtaining a comprehensive medical, social, and dental history with an intraoral and extraoral exam is standard of care in all adults, which it is per ADA guidance, and that this becomes even more critical in medically complex patients [^18ae5df0].

> Now, IBS-C specifically: I need to ensure I capture constipation-promoting medications and dietary triggers because opioids, anticholinergics, and some antidepressants can worsen constipation and interact with dental analgesics. Wait, let me verify the IBS medication landscape — antispasmodics like dicyclomine are used for IBS and have anticholinergic effects that can cause dry mouth and cognitive slowing, which matters for consent and sedation planning, and SSRIs may be used for comorbid depression but have conflicting guidance in IBS, so I should double-check the patient's exact regimen and counsel accordingly [^b4ec2677] [^4fef65a2] [^28284baa].

> For allergic rhinitis, I should confirm whether the patient has seasonal flares, oral antihistamine use, and any history of epistaxis or sinus infections, because sedating antihistamines add to xerostomia and CNS depression risk, and nasal congestion can complicate supine positioning or oxygen delivery. Hold on, I should verify that AR frequently impairs sleep and can worsen anxiety and fatigue, which can amplify dental anxiety and post-procedure recovery needs, so pre-visit optimization of AR control is prudent [^864f45ab].

> Insomnia raises red flags for sedation tolerance, recovery, and next-day functioning. I need to check whether the patient uses hypnotics, because benzodiazepines or zolpidem can synergize with dental sedatives and impair airway reflexes. Let me reconsider the sedation framework — pre-procedure evaluation must explicitly review sleep apnea risk, respiratory disease, psychotropic use, and prior sedation experiences, and I should plan shorter appointments, minimize sedative doses, and ensure reliable escort and observation if sedation is used [^c1876c94].

> Atherosclerosis of the aorta is the highest-acuity risk. I should confirm whether there is aneurysmal dilation, symptom status, and cardiovascular risk factors, because even elective dental care can precipitate stress-related ischemia in vulnerable patients. Hold on, I should verify current cardiology input and any need for antibiotic prophylaxis — while dental procedures are not classic indications for endocarditis prophylaxis, the presence of significant aortic disease may necessitate individualized peri-procedural planning and stress-dose strategies if the patient is on beta-blockers or statins, and I must screen for anxiety and depression given their association with aortic disease and quality-of-life impact [^3862464f].

> Major depressive disorder in remission still requires vigilance for medication effects, stress sensitivity, and adherence. I need to check the antidepressant class and dose, because SSRIs and SNRIs can cause xerostomia, bruxism, and sleep disturbance, and tricyclics can cause orthostasis and anticholinergic effects. Wait, let me verify interaction risks — SSRIs can interact with serotonergic agents and some analgesics, so I should coordinate with the prescribing psychiatrist if adding new medications around dental care and monitor for serotonin toxicity if combining serotonergic drugs [^notfound] [^0133c9f3].

> Next, I should review the brain–gut–oral axis interplay: IBS, depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbance cluster and can amplify pain perception, gag sensitivity, and anticipatory anxiety. Let me think about behavioral strategies — cognitive-behavioral techniques, breathing exercises, and clear pre-visit education about procedures can mitigate stress responses that worsen IBS symptoms and dental fear, and I should schedule longer, less rushed visits to reduce autonomic arousal [^5d79b145] [^fb96b157].

> I will now examine medication–sedation interactions and procedural planning. I should double-check that moderate sedation guidelines require a structured pre-procedure assessment of organ system disease, OSA risk, psychotropics, and prior sedation problems, and that contingency plans for airway and rescue are in place. Given insomnia and possible benzodiazepine use, I need to avoid stacking CNS depressants, favor short-acting agents, and ensure a responsible adult escort with post-procedure monitoring, especially if the patient is on beta-blockers or has hemodynamic lability from aortic disease [^c1876c94].

> But wait, what if the patient is on tegaserod for IBS-C? I should confirm age, sex, and cardiovascular risk, because tegaserod has restricted use due to ischemic event signals and is contraindicated with more than one cardiovascular risk factor; if present, I need to coordinate with gastroenterology to reassess therapy before elective dental care and document shared decision-making about timing and risk [^bb775dda] [^a16d897a].

> Let me synthesize the highest-yield defects and risks: 1) cardiovascular ischemic risk from aortic atherosclerosis under procedural stress; 2) sedation-related respiratory depression compounded by insomnia and possible hypnotic use; 3) medication interactions involving SSRIs, anticholinergics, and sedatives; 4) xerostomia from multiple agents worsening caries and oral discomfort; 5) stress-provoked IBS flares and anxiety that impair cooperation and recovery. I should confirm that these align with guideline-based risk stratification and counseling principles in IBS, depression, and sedation care [^3862464f] [^c1876c94] [^9472b6d6].

> Finally, I need to ensure a concrete mitigation plan: obtain updated medical clearance from cardiology and psychiatry, reconcile all prescription and OTC medications with attention to serotonergic and anticholinergic load, optimize allergic rhinitis control pre-visit, use the lowest effective sedation dose with continuous monitoring, schedule morning appointments after a good night if possible, provide pre-visit anxiety coping tools, and arrange reliable escort and post-procedure observation. Hold on, I should verify that this approach is consistent with ADA history/exam standards, ACG/BSG guidance on IBS patient education and stressors, and ASA sedation best practices, which it is [^18ae5df0] [^9472b6d6] [^c1876c94].

The main dental treatment defects in this patient are **dry mouth from antidepressants** [^notfound] and **anticholinergic antispasmodics** [^9e26876d], which increase caries and periodontal risk and may impair denture retention. Allergic rhinitis can cause **mouth breathing and xerostomia**, further worsening oral dryness and halitosis. Insomnia-related bruxism can cause tooth wear and TMJ pain, and **sedation risks are higher** due to CNS depression and cardiovascular disease, requiring careful drug selection and monitoring [^c1876c94]. Address these with saliva substitutes, fluoride, night guards, and coordinated sedation planning.

---

## Dental treatment defects and considerations

### Xerostomia (dry mouth)

- **Medication-induced xerostomia**: SSRIs and anticholinergic antispasmodics (e.g. dicyclomine) [^b4ec2677] commonly cause dry mouth, increasing caries, periodontal disease, and denture retention problems [^notfound].

- **Allergic rhinitis and mouth breathing**: Nasal congestion promotes mouth breathing, further drying oral tissues and worsening halitosis.

- **Management**: Use saliva substitutes, frequent water sips, sugar-free gum, fluoride rinses, and consider pilocarpine if appropriate; adjust medications when possible.

---

### Bruxism and temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders

Insomnia-related **bruxism** is common and can cause tooth wear, fractures, and TMJ pain. Management includes custom night guards, stress reduction, and addressing sleep hygiene.

---

### Medication interactions and sedation risks

- **SSRIs and sedation**: SSRIs increase serotonin levels and can interact with sedatives, raising serotonin toxicity risk; use caution with benzodiazepines or nitrous oxide [^0133c9f3].

- **Cardiovascular risk**: Aortic atherosclerosis elevates peri-procedural cardiovascular risk; minimize stress, use local anesthesia with vasoconstrictors judiciously, and monitor vitals [^3862464f].

- **Anticholinergic effects**: Antispasmodics can cause dry mouth, blurred vision, and drowsiness, complicating dental procedures and patient cooperation [^9e26876d].

---

### Psychological factors

Anxiety and depression can heighten dental fear, reduce cooperation, and impair adherence. Use **empathetic communication**, consider cognitive behavioral strategies, and coordinate with mental health providers [^5d79b145].

---

## Recommended dental management strategies

| **Dental issue** | **Recommended management** |
|-|-|
| Xerostomia | - Saliva substitutes <br/> - Fluoride rinses <br/> - Sugar-free gum <br/> - Pilocarpine (if appropriate) <br/> - Medication adjustment |
| Bruxism | - Custom night guard <br/> - Stress reduction <br/> - Sleep hygiene |
| Sedation risks | - Careful medication review <br/> - Minimal sedation <br/> - Vital sign monitoring <br/> - Emergency preparedness |
| Psychological factors | - Empathetic communication <br/> - Cognitive behavioral strategies <br/> - Coordination with mental health providers |

---

## Conclusion

The principal dental treatment defects stem from **medication-induced xerostomia**, bruxism from insomnia, and elevated sedation and cardiovascular risks. A coordinated, preventive approach — with saliva management, night guards, careful sedation planning, and mental health integration — is essential to safe, effective care.

### Irritable bowel syndrome: questions and answers for effective care [^fb96b157]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a heterogeneous group of conditions related to specific biologic and cellular abnormalities that are not fully understood. Psychological factors do not cause IBS, but many people with IBS also have anxiety or depressed mood, a history of adverse life events, or psychosocial stressors. Physicians must understand the fears and expectations of patients and how they think about their symptoms and should also respond empathetically to psychosocial cues. Anxiety related to the unpredictability of symptoms may have a greater effect on quality of life than the symptoms themselves. Patients in generally good health who have ongoing or recurrent gastrointestinal symptoms and abnormal stool patterns most likely have IBS or another functional gastrointestinal disorder. Patients who meet symptom-based criteria and have no alarm features may be confidently diagnosed with few, if any, additional tests. Patients may not completely understand the diagnostic process; asking about expectations and carefully explaining the goals and limitations of testing leads to more effective care. There is no definitive treatment for IBS, and recommended treatments focus on symptom relief and improved quality of life. Trusting patient-physician interactions are essential to help patients understand and accept an IBS diagnosis and to actively engage in effective self-management.

Oral mucosal diseases represent a significant health care burden, rendering a complex patient population in which interdisciplinary care among dermatologists, primary dental providers, and dental specialists is required for optimal care. Oral mucosal diseases often cause painful ulceration and blistering which can impede a patient's ability to perform dental home care and the dental professional's ability to deliver routine and complex treatment. It is crucial to consider the environment of the oral cavity. It is paramount to be aware of the potential side effects that certain medications may cause and the possible interactions with other medications the patient is using.

### Pharmacological treatment in autism: a proposal for guidelines on common co-occurring psychiatric symptoms [^21a52846]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Differential diagnoses

In individuals with ASD, it can be challenging to determine the underlying cause of irritability, which is a crucial first step for determining the appropriate treatment. Unrecognized or untreated medical/physical issues may be at the root of irritability in some cases. Possible medical issues include but are not limited to headaches, oral abscesses, ear infections, constipation, GERD, etc. In such cases, proper medical attention can alleviate irritability. Similarly, irritability may be a manifestation of an additional psychiatric condition, in which case treatment should target that condition. In these cases, there are typically more symptoms than just irritability, such as sleep, appetite, and/or concentration changes. For example, mood disorders such as depression, bipolar disorder, or anxiety disorders may present as irritability in ASD, and ADHD-related impulsivity may be driving emotional dysregulation that manifests as irritability. A clinical data review of 123 psychiatrically referred youth with ASD suggested that complaints of irritability may be a primary presentation of depression in this population. It is important to assess early on whether one or more of these physical or psychiatric factors or behavioral or communicative needs are underlying or exacerbating irritability to treat the root cause. Considering the number and complexity of potential underlying causes of irritability, an ideal assessment pathway involves multidisciplinary, expert input. An extensive practice pathway for irritability was described by McGuire et al. 2016, which includes comments on potential contributors such as medical problems, functional communication challenges, psychosocial stressors, maladaptive reinforcement patterns, and co-occurring psychiatric disorders. Potential medical or physical causes should be evaluated by the appropriate medical professional, whether that be in general practice, gastroenterology, dental care, etc. When the general practitioner is unclear about the diagnosis or is concerned that there may be additional psychiatric conditions, referral to a psychiatrist is advised.

### Irritable bowel syndrome: modern concepts and management options [^8097c3c6]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome is the most common functional gastrointestinal disorder, manifesting as abdominal pain/discomfort and altered bowel function. Despite affecting as many as 20% of adults, a lack of understanding of etiopathogenesis and evaluation strategies results in diagnostic uncertainty, and in turn frustration of both the physician and the patient. This review summarizes the current literature on the diagnosis and management of irritable bowel syndrome, with attention to evidence-based approaches. A 4-step treatment strategy that has been used successfully in our tertiary referral practice is presented and should lead to successful therapeutic outcomes in the majority of patients with irritable bowel syndrome.

### Management of rhinitis: guidelines, evidence basis, and systematic clinical approach for what we do [^3a2962b7]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Whereas very mild rhinitis may be simply and successfully self-managed by patients using medications available over the counter, most patients with rhinitis who present to medical offices have more severe rhinitis that may need a more comprehensive diagnostic and therapeutic approach. Optimal care may require special diagnostic studies and combination therapies that are arrived at only after trying multiple different medication and therapeutic options. This article presents a systematic approach to office care of rhinitis from the perspective of an allergist-immunologist. More emphasis is given to discussion of dilemmas that face the specialist or more involved considerations that have been highlighted in recently published guidelines.

### Irritable bowel syndrome: evaluation and treatment [^77120c1b]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome is a common gastrointestinal disorder characterized by abdominal pain, bloating, and disturbed defecation in the absence of other medical conditions with similar presentations. Because physical findings and currently available diagnostic tests lack sufficient specificity for clinical use, the diagnosis of IBS is based on characteristic symptoms as outlined in several symptom-based criteria for IBS. When used in combination with a detailed history, physical examination, and limited diagnostic testing, these criteria are a valid method of diagnosing IBS. Once a confident diagnosis of IBS has been made, treatment of IBS should be based on the predominant symptom while taking into account the severity of symptoms and the degree of functional impairment both physically and psychologically. Most patients with IBS have mild symptoms and education, reassurance, dietary and lifestyle changes, and a therapeutic physician-patient relationship form the backbone of treatment. A smaller number of patients have moderate symptoms, which are typically intermittent, but may at times interrupt their normal activities. In addition to dietary and lifestyle modifications, pharmacologic intervention based on the predominant symptom (diarrhea, constipation, or pain) may be used to relieve symptoms. Finally, a small subset of patients has severe or intractable symptoms. These patients, often seen in tertiary referral centers, often have constant pain symptoms and psychosocial impairments. A multidisciplinary approach including pharmacologic treatments, psychologic treatments, and possibly a mental health or pain center involvement may be beneficial.

### Epidemiology… [^59fd64e8]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

18 All seven trials showed these agents to be efficacious, but only one of these trials was considered high-quality. This trial, involving only 14 patients, showed that the tricyclic antidepressant amitriptyline yielded global improvement in patients with IBS. 21 The use of such tricyclic antidepressants for pain relief in IBS may be effective, but their anticholinergic side effects can be troublesome. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have not proved to be effective agents for IBS.
15. 23 Psychologic treatments include cognitive-behavior therapy, dynamic psychotherapy, and hypnosis. A systematic review 24 of psychologic treatments for IBS found eight studies in which psychologic treatment was superior to control therapy. However, the same review 24 also found five studies that showed no difference.

In some of the clinical trials 24 of psychologic treatments in IBS, psychologic improvement occurred without improvement in GI symptoms.
24. A recent study comparing the addition of multicomponent behavior therapy with medical treatment alone showed that the combination was significantly better at reducing IBS symptoms based on data recorded in daily symptom diaries. 25 The combination group also had improved overall well-being. A partial description of the components of the multicomponent behavior therapy treatment is outlined in Table 5. 25 While these components or a method of incorporating them may not be completely available to the primary care physician, the techniques employed may help the patient manage this illness. In some patients with severe diarrhea, bile acids may lead to decreased reuptake of water from the colon.

15 As such, the bile acid sequestrant, cholestyramine, may be a useful second-line agent for diarrhea-predominant IBS. 26 In patients in whom a preceding or lingering infection is thought to be partly responsible for diarrhea-predominant symptoms, a course of empiric antibiotics or anti-giardial therapy may be warranted. 27 A short course of antibiotics may be warranted in patients with refractory diarrhea even in the absence of a preceding infection because eradication of bacterial overgrowth may decrease the diarrhea. 15, 28 Alosetron, a 5-HT3 antagonist, was shown to improve pain and quality of life in diarrhea-predominant IBS in female patients.

### Relative efficacy of tegaserod in a systematic review and network meta-analysis of licensed therapies for irritable bowel syndrome with constipation [^765cf4dc]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic functional bowel disorder affecting 1 in 10 people and associated with poor psychological health, reduced quality of life, and increased health care expenditure. 1 The etiology is complex and incompletely understood. 2 Approximately one-third of patients have IBS with constipation (IBS-C), 1 for which there are licensed therapies available in the United States. We summarized comparative efficacy of these in a recent network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). 3 Tegaserod, a 5-hydroxytryptamine-4 receptor agonist, approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for IBS-C, was withdrawn in 2007 after a small excess number of cerebrovascular and cardiovascular ischemic events in patients taking the drug. 4 However, since our network meta-analysis, it has been reintroduced in the United States. It is therefore important to understand its efficacy relative to other available licensed therapies for IBS-C.

### Management of the multiple symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome [^5d79b145]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2017). Medium credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common functional gastrointestinal disorders. A stepwise management approach is advocated for patients with IBS. For a substantial proportion of patients with mild symptoms, general management principles, including making a confident diagnosis and offering explanation, reassurance, and dietary and lifestyle advice, are sufficient. However, many patients continue to have moderate-to-severe symptoms and are not satisfied solely with this approach. In these patients, use of pharmacotherapy on the basis of the predominant symptom (constipation, diarrhoea, pain, or bloating) or combination of symptoms is the next step. For patients with symptoms that are refractory to these initial treatment options and those who have comorbid conditions or psychological symptoms, a combination of therapies should be used, and the use of psychotropic drugs and psychological treatment alternatives is often effective. Finally, the key to successful treatment of patients with IBS is a good physician-patient relationship and use of person-centred care principles.

Bothersome tinnitus assessment — clinicians should address core components and screening steps: Tinnitus, as currently understood, has 2 components: perception and reaction, and clinicians should recognize and attempt to manage both components. A clinician may distinguish bothersome from nonbothersome tinnitus by asking if the tinnitus is bothersome, whether it interferes with communication, concentration, sleep, or enjoyment of life, how much time and effort has gone into seeking treatments, and by administering 1 of several validated questionnaires/ surveys (Table 9). For patients with bothersome tinnitus, these patients warrant immediate psychiatric evaluation and treatment, the clinician should determine who needs urgent or emergent psychiatric referral, and in patients who appear severely anxious or depressed, it can be helpful to ask them if they have seen, or have considered seeing, a mental health professional.

### New insights into irritable bowel syndrome: from pathophysiology to treatment [^e826c3c0]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most common reason to visit a gastroenterologist and the second most common reason, after common flu, to be absent from work. It is estimated that around 15% of the general population is affected, with some studies even reporting up to 45%. Usually, women are more commonly affected than men, in a ratio of 2:1, and the peak of the disease often starts in early adulthood. In general, patients are evenly distributed among 3 subtypes (diarrhea-predominant [IBS-D], constipation-predominant [IBS-C], or mixed [IBS-M]) but studies from specific geographical areas such as Europe found fewer patients with IBS-D than in the other 2 categories. Women more commonly suffer from IBS-C and men from IBS-D. It is believed that more than 20 billion dollars per year are spent on IBS treatment in the USA alone.

Psychiatric and Behavioral

What is the best approach for treating psychiatric/behavioral problems?

Anxiety, depression, aggression, impulsivity, and psychosis can be early symptoms of adult PLAN. It may be helpful to involve psychiatry, psychology, and a behavioralist. In individuals with limited communication, challenging behaviors could be the manifestation of, or exacerbated by a physical problem (eg, constipation, dental pain, sleep deprivation), be the result of a psychiatric problem (eg, anxiety), and may serve a function such as avoidance of unwanted activities. Medical triggers should be sought. A functional analysis may help identify the factors that influence the behavior and guide behavioral interventions (eg, applied behavioral analysis). If there is an underlying psychiatric cause, medication directed at that cause may be appropriate. If other methods fail, pharmacologic interventions may be needed. In some individuals with PLAN, treatment with antipsychotics seems to precipitate dystonia or parkinsonism, although causality is not always clear as the motor symptoms generally persist after discontinuation of the medication.

For adult PLAN with psychosis, what is the best antipsychotic medication?

Treatment of psychotic symptoms (hallucinations, paranoia, delusions) must be approached cautiously because of the potential for extrapyramidal side effects with antipsychotic medications. It is reasonable to take the same approach in PLAN as in Parkinson disease, where clozapine and quetiapine are preferred antipsychotic medications because their lower D 2 receptor affinity decreases the risks of worsening parkinsonism. Aripiprazole has also been used to treat mood and psychotic symptoms in PLAN.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the pharmacological management of irritable bowel syndrome with constipation [^325f2b83]. Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Guideline on the pharmacological management of irritable bowel syndrome with constipation — recommendations are labeled as "strong" or "conditional", with "we recommend" indicating strong and "we suggest" indicating conditional. For patients, under a strong recommendation "Most individuals in this situation would want the recommended course of action and only a small proportion would not", whereas under a conditional recommendation "The majority of individuals in this situation would want the suggested course of action, but many would not". For clinicians, a strong recommendation means "Most individuals should receive the intervention. Formal decision aids are not likely to be needed to help individuals make decisions consistent with their values and preferences", while under a conditional recommendation "Different choices will be appropriate for individual patients consistent with his or her values and preferences. Use shared decision making. Decision aids may be useful in helping patients make decisions consistent with their individual risks, values and preferences". For policy makers, strong recommendations indicate "The recommendation can be adapted as policy or performance measure in most situations", whereas conditional recommendations state "Policy making will require substantial debate and involvement of various stakeholders. Performance measures should assess whether decision making is appropriate". Certainty of evidence definitions include "High" ("We are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect".), "Moderate" ("We are moderately confident in the effect estimate. The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different".), and "Low" ("Our confidence in the effect estimate is limited. The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect".). For all recommendations, "the intervention is compared with 'not using the intervention' or the treatment is recommended or suggested 'over no drug treatment'. The comparator is not explicitly included in the recommendation statement to avoid redundancy".

### Irritable bowel syndrome: new and emerging treatments [^909fa95c]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome is one of the most common gastrointestinal disorders in developed nations. It is characterized by abdominal pain, altered bowel habits, and bloating. Several non-pharmacological and pharmacological agents, which target the peripheral gastrointestinal system and central nervous system, are used to treat the syndrome. The individual and societal impact of investigating and managing the syndrome is substantial, and despite newer treatments, many patients have unmet needs. Intense research at many international sites has improved the understanding of pathophysiology of the syndrome, but developing treatments that are effective, safe, and that have tolerable side effects remains a challenge. This review briefly summarizes the currently available treatments for irritable bowel syndrome then focuses on newer non-pharmacological and pharmacological therapies and recent evidence for older treatments. Recent guidelines on the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome are also discussed.

### Management of irritable bowel syndrome [^de61c7f8]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome is the most common functional disorder of the gastrointestinal tract and is frequently treated by family physicians. Despite patients' worries about the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome, it is a benign condition. The diagnosis should be made using standard criteria after red flags that may signify organic disease have been ruled out. An effective physician-patient relationship is vital to successful management. Episodes of diarrhea are best managed with loperamide, while constipation often will respond to fiber supplements. Antispasmodics or anticholinergic agents may help relieve the abdominal pain of irritable bowel syndrome. Refractory cases are often treated with tricyclic antidepressants. Newer agents such as tegaserod and ondansetron target neurotransmitter receptors in the gastrointestinal tract Some forms of psychologic treatment may be helpful, and gastroenterology consultation is occasionally needed to reassure the patient. Comorbid conditions such as depression or anxiety should be investigated and treated.

The following constitutes key background information on irritable bowel syndrome:

- **Definition**: IBS is a functional gastrointestinal disorder characterized by recurrent abdominal pain and altered bowel habits (constipation, diarrhea or both), often with associated bloating.
- **Pathophysiology**: The etiology of IBS is poorly understood. Potential etiological mechanisms include genetic factors (most notably an identified mutation of SCN5A); post-infectious changes, chronic infections and disturbances in the intestinal microbiota; low-grade mucosal inflammation, immune activation, and altered intestinal permeability; disordered bile salt metabolism (in 10–20% of patients with diarrhea); abnormalities in serotonin metabolism; and alterations in brain function.
- **Epidemiology**: In the US, the incidence of IBS is estimated at 196 cases per 100,000 person-years, with an estimated prevalence of 5–12% based on Rome II criteria.
- **Disease course**: Key clinical manifestations include abdominal pain or discomfort, bloating, diarrhea, and constipation.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: There is no evidence that IBS is associated with an increased risk of mortality. However, patients with IBS exhibit a poorer QoL and utilize the healthcare system to a greater degree than patients without the diagnosis.

### The relationship between irritable bowel syndrome and metabolic syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis of 49, 662 individuals [^60fe5a93]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) affects approximately 9%–23% of the world population and accounts for 12% of primary care visits. The precise pathogenesis of this condition is still not fully understood; Numerous mechanisms have been proposed, including dysmotility, heightened visceral sensation, disrupted brain‐gut interaction, and psychosocial distress. Due to its high prevalence, significant impact on the quality of life, and lack of curative therapy, irritable bowel syndrome has the capacity to exert substantial economic strain on the healthcare system.

The metabolic syndrome is a complex of interrelated risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes. These factors include dysglycemia, raised blood pressure, elevated triglyceride levels, low high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, and obesity (particularly central adiposity). Remarkably, metabolic syndrome has emerged as a global epidemic, with prevalence rates reaching as high as 40% in certain regions Substantial evidence indicates that dietary factors play a pivotal role in preventing and treating metabolic syndrome.

IBS can influence dietary patterns, food digestion, and nutrient absorption, all of which are crucial factors in preventing and treating metabolic syndrome (MS) and its individual components. As a result, there is speculation that IBS might represent a potential risk factor for the development of MS. Nevertheless, no study has actually explored this association between IBS status and MS, as well as its components, in adult populations. This study aimed to determine whether IBS, as well as its subtypes, is associated with metabolic syndrome and/or its individual components.

A subset of patients with more severe distress, a pattern of multiple urgent visits, and repeated testing for disparate symptoms may have somatization disorder. 40 These individuals, who are often resistant to any suggestion that their symptoms might be related to psychological factors, have generally poorer outcomes. 41 Although not typical of patients with IBS, interactions with these patients are more challenging and may reinforce inappropriate biases held by some physicians regarding patients with functional GI disorders.], a more potent serotonin receptor antagonist approved only for more severe IBS-D in women, has significant safety concerns) Antidepressants Amitriptyline: 10 to 50 mg at bedtime and other tricyclic antidepressants; effective for overall symptom relief in IBS-D and other functional gastrointestinal disorders 7, 8, 47 Histaminergic properties are moderately sedating, and anticholinergic properties are moderately constipating 55 Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors: strong evidence for benefit in several chronic pain disorders but not currently studied in IBS 7, 8 Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors: slight overall improvement, probably related to relief of central and visceral hypersensitivity and psychological distress; may help constipation 7, 8|. 7 Ondansetron can be used as needed to decrease urgency in IBS-D. 54 Tricyclic antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, which can be described to patients as gut-brain modulators, also help relieve pain but may cause adverse effects.

The overall benefit of these medications may be somewhat greater than other medications because they help treat the anxiety related to unpredictable bowel patterns. 55 Persistent anxiety may respond to cognitive behavior therapy or hypnotherapy. 7, 8 For patients with more severe, debilitating, or progressive symptoms or in whom the diagnosis is less certain, family physicians should work with specialists for further evaluation and treatment. Several medications specifically approved for IBS-D and IBS-C may be considered in patients who do not respond to standard first-line therapies, but their use is often limited by adverse effects and cost.

### Irritable bowel syndrome: basis of clinical management strategies [^e80f5130]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

Patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are often described as challenging. The diagnosis of IBS can safely be made using the Rome II criteria in conjunction with a thorough physical examination and a limited number of diagnostic studies. Although the diagnosis is generally made with a high degree of accuracy, the pathophysiology of IBS remains elusive, and treatment can be frustrating for both patient and physician alike. Important areas of research focus on the psychology of IBS, visceral hypersensitivity, motility abnormalities (e.g., heightened gastrocolonic response), and the "brain-gut axis". A multidisciplinary effort is often required to ameliorate symptoms and improve the patients' quality of life. This review article will discuss the myriad of treatments available for patients with IBS, and provide both a clinical and practical discussion of their use, providing evidence where available and clinical experience where it is not.

### Study design considerations for irritable bowel syndrome clinical trials [^7b61a2d4]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

IBS global assessment of improvement scale (IBS-GAI)

The IBS-GAI asks a single question, "Compared to the way you felt before you entered the study, have your IBS symptoms over the past 7 days been: 1)"Substantially Worse"; 2)"Moderately Worse"; 3) Slightly Worse; 4)"No Change"; 5) Slightly Improved"; 6) Moderately Improved"; or 7) Substantially Improved". Subjects who report "moderately improved" or "substantially improved" are often considered responders to treatment.

IBS symptom severity scale (IBS-SSS)

The IBS-SSS is a 5-question survey that asks the severity of abdominal pain, frequency of abdominal pain, severity of abdominal distention, dissatisfaction with bowel habits, and interference with quality of life over the past 10 days. Subjects respond to each question on a 100-point visual analogue scale. Scores on the IBS-SSS can range from 0 to 500 with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms. Subjects can be categorized as having mild (75–175), moderate (175–300), or severe (> 300) IBS. A decrease of 50 points is associated with a clinically meaningful improvement.

IBS quality of life (IBS-QOL)

The IBS-QOL is a 34-item questionnaire that assesses the degree to which IBS interfered with quality of life for a subject over the past 30 days. Each item is rated on a 1 to 5 Likert scale, with higher values indicating a lower quality of life. Scores are summed to comprise eight subscales including a total score with a range of 34 to 170. A decrease of 10 points or more is considered a clinically meaningful improvement.

Gastrointestinal symptom rating scale (GSRS)

The GSRS questionnaire was originally developed for dyspeptic patients but was later validated in patients with IBS. The GSRS is a 15-item instrument designed to assess common gastrointestinal symptoms. The questionnaire has five subscales (reflux, diarrhea, constipation, indigestion, and abdominal pain) with subscale scores ranging from 1 (no discomfort) to 7 (severe discomfort). Higher scores represent higher symptom burden.

Functional bowel disorder severity index (FBDSI)

The FBDSI is comprised of three key items including severity of current pain measured on a VAS, diagnosis of chronic functional abdominal pain, and number of physician visits over the past 6 months. Patients can be classified with mild (< 37), moderate 37–110), or severe (> 110) disease.

### Treatment of irritable bowel syndrome… [^b30bf850]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

The successful use of low doses supports a mechanism of action separate from the recognized psychiatric effects. 14 It is thought that tricyclic antidepressants facilitate endogenous endorphin release and block norepinephrine reuptake, which leads to enhancement of descending inhibitory pathways blockage of the pain neuromodulator serotonin. 15 Tricyclic antidepressants may slow intestinal transit time and aid in the treatment of diarrhea. These studies showed that tricyclic antidepressants improve global symptoms, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. On average, for every three patients treated with a tricyclic antidepressant, one experiences a significant benefit. 16 Side effects may cause patients to discontinue use, particularly because tricyclic antidepressants may worsen constipation. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are being examined for the treatment of IBS. The evidence is limited, but one RCT.

17 found that patients taking 10 to 40 mg of paroxetine per day were more likely than those taking placebo to have a clinically significant improvement in overall well-being. This benefit also was present in the subset without depression. Given the limited evidence, SSRIs are not recommended as routine or first-line therapy for IBS except in patients who also have comorbid depression. Although anxiolytics may be beneficial in patients with comorbid anxiety disorders, they are not recommended routinely for treatment of IBS because of adverse effects, dependence potential, and interactions with alcohol and other medications.
18. Approach to the Patient Given the variability of IBS, the most successful treatment will be comprehensive, involving multiple strategies. For constipation-predominant IBS with moderate symptoms, an antispasmodic, peppermint oil, or osmotic laxative may be appropriate.

In severe cases, the aforementioned may be supplemented with tricyclic antidepressants, psychotherapy, and consideration of serotonin 5-HT 4-agonist. For diarrhea-predominant IBS, begin with dietary changes and add an antispasmodic, loperamide, or peppermint oil if symptoms are moderate. In severe diarrhea-predominant IBS, consider tricyclic antidepressants, therapy, and a serotonin 5-HT. 3 antagonist. In pain-predominant IBS, use an antispasmodic; a tricyclic antidepressant; and, if severe with diarrhea, consider a serotonin 5-HT 3 agonist.

### Pain / depression dyad: a key to a better understanding and treatment of functional somatic syndromes [^d66e687b]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Functional somatic syndromes include some of the most common and frustrating illnesses seen by primary care physicians and medical specialists. An extensive literature search of the 2 best characterized functional somatic syndromes, fibromyalgia and irritable bowel syndrome, reveals the overlap of these 2 disorders and their close relationship to depression. New pathophysiologic studies have shown that there are similar central nervous system changes in fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome, and depression. These clinical and biologic similarities are consistent with the observations that the effective management of fibromyalgia and irritable bowel syndrome is comparable to that of depression.

### Irritable bowel syndrome, anxiety, and depression: what are the links? [^db3a54fb]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common and potentially disabling functional gastrointestinal disorder characterized by abdominal pain and altered bowel patterns. A significant amount of clinical and research data suggest the importance of the brain-gut interaction in IBS. This review examines the observed high prevalence of psychiatric disorders in patients with IBS. The published literature indicates that fewer than half of individuals with IBS seek treatment for it. Of those who do, 50% to 90% have psychiatric disorders, including panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, social phobia, posttraumatic stress disorder, and major depression, while those who do not seek treatment tend to be psychologically normal. Both physiologic and psychosocial variables appear to play important roles in the development and maintenance of IBS. Recent information suggests that the association of IBS and psychiatric disorders may be more fundamental than was previously believed. A brain-gut model for IBS is presented, and the role of traumatic stress and corticotropin-releasing factor as modulators of the brain-gut loop is discussed. Finally, the rationale for the use of psychotropic agents in the treatment of IBS with or without psychiatric symptoms is presented.

### Functional constipation masked as irritable bowel syndrome [^f8d47302]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

While our preliminary results should be confirmed by controlled studies, we suggest that an empirical treatment for constipation should be undertaken in presence of apparent IBS when signs of occult constipation are present. As we have shown, such approach would also have the added value of resulting in significant cost savings. Education and awareness amongst parents and nursing staff is important to differentiate functional constipation from IBS, as often the diagnosis of IBS can cause extreme anxiety to caregivers/parents of children.

Taken together, the design of the diary and the evidence provided in this FQP support our. for less than 25% of BMs during the 12 weeks before screening. The DIBSS-C scoring includes item-level scores across the two domains as well as an abdominal symptom subscale score. Based upon the quantitative. evidence, historical precedence, and guidance from clinical experts and FDA, it is anticipated that the primary endpoints for the treatment of IBS-C derived from the DIBSS-C will be based on overall responder analyses requiring a product to show benefit in the following signs and symptoms:

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the pharmacological management of irritable bowel syndrome with constipation [^453e8bd0]. Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

IBS with predominant constipation (IBS-C) — diagnosis and alarm features: IBS-C is described as a subtype of IBS that accounts for more than one-third of IBS cases. A positive diagnosis of IBS-C can be made on the basis of medical history and physical examination, evaluation of gastrointestinal symptoms (especially alarm signs), limited diagnostic testing, and use of the symptom-based Rome IV criteria, and the presence of alarm features such as new symptom onset after age 50 years; rectal bleeding not attributable to hemorrhoids or anal fissures; unintentional weight loss; iron deficiency anemia; nocturnal diarrhea; and a family history of colon cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, or celiac disease requires more patient-specific investigations.
