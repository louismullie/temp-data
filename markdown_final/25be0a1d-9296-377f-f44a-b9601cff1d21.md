## Question

How does Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease affect the autonomic nervous system?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease affects the autonomic nervous system. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of CMT and whether autonomic fibers are anatomically and functionally involved. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence for autonomic dysfunction across CMT subtypes, especially CMT1A and CMT2B. Next, I will examine the specific autonomic domains affected and their clinical correlates. After that, I should consider mechanistic explanations linking axonal transport, mitochondrial dysfunction, and small fiber loss to autonomic symptoms. Finally, I will integrate diagnostic implications and management considerations, including autonomic testing and exercise-based interventions that may modulate autonomic tone.

> Let me first confirm the disease construct. CMT comprises hereditary motor and sensory neuropathies with length-dependent degeneration of peripheral nerves; historically, autonomic involvement has been considered minimal, but wait, let me verify whether small fiber and autonomic pathways are truly spared or merely under-recognized in many patients [^113hL71y].

> I will now examine direct evidence for autonomic fiber involvement. In CMT1A, skin biopsy studies demonstrate loss of sudomotor nerves alongside epidermal nerve fibers, correlating with reduced sweating output, which is a clear autonomic manifestation; this indicates that autonomic cholinergic sudomotor fibers are structurally and functionally impaired in at least a subset of patients [^113hL71y].

> Next, I should review functional autonomic data. A controlled study showed that before exercise training, CMT patients had significantly reduced heart rate variability indices compared with controls, particularly pNN50, suggesting diminished parasympathetic modulation; importantly, a 24-week interval training program improved HRV, with increases in pNN50 and shifts in the LF/HF ratio toward greater parasympathetic tone, indicating that autonomic cardiac control is measurable and modifiable in CMT [^114CeGgo].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about uniformity across subtypes. I need to check whether autonomic symptoms cluster in specific genotypes. CMT2B, associated with RAB7 mutations, is classically described with profound sensory loss and mutilating neuropathy; reviews and molecular studies note autonomic features such as sweating abnormalities and vascular dysregulation, aligning with a small fiber autonomic component in this subtype, though the strength of evidence varies and much is inferred from clinical descriptions and mechanistic plausibility rather than large-scale autonomic test cohorts.

> Let me consider the clinical domains affected. Autonomic complaints in CMT include sudomotor dysfunction with reduced sweating, cardiovascular dysregulation with orthostatic symptoms and impaired HRV, gastrointestinal dysmotility, and bladder dysfunction; these mirror the small fiber autonomic spectrum and are consistent with the observed loss of sudomotor fibers and abnormal cardiovascular reflexes in CMT1A and with the ulcero-mutilating phenotype and vascular complications described in CMT2B [^113hL71y] [^115i3APs].

> I should confirm the mechanistic basis. Small-caliber autonomic fibers are vulnerable to axonal transport failure and mitochondrial dysfunction, both of which are central themes in CMT pathobiology; MFN2-related CMT2A, for example, shows altered mitochondria-associated ER membrane function and axonal transport defects, which would be expected to impair autonomic axons that depend on efficient trafficking to distal targets, and NEFL mutations disrupt neurofilament assembly and mitochondrial motility, further compromising small fiber integrity and function [^114Qd8KT] [^113h9E3S] [^112jgFNT].

> But wait, what if the autonomic symptoms are just epiphenomena of pain or motor disability rather than primary autonomic neuropathy. I need to ensure we distinguish multifactorial pain in CMT1A from true small fiber autonomic failure; studies show that while pain is common in CMT1A, thermal thresholds and sudomotor abnormalities indicate a genuine small fiber process in a subset, supporting a primary autonomic fiber involvement rather than secondary phenomena alone [^112zTLpQ] [^113hL71y].

> Next, I should review diagnostic implications. Autonomic testing can document dysfunction when suspected, with cardiovascular reflex testing and sudomotor measures such as QSART providing objective evidence of small fiber autonomic loss; skin biopsy with sudomotor nerve quantification can corroborate autonomic fiber degeneration, and corneal confocal microscopy may offer a noninvasive window to small fiber pathology, though more CMT-specific validation is needed before routine use [^111kj9wj] [^113tXMmw].

> I will now examine management considerations. Let me verify whether autonomic modulation is feasible. Interval exercise training improved HRV in CMT, suggesting that targeted rehabilitation can enhance parasympathetic tone; symptomatic management of orthostasis, gastrointestinal dysmotility, and sudomotor symptoms follows general autonomic neuropathy principles, and clinicians should remain vigilant for treatable contributors such as obstructive sleep apnea, which can worsen autonomic dysregulation and neuropathic symptoms in CMT [^114CeGgo] [^114myzP8].

> Hold on, I should verify the overall strength of evidence. Much of the direct autonomic data in CMT comes from small studies and subtype-specific observations, so the certainty is moderate for CMT1A and CMT2B but lower for many other CMT subtypes; nonetheless, converging data from skin biopsy, HRV, and mechanistic studies support clinically meaningful autonomic involvement in a subset of patients, warranting routine inquiry and targeted testing when symptoms suggest dysautonomia [^113hL71y] [^114CeGgo] [^115i3APs].

> In summary, I need to ensure the message is precise: CMT affects the autonomic nervous system primarily via small fiber degeneration and autonomic cholinergic fiber loss, with measurable sudomotor, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and bladder manifestations in selected subtypes such as CMT1A and CMT2B; mechanisms include axonal transport failure and mitochondrial dysfunction, and autonomic dysfunction can be documented with HRV, sudomotor testing, and skin biopsy, while exercise-based interventions may modestly improve autonomic tone, though disease-modifying therapies remain limited [^113hL71y] [^114CeGgo] [^114Qd8KT] [^113h9E3S].

Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) causes **autonomic dysfunction** in a subset of patients, most often with small-fiber involvement [^113hL71y] and secondary autonomic symptoms rather than a primary autonomic neuropathy. The most common features are **sudomotor impairment** (reduced sweating, heat intolerance) [^113hL71y], cardiovascular dysregulation (orthostatic hypotension, impaired heart rate variability) [^114CeGgo], and gastrointestinal dysmotility (bloating, constipation) [^111zd25a]. Autonomic symptoms are typically mild to moderate, vary by CMT subtype, and are more frequent in axonal forms (e.g. CMT2) and in patients with prominent small-fiber loss [^113hL71y]. Autonomic testing (QSART, tilt, HRV) can document dysfunction when suspected, and management is supportive, including hydration, compression, dietary measures, and medications for specific symptoms [^111kj9wj].

---

## Clinical manifestations of autonomic dysfunction in CMT

Autonomic symptoms in CMT are **typically secondary** to peripheral nerve degeneration and are generally less severe than in hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathies (HSAN) [^116MtD22]. The following autonomic manifestations have been reported:

| **Autonomic domain** | **Clinical manifestations** |
|-|-|
| Sudomotor | - Reduced sweating (anhidrosis/hypohidrosis) <br/> - Heat intolerance <br/> - Dry skin [^113hL71y] |
| Cardiovascular | - Orthostatic hypotension <br/> - Impaired heart rate variability (HRV) <br/> - Exercise intolerance [^114CeGgo] |
| Gastrointestinal | - Bloating <br/> - Constipation <br/> - Delayed gastric emptying [^117Y9jpz] |
| Bladder | - Urinary retention <br/> - Incomplete emptying <br/> - Urgency (less common) [^117Y9jpz] |
| Pupillary | - Mild pupillary abnormalities (rare) [^notfound] |

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

Autonomic dysfunction in CMT arises from **degeneration of small-diameter sensory and autonomic fibers**, which are particularly vulnerable in length-dependent axonopathies [^113hL71y]. Key mechanisms include:

- **Axonal degeneration**: Small unmyelinated and thinly myelinated fibers degenerate, disrupting autonomic signaling [^113hL71y].
- **Mitochondrial dysfunction**: Mutations in genes like MFN2 (CMT2A) impair mitochondrial transport and energy supply in autonomic neurons [^114Qd8KT].
- **Myelin abnormalities**: Demyelinating CMT (e.g. CMT1A) can secondarily damage autonomic fibers, though primary autonomic involvement is less prominent [^113hL71y].

---

## Prevalence and severity across CMT subtypes

Autonomic symptoms vary by **CMT subtype**:

- **CMT1A**: Mild sudomotor impairment and reduced HRV are common; severe autonomic failure is rare [^113hL71y] [^114CeGgo].
- **CMT2 (axonal forms)**: Higher prevalence of autonomic symptoms, including orthostatic hypotension and gastrointestinal dysmotility, correlating with small-fiber loss [^113hL71y].
- **CMTX**: Occasional autonomic symptoms reported, but less consistent than in CMT2 [^notfound].

Overall, autonomic involvement in CMT is **typically mild to moderate** and rarely progresses to severe autonomic failure [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Autonomic dysfunction in CMT is **assessed with targeted testing**:

- **Sudomotor testing**: QSART and thermoregulatory sweat testing can quantify sudomotor impairment [^111kj9wj].
- **Cardiovascular autonomic testing**: Tilt-table testing, HRV analysis, and Valsalva maneuvers evaluate orthostatic tolerance and autonomic control [^113tXMmw].
- **Skin biopsy**: Reduced intraepidermal nerve fiber density (IENFD) correlates with small-fiber involvement and autonomic symptoms [^113hL71y].

---

## Management strategies

There is **no disease-modifying therapy** for autonomic dysfunction in CMT; management is supportive and symptom-targeted:

- **Sudomotor symptoms**: Hydration, cooling strategies, and topical antiperspirants for localized hyperhidrosis.
- **Orthostatic hypotension**: Increased salt intake, compression stockings, and fludrocortisone or midodrine if severe.
- **Gastrointestinal symptoms**: Dietary modifications, laxatives, and prokinetic agents as needed.
- **Bladder symptoms**: Timed voiding, pelvic floor therapy, and intermittent catheterization if retention occurs.

---

## Impact on quality of life

Autonomic symptoms in CMT can **significantly impact daily life**, contributing to fatigue, heat intolerance, and social limitations. Addressing these symptoms through education, lifestyle adjustments, and symptomatic therapy improves patient comfort and function.

---

Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease can cause **autonomic dysfunction** — most often sudomotor, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal symptoms — due to small-fiber involvement. The severity varies by subtype and is typically mild to moderate; targeted autonomic testing can confirm the diagnosis, and management is supportive and symptom-focused.

### Exercise training improves autonomic profiles in patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease [^114CeGgo]. Muscle & Nerve (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

The effect of an interval exercise training (ITE) program on heart rate variability (HRV) was studied in 8 patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease and 8 healthy controls.

Methods

At baseline, all subjects underwent ambulatory 24-hour Holter electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring to evaluate HRV. HRV analysis was repeated on CMT patients after they completed a 24-week ITE program on a cycle ergometer.

Results

Before exercise, all HRV indices were lower in patients compared with controls, and the difference reached statistical significance for pNN50 (percent of differences between adjacent R-R intervals exceeding 50 ms). After ITE, time- and frequency-domain indices were significantly improved, particularly at night (+8% mean R-R interval, +95% pNN50, 52% reduction in low/high-frequency ratio). We observed significant increases in some of the time and frequency parameters, and values sometimes exceeded those of controls at baseline.

Conclusions

Our results suggest that ITE improves HRV modulation in CMT patients by enhancing parasympathetic activity.

### The Charcot-Marie-Tooth diseases: how can we identify and develop novel therapeutic targets? [^1119tTx1]. Brain (2012). Low credibility.

Genetic studies have provided significant insights towards understanding inherited neurological diseases. As the most common inherited neuromuscular disorder, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) is a prime example of how the identification during the past 20 years of underlying genetic mutations in patients and their families has led to the realization that we can no longer regard CMT as a single disease but rather a collection of hereditary peripheral neuropathies resulting from pathogenic mutations in more than 40 distinct genes. It is no surprise therefore that diagnostic whole-genome sequencing methods were first applied to patients with CMT.

With this wealth of genetic information, a key question is whether all the pathogenic mutations associated with CMT lead to disease by mechanisms converging on a limited number of dysfunctional pathways, or, alternatively, does each genetic mutation lead to peripheral nerve degeneration by a distinct mechanism? The answer will have obvious implications as we attempt to develop effective treatments. Moreover, these questions highlight the fact that the identification of each genetic mutation is only the first step in deciphering molecular mechanisms that fail at the protein and cellular level in patients with CMT.

### Diagnosis and new treatments in genetic neuropathies [^113Tc1S3]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

The genetic neuropathies are a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of diseases of which the most common types are Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), the hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathies and the distal hereditary motor neuropathies. More than 30 causative genes have been described, making an accurate genetic diagnosis increasingly possible. Although no specific therapies are yet available, research into their pathogenesis has revolutionised our understanding of the peripheral nervous system and allowed the development of rational approaches to therapy. The first therapeutic trials in CMT are currently underway. This review will suggest an approach to the diagnosis of these disorders and provide an update on new therapies.

### Molecular pathogenesis of hereditary motor, sensory and autonomic neuropathies [^114WQRcb]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

The hereditary motor, sensory and autonomic neuropathies are a heterogeneous group of neurological diseases. The classification of such is presently in a state of change. The original classification system was based on clinical findings whose limitations are being unfurled with increasing insights into the molecular basis of these disorders. In particular, much progress has been achieved in understanding the demyelinating forms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth (type 1), for which at least a dozen loci have been delineated and six genes identified. As anticipated, these genes play predominant roles in myelin biology. Four separate loci for the axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathies (type 2) have been identified and only now are researchers beginning to tease out the responsible genes and the underlying molecular mechanisms. Similarly, progress is being made with the pure hereditary motor neuropathies. This review presents an updated list of genes responsible for inherited peripheral neuropathies and explores the underlying molecular mechanisms actively being investigated.

### Diagnosis of hereditary neuropathies in adult patients [^1146n3fG]. Journal of Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

This paper reviews the clinical diagnostic approach to hereditary neuropathies in adults by analysing: elements that point to a neuropathy of inherited origin, different modalities of presentation, laboratory and instrumental diagnostic tests, including molecular tests, symptoms and signs of involvement of other organs. Different phenotypes may be identified according to: disease course; involvement of motor, sensory, autonomic fibres; site of lesion (neuropathy versus neuronopathy); calibre of involved fibres (small-fibre versus large-fibre neuropathy); presence of distinctive symptoms (neuropathic pain); involvement of other organs or apparatus. Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, Familial Amyloid Polyneuropathy, Hereditary Sensory and Autonomic Neuropathy, Fabry disease, Tangier disease, Porphyric Neuropathies, Refsum disease, Hereditary Neuropathy with liability to Pressure Palsies, Hereditary Neuralgic Amyotrophy, and other rare disorders involving the peripheral nervous system are reviewed.

### Modelling Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease in a dish reveals common cell type-specific alterations [^112jgFNT]. Brain (2021). Medium credibility.

This scientific commentary refers to 'Induced pluripotent stem cell-derived motor neurons of CMT type 2 patients reveal progressive mitochondrial dysfunction', by Van Lent et al. (doi:).

Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) is one of the most common inherited neurological disorders (∼1 in 2500), and can be caused by mutations in more than 100 nuclear genes. While CMT leads to abnormalities in both sensory and motor nerves, in hereditary motor neuropathies (dHMN) and hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathies (HSAN), it is motor neurons and sensory neurons that are affected, respectively. However, there is an overlap across these conditions.

Mitochondria are essential for the health and viability of both motor and sensory neurons and their axons. Processes that disrupt the distribution and transport of mitochondria along axons will likely give rise to peripheral neuropathies. Axonal transport of mitochondria has been extensively studied in a range of mouse models of CMT, along with changes to neurite networks and neuronal excitability. In fact, mouse models have been generated for most CMT-causing genes and have helped reveal a number of the pathomechanisms underlying the disorder.

More recently, the generation of patient-derived iPSC (induced pluripotent stem cell) lines and their differentiation into less accessible cell types such as neurons has become an established approach for studying disease mechanisms. Since 2015, several studies have been published where CMT iPSC lines have been derived from patient fibroblasts or peripheral blood mononuclear cells. These iPSCs were differentiated mainly into motor neurons or neural crest cells, and each publication focused only on one gene. In this issue of Brain, Van Lent and co-workerspresent the first such study to look at multiple CMT-causing genes and to differentiate the iPSCs into more than one cell type. This approach can help reveal which aspects of the pathomechanism are gene or mutation-specific and which are common to all types of CMT. This information will ultimately be essential for developing therapies for CMT, which can cover multiple CMT subtypes.

### Central nervous system signs in X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease after hyperventilation [^111undh4]. Pediatric Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

The X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is the second most common form of inherited neuropathy and, unlike most other forms of this disease, may present with atypical manifestations because of central nervous system involvement. Episodic central nervous system symptoms in X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease may be triggered by illness, dehydration, physical exercise, or exposure to altitude. We describe a child with transient episodes of hemiplegia after simple hyperventilation, a presentation not previously described in pediatric Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type X.

### Hereditary sensory neuropathies [^115R87TT]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The hereditary sensory neuropathies, also known as the hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathies, are a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of disorders. As they are not as common as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, they do not receive the same level of attention, but there have been major advances in the identification of the causative genes in the past decade. Certain forms of hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy, especially hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type I, which has minimal autonomic involvement and is more accurately termed hereditary sensory neuropathy type I, can present in a very similar fashion to certain forms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 2B, see below), and therefore it is important that clinicians who regularly manage patients with neuropathy are familiar with the latest developments in the hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathies. This review will concentrate on the recent genetic advances in hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy, and especially on those forms that overlap clinically with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, hence the title of the review 'Hereditary sensory neuropathies' rather than hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathies.

### Charcot-Marie-Tooth diseases: an update and some new proposals for the classification [^113e8uWT]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease, the most frequent form of inherited neuropathy, is a genetically heterogeneous group of disorders of the peripheral nervous system, but with a quite homogeneous clinical phenotype (progressive distal muscle weakness and atrophy, foot deformities, distal sensory loss and usually decreased tendon reflexes). Our aim was to review the various CMT subtypes identified at the present time.

Methods

We have analysed the medical literature and performed a historical retrospective of the main steps from the individualisation of the disease (at the end of the nineteenth century) to the recent knowledge about CMT.

Results

To date, > 60 genes (expressed in Schwann cells and neurons) have been implicated in CMT and related syndromes. The recent advances in molecular genetic techniques (such as next-generation sequencing) are promising in CMT, but it is still useful to recognise some specific clinical or pathological signs that enable us to validate genetic results. In this review, we discuss the diagnostic approaches and the underlying molecular pathogenesis.

Conclusions

We suggest a modification of the current classification and explain why such a change is needed.

### Randomized trial of L-serine in patients with hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type 1 [^111YYJsE]. Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Figure 1
Trial profile

Table 1
Demographics and clinical characteristics at baseline

The primary outcome, defined as a > 1 point increase in CMTNS over 1 year, consistent with progression of neuropathy, was achieved by 1 participant in the-serine group (11%) and 2 participants in the placebo group (22%, p = 1.0). Participants randomized to-serine had steady reductions in CMTNS over the 2 years of treatment (mean ± SE change of −1.14 points ± 0.76 between baseline and 2 years, p = 0.15) (figure 2). In contrast, participants taking placebo experienced a mean ± SE increase of 1.1 point ± 0.47 in CMTNS during the first year of the study (p = 0.02). At 1 year,-serine participants experienced a decline in CMTNS relative to those taking placebo (−1.5 units, 95% confidence interval [CI] −2.8 to −0.1, p = 0.03). Both groups improved on-serine treatment during the second year, with the relative difference in the CMTNS unchanged (−1.4 units, 95% CI −3.6 to 0.76, p = 0.19). Combining data from the first year of-serine treatment for all participants (0–48 weeks for the-serine group and 48–96 weeks for the placebo group) suggested a consistent treatment effect (−0.6 points on the CMTNS, p = 0.08, 95% CI −1.3 to 0.08), with no difference depending on the timing of treatment initiation (p = 0.52). In addition to the CMTNS, we also examined the Charcot-Marie-Tooth Examination Score (CMTES), a subscore of the CMTNS, calculated as the sum of the symptoms and signs with exclusion of the electrophysiologic measures. The CMTES showed similar results to CMTNS (relative change of −1.2 points, 95% CI −2.4 to 0.0, p = 0.05 at 1 year, and 0.83 points, 95% CI −2.7 to 1.0, p = 0.37 at 2 years), suggesting that electrophysiologic findings did not contribute importantly to treatment response.

### Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease: an update [^1122xzYz]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The purpose of this review is to assist neurologists, neuroscientists and other interested readers in following the expanding volume of information relating to the inherited peripheral neuropathies collectively referred to as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. Currently, mutations in multiple different genes expressed in Schwann cells and neurons cause a variety of overlapping clinical phenotypes.

Recent Findings

Recent articles clarify molecular pathways involved in the pathogenesis of these disorders, and for the first time provide rational treatment strategies for the most common form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. The identification of many new genes associated with neuropathy demonstrate the role of axonal transport and abnormal protein trafficking in causing various forms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth. They also further define the role of axonal signaling and the molecular architecture of both Schwann cells and neurons in maintaining normal peripheral nervous system function. Finally, recent reports have shown that progesterone antagonists and ascorbic acid can successfully treat rodent models of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A.

Summary

Taken together, results from these articles support the concept that genetic causes of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease serve as a living microarray system to identify molecules necessary for normal peripheral nervous system function. When we can make sense of these microarrays we are likely to understand the pathogenesis and develop rational therapies for many neurodegenerative diseases including Charcot-Marie-Tooth.

### Challenges in modelling the Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathies for therapy development [^112hXL4q]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Based on electrophysiological criteria and the cell type affected, CMT is broadly classified into two major subgroups, CMT1 and CMT2. CMT1 is a demyelinating peripheral neuropathy affecting primarily the myelinating Schwann cells and is further characterised by slow nerve conduction velocities (NCV) (< 38 m/s in patients). CMT2, on the other hand, is characterised by axonal degeneration and NCVs are within the normal (> 40–45 m/s) or occasionally in the mildly abnormal range (30–40 m/s). Compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitudes, reflecting the degree of axonal damage in motor nerves, are found to be reduced in patients with CMT2. However, it is important to note that axonal loss is a feature of both CMT2 and CMT1 and it is the major determinant of disability in patients with CMT, even when axonal loss is secondary to demyelination. To further complicate the phenotypic classification of CMT, intermediate forms (DI-CMT) which demonstrate overlapping electrophysiological and neuropathological features between CMT1 and CMT2, even within the same family, have been increasingly recognised in recent years. Mutations in over 120 genes have been found to be associated with the pathogenesis of CMT and related neuropathies, with most of them being unveiled in the past 25 years owing to the rapid advancement in molecular genetics and next generation sequencing technology. Mutations that cause CMT can affect genes that have specific functions in Schwann cells or neurons, but can also affect ubiquitously expressed genes. A list of CMT associated genes in conjunction with specific variant information can be found at the Inherited Neuropathy Variant Browser (INVB;). These mutations can be inherited in an autosomal-dominant, X linked or autosomal recessive manner and also include mitochondrial DNA mutations. Because of this heterogeneity, the current OMIM nomenclature used to classify CMT neuropathies in different subtypes became unclear and confusing. Therefore, a new CMT classification system has been recently proposed but it still needs general acceptance by clinicians and scientists (table 1). Important to note is that overlapping phenotypes exist; patients exhibiting demyelination of peripheral nerves usually show signs of secondary axonal degeneration, as noted above. In addition, the overlap in the genetic and phenotypic spectrum of CMT with distal hereditary motor neuropathies (dHMN), hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathies, spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSP), mitochondrial and other neuromuscular disorders further increase the complexity.

### Human sensorimotor organoids derived from healthy and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis stem cells form neuromuscular junctions [^115a2fbe]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Diseases of the sensorimotor system bear large non-cell-autonomous effects from many cell types. For spinal muscular atrophy and ALS, astrocytes, microglia, and muscle may all contribute to motor neuron injury –; in chronic pain, the effects of microglia show unexpected sex-dependent differences. Given the extensive number of causal and modifier genes for ALS, Charcot-Marie Tooth neuropathies, and hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathies (HSANs), one might anticipate that non-cell-autonomous contributions vary among disease and even disease subgroups. While co-culture experiments have demonstrated some non-cell autonomous toxicities, specification of non-cell-autonomous phenotypes and pathology can require elaborate interactions among multiple diverse cell types, for example, microglia, astrocytes, and neurons. Compared with efforts to culture several cell types togetheror use remaining multipotent cells to perform sequential differentiations, the organoid approach may actually improve variance by avoiding separate batch effects that arise from the generation of each cell type independently. We did not address the integration of cell types beyond motor neurons and muscle at the NMJ, such as to what extent the astrocytes or microglia exerted non-cell-autonomous effects or whether the vascular cells contributed broad vascularization and even capacity for blood-brain barrier modeling as has been seen in co-culture studies. Our study provided only limited molecular and transcriptional resolution of cell subtypes present at later points in the culture. Given the observed NMJ phenotypes, we now anticipate that additional single-cell sequencing as well as tissue-specific cell sorting or RiboTag labelingof individual cell classes will help evaluate the presence and maturation of distinct cell types, as well as identify within-batch cell type-specific transcriptomic ALS features and thus help improve understanding of non-cell-autonomous effects for different disease-causing mutations and genetic backgrounds.

### Hereditary neuropathies [^117UsSfP]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The purpose of this review is to help neurologists understand new concepts in hereditary neuropathies, from the clinician's point of view, in the molecular era after the burst of information regarding peripheral nerve biology.

Recent Findings

Recent studies have focused on understanding the pathomechanisms involved in hereditary neuropathies. In the past year identification of new genes has slowed down since scientists have concentrated more on the function of genes causing Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and Schwann cell-axon interactions to reveal the molecular cell biology of the disease. Animal models for the most common subtypes of human Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease are now available.

Summary

Rapid advances in the molecular genetics and cell biology of hereditary neuropathies have highlighted the great genetic complexity of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. The evolution from a simple clinical classification to a complex molecular one has not facilitated our understanding of the disease. Moreover, the new molecular classification is not simple to use as different mutations of the same gene produce a range of phenotypes. The clinicians have to look for specific clinical and electrophysiological clues to direct the patient to appropriate genetic testing.

### Painful peripheral neuropathies of the lower limbs and / or lower extremities treated with spinal cord stimulation: a systematic review with narrative synthesis [^111Vsk7M]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Neuropathies are common neurological diseases, with an estimated prevalence of between 1% and 12% in all age groups and higher rates in older people. Etiologies are diverse; nevertheless, the unifying feature is damage to the peripheral nervous system, resulting in either motor, sensory or autonomic dysfunction. Common causes of peripheral neuropathies include Carpal tunnel syndrome, Bells' palsy, diabetes mellitus, toxic exposure (eg, oncologic therapy), and hereditary polyneuropathy (eg, Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease). Sensory and/or motor nerves are the most often affected, with common neurological symptoms including burning pain, numbness, paresthesia, muscle weakness and atrophy, and gait abnormalities.

Neuropathic pain is prevalent in peripheral neuropathy, affecting up to two-thirds of patients and severely impairing quality of life. Currently, oral pharmacotherapy is the mainstay of treatment, with gabapentinoids, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and tricyclic antidepressants being the main recommended medications for symptom relief. However, these drugs generally have limited efficacy, and tolerability is often poor due to their systemic or centrally mediated effects. Other localized agents are also used in drug-refractory patients, including an 8% capsaicin patch recently approved by the FDA for the management of painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN). However, overall, many patients are left with unrelieved pain. Furthermore, the unmet need for efficacious treatments in patients with painful peripheral neuropathy (PPN) is set to increase, with the rising prevalence of diabetes a major contributing factor.

### Pediatric Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease [^113675MY]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Heritable diseases of the peripheral nerves (Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease [CMT]) affect the motor units and sensory nerves, and they are among the most prevalent genetic conditions in the pediatric patient population. The typical clinical presentation includes distal muscle weakness and atrophy, but the severity and progression are largely variable. Improvements in supportive treatment have led to better preservation of patients' motor functions. More than 80 genes have been associated with CMT. These genetic discoveries, along with the developments of cellular and transgenic disease models, have allowed clinicians to better understand the disease mechanisms, which should lead to more specific treatments.

### Removing the idiopathic from the chronic sensory neuropathies [^114xYEFy]. Brain (2021). Medium credibility.

Peripheral neuropathies are common. Estimated to affect around 2.4% of the general population, rising to 8% in those over the age of 55, neuropathies can cause significant morbidity, and can sometimes be fatal. Peripheral nerves consist of motor nerves that convey motor signals from the spinal cord to the peripheries, sensory nerves that convey sensory signals from the peripheries to the CNS, along with sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve fibres that together make up the autonomic nervous system. While neuropathies can be classified into acute and chronic forms, they can also present symmetrically or in an asymmetric manner. Moreover, using neurophysiological and pathological criteria, neuropathies are often classified into demyelinating or axonal forms, reflecting the principal site of pathology as the myelin-forming Schwann cell or the axon, respectively. Furthermore, neuropathies can be classified into those that are inherited, such as the Charcot-Marie-Tooth and related disorders, and those believed to be acquired. Of the latter group, the commonest risk factor associated with an acquired peripheral neuropathy seen in European populations is diabetes mellitus, while infectious and toxic causes remain prevalent worldwide. Nevertheless, despite careful and thorough investigation, it is estimated that between 20% and 40% of neuropathies that present to the clinic have no identifiable cause — hence the longstanding and common use of 'idiopathic' or 'cryptogenic' — and are now grouped together under the diagnostic label of 'chronic idiopathic axonal polyneuropathy' (CIAP).

The CIAPs mainly present with sensorimotor involvement (where both sensory and motor symptoms and signs exist), but a pure sensory neuropathy has also long been recognized, along with a rarer pure motor syndrome. Onset of symptoms is generally in the fifth decade and electrophysiological and histopathological studies are consistent with axonal degeneration. These neuropathies tend to deteriorate slowly and management is currently supportive and focused on symptoms. Previous observational studies aimed at identifying latent underlying risk factors and causes have been largely unsuccessful, hindering efforts to develop effective therapies.

In contrast, many other forms of neuropathy are treatable. While acquired inflammatory neuropathies are commonly managed with immunomodulation, the past decade has seen the development of novel yet effective therapies for previously untreatable inherited neuropathies. These treatments are the culmination of years of scientific investigation which began with the discovery of mutations in disease-associated genes in affected families, followed by the deciphering of molecular pathological mechanisms at the cellular level, leading finally to the identification of potential therapeutic pathways amenable to pharmacological targeting.

### The expanding clinical and genetic spectrum of DYNC1H1-related disorders [^113dL2L2]. Brain (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Here we describe the currently largest cohort of 47 patients, with 41 variants in DYNC1H1, of which 14 variants have not previously been reported. As novel features we report involvement of the sensory and autonomic nervous system evolving throughout life, in line with recent molecular insights into the consequences of dynein motor complex dysfunction, with global effects on axonal transport mechanisms. Defects in axonemal and cytoplasmic dynein subunits mostly cause a combination of immunological, skeletal and neurological disorders. Some of these disorders may fall under the umbrella of 'ciliopathies' with differential diagnoses including Kartagener syndrome or Meckel syndrome. However, until now, the cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain disorders have largely been reported as neurological disorders with differential diagnoses including diseases with brain malformations (lissencephalies), motor neuropathies in the central (5q-spinal muscular atrophy) and the peripheral nervous system (Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease). We discuss the intricate interactions between the dynein complex and viral infections with its implications for neuronal health, based on our observation how viral infections correlated with altered disease courses in some cases regardless of NDD severity or age at viral infection. Our findings extend the clinical, molecular and imaging spectrum of pathogenic DYNC1H1 variants, and suggest an extended phenotypical spectrum presenting throughout life.

### Ascorbic acid for the treatment of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease [^115WGETC]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) comprises a large group of different forms of hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy. The molecular basis of several CMT subtypes has been clarified during the last 20 years. Since slowly progressive muscle weakness and sensory disturbances are the main features of these syndromes, treatments aim to improve motor impairment and sensory disturbances to improve abilities. Pharmacological treatment trials in CMT are rare. This review was derived from a Cochrane review, Treatment for Charcot Marie Tooth disease, which will be updated via this review and a forthcoming title, Treatments other than ascorbic acid for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease.

Objectives

To assess the effects of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) treatment for CMT.

Search Methods

On 21 September 2015, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE and LILACS for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of treatment for CMT. We also checked clinical trials registries for ongoing studies.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs and quasi-RCTs of any ascorbic acid treatment for people with CMT. Where a study aimed to evaluate the treatment of general neuromuscular symptoms of people with peripheral neuropathy including CMT, we included the study if we were able to identify the effect of treatment in the CMT group. We did not include observational studies or case reports of ascorbic acid treatment in people with CMT.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors (BG and JB) independently extracted the data and assessed study quality.

Main Results

Six RCTs compared the effect of oral ascorbic acid (1 to 4 grams) and placebo treatment in CMT1A. In five trials involving adults with CMT1A, a total of 622 participants received ascorbic acid or placebo. Trials were largely at low risk of bias. There is high-quality evidence that ascorbic acid does not improve the course of CMT1A in adults as measured by the CMT neuropathy score (0 to 36 scale) at 12 months (mean difference (MD) -0.37; 95% confidence intervals (CI) -0.83 to 0.09; five studies; N = 533), or at 24 months (MD -0.21; 95% CI -0.81 to 0.39; three studies; N = 388). Ascorbic acid treatment showed a positive effect on the nine-hole peg test versus placebo (MD -1.16 seconds; 95% CI -1.96 to -0.37), but the clinical significance of this result is probably small. Meta-analyses of other secondary outcome parameters showed no relevant benefit of ascorbic acid. In one trial, 80 children with CMT1A received ascorbic acid or placebo. The trial showed no clinical benefit of ascorbic acid treatment. Adverse effects did not differ in their nature or abundance between ascorbic acid and placebo.

Authors' Conclusions

High-quality evidence indicates that ascorbic acid does not improve the course of CMT1A in adults in terms of the outcome parameters used. According to low-quality evidence, ascorbic acid does not improve the course of CMT1A in children. However, CMT1A is slowly progressive and the outcome parameters show only small change over time. Longer study durations should be considered, and outcome parameters more sensitive to change over time should be designed and validated for future studies.

### Charcot-Marie-Tooth-like presentation in giant axonal neuropathy: clinical variability and prevalence in a large Japanese case series [^117Y9jpz]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Of the four families, two exhibited the classical GAN phenotype, including peripheral neuropathy and additional systemic manifestations, whereas the other two families exhibited a phenotype primarily characterized by peripheral neuropathy, resembling CMT. Classical GAN is typically a severe disorder, often resulting in mortality within the second to third decades of life. Conversely, the CMT-like phenotype is generally typified by a more indolent disease course and more favorable life expectancy. In a large cohort of 45 patients, 10 (22.2%) exhibited a CMT-like phenotype with minimal or no CNS involvement. In the same study, the mean age of onset for classical GAN and CMT-like phenotype were 2.3 and 5.4 years, respectively, concurrent with the older age of onset for the CMT-like phenotype in the present study. Following a similar trend, Patient 3 survived until 72 years old, which, to our knowledge, marks the longest survival of a patient with GAN in the English-language literature. Patient 3 did not exhibit hair abnormalities; however, he predominantly presented with lower-limb motor dysfunction, sensory impairment, and diminished deep tendon reflexes, consistent with a childhood-onset CMT phenotype. By 17 years of age, he required a wheelchair. Moreover, autonomic dysfunction emerged in adulthood, with bladder dysfunction, intestinal dysmotility, sleep apnea, and apparent CNS involvement presenting at 43, ~ 50, 54 years, and 61 years of age, respectively. The findings in this patient suggest that even in mild phenotypic presentations primarily characterized by peripheral neuropathy without overt systemic involvement, central and autonomic nervous system manifestations can develop with age. This observation supports the concept of a phenotypic continuum between classical GAN and its CMT-like variant, highlighting the need for long-term clinical surveillance in patients with atypical presentations.

### The various Charcot-Marie-Tooth diseases [^115L3zYK]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review focuses on recent advances in the diagnostic approaches and the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease. We also discuss the emerging therapies for this hereditary neuropathy.

Recent Findings

To date, numerous genes are implicated in CMT, and new genes have recently been found to be associated with this neuropathy (INF2, FBLN5, etc.). Some specific or evocative clinical signs of CMT subtypes (proteinuria with INF2 mutations, etc.) have been identified. Characteristic pathological findings, which may suggest gene mutations, are also recognized by nerve biopsy (mainly ultrastructural lesions).

Summary

CMT disease is the most common inherited neuromuscular disorder, with a fairly homogeneous clinical phenotype (progressive distal muscle weakness and atrophy, foot deformities, distal sensory loss, and depressed tendon reflexes). With more than 40 genes implicated, an update of the present and rather confusing classification of CMT is needed. Over the last few years, new mutated genes have been discovered. Although nerve biopsy is not routinely carried out in CMT neuropathies, it may show characteristic features, which can orientate the search for the mutated gene. There are currently no effective medications for CMT, but clinical trials are ongoing or planned.

### Genes for hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathies: a genotype-phenotype correlation [^116MtD22]. Brain (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathies (HSAN) are a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of inherited peripheral neuropathies, primarily affecting the peripheral sensory and autonomic neurons (Dyck). Patients usually exhibit prominent distal sensory loss with manifest insensitivity to pain in some. The prominent distal sensory loss frequently leads to chronic ulcerations in feet and hands, sometimes resulting in severe complications such as extensive soft tissue infections, osteomyelitis necessitating amputations of toes and fingers or, in rare instances, even of more proximal parts of the extremities (Dyck). Autonomic dysfunction, such as anhidrosis, fever, blood pressure fluctuations and gastro-intestinal disturbances are present in some patients. Electrophysiologically, axonal nerve damage of the sensory neurons is often found, but additional demyelination may also be present (Auer-Grumbach et al.).

HSAN can be transmitted as an autosomal dominant (AD) or autosomal recessive (AR) trait. Isolated patients have also been described (Dyck; Auer-Grumbach). The AD types of HSAN usually present in the second or third decade of life with marked sensory involvement and minimal autonomic and variable motor involvement, while AR HSAN present either as congenital syndromes with striking sensory and autonomic abnormalities or as almost pure autonomic disorders (Verpoorten et al.).

A classification of the hereditary sensory neuropathies into types HSAN I–V (Dyck,) was made based on age at onset, inheritance pattern and additional features. Although the clinical classification of these HSAN types is based on a small number of individuals, it still stands after the molecular characterization of the subtypes in recent years. There is variable motor involvement in the AD form of HSAN, making the distinction with hereditary motor and sensory neuropathies (HMSN) or Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) difficult. In CMT2B, sensory loss and the associated ulcerations are such prominent phenotypic features that inclusion within the HSAN-spectrum is justified (Vance et al; Verpoorten et al.). However, due to the concomitant motor involvement with distal muscle atrophy and weakness, this phenotype was originally classified as HMSN (Kwon et al.).

### Genetic profile and onset features of 1005 patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease in Japan [^111RJeAp]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) is the most common phenotype of inherited peripheral neuropathy (IPN), the latter of which also encompass hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy, hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy and hereditary motor neuropathy (HMN). In terms of median motor nerve conduction velocity (MNCV), CMT can be further classified into demyelinating CMT (MNCV < 38 m/s) and axonal CMT (MNCV ≥ 38 m/s).

CMT is typically characterised by progressive motor and sensory polyneuropathy, but it may also present with significant clinical heterogeneity. CMT disease-causing genes, such as GARS (CMT2D and distal HMN5A), HSPB1 (CMT2F and distal HMN2B) or IGHMBP2 (CMT2S and spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress type 1), often produce other IPN phenotypes. To date, approximately 100 different genes have been linked to CMT-like phenotypes. Owing to its clinical complexity and genetic diversity, the clinical subtyping of CMT is always laborious and difficult.

The development of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology allows us to conduct gene panel sequencing simultaneously the targeting of numerous genes. Within approximately 4 years, using two NGS systems successively, we have completed genetic assessment in more than 1000 Japanese cases with suspected CMT, which enables us to describe the genetic and clinical features of these cases.

### Genetics of inherited peripheral neuropathies and the next frontier: looking backwards to progress forwards [^112xCcay]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Inherited peripheral neuropathies (IPNs) are a group of inherited diseases affecting the peripheral nervous system with a wide range of symptoms, clinical severity and causes. IPNs show all modes of inheritance (autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, X-linked and mitochondrial) and are grouped depending on the peripheral neurons involved: hereditary motor and sensory neuropathies, hereditary motor neuropathies (HMN) and hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathies (HSAN). The most common form is hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy (also known as Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) neuropathy) with a prevalence of 1 in 2500.CMT is divided into demyelinating (CMT1), axonal (CMT2) or intermediate (CMTi) depending on the pathophysiology. In CMT1, the primary pathology is degeneration of the myelin sheath leading to nerve conduction velocity (NCV) reduction, whereas axon degeneration, leaving NCV intact, is the primary pathology in CMT2. In CMTi, NCVs overlap both CMT1 and CMT2, and may show pathology of both CMT1 and CMT2. Patients with IPN may present with features additional to neuropathy, including metabolic or mitochondrial dysfunction, neurodegenerative disorders including hereditary ataxias, and leukodystrophy; or may be part of a complex multisystem disorder.

### Advances and challenges in modeling inherited peripheral neuropathies using iPSCs [^115gm1tS]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Inherited peripheral neuropathies (IPNs) are a group of diseases characterized by the degeneration of motor and sensory nerves of the peripheral nervous system. Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) neuropathy, also known as hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy (HMSN), is the most common IPN, affecting approximately 1 in 2500 people worldwide. Since it was first reported in 1886, progress in characterizing CMT has led to the identification of a clinically diverse and genetically heterogeneous group of disorders with more than 1000 mutations in more than 100 distinct CMT disease-associated genes. Other IPN subtypes include hereditary motor neuropathy (HMN) and hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy (HSAN), in which motor and sensory neurons are affected, respectively (Fig. 1). Patients typically present with length-dependent degeneration primarily affecting the longest peripheral axons, resulting in progressive sensory loss, muscle weakness and atrophy of distal limb muscles. CMT is broadly classified into demyelinating (CMT1) and axonal (CMT2) forms based on electrophysiological criteria and reflecting primary deficits occurring in myelinating Schwann cells or neuronal axons, respectively. Patients with intermediate CMT subtypes exhibit both demyelination and axonal pathology.

### Small nerve fiber involvement in CMT1A [^113hL71y]. Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the involvement of small nerve fibers in Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1A (CMT1A).

Methods

We used indirect immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy on punch biopsies from glabrous (fingertip) and hairy (thigh and leg) skin of 20 unrelated patients with CMT1A to quantify somatic and autonomic nerve fibers. In particular, we quantified epidermal nerve fibers (ENF), Meissner corpuscles (MC), intrapapillary myelinated endings (IME), and sudomotor nerves. We correlated morphologic data with findings from quantitative sensory testing, sudomotor output, sympathetic skin response, and cardiovascular reflexes. A control population of healthy age- and sex-matched controls was included with a matching ratio of 1:2.

Results

We found a length-dependent loss of ENFs that worsened with aging. We also observed a loss of MCs, IMEs, and sudomotor nerves. The loss of ENF at distal leg correlated with the increase in heat-pain thresholds (p < 0.05) and with tactile thresholds (p < 0.05). Sudomotor nerve fiber loss correlated with ENF density (p < 0.05) and sweating output (p < 0.001).

Conclusions

We demonstrated through morphologic, physical, and psychophysical testing that small somatic and autonomic fibers are abnormal and cause symptoms in patients with CMT1A. Awareness of such symptoms by the clinician could lead to better treatment.

### The evolving spectrum of complex inherited neuropathies [^1112kUQj]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose of review

Inherited peripheral neuropathies can be divided into those diseases in which peripheral neuropathy is the sole or main feature of the disease (Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease) and those in which peripheral neuropathy is just one feature of a more complex syndrome. In recent years there has been a substantial expansion in the number of genes associated with complex neuropathy syndromes.

Recent findings

This review will focus on emerging themes in this group of diseases, namely the increasing number of diseases due to repeat expansions; the emergence of both recessive and dominant negative alleles in the same gene producing a common phenotype and diseases in which there is selective loss of the allele from haematopoietic stem cells making genetic diagnosis on blood derived DNA problematic.

Summary

In this review we provide a practical approach to investigating and diagnosing patients with peripheral neuropathy as part of a complex syndrome and provide an updated table of the genes associated with this group of diseases.

### Mutations in MYO9B are associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2 neuropathies and isolated optic atrophy [^112uuksB]. European Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Inherited peripheral neuropathies (IPNs) are a heterogeneous group of disorders that may be part of more complicated syndromes. Patients with IPNs present distal motor and/or sensory deficits that progress with age. When neuropathy is the predominant finding, then the IPN is usually classified as Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease (CMT), distal hereditary motor neuropathy (HMN; or distal spinal muscular atrophy), or hereditary sensory autonomic neuropathy (HSAN). When additional findings (such as encephalopathy, spasticity, ataxia, cranial nerve involvement, or myopathy) dominate the clinical phenotype, the disorder is usually given a different name. Of particular interest here is the association of CMT and optic atrophy (OA). OA is found in some patients with CMT2A (which is caused by dominant MFN2 mutations), and in all patients with OPA1 (caused by dominant OPA1 mutations), but 50%–60% of OA patients (isolated or combined with other neurological issues) lack a genetic diagnosis.

### Membrane-shaping disorders: a common pathway in axon degeneration [^1137wUBW]. Brain (2014). Low credibility.

Neurons with long projections are particularly liable to damage, which is reflected by a large group of hereditary neurodegenerative disorders that primarily affect these neurons. In the group of hereditary spastic paraplegias motor axons of the central nervous system degenerate, while distal pure motor neuropathies, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disorders and the group of hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathies are characterized by degeneration of peripheral nerve fibres. Because the underlying pathologies share many parallels, the disorders are also referred to as axonopathies. A large number of genes has been associated with axonopathies and one of the emerging subgroups encodes membrane-shaping proteins with a central reticulon homology domain. Association of these proteins with lipid bilayers induces positive membrane curvature and influences the architecture of cellular organelles. Membrane-shaping proteins closely cooperate and directly interact with each other, but their structural features and localization to distinct subdomains of organelles suggests mutually exclusive roles. In some individuals a mutation in a shaping protein can result in upper motor neuron dysfunction, whereas in other patients it can lead to a degeneration of peripheral neurons. This suggests that membrane-shaping disorders might be considered as a continuous disease-spectrum of the axon.

### New keys to early diagnosis: muscle echogenicity, nerve ultrasound patterns, electrodiagnostic, and clinical parameters in 150 patients with hereditary polyneuropathies [^112baegD]. Neurotherapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hereditary neuropathies are a variable group of progressively disabling diseases, the diagnostic recognition of which is becoming increasingly important because of upcoming treatment approaches.

With an approximate worldwide prevalence of 1 in 2500 individuals, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) forms the largest subgroup of hereditary neuropathies. Mutations in more than 80 different genes are known to cause CMT. The typical phenotype encompasses distal symmetric muscle weakness and atrophy, foot deformities such as pes cavus, sensory loss, and reduced or absent tendon reflexes. Corresponding to nerve conduction studies (NCS) and mode of inheritance, a sub-classification into the types CMT 1–4 has been traditionally applied. The most common CMT subtype, CMT1A, is caused by a heterozygous duplication on chromosome 17p12 including the entire PMP22 gene. A combination of sorbitol, naltrexone, and baclofen is currently in trials for CMT1A. Hereditary transthyretin-related (TTR) amyloidosis is a progressive, systemic disease, that initially manifests with a mixed sensorimotor and autonomic neuropathy. The tetramer-stabilizing small molecule tafamidis, as well as the RNA-silencing drugs patisiran and inotersen significantly improve the clinical course, especially when administered early. Another potentially treatable hereditary polyneuropathy is Fabry's disease, which can manifest with a pure or leading small fiber involvement. Depending on the underlying mutation, approved medications like the chaperone migalastat or an enzyme replacement therapy are available to treat affected mutation carriers, respectively. However, in most types of hereditary neuropathies, therapeutic concepts are still lacking.

For both clinical trials and practice, it is crucial to have valid parameters to identify a specific disease and measure its progression. The traditional neurological examination depends, however, on both the patient's compliance and the investigator's experience. Nerve conduction studies (NCS) provide valuable functional information, but are unpleasant for the patient. In cases of advanced axonal damage and loss of nerve stimulability, a classification might no longer be possible. Nerve biopsies might still represent the gold standard to substantiate a certain nerve pathology, but they focus on sensory nerves and cannot be used for follow-up. This fosters the need of another, non-invasive, reproducible, and repeatable method as a representative add-on.

High-resolution nerve ultrasound (HRUS) has recently been introduced to characterize immune-mediated neuropathies and nerve injuries. A diagnostic algorithm for all common subtypes of polyneuropathies is still lacking.

### Disease mutations in rab7 result in unregulated nucleotide exchange and inappropriate activation [^115i3APs]. Human Molecular Genetics (2010). Low credibility.

Rab7 is a ubiquitously expressed protein that plays a vital role in the regulation of the trafficking, maturation and fusion of endocytic and autophagic vesicles. Rab7 localizes primarily to acidic, pre-degradative and degradative organelles such as late endosomes, lysosomes, multivesicular bodies, phagosomes, autophagosomes and autophagolysosomes. Rab7 specifically controls the transition of early endosomes into the late-endosomal/lysosomal system and subsequent degradation of cargos associated with target vesicles. As such, Rab7 activity regulates the lysosome-mediated degradation of endocytic cargos such as activated EGF receptors, internalized cholesterol and neurotrophic factor receptors such as TrkA. In addition, fusion of autophagic vacuoles with lysosomes requires Rab7 activity. Rab7 has also been implicated in the regulation of long-range axonal trafficking. Although there is no consensus as to the exact role of Rab7 in axonal transport, evidence suggests that Rab5 and Rab7 together regulate the retrograde trafficking of signaling endosomes that supply trophic support to neurons in the peripheral nervous system.

Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease comprises a heterogeneous group of inherited peripheral neuropathies. Patients with CMT present with length-dependent sensory, motor or autonomic dysfunction either alone or in combination. Two major subtypes of CMT are recognized and distinguished by the primary pathology. CMT type 1 is characterized by prominent demyelination and decreased nerve conduction velocities and is most commonly caused by mutations in myelin-specific proteins. In contrast, the primary pathological feature in CMT type 2 is axonal degeneration. Although genetic mutations that cause CMT type 2 affect a variety of cellular processes, defects in mitochondrial physiology, chaperone activity and axonal transport pathways are most commonly implicated. To date, four missense mutations in Rab7 have been associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2B (OMIM 600882). This subtype of CMT is distinguished by profound loss of pain sensation leading to recurrent ulcers, deformities and frequent need for amputation of the lower limbs. As such, CMT2B is alternatively classified as ulcero-mutilating neuropathy. Degeneration of motor neurons and subsequent muscle weakness are also associated with CMT2B.

Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, a heterogeneous hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy

Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy (CMT) is the most common hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy with an estimated worldwide prevalence of 1 in 2500. The disease was named after the three neurologists, Jean-Martin Charcot, Pierre Marie and Howard Henry Tooth, who first described the disease in 1886.CMT is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disease, affecting both children and adults. Patients typically exhibit a slowly progressive and length-dependent degeneration of their peripheral nerves resulting in muscle weakness, atrophy in the feet and legs which extend later to the hands, causing reduced tendon reflexes and slight to moderate distal sensory impairment. Foot deformities like pes cavus (high-arched foot deformity) is among the frequently reported manifestations of CMT, with patients sometimes also exhibiting hearing loss and hip dysplasia. These and other additional symptoms that mark the different CMT subtypes may cause a significant decrease in the quality of life of affected individuals.

### Natural history and biomarkers in hereditary sensory neuropathy type 1 [^117LkUiJ]. Muscle & Nerve (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type 1 (HSAN1) is most commonly caused by missense mutations in SPTLC1. In this study we mapped symptom progression and compared the utility of outcomes.

Methods

We administered retrospective surveys of symptoms and analyzed results of nerve conduction, autonomic function testing (AFT), and PGP9.5-immunolabeled skin biopsies.

Results

The first symptoms were universally sensory and occurred at a median age of 20 years (range 14–54 years). The onset of weakness, ulcers, pain, and balance problems followed sequentially. Skin biopsies revealed universally absent epidermal innervation at the distal leg with relative preservation in the thigh. Neurite density was highly correlated with total Charcot-Marie-Tooth Examination Score (CMTES; r² = -0.8) and median motor amplitude (r² = -0.75).

Conclusions

These results confirm sensory loss as the initial symptom of HSAN1 and suggest that skin biopsy may be the most promising biomarker for future clinical trials.

### Diagnostic nerve ultrasound in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1B [^1148pEWA]. Muscle & Nerve (2009). Low credibility.

Ultrasound is emerging as a useful tool for evaluation of neuromuscular conditions, because it can provide high-resolution anatomic information to complement electrodiagnostic data. There have been few studies in which ultrasound was used to assess the peripheral nerves of individuals with Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease and none involving CMT type 1B. In this study we compared nerve cross-sectional area in individuals from a single large family with CMT 1B with normal, healthy controls. We also assessed for cranial nerve enlargement in those with CMT 1B with cranial neuropathies compared to those with CMT 1B without cranial neuropathies. Individuals with CMT 1B have significantly larger median and vagus nerves than healthy controls, but no difference was seen in cranial nerve size between those with versus those without cranial neuropathies. This is the first study to characterize the ultrasonographic findings in the peripheral nerves of individuals with CMT 1B.

### Dominantly inherited peripheral neuropathies [^115Z5HV6]. Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

Since 1886, the year that Charcot and Marie and Tooth described a genetic "peroneal muscular atrophy syndrome", electrophysiological and histological studies of the peripheral nervous system have greatly aided the characterization of this syndrome, which falls among the hereditary sensory-motor neuropathies. Two principal forms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease have been distinguished: CMT 1, corresponding to a demyelinating type, and CMT 2, corresponding to an axonal type. The modes of transmission of these types are variable, recessive or dominant, autosomal, or X-linked. Our discussion here is confined to the dominant forms. In recent years, advances in molecular biology have greatly modified the approach to CMT disease and related neuropathies (such as hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies). With increased knowledge of responsible gene mutations and several other loci identified by linkage studies, our understanding of the pathophysiology of these neuropathies is increasing; however, with greater understanding, the classification of these disorders is becoming more complex. In this review we present and discuss the currently characterized subtypes, with emphasis on their known histological aspects. While nerve biopsy has lost its diagnostic importance in certain forms of the disease, such as CMT 1A, CMT 1B, and X-linked CMT (CMT X), it remains important for better characterizing the lesions of CMT 2 and forms of genetic peroneal atrophy in which DNA study is unrevealing.

X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMTX) is the second common genetic variant of CMT. CMTX type 1 causes 90% of CMTX. The most important clinical features of CMTX are similar with other types of CMT; however, a few patients get the central nervous system involved with or without white matter lesions; males are more severely and earlier affected than females. In this review, the authors focus on the origin and classification of CMTX, the central nervous system manifestations of CMTX1, the possible mechanism by which GJB1 mutations cause CMT1X, and the emerging therapeutic strategies for CMTX. Moreover, several cases are presented to illustrate the central nervous system manifestations.

### Neurofibromatosis type 1 associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1A [^112B3Yig]. The Journal of Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Neurofibromatosis and Charcot-Marie-Tooth are genetic disorders of the nervous system affecting the development and growth of nerve cells and demyelination of peripheral neurons, respectively. We report a 22-year-old man who presented clinical manifestations of both neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1A. The simultaneous occurrence of neurofibromatosis and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease has rarely been reported. More extensive reports and further investigations of this combination will certainly provide a better understanding of this linkage in the near future.

### Evaluation of distal symmetric polyneuropathy: the role of autonomic testing, nerve biopsy, and skin biopsy (an evidence-based review) [^111kj9wj]. Muscle & Nerve (2009). Medium credibility.

Distal symmetric polyneuropathy — recommendations for future research emphasize needs around autonomic testing, nerve biopsy, and skin biopsy. Autonomic testing can, with a high degree of accuracy, document autonomic system dysfunction in polyneuropathy and is particularly relevant to small fiber polyneuropathy and the autonomic neuropathies; specific tests such as QSART can document small fiber (i.e., sudomotor axon) loss with a high degree of sensitivity, and since skin biopsy with determination of IENF density can also document small fiber loss, studies are needed to compare and correlate the two techniques. There are no studies of nerve biopsy in the evaluation of DSP, and although outcomes of well-designed prospective studies would be useful, it is unlikely that such studies will be done. Skin biopsy with determination of IENF density has come of age for objective documentation of small fiber loss, and further studies are needed to characterize the diagnostic accuracy of skin biopsy in distinguishing suspected polyneuropathy, particularly SFSN, from sensory complaints or pain unrelated to peripheral neuropathy; prospective studies with appropriate "other disease" controls should be done to assess the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of IENF density measurement to identify SFSN in patients with lower extremity pain or sensory complaints, and a predetermined independent reference standard for the diagnosis of SFSN should be specifically stated. A case definition of SFSN should be developed, with determination of whether it should be based on clinical criteria, pathological criteria (e.g., skin biopsy), or a combination of clinical, paraclinical, and pathologic criteria, and the diagnostic accuracy of morphologic changes (e.g., axonal swellings) versus healthy and disease controls needs to be better defined. Studies exploring other uses for skin biopsy beyond identification and quantification of DSP and SFSN should be further explored; biopsies of glabrous skin and dermal skin include myelinated nerve fibers and have been shown to have potential utility in the diagnosis of immune-mediated neuropathies, Charcot–Marie–Tooth (CMT), and related diseases, and skin biopsy has been employed for detection or monitoring of leprosy, hereditary amyloidosis, vasculitic neuropathy, and Fabry's disease, with additional studies required to determine usefulness for diagnosis and monitoring. Serial IENF density measurements and IENF regenerative capacity are being studied and used as outcome measures in therapeutic trials, and better validation studies are needed to determine the value of skin biopsy for this purpose.

### Hereditary predominantly motor neuropathies [^114Bwdqj]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

We review recent advances in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), the most frequent inherited neuromuscular disorder.

Recent Findings

During the last year further progresses have occurred in this field and concerned identification of novel mutations in recently identified genes, allowing better definition of associated phenotypes; increased knowledge on pathophysiologic mechanisms of the different CMT types, with the contribution of cellular and animal model studies; studies on the natural history of CMT and attempts at developing appropriate outcome measures to assess disease course and intervention efficacy; trials with ascorbic acid in CMT type 1A; and studies on new possible therapeutic strategies.

Summary

Such advances have implications on clinical management of CMT and are modifying the clinical approach to CMT, by improving diagnostic tools, allowing better definition of prognosis, and increasing the hope for future effective treatments. Research on CMT is important as is shedding light on important pathways that regulates the normal function of axonal transport, vesicular trafficking, and also revealing new aspects of intracellular organelles' function and interactions.

### Mechanisms and treatments in demyelinating CMT [^117KjSJW]. Neurotherapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Demyelinating forms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) are genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous and result from highly diverse biological mechanisms including gain of function (including dominant negative effects) and loss of function. While no definitive treatment is currently available, rapid advances in defining the pathomechanisms of demyelinating CMT have led to promising pre-clinical studies, as well as emerging clinical trials. Especially promising are the recently completed pre-clinical genetic therapy studies in PMP-22, GJB1, and SH3TC2-associated neuropathies, particularly given the success of similar approaches in humans with spinal muscular atrophy and transthyretin familial polyneuropathy. This article focuses on neuropathies related to mutations in PMP-22, MPZ, and GJB1, which together comprise the most common forms of demyelinating CMT, as well as on select rarer forms for which promising treatment targets have been identified. Clinical characteristics and pathomechanisms are reviewed in detail, with emphasis on therapeutically targetable biological pathways. Also discussed are the challenges facing the CMT research community in its efforts to advance the rapidly evolving biological insights to effective clinical trials. These considerations include the limitations of currently available animal models, the need for personalized medicine approaches/allele-specific interventions for select forms of demyelinating CMT, and the increasing demand for optimal clinical outcome assessments and objective biomarkers.

### The clinical approach to small fibre neuropathy and painful channelopathy [^113tXMmw]. Practical Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

In vivo corneal confocal microscopy shows promise to assess small fibre innervation non-invasively as it can measure and assess corneal innervation. The cornea is innervated by Aδ-fibres and C-fibres that originate from the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve. It is the most densely innervated part of the human body and offers a unique window to small fibre innervation, as corneal living tissue can be assessed at a cellular level. Corneal nerve fibre bundle density and tortuosity have been assessed most extensively in patients with diabetes mellitus, but also in Fabry's disease, Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease, idiopathic SFN and in non-length dependent neuropathy. Corneal nerve fibre bundle density inversely correlates with severity of neuropathy; therefore, the fewer the nerve fibre bundles the more severe the neuropathy.

Autonomic nervous system testing

The objective assessment of the autonomic nervous system is not trivial. If there is suspected autonomic dysfunction on the basis of symptoms and examination, we recommend cardiovascular reflex testing, such as the Ewing protocol, as an initial assessment of the autonomic nervous system, with subsequent referral for a more comprehensive assessment to include tests such as the sympathetic skin response. A further development is that skin biopsies may eventually be used to assess the autonomic nervous system as new techniques have been developed to assess sweat gland and pilomotor muscle innervation, and found to correlate with autonomic dysfunction. However, we need more research before it can be used in routine clinical practice.

Diagnostic approach to SFN

In patients where SFN is suspected, the first step is to confirm the diagnosis by following the diagnostic criteria outlined above (figure 5 and clinical vignette). In patients with a pre-existing risk factor such as diabetes mellitus or HIV, it may not be necessary to investigate further, unless there is a clinical suspicion of an exacerbating factor. In patients with no pre-existing risk factor the investigation of an underlying cause should be systematic and appropriate for the patient population. Possible causes of SFN need to be considered and appropriate investigations organised (table 2). If there is no underlying cause, we recommend referral for screening for an SCN9A mutation, particularly in patients with an onset of symptoms before the age of 40 and a family history.

### Controversies in the management of active Charcot neuroarthropathy [^115FBmyr]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Controversies in the pathogenesis of CN

Historically, the pathogenesis of CN has been explained by two main theories: the neurotrophic/neurovascular and the neurotraumatic theories. The neurotrophic/neurovascular theory was proposed by Charcot. He hypothesised that increased blood flow to the foot, now known to be associated with autonomic neuropathy, leads to bone resorption and bone weakness (osteopenia). The other hypothesis, the neurotraumatic theory, focuses on an insensate joint or bone being subjected to continued, repetitive pressure and trauma. This causes progressive damage to the affected bones and joints which then leads to fractures and deformity. The current controversy and theories surrounding the pathogenesis of CN including the role of RANKL and OPG have been detailed in a recent paper. However, there remains a need for further studies to provided additional understanding on the mechanisms that can lead to some people with diabetes and neuropathy developing CN, while others do not. Figure 1 shows the schematic representation of the current theory of the relationship between neuropathy, trauma, inflammation and osteopenia which leads to CN.

Figure 1.
Schematic representation of the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of CN.

The exact pathogenesis of CN is not fully understood, and it is likely that the causes are multifactorial, with perhaps currently unknown mechanisms contributing to the development of CN. It is not known how to prevent the development of CN, other than maintaining good diabetes control to reduce the risk of the development of neuropathy, which still does not completely eliminate the risk. Further high-quality studies are required to help elucidate the pathogenesis of CN.

### Nerve biopsy is still useful in some inherited neuropathies [^11354v1y]. Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

In hereditary neuropathies, next-generation sequencing techniques are producing a vast number of candidate gene mutations that need to be verified or excluded by careful genotype-phenotype correlation analysis. In most cases, clinical acumen is still important but needs to be combined with data from nerve conduction studies and, in some cases, from nerve biopsy examinations. Indeed, characteristic clinical, electrophysiological, and sometimes pathological features may be suggestive of a particular subtype of Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease. Microscopical (mainly ultrastructural) human nerve biopsy patterns may be related to CMT diseases and gene defects. Even today, it is important to recognize these characteristic lesions in the context of a chronic idiopathic neuropathy as they may help search for or reveal a sporadic form of CMT. In practice, these different types of lesions are often linked to the known function of the mutated genes. Only a few patients diagnosed or suspected as having a CMT disease need a nerve biopsy that can help find or confirm the causative gene mutation. The indication for this procedure should be based on a case-by-case discussion.

### Pathology explains various mechanisms of auto-immune inflammatory peripheral neuropathies [^111TLW53]. Brain Pathology (2024). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Peripheral neuropathies represent a highly prevalent neurological problem in the general population (incidence: 77/100,000 inhabitants/year; prevalence: 1%–12% in all age groups and up to 30% in older people), because of the high prevalence of some etiologies such as diabetes mellitus, alcoholism, neurotoxic substances (medications, chemotherapies), and renal insufficiency. Other rare causes of peripheral neuropathy may be hereditary (Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease, etc.) or acquired (immune‐mediated, neoplastic, infectious, etc.).

Immune‐mediated diseases may affect the peripheral nervous system by various mechanisms (inflammatory, vascular, etc.) being induced by a process involving cellular and humoral immunities. After a presentation of the main normal histological structure of the myelinated nerve fibers, we discuss here the various pathological aspects of some autoimmune neuropathies. The main objective of this presentation is to show that the pathology illustrates, confirms, and may explain various mechanisms concerning this type of neuropathy.

### Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging: a diagnostic tool for auditory (axonal) neuropathy [^111KPSyT]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Axons are the long, thin fibres of neurons that form the wiring of the nervous system. During the ageing process, around 40% of these fibres are lost, including those of the auditory and visual systems. They are also vulnerable to trauma and can undergo premature degeneration due to various acquired or inherited conditions.

Axonal neuropathies (also known as axonopathies) are a diverse group of disorders that impair the nervous system's ability to transmit electrical impulses efficiently. These conditions are often classified based on the diameter of the affected axons: large fibre neuropathies primarily impact motor and some sensory modalities (including touch), whereas small fibre neuropathies affect other sensory modalities and autonomic functions. Within the auditory system, myelinated fibres, with their relatively small diameters (~5–6 μm), are especially susceptible to damage, which can severely disrupt the neural representation of auditory stimuli.

Axonopathies directly impact the magnitude of the compound action potential, which is correlated with the degree of reduction in synchronised neuronal activity due to loss of nerve fibres or secondary demyelination. The resulting disruption in firing patterns, in turn, affects the representation of temporal (timing) information in the central auditory pathways. As a result, speech understanding which is dependent on the precise representation of temporal cues, may be adversely affected. Furthermore, temporal accuracy is crucial for binaural processing, and hence, listening/communication in background noise. Functional hearing deficits involving speech understanding and everyday communication are commonly reported in patients with axonal conditions such as Friedreich ataxia (FRDA), Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease (type 2; CMT2) and riboflavin transporter deficiency (RTD). Moreover, these auditory deficits can often occur in the absence of significantly elevated hearing thresholds.

### MFN2 mutations in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease alter mitochondria-associated ER membrane function but do not impair bioenergetics [^114Qd8KT]. Human Molecular Genetics (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease Type 2A (CMT2A; OMIM #609260) is a neurological disorder that presents as a peripheral neuropathy but involves the central nervous system. This autosomal-dominant disorder is due to heterozygous mutations in the gene encoding mitofusin-2 (MFN2) but occasionally MFN2 mutations are recessive or semi-dominant. Clinically, patients exhibit progressive sensory loss in the extremities and pes cavus, among other features, with the disease presenting as early- or late-onset forms. Studies in relevant tissues, such as sural nerve, have shown consistent phenotypes in which chronic axonal atrophy and subsequent regeneration are often seen. Approximately 100 pathogenic mutations in MFN2 have been described, but there is no understanding of the relationship of clinical phenotype to genotype.

### Mutations in C1orf194, encoding a calcium regulator, cause dominant Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease [^111RADGm]. Brain (2019). Medium credibility.

Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is a hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy exhibiting great clinical and genetic heterogeneity. Here, the identification of two heterozygous missense mutations in the C1orf194 gene at 1p21.2-p13.2 with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease are reported. Specifically, the p. I122N mutation was the cause of an intermediate form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, and the p.K28I missense mutation predominately led to the demyelinating form. Functional studies demonstrated that the p.K28I variant significantly reduced expression of the protein, but the p. I122N variant increased. In addition, the p. I122N mutant protein exhibited the aggregation in neuroblastoma cell lines and the patient's peroneal nerve. Either gain-of-function or partial loss-of-function mutations to C1ORF194 can specify different causal mechanisms responsible for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease with a wide range of clinical severity. Moreover, a knock-in mouse model confirmed that the C1orf194 missense mutation p. I121N led to impairments in motor and neuromuscular functions, and aberrant myelination and axonal phenotypes. The loss of normal C1ORF194 protein altered intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis and upregulated Ca2+ handling regulatory proteins. These findings describe a novel protein with vital functions in peripheral nervous systems and broaden the causes of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, which open new avenues for the diagnosis and treatment of related neuropathies.

### Hereditary motor and sensory neuropathies: a biological perspective [^113bATmH]. The Lancet: Neurology (2002). Medium credibility.

Mutations in genes expressed in Schwann cells and the axons they ensheath cause the hereditary motor and sensory neuropathies known as Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease. At present, mutations in ten different genes have been identified, chromosomal localisation of many other distinct inherited neuropathies has been mapped, and new genetic causes for inherited neuropathies continue to be discovered. How to keep track of these mutations is a challenge for any neurologist, partly because the mutations are commonly presented as an expanding list to be memorised without a biological context of how the encoded proteins behave in the cell. A further challenge for investigators studying diseases of the peripheral nervous system is the increasing complexity of myelination, axonal function, and interactions between Schwann cells and axons. To address these concerns, we present the mutated genes causing these inherited neuropathies in the context of the cell biology of the Schwann cell and axon, and we begin to develop a model of how the various genes may interact in the pathogenesis of CMT disease.

### Treadmill training in patients affected by Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy: results of a multicenter, prospective, randomized, single-blind, controlled study [^115EH4Hq]. European Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Sample size calculation and statistical methods

Power analysis was based on the 10MWT. Hence, the control arm was assumed to have an improvement of 0.5 s in the time needed to walk 10 m (SD, 1 s) and the minimum improvement of clinical interest to detect in the TreSPE arm was set to a minimum of 0.85 s for a total improvement after treatment of ≥ 1.35 s forthe TreSPE arm. With these assumptions and for a statistical power of 80% and a level of significance of 5% (two‐tailed), a minimum of 23 patients per group were required. Assuming an attrition rate of 10%, at least 26 patients per group were needed.

Mean and SD or median (range) were reported for continuous characteristics. Groups were compared at T0 using independent‐samples Student's t ‐test for all quantitative characteristics and chi‐squared test for gender. Linear mixed model with random intercept and corrected per center was used to statistically test the longitudinal change at T1 and T2 of all clinical scales. To assess whether the two treatments had a different effect on longitudinal performances, the interaction term treatment * time was considered in the model. Normality of model residuals was checked graphically. As a skewed distribution was observed for three scales (BBS, SF‐36 limitation of physical role and SF‐36 limitation of emotional role), a linear mixed model was performed after a rank transformation of the scale. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Stata Statistical Software (Release 14. StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA). was used for the computation.

### Peripheral neuropathy: a review [^116ZaC5W]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Peripheral neuropathy, defined as damage to peripheral nerves, affects approximately 1% of adults worldwide. More than 200 causes of peripheral neuropathy exist, with symptoms ranging in severity from mild toe numbness to debilitating symptoms that can require a wheelchair. Diabetes is the most common cause of neuropathy, affecting approximately 206 million people worldwide.

Observations

Peripheral neuropathy is typically length-dependent, which means that symptoms appear in the longest nerve axons (toes) and progress proximally over time. Peripheral neuropathy is typically symmetric and affects sensory axons more than motor axons. Diabetic neuropathy, which is often associated with both sensory symptoms, such as pain, tingling, or numbness; mild weakness; and autonomic symptoms, such as orthostatic hypotension, accounts for more than 50% of peripheral neuropathy in Western populations. Other causes of neuropathy include hereditary causes, such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, toxic neuropathy from medications (chemotherapies [eg, cisplatin, paclitaxel, vincristine], amiodarone, or HIV nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors [eg, stavudine, zalcitabine]); alcohol; vitamin deficiencies such as vitamin B12; and monoclonal gammopathies. Up to 27% of adults with neuropathy have no identifiable etiology for their neuropathy after diagnostic testing. Recommended initial testing includes blood glucose (for diabetes), serum B12 with metabolites (methylmalonic acid with or without homocysteine), and serum protein electrophoresis with immunofixation (for monoclonal gammopathies). First-line medications for neuropathic pain are the α2-δ calcium channel subunit ligands, such as gabapentin and pregabalin; serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, such as duloxetine and venlafaxine; and tricyclic antidepressants, such as amitryptyline and nortriptyline. Pain often persists despite medical management. At least a 50% reduction in pain was observed in 38% of those with painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy receiving 1200 mg of gabapentin daily. Combination drug therapies for neuropathic pain may provide added benefit. The prognosis of peripheral neuropathy depends on its underlying cause, but complete reversal of nerve damage is uncommon even in cases for which there are available treatments.

Conclusions and Relevance

Peripheral neuropathy affects approximately 1% of adults worldwide and may cause sensory, motor, and autonomic symptoms. Diabetes is the most common cause of peripheral neuropathy in Western countries. First-line therapies for neuropathic pain include gabapentin, pregabalin, duloxetine, and amitriptyline.

### Variants in mitochondrial disease genes are common causes of inherited peripheral neuropathies [^112SxNaT]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Inherited peripheral neuropathies or Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) is a group of closely related disorders affecting the motor and sensory neurones of the peripheral nervous system. With an estimated prevalence of 40 individuals per 100,000, CMT is among the most common hereditary neuromuscular disorders. CMT is categorised into demyelinating and axonal subtypes, based on the primary mechanism of degeneration.

CMT typically presents in the first or second decade of life, but the age of onset can vary widely, ranging from early infancy to late adulthood. Typical symptoms include symmetrical distal weakness and atrophy, sensory loss, foot deformities (pes cavus or planus, hammer toes, and clawing fingers), and reduced or absent tendon reflexes. Sensorineural hearing loss and phrenic nerve mediated respiratory insufficiency have also been reported. For the vast majority of patients, these symptoms are painless and, although progressively debilitating, not life threatening.

CMT exhibits significant genetic heterogeneity, with over 100 causative genes identified to date, and can be inherited through several different modes of inheritance, including autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, X-linked, and mitochondrial. These genes encompass a wide range of functions, including those involved in peripheral nerve structure, myelin production, axonal transport, and mitochondrial dynamics. This genetic diversity contributes to the significant phenotypic variability observed in CMT, with variations in age of onset, disease progression, severity of symptoms, and specific clinical features. Understanding the underlying genetic subtypes and their associated phenotypic variations is crucial for accurate diagnosis, prognosis, and personalised management strategies. Clinical diagnosis is complex and often elusive, focusing on clinical presentation, neurophysiological tests, genetic and molecular tests, and previously on nerve biopsy. The introduction of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology has significantly advanced the genetic diagnosis of inherited rare diseases in recent years. Despite this, in approximately 40% of all CMT cases a genetic diagnosis is not identified.

### Myoclonic seizures in a patient with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease [^112GoNBf]. Pediatric Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease affects both motor and sensory peripheral nerves, with broad variability in its clinical and pathologic expression. The involvement of the central nervous system in this disease has been reported in the past, and on two occasions Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease was associated with myoclonic seizures. The previously reported patients with associated Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and seizures developed a severe disease and died at a young age. This report describes a now 8-year-old male with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A associated with myoclonic seizures and developmental delay. Genetic studies established for the first time the duplication of the PMP-22 gene in a patient with this unusual association, confirming the diagnosis. The patient was treated with carbamazepine, valproate, and lamotrigine, has been seizure-free for over 2 years, and was successfully weaned from his medications.

### Controversies in the management of active Charcot neuroarthropathy [^112azc6K]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This article has shown the uncertainty about the pathogenesis, and true epidemiology of CN has still not been resolved. There is a lack of evidence on the sensitivity, specificity, cost-effectiveness, safety and patient acceptability of techniques used to diagnosis and monitor CN. There is a need to understand the different approaches to monitoring and treatment and identify whether and how these may contribute to the reported variation in time to healing, complications, and relapse rates. Finally, this indicates the need for an internationally coordinated approach to research in CN.

### Coexistence of two chronic neuropathies in a young child: Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy [^111P67Xo]. Muscle & Nerve (2010). Low credibility.

We report an 18-month-old Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1A (CMT1A) patient who developed a rapid-onset neuropathy, with proximal and distal weakness, and non-uniform nerve conduction studies. The neuropathy responded well to immunomodulation, confirming the coexistence of an inherited and an inflammatory neuropathy. Unexpected clinical and/or electrophysiological manifestations in CMT1A patients should alert clinicians to concomitant inflammatory neuropathy. In addition, this association raises reflections about disease mechanism in CMT1A.

### Myelin is dependent on the Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 4H disease culprit protein FRABIN / FGD4 in schwann cells [^113BPafV]. Brain (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease, also known as hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy, is one of the most common inherited neurological disorders. Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease is a clinically and genetically heterogenous disease, usually characterized by distal muscle weakness and atrophy, distal sensory loss and limb deformities. Clinically, Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease is divided based on electrophysiological and histopathological characteristics into demyelinating or dysmyelinating (CMT1, CMT3 and CMT4) and axonal forms (CMT2). The demyelinating or dysmyelinating neuropathies are commonly assumed to start with damage to Schwann cells and are mainly associated with reduced nerve conduction velocity. However, as demyelinating Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease progresses and axonal degeneration becomes an additional pathological feature, reduced amplitudes and dispersion of compound muscle action potentials become the main correlate to clinical disability. Axonal forms of Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease are thought to originate on the neuronal side and are linked to decreased compound muscle action potential amplitudes. The distinction with regard to the initially affected cell type is blurred in intermediate forms of Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease. As was recently shown, neuron-specific ablation of the prion protein in mice may cause a demyelinating neuropathy. This observation reiterated that experimental proof is required to unambiguously determine the originally affected cell type(s) in peripheral neuropathies, as peripheral nerves are controlled by continuous reciprocal Schwann cell–neuron interactions. Such knowledge is critical to understand the underlying disease mechanisms in the different forms of Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease and provides a rational basis for potential treatment strategies.

### Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome… [^112mcMeG]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome is a group of genetically determined symmetric distal polyneuropathies. The CMT loci are known to map to chromosome 1, chromosome 17, the X chromosome, and two additional unknown autosomes. The most prevalent form is CMT1A, an autosomal dominant demyelinative disorder caused either by a tandem duplication in band p11. 2–12 of chromosome 17 with trisomic expression of the peripheral myelin protein-22 gene or, less frequently, by a missense mutation of PMP-22. Missense mutations in PMP-22 are also responsible for two forms of demyelinative polyneuropathy in mice, trembler and tremblerJ. Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by recurrent focal neuropathy. In all families thus far studied, patients with HNPP have been found to be monosomic for a segment of chromosome 17P 11. 2–12.

The duplication in CMT1A and deletion in HNPP map to the same region in 17p11. 2–12 and are both likely to be consequences of unequal crossing over during germ cell meiosis. Chance PF, Pleasure D. Charcot-Marie-Tooth Syndrome. Arch Neurol. 1993; 50: 1180–1184.

### Peripheral neuropathy in mitochondrial disorders [^111ckKvf]. The Lancet: Neurology (2013). Medium credibility.

Why is peripheral neuropathy common but mild in many mitochondrial disorders, and why is it, in some cases, the predominant or only manifestation? Although this question remains largely unanswered, recent advances in cellular and molecular biology have begun to clarify the importance of mitochondrial functioning and distribution in the peripheral nerve. Mutations in proteins involved in mitochondrial dynamics (ie, fusion and fission) frequently result in a Charcot-Marie-Tooth phenotype. Peripheral neuropathies with different phenotypic presentations occur in mitochondrial diseases associated with abnormalities in mitochondrial DNA replication and maintenance, or associated with defects in mitochondrial respiratory chain complex V. Our knowledge of mitochondrial disorders is rapidly growing as new nuclear genes are identified and new phenotypes described. Early diagnosis of mitochondrial disorders, essential to provide appropriate genetic counselling, has become crucial in a few treatable conditions. Recognising and diagnosing an underlying mitochondrial defect in patients presenting with peripheral neuropathy is therefore of paramount importance.

Background and aims: In chronic demyelinating polyneuropathies more attention is often paid to motor and sensory functions, and autonomic functions are usually overlooked. The aim of our study was to examine autonomic dysfunction in patients with different types of chronic demyelinating polyneuropathies, acquired and hereditary.

Methods: Following diagnoses were included: chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP, n = 98), polyneuropathy associated with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS‐PN, n = 51), Charcot‐Marie‐Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A, n = 51), hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP, n = 18) in comparison to healthy controls (HCs, n = 125), SCOPA‐AUT questionnaire was used, comprising questions related to the function of the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal and urinary systems, as well as thermoregulation and sexual functions.

Results: Mean SCOPA‐AUT score was 13.6 ± 11.1 in CIDP, 18.4 ± 8.4 in MGUS‐PN, 14.1 ± 9.5 in CMT1A, 11.7 ± 8.6 in HNPP versus 7.4 ± 7.3 in HCs. All patient groups, except for HNPP, differed in comparison to HCs (p < 0.01). Gastrointestinal, urinary and cardiovascular scores were worse in MGUS‐PN compared to HCs (3.3 ± 3.6 vs. 1.4 ± 1.7, 4.5 ± 3.0 vs. 2.3 ± 2.6 and 1.1 ± 1.4 vs. 0.5 ± 1.0, respectively, p < 0.05). Thermoregulation was worse in all patient groups compared to HCs (p < 0.05). Male sexual dysfunction was noticed in CIDP and MGUS‐PN, and female sexual dysfunction in CIDP, MGUS‐PN and CMT1A.

Conclusion: Among patients with chronic demyelinating polyneuropathies, autonomic dysfunction was most pronounced in patients with MGUS‐PN. Patients with HNPP presented the least autonomic impairment.

### Treadmill training in patients affected by Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy: results of a multicenter, prospective, randomized, single-blind, controlled study [^116Mju5j]. European Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Rehabilitation treatment produces an objective benefit in people with CMT disease, both proprioceptive and stretching exercise as well as treadmill training. Moreover, we recommend advising patients with CMT disease to undergo rehabilitation treatment to prevent secondary impairments, maintain articular range of movement, avoid pain and contractures, and maximize remaining abilities.

### Transient, recurrent, white matter lesions in X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease with novel connexin 32 mutation… [^114bKt3y]. JAMA Network (2003). Excellent credibility.

Subclinical central nervous system involvement, detected by, for example, delayed acoustic evoked potential and discrete pyramidal signs, has, however, been described and even used to distinguish CMTX from other hereditary demyelinating CMTs. 2, 3 We present a family with CMTX, presenting a novel mutation in the Cx32 gene and showing transient and reversible white matter lesions in magnetic resonance imaging concomitantly to variable and reversible CNS symptoms. Comments We present a family with a CMTX-type polyneuropathy also presenting transient CNS symptoms, carrying a novel mutation in the Cx32 gene. Clinical and electrophysiological examinations showed the typical picture of a slowly progressive demyelinating neuropathy related to Cx32 mutations. 3, 5 Remarkably, transient non–gadolinium-enhanced white matter abnormalities, correlating with transient clinical neurological deficits, were observed in this family. Table 2).

6–8 Furthermore, many reports document subclinical involvement of CNS in CMTX. 3, 9 Also, as Cx32 is expressed in oligodendrocytes, it is conceivable that certain Cx32 mutations might lead to white matter abnormalities and CNS symptoms. Different binding partners and different cellular localization in the CNS and peripheral nervous system may be the reason why usually the PNS is predominantly affected in CMTX. Certain Cx32 mutations, like the one described here, may however cause obvious CNS disease. As Cx32 knockout mice have a normal CNS, these Cx32 mutations leading to CNS symptoms may act transdominant negative on other connexins known to be expressed in oligodendrocytes such as Cx47 and Cx27. 10 The existence of such transdominant negative effects has been described in vitro. 11, 12.

In analogy to channelopathies, altered gating properties of connexons with mutated Cx32 could theoretically give rise to transient CNS symptoms. Situations of metabolic stress may further alter the function of gap junctions and cause transient symptoms. Whatever the exact pathomechanism turns out to be, it is important to remember that there are clinical examples, as well as a good theoretical background supporting the idea that the second most frequent hereditary demyelinating neuropathy can not only lead to subclinical CNS involvement, but can cause patent CNS disease.

Plant alkaloids — vinblastine and vincristine: additional information on toxicity timing and risk factors. Acute toxicities most commonly occur and usually improve or resolve prior to patients entering long-term follow-up, but neuropathy can persist after treatment and is typically not late in onset. Studies of adults treated during childhood support higher prevalence of deficits than previously appreciated. Risk considerations include patient and cancer/treatment factors, pre-morbid/co-morbid health conditions, and health behaviors that may increase risk, including combination with platinum chemotherapy, gemcitabine, taxanes, and pre-morbid/co-morbid medical conditions such as anorexia, severe weight loss, and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease.

### Frequency, entity and determinants of fatigue in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease [^114ckPRM]. European Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease (CMT) collects a heterogeneous group of hereditary peripheral neuropathies characterized by distal motor weakness and atrophy, variable distal sensory loss, foot deformities and decreased‐to‐absent deep tendon reflexes.

Fatigue is a common complaint in many neuromuscular disorders, although it is difficult to define because of its subjective nature. Definitions in clinical research include the following: an 'overwhelming and persistent feeling of tiredness and diminished ability to sustain voluntary mental and physical activities' and also a sensation of 'weakness, lethargy and lack of energy that interferes with daily activities'.

Perceived or experienced fatigue, usually investigated through self‐administered questionnaires, can be distinguished from performance fatigability, characterized by difficulty in maintaining a physical performance through time which is tested during physical tasks. Fatigue has a multidimensional character and is determined by many factors, including health perceived status and participation in daily activities. Central fatigue is related to neuropsychiatric conditions and to disorders directly involving the central nervous system, whereas 'peripheral fatigue' is related to neuromuscular unit disorders.

Several questionnaires have been developed and employed to assess perceived fatigue, namely, the Checklist Individual Strength (CIS) scale, the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory and the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS). The MFIS is one of the most commonly used and has been validated in many neurological disorders, including multiple sclerosis and Parkinson disease.

A few studies assessed experienced fatigue in CMT employing different questionnaires and found a remarkable proportion of patients reporting significant fatigue, ranging from 43.2% to 64%. Some researchers focused on performance fatigue by using physical measures (such as surface electromyography analysis and repeated strength measures with a dynamometer during sustained effort or electrical stimulation during rest and after muscle contraction).

Perceived fatigue was assessed by using the MFIS in a large series of patients with CMT recruited through the Italian CMT Registry, and its correlations with disease severity and clinical characteristics, general distress, somnolence, body weight and use of drugs were examined.

### A review of genetic counseling for Charcot Marie Tooth disease (CMT) [^113RGisL]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2013). Low credibility.

Charcot Marie Tooth disease (CMT) encompasses the inherited peripheral neuropathies. While four genes have been found to cause over 90% of genetically identifiable causes of CMT (PMP22, GJB1, MPZ, MFN2), at least 51 genes and loci have been found to cause CMT when mutated, creating difficulties for clinicians to find a genetic subtype for families. Here, the classic features of CMT as well as characteristic features of the most common subtypes of CMT are described, as well as methods for narrowing down the possible subtypes. Psychosocial concerns particular to the CMT population are identified. This is the most inclusive publication for CMT-specific genetic counseling.

### Hereditary motor and sensory neuropathies or Charcot-Marie-Tooth diseases: an update [^116wFGi9]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2014). Low credibility.

Hereditary motor and sensory neuropathies (HMSN) or Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) diseases are the most common degenerative disorders of the peripheral nervous system. However, the frequency of the different subtypes varies within distinct populations. Although more than seventy clinical and genetic forms are known to date, more than 80% of CMT patients in Western countries have genetic abnormalities associated with PMP22, MPZ, MFN2 and GJB1. Given the considerable genetic heterogeneity of CMT, we emphasize the interest of both clinical and pathological specific features such that focused genetic testing could be performed. In this regard, peripheral nerve lesions in GDAP1 mutations (AR CMT1A), such as mitochondrial abnormalities, have been newly demonstrated. Otherwise, while demyelinating autosomal recessive CMT used to be classified as CMT4 (A, B, C…), we propose a simplified classification such as AR CMT1 (A, B, C…), and AR CMT2 for axonal forms. Also, we stress that next generation sequencing techniques, now considered to be the most efficient methods of genetic testing in CMT, will be helpful in molecular diagnosis and research of new genes involved. Finally, while no effective therapy is known to date, ongoing new therapeutic trials such as PXT3003 (a low dose combination of the three already approved drugs baclofen, naltrexone, and D-sorbitol) give hopes for potential curative treatment.

### Split hand syndrome in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type X1 (CMTX1): a clinical, neurophysiological, and radiological study [^111RLvXN]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Subsequently, we assessed the specificity of SHS for CMTX1 among all CMTs in a broader cohort, taking advantage of the Italian CMT Registry.

Importantly, throughout all the study, we focused on the originally reported thenar‐hypothenar dissociation, to eventually assess whether CMTX1 behaves similarly to motor neuronopathies as far as hand atrophy pattern is concerned. This can potentially shed light on the role of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) in the genesis of SHS, and have important implications for CMT diagnosis (if SHS proves typical of CMTX1 among CMTs) and management.

### Quality of life in children with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease [^1154gFZt]. Journal of Child Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

The authors studied the health-related quality of life of children aged 5 to 18 years with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease of varying types and severity and compared it with the general pediatric population. To capture and compare the quality-of-life data across a broad range of ages, the Child Health Questionnaire was completed by parents of 127 children with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. Affected children exhibited lower physical, psychological, and social well-being than the general pediatric population, with subsequent worsening of many domains with age. The type of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease influenced some physical and behavioral quality-of-life domains, while gender, body size, and ethnicity did not. Parent characteristics had generally little impact on the reporting of their child's quality of life, although parents with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease reported higher bodily pain in their children than those without. Overall, quality of life is negatively affected by the presence and severity of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease in childhood.

### Characterization of genetically defined types of Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathies by using magnetic resonance neurography [^111pobcm]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2005). Low credibility.

Object

Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease is a collection of related genetic disorders affecting peripheral nerves with an incidence of one in every 2500 individuals. A diagnosis of CMT disease has classically relied on a medical history, examination, and measurement of nerve conduction velocities. Advancements in genetic testing and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging techniques may provide clinicians with a more precise diagnostic armamentarium. The authors investigated MR neurography as a possible method to characterize CMT subtypes.

Methods

The authors performed MR neurography to evaluate sciatic nerves in the mid-thigh area of seven patients with genetically defined subtypes of CMT, one patient with chronic inflammatory demylinating polyneuropathy, and one patient without neuropathy. The authors correlate their findings with normal nerve conduction velocities (NCVs) and present their results as a descriptive case series. Although MR neurography could not be used to distinguish subtypes of CMT disease on nerve area or fascicle number, it appears to characterize phenotypic features and disease progression noninvasively in patients with some subtypes.

Conclusions

In conjunction with NCV measurements, MR neurography may be useful in the diagnosis of CMT neuropathies and in monitoring disease progression.

### Controversies in the management of active Charcot neuroarthropathy [^115BHaBN]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Charcot neuroarthropathy (CN) was first described over 150 years ago. Despite this there remains uncertanity around the factors that contribute to its development, and progression. This article will discuss the current controversies around the pathogenesis, epidemiology, diagnosis, assessment and management of the condition. The exact pathogenesis of CN is not fully understood, and it is likely to be multifactorial, with perhaps currently unknown mechanisms contributing to its development. Further studies are needed to examine opportunities to help screen for and diagnose CN. As a result of many of these factors, the true prevalence of CN is still largely unknown. Almost all of the recommendations for the assessment and treatment of CN are based on low-quality level III and IV evidence. Despite recommendations to offer people with CN nonremovable devices, currently only 40–50% people are treated with this type of device. Evidence is also lacking about the optimal duration of treatment; reported outcomes range from 3 months to more than a year. The reason for this variation is not entirely clear. A lack of standardised definitions for diagnosis, remission and relapse, heterogeneity of populations, different management approaches, monitoring techniques with unknown diagnostic precision and variation in follow-up times prevent meaningful comparison of outcome data. If people can be better supported to manage the emotional and physical consequences of CN, then this could improve people's quality of life and well-being. Finally, we highlight the need for an internationally coordinated approach to research in CN.

### Treadmill training in patients affected by Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy: results of a multicenter, prospective, randomized, single-blind, controlled study [^115z6ZCm]. European Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Performances on Walk12 did not significantly change during follow‐up in both groups with no significant differences between the two groups of treatment on performances over time (P for interaction = 0.79) although a greater change was observed at T2 among patients with TreSPE.

With regard to the balance assessment based on the BBS, a significant difference was detected between the SPE and TreSPE groups. In fact, although at T1 both groups showed an improvement, at T2 patients in the TreSPE group seemed to maintain the improvement, whereas patients in the SPE group surprisingly worsened. Considering the whole cohort, at T1 there was a significant mean change from T0, whereas at T2 the mean change was 0.05. On the SPPB, whereas at T1 both groups increased their mean performance, only the TreSPE arm maintained its level at T2. No significant differences were found between the two groups over follow‐up (P for interaction test = 0.41). For the whole cohort, at T1 we found a significant mean change from T0, whereas at T2 a non‐significant mean change from T0 of 0.10 (SE, 0.24) was observed. Regarding strength assessment, we found that overall patients improved their foot plantar strength at T2, at the limit of statistical significance, without a significant difference between the two groups (P for interaction test = 0.57).

Health‐related quality of life measure: Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36

We did not observe any significant changes during follow‐up for either the entire population or each group, except for the physical activity parameter, where a decrease of scores was assessed after the conclusion of treatment (T2–T0; mean decrease, 8.1; SE, 3.5) (Table 3). For all subscales, no significant differences were noticed in the scores over time when comparing the two treatments.

### Progressive neuropathic (peroneal) muscular atrophy (charcot-marie-tooth disease) [^115ds5hQ]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

THERE seems to be a general feeling among neurologists that one is justified in considering as a disease entity the condition variously called "peroneal muscular atrophy of the Charcot-Marie-Tooth type, " "progressive neuritic muscular atrophy, " or "spinal neuritic form of progressive muscular atrophy". The weight of available evidence concerning its etiology, most recently reviewed by England and Denny-Brown, 1 is in favor of an affection of the spinal cord and of peripheral nerves being the primary process, the muscular changes being secondary; but few autopsy reports are found in the literature.

However, biopsy of affected muscles may give information of interest, since it is now well established that the histological changes in the muscles in progressive muscular dystrophies differ in certain respects from those occurring in diseases involving primarily the peripheral motor neurons, such as amytrophic lateral sclerosis, progressive spinal muscular atrophy, syringomyelia, and poliomyelitis. 2 Brodal and Refsum3 described.

### Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease subtypes and genetic testing strategies [^115oPT56]. Annals of Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) affects 1 in 2,500 people and is caused by mutations in more than 30 genes. Identifying the genetic cause of CMT is often necessary for family planning, natural history studies, and for entry into clinical trials. However genetic testing can be both expensive and confusing to patients and physicians.

Methods

We analyzed data from 1,024 of our patients to determine the percentage and features of each CMT subtype within this clinic population. We identified distinguishing clinical and physiological features of the subtypes that could be used to direct genetic testing for patients with CMT.

Results

Of 1,024 patients evaluated, 787 received CMT diagnoses. A total of 527 patients with CMT (67%) received a genetic subtype, while 260 did not have a mutation identified. The most common CMT subtypes were CMT1A, CMT1X, hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP), CMT1B, and CMT2A. All other subtypes accounted for less than 1% each. Eleven patients had > 1 genetically identified subtype of CMT. Patients with genetically identified CMT were separable into specific groups based on age of onset and the degree of slowing of motor nerve conduction velocities.

Interpretation

Combining features of the phenotypic and physiology groups allowed us to identify patients who were highly likely to have specific subtypes of CMT. Based on these results, we propose a strategy of focused genetic testing for CMT, illustrated in a series of flow diagrams created as testing guides.

### Diabetic foot disorders. A clinical practice guideline (2006 revision) [^116itCjQ]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2007). Medium credibility.

Diabetic Charcot foot (neuropathic osteoarthropathy) — definition and core pathogenesis emphasize progressive joint and bone destruction driven by neuropathy and trauma. Charcot foot is a progressive condition characterized by joint dislocation, pathologic fractures, and severe destruction of the pedal architecture, which can result in debilitating deformity or even amputation. The etiology is most likely a combination of neurovascular and neurotraumatic theories, with trauma superimposed on a severely neuropathic extremity the most widely accepted trigger for an acute Charcot foot. Associated autonomic neuropathy increases blood flow to the foot, resulting in osteopenia and attendant weakness of the bone; loss of protective sensation leaves the patient unaware, and a vicious cycle ensues as the patient continues to walk on the injured foot, allowing further damage.

### Mutations in MME cause an autosomal-recessive Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2 [^112rQecx]. Annals of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

In this study, we attempted to identify novel AR‐CMT disease‐causing genes using whole‐exome sequencing (WES) analyses in many patients with CMT with an overlap‐based strategy, which helps identify candidate genes by focusing on variants shared among multiple unrelated patients with the same phenotype.

We identified mutations in the membrane metalloendopeptidase (MME) gene in 10 unrelated patients with adult‐onset axonal neuropathy. The MME gene encodes neprilysin (NEP), which is termed cluster of differentiation 10 (CD10), and may play a role in degrading a variety of neuropeptides. NEP has been found not only in the central nervous system (CNS), but also the peripheral nervous system (PNS) in mammals. 6, 7 The role of NEP in PNS is unclear; however, it is well known that NEP is one of the most prominent β‐amyloid (Aβ)‐degrading enzymes in the CNS. 8 NEP is recognized to play an important protective role against Alzheimer's disease. 9, 10, 11 NEP‐deficient mice showed increased Aβ accumulation in the brain, which resulted in Alzheimer's disease–like pathology and behavioral abnormalities. 12, 13 However, it is not yet clear how loss‐of‐function mutations in MME affect the human phenotypes.

Here, we describe the clinical characteristics of patients with CMT with MME mutations, including whether or not they show evidence of Alzheimer's disease, and we provide genetic and histopathological data to support the contention that the recessive mutations in MME are responsible for CMT.

### AAV1.NT-3 gene therapy for Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy [^112hmTj8]. Molecular Therapy (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease (CMT) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of sensorimotor peripheral neuropathies and represents the most frequent inherited disorder(s) affecting the nervous system. In this study, we provide preclinical, proof of principle data demonstrating efficacy in a mouse model of the demyelinating form of CMT (CMT1), supporting an adenoassociated virus (AAV)-mediated neurotrophin 3 (NT-3) gene therapy clinical trial. There is no treatment for this condition with onset between 5 and 25 years, bilateral foot drop, symmetric atrophy of muscles below the knee, and weakness of hands. The use of ambulatory aids is common. CMT1 is the most common of all inherited neuropathies (prevalence 30/100,000), and the subtype of CMT1A with mutations of peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22) represents 70–80% of all CMTs. CMT1A is a primary Schwann cell (SC) disease resulting from 1.4 Mb duplication at chromosome 17p11.2 that encompasses PMP22.

### Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4C: novel mutations, clinical presentations, and diagnostic challenges [^113kAiG2]. Muscle & Nerve (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

This study analyzes and describes atypical presentations of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4C (CMT4C).

Methods

We present clinical and physiologic features of 5 patients with CMT4C caused by biallelic private mutations of SH3TC2.

Results

All patients manifested scoliosis, and nerve conduction study indicated results in the demyelinating range. All patients exhibited signs of motor impairment within the first years of life. We describe 2 or more different genetic diseases in the same patient, atypical presentations of CMT, and 3 new mutations in CMT4C patients.

Discussion

A new era of unbiased genetic testing has led to this small case series of individuals with CMT4C and highlights the recognition of different genetic diseases in CMT4C patients for accurate diagnosis, genetic risk identification, and therapeutic intervention. The phenotype of CMT4C, in addition, appears to be enriched by a number of features unusual for the broad CMT category. Muscle Nerve 57: 749–755, 2018.

### Mitochondrial defects and neuromuscular degeneration caused by altered expression of drosophila gdap1: implications for the Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy [^111zer6M]. Human Molecular Genetics (2015). Low credibility.

One of the genes involved in Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease, an inherited peripheral neuropathy, is GDAP1. In this work, we show that there is a true ortholog of this gene in Drosophila, which we have named Gdap1. By up- and down-regulation of Gdap1 in a tissue-specific manner, we show that altering its levels of expression produces changes in mitochondrial size, morphology and distribution, and neuronal and muscular degeneration. Interestingly, muscular degeneration is tissue-autonomous and not dependent on innervation. Metabolic analyses of our experimental genotypes suggest that alterations in oxidative stress are not a primary cause of the neuromuscular degeneration but a long-term consequence of the underlying mitochondrial dysfunction. Our results contribute to a better understanding of the role of mitochondria in CMT disease and pave the way to generate clinically relevant disease models to study the relationship between mitochondrial dynamics and peripheral neurodegeneration.

### Imbalance of NRG1-ERBB2 / 3 signalling underlies altered myelination in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease 4H [^111Nb1ti]. Brain (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Charcot–Marie–Tooth (CMT) disease, also known as hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy (HMSN), is one of the most common inherited group of neurological diseases, with an overall prevalence of about 1/2500. Clinically, CMT diseases are characterized by progressive muscular weakness starting at the distal extremities, pes cavus deformity, loss of deep tendon reflexes, associated with mild to moderate distal sensory loss. Two main subgroups can be defined based on electrophysiological and histopathological characteristics: the demyelinating form (CMT1) resulting from primary damage of myelinating Schwann cells (SCs) and the axonal form (CMT2), affecting the axons from motor (MNs) and/or sensory neurons (SNs). Patients affected with CMT1 have reduced nerve-conduction velocities (NCVs; ≤ 38 m/s), whereas patients affected with CMT2 show slightly reduced to normal NCVs but reduced amplitudes (≥ 38 m/s). In addition, CMT disease is characterized by extensive clinical and genetic heterogeneity, with around 100 genes identified to date and mutations segregating following all modes of inheritance.

### O-glcNAcylation regulates neurofilament-light assembly and function and is perturbed by Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease mutations [^113h9E3S]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Of the triplet proteins, NF-L is required for the structural integrity of axons –, has been detected at post-synaptic sites, and directly interacts with the N -methyl — aspartate receptor to influence high-order brain functions. Ablating the NEFL gene, which encodes NF-L, impairs the maturation of regenerating myelinated axons, dendritic arborization, and peripheral nerve regeneration in mice. Motor neurons derived from human NEFL −/ − induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) show reduced axonal caliber, dysregulated mitochondrial motility, and decreased electrophysiological activity. Moreover, NF-L assembly state and functions are perturbed in a range of nervous system disorders. NEFL mutations cause some subtypes of Charcot–Marie–Tooth (CMT) disease, an inherited peripheral neuropathy characterized by progressive atrophy of the distal limb muscles that leads to sensory loss and tendon reflex defects. CMT-causative mutations in NEFL or other genes result in NF aggregation and aberrant motility of neuronal mitochondria –, underlining the physiological importance of NF-L function. Aggregation of wild-type (WT) NF-L and other NF proteins is also a pathological hallmark of a variety of neurological conditions, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), giant axonal neuropathy (GAN), and spinal muscular atrophy. Recently, NF-L levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood have emerged as powerful biomarkers of neuronal injury and nervous system disorders, showing promise for early diagnosis in a variety of clinical settings –. Given this broad pathophysiological significance, elucidating the regulation of NF assembly state and functions is a key goal. However, the molecular mechanisms governing NFs remain incompletely understood.

### The central nervous system phenotype of X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease: a transient disorder of children and young adults [^112CXQWx]. Journal of Child Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

We describe 2 patients with X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, type 1 (CMTX1) disease and central nervous system manifestations and review 19 cases from the literature. Our first case had not been previously diagnosed with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, and the second case, although known to have Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, was suspected of having CMTX1 after presentation with central nervous system manifestations. The most common central nervous system manifestations were transient and included dysarthria, ataxia, hemiparesis, and tetraparesis resembling periodic paralysis. Of the 21 patients, 19 presented at 21 years of age or younger, implicating CMTX1 with transient central nervous system manifestations as a disorder that predominantly affects children and adolescents. CMTX1 should be included in the differential diagnosis of patients who present with transient central nervous system phenomena, including stroke-like episodes, tetraparesis suggestive of periodic paralysis, dysarthria, ataxia, or combinations of these deficits. Reversible, bilateral, nonenhancing white matter lesions and restricted diffusion on magnetic resonance imaging are characteristic features of the central nervous system phenotype of CMTX1.

### Daytime sleepiness and sleep quality in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease [^112Q3Ldy]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

On the other hand, we found no difference for age, disease duration, disease severity (as assessed by the CMTES), lower limb disability, BMI, use of antidepressants/anxiolytics, and anti-inflammatory/analgesic drugs consumption (Table 2). There was no difference in daytime sleepiness according to CMT type (median ESS score: CMT1A = 7 vs other CMT types = 7, p = 0.260).

We then examined the correlations between daytime sleepiness scores and disease severity (CMTES), general distress, fatigue, BMI, sleep quality (Supplementary Table 1), and diabetes presence (n = 10). We found a slight correlation between somnolence and anxiety/depression/general distress (HADS-A, HADS-D, HADS-T, r = 0.36, r = 0.32, r = 0.37, respectively), while a stronger correlation was found between somnolence and general/physical/cognitive fatigue (r = 0.40, r = 0.49, r = 0.49, respectively).

The median nerves of 24 patients with genetically proven Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (12 patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A, seven with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2, and five with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type X) were prospectively examined at the right mid forearm with a 12-5-MHz transducer. Image analysis for each patient included measurement of both the cross-sectional area and fascicular diameter of the nerve. Correlations then were made with genetic and electrophysiologic features and with findings in a control group of 50 subjects.

Results

Sonography was found to be a reliable means of detecting the nerve hypertrophy and the fascicular swelling occurring in patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. The 1A type of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease could be distinguished sonographically by a larger nerve area and fascicular diameter than those observed in patients with the other types of disease (including Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2 and X-linked type) and the control subjects. In patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and control subjects, linear regression analysis did not show a correlation between either the cross-sectional area or fascicular diameter of the nerve and the patient's height, body mass, sex, or electrophysiologic parameters.

Conclusion

High-resolution sonography can be used to detect the hypertrophy of median nerves in patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. It can be helpful in defining the Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1A on the basis of the larger nerve sizes and fascicular diameters than those occurring in patients with other types of the disease. In an affected kindred, sonography is promising as a screening tool for identifying individuals who should undergo genetic assessments.

### Mechanisms of disease: a molecular genetic update on hereditary axonal neuropathies [^111jpAP4]. Nature Clinical Practice: Neurology (2006). Medium credibility.

Hereditary axonal peripheral neuropathies comprise a genetically heterogeneous group of disorders that are clinically subsumed under the name of Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease type 2 (CMT2). Historically, two classes of CMT have been differentiated: demyelinating forms of CMT (CMT1), in which nerve conduction velocities are decreased, and the axonal CMT2 forms, in which nerve conduction velocities are preserved. Recently, a number of genes that are defective in patients with the main forms of CMT2 have been identified. The molecular dissection of cellular functions of the related gene products has only just begun, and detailed pathophysiological models are still lacking. The known CMT2-related genes represent key players in these pathways, however, and are likely to provide powerful tools for identifying targets for future therapeutic intervention.

### Deoxy-sphingolipids, oxidative stress, and vitamin C correlate with qualitative and quantitative patterns of small fiber dysfunction and degeneration [^115MrQpH]. Pain (2022). Medium credibility.

1. Introduction

Small fiber neuropathies (SFNs) comprise a symptom spectrum caused by dysfunction or degeneration of intraepidermal C and Aδ nerve fibers. Neuropathic pain, the leading manifestation of SFNs, is typically described as a burning, tingling, electrifying, pricking, or itching sensation on the surface of or closely underneath the skin. SFNs can also cause sensory deficits, including a reduced pinprick and temperature perception, as well as autonomic symptoms, such as reduced sweat production, dry eyes, orthostatic intolerance, gastrointestinal disturbances, incontinence, and erectile dysfunction. At the brink of being considered a rare disease, the prevalence of SFNs is estimated approximately 1 in 2000 inhabitants. The diagnosis is confirmed by the combination of (1) the characteristic clinical picture and patient history, (2) evidence of either small fiber dysfunction using quantitative sensory testing (QST) or of small fiber degeneration in the skin biopsy, and (3) the exclusion of a large fiber polyneuropathy by nerve conduction studies (NCSs). Despite and because of being difficult to objectify, SFNs have the potential to cause severe disability and a high psychological burden.

The causative spectrum of SFNs is heterogeneous ranging from inflammatory and metabolic to hereditary causes. Approximately half of all diagnosed SFNs remain idiopathic to date.

As a potential risk factor, oxidative stress has previously been identified to be a key player in diabetic, or autoimmuneneuropathies. The antioxidant vitamin C is critically involved in myelination processesand has therefore been discussed to mitigate disease severity in Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease type 1A; however, clinical trials eventually failed to show a significant benefit. In the context of small fiber neuropathies, inflammatory cytokines were shown to be significantly elevated in patient skin specimens, although specific serum marker constellations indicative for SFN subtypes have not been described so far. Higher serum levels of neurotoxic 1-deoxy-sphingolipids were shown in patients with diabetic neuropathies, and with hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy (HSAN) types 1A and C. In a small HSAN1A cohort, the oral substitution of L-serine was associated with an improvement of disease severity; long-term effects remain, however, to be studied in larger cohorts.

### Coexistent central and peripheral nervous system involvement in a Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome X-linked patient [^114P7j7X]. Journal of Child Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

A 14-year-old boy with an episode of acute weakness resembling acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis and polyradiculoneuritis after a febrile illness is described. Molecular analysis showed a mutation at codon 164 of the connexin 32 gene. Neuroradiological and neurophysiological follow-up is reported during acute and chronic phases of disease, suggesting that during metabolic stress connexin 32 mutations lead to a loss of normal cellular communication and reversible cell dysfunction in oligodendrocytes and in Schwann cells. These data confirm that altered gating properties of connexin 32 could give rise to acute, transient central and peripheral nervous system symptoms in situations of metabolic stress.

### Colony-stimulating factor-1 mediates macrophage-related neural damage in a model for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1X [^114j641W]. Brain (2012). Low credibility.

Previous studies in our laboratory have shown that in models for three distinct forms of the inherited and incurable nerve disorder, Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy, low-grade inflammation implicating phagocytosing macrophages mediates demyelination and perturbation of axons. In the present study, we focus on colony-stimulating factor-1, a cytokine implicated in macrophage differentiation, activation and proliferation and fostering neural damage in a model for Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy 1B. By crossbreeding a model for the X-linked form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy with osteopetrotic mice, a spontaneous null mutant for colony-stimulating factor-1, we demonstrate a robust and persistent amelioration of demyelination and axon perturbation. Furthermore, functionally important domains of the peripheral nervous system, such as juxtaparanodes and presynaptic terminals, were preserved in the absence of colony-stimulating factor-1-dependent macrophage activation. As opposed to other Schwann cell-derived cytokines, colony-stimulating factor-1 is expressed by endoneurial fibroblasts, as revealed by in situ hybridization, immunocytochemistry and detection of β-galactosidase expression driven by the colony-stimulating factor-1 promoter. By both light and electron microscopic studies, we detected extended cell-cell contacts between the colony-stimulating factor-1-expressing fibroblasts and endoneurial macrophages as a putative prerequisite for the effective and constant activation of macrophages by fibroblasts in the chronically diseased nerve. Interestingly, in human biopsies from patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1, we also found frequent cell-cell contacts between macrophages and endoneurial fibroblasts and identified the latter as main source for colony-stimulating factor-1. Therefore, our study provides strong evidence for a similarly pathogenic role of colony-stimulating factor-1 in genetically mediated demyelination in mice and Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1 disease in humans. Thus, colony-stimulating factor-1 or its cognate receptor are promising target molecules for treating the detrimental, low-grade inflammation of several inherited neuropathies in humans.

### Pain and small fiber function in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A [^112zTLpQ]. Muscle & Nerve (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease type 1A is the most common form of CMT. The main clinical features are distal weakness, sensory loss, and skeletal deformities. Although pain is a frequent complaint, small fiber involvement in CMT1A has not been studied extensively.

Methods

We assessed pain and small fiber involvement in 49 CMT1A patients using a variety of pain scales, pain questionnaires, and thermal thresholds.

Results

Forty-three of 49 patients (88%) complained of pain. The pain was localized to the feet in 61% of patients. Only 18% of patients had neuropathic pain. Cold and warm detection thresholds were elevated in 53% and 12% of patients, respectively.

Conclusions

Our findings confirm that CMT1A patients have significant pain, which is more likely to be multifactorial in origin and suggests that a proportion of patients have small fiber dysfunction affecting mainly thinly myelinated Aδ fibers.
