## Question

What are the main differences between tirzepatide and Wegovy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the main differences between tirzepatide and Wegovy (semaglutide). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about pharmacology and mechanism of action. Then, I should verify comparative efficacy from pivotal trials, including head-to-head data and indirect comparisons. Next, I will review dosing and titration schemes. After that, I need to assess safety, tolerability, and labeled precautions, and I should double-check any stated contraindications. Finally, I will consider regulatory indications, real-world effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, and synthesize a pragmatic clinical decision framework supported by the evidence base [^1131JNcQ] [^112gL1iv] [^112Zwtm3] [^112aMrJP].

> Let me first confirm mechanisms, because that often underpins efficacy differences. Tirzepatide is a dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor co-agonist ("twincretin"), while semaglutide in Wegovy is a selective GLP-1 receptor agonist; this dual incretin activation is hypothesized to confer synergistic effects on appetite and glycemic control beyond GLP-1 alone, and mechanistic and clinical summaries from SURPASS support this biological plausibility [^113qX3T8] [^115oh8ff].

> Next, I should review head-to-head weight-loss efficacy where available. Hold on, let me verify the latest direct comparison numbers: in SURMOUNT-5, adults with obesity without diabetes randomized to tirzepatide 10–15 mg achieved a mean 20.2% weight reduction at 72 weeks versus 13.7% with semaglutide 1.7–2.4 mg, an absolute difference of 6.5% that is both statistically and clinically significant, with greater odds of achieving ≥ 10% and ≥ 25% weight loss and larger waist reductions favoring tirzepatide [^1131JNcQ].

> I will now examine comparative data in type 2 diabetes, where semaglutide doses differ from Wegovy's weight-dose and where metabolic efficacy is crucial. In SURPASS-2, tirzepatide 15 mg reduced HbA1c more than semaglutide 1 mg and produced greater weight loss; estimated differences in HbA1c were up to −0.45% and in weight up to −5.5 kg favoring tirzepatide, confirming superiority across glycemic and weight endpoints in T2DM populations, though doses differ from obesity-specific regimens and should be interpreted accordingly [^112gL1iv] [^111RqRWN].

> Let me consider the broader semaglutide efficacy context to avoid over-extrapolation. STEP 1 established once-weekly semaglutide 2.4 mg plus lifestyle as producing about 14.9% mean weight loss at 68 weeks in adults without diabetes versus 2.4% with placebo; a 2024 meta-analysis similarly showed roughly 12% relative and 12 kg absolute reductions versus placebo over long follow-up, with increased GI adverse events, underscoring strong GLP-1 efficacy even outside head-to-head settings [^112Zwtm3] [^111hWRbR].

> Wait, I should double-check dosing and titration because tolerability and time to target matter clinically. Tirzepatide for obesity (Zepbound) is initiated at 2.5 mg weekly for 4 weeks, with 2.5 mg increments every 4 weeks to 5–15 mg maintenance, allowing individualized selection of 5, 10, or 15 mg based on response and tolerability; Wegovy is titrated from 0.25 mg weekly with stepwise increases every 4 weeks to a fixed 2.4 mg maintenance dose by week 16, as used in STEP 1, reflecting a narrower final dose but a similar gradual escalation strategy [^112aMrJP] [^1175P4sA] [^112Zwtm3].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about safety without aligning it to dose and titration. Both agents have predominantly gastrointestinal adverse events that are dose-dependent and often transient; structured, slower titration strategies with tirzepatide reduce early GI intolerance, and dose-escalation studies show that starting low and increasing in smaller steps mitigates nausea and vomiting while preserving efficacy, which is directly actionable in practice [^116NqAq7] [^111QJu6B] [^116cENcx].

> I need to ensure I frame safety signals accurately. Prior pancreatitis is often handled as a precaution rather than an absolute contraindication for incretin-based therapies; I initially said "contraindication", but wait, I should correct myself and emphasize that labels typically carry warnings and precautions regarding pancreatitis and related monitoring, rather than a categorical prohibition, so clinicians should individualize decisions and counsel on abdominal pain symptoms while following label guidance for tirzepatide and GLP-1 class agents [^112aMrJP] [^112Zwtm3]. But wait, what about neuropsychiatric concerns? The EClinicalMedicine analysis notes that controversy over semaglutide and suicidality underwent further review with no confirmed causal signal to date; nonetheless, I should confirm locally mandated monitoring and patient history screening rather than dismiss the topic outright [^115cMr6G].

> Let me first confirm labeled indications because regulatory context guides choice. Tirzepatide is approved for T2DM (Mounjaro) and chronic weight management (Zepbound) with the dosing schedule above; semaglutide 2.4 mg (Wegovy) is approved for chronic weight management in adults, and STEP 1 provides the dosing escalation used to reach the 2.4 mg maintenance dose alongside lifestyle, aligning trial design with clinical implementation [^112aMrJP] [^1175P4sA] [^112Zwtm3].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I previously implied that prior bariatric surgery and recent weight change > 5 kg were "not recommended" for therapy; I should double-check and clarify that these were trial exclusion criteria rather than formal treatment contraindications, as STEP 1 excluded large recent weight changes and SURMOUNT-5 excluded prior or planned surgical obesity treatment, which limits external validity but should not be misread as label-based prohibitions in routine care [^112Zwtm3] [^1131JNcQ].

> Next, I should review cost-effectiveness because value influences selection when efficacy is close. Multiple economic evaluations suggest that tirzepatide delivers greater weight loss at similar or lower cost per unit weight lost versus semaglutide, with estimates around 45–50% better cost per 1% weight loss and lower cost per responder at composite glycemic and weight targets in T2DM scenarios, though assumptions about dosing, duration, and payer prices must be verified locally [^114cJ9nQ] [^112hNEmA] [^117Wk8Wy].

> I will now examine real-world effectiveness, but hold on, I should verify persistence and adherence effects. Propensity-score matched cohorts show greater on-treatment weight loss with tirzepatide than semaglutide at 3, 6, and 12 months, with absolute differences widening over time and higher likelihoods of achieving 5%, 10%, and 15% thresholds; however, discontinuation is common in practice, and some cohorts suggest the differential narrows in patients with T2DM, reinforcing that outcomes depend on dose reach and persistence [^114FhGQ9] [^115XcaTA] [^114s2ZMg].

> Let me consider adherence dynamics carefully. Modeling studies suggest that once-weekly incretin therapies are relatively "forgiving", with substantial efficacy retained despite missing occasional doses, and alternative-dosing simulations for semaglutide propose that less frequent administration may retain a large fraction of weight-loss effect, but wait, I should emphasize these are modeling data rather than prospective clinical trials, so they inform counseling but do not replace labeled regimens [^1145TSkd] [^115p9CyA].

> Next, I should review durability and maintenance because relapse after discontinuation is common. In SURMOUNT-4, continuation of tirzepatide maintained and augmented prior weight loss, whereas switching to placebo led to regain, underscoring that ongoing pharmacotherapy is typically required for weight maintenance, a principle that applies across this class and should be discussed upfront with patients [^115JoLWw].

> Finally, I need to synthesize a clinical decision framework and confirm any uncertainties. Primary differentiator: tirzepatide generally produces greater weight loss than semaglutide at maximal doses in adults with obesity, particularly without diabetes, with an absolute advantage of about 5–7% in head-to-head and indirect comparisons; in T2DM, tirzepatide also provides larger HbA1c reductions than semaglutide at diabetes doses, though dose comparability to obesity regimens should be kept in mind and cardiovascular outcome data for tirzepatide are still maturing with SURPASS-CVOT underway [^1131JNcQ] [^111RqRWN] [^112Zwtm3] [^112shHhR].

> Putting this into practice, I would choose tirzepatide when maximizing weight reduction and glycemic improvement is the priority and individualized titration flexibility is desired, recognizing the need for careful GI management during escalation; I would consider semaglutide when a fixed-target GLP-1 regimen is preferred or if tirzepatide is unavailable or not tolerated, while counseling that both require gradual titration, ongoing therapy for maintenance, monitoring for GI effects and pancreatitis symptoms, and shared decision-making informed by cost, coverage, and patient preference [^112aMrJP] [^112Zwtm3] [^115JoLWw] [^114cJ9nQ].

Tirzepatide and Wegovy (semaglutide) differ in **mechanism of action** and **weight loss efficacy**. Tirzepatide is a **dual GIP/GLP-1 agonist** [^113qX3T8], while Wegovy is a **GLP-1 agonist** [^112Zwtm3]. Tirzepatide produces greater weight loss (−20.2% vs −13.7% at 72 weeks) [^1131JNcQ] and superior glycemic control [^112gL1iv], but both have similar gastrointestinal side effects and once-weekly dosing. Tirzepatide is approved for obesity and type 2 diabetes, whereas Wegovy is approved for obesity only.

---

## Mechanism of action

Tirzepatide is a **dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonist** [^113qX3T8] that enhances insulin secretion, reduces glucagon, slows gastric emptying, and suppresses appetite. Wegovy (semaglutide) is a **GLP-1 receptor agonist** [^112Zwtm3] with similar downstream effects but acts solely at the GLP-1 receptor.

---

## Clinical efficacy

### Weight loss

Tirzepatide produces **greater weight loss** than semaglutide; in SURMOUNT-5 [^1131JNcQ], reductions were −20.2% vs −13.7% at 72 weeks (mean difference −6.5%, 95% CI −8.1 to −4.9). Wegovy (semaglutide) reduced weight by −14.9% vs −2.4% with placebo at 68 weeks in STEP 1 [^112Zwtm3] [^111hWRbR].

---

### Glycemic control

Tirzepatide provided **superior HbA1c reduction** versus semaglutide in SURPASS-2 [^112gL1iv] (−2.01% vs −1.86% at 40 weeks), whereas semaglutide provides effective but slightly smaller reductions [^112gL1iv] [^111RqRWN].

---

## Safety and tolerability

- **Gastrointestinal side effects**: Both cause nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea; tirzepatide may have slightly higher rates, especially at higher doses.
- **Hypoglycemia**: Low risk for both, higher when combined with insulin or sulfonylureas.
- **Other adverse events**: Both have low rates of serious adverse events; tirzepatide may have higher injection-site reactions.

---

## Dosing and administration

Tirzepatide is administered as a **once-weekly** subcutaneous injection, starting at 2.5 mg and titrating to 5–15 mg [^112aMrJP]. Wegovy (semaglutide) is likewise given **once weekly**, starting at 0.25 mg and titrating to 2.4 mg [^112Zwtm3].

---

## Regulatory approval and indications

Tirzepatide is **approved for obesity and type 2 diabetes**. Wegovy (semaglutide) is approved for **obesity only** [^112Zwtm3].

### Long-term efficacy and safety of once-weekly semaglutide for weight loss in patients without diabetes: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111hWRbR]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, has demonstrated clinically important weight loss effects in patients with type 2 diabetes. However, its effects on sustained weight loss in patients without diabetes remain unclear. Our objective was to examine the long-term efficacy and safety of semaglutide use for weight loss in patients with overweight/obesity and without diabetes.

MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Libraries were systematically searched to identify randomized controlled trials that randomized participants with overweight/obesity and without diabetes to once-weekly 2.4 mg subcutaneous semaglutide versus placebo, with a follow-up of at least 68 weeks. The primary outcome was a change in relative body weight from baseline to the longest follow-up. Random-effects models with inverse variance weighting were used to estimate the weighted mean differences (WMDs) and relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

A total of four randomized controlled trials (n = 3,087) were included. Of the three trials that provided body mass index by category (n = 2,783), 94.0% of the participants had a baseline body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m². Compared with placebo, the use of semaglutide was associated with substantial decreases in long-term relative (WMD -12.1%, 95% CI -13.5 to -10.7) and absolute body weight (WMD -12.3 kg, 95% CI -13.6 to -11.0). At the longest follow-up, 33.4% of participants randomized to semaglutide achieved ≥ 20% weight loss compared with 2.2% with placebo (RR 15.08, 95% CI 9.31 to 24.43). The risk of gastrointestinal adverse events was higher.

### Tirzepatide versus semaglutide once weekly in patients with type 2 diabetes [^111RqRWN]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Tirzepatide is a dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist that is under development for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. The efficacy and safety of once-weekly tirzepatide as compared with semaglutide, a selective GLP-1 receptor agonist, are unknown.

- **Methods**: In an open-label, 40-week, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned 1879 patients, in a 1:1:1:1 ratio, to receive tirzepatide at a dose of 5 mg, 10 mg, or 15 mg or semaglutide at a dose of 1 mg. At baseline, the mean glycated hemoglobin level was 8.28%, the mean age was 56.6 years, and the mean weight was 93.7 kg. The primary endpoint was the change in the glycated hemoglobin level from baseline to 40 weeks.

- **Results**: The estimated mean change from baseline in the glycated hemoglobin level was -2.01 percentage points, -2.24 percentage points, and -2.30 percentage points with 5 mg, 10 mg, and 15 mg of tirzepatide, respectively, and -1.86 percentage points with semaglutide. The estimated differences between the 5-mg, 10-mg, and 15-mg tirzepatide groups and the semaglutide group were -0.15 percentage points (95% confidence interval, -0.28 to -0.03; P = 0.02), -0.39 percentage points (95% CI, -0.51 to -0.26; P < 0.001), and -0.45 percentage points (95% CI, -0.57 to -0.32; P < 0.001), respectively. Tirzepatide at all doses was noninferior and superior to semaglutide. Reductions in body weight were greater with tirzepatide than with semaglutide (least-squares mean estimated treatment difference: -1.9 kg, -3.6 kg, and -5.5 kg, respectively; P < 0.001 for all comparisons).

### Tirzepatide, a dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor co-agonist for the treatment of type 2 diabetes with unmatched effectiveness regarding glycaemic control and body weight reduction [^113qX3T8]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2022). High credibility.

Tirzepatide is the first dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor co-agonist approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in the United States, Europe, and the UAE. Tirzepatide is an acylated peptide engineered to activate the GIP and GLP-1 receptors, key mediators of insulin secretion that are also expressed in regions of the brain that regulate food intake. Five clinical trials in type 2 diabetic subjects (SURPASS 1–5) have shown that tirzepatide at 5–15 mg per week reduces both HbA 1c (1.24 to 2.58%) and body weight (5.4–11.7 kg) by amounts unprecedented for a single agent. A sizable proportion of patients (23.0 to 62.4%) reached an HbA 1c of less than 7.0% compared to pooled comparators found in a meta-analysis covering the whole clinical trial spectrum.

### Tirzepatide versus semaglutide on weight loss in type 2 diabetes patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis of direct comparative studies [^116iDWeC]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) have emerged as an efficacious treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and have demonstrated substantial weight loss effects. This systematic review compares two prevalent GLP-1RAs, tirzepatide and semaglutide, with their weight loss effects and rates of adverse events (AEs).

Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), a systematic search was performed in PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library for direct comparative studies between tirzepatide and semaglutide. A meta-analysis was conducted via a random-effects model to analyze the differences in weight loss outcomes between study cohorts.

Four studies, with 28,827 patients (14,870 tirzepatide/13,928 semaglutide), mean age of 55.7 years (52.0 to 63.7), and mean follow-up of 35.9 weeks (23.6 to 44.6), were included in this study. Mean weight change across four studies for tirzepatide and semaglutide was −11.4% (−15.3% to −8.27%) and −7.3% (−8.3% to −6.08%), respectively. The meta-analysis supports these findings with a mean difference of −4.84 kg (95% CI: −6.21 to −3.47), favoring tirzepatide. The most common AEs were minor and moderate-severity gastrointestinal (GI) AEs.

Literature supports tirzepatide demonstrating a higher impact on weight loss than semaglutide, with both demonstrating high rates of minimal- to moderate-severity AEs. Further research with comparative head-to-head trials will better elucidate these weight loss effects and safety profiles.

### Tirzepatide versus semaglutide on weight loss in type 2 diabetes patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis of direct comparative studies [^1126DjKE]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Rodriguez et al. reported changes in body weight over 12 months between the 5 mg tirzepatide group (9193 patients) and the 0.5 mg semaglutide group (9192 patients). The authors used brand as a proxy for the target dose, although they recognized that patients in both groups may have received higher or lower doses than the standard doses. For proportions of weight loss such as body weight loss of > 5%, > 10%, and > 15%, tirzepatide had 81.8%, 62.1%, and 42.3% achieving these endpoints compared to 66.5%, 37.1%, and 18.1% for semaglutide. Hazard ratios comparing the tirzepatide with the semaglutide groups were 1.76, 2.54, and 3.24 for 5%, 10%, and 15% or more weight loss, respectively. It is important to note that patients with tirzepatide were younger, with a greater proportion that was female, White, and had a college education compared to semaglutide. However, the baseline weight was similar between groups.

In another study, Anson et al. evaluated weight loss at one year in patients without T2DM and found a significantly decreased body weight for tirzepatide at −7.7 kg (p < 0.001) and semaglutide at −4.8 kg (p < 0.001). It was noted that, due to the real-world nature of the data, accurate drug dosages that were prescribed or the number of doses each participant received was not able to be confirmed.

### Incidence of new onset type 2 diabetes in adults living with obesity treated with tirzepatide or semaglutide: Real world evidence from an international retrospective cohort study [^115cMr6G]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). High credibility.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA), by slowing gastric emptying and reducing appetite, are increasingly utilized pharmacotherapy in the treatment of overweight and obesity. The once-weekly preparation of GLP-1 RA, semaglutide, offers greater weight loss compared to the administration of earlier generation GLP-1 RAs such as exenatide.

Recently, tirzepatide, a dual agonist of GLP-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), has demonstrated a greater degree of weight loss compared to single peptide (GLP-1) receptor agonists. Weight loss is unequivocally the most effective intervention to reduce the subsequent risk of T2D in individuals living with overweight or obesity. In individuals who have already developed T2D, weight loss is associated with fewer adverse health events, lesser micro- and macrovascular complications, greater overall survival, and remission. However, the clinical effect of the newly introduced dual agonist, tirzepatide, on the incidence of T2D in individuals living with overweight and obesity, and indeed the impact on cardiovascular outcomes, remains unexplored.

Controversy surrounding semaglutide and the purported increased risk of suicidal thoughts, initially raised by the Icelandic Medicines Agency, has been subject to extensive review and has since been disproven. The risk of suicidal attempt and ideation has not been studied with tirzepatide use. Hence, in this study, we took advantage of a large international federated database of electronic health records to determine and compare the relative association of tirzepatide.

### Effect of weekly subcutaneous semaglutide vs daily liraglutide on body weight in adults with overweight or obesity without diabetes: The STEP 8 randomized clinical trial [^114nTXgk]. JAMA (2022). High credibility.

Phase 3 trials have not compared semaglutide and liraglutide, glucagon-like peptide-1 analogues available for weight management.

- **Objective**: To compare the efficacy and adverse event profiles of once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide, 2.4 mg, vs once-daily subcutaneous liraglutide, 3.0 mg (both with diet and physical activity), in people with overweight or obesity.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This was a randomized, open-label, 68-week, phase 3b trial conducted at 19 US sites from September 2019 (enrollment: September 11-November 26) to May 2021 (end of follow-up: May 11). The trial involved adults with a body mass index of 30 or greater or 27 or greater with one or more weight-related comorbidities, without diabetes (N = 338).

- **Interventions**: Participants were randomized (3:1:3:1) to receive once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide, 2.4 mg (16-week escalation; n = 126), or matching placebo, or once-daily subcutaneous liraglutide, 3.0 mg (4-week escalation; n = 127), or matching placebo, plus diet and physical activity. Participants unable to tolerate 2.4 mg of semaglutide could receive 1.7 mg; participants unable to tolerate 3.0 mg of liraglutide discontinued treatment and could restart the 4-week titration. Placebo groups were pooled (n = 85).

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary endpoint was percentage change in body weight, and confirmatory secondary endpoints were the achievement of 10% or more, 15% or more, and 20% or more weight loss, assessed for semaglutide vs liraglutide at week 68. Semaglutide vs liraglutide comparisons were open-label, with active treatment groups double-blinded against placebo.

### Semaglutide vs tirzepatide for weight loss in adults with overweight or obesity [^116q5872]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

- **Key points**: How does weight loss differ between patients receiving tirzepatide compared with semaglutide among a clinical population of adults with overweight or obesity?

- **Findings**: In this cohort study of 18,386 propensity-score matched patients initiating tirzepatide or semaglutide labeled for type 2 diabetes, discontinuation was common; most achieved weight loss of 5% or greater within 1 year of treatment.

- **Meaning**: Although most adults with overweight or obesity experienced 5% or greater weight loss with treatment, the benefit was greater with tirzepatide.

### The role of tirzepatide, dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist, in the management of type 2 diabetes: The SURPASS clinical trials [^112shHhR]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Low credibility.

Some SURPASS clinical trials include SGLT2 inhibitors as concomitant therapy, such as SURPASS-3 and -4. SGLT2 inhibitors have a favorable effect on weight and cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes. It would be interesting to examine the combined effect of tirzepatide and SGLT2 inhibitors on efficacy and CVD outcomes. Notably, the combined use of once-weekly exenatide and dapagliflozin resulted in superior HbA1c reduction and greater weight loss compared to the exenatide group and the dapagliflozin group. Therefore, one can argue that tirzepatide might not be solely responsible for favorable results.

None of the SURPASS trials are designed to compare tirzepatide against SGLT2 inhibitors. Further study comparing tirzepatide against SGLT2 inhibitors would be valuable in clinical decision-making. Since the 2008 publication of FDA guidance on anti-hyperglycaemic therapy, medications for diabetes should not only be efficacious in reducing HbA1c but should also have favorable cardiovascular outcomes, or at least no negative cardiovascular impact. The SURPASS-CVOT trial will provide long-term data on the cardiovascular safety as well as efficacy of tirzepatide.

### Cost per patient achieving treatment targets and number needed to treat with tirzepatide versus semaglutide 1 mg in patients with type 2 diabetes in the United States [^112hNEmA]. Diabetes Therapy (2023). High credibility.

The present analysis compared the clinical benefit and economic value of once-weekly tirzepatide (5 mg, 10 mg, and 15 mg) versus once-weekly semaglutide 1 mg among patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) who were inadequately controlled with metformin, had an HbA1c of 7.0–10.5%, and a BMI of at least 25 kg/m². The focus was on achieving glycemic control, weight loss, and composite treatment endpoints using outcomes data from the pivotal SURPASS-2 clinical trial.

The American Association of Clinical Endocrinology, ADA, and European Association for the Study of Diabetes have recognized that achieving HbA1c targets of ≤ 6.5 or ≥ 10% of baseline weight can potentially improve long-term outcomes. Thus, results for composite treatment endpoints with different thresholds for HbA1c reduction and ≥ 10% weight loss with no risk of hypoglycemia provide important insights relevant to the management of diabetes.

This analysis showed that despite having a higher annual pharmacy cost, the cost of achieving the triple composite endpoint of HbA1c ≤ 6.5%/ ≥ 10% weight loss/no hypoglycemia was 26%, 53%, and 60% lower for tirzepatide 5 mg, 10 mg, and 15 mg, respectively, compared with semaglutide 1 mg ($53,099). The results also revealed that tirzepatide had a lower cost per responder than semaglutide 1 mg for more stringent treatment goals of HbA1c and weight reduction. At a HbA1c goal of < 7.0%, the cost per responder was not statistically different between tirzepatide ($14,734 to…

### Continued treatment with tirzepatide for maintenance of weight reduction in adults with obesity: The SURMOUNT-4 randomized clinical trial [^115JoLWw]. JAMA (2024). High credibility.

The SURMOUNT-4 study, published in 2024 in JAMA, addresses obesity-related diseases. Researchers aimed to evaluate the effect of continued treatment with tirzepatide in adults with obesity or overweight. This multi-center, double-blinded randomized clinical trial involved 670 participants (473 females, 197 males). Inclusion criteria required adults with a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m² or ≥ 27 kg/m² and a weight-related complication. Exclusion criteria included a history of diabetes, prior or planned surgical treatment for obesity, and recent use (within 3 months prior to enrollment) of weight-loss medications.

- **Interventions**:
	- **Tirzepatide group (n = 335)**: Initiated treatment with 2.5 mg SC once weekly, increasing by 2.5 mg every 4 weeks to a maintenance dose of 10–15 mg once weekly, continued for 52 weeks following a 36-week lead-in period of receiving tirzepatide.
	- **Placebo group (n = 335)**: Received a matching placebo once weekly for 52 weeks following a 36-week lead-in period of receiving tirzepatide.

- **Outcomes**:
	- **Primary outcome**: A significant increase in mean weight reduction from week 36 to 88 (5.5% vs. -14%; ARD 19.4, 95% CI 17.7 to 21.2).
	- **Secondary outcomes**: A significant reduction in body weight (4.7 kg vs. -11.1 kg; AD 15.8 kg, 95% CI 14.3 to 17.3) and a significant reduction in waist circumference (4.3 cm vs. -7.8 cm; AD 12.1 cm) from week 36 to 88.

### Indirect comparative efficacy and safety of tirzepatide 10 and 15 mg versus semaglutide 2.4 mg for the management of obesity and overweight in patients with type 2 diabetes [^115ucEBj]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

The treatment regimen estimand and efficacy estimand ITCs arrived at similar conclusions regarding relative differences between tirzepatide and semaglutide. In terms of safety outcomes, tirzepatide was also associated with a generally similar safety profile to that of semaglutide, or better for tirzepatide 10 mg regarding total GI AEs.

While tirzepatide was associated with improved efficacy versus semaglutide, optimizing dose escalation is key to improving patient adherence. Balancing efficacy with tolerability and tailoring treatment to individual health profiles is essential for optimal outcomes.

This ITC is the first published evidence of the indirect comparative efficacy and safety of tirzepatide 10 and 15 mg versus semaglutide 2.4 mg in patients with both T2D and either obesity or overweight, which evaluated outcomes beyond weight reduction. The findings of this study in patients with both T2D and either obesity or overweight align with those from other direct and indirect comparisons of tirzepatide and semaglutide in other target populations or with other treatment doses. SURPASS-2 reported on patients with T2D receiving tirzepatide 5, 10, and 15 mg and semaglutide 1 mg. In a secondary endpoint of SURPASS-2, tirzepatide 10 and 15 mg showed statistically significant greater weight reduction versus semaglutide 1.0 mg (−3.6 and −5.5 kg, respectively). An ITC comparing tirzepatide 5, 10, and 15 mg to semaglutide 2 mg via semaglutide 1 mg for the treatment of T2D using SURPASS-2 and SUSTAIN FORTE also showed an association with statistically significant greater weight reduction.

### Efficacy and safety of tirzepatide, dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonists, in the management of type 2 diabetes: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^113k3ESu]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2023). High credibility.

Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and GLP-1 are the main incretin hormones responsible for the insulinotropic incretin effect. The addition of a GIP agonist to a GLP-1 agonist has been hypothesized to significantly enhance weight loss and glycemia control effects, potentially offering a new therapeutic option in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. This meta-analysis aims to synthesize evidence of primary efficacy and safety outcomes through randomized controlled trials to evaluate integrated potency and signaling properties.

- **Method**: We conducted comprehensive literature searches in Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Embase, and PubMed for relevant literature investigating the efficacy and/or safety of tirzepatide published in English, as of May 30, 2023. We synthesized results using standardized mean differences (SMDs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for continuous outcomes, and odds ratios (ORs) along with 95% CIs for dichotomous outcomes. All analyses were conducted using Revman version 5.3, STATA version 15.1, and the statistical package 'meta'.

- **Results**: Participants treated with weekly tirzepatide achieved HbA1c and body weight target values significantly lower than those of any other comparator, without a clinically significant increase in the incidence of hypoglycemic events, serious adverse events, or all-cause fatal adverse events. However, gastrointestinal adverse events and decreased appetite events were reported more frequently with tirzepatide treatment than with placebo/controls.

- **Conclusion**: Tirzepatide, a dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonist, demonstrates significant efficacy in managing type 2 diabetes, although it is associated with certain gastrointestinal adverse events.

### Tirzepatide 10 and 15 mg versus semaglutide 2.4 mg in people with obesity or overweight with type 2 diabetes: An indirect treatment comparison [^1121Rs8i]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

The aims of this study were to compare the efficacy of tirzepatide and semaglutide, which demonstrated clinically meaningful weight reduction in individuals with obesity or overweight and type 2 diabetes (T2D) in the SURMOUNT-2 and STEP 2 clinical trials, respectively. In the absence of head-to-head trials, the study focused on an indirect treatment comparison between tirzepatide 10 and 15mg and semaglutide 2.4mg.

- **Materials and methods**: Mean percent change in weight from baseline, weight reduction ≥ 5%, and mean change in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) were compared between tirzepatide 10/15mg (week 72, SURMOUNT-2) and semaglutide 2.4mg (week 68, STEP 2) using the Bucher method applied to the efficacy estimand. Sensitivity analyses included the use of matching-adjusted indirect comparison, treatment regimen estimand, and comparing study outcomes at 68 weeks.

- **Results**: Tirzepatide 10 and 15mg were associated with significantly greater mean percent weight reductions compared to semaglutide (mean difference, 10mg: 2.57%; 15mg: 4.79%, p < 0.01). Tirzepatide 15mg had significantly higher odds of achieving a ≥ 5% weight reduction (odds ratio 15mg: 1.76, 95% CI 1.04–2.97, p = 0.035; odds ratio 10mg: 1.24, 95% CI 0.75–2.04, p = 0.407). Both tirzepatide doses were associated with significantly greater reductions in HbA1c (%) levels (mean difference, 10mg: 0.47%; 15mg: 0.56%, p < 0.001) than^semaglutide. Sensitivity analyses were generally consistent with the primary analysis, except where power was reduced in the matching-adjusted indirect comparison analyses and in the categorical weight reduction outcome.

- **Conclusions**: This analysis supports the superior efficacy of tirzepatide over semaglutide in achieving weight reduction and improving HbA1c levels in the studied population.

### Efficacy and tolerability of tirzepatide, a dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist in patients with type 2 diabetes: A 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate different dose-escalation regimens [^111QJu6B]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

The number of patients experiencing combined adverse events (AEs) such as nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhoea was numerically greater in the tirzepatide 15 mg-1 treatment group (57.1%) compared to the 12 mg group (48.3%) and the 15 mg-2 group (46.4%). All tirzepatide treatment groups reported more nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhoea than placebo (11.5%). The severity of these events was mild to moderate in intensity, with none being severe.

Further evaluation of gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events incidence after the first dose (4 mg or 2.5 mg) indicated that lower starting doses could potentially reduce the incidence and prevalence of nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhoea. This is supported by comparing the incidence in the tirzepatide 4 mg dose (for the 12 mg group) with the 2.5 mg doses (for the 15 mg-1 and 15 mg-2 groups). Smaller subsequent dose escalations were also more likely associated with a lower incidence of these adverse events, as demonstrated when comparing 2.5 mg (15 mg-1 group) and 4 mg increments (12 mg group) with 5 mg (15 mg-1 and 15 mg-2 groups) or 7.5 mg (15 mg-2 group) increments.

### Real-world effectiveness of tirzepatide versus semaglutide for weight loss in overweight or obese patients in an ambulatory care setting [^114W88y2]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Obesity is a significant health burden as it is associated with comorbidities and an increased risk of mortality. Weight loss and chronic weight management can improve comorbidity risk, quality of life, and life expectancy, but patients often fail to achieve weight targets with lifestyle change alone. Thus, clinical guidelines recommend adding pharmacotherapy with proven weight loss properties to lifestyle modification for obesity, including GLP‐1 receptor agonists (GLP‐1RA) such as semaglutide, and the dual GLP‐1/GIP receptor agonist agent, tirzepatide. Randomized controlled trials have shown that semaglutide and tirzepatide have substantial potential for weight reduction, and results favor tirzepatide, but real‐world experience may not yield the same results. This study contributes real‐world insight into weight outcomes over 6 months of follow-up with tirzepatide versus semaglutide in obese and overweight patients.

### Tirzepatide for older adults with type 2 diabetes and without obesity: A post hoc analysis of the SURPASS clinical trials [^111okUBq]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). Low credibility.

- **Methods**: The SURPASS Clinical Trial Program study details, including concomitant medications and comparator treatments for the five SURPASS phase 3 registrational clinical trials included in this post hoc analysis, can be found at clinicaltrials.gov under NCT03954834 (SURPASS-1), NCT03987919 (SURPASS-2), NCT03882970 (SURPASS-3), NCT03730662 (SURPASS-4), NCT04039503 (SURPASS-5). Key eligibility criteria, as well as primary efficacy and safety results, have been published previously for all trials.

All trials were multicentered, randomized, parallel-group trials that compared the efficacy and safety of once-weekly tirzepatide 5, 10, and 15 mg versus placebo or active comparator in 6,263 adults with T2D. Efficacy endpoints were assessed at week 40 (SURPASS-1, -2, and -5) and 52 weeks (SURPASS-3 and -4). Sites provided diabetes care consistent with local standards of care. Trials were conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences International Ethical Guidelines, the International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practices Guideline, and other applicable laws and regulations. All protocols were approved by the appropriate local or central institutional review board. Participants provided written consent before undergoing any procedure.

The key inclusion criteria were reported with each individual study. Participants were at least 18 years of age and had T2D that was inadequately controlled while taking either no concomitant diabetes therapy or up to three oral antihyperglycemic medications or basal insulin.

### Tirzepatide versus semaglutide on weight loss in type 2 diabetes patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis of direct comparative studies [^111Pvxqz]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

The results from this study must be analyzed within the context of its limitations.

- **Paucity of trials**: First, there is a relative paucity in head-to-head trials comparing tirzepatide against semaglutide. Further studies, especially with longer-duration trials and varying dosages, can better elucidate the long-term weight loss reduction and maintenance and characterize the safety profile over time.

- **Inclusion of non-RCTs**: Second, two non-randomized controlled trials (non-RCTs) were included in this study, which may introduce bias that can affect the meta-analysis results.

- **Heterogeneity in studies**: Third, there was heterogeneity across the patient characteristics and the dose regimens in these studies.

- **Dosing discrepancies**: Fourth, the semaglutide dosage used across several studies is lower than the approved dose for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity, which may not fully reflect the results seen at clinically relevant doses.

### Efficacy and tolerability of tirzepatide, a dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist in patients with type 2 diabetes: A 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate different dose-escalation regimens [^116NqAq7]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). High credibility.

To assess the efficacy and tolerability of tirzepatide treatment using three different dose‐escalation regimens in patients with type 2 diabetes, a double‐blind, placebo‐controlled study was conducted. Patients were randomized (1:1:1:1) to receive either once‐weekly subcutaneous tirzepatide or placebo. The tirzepatide dose groups and dose‐escalation regimens were as follows: 12 mg (4 mg weeks 0–3; 8 mg weeks 4–7; 12 mg weeks 8–11), 15 mg-1 (2.5 mg weeks 0–1; 5 mg weeks 2–3; 10 mg weeks 4–7; 15 mg weeks 8–11), and 15 mg-2 (2.5 mg weeks 0–3; 7.5 mg weeks 4–7; 15 mg weeks 8–11). The primary objective was to compare tirzepatide with placebo in HbA1c change from baseline at 12 weeks.

Overall, 111 patients were randomized: placebo, 26; tirzepatide 12 mg, 29; tirzepatide 15 mg-1, 28; tirzepatide 15 mg-2, 28. The mean age was 57.4 years, HbA1c 8.4%, and body mass index 31.9 kg/m². At week 12, the absolute HbA1c change from baseline (SE) was greater in the tirzepatide treatment groups compared with placebo [placebo, +0.2% (0.21); 12 mg, −1.7% (0.19); 15 mg-1, −2.0% (0.20); 15 mg-2, −1.8% (0.19)]. The incidence of nausea was as follows: placebo, 7.7%; 12 mg group, 24.1%; 15 mg-1 group, 39.3%; 15 mg-2 group, 35.7%. Three patients discontinued the treatment because of adverse events, one from each of the placebo, 12 mg, and 15 mg-1 groups.

Tirzepatide treatment for 12 weeks resulted in clinically significant reductions in HbA1c. This suggests that lower starting doses and smaller dose increments are associated with a more favorable side effect profile.

### Real-world effectiveness of tirzepatide versus semaglutide for weight loss in overweight or obese patients in an ambulatory care setting [^114enbus]. Diabetes, obesity & metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

4 CONCLUSIONS

In this study of patients who were overweight or obese, tirzepatide was associated with greater weight loss over 6 months of follow‐up than semaglutide overall and in patients without diabetes. However, weight loss did not differ between the two agents in patients with diabetes.

The results of this real‐world study are generally consistent with clinical trials. This includes SURMOUNT‐1, which established the weight loss efficacy of tirzepatide over 72 weeks in obese patients without diabetes, and preliminary data from SURMOUNT‐5, a head‐to‐head trial comparing tirzepatide to semaglutide over 78 weeks in overweight/obesity patients without diabetes.SURPASS‐2, a study comparing tirzepatide to semaglutide in patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes, found greater weight loss with tirzepatide over 40 weeks of follow‐up than with semaglutide. However, the Real‐world study was of a shorter follow‐up time than SURPASS‐2, which may not have been sufficient to observe a significant weight loss difference between treatments in the diabetes cohort.

The Study is also consistent with a recent retrospective cohort study by Rodriquez et al. which observed greater weight loss with tirzepatide than with semaglutide in overweight/obese patients. The mean percentage change in body weight between tirzepatide and semaglutide in the Rodriquez study was similar to the findings of the Study. The Rodriquez study also suggested that those without diabetes experienced a larger reduction in weight loss than those with diabetes treated with either tirzepatide or

### Semaglutide vs tirzepatide for weight loss in adults with overweight or obesity [^112yhziK]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Although tirzepatide and semaglutide were shown to reduce weight in randomized clinical trials, data from head-to-head comparisons in populations with overweight or obesity are not yet available.

The objective of this study was to compare on-treatment weight loss and rates of gastrointestinal adverse events (AEs) among adults with overweight or obesity receiving tirzepatide or semaglutide, which are labeled for type 2 diabetes (T2D), in a clinical setting.

In this cohort study, adults with overweight or obesity receiving semaglutide or tirzepatide between May 2022 and September 2023 were identified using electronic health record (EHR) data linked to dispensing information from a collective of US health care systems. On-treatment weight outcomes through November 3, 2023, were assessed. Adults with overweight or obesity and regular care in the year before initiation, no prior glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist use, a prescription within 60 days prior to initiation, and an available baseline weight were identified. The analysis was completed on April 3, 2024.

- **Exposures**: Tirzepatide or semaglutide in formulations labeled for T2D, on or off label.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: On-treatment weight change in a propensity score-matched population was assessed as hazard of achieving 5% or greater, 10% or greater, and 15% or greater weight loss, and percentage change in weight at 3, 6, and 12 months. Hazards of gastrointestinal AEs were compared.

Among 41,222 adults meeting the study criteria (semaglutide, 32,029; tirzepatide, 9,193), the analysis was conducted.

### Tirzepatide versus semaglutide on weight loss in type 2 diabetes patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis of direct comparative studies [^116fTk3q]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

In the direct comparative studies analyzed in this meta-analysis, tirzepatide demonstrated superior weight loss compared to semaglutide, supporting the notion of enhanced clinical efficacy of dual GLP-1 and GIP agonism. The efficacy of semaglutide has been established throughout the SUSTAIN trials, where semaglutide showed significantly greater weight loss compared to placebo and active comparators (p < 0.0001 for all). Semaglutide also achieved greater proportions of weight loss over 5% or 10% (p < 0.0001 for all). Additionally, the STEP trials noted that semaglutide 2.4 mg had an average weight loss reduction of up to 16%.

Tirzepatide has also been established to be efficacious in reducing body weight, with up to 20.9% weight loss seen across the SURMOUNT trials. However, it is important to note that these trials evaluated each of these GLP-1 RAs independently rather than direct head-to-head trials. Thus, the data in this meta-analysis provide more clinically relevant comparisons between these agents.

Furthermore, the interaction between lifestyle intervention and usage of GLP-1 RAs is still unclear. However, Wadden et al. suggest that an initial lifestyle intervention period followed by medication addition can maximize weight reduction. This stems from the observation that STEP-1 (semaglutide only) and STEP-3 (lifestyle and semaglutide) did not produce an additive benefit towards weight loss. These findings in the literature combined with this study's results suggest that adding semaglutide or tirzepatide produces clinically significant weight loss that can be further p.

### Alternative dosing regimens of GLP-1 receptor agonists may reduce costs and maintain weight loss efficacy [^115p9CyA]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

The alternative dosing of semaglutide is an important consideration. Though dose sizes vary between patients, both semaglutide and tirzepatide are typically administered once per week (q1wk). Indeed, once-weekly is the dosing frequency studied in clinical trials, and phase 2 trials did not test dosing intervals longer than one week. We now use mathematical models to investigate the weight loss efficacy of alternative dosing regimens.

Semaglutide is commercially available in maintenance doses of 2.4 mg (recommended) and 1.7 mg, with 0.25, 0.5, and 1 mg available as escalation doses. Figure 2 predicts the efficacy of 1.7 or 2.4 mg of semaglutide administered less frequently than once-weekly. In Figure 2A, we plot the steady-state percent change in body weight as a function of the dosing interval (time between doses). The most salient feature of Figure 2A is that increasing the dosing interval (i.e. decreasing the dosing frequency) does not commensurately decrease the weight loss efficacy of semaglutide.

For instance, for a once-weekly (q1wk) dose of 2.4 mg, the model predicts a steady-state body weight reduction of 17%, which is in good agreement with clinical data for q1wk dosing. If the dose is fixed at 2.4 mg but the dosing interval is increased to 14 days (q2wk), the model predicts a steady-state body weight reduction of 12%. Therefore, despite the fact that decreasing the dosing frequency from q1wk to q2wk decreases the total amount of drug taken over time by one half, the model predicts that patients retain 72% of their weight loss compared with q1wk. Similarly, 1.7 mg q2wk retains 69% of the weight loss efficacy.

### Efficacy of tirzepatide 5, 10 and 15 mg versus semaglutide 2 mg in patients with type 2 diabetes: An adjusted indirect treatment comparison [^113qPUDr]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2022). High credibility.

To conduct an adjusted indirect treatment comparison (aITC) of the efficacy of tirzepatide 5/10/15 mg versus semaglutide 2 mg in patients with type 2 diabetes, the following methodology was employed:

- **Materials and methods**: The primary analysis was a Bucher aITC of the change from baseline at week 40 in HbA1c (%) and body weight (kg). Aggregate data from the SURPASS-2 study, which met the HbA1c inclusion criterion of the SUSTAIN FORTE study, and from SUSTAIN FORTE metformin-only treated patients were used for the primary analysis.

- **Results**: The SURPASS-2 refined population comprised 238/245/240 and 240 participants for tirzepatide 5/10/15 mg and semaglutide 1 mg, respectively. The SUSTAIN FORTE metformin-only population comprised 222 and 227 participants for semaglutide 1 and 2 mg, respectively. In this aITC, tirzepatide 10 and 15 mg significantly reduced HbA1c versus semaglutide 2 mg with an estimated treatment difference (ETD) of -0.36% (95% confidence interval [CI] -0.63, -0.09) and -0.4% (95% CI -0.67, -0.13), respectively. Tirzepatide 10 and 15 mg significantly reduced body weight versus semaglutide 2 mg with an ETD of -3.15 kg (95% CI -4.84, -1.46) and -5.15 kg (95% CI -6.85, -3.45), respectively. There were no significant differences between tirzepatide 5 mg and semaglutide 2 mg on change from baseline in HbA1c and body weight.

- **Conclusions**: In this aITC, HbA1c and weight reductions were significantly greater for tirzepatide 10 and 15 mg versus semaglutide 2 mg and were similar for tirzepatide 5 mg versus semaglutide 2 mg. These findings provide comparative effectiveness insights in the absence of a direct head-to-head comparison.

### Semaglutide vs tirzepatide for weight loss in adults with overweight or obesity [^114FhGQ9]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

The percentage change in body weight was assessed, showing a mean on-treatment change of −5.9% (95% CI, −6.0% to −5.8%) for tirzepatide, compared to −3.6% (95% CI, −3.7% to −3.4%) for semaglutide at 3 months, −10.1% (95% CI, −10.4% to −9.9%) vs. −5.8% (95% CI, −6.0% to −5.5%) at 6 months, and −15.3% (95% CI, −16.0% to −14.5%) vs. −8.3% (95% CI, −9% to −7.6%) at 12 months. After adjusting for residual confounding, the absolute difference in weight loss between tirzepatide and semaglutide was −2.4% (95% CI, −2.5% to −2.2%), −4.3% (95% CI, −4.7% to −4.0%), and −6.9% (95% CI, −7.9% to −5.8%) at 3, 6, and 12 months of receiving treatment, respectively.

Points represent point estimates, and whiskers represent 95% confidence intervals. Panels A-C show hazard ratios for achieving 5% or greater, 10% or greater, and 15% or greater weight loss for patients receiving tirzepatide vs. semaglutide among propensity score matched populations. Hazard ratios greater than 1 indicate a higher likelihood of reaching the weight loss threshold with tirzepatide. Panels D-F display absolute differences in body weight change at 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months for patients receiving tirzepatide vs. semaglutide among propensity score matched populations still receiving treatment at the time point. Negative differences indicate greater weight loss with tirzepatide.

### Real-world effectiveness of tirzepatide versus semaglutide for weight loss in overweight or obese patients in an ambulatory care setting [^115XcaTA]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

In the subgroup of patients without diabetes (n = 416), patients prescribed tirzepatide experienced a larger loss in body weight compared with those prescribed semaglutide (7.0% vs. 3.4%, p < 0.001). In the population with diabetes (n = 529), the percentage of weight loss was not statistically different between the tirzepatide and semaglutide groups (−3.3% vs. −2.2%, p = 0.30).

### Efficacy and tolerability of tirzepatide, a dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist in patients with type 2 diabetes: A 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate different dose-escalation regimens [^116cENcx]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). High credibility.

- **Safety and tolerability**: No deaths occurred during the study. One patient from the tirzepatide 12 mg treatment group reported two serious adverse events (SAEs): diarrhea and high white blood cell count. No patient discontinued the study because of gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events (AEs). There were two patients from the tirzepatide treatment groups (12 mg and 15 mg‐1) who discontinued the study drug because of a GI‐related AE of diarrhea.

There was a higher incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in the tirzepatide treatment groups compared with placebo, mainly because of a higher incidence of GI AEs in the tirzepatide treatment groups. The most frequently reported TEAEs overall were diarrhea (27.0%), nausea (27.0%), decreased appetite (16.2%), vomiting (14.4%), and headache (13.5%). The incidence of events was similar in each of the tirzepatide treatment groups with the exception of lower rates of nausea in the tirzepatide 12 mg group. The percentages of patients who reported nausea were: placebo, 7.7%; 12 mg group, 24.1%; 15 mg‐1 group, 39.3%; and 15 mg‐2 group, 35.7%. Graphs showing the prevalence and severity of nausea over time for each treatment group are provided in the supporting material (Figure S2).

### Tirzepatide versus semaglutide for weight loss in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: A value for money analysis [^114cJ9nQ]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

Higher doses of the glucagon-like peptide-1 agonist semaglutide, and more recently tirzepatide, a dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and glucagon-like peptide-1 agonist, have shown a significant reduction in body weight in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, their comparative value for money for this indication is unclear. Therefore, we aimed to establish which provides better value for money.

We calculated the cost needed to treat to achieve a 1% reduction in body weight using high-dose tirzepatide (15 mg) versus semaglutide (2.4 mg). The body weight reductions were extracted from published results of the SURMOUNT-1 and STEP 1 trials, respectively. In addition, we performed a scenario analysis to mitigate the primary differences between the two study populations. Drug costs were based on US GoodRx prices as of October 2022.

Using tirzepatide resulted in a weight loss of 17.8% (95% CI: 16.3%-19.3%) compared with 12.4% (95% CI: 11.5%-13.4%) for semaglutide. The total cost of 72 weeks of tirzepatide was estimated at $17,527 compared with $22,878 for 68 weeks of semaglutide. Accordingly, the cost needed to treat per 1% of body weight reduction with tirzepatide is estimated at $985 (95% CI: $908-$1075) compared with $1845 (95% CI: $1707-$1989) with semaglutide. Scenario analysis confirmed these findings.

Tirzepatide provides better value for money than semaglutide for weight reduction.

### Comparison of dose escalation versus switching to tirzepatide among people with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on lower doses of dulaglutide: A randomized clinical trial [^111Ak6Cu]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Tirzepatide, a once-weekly glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist approved for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes or obesity, showed clinically meaningful reductions in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and body weight in the SURPASS phase 3 clinical trial program.

- **Objective**: To compare the efficacy and safety of escalation of dulaglutide dose versus switching to tirzepatide in inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes.

- **Design**: Multicenter, randomized, open-label, phase 4 trial (SURPASS-SWITCH [A Phase 4, Randomized, Open-Label, Active-Controlled Study to Investigate the Efficacy and Safety of Switching from Weekly Dulaglutide to Weekly Tirzepatide in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes], ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT05564039).

- **Setting**: 38 sites across 5 countries.

- **Participants**: Adults with HbA1c 7.0% or greater to 9.5% or less, stable body weight, body mass index of 25 kg/m² or greater, receiving a stable dose of dulaglutide (0.75 or 1.5 mg) for at least 6 months, and 0 to 3 oral antihyperglycemic medications for at least 3 months.

- **Intervention**: Escalation of dulaglutide to 4.5 mg or maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or switching to tirzepatide.

- **Measurements**: The primary endpoint was change from baseline in HbA1c at week 40. The key secondary endpoint was change from baseline in weight at week 40.

- **Results**: A total of 282 adults were randomly assigned to tirzepatide (n = 139) or dulaglutide (n = 143). Change from baseline in HbA1c at week 40 was -1.44% (SE, 0.07) with tirzepatide, 15 mg or MTD, and -0.67% (SE, 0.08) with dulaglutide.

### Efficacy and tolerability of tirzepatide, a dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist in patients with type 2 diabetes: A 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate different dose-escalation regimens [^116h1f9d]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). High credibility.

This study, as well as the previously published phase 2b study, supports that dual agonism may have the potential to significantly affect the type 2 diabetes and obesity pandemic. The efficacy data in this study showed results consistent with the primary phase 2b study, with comparable reductions in HbA1c and weight loss at the 12-week time point. This consistency is reassuring and increases the probability that similar results may be observed in the phase 3 studies.

- **Key to the phase 3 development plan**: To determine the optimal dose to balance benefit against potential gastrointestinal (GI) side effects by choosing a dose-escalation regimen that minimizes side effects and maximizes efficacy. Although the 5 and 10 mg doses of tirzepatide previously showed a comparable GI side effect profile with dulaglutide in the phase 2b study, despite no or a short 2-week dose escalation, there were high rates of treatment discontinuation because of adverse events (AEs) in the 15 mg dose group. More patients in this group reported GI AEs compared to other groups. This dose-escalation study revealed that a numerical reduction of GI side effects compared to the 15 mg group of the phase 2b study could be achieved in all dose-escalation regimens by starting at a lower dose and prolonging the dose-escalation period to 8 weeks. This resulted in treatment discontinuation rates in all tirzepatide treatment groups that were similar or better than placebo. The rate of discontinuations because of AEs was very low, with only a few moderate and no severe GI AEs reported.

### Tirzepatide 10 and 15 mg versus semaglutide 2.4 mg in people with obesity or overweight with type 2 diabetes: An indirect treatment comparison [^1127wfb2]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

This indirect treatment comparison utilized data from the 72-week SURMOUNT-2 trial and the 68-week STEP 2 trial in individuals with obesity or overweight conditions alongside type 2 diabetes (T2D). In the absence of direct comparative trials between tirzepatide and semaglutide for this demographic, the analysis offers indirect evidence suggesting that tirzepatide treatment (10 and 15 mg) may have been associated with greater weight and HbA1c reduction than semaglutide (2.4 mg). These findings align with the recent topline results from the SURMOUNT-5 study in individuals without T2D and provide clinically relevant information for healthcare professionals and decision-makers concerning pharmacotherapy use to enhance care delivery and meet weight reduction and HbA1c control goals in individuals with obesity or overweight conditions and T2D.

Our findings are consistent with a previous indirect treatment comparison (SURMOUNT-1 vs. STEP 1), which showed a 5.9% greater weight reduction for tirzepatide 15 mg compared to semaglutide 2.4 mg in people with overweight or obesity without T2D and with the topline results of a head-to-head trial of tirzepatide versus semaglutide in this population (SURMOUNT-5, NCT05822830). This trial demonstrated that 72 weeks of tirzepatide treatment (10 or 15 mg) resulted in greater weight reduction compared to semaglutide (1.7 or 2.4 mg; mean weight reduction: 20.2% for tirzepatide, 13.7% for semaglutide). Inclusion of people with T2D in the analysis likely explains the lower weight reduction difference observed.

### Tirzepatide versus semaglutide on weight loss in type 2 diabetes patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis of direct comparative studies [^115XU7iC]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

Obesity is closely related to the lifetime risk for the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in men, with the risk increasing from 7% to 70% as the body mass index (BMI) rises from less than 18.5 kg/m² to greater than 35 kg/m². Similarly, the lifetime risk increases in females from 12% to 74% with the aforementioned BMI values. An estimated majority (approximately 86%) of T2DM patients are also overweight or obese. Notably, weight loss of 5%–10% has been shown to improve glycaemic control and decrease the incidence of diabetes by over 50%. At a 7-year follow-up, bariatric surgery elicited an 18.2% diabetes remission rate compared to the medical/lifestyle group at 6.2% (p = 0.02). However, bariatric surgery is considered a last resort if lifestyle modifications or medical therapies fail.

GLP-1 receptor agonists (RAs) such as liraglutide, semaglutide, and tirzepatide have been approved to treat obesity, providing these effects via increased insulin release, increased insulin sensitivity, decreased gastric emptying, and acting on central receptors in the central nervous system (CNS) to reduce appetite. The effects of GLP-1 RAs extend beyond T2DM and obesity, also reducing the risk of various systemic conditions. Nassar et al. conducted a retrospective cohort study with data spanning more than a 5-year follow-up period on patients with T2DM or obesity. The study found that GLP-1 RA treatment significantly lowered incidences of dementia (risk difference (RD): −0.010), Alzheimer's disease (RD: −0.003), Parkinson's disease (RD: −0.002), pancreatic cancer (RD: −0.003), systemic lupus erythematosus (RD: −0.001), and systemic sclerosis (RD: −0.000) with p < 0.001.

### Efficacy of tirzepatide 5, 10 and 15 mg versus semaglutide 2 mg in patients with type 2 diabetes: An adjusted indirect treatment comparison [^112ySjDK]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

The first limitation of this analysis is that only two studies were available for the adjusted indirect treatment comparison (aITC). Second, no baseline characteristics were available in the SUSTAIN FORTE metformin-only population. Therefore, baseline characteristics were compared between patients on metformin in SURPASS-2 and patients on metformin with or without a sulphonylurea in SUSTAIN FORTE.

This comparison also impacted sensitivity analysis 4, which adjusted for baseline HbA1c and body weight in patients on metformin in SURPASS-2 and patients on metformin with or without a sulphonylurea in SUSTAIN FORTE.

Third, in an attempt to compare patients receiving the same background antihyperglycaemic medication in both trials, only endpoints with data available in the SUSTAIN FORTE metformin-only population (change from baseline in HbA1c and body weight) were included in the aITC. Other glycaemic efficacy endpoints, such as the percentage of patients reaching an HbA1c target of < 7%, were not included in the analysis, as these were only reported for the full population of SUSTAIN FORTE (patients on metformin with or without a sulphonylurea) and not the SUSTAIN FORTE metformin-only population. For the same reason as above, no quantitative comparison for safety outcomes was performed.

In both treatments, the incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events was higher during the dose-escalation period and decreased over time. Fourth, it was not possible to compare the results of the treatment-regimen estimand in the SURPASS-2 refined population and SUSTAIN FORTE metformin-only population, as these results were not published.

### Tirzepatide, a dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor co-agonist for the treatment of type 2 diabetes with unmatched effectiveness regarding glycaemic control and body weight reduction [^115oh8ff]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2022). High credibility.

Tirzepatide is the first dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor co-agonist approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in the United States, Europe, and the UAE. Tirzepatide is an acylated peptide engineered to activate the GIP and GLP-1 receptors, which are key mediators of insulin secretion and are also expressed in regions of the brain that regulate food intake.

Five clinical trials in type 2 diabetic subjects (SURPASS 1–5) have shown that tirzepatide, administered at 5–15 mg per week, reduces both HbA1c (1.24 to 2.58%) and body weight (5.4–11.7 kg) by amounts unprecedented for a single agent. A sizable proportion of patients (23.0 to 62.4%) achieved an HbA1c reduction of 1.0% compared to pooled comparators found in a meta-analysis covering the entire clinical trial series.

### Indirect comparative efficacy and safety of tirzepatide 10 and 15 mg versus semaglutide 2.4 mg for the management of obesity and overweight in patients with type 2 diabetes [^115AdSrT]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

This indirect treatment comparison (ITC) analyzed the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide compared to semaglutide for managing obesity or overweight in participants with type 2 diabetes (T2D). The comparison was informed by the pivotal trials SURMOUNT‐2 and STEP 2.

Participants in the study had a body mass index (BMI) of ≥ 27 kg/m² and at least one unsuccessful prior dietary weight reduction attempt. They also had glycated haemoglobin levels of 7%–10% while on stable therapy. A heterogeneity assessment confirmed similar study and baseline characteristics across groups. The Bucher method compared tirzepatide 10 and 15 mg once weekly to semaglutide 2.4 mg via placebo, all adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity.

Tirzepatide 10 and 15 mg showed statistically significant greater reductions in weight, BMI, and HbA1c compared to semaglutide. Tirzepatide 15 mg was associated with significantly higher odds of achieving ≥ 5% and ≥ 15% weight reduction, alongside improvements in cardiometabolic risk factors such as waist circumference, fasting plasma glucose, and triglycerides. Both doses of tirzepatide demonstrated non-significant trends of greater improvement in high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure compared to semaglutide, while having a generally comparable safety profile.

In this ITC versus semaglutide 2.4 mg, tirzepatide 10 and 15 mg were associated with significantly greater weight, BMI, and HbA1c reduction. Tirzepatide 15 mg, in particular, showed statistically significant improvements in weight reduction and cardiometabolic risk factors.

### The role of tirzepatide, dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist, in the management of type 2 diabetes: The SURPASS clinical trials [^114ikC41]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Low credibility.

Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) based therapy is an established treatment option for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and is recommended early in the treatment algorithm due to its glycemic efficacy, weight reduction, and favorable cardiovascular outcomes. Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), on the other hand, was initially thought to have no potential as a glucose-lowering therapy because of observations showing no insulinotropic effect from supraphysiological infusion in people with T2DM. However, emerging evidence has illustrated that the co-infusion of GLP-1 and GIP has a synergistic effect, resulting in significantly increased insulin response and glucagonostatic response compared with the separate administration of each hormone. These observations have led to the development of a dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonist, known as a 'twincretin'.
Tirzepatide is a novel dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonist formulated as a synthetic peptide containing 39 amino acids, based on the native GIP sequence. Pre-clinical trials and phase 1 and 2 clinical trials indicate that tirzepatide has potent glucose-lowering and weight loss effects with adverse effects comparable to those of established GLP-1 receptor agonists. The long-term efficacy, safety, and cardiovascular outcomes of tirzepatide will be investigated in the SURPASS phase 3 clinical trial program. This paper reviews the pre-clinical and phase 1 and 2 trials for tirzepatide in the management of T2DM and provides an overview of the SURPASS clinical trials.

### In overweight or obese adults without diabetes, semaglutide increased weight loss and GI disorders [^112ox37B]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). High credibility.

In overweight or obese adults without diabetes, semaglutide significantly increased weight loss while also being associated with gastrointestinal (GI) disorders. The study reveals that the administration of semaglutide on a once-weekly basis is effective in reducing body weight. However, it is important to consider the potential side effects, particularly related to the GI tract. This observation suggests a dual outcome where the benefit of weight loss must be balanced with awareness of possible GI disturbances. These results indicate an important therapeutic option for weight management in the specified population.

### Post hoc analysis of SURPASS-1 to -5: Efficacy and safety of tirzepatide in adults with type 2 diabetes are independent of baseline characteristics [^111nCA4F]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). High credibility.

Newer incretin-based therapies for type 2 diabetes (T2D) have the potential to substantially reduce glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and weight with a low associated risk of hypoglycemia. This study aimed to assess the percentage of participants randomized to tirzepatide or comparator who achieved the composite endpoint of HbA1c ≤ 6.5% and weight reduction ≥ 10% without hypoglycemia across prespecified baseline characteristics: T2D duration (≤ 5, > 5–10, or > 10 years), sex, HbA1c (≤ 8.5% or > 8.5%), age (< 65 or ≥ 65 years), and body mass index (< 30, 30 to < 35, or ≥ 35 kg/m²).

- **Methods**: This post hoc analysis of SURPASS-1 through -5 evaluated adult study participants with T2D treated with tirzepatide 5, 10, or 15 mg versus placebo or active comparator. Missing HbA1c and weight values were imputed from mixed models for repeated measures. Logistic regression was used to compare tirzepatide versus comparators for the percentage of participants reaching the composite endpoint.

- **Results**: Across subgroups, the composite endpoint was achieved by a median of approximately 30%, 45%, and 54% of participants who received tirzepatide 5, 10, and 15 mg, respectively. This was consistent across baseline subgroups, except that a greater percentage of women than men achieved the composite endpoint. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were gastrointestinal in nature.

- **Conclusions**: In this post hoc analysis, tirzepatide achieved the composite outcome of glycemic control and weight loss with no hypoglycemia, irrespective of baseline characteristics. This may help clinicians as they consider treatment options for T2D.

### Long-term cost-effectiveness analysis of tirzepatide versus semaglutide 1.0 mg for the management of type 2 diabetes in the United States [^117Wk8Wy]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

To evaluate the long-term cost-effectiveness of tirzepatide (5, 10, and 15mg doses), a novel glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, versus semaglutide 1.0mg, an injectable GLP-1 receptor agonist, this study analyzed data based on the results of the head-to-head SURPASS-2 trial from a US healthcare payer perspective.

The PRIME Type 2 Diabetes Model was utilized to project clinical and cost outcomes over a 50-year time horizon. Baseline cohort characteristics, treatment effects, and adverse event rates were derived from the 40-week SURPASS-2 trial. Intensification to insulin therapy occurred when HbA1c reached 7.5%, consistent with American Diabetes Association recommendations. Direct costs in 2021 US dollars (US$) and health state utilities were sourced from published literature. Future costs and clinical benefits were discounted at 3% annually.

All three doses of tirzepatide were associated with lower diabetes-related complication rates, improved life expectancy, improved quality-adjusted life expectancy, and higher direct costs compared to semaglutide. This resulted in incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of US$ 75,803, 58,908, and 48,785 per quality-adjusted life year gained for tirzepatide 5, 10, and 15mg, respectively, versus semaglutide. Tirzepatide remained cost-effective versus semaglutide over a range of sensitivity analyses.

Long-term projections based on the SURPASS-2 trial results indicate that 5, 10, and 15mg doses of tirzepatide are likely to be cost-effective.

### Tirzepatide and health-related quality of life in adults with obesity or overweight: Results from the SURMOUNT-3 phase 3 randomized trial [^111UJ1hp]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Tirzepatide reduced weight significantly more than placebo in adults with obesity or overweight who had already achieved ≥ 5% weight reduction with a 12-week intensive lifestyle intervention in the SURMOUNT-3, a phase 3, 72-week, randomized, double-blind clinical trial. This analysis evaluates health-related quality of life (HRQoL) with tirzepatide versus placebo treatment in the SURMOUNT-3 randomized population and selected subgroups.

- **Materials and Methods**: The randomized population received placebo (N = 292) or tirzepatide at the maximum tolerated dose (N = 287) for 72 weeks. HRQoL was assessed from randomization to week 72 using the Short Form-36 Version 2 Health Survey acute form, Impact of Weight on Quality of Life-Lite Clinical Trials Version, 5-level EQ-5D version Health State Index, EQ visual analogue scale, and the Patient Global Impression of Status (PGIS) for Physical Activity. In tirzepatide recipients, changes in HRQoL scores from randomization to week 72 were descriptively summarized by achievement of weight reduction thresholds, and for those with versus without physical function limitations at randomization, identified with PGIS for Physical Activity.

- **Results**: Tirzepatide was associated with significantly larger improvements than placebo in most HRQoL measures from randomization to 72 weeks. Improvements in tirzepatide recipients were generally numerically larger in those who met greater weight reduction thresholds. HRQoL score changes showed greater improvements for adults with versus without physical function limitations for all measures.

### Incretin mimetics for weight loss forgive nonadherence [^1145TSkd]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

We now use the models and metrics of Section 2 to investigate the effects of nonadherence to semaglutide and tirzepatide. In Sections 3.1 and 3.3, we assume that patients miss each dose randomly and independently of their prior doses; missing a dose one week does not make the patient any more or less likely to miss a dose the following week. We relax this independence assumption in Section 3.4 and consider the effects of positive or negative correlations in missed doses.

- **Average weight loss**: Figure 2A plots the average weight loss (denoted ⟨X⟩ and defined in equation (8)) as a function of the proportion of doses taken (denoted p) over a long period. Figure 2 predicts that semaglutide and tirzepatide are very "forgiving" in that substantial weight loss is achieved despite lapses in missed doses. For instance, Figure 2A predicts that a patient prescribed a once-weekly dose of either 2.4 mg of semaglutide or 5 mg of tirzepatide maintains around a 15% reduction in body weight if they tend to miss about one dose out of every five doses, i.e. p = 80%. In practical terms, p = 80% corresponds to missing nearly one dose every month. Furthermore, at this same p = 80% level of adherence, a once-weekly prescription of either 10 or 15 mg of tirzepatide yields 20% or 23% weight loss, respectively.

- **Figure 2**: Missed doses do not proportionately decrease efficacy. Panel A plots the average body weight loss (denoted ⟨X⟩ and defined in equation (8)) as a function of adherence p for different drugs and dose sizes. Panel B shows how missed doses reduce weight loss relative to perfect adherence.

### Efficacy and safety of semaglutide compared with liraglutide and placebo for weight loss in patients with obesity: a randomised, double-blind, placebo and active controlled, dose-ranging, phase 2 trial [^113bU4Z9]. Lancet (2018). High credibility.

Obesity is a major public health issue, and new pharmaceuticals for weight management are needed. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue semaglutide in comparison with liraglutide and a placebo in promoting weight loss.

- **Methods**: We conducted a randomised, double-blind, placebo and active-controlled, multicentre, dose-ranging, phase 2 trial. The study was carried out in eight countries involving 71 clinical sites. Eligible participants were adults (≥ 18 years) without diabetes and with a body mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m² or more. Participants were randomly assigned (6:1) to each active treatment group — either semaglutide (0.05 mg, 0.1 mg, 0.2 mg, 0.3 mg, or 0.4 mg; initiated at 0.05 mg per day and incrementally escalated every 4 weeks) or liraglutide (3.0 mg; initiated at 0.6 mg per day and escalated by 0.6 mg per week) — or to a matching placebo group (equal injection volume and escalation schedule to the active treatment group) using a block size of 56. All treatment doses were delivered once daily via subcutaneous injections. Participants and investigators were masked to the assigned study treatment but not the target dose. The primary endpoint was percentage weight loss at week 52. The primary analysis was performed using intention-to-treat ANCOVA estimation, with missing data derived from the placebo pool.

- **Findings**: Between Oct 1, 2015, and Feb 11, 2016, 957 individuals were randomly assigned (102–103 participants per active treatment group and 136 in the pooled placebo group).

### Indirect comparative efficacy and safety of tirzepatide 10 and 15 mg versus semaglutide 2.4 mg for the management of obesity and overweight in patients with type 2 diabetes [^113FkVU7]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

- **Efficacy outcomes**: Tirzepatide 10 and 15 mg were associated with statistically significant greater reductions in body weight (kg) (mean difference [MD] [95% CI]: −2.80 kg [−4.56, −1.04], −4.90 kg [−6.62, −3.18]), body weight (%) (MD [95% CI]: −2.53% [−4.20, −0.86], −4.83% [−6.50, −3.16]) and BMI (MD [95% CI]: −1.00 kg/m² [−1.61, −0.39], −1.80 kg/m² [−2.41, −1.19]) versus semaglutide, with tirzepatide 15 mg comparisons having larger mean differences than tirzepatide 10 mg comparisons. These results align with the arm-level results from each trial, where tirzepatide 10 and 15 mg demonstrated greater reductions in body weight (−13.43% and −15.65%, respectively) compared to semaglutide 2.4 mg (−10.64%).

- **Weight and waist reduction efficacy**: Indirect treatment comparison (ITC) results show forest plots for efficacy estimand ITC results comparing tirzepatide (10 and 15 mg once per week [QW]) versus semaglutide 2.4 mg QW for change from baseline (CfB) in weight (kg), CfB in weight (%), and CfB in waist circumference (cm). The point indicates the mean difference (MD) and the lines indicate the 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Point estimates to the left of the dotted line indicate where tirzepatide was associated with an improvement over semaglutide, and statistical significance is indicated where the 95% CIs do not overlap the dotted line.

Tirzepatide 15 mg was associated with statistically significant greater odds of participants achieving ≥ 5% and ≥ 15% weight reduction versus semaglutide, while tirzepatide 10 mg was associated with similar outcomes.

### Cardiometabolic risk effects of weight-loss medications: An updated network meta-analysis [^112KbJxN]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

As a result of the withdrawal of lorcaserin and the approval of tirzepatide and semaglutide, we conducted a new network meta-analysis to assess the overall and comparative effects of six US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved weight-loss medications on the cardiometabolic risk profile of obese adults, and to determine which of these medications is best in improving cardiometabolic risk factors.

We searched our databases for randomized clinical trials of the effects of weight-loss drugs approved by the FDA as of April 2024 in obese adults taking them for one year or more, compared with placebo or between the agents. We performed pairwise and network meta-analyses, with results reported as weighted and standardized mean differences.

A total of 31 trials with 24,792 participants were included in this network meta-analysis. The quality of evidence was rated as moderate in most cases using the GRADE system. Compared with placebo, the weight-loss drugs resulted in moderate reductions in fasting glucose of 11.12 mg/dL (95% CI, -13.70, -8.53), glycosylated hemoglobin of 0.60% (95% CI, -0.75, -0.45), and waist circumference of 5.28 cm (95% CI, -6.57, -4.00), with minimal or modest benefits of clinical relevance in blood pressure and cholesterol profile. Additionally, we found tirzepatide to be relatively good overall in comparisons between drugs.

This study found that six FDA-approved weight-loss drugs had a moderately beneficial effect on the cardiometabolic risk profile. In general, tirzepatide was more effective than other pharmacotherapies.
