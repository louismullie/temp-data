## Question

Can acetazolamide be used to treat necrotizing fasciitis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether acetazolamide can be used to treat necrotizing fasciitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about acetazolamide's pharmacology and labeled indications. Then, I should review the pathophysiology and standard-of-care management for necrotizing fasciitis. Next, I will compare mechanisms to assess plausibility, search for any direct evidence or guideline support, evaluate potential harms in this clinical context, and finally synthesize a clear clinical recommendation [^114PMQwU] [^1161PQHd] [^113GSnmq].

> Let me first confirm the drug profile: acetazolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor indicated for controlling fluid secretion (such as in glaucoma), certain seizure disorders, and diuresis in abnormal fluid retention; importantly, it is explicitly characterized as a nonbacteriostatic sulfonamide with no antimicrobial activity, and it carries significant risks including severe sulfonamide hypersensitivity, hematologic toxicity, metabolic acidosis, and dangerous interactions with high-dose salicylates, so I need to ensure I am not overlooking any anti-infective properties because none are described in its labeling [^114PMQwU] [^112KSmyx] [^111BrMnH].

> Next, I should review necrotizing fasciitis itself: NF is a rapidly progressive, often polymicrobial deep soft-tissue infection that causes fascial necrosis and systemic toxicity; outcomes hinge on immediate empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics and urgent surgical exploration and debridement, ideally within hours of presentation, with repeat debridements until no further necrosis is present — so delaying these steps increases mortality, and I should double-check that timelines are indeed within the first 6–12 hours as many guidelines emphasize [^1161PQHd] [^113GSnmq] [^112aMeRh].

> Hold on, I should verify the exact empiric regimens recommended so I don't overgeneralize: guidelines endorse MRSA-active therapy such as vancomycin or linezolid combined with broad gram-negative and anaerobic coverage with options like piperacillin-tazobactam, a carbapenem, or ceftriaxone plus metronidazole, with consideration of clindamycin for its antitoxin effect in suspected toxin-mediated infections, followed by de-escalation once cultures and sensitivities return — this frames the standard against which any proposed agent must be compared [^1161PQHd] [^111uc3NL] [^1113mh5p].

> Now, I will examine mechanistic fit: NF requires rapid bacterial killing, toxin suppression, and physical removal of devitalized tissue, whereas acetazolamide alters renal bicarbonate handling and aqueous humor production and can precipitate metabolic acidosis; wait, let me verify whether diuresis could theoretically help edema — no, that does not address the microvascular thrombosis, tissue hypoperfusion, and toxin-driven injury central to NF pathogenesis, and acetazolamide's acidosis risk could worsen sepsis-related metabolic derangements rather than help [^114PMQwU] [^112KSmyx] [^113GSnmq].

> But wait, what if there are outlier reports or guideline mentions supporting off-label use? I need to check the provided guidelines and evidence syntheses; there are no recommendations or trials supporting acetazolamide for NF, and comprehensive reviews and guidelines consistently center on surgical source control with appropriate antimicrobials, without any role for carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, so I should confirm I'm not missing a niche use — none is evident here [^1161PQHd] [^1171YDpW] [^113GSnmq].

> I should also assess potential harm in this patient population: acetazolamide can trigger severe sulfonamide reactions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and blood dyscrasias, worsen acid–base status via metabolic acidosis, and interact dangerously with high-dose aspirin — these risks are especially concerning in critically ill NF patients who require hemodynamic optimization, procedures, and close metabolic and hematologic monitoring, so using a nonbeneficial agent with these hazards is unjustifiable [^112KSmyx] [^111BrMnH] [^115bBNev].

> Hmm, wait a minute — could one argue for perioperative fluid management benefits? Let me reconsider: even if diuresis were desired, acetazolamide's relatively weak natriuresis, propensity for electrolyte disturbances, and acidosis risk make it a poor choice in septic surgical patients compared with standard critical care diuretics when indicated, and in any case it offers no anti-infective or antitoxin benefit relevant to NF control [^111fBK7f] [^112KSmyx] [^113GSnmq].

> Putting this together, I should be explicit: no, acetazolamide cannot and should not be used to treat necrotizing fasciitis, because it has no antimicrobial or antitoxin activity, there is no supportive evidence or guideline endorsement, and its use could delay lifesaving broad-spectrum antibiotics and urgent surgical debridement, violating established standards of care and potentially worsening outcomes [^1161PQHd] [^113GSnmq] [^112aMeRh].

> Clinical recommendation: if NF is suspected, I need to ensure immediate empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics with MRSA coverage are started, obtain emergent surgical consultation for exploration and debridement within hours, repeat debridements until source control is achieved, and tailor antibiotics to culture results; adjuncts such as IVIG or hyperbaric oxygen lack sufficient evidence for routine use, and acetazolamide has no role in the management of necrotizing fasciitis [^1161PQHd] [^113GSnmq] [^1171YDpW].

---

Acetazolamide is **not indicated** [^114PMQwU] for necrotizing fasciitis and should not be used as part of its management. The standard of care is **early surgical debridement** [^112aMeRh] and **broad-spectrum antibiotics** [^1161PQHd] with supportive care [^113GSnmq]. Acetazolamide has no antimicrobial or antitoxin activity [^114PMQwU] and may cause metabolic acidosis, electrolyte disturbances [^111M1fFu], and severe hypersensitivity reactions [^117YTjgC], which can worsen outcomes in critically ill patients. There is **no clinical evidence** or guideline support for its use in necrotizing fasciitis [^1171YDpW].

---

## Pharmacological properties of acetazolamide

Acetazolamide is a **carbonic anhydrase inhibitor** [^114PMQwU] that reduces bicarbonate reabsorption, leading to metabolic acidosis and diuresis. It is used for glaucoma, altitude sickness, and some epilepsies but has **no antimicrobial activity** or antitoxin effects relevant to necrotizing fasciitis [^114PMQwU].

---

## Current standard of care for necrotizing fasciitis

Necrotizing fasciitis requires **immediate surgical debridement** within 12 hours [^112aMeRh]; **broad-spectrum antibiotics** covering MRSA, gram-negatives, and anaerobes [^111uc3NL]; and aggressive supportive care [^113GSnmq]. Delays in surgery or antibiotics increase mortality [^113GSnmq].

---

## Clinical evidence regarding acetazolamide in necrotizing fasciitis

There is **no clinical evidence** supporting acetazolamide for necrotizing fasciitis [^1171YDpW]. No trials, case reports, or guidelines recommend its use, and it lacks antimicrobial or antitoxin effects [^1161PQHd] [^114PMQwU].

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects of acetazolamide in necrotizing fasciitis

Acetazolamide can cause metabolic acidosis, electrolyte disturbances [^111M1fFu], and severe hypersensitivity reactions [^117YTjgC], which are **dangerous in critically ill patients** with necrotizing fasciitis [^113GSnmq].

- **Metabolic acidosis**: Worsens shock and organ dysfunction [^111M1fFu].
- **Electrolyte disturbances**: Hypokalemia and hyponatremia can cause arrhythmias and neuromuscular issues [^111M1fFu].
- **Hypersensitivity reactions**: Severe sulfonamide reactions (SJS, TEN, anaphylaxis) can be fatal [^117YTjgC].
- **Drug interactions**: Risky with aspirin, phenytoin, and others [^111M1fFu] [^115VKPCL].

---

## Comparison with standard treatments

Acetazolamide is **inferior to standard care** (early surgery, broad-spectrum antibiotics, supportive care) and offers no proven benefit in necrotizing fasciitis [^113GSnmq] [^1161PQHd].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

No guidelines or expert recommendations support acetazolamide for necrotizing fasciitis [^113GSnmq]. It is **not recommended** by IDSA [^1161PQHd], WSES [^111Gm1BN], or EAST [^112aMeRh].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Acetazolamide is **not indicated** [^114PMQwU] for necrotizing fasciitis and should not be used. Management should focus on **early surgical debridement** [^112aMeRh], **broad-spectrum antibiotics** [^1161PQHd], and supportive care [^113GSnmq].

### Acetazolamide [^111M1fFu]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Increasing the dose of acetazolamide does not increase diuresis and may increase the incidence of drowsiness and/or paresthesia. Often, an increased dose results in decreased diuresis. However, under certain circumstances, very large doses have been administered alongside other diuretics to secure diuresis in complete refractory failure.

- **Information for patients**: Adverse reactions common to all sulfonamide derivatives may occur, including anaphylaxis, fever, rash (such as erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis), crystalluria, renal calculus, bone marrow depression, thrombocytopenic purpura, hemolytic anemia, leukopenia, pancytopenia, and agranulocytosis. Early detection of such reactions is crucial, and in these cases, the drug should be discontinued, and appropriate therapy instituted.

- **Pulmonary considerations**: In patients with pulmonary obstruction or emphysema, where alveolar ventilation may be impaired, acetazolamide can precipitate or aggravate acidosis and should be used with caution.

- **Drug interactions**: Caution is advised for patients receiving concomitant high-dose aspirin and acetazolamide, as anorexia, tachypnea, lethargy, metabolic acidosis, coma, and death have been reported [see WARNINGS].

- **Blood glucose levels**: Both increases and decreases in blood glucose levels have been described in patients treated with acetazolamide. This should be taken into consideration for patients with impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes mellitus.

Necrotizing fasciitis and necrotizing cellulitis are serious cutaneous complications in varicella patients. Differentiation between necrotizing cellulitis and necrotizing fasciitis can initially be challenging due to the indistinct clinical course at the onset of infection and the lack of definitive diagnostic criteria. This paper reports two cases of children with necrotizing cellulitis that developed after varicella infection. The study aims to draw the attention of healthcare providers to necrotizing cellulitis, which demonstrated a slower clinical course compared to necrotizing fasciitis. The condition recovered with conservative treatment approaches without the need for aggressive surgical intervention.

### Photobiomodulation to treat necrotizing fasciitis [^115vwAjt]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

The spread of odontogenic infections associated with comorbidities, such as diabetes mellitus, can result in a potentially lethal complication with rapid necrosis of the superficial fascia, known as necrotizing fasciitis. In this case report, a 52-year-old female patient with a fasting blood glucose level of 303 mg/dL presented with necrotizing fasciitis associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus in the left cervical-thoracic region. Treatment included antibiotics, cervicotomy, abscess drainage, and 10 sessions of photobiomodulation with twice-weekly applications of the red wavelength laser to correct tissue loss in the left cervical region. As a result of this treatment, there was an increase in tissue healing and granulation tissue formation, absence of necrotic areas, contraction of the wound edges, and total wound repair. This case highlights the effectiveness of photobiomodulation in optimizing healing and modulating the inflammatory pattern in the treatment of necrotizing fasciitis sequelae.

### Outcome of necrotizing fasciitis and Fournier's gangrene with and without hyperbaric oxygen therapy: a retrospective analysis over 10 years [^113VwLst]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

Necrotizing soft tissue infections (NSTI) are rare, life-threatening diseases associated with a severe systemic inflammatory cascade triggered by bacterial toxins and a high risk of mortality. Two major types are necrotizing fasciitis (NF) and Fournier's gangrene (FG), which occur in mono- and polymicrobial variants. Irrespective of the etiology and pathogen spectrum, NSTI require immediate and extensive surgical debridement, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and intensive supportive care.

Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) constitutes an adjunct treatment, the beneficial effects of which are attributable to high oxygen gradients in the tissues as a result of breathing 100% oxygen under 1.5–3 times atmospheric pressure. Hyperoxygenation decelerates the infectious progress by improving the function of neutrophilic granulocytes and reduces tissue edema. Reactive oxygen species exert bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects on aerobes and anaerobes. Furthermore, high oxygen levels ameliorate tissue regeneration and improve the efficacy of antibiotics, especially in biofilm-forming microbes. However, evidence for the benefits of HBOT in terms of survival and clinical outcomes of patients with NF and FG is still limited.

The aim of our study was to assess in-hospital mortality and outcomes of patients with NF and FG treated in our center in the last decade and to analyze the effects of patient, disease, and treatment-related factors, particularly HBOT, on these parameters. For the latter, patients were stratified into three groups: one without the requirement of HBOT, one tr.

### Necrotizing fasciitis: Literature review of contemporary strategies for diagnosing and management with three case reports: torso, abdominal wall, upper and lower limbs [^1162uXWo]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Necrotizing soft tissue infection (NSTI) is a rare but potentially fatal infection involving the skin, subcutaneous tissue, and muscle. It is usually accompanied by systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and requires prolonged intensive care treatment. Necrotizing fasciitis is characterized by widespread necrosis of the subcutaneous tissue and fasciae. However, necrotizing fasciitis, as a soft tissue infection "per se", typically does not cause myonecrosis but does invade the deep fascia and muscle. Its rapid and destructive clinical course is assumed to be caused by polymicrobial symbiosis and synergy.

Monomicrobial infection is usually associated with immunocompromised patients, such as those with cancer, diabetes mellitus, vascular insufficiencies, organ transplantation, or who are alcohol abusers. Many aerobic and anaerobic pathogens may be involved, including Bacteroides, Clostridium, Peptostreptococcus, Enterobacteriaceae, Proteus, Pseudomonas, and Klebsiella. Group A hemolytic streptococcus and Staphylococcus aureus, alone or in synergism, are the initiating infecting bacteria. Typical sites of infection include the extremities (primarily the lower extremities), abdomen, and perineum.

In most NSTI cases, anaerobic bacteria are present, usually in combination with aerobic gram-negative organisms. They proliferate in an environment of local tissue hypoxia. Due to lower oxidation-reduction potential, they produce gases such as hydrogen, nitrogen, hydrogen sulfide, and methane, which accumulate in soft tissue spaces due to reduced solubility in water. Establishing the diagnosis of necrotizing fasciitis is essential, as the clinical presentation.

### Modern concepts of the diagnosis and treatment of necrotizing fasciitis [^115kSUPV]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Necrotizing fasciitis is a potentially fatal infection involving rapidly progressive, widespread necrosis of the superficial fascia. The purpose of this review is to examine modern concepts of the treatment and diagnosis of necrotizing fasciitis.

Necrotizing fasciitis is characterized by widespread necrosis of the subcutaneous tissue and the fascia. Although the pathogenesis of necrotizing fasciitis is still open to speculation, the rapid and destructive clinical course is thought to be due to multibacterial symbiosis. During the last two decades, scientists have found that the pathogenesis is usually polymicrobial rather than monomicrobial. Though no well-controlled clinical trials have compared the efficacy of various diagnostic imaging modalities for necrotizing infections, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is preferred for detecting soft tissue infection. MRI provides unsurpassed soft tissue contrast and spatial resolution, has high sensitivity in detecting soft tissue fluid, and has multiplanar capabilities.

Percutaneous needle aspiration followed by prompt Gram's staining and culture for rapid bacteriologic diagnosis in soft tissue infections is recommended. Surgery, complemented by antibiotics, is the primary treatment for necrotizing fasciitis.

Wide, extensive debridement of all tissues that can be easily elevated off the fascia with gentle pressure should be undertaken.

### Skin-sparing débridement for necrotizing fasciitis in children [^111sNLpa]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Necrotizing fasciitis is a serious soft-tissue infection associated with sepsis and tissue destruction. Surgical management usually requires extensive débridement of necrotic fascia and overlying skin, with significant aesthetic and functional consequences. The authors review the outcome of all recent cases of necrotizing fasciitis treated with skin-sparing débridement at their institution.

- **Methods**: The authors conducted a retrospective review of all of their cases of necrotizing fasciitis treated with skin-sparing débridement. Medical records were evaluated with a standard form gathering relevant demographic and clinical data. All cases were confirmed as necrotizing fasciitis histologically.

- **Results**: Ten patients were admitted with a diagnosis of necrotizing fasciitis. The median age of the patients was 4.9 years (range, 1.7 to 15.1 years). The majority of initial lesions were caused by chickenpox, mostly on the trunk. Interval from admission to surgery was 6 hours (range, 1 to 27.5 hours), with a median hospital stay of 11 days (range, 5 to 43 days). Median fasciectomy was 2.5 percent (range, 1 to 15 percent) of total body surface area, with a median skin excision of 0.25 percent of total body surface area (range, 0.1 to 3 percent). All patients received intravenous amoxicillin/clavulanic acid plus clindamycin. Delayed direct closure was possible for all patients. Median follow-up was 17 months (range, 3 to 79 months). There was no death in this series.

- **Conclusion**: This surgical management restricts skin excision to the area of definite skin necrosis.

### Are there any reasons to change our behavior in necrotizing fasciitis with the advent of new antibiotics [^116gdhTz]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

The treatment of necrotizing fasciitis requires a multifaceted approach, consisting of surgical source control with immediate surgical debridement along with life support, clinical monitoring, and antimicrobial therapy. Many drugs are now available for the treatment of this life-threatening infectious disease, and the purpose of this review is to provide the reader with an updated overview of the newest therapeutic options.

Recent findings indicate that because most necrotizing soft tissue infections are polymicrobial, broad-spectrum coverage is advisable. Acceptable monotherapy regimens include piperacillin-tazobactam or a carbapenem. However, drugs such as ceftolozane-tazobactam, and ceftazidime-avibactam in association with an antianaerobic agent (such as metronidazole or clindamycin) are currently available as valuable alternatives. The new cephalosporins active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), ceftaroline, and ceftobiprole share similar antibacterial activity against Gram-positive cocci, and they might be considered as an alternative to nonbetalactam anti-MRSA agents for necrotizing fasciitis management. Two new long-acting lipoglycopeptides, oritavancin and dalbavancin, share the indications for acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections and have similar activity against Gram-positive cocci, including MRSA and streptococci.

Carbapenem-sparing agents are particularly suitable for antimicrobial stewardship strategy. The new long-acting lipoglycopeptides are very effective in treating necrotizing fasciitis and are highly attractive options in this regard.

### Acetazolamide [^114PMQwU]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Acetazolamide is a potent carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, effective in controlling fluid secretion, such as in certain types of glaucoma, treating certain convulsive disorders like epilepsy, and promoting diuresis in cases of abnormal fluid retention, for example, in cardiac edema. Unlike mercurial diuretics, acetazolamide is a nonbacteriostatic sulfonamide with a chemical structure and pharmacological activity distinctly different from bacteriostatic sulfonamides.

Acetazolamide acts specifically on carbonic anhydrase, the enzyme involved in the reversible reaction of carbon dioxide hydration and carbonic acid dehydration. By inhibiting this enzyme in the eye, acetazolamide decreases the secretion of aqueous humor, resulting in reduced intraocular pressure. This is advantageous in glaucoma and certain nonglaucomatous conditions. Evidence suggests acetazolamide is beneficial as an adjuvant in treating certain central nervous system dysfunctions, such as epilepsy, by retarding abnormal, paroxysmal, excessive discharge from central nervous system neurons.

The diuretic effect of acetazolamide stems from its action in the kidney on the reversible reaction of carbon dioxide hydration and carbonic acid dehydration. This results in renal loss of bicarbonate ions, which in turn carries out sodium, water, and potassium. Consequently, it leads to urine alkalinization and promotes diuresis.

### Management of necrotizing fasciitis in diabetic patients [^112vW9SR]. Journal of Diabetes and its Complications (2007). Low credibility.

Necrotizing fasciitis is a life-threatening condition in diabetic patients; its management and the salvage of the patient is a formidable challenge. Diabetes mellitus is one of the serious conditions associated with necrotizing fasciitis, primarily affecting the microvascular circulation. We review our experience and present our approach to necrotizing fasciitis in patients with diabetes mellitus.

All cases of necrotizing fasciitis treated at Inonu University, Turgut Ozal Medical Center, from January 1997 to December 2003 were reviewed. A review of 59 charts identified 11 cases that met the study criteria, excluding cases with necrosis due to other obvious causes. Three patients experienced the spread of infection without fatality. On average, 42 hospital days (ranging from 22 to 64 days), 17 intensive care unit days (ranging from 7 to 28 days), and three surgical procedures (ranging from 2 to 7) per patient were required.

Necrotizing fasciitis is an extremely serious infectious process affecting subcutaneous soft tissue, characterized by skin gangrene and vascular thromboses. Clearly, the mortality and morbidity associated with necrotizing fasciitis, even in diabetes, can be decreased with clinical awareness, early diagnosis, effective surgical debridement, and intensive supportive care.

### Acetazolamide [^112KSmyx]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Warnings

Fatalities, though rare, have occurred due to severe reactions to sulfonamides, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, fulminant hepatic necrosis, agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, other blood dyscrasias, and anaphylaxis. Sensitizations may recur when a sulfonamide is readministered, irrespective of the route of administration. If signs of hypersensitivity or other serious reactions occur, discontinue use of this drug.

Caution is advised for patients receiving concomitant high-dose aspirin and acetazolamide, as anorexia, tachypnea, lethargy, metabolic acidosis, coma, and death have been reported.

### Acetazolamide [^115bBNev]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Laboratory tests: To monitor for hematologic reactions common to all sulfonamides, it is recommended that a baseline CBC and platelet count be obtained on patients prior to initiating acetazolamide therapy and at regular intervals during therapy. If significant changes occur, early discontinuance and institution of appropriate therapy are important. Periodic monitoring of serum electrolytes is recommended.

- **Drug interactions**:
	- **Aspirin**: See warnings.
	- Acetazolamide modifies phenytoin metabolism with increased serum levels of phenytoin, which may enhance the occurrence of osteomalacia in some patients receiving chronic phenytoin therapy. Caution is advised in patients receiving chronic concomitant therapy.
	- By decreasing the gastrointestinal absorption of primidone, acetazolamide may decrease serum concentrations of primidone and its metabolites, potentially reducing the anticonvulsant effect. Caution is advised when beginning, discontinuing, or changing the dose of acetazolamide in patients receiving primidone.
	- Due to possible additive effects with other carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, concomitant use is not advisable.
	- Acetazolamide may increase the effects of other folic acid antagonists.
	- Acetazolamide may increase or decrease blood glucose levels, thus consideration should be taken in patients being treated with antidiabetic agents.
	- Acetazolamide decreases urinary excretion of amphetamine and may enhance the magnitude and duration of their effect.
	- Acetazolamide reduces urinary excretion of quinidine and may enhance its effect.

### Necrotizing fasciitis [^11721fja]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2011). Low credibility.

Necrotizing fasciitis (NF) is a rare, rapidly progressive bacterial soft tissue infection with a high risk for morbidity and mortality. Although more common in adults, NF also affects the pediatric population. Many bacterial organisms can cause NF, but group A Streptococcus is the most common monomicrobial cause of disease. Necrotizing fasciitis remains principally a clinical diagnosis, and it is often missed early in its presentation because of the difficulty in differentiating it from more common soft tissue infections. The criterion standard for diagnosis and the mainstay of therapy are surgical debridement. Time to initiation and completion of therapy remains the most important factor in patient outcome, highlighting the importance of early recognition and intervention in this potentially devastating disease.

### Steglatro [^111A3Uya]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum (Fournier's gangrene)**: Reports of necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum, also known as Fournier's gangrene, have been identified in postmarketing surveillance in patients with diabetes mellitus receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including Steglatro. This condition is a rare but serious and life-threatening necrotizing infection that requires urgent surgical intervention. Cases have occurred in both females and males, with serious outcomes including hospitalization, multiple surgeries, and death. Patients treated with Steglatro who present with pain or tenderness, erythema, or swelling in the genital or perineal area, along with fever or malaise, should be assessed for necrotizing fasciitis. If this condition is suspected, initiate treatment immediately with broad-spectrum antibiotics and, if necessary, surgical debridement. Steglatro should be discontinued, blood glucose levels should be closely monitored, and appropriate alternative therapy for glycemic control should be provided.

- **Genital mycotic infections**: Steglatro increases the risk of genital mycotic infections. Patients with a history of genital mycotic infections or who are uncircumcised are more likely to develop such infections. Monitor these patients and treat appropriately.

### Acetazolamide [^117GY37s]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Increasing the dose of acetazolamide does not increase diuresis and may increase the incidence of drowsiness and/or paresthesia. In fact, increasing the dose often results in a decrease in diuresis. Under certain circumstances, however, very large doses have been administered in conjunction with other diuretics to secure diuresis in cases of complete refractory failure.

Choroidal effusion and choroidal detachment have been reported following the use of acetazolamide in the post-operative period after ophthalmic surgery. Acetazolamide should be discontinued if choroidal effusion and/or choroidal detachment is suspected.

- **Information for patients**: Adverse reactions common to all sulfonamide derivatives may occur, including anaphylaxis, fever, rash (such as erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis), crystalluria, renal calculus, bone marrow depression, thrombocytopenic purpura, hemolytic anemia, leukopenia, pancytopenia, and agranulocytosis. Caution is advised for early detection of such reactions. If they occur, the drug should be discontinued and appropriate therapy initiated.

- **Use in patients with pulmonary obstruction or emphysema**: In patients where alveolar ventilation may be impaired, acetazolamide, which may precipitate or aggravate acidosis, should be used with caution.

- **Use in prevention of acute mountain sickness**: A gradual ascent is desirable to try to avoid acute mountain sickness. If rapid ascent is undertaken and acetazolamide is used, it should be noted that such use does not negate the need for prompt descent if severe forms of high altitude sickness occur, such as high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) or high altitude cerebral edema.

### Evaluation and management of necrotizing soft tissue infections [^112VJ38B]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Despite advances in antibiotic and surgical management, as well as supportive care for necrotizing soft tissue infections, morbidity and mortality remain substantial. Although clinical practice guidelines are in place, there is still much variability in the choice and duration of antibiotic therapy, the timing of initial surgical debridement, and the use of adjuvant medical therapies. This article offers an overview of necrotizing soft tissue infections, focusing on diagnostic and treatment modalities.

### World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) guidelines for management of skin and soft tissue infections [^111Gm1BN]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) encompass a variety of pathological conditions ranging from simple superficial infections to severe necrotizing soft tissue infections. Necrotizing soft tissue infections (NSTIs) are potentially life-threatening infections of any layer of the soft tissue compartment, associated with widespread necrosis and systemic toxicity. Successful management of NSTIs involves prompt recognition, timely surgical debridement or drainage, resuscitation, and appropriate antibiotic therapy. A worldwide, international panel of experts developed evidence-based guidelines for the management of soft tissue infections.

The multifaceted nature of these infections has led to a collaboration among surgeons, intensive care, and infectious diseases specialists, who have shared these guidelines, implementing clinical practice recommendations.

### Necrotizing fasciitis: Strategies for diagnosis and management [^1168TAvg]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Necrotizing fasciitis (NF) is uncommon and difficult to diagnose, causing progressive morbidity until the infectious process is diagnosed and treated medically and surgically. The literature addressing NF contains confusing information, inaccurate bacteriologic data, and antiquated antibiotic therapy. A delay in diagnosis is associated with a grave prognosis and increased mortality. The main goal of the clinician must be to establish the diagnosis and initially treat the patient within the standard of care. This review is intended as a guide for the clinician in making an early diagnosis of NF and initiating effective medical and surgical therapy.

### Necrotizing soft-tissue infection: Diagnosis and management [^112BLXFw]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Necrotizing soft-tissue infections (NSTIs) are highly lethal. They are frequent enough that general and specialty physicians will likely encounter at least one patient with NSTI during their practice. However, they are infrequent enough that familiarity with the disease is seldom achieved. Establishing the diagnosis of NSTI can be the main challenge in treating patients, and knowledge of all available tools is key for early and accurate diagnosis. The laboratory risk indicator for necrotizing fasciitis score can be helpful for distinguishing between cases of cellulitis, which should respond to medical management alone, and NSTI, which requires operative debridement in addition to antimicrobial therapy. Imaging studies are less helpful.

The mainstay of treatment is early and complete surgical debridement, combined with antimicrobial therapy, close monitoring, and physiologic support. Novel therapeutic strategies, including hyperbaric oxygen and intravenous immunoglobulin, have been described; however, their effect is controversial. Identification of patients at high risk of mortality is essential for the selection of patients who may benefit from future novel treatments and for the development and comparison of future trials.

### Acetazolamide [^115VKPCL]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Drug interactions:

- **Aspirin**: See warnings.

- **Phenytoin metabolism**: Acetazolamide modifies phenytoin metabolism, leading to increased serum levels of phenytoin, which may enhance the occurrence of osteomalacia in patients receiving chronic phenytoin therapy. Caution is advised in patients receiving chronic concomitant therapy.

- **Primidone absorption**: By decreasing the gastrointestinal absorption of primidone, acetazolamide may decrease serum concentrations of primidone and its metabolites, with a possible decrease in anticonvulsant effect. Caution is advised when beginning, discontinuing, or changing the dose of acetazolamide in patients receiving primidone.

- **Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors**: Because of possible additive effects, concomitant use of acetazolamide with other carbonic anhydrase inhibitors is not advisable.

- **Folic acid antagonists**: Acetazolamide may increase the effects of these drugs.

- **Blood glucose levels**: Acetazolamide may increase or decrease blood glucose levels. Consideration should be taken when treating patients with antidiabetic agents.

- **Amphetamine excretion**: Acetazolamide decreases urinary excretion of amphetamine and may enhance the magnitude and duration of its effect.

- **Quinidine excretion**: Acetazolamide reduces urinary excretion of quinidine and may enhance its effect.

- **Methenamine effect**: Acetazolamide may prevent the urinary antiseptic effect of methenamine.

- **Lithium excretion**: Acetazolamide increases lithium excretion, potentially decreasing lithium efficacy.

- **Sodium bicarbonate**: Concurrent use with acetazolamide increases the risk of renal calculus formation.

- **Cyclosporine levels**: Acetazolamide may elevate cyclosporine levels.

Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility:

Long-term studies in animals are ongoing to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of acetazolamide.

### The effect of NPWT on odontogenic cervical necrotizing fasciitis [^1118s5f4]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

- **Methods**: Preoperative preparation included anti-infection protocols, maintaining water-electrolyte balance and internal environment stability, correcting hypoalbuminemia, improving the nutritional status of the whole body, and actively controlling blood glucose to ensure successful perioperative management.

- **Emergency debridement operation**: An incision was made into the deep fascia and infection space. This involved the excision of liquefied and necrotic fat, as well as yellow and white "bean curd dregs" necrotic fascia tissue, and stimulation of non-contracting necrotic muscle, followed by clearance. The surgical area was expanded and explored to 2 cm above the normal fascia. A large amount of 3% hydrogen peroxide solution, saline, and 0.1% iodophor solution was used to wash the wound repeatedly.

- **Treatment after debridement: The observation group** utilized negative pressure suction material (15×10 cm, Wuhan Weisdi Medical Science and Technology Co. Ltd.) to fill the infected space without leaving dead space. The negative pressure suction material was used to cover the closed wound surface, with a semipermeable membrane sealing the material to form a closed wound surface. The closed wound surface was checked for air leaks after connecting the negative pressure device to ensure smooth drainage (Fig. 1 A). Post-operation, continuous suction with negative pressure of 20 to 40 KPA and continuous drip of normal saline were used to keep the wound in a wet environment, which helped avoid blockage of the drainage tube and ensured adequate drainage. Based on the wound surface and drainage fluid, replacement of the negative pressure device was necessary every 7 to 12 days.

### Necrotizing fasciitis: Strategies for diagnosis and management [^114Fjoqz]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Necrotizing fasciitis (NF) is a rare soft tissue infection primarily involving the superficial fascia, resulting in extensive undermining of the surrounding tissues. If untreated, NF is invariably fatal; thus, a high index of suspicion for the diagnosis is required. Despite the use of modern, powerful antimicrobial drug regimens and advances in the care of critically ill patients, mortality remains high in NF. Overall mortality ranges from 25% to 73% in the published literature. The disease's manifestation can range from a fulminant presentation to a subtle and insidious development.

### Necrotizing fasciitis: Strategies for diagnosis and management [^117Notgj]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

The following is a list of recommendations to prevent the disease, as reported by the CDC:

- **Good hand washing**: Can prevent the spread of Group A Streptococcus (GAS) infection, especially after coughing, sneezing, and before preparing food or eating.
- **Patients with sore throats**: Should be seen by a doctor.
- **Patients with strep throat**: Should stay home until 24 hours after their last antibiotic dose.
- **Wounds**: Should be cleaned and monitored for signs of infection (redness, swelling, drainage, pain). Keeping the skin intact is an important factor in preventing NF.
- **Medical care**: Patients with an infected wound and fever should seek medical care.

### Periocular necrotizing fasciitis following retrobulbar injection [^116CK6Jg]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Management of periorbital NF is centered on the early recognition of clinical signs and symptoms. This mandates aggressive multidisciplinary treatment to avoid severe and permanent disfigurement, loss of vision, and mortality linked to misdiagnosis or delay in diagnosis. If prompt diagnosis is established, treatment by extensive surgical debridement and systemic antibiotics (with or without the use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy) can prevent a fulminant course with a fatal outcome. An optimal antibiotic regimen for methicillin-susceptible S. aureus skin and soft tissue infection is a higher dose of oxacillin (1–2 g intravenously, every 4 hours) with clindamycin (600 mg/kg intravenously, every 8 hours or 300–450 mg orally three times daily) because of oxacillin's excellent diffusion in soft tissue and its antitoxin properties. Our patient was given cloxacillin, ceftriaxone, and metronidazole because oxacillin and clindamycin were not available. The use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy can reduce the extent of hypoxic leukocyte dysfunction occurring within an area of hypoxia and infection, and provide oxygenation to otherwise ischemic areas, thus blocking the progression of NF and perhaps saving more of the eyelid and orbital tissue.

Some survivors might need extensive surgical intervention like orbital exenteration, as reported by Lazzeri et al. in their review of the published literature. Our patient also developed deep orbital tissue necrosis with eye involvement; exenteration was planned but the patient declined and self-discharged against medical advice and did not return for further treatment.

### World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) guidelines for management of skin and soft tissue infections [^116Ctuot]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Antimicrobial therapy in patients with necrotizing soft tissue infections involves the following:

- **Early empiric coverage**: Early appropriate empiric coverage against suspected pathogens should be initiated based upon the clinical setting for patients with NSTI (Recommendation 1 C).

- **Pathogens with exotoxins**: For patients whose clinical setting or gram stain suggests a rapidly progressive infection potentiated by exotoxins from gram-positive pathogens (S. pyogenes, CA-MRSA, Clostridial species), treatment with antimicrobial agents should be combined with antiribosomal agents, such as clindamycin or linezolid. Patients presenting with rapidly progressive infections with gram stains of tissue showing gram-negative pathogens (Aeromonas sp. Eikenella, Vibrio sp.) should be treated with antiribosomal agents targeting gram-negative pathogens, like tetracyclines (Recommendation 1 C).

- **MRSA coverage**: Appropriate empiric coverage against MRSA should be immediately initiated in patients with NSTI (Recommendation 1 C).

- **Polymicrobial infections**: Since it is impossible to exclude with certainty a polymicrobial necrotizing infection, an aggressive broad-spectrum empiric antimicrobial therapy should initially be selected to cover gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic organisms until culture-specific results and sensitivities are available (Recommendation 1 C).

- **De-escalation**: An appropriate de-escalation of antimicrobial therapy is suggested once culture results come back (Recommendation 1 C).

- **Supportive treatment**: Supportive treatment in managing NSTI must be early and aggressive to halt progression of the inflammatory process (Recommendation 1 C).

After admittance to the emergency department, we started treatment with aggressive fluid resuscitation, correction of laboratory parameters, hyperglycemia, and metabolic acidosis, adding an empirical combination of antibiotics: Penicillin G, Gentamycin, and Clindamycin. The first debridement was performed on the perineum area and continued to the scrotum, inguinal regions, and the lower abdominal wall (AW). We also performed an endoscopic lavage of the knee joint and fasciotomy, with radical debridement, of the anterior compartment of the left thigh. The anterior compartment was opened from the inguinal ligament to just above the knee joint. All opened wounds were copiously irrigated with hydrogen peroxide, 0.9% physiologic solution, and dressed with 1% povidone iodine solution.

After the initial debridement, the wounds were carefully monitored during the next 24 to 72 hours, and dressing changes were done twice daily. Adjuvant hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy was applied over the course of the next seven days. On the first day, the patient received two treatments of HBO therapy, followed by one treatment daily. HBO was given at 2.8 ATA for 90 minutes per day. We performed three additional debridement and necrectomy procedures to stabilize the wound. The fecal incontinence was treated with a diverting colostomy. The results of microbiological analysis of the perineum and thigh cultures showed a polymicrobial infection with Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Streptococcus pyogenes, and the presence of mixed anaerobes, including Bacteroides fragilis. Blood cultures were positive for…

### Necrotizing fasciitis [^114bmiX6]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2009). Low credibility.

Necrotizing fasciitis is a rare but life-threatening soft-tissue infection characterized by rapidly spreading inflammation and subsequent necrosis of the fascial planes and surrounding tissue. Infection typically follows trauma, although the inciting insult may be as minor as a scrape or an insect bite. Often caused by toxin-producing, virulent bacteria such as group A streptococcus and associated with severe systemic toxicity, necrotizing fasciitis is rapidly fatal unless diagnosed promptly and treated aggressively.

Necrotizing fasciitis is often initially misdiagnosed as a more benign soft-tissue infection. The single most important variable influencing mortality is time to surgical débridement. Thus, a high degree of clinical suspicion is necessary to avert potentially disastrous consequences. Orthopaedic surgeons are often the first to evaluate patients with necrotizing fasciitis and, as such, must be aware of the presentation and management of this disease. Timely diagnosis, broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, and aggressive surgical débridement of affected tissue are keys to the treatment of this serious, often life-threatening infection.

### Interventions for treating gas gangrene [^114VY8GX]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Gas gangrene is a rapidly progressive and severe disease resulting from bacterial infection, typically as the result of an injury. It has a high incidence of amputation and a poor prognosis. The condition necessitates early diagnosis and comprehensive treatments, which may include immediate wound debridement, antibiotic treatment, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, Chinese herbal medicine, systemic support, and other interventions. The efficacy and safety of many available therapies have not been confirmed.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of potential interventions in the treatment of gas gangrene compared with alternative interventions or no interventions.

- **Search methods**: In March 2015, we searched the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialized Register, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE, EBSCO CINAHL, Science Citation Index, the China Biological Medicine Database (CBM-disc), the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and the Chinese scientific periodical database of VIP INFORMATION (VIP) for relevant trials. We also searched reference lists of all identified trials and relevant reviews, as well as four trials registries for eligible research. There were no restrictions with respect to language, date of publication, or study setting.

- **Selection criteria**: We selected randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs that compared one treatment for gas gangrene with another treatment, or with no treatment.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Independently, two review authors selected potentially eligible studies.

### Necrotizing soft tissue infections: A review [^113GSnmq]. JAMA Surgery (2024). High credibility.

Necrotizing soft tissue infections (NSTIs) are severe, life- and limb-threatening infections with high rates of morbidity and mortality. Unfortunately, there has been minimal improvement in outcomes over time.

- **Observations**: NSTIs are characterized by their heterogeneity in microbiology, risk factors, and anatomical involvement. They often present with nonspecific symptoms, leading to a high rate of delayed diagnosis. Laboratory values and imaging help increase suspicion for NSTI, though ultimately, the diagnosis is clinical. Surgical exploration is warranted when there is high suspicion for NSTI, even if the diagnosis is uncertain. Thus, it is acceptable to have a certain rate of negative exploration.

Immediate empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics, further tailored based on tissue culture results, are essential and should be continued at least until surgical debridement is complete and the patient shows signs of clinical improvement. Additional research is needed to determine optimal antibiotic duration. Early surgical debridement is crucial for improved outcomes and should be performed as soon as possible, ideally within 6 hours of presentation. Subsequent debridements should be performed every 12 to 24 hours until the patient is showing signs of clinical improvement and there is no additional necrotic tissue within the wound. There are insufficient data to support the routine use of adjunct treatments such as hyperbaric oxygen therapy and intravenous immunoglobulin. However, clinicians should be aware of multiple ongoing efforts to develop more robust diagnostics.

### Acetazolamide [^111fBK7f]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Increasing the dose of acetazolamide does not increase diuresis and may increase the incidence of drowsiness and/or paresthesia. Often, increasing the dose results in a decrease in diuresis. Under certain circumstances, however, very large doses have been used in conjunction with other diuretics to secure diuresis in complete refractory failure.

- **Information for patients**: Adverse reactions common to all sulfonamide derivatives may occur, including anaphylaxis, fever, rash (such as erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis), crystalluria, renal calculus, bone marrow depression, thrombocytopenic purpura, hemolytic anemia, leukopenia, pancytopenia, and agranulocytosis. Caution is advised for early detection of such reactions, and the drug should be discontinued with appropriate therapy instituted.

	- In patients with pulmonary obstruction or emphysema, where alveolar ventilation may be impaired, acetazolamide, which may precipitate or aggravate acidosis, should be used with caution.

	- Gradual ascent is desirable to avoid acute mountain sickness. If rapid ascent is undertaken and acetazolamide tablets are used, it is important to note that such use does not obviate the need for prompt descent if severe forms of high altitude sickness occur, such as high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) or high altitude cerebral edema.

	- Caution is advised for patients receiving concomitant high-dose aspirin and acetazolamide, as anorexia, tachypnea, lethargy, metabolic acidosis, coma, and death have been reported (see WARNINGS).

Both increases and decreases in blood glucose levels may occur.

### Bexagliflozin [^115ANtpe]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum (Fournier's gangrene)**: Reports of necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum, known as Fournier's gangrene, have been identified in postmarketing surveillance in patients with diabetes mellitus who are receiving SGLT2 inhibitors. This condition is a rare but serious and life-threatening necrotizing infection that requires urgent surgical intervention. Cases have been reported in both females and males, with serious outcomes including hospitalization, multiple surgeries, and death.

	- Patients treated with bexagliflozin tablets who present with pain or tenderness, erythema, or swelling in the genital or perineal areas, along with fever or malaise, should be assessed for necrotizing fasciitis. If suspected, treatment should be started immediately with broad-spectrum antibiotics and, if necessary, surgical debridement. It is essential to discontinue bexagliflozin tablets, closely monitor blood glucose levels, and provide appropriate alternative therapy for glycemic control.

- **Genital mycotic infections**: Bexagliflozin increases the risk of genital mycotic infections [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Patients with a history of genital mycotic infections or those who are uncircumcised are more likely to develop these infections. It is important to monitor such patients and treat them appropriately.

### Necrotizing fasciitis: Literature review of contemporary strategies for diagnosing and management with three case reports: Torso, abdominal wall, upper and lower limbs [^114TSoaU]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Early clinical status during the first 24 hours usually includes minor trauma, skin infection like folliculitis or abscess, gangrene on the extremities, pressure sore(s), or a complicated surgical incision like hernia repair. The external signs on the skin may be erythema or induration. The patient usually feels pain at the site of the injury. There is a disproportion between the character of the injury and the intensity of the pain. Pain out of proportion to the apparent lesion severity should suggest a possible NF diagnosis.

During the next 2–4 days, the pain becomes more intense. In the clinical status, we find many symptoms of general toxicity like fever, dehydration, confusion, dizziness, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, weakness, and malaise. If the patient is not admitted to an ICU or the diagnosis is established late in its course, more serious clinical symptoms ensue. The limbs and the area of the body where the patient felt pain begin to swell and may show a purplish rash or blisters with "dish-wash" purulent or haemorrhagic fluid. Cutaneous changes may be minimal or may progress to blisters and bullae, and then to circumscribed necrosis of the skin. Also, emphysema and gas formations with crepitations in the overlying skin may appear. The pain grows but remains disproportionate to the clinical picture.

### Cervicofacial necrotizing fasciitis and drugs [^114rvNuK]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Necrotizing fasciitis (NF) is a devastating disease that typically affects immunocompromised patients, chronically debilitated patients, or drug users, but can also affect healthy patients. Necrotizing fasciitis can rapidly produce septic shock, requiring immediate surgical management of the necrotic tissue. It is a bacterial infection that progresses rapidly and has a high mortality rate, generally caused by aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. The patient was immunocompromised and a drug user.

During treatment, a combination of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy with ciprofloxacin and metronidazole was used, alongside activated charcoal dressing composed of carbonized fabric impregnated with 0.15% silver nitrate enveloped by a layer of fabric without activated carbon. Chemical-mechanical debridement involved the use of hydrogen peroxide, 0.9% saline, and povidone iodine. According to the patient's case, the treatment of NF requires broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy associated with surgical debridement, the use of activated charcoal for antiseptic compression, and general intensive care.

### Necrotizing fasciitis: Literature review of contemporary strategies for diagnosing and management with three case reports: Torso, abdominal wall, upper and lower limbs [^1159eVn9]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

This paper provides a comprehensive literature review of contemporary strategies for diagnosing and managing necrotizing fasciitis. It includes three case reports focusing on the torso, abdominal wall, and upper and lower limbs. The insights provided in this study highlight the complexities and challenges in accurately diagnosing and effectively managing this severe condition.

- **Case reports**: The paper details three distinct cases involving different anatomical regions, offering a unique perspective on the variations in clinical presentation and the treatment approaches required for each.

- **Diagnostic strategies**: Current diagnostic strategies are discussed, emphasizing the importance of early recognition and intervention to improve patient outcomes. Techniques such as imaging and laboratory tests are explored to underscore their role in the diagnostic process.

- **Management techniques**: The management of necrotizing fasciitis involves a multidisciplinary approach, incorporating surgical, medical, and supportive care. The paper elaborates on the importance of timely surgical intervention and the role of antibiotics and other supportive measures.

By examining these cases and reviewing contemporary literature, the authors aim to contribute valuable knowledge to the ongoing discussion surrounding the optimal strategies for addressing necrotizing fasciitis.

### Necrotizing soft tissue infections in the intensive care unit [^112WnwWn]. Critical Care Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Necrotizing soft tissue infection is a severe illness associated with significant morbidity and mortality. It is often caused by a wide spectrum of pathogens and is most frequently polymicrobial. Care for patients with necrotizing soft tissue infection requires a team approach with expertise from critical care, surgery, reconstructive surgery, and rehabilitation specialists.

The early diagnosis of necrotizing soft tissue infection is challenging; however, early recognition and complete surgical debridement are critical to successful management. Early initiation of appropriate broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy must consider the potential pathogens. Critical care management components such as initial fluid resuscitation, end-organ support, pain management, nutrition support, and wound care are all important aspects of caring for patients with this condition. Soft tissue reconstruction should account for both functional and cosmetic outcomes.

### Necrotizing fasciitis: strategies for diagnosis and management [^116QmLg2]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Necrotizing fasciitis (NF) is uncommon and difficult to diagnose, causing progressive morbidity until the infectious process is identified and treated both medically and surgically. Literature on NF contains confusing information, inaccurate bacteriologic data, and outdated antibiotic therapy. A delay in diagnosis is associated with a grave prognosis and increased mortality. The primary goal of the clinician must be to establish the diagnosis and initially treat the patient within the standard of care. This review is intended as a guide for clinicians in making an early diagnosis of NF and initiating effective medical and surgical therapy.

### Necrotizing fasciitis: Literature review of contemporary strategies for diagnosing and management with three case reports: torso, abdominal wall, upper and lower limbs [^114BaRTb]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

During surgical intervention, the following signs are of greatest importance for the NF diagnosis: grayish necrotic deep fascia, a lack of resistance of normally adherent muscular fascia to blunt finger dissection ("Finger test"), lack of bleeding from the fascia, and the presence of dish-water pus. Based on our surgical practice, we also recommend an early and very aggressive debridement of all involved tissue that can be easily elevated off of the fascia with gentle pressure or finger spreading. The surgical intervention, in which we removed all infected tissue in a single operation, rapidly improved the clinical course of the infection. All deep fascia and muscle should be inspected for potential involvement with streptococcal myositis or clostridial infection. We believe that the mass and the extension of soft tissue that must be initially excised depend on the body region in which the infection appeared. Nevertheless, the extent of debridement should not be needlessly limited because the novel plastic surgical techniques can cover every wound defect size.

Special attention should be paid to the upper and lower extremities, abdominal wall with intra-abdominal infection such as secondary peritonitis, and on the chest wall with persisting sternum infection and mediastinitis. The extent of debridement is very important on the extremities. In cases with compromised viability and compartment syndrome, additional fasciotomies of all fascio-cutaneous spaces should be performed. A suspected case of clostridial myonecrosis requires early surgical exploration and extensive debridement of all involved muscle.

Cellulitis and soft tissue infections encompass a diverse group of diseases, ranging from uncomplicated cellulitis to necrotizing fasciitis. Managing predisposing conditions is the primary means of prevention. Diagnosis of cellulitis is clinical, based on history and physical examination. Imaging may assist in characterizing purulent soft tissue infections and associated osteomyelitis. Treatment varies according to infection type. The foundation of treatment includes drainage of purulence and antibiotics, targeted at the infection's most likely cause.

### The diagnosis of necrotizing fasciitis [^1168y8wi]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

A delay in the diagnosis and appropriate treatment of necrotizing fasciitis has clearly been demonstrated to increase mortality. However, the paucity of specific cutaneous signs makes early recognition extremely difficult. This review highlights recent developments in the approaches to the diagnosis of necrotizing fasciitis.

- **Recent findings**: A clinical staging of necrotizing fasciitis is proposed to better define the progression of the disease. Several clinical subtypes of necrotizing fasciitis have been described recently, including hyperacute and sub-acute variants. Imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging and frozen section biopsies have been reported to be valuable in the early recognition of necrotizing fasciitis; however, availability and cost limit the routine use of these tests. Several diagnostic adjuncts have been developed recently to aid in early recognition. These include the fasciitis LRINEC (laboratory risk indicator for necrotizing fasciitis) score and transcutaneous tissue oxygen saturation monitoring. Some of these may have the potential for widespread application in the assessment of severe soft tissue infections.

Delayed recognition, with consequent massive soft tissue loss and sepsis, remains a deadly pitfall in the management of necrotizing fasciitis. With a better understanding of the clinical manifestations and the potential use and limitations of various diagnostic adjuncts available for the assessment of equivocal cases of soft tissue infections, it is hoped that a clear and logical approach to diagnosis will emerge.

To monitor for hematologic reactions common to all sulfonamides, it is recommended that a baseline CBC and platelet count be obtained on patients prior to initiating acetazolamide tablet therapy and at regular intervals during therapy. If significant changes occur, early discontinuance and the institution of appropriate therapy are important. Periodic monitoring of serum electrolytes is recommended.

- **Drug interactions**:
	- Aspirin - See warnings.
	- Acetazolamide modifies phenytoin metabolism with increased serum levels of phenytoin. This may increase or enhance the occurrence of osteomalacia in some patients receiving chronic phenytoin therapy. Caution is advised in patients receiving chronic concomitant therapy.
	- By decreasing the gastrointestinal absorption of primidone, acetazolamide may decrease serum concentrations of primidone and its metabolites, with a consequent possible decrease in anticonvulsant effect. Caution is advised when beginning, discontinuing, or changing the dose of acetazolamide in patients receiving primidone.
	- Because of possible additive effects with other carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, concomitant use is not advisable.
	- Acetazolamide may increase the effects of other folic acid antagonists.
	- Acetazolamide may increase or decrease blood glucose levels. Consideration should be taken in patients being treated with antidiabetic agents.
	- Acetazolamide decreases urinary excretion of amphetamine and may enhance the magnitude and duration of their effect.
	- Acetazolamide reduces urinary excretion of quinidine and may enhance its effect.

### Necrotizing fasciitis after high-dose rate brachytherapy and external beam radiation for prostate cancer: a case report [^111j419B]. BMC Urology (2017). Low credibility.

In recent years, the delayed side effects associated with radiotherapy for prostate cancer have drawn the interest of urologists. Although urosymphyseal fistula is one of these delayed side effects, this serious complication is rarely described in the literature and is poorly recognized.

- **Case presentation**: We report our experience in treating a 77-year-old male patient with necrotizing fasciitis after high-dose rate brachytherapy plus external beam radiation for prostate cancer. The patient was referred to our hospital with complaints of inguinal swelling and fever. He had a past history of radiotherapy for prostate cancer and subsequent transurethral operation for a stricture of the urethra. Computed tomography showed extensive gas within the femoral and retroperitoneal tissues and pubic bone fracture. Surgical exploration suggested that necrotizing fasciitis was caused by urosymphyseal fistula.

- **Conclusion**: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of necrotizing fasciitis caused by urosymphyseal fistula after radiotherapy for prostate cancer. There is a strong association between urosymphyseal fistula and prostate radiotherapy with subsequent surgical intervention for bladder neck contracture or urethral stricture. Therefore, surgical treatment for bladder neck contracture or urethral stricture after radiotherapy for prostate cancer should be performed with care. The present case emphasizes the importance of early diagnosis of urosymphyseal fistula. Immediate removal of necrotic tissues and subsequent urinary diversion in the present case may help prevent further complications.

### Necrotizing fasciitis caused by Staphylococcus aureus: The emergence of methicillin-resistant strains [^1171LdEW]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus is an uncommon causative agent of monomicrobial necrotizing fasciitis, but several cases have been noted over the years. Patients treated for necrotizing fasciitis between January 1998 and December 2008 in our institution were identified, and their medical records were reviewed. Of the 105 necrotizing fasciitis cases during the study period, 18 were caused by monomicrobial S. aureus infection (17%). The median age was 62 years (range, 12–81 years). Among this cohort, 10 patients had coexisting medical conditions or risk factors, including diabetes and hypertension. The lower limbs and upper limbs were the most commonly involved sites. Among the bacterial isolates, 8 were methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) and 10 were methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). One patient died in the MSSA group, and 5 patients died in the MRSA group. The mortality rate and other clinical characteristics were not significantly different between the two groups. However, all MRSA necrotizing fasciitis cases developed after the year 2000, which is significantly different from MSSA necrotizing fasciitis that predominantly occurred before the year 2000. In conclusion, S. aureus is an important pathogen of monomicrobial necrotizing fasciitis, and MRSA has emerged as the predominant causative agent in recent years. Therefore, MRSA-directed antibiotic therapy should be considered when treating patients suspected of having necrotizing fasciitis in endemic areas.

### Current diagnosis and management of necrotizing soft tissue infections: What you need to know [^112qNg37]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

Necrotizing soft tissue infections are rare bacterial infections of the skin and soft tissues characterized by high morbidity and mortality rates, necessitating prompt diagnosis and surgical intervention. These infections represent a spectrum of disease resulting in tissue necrosis that progresses rapidly; however, they remain a diagnostic challenge because the average surgeon or emergency medicine provider may see only one or two cases over the course of their career.

Diagnosis is largely clinical and is based on subtle physical examination findings, physiologic instability, and laboratory derangements. Aids to diagnosis, such as scoring systems and cross-sectional imaging, may be used. However, the findings are not specific, so management should not rely solely on these tools.

The most common cause of necrotizing soft tissue infection is polymicrobial infection. Specific bacteria, such as clostridial species, group A streptococcal, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and aquatic bacteria, may also be causative. Initial management includes broad-spectrum antibiotics, fluid resuscitation for severe sepsis, and early aggressive surgical debridement. Often, these patients require multiple operative debridements to achieve source control, and a low threshold for repeat debridement should be maintained because these infections can progress rapidly.

Once source control is achieved, patients may be left with extensive wounds requiring multidisciplinary care and wound management. Historically, necrotizing infections have been viewed based on mortality outcomes alone due to their rarity and severity.

### Life-threatening necrotizing fasciitis [^113pxG5Z]. Clinics in Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Necrotizing fasciitis is characterized by rapidly progressing necrosis of subcutaneous fat and fascia, which can be life-threatening without prompt recognition, surgical intervention, and immediate antibiotic therapy. Necrotizing fasciitis has been subdivided into type 1, or polymicrobial necrotizing fasciitis, and type 2, or group A streptococcal necrotizing fasciitis. In addition, synonyms, such as streptococcal gangrene and "flesh-eating bacteria syndrome", have been used in the literature.

### Necrotizing fasciitis after high-dose rate brachytherapy and external beam radiation for prostate cancer: A case report [^114FUNtZ]. BMC Urology (2017). Low credibility.

In recent years, the delayed side effects associated with radiotherapy for prostate cancer have drawn the interest of urologists. Although urosymphyseal fistula is one of these delayed side effects, this serious complication is rarely described in the literature and is poorly recognized.

- **Case presentation**: We report our experience in treating a 77-year-old male patient with necrotizing fasciitis after high-dose rate brachytherapy plus external beam radiation for prostate cancer. The patient was referred to our hospital with complaints of inguinal swelling and fever. He had a past history of radiotherapy for prostate cancer and a subsequent transurethral operation for a stricture of the urethra. Computed tomography showed extensive gas within the femoral and retroperitoneal tissues and pubic bone fracture. Surgical exploration suggested that necrotizing fasciitis was caused by urosymphyseal fistula.

- **Conclusion**: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of necrotizing fasciitis caused by urosymphyseal fistula after radiotherapy for prostate cancer. There is a strong association between urosymphyseal fistula and prostate radiotherapy with subsequent surgical intervention for bladder neck contracture or urethral stricture. Therefore, surgical treatment for bladder neck contracture or urethral stricture after radiotherapy for prostate cancer should be performed with care.

The present case emphasizes the importance of early diagnosis of urosymphyseal fistula. Immediate removal of necrotic tissues and subsequent urinary diversion in the present case may be crucial for management.

### World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) guidelines for management of skin and soft tissue infections [^111FPM45]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Necrotizing soft tissue infections (NSTIs) include necrotizing cellulitis, necrotizing fasciitis, Fournier's gangrene, and necrotizing myositis. They are life-threatening, invasive soft tissue infections caused by aggressive, usually gas-forming bacteria. Delays in diagnosing and treating these infections increase the risk of mortality.

NSTIs may involve dermal and subcutaneous components (necrotizing cellulitis), fascial components (necrotizing fasciitis), and muscular components (necrotizing myositis) either singularly or in combination. NSTIs may also be classified into three types based on bacterial pathogens and their clinical characteristics:

- **Type 1**: Poly-microbial infections.
- **Type 2**: Mono-microbial infections caused by β-haemolytic streptococci or CA-MRSA.
- **Type 3**: Mono-microbial infections secondary to various pathogenic bacilli.

In the early phases, necrotizing soft tissue infections cause localized inflammatory reactions in the involved tissues. Necrosis occurs due to direct cellular injury from bacterial endo/exotoxins, significant inflammatory edema within a closed tissue compartment, thrombosis of local blood vessels, and tissue ischemia. Circulating toxins can cause systemic illness, progressing to septic shock, multisystem organ dysfunction, and death.

Patients with NSTIs caused by either Staphylococcus aureus or group A Streptococcus (Streptococcus pyogenes) may develop toxic shock syndrome (TSS). TSS is a toxin-mediated acute life-threatening illness where the systemically absorbed toxins act as superantigens, massively activating the immune system.

### Necrotizing fasciitis: Literature review of contemporary strategies for diagnosing and management with three case reports: Torso, abdominal wall, upper and lower limbs [^115SfjDj]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Today, the generally agreed-upon algorithm for care is as follows:

1. **Resuscitate the patient in shock**: Initiate broad-spectrum antibiotics which cover polymicrobial infection.

2. **Take the patient to the operating room for early comprehensive debridement of all dead tissue**: Doubt as to the diagnosis can be settled using frozen section histologic analysis. Obtain gram stain and culture from the wound.

3. **Further debridements**: These should be repeated every 24 to 48 hours until the infection is controlled.

4. **Antibiotic therapy**: Adjust this therapy to adequately cover organisms obtained on initial culture.

5. **Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO)**: Consider HBO in the hemodynamically stable patient, if available.

A combination of antibiotics is the key to successful adjuvant therapy, as most of our patients were treated with empirical antimicrobial therapy before we established the early diagnosis of the necrotizing infection. In the majority of our cases, the wound cultures were collected at the time of initial surgery. Unfortunately, antibiotic therapy alone has little value because tissue hypoxia and ischemia do not permit adequate delivery of antibiotics to the target tissue. The polymicrobial infection identified by wound cultures was the dominant cause of necrotizing fasciitis in our study. For that purpose, we used a combination of antibiotics that cover a broad spectrum of anaerobes, including clindamycin, and aerobes, gram-positive such as penicillin G or extended-spectrum penicillin, imipenem, and teicoplanin, and gram-negative organisms, including aminoglycosides, cephalosporins, or carbapenems. Our therapeutic regimen usually consisted of…

### Necrotizing fasciitis: eight-year experience and literature review [^113JhHTD]. The Brazilian Journal of Infectious Diseases (2013). High credibility.

Necrotizing fasciitis is a disease that can be associated with a variety of conditions and symptoms. These include peripheral artery disease (PAD), diarrhea, skin blisters, pain, and skin ulceration. Patients may also experience renal failure, purplish skin discoloration, and inflammation. Findings might show skin puncture or injury, increased blood glucose, decreased serum sodium, increased serum CRP, and altered levels of consciousness.

Additionally, symptoms can include nausea, increased LRINEC score, decreased body temperature, and diabetes mellitus. Other signs and conditions include skin discharge, skin crepitus, skin erythema, fever, cancer, skin warmth, and MRSA colonization. Exposure to salt water and an immunocompromised state can also be contributing factors.

Patients may exhibit dizziness, increased WBC count, liver cirrhosis, increased serum CK, skin tenderness, and fatigue. Other clinical features are skin induration, shock, hypersensitive skin, and hemorrhagic bullae.

### Successful use of posaconazole in a pediatric case of fungal necrotizing fasciitis [^111yTLCL]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

To report a pediatric case of posttraumatic fungal fasciitis treated successfully with a combination including posaconazole, a case report was conducted in the pediatric critical care unit at Antwerp University Hospital.

- **Patient**: A 12-year-old female polytrauma patient, suffering from extensive skin and muscle injuries, developed fasciitis. Two fungi, Mucor and Trichosporon species, were isolated. The necrotic tissues were aggressively excised, hyperbaric oxygen therapy was applied, and oral posaconazole was added to the initial amphotericin B treatment. The patient made an excellent recovery.

- **Conclusions**: A combination of a high index of suspicion, early aggressive surgery, hyperbaric oxygen, and the association of amphotericin B and posaconazole led to a successful outcome in a case of fungal necrotizing fasciitis. After decades of disappointing amphotericin B treatment in spite of acceptable in vitro activity, the combination with the new triazole posaconazole seems promising.

### World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) guidelines for management of skin and soft tissue infections [^112vEQE9]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) encompass a variety of pathological conditions ranging from simple superficial infections to severe necrotizing soft tissue infections. Necrotizing soft tissue infections (NSTIs) are potentially life-threatening infections of any layer of the soft tissue compartment, associated with widespread necrosis and systemic toxicity. Successful management of NSTIs involves prompt recognition, timely surgical debridement or drainage, resuscitation, and appropriate antibiotic therapy.

A worldwide international panel of experts developed evidence-based guidelines for the management of soft tissue infections. The multifaceted nature of these infections has led to a collaboration among surgeons, intensive care, and infectious diseases specialists, who have shared these guidelines, implementing clinical practice recommendations.

### Interventions for necrotizing soft tissue infections in adults [^1171YDpW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). High credibility.

Necrotizing soft tissue infections (NSTIs) are severe and rapidly spreading soft tissue infections of the subcutaneous tissue, fascia, or muscle, which are mostly caused by bacteria. Associated rates of mortality and morbidity are high, with the former estimated at around 23%, and disability, sequelae, and limb loss occurring in 15% of patients. Standard management includes intravenous empiric antimicrobial therapy, early surgical debridement of necrotic tissues, intensive care support, and adjuvant therapies such as intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG).

The objective of this review is to assess the effects of medical and surgical treatments for necrotizing soft tissue infections (NSTIs) in adults in hospital settings.

- **Search methods**: We searched the following databases up to April 2018: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS. Additional searches were conducted in five trial registers, pharmaceutical company trial results databases, and the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency websites. We also checked the reference lists of included studies and reviews for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs).

- **Selection criteria**: RCTs conducted in hospital settings that evaluated any medical or surgical treatment for adults with NSTI were eligible for inclusion. Eligible medical treatments included comparisons between different antimicrobials or with placebo; adjuvant therapies such as intravenous immunoglobulin (IGIV) therapy compared with placebo; no treatment; or other adjuvant therapies. Eligible surgical treatments were also considered.

### World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) guidelines for management of skin and soft tissue infections [^116tptRu]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Necrotizing fasciitis is a necrotizing soft tissue infection (NSTI) involving the fascial planes overlying the muscle. Due to the tenuous blood and lymphatic supply of the fascia and the potential planes on either surface, infectious processes can spread rapidly and relatively unimpeded once initiated. Thus, necrotizing fasciitis comprises a spectrum of diseases characterized by extensive, rapidly progressive necrosis involving the fascia and peri-fascial planes. It may secondarily involve the surrounding subcutaneous tissue, skin, and muscle.

This condition is most often poly-microbial and synergistic in nature, with the specific bacteria involved being related to the etiologic source or body region of origin. Necrotizing fasciitis can involve any part of the body but primarily affects the extremities, abdomen, or perineum. Anaya et al, in a study of 150 cases of necrotizing fasciitis, reported that extremities were the most common site of infection (58%), followed by the abdomen and perineum.

Usually, necrotizing fasciitis is precipitated by some form of injury or local pathological condition: blunt or penetrating trauma, surgical site infection, burns, ulcers, abscesses, and even childbirth have been documented as precipitating factors for necrotizing fasciitis. Improperly treated superficial infections can progress to necrotizing fasciitis. Body piercing procedures and tattooing, very minor trauma such as abrasion and insect bites, have also been found to initiate necrotizing fasciitis. In some situations, necrotizing fasciitis has arisen without an identifiable previous trauma or pathological condition.

The mortality associated with the disease is high and has been reported from 6% to as high as 76%.

### Inpefa [^111adEkF]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum (Fournier's gangrene)**: Reports of necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum, a rare but serious and life-threatening necrotizing infection requiring urgent surgical intervention, have been identified in postmarketing surveillance in patients with diabetes mellitus receiving SGLT2 inhibitors. Cases have been reported in both females and males. Serious outcomes have included hospitalization, multiple surgeries, and death. Patients treated with Inpefa presenting with pain, tenderness, erythema, or swelling in the genital or perineal area, along with fever or malaise, should be assessed for necrotizing fasciitis. If suspected, start treatment immediately with broad-spectrum antibiotics and, if necessary, surgical debridement. Discontinue Inpefa, closely monitor blood glucose levels, and provide appropriate alternative therapy for heart failure.

- **Genital mycotic infections**: Inpefa increases the risk of genital mycotic infections. Patients with a history of genital mycotic infections were more likely to develop these infections [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Monitor and treat appropriately.

- **Positive urine glucose test**: Monitoring glucose levels with urine glucose tests is not recommended as SGLT2 inhibition increases urinary glucose excretion and will lead to positive urine glucose tests. Use alternative methods to monitor glucose levels.

- **Interference with 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG) assay**: Monitoring glucose levels with the 1,5-AG assay is not recommended as measurements of 1,5-AG are unreliable.

### Approaches to surgical debridement in necrotizing soft tissue infections: Outcomes of an animated, interactive survey [^112HnqFa]. World Journal of Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

Necrotizing soft-tissue infections (NSTIs) are severe bacterial infections characterized by rapid tissue destruction and systemic toxicity. These include subtypes based on tissue layers (necrotizing fasciitis, necrotizing myositis, necrotizing cellulitis) and on anatomic region (Fournier gangrene, Ludwig's angina). Due to improved disease management, the mortality rate has decreased from an average of 28.5% in the late nineteenth century to 19.7% more recently. Consequently, there is a need to focus on the long-term effects of this disease. The previously described decreased health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in survivors of NSTI is expected to be at least partially explained by scars and scar-related issues, such as pain, itch, contractures, and aesthetic concerns. Therefore, limiting scar size and improving scar quality are anticipated to enhance long-term outcomes.

One factor that may influence the final scar size could be the approach used for surgical debridement of NSTI in the acute phase. Historically, en bloc debridement has been employed, where all skin above the affected fascia is resected. This method provides effective source control but leads to extensive skin defects. Recently, a skin-sparing approach to debridement has been proposed. This method preserves all potentially viable skin above the affected fascia to decrease the final scar size and scar-related problems such as contractures, pain, and appearance. Although there is currently no convincing evidence for the superiority of either approach, the skin-sparing approach has been adapted as the pr
