## Question

Toxic effects of methotrexate

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the toxic effects of methotrexate, including dose context, organ-specific toxicities, mechanisms, risk factors, prevention, and management strategies across low- and high-dose use cases. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical dosing spectrum and why toxicity scales with dose and clearance. Then, I should verify the major organ systems affected and quantify key risks where data exist. Next, I will review patient- and drug-specific risk factors and mechanistic pathways that tie the clinical syndromes together. After that, I should outline prevention strategies for high-dose regimens and for low-dose use in immune-mediated diseases. Finally, I need to detail acute management, special populations, and safety monitoring considerations, making sure each step is internally consistent and supported by data before I move on [^111nUVrz] [^1168K4a1].

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and dose spectrum, because toxicity is dose- and clearance-dependent. Low-dose methotrexate is typically ≤ 30 mg weekly for inflammatory diseases, whereas high-dose methotrexate is generally ≥ 500 mg/m² for oncologic indications, and these high exposures mandate structured supportive care with hydration, urinary alkalinization, and leucovorin rescue to mitigate predictable toxicities from delayed clearance and crystalluria [^111nUVrz] [^113m53Uq].

> I will now examine hematologic toxicity, since myelosuppression is both common and life-threatening if unrecognized. Methotrexate suppresses hematopoiesis and can cause severe pancytopenia and its complications; this is explicitly highlighted in the prescribing information and is a major reason for routine blood count monitoring and dose holds with cytopenias, and in overdose or impaired elimination settings risk escalates sharply due to prolonged exposure [^113zEAzb] [^111nUVrz]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; low-dose regimens can still produce severe marrow suppression in the presence of risk factors such as renal dysfunction or interacting drugs, and clusters of psoriasis overdoses underscore that cytopenias and fatal outcomes can occur despite folinic acid if recognition is delayed, so vigilance and early rescue matter [^114herW9] [^113K8udg].

> Next, I should review hepatotoxicity to separate acute enzyme elevations from chronic structural injury. Wait, let me verify the contemporary view: while transaminase elevations are not uncommon, chronic progressive liver disease is less frequent than historically assumed when folate is supplemented and comorbid NAFLD is accounted for; patients with NAFLD appear to have higher risk and warrant tailored screening and non-invasive fibrosis assessment in long-term therapy [^111GBAwd] [^113fA4Bc]. I need to ensure the evidence aligns: randomized low-dose data confirm more hepatic laboratory events than placebo but with manageable severity under folate supplementation, which supports routine monitoring rather than reflex discontinuation for mild, transient elevations [^111GBAwd].

> I will now analyze renal toxicity, because impaired clearance is the pivot for multi-system injury in high-dose settings. Methotrexate and its metabolites can precipitate in the renal tubules, causing acute kidney injury, delayed elimination, and a vicious cycle of rising exposure that amplifies mucositis and marrow suppression; incidence of AKI after high-dose infusions ranges from 2% to 12% in oncology series and is mitigated by alkalinized hydration and timely leucovorin rescue [^111nUVrz]. Let me first confirm consensus definitions: in pediatric ALL, the PTWG defines delayed methotrexate elimination as creatinine rise > 0.3 mg/dL or 1.5-fold plus markedly elevated plasma methotrexate thresholds at 36, 42, and 48 hours after infusion start (> 20, > 10, and > 5 μM, respectively), and this state often begins without symptoms, emphasizing the role of protocolized level monitoring [^114YiBUF].

> Now I need to check neurotoxicity patterns, distinguishing acute stroke-like presentations from subacute leukoencephalopathy and longer-term deficits. Stroke-like syndrome typically occurs within three weeks of systemic or intrathecal dosing and presents with focal deficits or seizures, with diffusion MRI showing cytotoxic edema; mechanistically, folate pathway disruption and homocysteine-mediated NMDA receptor activation are implicated, and labels warn that neurotoxicity can be progressive and irreversible, especially after cranial radiation [^114wg9Cc] [^113A4LNh]. But wait, what if the patient appears to recover quickly; even then, I should confirm long-term risks because pediatric cohorts with on-therapy neurotoxic events show worse fine motor and attention performance at approximately four years, arguing for early neuropsychological surveillance and targeted support after an event [^1115ZpZE].

> Let me consider mucocutaneous toxicity carefully, because it often heralds systemic exposure problems. High-dose courses in very young children frequently produce clinically significant mucositis, and characteristic low-dose toxicity can present with painful ulceration of plaques in psoriasis and histologic dystrophic keratinocytes even when routine labs are initially unremarkable, which should prompt methotrexate cessation and evaluation for dosing errors or renal impairment before catastrophic marrow events occur [^1149nnKS] [^114zUdrc]. I should double-check for atypical skin necrosis presentations; lower-extremity blistering and necrosis and even epidermal necrosis have been reported, and while leucovorin is rational, evidence of benefit in cutaneous necrosis is limited, so supportive wound care and drug discontinuation are priorities [^115JxjiJ] [^111Bbfud].

> Next, I should review pulmonary toxicity while avoiding overattribution. Interstitial lung disease has been linked to methotrexate in observational RA populations, though distinguishing drug-related ILD from RA lung disease is challenging; randomized data more clearly show increased infectious respiratory complications with low-dose methotrexate, which reminds me to screen for infection risk and maintain diagnostic humility for noninfectious pneumonitis versus alternative etiologies [^116qAeuu] [^111GBAwd]. Hold on, I should verify that guidance reflects this uncertainty; labels and monitoring recommendations emphasize vigilance for pulmonary symptoms without asserting high rates of noninfectious events in controlled settings, which aligns with a cautious but evidence-aware posture [^1168K4a1].

> I will now examine gastrointestinal toxicity and conditioned intolerance, since these often drive discontinuation. Low-dose randomized data show higher risks of gastrointestinal adverse events versus placebo despite folate, and pediatric cohorts demonstrate anticipatory and associative intolerance phenomena around dosing that are not strictly dose-route dependent, indicating that behavioral and supportive strategies can be as important as pharmacologic adjustments for adherence [^111GBAwd] [^1146xsfb]. Wait, let me reconsider attributions; intolerance can coexist with mild lab toxicities, so I should confirm labs before attributing symptoms solely to conditioning to avoid missing emergent hepatotoxicity or cytopenias [^1151uQA6].

> I need to check key risk factors that amplify toxicity across doses so I can stratify patients. Renal dysfunction, older age, underlying liver disease including NAFLD, third-space fluid collections, and Down syndrome biology all heighten risk by impairing clearance, altering folate homeostasis, or prolonging exposure, and they justify dose reduction, slower escalation, and closer monitoring from the outset [^111nUVrz] [^114Jqzmk] [^113fA4Bc] [^116WFoCt] [^117Fwbrb]. Hold on, I should verify pharmacogenetic contributors; variants in transporters such as SLCO1B1 and ABCC1 and folate-pathway genes have been associated with higher plasma levels and clinical toxicity in ALL and psoriasis cohorts, although replication is variable, so I will treat these as risk signals rather than deterministic tests in routine care [^111pL3P1] [^1175Sp7R] [^116ur4Bs] [^114XLsqd].

> Let me first confirm the major drug–drug interactions that magnify exposure or marrow toxicity. Concomitant trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, frequent NSAIDs or salicylates, and potentially proton pump inhibitors can raise methotrexate levels or synergize antifolate effects and precipitate cytopenias; equally important, calendar errors substituting daily for weekly dosing are repeatedly fatal, so explicit counseling and dispensing safeguards are essential [^113F4VZe] [^111NRLNU] [^115YkzvS] [^113K8udg]. I need to ensure prescribing systems flag daily orders, and I should double-check patient education at each visit to reduce these preventable events [^111pJM6P].

> I will now explain mechanisms to connect pathophysiology with clinical syndromes. Primary toxicity derives from dihydrofolate reductase inhibition, leading to tetrahydrofolate depletion and impaired nucleotide synthesis in rapidly dividing tissues such as marrow and mucosa, while secondary mechanisms include renal tubular crystallization with obstructive AKI and homocysteine-mediated endothelial injury and NMDA receptor excitotoxicity in the CNS, which together explain the clustering of mucositis, myelosuppression, nephrotoxicity, and neurotoxicity in delayed-clearance states [^114wg9Cc] [^111nUVrz]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost overlooked that intracellular polyglutamation extends effective half-life in tissues even when serum levels fall, which helps explain persistent marrow suppression after apparent plasma clearance in case reports, reinforcing the need for ongoing rescue until clinical recovery [^1123Wjk6].

> Next, I should review prevention for high-dose regimens, because proactive supportive care is the cornerstone of safe delivery. Protocolized prehydration, urine alkalinization to maintain pH ≥ 7, and pharmacokinetically guided leucovorin rescue starting about 24 hours after infusion, with serial methotrexate level monitoring at prespecified time points and dose-adjusted rescue based on concentrations, reduce AKI and downstream toxicities and are recommended in labels and oncology guidance [^111nUVrz] [^116rbgAg] [^113R1muN] [^113m53Uq]. I should confirm timing nuances; delays beyond 36–42 hours increase toxicity in pediatric analyses, so when in doubt, I will err on the side of timely or intensified rescue rather than waiting for levels if clinical or laboratory signals of delayed elimination appear [^111k3v5N] [^114YiBUF].

> For low-dose methotrexate in immune-mediated diseases, I need to ensure foundational safety practices are explicit. Weekly, never daily, dosing with clear labeling, universal folate supplementation, baseline assessment of renal and hepatic function and alcohol use, and review of interacting medications reduce gastrointestinal and hepatic events and prevent catastrophic dosing errors; splitting the weekly dose or switching to parenteral administration can help with intolerance without necessarily increasing toxicity [^111NRLNU] [^111GBAwd] [^112Dzxwb] [^1151uQA6]. Hold on, I should verify contraceptive guidance; labels require effective contraception during treatment and for months afterward due to embryo-fetal toxicity, and I need to counsel both females and males accordingly [^113zEAzb] [^116WFoCt].

> I will now outline management once toxicity is established, keeping priorities in order. Immediate cessation of methotrexate, aggressive IV hydration with urinary alkalinization, and leucovorin rescue titrated to methotrexate levels are first-line, with escalation to high-dose leucovorin and consideration of glucarpidase if there is delayed elimination with AKI; most patients recover renal function without dialysis if rescue is early and sustained until methotrexate concentrations fall below 0.05 μM and organ function improves [^116rbgAg] [^111nUVrz] [^111h9hwd]. I should double-check neurotoxicity adjuncts; case series support dextromethorphan or aminophylline as NMDA and adenosine pathway modulators for subacute CNS events, though spontaneous recovery is common and re-challenge may be feasible with caution, while severe cutaneous necrosis requires drug withdrawal and supportive wound care with uncertain benefit from leucovorin beyond systemic rescue [^1156jbo2] [^112XKc9n] [^111Bbfud].

> Finally, I need to ensure special populations and monitoring frameworks are explicit so that risk is not underestimated. Older adults receiving high-dose regimens have higher rates of grade ≥ 3 toxicities and often require dose adjustments based on contemporaneous GFR calculations, pediatric ALL protocols define delayed elimination thresholds and often see the highest risk with the first high-dose exposure, and patients with Down syndrome may have altered folate homeostasis that heightens toxicity, all of which argue for individualized dosing and intensified monitoring during early cycles and when clinical status changes [^114Jqzmk] [^114YiBUF] [^117Fwbrb]. Hold on, I should verify third-space considerations; ascites or pleural effusions prolong methotrexate half-life and can precipitate late toxicity, so I will drain when feasible and prolong monitoring and rescue if not, maintaining a low threshold for additional leucovorin until levels and clinical status are reassuring [^116WFoCt] [^116rbgAg].

Methotrexate toxicity is **dose- and clearance-dependent** [^111nUVrz] and can be **life-threatening**, particularly with **high-dose therapy** or impaired renal function [^1168K4a1]. The most serious complications include **myelosuppression and mucositis** (often early warning signs), **nephrotoxicity from crystalluria**, and **neurotoxicity** (including stroke-like syndromes and leukoencephalopathy) [^111nUVrz] [^114wg9Cc]. Risk increases with renal impairment, drug interactions (notably NSAIDs and TMP-SMX), and dosing errors [^111nUVrz] [^113F4VZe] [^113K8udg]. Management focuses on immediate drug cessation, aggressive hydration with urinary alkalinization [^111nUVrz], and timely **leucovorin rescue** [^111h9hwd], while **glucarpidase** is indicated for delayed clearance or renal failure, and hemodialysis is reserved for refractory cases [^111nUVrz]. Prevention requires careful patient selection, **folate supplementation** [^112Dzxwb], and **strict monitoring** of renal function, blood counts, and methotrexate levels [^1131w6BR] [^111NRLNU] [^111nUVrz].

## Clinical manifestations of methotrexate toxicity

Methotrexate toxicity has a broad spectrum of **clinical manifestations**, including:

- **Hematologic toxicity**: Myelosuppression, pancytopenia, anemia, leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased infection risk [^113zEAzb] [^1168K4a1] [^111nUVrz].

- **Gastrointestinal toxicity**: Mucositis, stomatitis, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and mucosal ulcerations [^1151uQA6] [^111GBAwd] [^111nUVrz].

- **Hepatotoxicity**: Elevated transaminases, hepatic fibrosis, and cirrhosis [^111nUVrz] [^113fA4Bc].

- **Renal toxicity**: Acute kidney injury (AKI) due to methotrexate crystallization in renal tubules, leading to impaired clearance and prolonged exposure [^111nUVrz] [^114YiBUF].

- **Pulmonary toxicity**: Interstitial pneumonitis and pulmonary fibrosis [^116qAeuu] [^111nUVrz].

- **Neurotoxicity**: Acute stroke-like syndromes, subacute leukoencephalopathy, and chronic cognitive impairment [^114wg9Cc] [^1115ZpZE] [^113A4LNh].

- **Dermatologic toxicity**: Skin ulcerations, epidermal necrosis, and severe cutaneous reactions [^114zUdrc] [^111Bbfud].

---

## Risk factors for methotrexate toxicity

Several factors **increase the risk** of methotrexate toxicity, including:

- **Renal impairment**: Reduced renal function significantly increases toxicity risk due to impaired methotrexate clearance [^111nUVrz] [^114YiBUF].

- **Drug interactions**: Concomitant use of NSAIDs, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and other nephrotoxic drugs increases toxicity risk [^111NRLNU] [^113F4VZe] [^111nUVrz].

- **Dosing errors**: Accidental overdose or incorrect dosing frequency can lead to severe toxicity [^113K8udg] [^114herW9] [^115YkzvS].

- **Genetic predisposition**: Polymorphisms in genes involved in methotrexate metabolism and transport (e.g. SLCO1B1, MTHFR) influence toxicity risk [^111pL3P1] [^1175Sp7R] [^114XLsqd].

- **Patient-specific factors**: Advanced age, obesity, and pre-existing liver disease increase toxicity risk [^111nUVrz] [^116E3TSB] [^114Jqzmk].

---

## Management strategies for methotrexate toxicity

Effective management involves several **key interventions**:

- **Immediate cessation of methotrexate**: Discontinue methotrexate immediately upon suspicion of toxicity [^1168K4a1].

- **Leucovorin rescue therapy**: Administer leucovorin calcium to counteract methotrexate's antifolate effects [^111h9hwd]. Standard dosing is 15 mg every 6 hours, starting 24 hours after methotrexate infusion, continued until methotrexate levels fall below 0.05 micromolar [^111k3v5N] [^116rbgAg].

- **Hydration and urinary alkalinization**: Aggressive intravenous hydration [^111nUVrz] and urinary alkalinization (urine pH ≥ 7.0) to enhance methotrexate elimination and prevent renal crystallization [^113m53Uq] [^113R1muN].

- **Glucarpidase administration**: Use glucarpidase in cases of delayed methotrexate clearance or renal failure to rapidly reduce methotrexate levels [^111nUVrz] [^113m53Uq].

- **Supportive care**: Manage complications such as myelosuppression, mucositis, and infections with appropriate supportive measures, including granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and antibiotics [^113zEAzb].

---

## Preventive measures and monitoring protocols

Prevention of methotrexate toxicity requires **careful patient selection**, **folate supplementation**, regular monitoring, and patient education [^1131w6BR]. Assess renal and hepatic function, and avoid methotrexate in patients with significant renal impairment or liver disease [^111NRLNU] [^1168K4a1]. Routine **folic acid supplementation** (1 mg/day) reduces gastrointestinal and hepatic toxicity without compromising efficacy [^112Dzxwb] [^1151uQA6]. **Regular monitoring** of renal function, liver enzymes, complete blood counts, and methotrexate levels is required throughout therapy [^111nUVrz] [^111NRLNU]. Patients should be educated about proper dosing, potential side effects, and the importance of adhering to monitoring protocols [^111pJM6P].

---

Methotrexate toxicity is a **significant clinical concern**, encompassing hematologic, gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, pulmonary, neurologic, and dermatologic effects. Management involves **immediate cessation** of methotrexate, leucovorin rescue, hydration with urinary alkalinization, and supportive care. Prevention requires careful patient selection, **folate supplementation**, regular monitoring, and patient education.

### Methotrexate drug interactions in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis: a systematic review [^113F4VZe]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) often have comorbidities that require multiple medications. Several of these medications may alter the efficacy or increase the toxicity of methotrexate (MTX). The purpose of our study was to determine which drugs used in combination with MTX (excluding disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, folic and folinic acid, corticosteroids, and biologic agents) enhance the side effects or toxicity of MTX or lower its efficacy.

- **Methods**: A systematic literature search was performed with Medline, Embase, Cochrane Register and Database, and abstracts from the 2006/2007 annual congresses of the American College of Rheumatology and the European League Against Rheumatism. A manual search of the citation lists of retrieved publications was also conducted.

- **Results**: Of the 1172 articles identified, 67 were included: 21 pharmacokinetics studies, 5 observational studies, and 78 case reports. Most medications do not significantly affect the pharmacokinetic profile of MTX. Among the clinical studies, cytopenia and elevation of liver enzymes were the main reported toxicities. The use of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) was mentioned as a risk factor for developing cytopenia in one observational study and in 17 case reports. Thirty case reports of cytopenia were attributed to the use of concomitant nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including acetylsalicylic acid. Two studies described mild abnormalities of liver enzymes with the use of isoniazid, and one study with the use of high-dose ASA.

Based on the published literature, methotrexate has significant interactions with certain medications, which can lead to increased toxicity or altered efficacy.

### Acute therapy-related toxicities in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia [^114wg9Cc]. Haematologica (2025). Low credibility.

Methotrexate-induced stroke-like syndrome is a significant complication of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) therapy. Clinical manifestations typically include the sudden onset of neurological symptoms such as hemiparesis, aphasia, seizures, and altered mental status. The condition is termed "stroke-like" due to its resemblance to ischemic stroke. The onset of stroke-like syndrome (SLS) usually occurs within three weeks after systemic or intrathecal methotrexate (MTX) administration. Magnetic resonance imaging findings, particularly diffusion-weighted imaging, have been instrumental in identifying characteristic changes, such as focal or diffuse hyperintensity of the periventricular or subcortical white matter on T2-weighted images. Restricted diffusion on the apparent diffusion coefficient map suggests cytotoxic edema.

- **Pathogenesis**: The pathogenesis of MTX-induced SLS is not entirely understood, but it is thought to involve direct neurotoxic effects on the central nervous system (CNS). Several mechanisms have been suggested. MTX acts by inhibiting dihydrofolate reductase, which decreases tetrahydrofolate, a key factor in DNA synthesis and repair. This depletion may result in neurotoxicity, especially in rapidly dividing cells within the CNS. Elevated homocysteine levels may cause direct damage to the vascular endothelium. Moreover, homocysteine metabolites are also excitatory agonists of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, and excessive activation of this receptor has been linked to neurotoxicity and seizure activity.

### Preventing and managing toxicities of high-dose methotrexate [^111nUVrz]. The Oncologist (2016). Low credibility.

High-dose methotrexate (HDMTX), defined as a dose higher than 500 mg/m², is used to treat a range of adult and childhood cancers. Although HDMTX is safely administered to most patients, it can cause significant toxicity, including acute kidney injury (AKI) in 2%-12% of patients. Nephrotoxicity results from the crystallization of methotrexate in the renal tubular lumen, leading to tubular toxicity. AKI and other toxicities of high-dose methotrexate can lead to significant morbidity, treatment delays, and diminished renal function.

Risk factors for methotrexate-associated toxicity include a history of renal dysfunction, volume depletion, acidic urine, and drug interactions. Renal toxicity leads to impaired methotrexate clearance and prolonged exposure to toxic concentrations, which further worsen renal function and exacerbate nonrenal adverse events, including myelosuppression, mucositis, dermatologic toxicity, and hepatotoxicity.

Serum creatinine, urine output, and serum methotrexate concentration are monitored to assess renal clearance. Measures such as hydration, urinary alkalinization, and leucovorin rescue are used to prevent and mitigate AKI and subsequent toxicity. When delayed methotrexate excretion or AKI occurs despite preventive strategies, increased hydration, high-dose leucovorin, and glucarpidase are usually sufficient to allow renal recovery without the need for dialysis. Prompt recognition and effective treatment of AKI and associated toxicities mitigate further toxicity, facilitate renal recovery, and permit patients to receive other chemotherapy or resume HDMTX therapy.

### A family physician's guide to monitoring methotrexate [^111NRLNU]. American Family Physician (2000). Low credibility.

Methotrexate has a long history of use in the treatment of various immunologic diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. Although the drug is usually prescribed by a subspecialist, a family physician may assume responsibility for monitoring methotrexate therapy. Major toxic effects, such as hepatic, pulmonary, renal, and bone marrow abnormalities, require careful monitoring. Minor toxic effects, such as stomatitis, malaise, nausea, diarrhea, headaches, and mild alopecia, are common but respond to folate supplementation.

Methotrexate is administered once weekly as a single dose or in divided doses given over a 24-hour period. To reduce the incidence of major toxic effects, methotrexate should never be given in daily doses. Relative contraindications include renal dysfunction, liver disease, active infectious disease, and excessive alcohol consumption. Both women and men of reproductive age should use birth control during methotrexate therapy. Potential drug interactions include salicylates and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which are both commonly used in patients with rheumatoid arthritis or psoriasis. A pre-methotrexate evaluation is important to ensure proper patient selection for this effective but potentially toxic drug.

### Risk stratified monitoring for methotrexate toxicity in immune mediated inflammatory diseases: Prognostic model development and validation using primary care data from the UK [^1131w6BR]. BMJ (2023). High credibility.

In the United Kingdom, the initial prescription for methotrexate and dose escalation occurs in hospital outpatient clinics. During this period, hospital specialists organize the monitoring of blood tests and respond to abnormal results. Once a patient's treatment is established — that is, a stable, well-tolerated, and effective methotrexate dose is reached, typically about six months after the start of treatment — GPs take on the responsibility of prescribing for and monitoring patients with periodic blood tests according to NHS shared care protocols. During shared care prescribing, GPs seek advice about side effects from hospital specialists, including abnormal blood test results, and the hospital specialists direct changes to treatment.

Patients were followed up from 180 days after their first prescription for methotrexate in primary care to the earliest of the outcome, drug discontinuation for any reason, leaving the practice, last data collection from the practice, death, five years, or 31 December 2019.

The outcome of interest was methotrexate toxicity-associated drug discontinuation, defined as a prescription gap of ≥ 90 days with either an abnormal blood test result or a diagnostic code for an abnormal blood test result within ± 60 days of the last prescription date. The thresholds for abnormal blood test results were: total leucocyte count < 3.5×10^9/L, platelet count < 150×10^9/L, alanine aminotransferase > 100 IU/mL, and decline in kidney function, defined as.

### The pharmacogenetics of methotrexate [^114XLsqd]. Rheumatology (2007). Low credibility.

Methotrexate (MTX) is a cornerstone of therapy for rheumatoid arthritis. However, it is not universally effective, and up to one-third of patients fail to respond to treatment, either because of inefficacy or adverse events, although at present it is not possible to predict therapy response accurately. Pharmacogenetics is the study of variability in drug response due to heredity. MTX has a complex intracellular metabolism and acts via a number of key enzymes. This review critically appraises the studies of MTX pharmacogenetics and highlights the need for further work in this area.

### Deaths following methotrexate overdoses by medical staff [^115YkzvS]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2005). Low credibility.

Methotrexate (MTX) is an effective disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) with a relatively safe profile, widely used to treat neoplastic diseases and dermatologic and rheumatologic disorders. As indications for the use of MTX increase, more accidental overdoses are observed to occur. Typical problems include deficiencies in labeling, instructions, or packaging, as well as erroneous use. We describe five fatal cases of repeated oral overdose of MTX prescribed by physicians in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis to focus attention on the design of the underlying system and the organizational practices as sources of problems.

### Methotrexate toxicity in psoriasis-a multicentric retrospective study [^114herW9]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Low credibility.

Even today, methotrexate (MTX) remains the backbone of psoriasis management in dermatological practice. The widespread usage, as well as the over-the-counter availability of the drug in India, has led to frequent incidents of overdosing, resulting in toxicity. However, there is a lack of large-sized, comprehensive studies in the literature emphasizing the reasons behind drug toxicity, clinical manifestations, and various management aspects.

This study aims to evaluate risk factors, clinical features, and suggest the best management protocol based on our experience in the management of MTX toxicity. A multicentric, retrospective study was conducted, including all cases of psoriasis who were treated for MTX toxicity in the last 5 years. Complete information, including demographic details, drug history, detailed clinical evaluation, laboratory parameters, management protocol, and outcomes, were studied and analyzed.

A total of 21 patients with psoriasis and MTX toxicity were included, of which 20 had mucocutaneous ulcerations, and hematological abnormalities were found in 76% of patients. All cases were treated with folinic acid, and 85% of patients recovered within 7–14 days. Three out of 21 patients succumbed to their illness despite the best possible treatment.

Overdosing was found to be the most common cause (66%) of drug toxicity, either inadvertently or due to self-medication. Patients must be counseled regarding the course of the disease, drug regimen, and dreaded side effects prior to initiating the drug. If symptoms of toxicity appear, prompt medical advice must be sought.

### High-dose methotrexate toxicity in elderly patients with primary central nervous system lymphoma [^114Jqzmk]. Annals of Oncology (2005). Low credibility.

The dose of high-dose methotrexate (HDMTX) in elderly patients often has to be reduced, resulting in a loss of treatment efficacy. We evaluated HDMTX-related toxicity with special regard to age distribution in patients with primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) in a phase IV multicenter trial.

- **Patients and methods**: One hundred and fifty-four patients (median age 61 years; 89 patients > 60 years old, 21 patients > 70 years old) received 619 HDMTX cycles. Toxicity was evaluated prospectively using the WHO classification. Unless a reduced dose was required after calculating a decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR), the patients received 4 g/m(2) HDMTX followed by leucovorin rescue.

- **Results**: Toxicity was generally mild with toxicities of WHO grade ≥ 3 more frequently observed in patients aged > 60 years than in those ≤ 60 years old (18% versus 44%; P = 0.001).

- **Conclusions**: HDMTX is a safe treatment for PCNSL patients regardless of age, with adherence to dose reduction determined by calculating the GFR before each treatment cycle.

### Jylamvo [^113zEAzb]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Embryo-fetal toxicity**: Based on published reports and its mechanism of action, methotrexate can cause fetal harm, including fetal death, when administered to a pregnant woman. Jylamvo is contraindicated for use in pregnant women receiving Jylamvo for the treatment of non-malignant diseases. Advise pregnant women with neoplastic diseases of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Jylamvo and for 6 months after the final dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during Jylamvo treatment and for at least 3 months after the final dose [see Contraindications (4), Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)].

- **Hypersensitivity reactions**: Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, can occur with methotrexate [see Contraindications (4), Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. If anaphylaxis or other serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs, immediately and permanently discontinue Jylamvo [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

- **Myelosuppression**: Methotrexate suppresses hematopoiesis and can cause severe and life-threatening pancytopenia, anemia, leukopenia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Obtain blood counts at baseline, periodically during treatment, and as clinically indicated. Monitor patients for clinical complications of myelosuppression. Withhold, dose reduce, or discontinue Jylamvo taking into account the importance of Jylamvo treatment in the context of the severity of the disease being treated.

### Methotrexate toxicity from unintentional dosing errors: Calls to a poison center and death descriptions [^113K8udg]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Methotrexate is a folate analog prescribed for various diseases with weekly administration as opposed to daily. Dosing errors can prove clinically significant and sometimes fatal.

- **Methods**: We performed a retrospective poison center review of methotrexate calls between 2009 and 2019.

- **Results**: Of 111 human-related poison center calls, most patients taking methotrexate were women aged 41 to 80 years old and were prescribed methotrexate for rheumatoid arthritis. Eighty-eight (79%) were admitted to the hospital, and 41 (36%) of these patients received leukovorin treatment for their exposure. Two patients died from methotrexate dosing errors.

- **Discussion**: Most methotrexate accidental ingestions reported to poison centers result from dose frequency errors. However, we note a higher incidence of unintentional therapeutic errors (79% vs. 13.7%) than reported in the National Poison Data System in 2019. Patients are often hospitalized for lab monitoring, and many receive leucovorin.

- **Conclusions**: Most methotrexate calls to our poison center resulted from taking the drug more often than prescribed. Efforts may focus on patient education, physician or pharmacist monitoring during initiation, improved dispensing devices, or weekly drug dispensing.

### Episodes of acute methotrexate-related neurotoxicity linked to compromised long-term neurocognitive function [^1115ZpZE]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2024). High credibility.

Methotrexate is a critical component of curative chemotherapy for pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) but is associated with neurotoxicity. Information on long-term outcomes following an acute neurotoxic event is limited. Therefore, this report compares neurocognitive performance more than 12 months post-diagnosis (mean = 4 years) between ALL patients with (n = 25) and without (n = 146) a history of acute neurotoxicity. Compared to children with no documented on-treatment neurotoxic event, children who experienced a neurotoxic event during treatment exhibited poorer performance on measures of fine motor function (p = .02) and attention (p = .02). Children with ALL who experience acute neurotoxicity may be candidates for early neuropsychological screening and intervention.

### How long can folinic acid rescue be delayed after high-dose methotrexate without toxicity [^111k3v5N]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

To determine the optimal time for folinic acid rescue after methotrexate (MTX) treatment in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), we selected and evaluated relevant studies that included doses, rescue delay, and side effects. Rescue at 42–48 hours resulted in considerable toxicity, except when low doses of MTX were used (1 g/m²) or serum MTX levels remained consistently low at 24, 30, and 36 hours. Rescue initiated at 30–36 hours was found to be safe. In the absence of evidence that later rescue improves prognosis, we suggest that folinic acid rescue (105 mg/m²) be started no later than 36 hours from the start of MTX (5–6 g/m²).

### Nephrotoxicity due to intermediate-dose methotrexate without rescue in an obese adolescent with acute lymphoblastic leukemia [^116E3TSB]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2002). Low credibility.

Toxicity from intermediate-dose methotrexate (MTX) is unusual. A severely obese adolescent with acute lymphoblastic leukemia experienced significant, delayed nephrotoxicity from intermediate-dose MTX. Altered MTX disposition may occur as a consequence of other ingestions or conditions such as obesity. The use of radioisotope renography established the diagnosis and followed the resolution of the patient's MTX-induced nephrotoxicity.

### Acute therapy-related toxicities in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia [^114YiBUF]. Haematologica (2025). High credibility.

Methotrexate-related nephrotoxicity is a significant concern in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treatment.

- **Epidemiology and clinical manifestations**: One of the fundamental drugs included in most contemporary pediatric ALL treatment protocols is high-dose methotrexate (HDMTX; 1–5 g/m²), which has been proven to decrease central nervous system (CNS) relapse and improve overall survival (OS). Nevertheless, up to 4% of treated patients develop renal toxicity with severely delayed methotrexate elimination (DME). The risk of severe DME is highest with the first HDMTX infusion. The Ponte di Legno Toxicity Working Group (PTWG) has defined DME as an increase in plasma creatinine of > 0.3 mg/dL or 1.5-fold above baseline, together with severely elevated plasma methotrexate concentrations at specific time points after methotrexate initiation: 36 hours (hr) MTX > 20 μM/L, 42 hr MTX > 10 μM/L, 48 hr MTX > 5 μM/L. DME may lead to cessation of HDMTX therapy and thus may impede the efficacy of treatment and increase the relapse rate. Some patients can be re-challenged with HDMTX, but no evidence-based guidelines for re-exposure exist. Additional symptoms, such as vomiting and diarrhea shortly after methotrexate administration, have been reported. However, most patients with DME are initially asymptomatic and present with non-oliguric renal dysfunction. An abrupt rise in serum creatinine during or shortly after MTX infusion implies the development of renal dysfunction, which can result in significantly elevated plasma methotrexate concentrations.

- **Pathogenesis**: Methotrexate enters the cell via the reduced folate carrier and undergoes polyglutamation, which retains it inside the cell. MTX blocks methionine, thymidine, purine, and pyrimidine synthesis by inhibiting dihydrofolate reductase.

Overall, awareness and close monitoring of methotrexate-related nephrotoxicity are crucial for managing potential adverse effects and optimizing treatment outcomes in pediatric patients with ALL.

### Busting the myth of methotrexate chronic hepatotoxicity [^113fA4Bc]. Nature Reviews Rheumatology (2023). High credibility.

Methotrexate is a key component of the treatment of inflammatory rheumatic diseases and the mainstay of therapy in rheumatoid arthritis. Hepatotoxicity has long been a concern for prescribers envisaging long-term treatment with methotrexate for their patients. However, the putative liver toxicity of methotrexate should be evaluated in the context of advances in our knowledge of the pathogenesis and natural history of liver disease, especially non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Notably, patients with NAFLD are at increased risk for methotrexate hepatotoxicity, and methotrexate can worsen the course of NAFLD.

Understanding the mechanisms of acute hepatotoxicity can facilitate the interpretation of elevated concentrations of liver enzymes in this context. Liver fibrosis and the mechanisms of fibrogenesis also need to be considered in relation to chronic exposure to methotrexate. A number of non-invasive tests for liver fibrosis are available for use in patients with rheumatic disease, in addition to liver biopsy, which can be appropriate for particular individuals. On the basis of the available evidence, practical suggestions for pretreatment screening and long-term monitoring of methotrexate therapy can be made for patients who have (or are at risk for) chronic liver disease.

### Leucovorin calcium [^116rbgAg]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The recommendations for leucovorin rescue are based on a methotrexate dose of 12 to 15 grams/m² administered by intravenous infusion over 4 hours (see methotrexate package insert for full prescribing information). Leucovorin rescue at a dose of 15 mg (approximately 10 mg/m²) every 6 hours for 10 doses starts 24 hours after the beginning of the methotrexate infusion. In the presence of gastrointestinal toxicity, nausea, or vomiting, leucovorin should be administered parenterally. Do not administer leucovorin intrathecally.

Serum creatinine and methotrexate levels should be determined at least once daily. Leucovorin administration, hydration, and urinary alkalization (pH of 7.0 or greater) should be continued until the methotrexate level is below 5 x 10⁻⁸ M (0.05 micromolar).

Patients who experience delayed early methotrexate elimination are likely to develop reversible renal failure. In addition to appropriate leucovorin therapy, these patients require continuing hydration and urinary alkalization, and close monitoring of fluid and electrolyte status, until the serum methotrexate level has fallen to below 0.05 micromolar and the renal failure has resolved.

Some patients will have abnormalities in methotrexate elimination or renal function following methotrexate administration, which are significant but less severe than aforementioned abnormalities. These abnormalities may or may not be associated with significant clinical toxicity. If significant clinical toxicity is observed, leucovorin rescue should be pursued.

### Adverse effects of low-dose methotrexate: A randomized trial [^111GBAwd]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Low-dose methotrexate (LD-MTX) is the most commonly used drug for systemic rheumatic diseases worldwide and is the recommended first-line agent for rheumatoid arthritis. Despite extensive clinical use for more than 30 years, few data on adverse event (AE) rates derive from randomized, placebo-controlled trials, where both causality and magnitude of risk can be inferred.

- **Objective**: To investigate AE rates, risk, and risk differences comparing LD-MTX versus placebo.

- **Design**: Prespecified secondary analyses of a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01594333).

- **Setting**: North America.

- **Participants**: Adults with known cardiovascular disease and diabetes or metabolic syndrome.

- **Intervention**: Random allocation to LD-MTX (≤ 20 mg/wk) or placebo. All participants received folic acid, 1 mg/d, 6 days per week.

- **Measurements**: Risks for specific AEs of interest, as well as for all AEs, were compared across treatment groups after blinded adjudication.

- **Results**: After an active run-in period, 6158 patients were enrolled and 4786 randomly assigned to a group; median follow-up was 23 months and median dosage 15 mg/wk. Among the randomly assigned participants, 81.2% were male, median age was 65.7 years, and median body mass index was 31.5 kg/m². Of 2391 participants assigned to LD-MTX, 2080 (87.0%) had an AE of interest, compared with 1951 of 2395 (81.5%) assigned to placebo (hazard ratio [HR], 1.17 [95% CI, 1.10 to 1.25]). The relative hazards of gastrointestinal (HR, 1.91 [CI, 1.75 to 2.10]) and pulmonary (HR, 1.52 [CI, 1.16 to 1.98]) infections were significant.

### Genetic variation in efflux transporters influences outcome to methotrexate therapy in patients with psoriasis [^1175Sp7R]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Methotrexate, an inexpensive first-line systemic therapy for moderate-to-severe psoriasis, is limited in its use by unpredictable efficacy and toxicity. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in methotrexate transmembrane transporters and adenosine receptors are associated with the efficacy and/or toxicity of the drug. DNA was collected from 374 patients with chronic plaque psoriasis who had been treated with methotrexate. Phenotypic data on efficacy and toxicity were available.

Haplotype tagging SNPs (r(2) > 0.8) across the relevant genes, with a minor allele frequency of > 5%, were selected from the HAPMAP phase II data. SNPs within the efflux transporter genes ABCC1 (ATP-binding cassette, subfamily C, member 1) and ABCG2 (ATP-binding cassette, subfamily G, member 2) are associated with a good response to methotrexate therapy in patients with psoriasis; the former gene was also associated with the onset of toxicity. With one SNP in ABCC1, rs246240, the carriage of two copies of allele 1 gives an odds ratio of 2.2 (95% confidence interval: 1.3–3.6; P = 0.001) for developing toxicity to methotrexate. These data indicate that knowledge of SNPs in genes relevant to methotrexate efflux may be important in selecting patients suitable for this therapy.

### Jylamvo [^113A4LNh]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Neurotoxicity**: Methotrexate can cause severe acute and chronic neurotoxicity, which can be progressive, irreversible, and fatal [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. The risk of leukoencephalopathy is increased in patients who received prior cranial radiation. Monitor patients for neurotoxicity and withhold or discontinue Jylamvo taking into account the importance of Jylamvo treatment in the context of the severity of the disease being treated, the severity of the adverse drug reaction, and availability of alternative therapy [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

- **Secondary malignancies**: Secondary malignancies can occur with methotrexate [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. The risk of cutaneous malignancies is further increased when cyclosporine is administered to patients with psoriasis who received prior methotrexate. In some cases, lymphoproliferative disease occurring during therapy with low-dose methotrexate regressed completely following withdrawal of methotrexate. If lymphoproliferative disease occurs, discontinue Jylamvo [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

- **Tumor lysis syndrome**: Methotrexate can induce tumor lysis syndrome in patients with rapidly growing tumors. Institute appropriate prophylactic measures in patients at risk for tumor lysis syndrome prior to initiation of Jylamvo.

- **Immunization and risks associated with live vaccines**: Disseminated infections following administration of live vaccines have been reported. Immunization with live vaccines is not recommended during treatment. Follow vaccination practice guidelines for administration.

### Reduced dose folinic acid rescue after rapid high-dose methotrexate clearance is not associated with increased toxicity in a pediatric cohort [^113R1muN]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2022). Low credibility.

High-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) treatment requires folinic acid (FA) rescue. The NOPHO ALL-2000 chemotherapy regimen included a total of eight courses of HD-MTX at 5 g/m² with intrathecal methotrexate (MTX) and FA rescue. Further details of the study protocol have been published elsewhere.

According to the protocol, 10% of the HD-MTX dose was administered during the first hour and the remaining 90% over the following 23 hours. Intrathecal MTX was given just before the MTX infusion in accordance with national practices. Intravenous hydration with 125 mL/m²/h, including 50 mmol/L of NaHCO₃, commenced at least 12 hours before the MTX infusion and continued until serum MTX (S-MTX) decreased to ≤ 0.2 μmol/L. If S-MTX was ≥ 3 μmol/L at 36 hours, intravenous hydration was increased to 4500 mL/m²/24 hours. Urine pH was measured at every voiding, and additional intravenous NaHCO₃ was administered if the pH was < 7.

S-MTX was monitored in all patients at 23, 36, 42, and 48 hours from the onset of the MTX infusion, and at least twice daily thereafter, until S-MTX levels reached ≤ 0.2 μmol/L. S-MTX levels were measured using a fluorescence polarization immunoassay.

FA rescue with leucovorin commenced 42 hours from the start of the MTX-infusion with a dose of 15 mg/m². Local guidelines recommended administering 15 mg/m² of FA 42 hours from the onset of the MTX infusion and every 6 hours thereafter until the plasma MTX concentration was ≤ 0.2 μmol/L. Although the guidelines related to HD-MTX courses given as part of the NOPHO ALL-2000 therapy generally recommended at least three doses of FA regardless of MTX clearance.

### Folate supplementation during methotrexate therapy for patients with psoriasis [^112Dzxwb]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Methotrexate is a folate antagonist that is a well-established therapy for autoimmune and inflammatory conditions. In some patients, methotrexate is associated with significant side effects and toxicity. Folate supplementation is often used to ameliorate methotrexate-associated side effects and toxicities. We sought to demonstrate that folate supplementation during methotrexate therapy reduces both toxicity and side effects without compromising efficacy.

A MEDLINE search of the terms "methotrexate", "folic acid", "folinic acid", and "leucovorin" was performed, and literature relevant to the use of folates as a supplement to methotrexate was reviewed. According to studies reviewed, the use of folate supplements in patients treated with methotrexate reduces the incidence of hepatotoxicity and gastrointestinal intolerance without impairing the efficacy of methotrexate. Both folic acid and folinic acid are equally effective; however, folic acid is more cost-effective. It must be noted that there are relatively few studies that have addressed folate supplementation with the use of methotrexate for the treatment of psoriasis. After examining the available data from the literature and drawing from clinical experience, we advise folate supplementation for every patient who receives methotrexate.

### Standardized supportive care documentation improves safety of high-dose methotrexate treatment [^113m53Uq]. The Oncologist (2021). Low credibility.

High-dose (HD) methotrexate (MTX; defined as MTX dose > 500 mg/m²) has been used for several decades as an important backbone in treatment protocols for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, osteosarcoma, and lymphoma [1, 2, 3]. MTX acts as a folate antimetabolite and inhibits DNA synthesis by blocking the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase. High doses of MTX are feasible by using folinic acid (also known as leucovorin, the reduced form of folic acid) to reduce the toxic effects on nonmalignant cells as a "leucovorin rescue".

Notable toxicities of HD-MTX include mucositis, myelosuppression, renal failure, liver injury, and neurotoxicity [4]. The risk of HD-MTX toxicity increases, particularly in cases of therapy-induced renal failure, because impaired renal function leads to reduced MTX renal clearance, which is the major route (90%) of MTX elimination [5]. Prolonged exposure to toxic MTX levels can induce severe myelosuppression and mucositis, becoming a life-threatening condition. Therefore, preventing renal injury and the associated risk of impaired MTX clearance is paramount to avoid MTX toxicity.

HD-MTX administration demands specialized supportive care to prevent adverse events. This includes strict urine alkalinization and hyperhydration to increase MTX elimination and prevent kidney damage, as well as the administration of leucovorin to reduce mucositis and myelosuppression [4, 6].

Urine alkalinization has been identified as a crucial aspect of MTX clearance and the prevention of renal toxicity. At a urine pH of 5, the solubility of MTX is very low, and it can precipitate, leading to potential complications.

### Methotrexate-induced epidermal necrosis following intrathecal chemotherapy: A case report [^111Bbfud]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

Prognosis and optimal management strategies differ between methotrexate-induced epidermal necrosis (MEN) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEC). As both conditions result from direct toxicity to keratinocytes, methotrexate should be stopped when a severe reaction is noted. Leucovorin rescue therapy has a theoretical benefit in patients with MEN by reducing further methotrexate-induced cell death. Chen et al. (2017) did not find a significant difference in mortality or recovery time between patients who received leucovorin and those who did not, but their case series was limited by a small sample size. Some patients in their case series were given systemic corticosteroids or granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, but the benefits concerning mortality or recovery time are unclear.

This case underscores the importance of considering MEN as a cause of skin necrosis after administration of methotrexate, even intrathecally. Diagnosing MEN is challenging due to the rarity of the condition. Additional reports are needed to better characterize MEN and determine optimal management strategies.

### The information required by people with inflammatory arthritis when taking methotrexate: a mixed-methods systematic review [^111pJM6P]. Rheumatology (2024). High credibility.

Concerns about taking MTX were expressed by many. Some were worried that MTX might not be helpful for inflammatory arthritis (IA) and sought information about possible risks, long-term harms, potential lifestyle restrictions such as the need to limit alcohol intake, and alternative treatment options.

Receiving verbal and written information around the time of diagnosis, which highlighted the need for care regarding the timing and dosage of MTX, requirements for monitoring blood tests, and possible side effects, heightened concerns for some. Others reported a pragmatic approach, balancing worries about MTX with optimism that side effects would not impact them. Satisfaction with information about side effects varied, with many seeking reassurance and more information, including the likelihood of experiencing side effects, to support decisions regarding starting MTX. Though some remained concerned about side effects, they decided to begin MTX treatment while seeking additional information.

Individuals with more concerns often used multiple information sources to resolve worries and gain reassurance about the necessity of taking MTX. Occasionally, using multiple sources resulted in conflicting information, which increased concerns and created a barrier to starting MTX. Some chose not to read 'official' information in an attempt to minimize concerns about side effects, while others rationalized their worries by accepting that all drugs have side effects. Information about alternative treatment options was important for those concerned that the risk of side effects might outweigh potential benefits.

### Polymorphisms of the SLCO1B1 gene predict methotrexate-related toxicity in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia [^111pL3P1]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2011). Low credibility.

Methotrexate (MTX) is an important component of therapy for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Treatment with high-dose MTX often causes toxicity, recommending a dose reduction and/or cessation of treatment. Polymorphisms in genes involved in MTX metabolism have been associated with toxicity, though results have been controversial. The discrepancies could be due to differences in treatment protocols among studies, small or non-homogeneous populations, or the use of different toxicity criteria. The aim of the present study was to analyze the possible correlation of polymorphisms of genes involved in MTX metabolism with toxicity during therapy using the well-established LAL/SHOP protocol.

- **Procedure**: We analyzed 10 polymorphisms in seven genes (MTHFR, TS, SHMT1, RFC1, ABCB1, ABCG2, and SLCO1B1) involved in MTX metabolism in 115 Spanish pediatric B-ALL patients, using MTX plasma concentration as an objective and quantifiable marker of toxicity.

- **Results**: We confirmed the suitability of MTX plasma levels as a toxicity marker. We found a statistically significant association between MTX plasma concentration and the SLCO1B1 rs11045879 CC genotype (P = 0.030). The rs4149081 AA genotype, in the same gene, could also be an indicator for high-MTX plasma concentrations. We did not find any significant association in the other genetic polymorphisms analyzed.

- **Conclusions**: Identification of the rs4149081 and rs11045879 SLCO1B1 polymorphisms in children with ALL could be a useful tool for monitoring patients at risk of low-MTX clearance in order to avoid MTX-related toxicities.

### Low-dose methotrexate-induced skin toxicity: Keratinocyte dystrophy as a histologic marker [^114zUdrc]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Skin toxicity during low-dose methotrexate therapy is rare, ill-described, and reported to have nonspecific histologic characteristics. Thus, misdiagnosis is common in patients with mucosal ulcers and/or skin erosions related to low-dose methotrexate.

- **Objective**: We sought to describe the features of skin toxicity induced by low-dose methotrexate.

- **Methods**: We evaluated the clinical and histologic features in 5 patients who experienced skin toxicity induced by low-dose methotrexate between 2011 and 2013.

- **Results**: All 5 patients had acute mucosal ulcers, 4 had moderately abnormal blood cell counts, and 3 had skin erosions. In 3 patients, methotrexate dosage or dosing schedule errors were identified. No other contributing factors (e.g. renal dysfunction or interacting drugs) were identified. Mucocutaneous biopsy specimens consistently showed multiple dystrophic keratinocytes.

- **Limitations**: We studied only 5 patients and obtained no sensitivity or specificity data on the diagnostic value of keratinocyte dystrophy.

- **Conclusion**: Keratinocyte dystrophy may help to diagnose skin toxicity of low-dose methotrexate, even in the absence of known risk factors or methotrexate administration errors. Studies of the diagnostic performance of this histologic sign are needed.

### Relative risk of and determinants for adverse events of methotrexate prescribed at a low dose: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized placebo-controlled trials [^1151uQA6]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2017). High credibility.

Low-dose methotrexate (i.e. ≤ 30 mg per week) is widely prescribed by dermatologists. However, there is limited evidence-based information regarding the relative risk of and determinants for adverse events associated with this treatment. The aims of this review were to assess the relative risk of and the determinants for adverse events associated with low-dose methotrexate exposure. A systematic review was undertaken using the MEDLINE, Embase, and CENTRAL databases. Randomized controlled trials comparing low-dose methotrexate with placebo were eligible.

Random effect meta-analyses were conducted to assess the risk ratios (RRs) of adverse events associated with methotrexate exposure. Subgroup analyses and random effect meta-regressions were performed to examine the determinants of adverse events. In total, 68 trials (6938 participants) were included. Compared with placebo, low-dose methotrexate slightly increased the risk of adverse events (mean number per individual: 1.78 ± 2.00 in the methotrexate group, 1.53 ± 1.89 in the placebo group; P < 0.001), including nausea/vomiting, elevated transaminase levels, mucosal ulcerations, leucopenia, thrombopenia, and infectious events, but not the risk of serious adverse events or death. Low-dose methotrexate also increased the number of withdrawals from studies because of adverse events [RR 1.32 (1.13–1.53)].

The concomitant prescription of folic/folinic acid was associated with a significantly lower risk of any adverse events, and methotrexate prescribed orally was associated with a higher risk of abdominal pain than when prescribed subcutaneously.

### Methotrexate use and risk of lung disease in psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and inflammatory bowel disease: Systematic literature review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^116qAeuu]. BMJ (2015). Low credibility.

Methotrexate is an effective treatment for malignant as well as several non-malignant inflammatory diseases. It is recommended as a first-line disease-modifying treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and psoriasis, and for both the induction and maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease. Methotrexate may be used as monotherapy or in combination with other drugs, including oral agents and newer biologics. In some disorders, methotrexate is not only disease-altering but also life-saving.

Methotrexate has been implicated as a cause of serious lung toxicity. The prevalence of methotrexate-related interstitial lung disease remains unknown but has been reported to be as high as 11.6% in rheumatoid arthritis. Studies of methotrexate-induced lung disease among rheumatoid arthritis populations are confounded by the propensity to develop pulmonary infections, pulmonary manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis itself, concomitant drug use, and a higher rate of pulmonary fatalities. Distinguishing between rheumatoid arthritis-related and methotrexate-related interstitial lung disease is difficult if not impossible since the clinical and histological features overlap. Aside from case reports, all previous studies of methotrexate-related interstitial lung disease have been in rheumatoid arthritis.

A recent meta-analysis of clinical trials of rheumatoid arthritis reported a small but significant increase in infectious respiratory complications but no increase in non-infectious events among participants treated with methotrexate.

### Acute therapy-related toxicities in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia [^112XKc9n]. Haematologica (2025). Low credibility.

Various drugs can mitigate the biochemical effects of methotrexate (MTX). Folic acid supplementation and leucovorin (LCV) rescue have effectively reduced the symptoms of lysis syndrome (SLS) in patients re-exposed to high-dose MTX. Aminophylline, an adenosine antagonist, and dextromethorphan, which blocks NMDA receptors, have also been used as secondary prophylaxis. Supportive care measures, such as anti-seizure medications and close monitoring of neurological function, are essential components of the treatment strategy. Importantly, spontaneous resolution occurs in most cases, and re-challenge is recommended according to scheduled doses of MTX, although it should be deferred during the co-administration of intravenous (IV) cyclophosphamide and cytarabine.

### A large case series of acute pediatric methotrexate ingestions: Significant clinical effects are rare [^1128BNqF]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2016). Low credibility.

Objective: Significant adverse effects after acute pediatric methotrexate (MTX) exposures have been limited to parenteral exposures. Treatment recommendations for pediatric MTX exposures do not differentiate between routes of exposure. This study reports the incidence of significant clinical effects and drug-specific treatments documented in a large series of acute pediatric MTX ingestions.

Methods: Poison center records of all MTX ingestions by patients younger than 17 years from 2000 to 2005 were collected from six poison centers. The cases included all MTX ingestions, including those with additional substances. A trained reviewer, blinded to the study purpose, used a standardized data collection form to extract study data. Missing or conflicting data were reconciled with a predetermined process.

Results: Forty-seven cases were documented over six years, 42 (89%) of which were unintentional. Thirty-six percent (17/47) were male. The mean age for the unintentional ingestions was 3.7 years (range, 20 days-17 years; median, 2 years). Five cases (11%) were intentional suicidal ingestions in teenagers. The mean dose in acute, unintentional ingestions (AUIs) in all children and in children younger than 6 years was the same at 8 mg (range, 2.5–17.5 mg). Eleven patients (23%) had follow-up greater than 12 hours. No patient with an AUI developed MTX-induced sedation, hepatotoxicity, renal insufficiency, seizures, or bone marrow suppression. Three patients with an AUI received folinic acid, but no patients in this group received sodium bicarbonate or hemodialysis.

### Renal clearance and intracellular half-life essentially determine methotrexate toxicity: A case series [^1123Wjk6]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

Methotrexate (MTX) is an antirheumatic drug used worldwide for many indications of chronic inflammation and autoimmunity, including psoriasis. In principle, it is safe if monitored carefully and has major cost-effective therapeutic benefits. Major adverse events for MTX are related to folate antagonism and primarily affect highly proliferative tissues such as bone marrow and gastrointestinal mucosa. Life-threatening myelosuppression leading to sepsis with a potentially fatal outcome is the most serious complication of MTX treatment that may occur despite regular dose administration. By analyzing three cases of myelosuppression during low-dose MTX treatment with mucocutaneous manifestations, we find that impaired renal elimination is the leading cause of MTX toxicity. We identify the different durations of plasma and intracellular half-lives of MTX as the main reason for bone marrow suppression despite normal MTX trough levels.

### Renal clearance and intracellular half-life essentially determine methotrexate toxicity: A case series [^116smS3r]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

A 74-year-old woman weighing 71 kg with chronic plaque psoriasis was treated with low-dose (15 mg/wk) methotrexate (MTX) for 6 years. She recently experienced soreness of psoriatic plaques. Clinical examination revealed disseminated sharply demarcated monomorphic erosions with hemorrhagic crusts in all prior psoriatic skin lesions. Skin biopsy confirmed the presence of epidermal necrosis and dyskeratosis. MTX serum trough level was in the lower therapeutic range. Serum creatinine had increased from formerly 0.9 mg/dL (0.5–1.0 mg/dL) to 2.5 mg/dL. Laboratory abnormalities included 0.4 × 10^9/L leukocytes with virtually absent neutrophils and 103 × 10^9/L platelets (150–400 × 10^9/L). Serum levels of C-reactive protein and procalcitonin were 28.5 mg/dL (< 0.5 mg/dL) and 8.9 mg/dL (< 0.5 mg/dL), respectively, indicating septic status. Acute nephrotoxicity from MTX was diagnosed, leading to impaired MTX elimination and severe granulocytopenia.

This case suggested three possible causes for the painful ulceration of psoriatic plaques: (1) administration of methotrexate for the first time, (2) psoriatic flare, and (3) increased methotrexate toxicity with the combined use of methotrexate and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for joint pain. Although the laboratory parameters were all within normal limits, unexpected painful superficial ulceration and histopathologic results suggested methotrexate toxicity.

Increased erythema and ulceration of psoriatic plaques in the presence of a normal laboratory profile should not always be considered an exacerbation of the disease itself, as it could be an indicator of methotrexate toxicity. Awareness of the sequelae in methotrexate-induced skin ulceration is also important to prevent fatal bone marrow suppression by discontinuing the use of methotrexate in time. Proper monitoring and regular review of concomitant medications are mandatory during methotrexate treatment.

### Fatal methotrexate toxicity: Could it have been avoided [^114mt8PZ]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Low credibility.

Methotrexate is used judiciously, only when specifically indicated. However, in this case, the patient had a fatal outcome after only three doses. A young nulliparous woman was diagnosed with high-risk persistent trophoblastic disease and was considered for multidrug chemotherapy. However, due to a persistent low-grade fever, it was decided to administer only a single agent, methotrexate. She developed severe toxicity that proved fatal even before the first course could be completed.

Analyzing the causes of this rare, unexpected outcome of methotrexate administration suggested that the estimation of serum levels can be a useful tool in monitoring patients showing hypersensitivity, although this facility is rarely available, especially in low-resource countries. Pharmacogenetic analysis of blood or tissue samples may be useful in identifying patients likely to exhibit a hypersensitivity reaction.

### Implantable photoelectrochemical-therapeutic methotrexate monitoring system with dual-atomic docking strategy [^112FWC1g]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

To thoroughly evaluate potential toxic side effects across different treatment groups, internal organs of the mice from each group were examined and subjected to pathological assessments following a 14-day experimental period. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 43, observations from internal anatomy indicated no significant abnormalities in the appearance of organs (heart, liver, spleen, lung, and kidney) in the control group, C-MTX group, and TDM-ST treatment group. This suggests that the pharmaceutical interventions in these groups did not cause considerable damage to these organs' appearance. Conversely, mice in the TDM-RT group exhibited enlarged spleens due to toxic damage induced by the elevated drug concentration.

To validate this assumption, pathological examinations were conducted. As illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 44, no discernible pathological injuries were found in the organs of the control group, C-MTX group, and TDM-ST treatment group, confirming that the pharmaceutical interventions in these groups were relatively safe. However, pathological findings in the TDM-RT group revealed hepatocyte necrosis (arrow) and vacuolar degeneration, implying that high concentrations of MTX may exert toxic effects on the liver, leading to compromised liver function (Fig. 4i). Additionally, the spleen's original structure was also disrupted, with a substantial abnormal proliferation of macrophages observed (circles in Fig. 4i). This might be due to the diminished metabolic function following liver damage, resulting in the failure to expedite the excretion of toxins and waste.

### Monotherapy with methotrexate for primary central nervous system lymphoma has single agent activity in the absence of radiotherapy: a single institution cohort [^1149my9P]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

We retrospectively reviewed the toxicities and responses of a cohort of primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) patients treated with high-dose parenteral methotrexate (MTX) monotherapy without whole brain radiation. From the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Cancer Registry, active since 1946, we selected all immunocompetent patients with histologic and/or radiographic PCNSL diagnosed between 1980 and 2007, identifying those who received MTX with leucovorin rescue as sole therapy. No patient received radiation therapy (XRT). We analyzed this cohort for toxicity, response, and patterns of recurrence.

The cohort of 121 patients received, on average, 11 cycles of intravenous MTX at a median dose of 8 g/m². The median interval between cycles was 10 days. After three months of therapy, the overall response rate was 85% (58% CR, 27% PR). The overall survival (OS) for the cohort was seven years, and progression-free survival (PFS) was 3.14 years. A trend toward a higher PFS was observed in patients who continued to receive MTX (3.48 years) every three months compared to patients who ceased MTX after one year (2.86 years).

Of 68 patients who achieved initial CR, there were 40 recurrences. Twenty-six of the 40 were re-induced with MTX as above; 69% again achieved CR. Eighty-one treatment-related toxicities occurred in 1316 MTX cycles. These toxicities included MRI white matter changes (N = 8) and led to MTX cessation in 16 patients. High-dose MTX monotherapy of PCNSL is well-tolerated and provides PFS of > 3 years and OS > 7 years.

### Methotrexate efficacy, but not its intolerance, is associated with the dose and route of administration [^1146xsfb]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2016). Low credibility.

The spectrum of adverse events of MTX therapy has expanded by the recognition and systematic evaluation of the so-called conditioned response in the form of anticipatory and associative intolerance. In this study, we attempted to distinguish toxic adverse events limited to laboratory changes and post-dose gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms from the intolerance featuring GI symptoms around MTX administration (anticipatory) and when thinking about MTX (associative) using a previously validated scoring system, MISS. In addition, behavioral symptoms at MTX administration were also systematically recorded.

The proportion of patients who featured measurable toxic adverse events, such as transaminase elevation and/or cytopenia, was similar to published series and was mild and easy to manage in most cases. The presence of patient-reported GI toxicity, as well as intolerance and behavioral symptoms, was frequent. MTX intolerance (MISS ≥ 6) was recorded in at least one visit during the 12 months of treatment in 45.5% of our patients. This figure is similar to that reported by Bulatovič and van Dijkhuizen (50.5% and 41.5%, respectively), despite the fact that our patients received higher MTX doses (14.2 mg/m² versus 10.2 and 9.9 mg/m², respectively) administered parenterally in most cases. This finding does not support the presence of a direct relationship between MTX dose and route of administration and its intolerance. This is in agreement with our previous observation where higher doses of MTX associated with increased intracellular MTX concentrations did not lead to an increased rate of intolerance.

### Leucovorin calcium [^115L7MuH]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Leucovorin calcium rescue is indicated after high-dose methotrexate therapy in osteosarcoma. It is also indicated to diminish the toxicity and counteract the effects of impaired methotrexate elimination and inadvertent overdoses of folic acid antagonists.

Leucovorin calcium is used in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible. Furthermore, leucovorin is indicated for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. However, leucovorin should not be mixed in the same infusion as 5-fluorouracil because a precipitate may form.

### Toxicity profile of high-dose methotrexate in young children with central nervous system tumors [^1149nnKS]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2024). Low credibility.

High-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) is used in the treatment of children with central nervous system (CNS) tumors; however, toxicity information is limited. We characterized toxicities following 102 administrations of HD-MTX (4.6–13.5 g/m²) infused over 4 or 24 hours in 38 children with a CNS tumor before 6 years of age (2010–2020). Delayed clearance of methotrexate occurred following 24% of infusions. Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v5 grade 2–3 mucositis was observed in 47% of individuals, grade 4 neutropenia in 76%, and grade 3–4 thrombocytopenia in 58%. No neurotoxicity was observed. HD-MTX can be safely used with supportive care and monitoring.

### Efficacy of folinic acid rescue following MTX GVHD prophylaxis: results of a double-blind, randomized, controlled study [^113t7oaj]. Blood Advances (2020). Low credibility.

Use of methotrexate (MTX) for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis is associated with increased rates of organ-specific toxicities. Despite limited data, the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation-European LeukemiaNet working group recommends the use of folinic acid (FA) rescue to reduce MTX toxicity after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT). In a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial, we explored whether FA rescue reduces MTX-induced toxicity. We enrolled patients undergoing allo-HCT with myeloablative conditioning and peripheral blood stem cell grafts, with GVHD prophylaxis consisting of cyclosporine and MTX.

Patients were randomized to receive FA or placebo starting 24 hours after each MTX dose and continuing over 24 hours in 3 to 4 divided doses. The primary endpoint was the rate of grades 3 and 4 oral mucositis. After enrollment of 52 patients (FA, n = 28; placebo, n = 24), a preplanned interim analysis revealed similar rates of grade 3 and 4 oral mucositis (46.6% vs. 45.8%; p = 0.97) and grades 1 to 4 oral mucositis (83.3% vs. 77.8%; p = 0.65). With a median follow-up of 17 months (range, 4.5–50 months), there was no difference in the rates of acute and chronic GVHD, disease relapse, nonrelapse mortality, and overall survival. These interim results did not support the continuation of the study. We conclude that FA rescue after MTX GVHD prophylaxis does not decrease regimen-related toxicity or affect transplantation outcomes.

### Methotrexate-induced neurotoxicity in oncology: Current issues for a classic drug [^11665qni]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2025). Low credibility.

Methotrexate (MTX) is an antimetabolite with immunosuppressive and antineoplastic properties extensively used in cancer treatment. It is administered through various routes, including intravenous and intrathecal, and it inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, thereby disrupting folic acid metabolism and impeding DNA synthesis. Despite its efficacy, MTX administration can result in significant toxicity, affecting multiple organs and leading to potential side effects such as myelosuppression, hepatotoxicity, renal failure, mucositis, and neurotoxicity. MTX-induced neurotoxicity is a critical problem, with manifestations varying from hours to years post-administration and ranging from transient and reversible to severe presentations.

Several risk factors may contribute to MTX-induced neurotoxicity, including genetic predisposition, drug interactions, renal impairment, and concurrent radiotherapy. Management strategies in preventing and mitigating neurotoxicity are based on supportive measures such as hydration, leucovorin rescue, and the use of glucarpidase. This review focuses on the neurotoxic effects of MTX, which is a global health issue in the growing cancer population.

### Xatmep [^116WFoCt]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **Embryo-fetal toxicity**: Based on published reports and the mechanism of action of methotrexate, it can cause embryo-fetal toxicity and fetal death when administered to a pregnant woman. In pregnant women with non-malignant diseases, methotrexate is contraindicated. Consider the benefits and risks of Xatmep and the risks to the fetus when prescribing Xatmep to a pregnant patient with a neoplastic disease. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during therapy and for 6 months after the final dose. Advise males of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during and for at least 3 months after the final methotrexate dose [see Contraindications (4), Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3), Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)].

- **Ineffective immunization and risks associated with live vaccines**: Immunization may be ineffective when given during Xatmep therapy. Immunization with live virus vaccines is not recommended. There have been reports of disseminated vaccinia infections after smallpox immunization in patients receiving methotrexate therapy.

- **Effects on reproduction**: Based on published reports, methotrexate can cause impairment of fertility, oligospermia, and menstrual dysfunction. It is not known if the infertility is reversible in affected patients. Discuss the risk of effects on reproduction with female and male patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3)].

- **Increased toxicity due to third-space accumulation**: Methotrexate can exit slowly from third-space accumulations, resulting in a prolonged terminal plasma half-life.

### Lower extremity non-blanchable purpura secondary to methotrexate toxicity: A case report [^115JxjiJ]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

Methotrexate is an antimetabolite drug that works as a folic acid analogue to inhibit DNA synthesis. This drug is commonly used for treating conditions such as psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, atopic dermatitis, and collagen disease. Although methotrexate may have common adverse effects such as bone marrow suppression and liver abnormalities, less commonly encountered side effects include lower extremity cutaneous blistering and skin necrosis. To our knowledge, there have been no case reports that have described methotrexate toxicity to the foot and ankle. This case report highlights a case of a 61-year-old patient who initially presented to our hospital with a 2-day history of worsening pain, swelling, and blistering of his feet. The patient's initial diagnosis was secondary to burns; however, with thorough investigation, imaging, and a punch biopsy, the final diagnosis was secondary to methotrexate toxicity. This case emphasizes the importance of a thorough history and physical examination for proper diagnosis and treatment of the adverse effect of methotrexate toxicity.

### Reduced dose folinic acid rescue after rapid high-dose methotrexate clearance is not associated with increased toxicity in a pediatric cohort [^116prqdY]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2022). High credibility.

Methotrexate (MTX) is an antimetabolite that functions as a folic acid antagonist. MTX can be administered over a wide dose range, from 20 mg/m² orally per week in maintenance chemotherapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) to a high intravenous dose of 33,000 mg/m² when combined with folinic acid (FA) rescue. High-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) therapy, defined as doses of 500 mg/m² or higher, can cause significant toxicity. To prevent toxicity, intravenous hydration with urine alkalinization and pharmacokinetically guided FA rescue is used in conjunction with HD-MTX therapy.

Despite supportive care, HD-MTX can induce nephrotoxicity, resulting in the accumulation of toxic concentrations of MTX, delayed elimination, and an increased risk of severe toxic adverse events. Prolonged MTX exposure can cause myelosuppression, mucositis, hepatotoxicity, and, in severe cases, multi-organ failure. MTX can also cause acute, subacute, and long-term neurotoxicity, which has been reported in 3.8 to 15.5% of ALL patients receiving HD-MTX. Increased toxicity after HD-MTX has been attributed to the use of inadequate FA doses and to a delay in commencing FA rescue. However, the minimum duration and dose of FA rescue needed to prevent excess toxicity after HD-MTX remains unclear. Furthermore, using higher doses of FA after HD-MTX has been associated with an increased risk of leukemic relapse.

In the present study, we describe a series of 44 patients with pediatric ALL who received a total of 350 courses of 5 g/m² HD-MTX followed by a pharmacokinet…

### Methotrexate monotherapy versus methotrexate combination therapy with non-biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs for rheumatoid arthritis [^111B19fJ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Methotrexate (MTX) is among the most effective disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with less toxicity and better tolerability.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of MTX monotherapy compared to MTX combination with non-biologic DMARDs in adults with RA.

- **Search strategy**: Trials were identified in MEDLINE (1950 to 2009), EMBASE (1980 to 2009), the Cochrane Controlled Trials Registry (CENTRAL) (up to 2009), the American and European scientific meeting abstracts (2005–2009), and the reference lists of all relevant studies, letters, and review articles.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials comparing MTX monotherapy versus MTX combined with other non-biologic DMARDs with at least 12 weeks of trial duration in adult RA patients.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two reviewers independently identified eligible studies, extracted the data, and assessed the risk of bias of relevant studies. The efficacy analysis was stratified into three groups based on previous DMARDs use: DMARD naive, MTX inadequate response, and non-MTX DMARDs inadequate response. The toxicity analysis was stratified by DMARD combination and pooled across trials for each combination. Our prespecified primary analysis was based on total withdrawal rates for efficacy or toxicity.

- **Main results**: A total of 19 trials (2,025 patients) from 6,938 citations were grouped by the type of patients randomized. Trials in DMARD naive patients showed no significant advantage of the MTX combination versus monotherapy; withdrawals for lack of efficacy or toxicity were similar.

### Methotrexate efficacy, but not its intolerance, is associated with the dose and route of administration [^112eNjRH]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2016). Low credibility.

There were no serious adverse events, such as infections or pulmonary toxicity, that would require hospital admission throughout the study period. Logistic regression analysis did not demonstrate any significant associations between methotrexate (MTX) intolerance and patient, disease, and treatment variables. There was a trend towards increased odds for MTX intolerance in patients treated with parenteral MTX (OR [95% CI] = 2.44 [0.56, 10.65], p = 0.236), those with a polyarticular course of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) (OR [95% CI] = 1.43 [0.36, 5.78], p = 0.612), and those with a higher age at MTX start (OR [95% CI] = 1.45 [0.48, 4.47], p = 0.505).

- **Potential predictive factors**: Potential predictive factors for good MTX tolerance included higher Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire (CHAQ) values, a shorter interval from disease onset to treatment, and male gender.

### Otrexup [^114925cL]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Based on published reports and methotrexate's mechanism of action, methotrexate can cause embryo-fetal toxicity and fetal death when administered to a pregnant woman [see Data and Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)]. In pregnant women with non-malignant disease, Otrexup is contraindicated. Consider the benefits and risks of Otrexup and risks to the fetus when prescribing Otrexup to a pregnant patient. There are no animal data that meet standards for nonclinical developmental toxicity studies.

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2–4% and 15–20%, respectively.

### Reduced dose folinic acid rescue after rapid high-dose methotrexate clearance is not associated with increased toxicity in a pediatric cohort [^114EQxjP]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2022). Low credibility.

Methotrexate clearance: If the MTX concentration result was available within 6 hours of sampling, patients with S-MTX levels ≤ 0.2 μmol/L at 42 hours received only one dose of FA, while those with S-MTX levels ≤ 0.2 μmol/L at 48 hours received two doses according to the protocol. Rapid MTX clearance, resulting in only one or two FA doses being administered, followed 181 courses of HD-MTX (51.7%). Only a single dose of FA was given following 55 HD-MTX courses (15.7%). Figure 1a shows the number of courses with rapid MTX clearance per child. An average of 4.1 (± 2.0) courses per patient was followed by rapid MTX clearance. There were only three patients without rapid MTX clearance in any course and no patient with rapid MTX clearance throughout all eight courses. Figure 1b shows the percentage of patients with rapid MTX clearance following each HD-MTX course.

- **Figure 1**:
	a. Number of courses with rapid methotrexate clearance (serum methotrexate ≤ 0.2 μmol/L at hour 42 or hour 48) per patient. Data was missing for one course of high-dose methotrexate in two different patients.
	b. Percentage of patients with rapid methotrexate clearance (serum methotrexate ≤ 0.2 μmol/L at hour 42 or hour 48) in different courses. Data was missing for one patient regarding the first course (1) of high-dose methotrexate and for one patient regarding the last course (8).

The overall mean steady-state concentration at 23 hours (throughout HD-MTX courses 1 to 8) did not differ significantly between courses with and without rapid MTX clearance (50.5 vs. 54.1 μmol/L, p = 0.213). However, the mean 23-hour steady-state concentra…

### Low-dose methotrexate-induced ulcerated psoriatic plaques: A rare case [^112xhhRE]. JAAD Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Low-dose methotrexate is an effective and safe management for extensive and severe psoriasis. It may cause adverse reactions ranging from trivial to life-threatening. Among them, hepatotoxicity and pancytopenia are the commonly serious side effects, whereas painful ulceration of psoriatic plaques as an early cutaneous manifestation of low-dose methotrexate toxicity has rarely been reported. Here, we describe a case of psoriatic plaque ulceration induced by low-dose methotrexate and highlight the risk factors and possible mechanisms of toxicity.

### Methotrexate efficacy, but not its intolerance, is associated with the dose and route of administration [^113AGjAW]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2016). Low credibility.

During the 12-month follow-up, measurable toxicity of methotrexate (MTX) was recorded in 8 patients (15.4%): elevation of transaminases in 7 patients and cytopenia in 1 patient. In 3 cases, these adverse events led to MTX withdrawal, while in the remaining 5 children, results normalized following a short treatment interruption or MTX dose reduction. None of the patients reported significant oral ulcers or injection site reactions.

- **Methotrexate (MTX) toxicity and intolerance**: Presence of patient-reported gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity, associative/anticipatory intolerance, and behavioral symptoms is summarized. Only 11 out of 55 patients (20%) reported no adverse events throughout the observational period (MISS = 0 at every visit). Intolerance (MISS ≥ 6) slowly developed during the initial months of treatment and was present in a maximum of 25.5% of patients at 6 months. It remained relatively stable thereafter (30.6% at 12 months). This cut-off MISS value for the definition of intolerance was reached at least once in 25 out of 55 children (45.5%). Concomitant treatment with biologics did not have any significant impact on the MISS at 12 months.

In the majority of cases, intolerance was managed to the patient and family satisfaction by treatment modifications and various other actions and their combinations: change in the route and/or timing of MTX administration, MTX dose reduction, addition of antiemetics, and counseling. MTX withdrawal was the ultimate solution in only 2 patients (8%).

### Altered folate homeostasis in children with Down syndrome: A potential basis for enhanced methotrexate toxicity [^117Fwbrb]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

Methotrexate is used to treat autoimmune and oncologic diseases in children with Down syndrome; however, increased methotrexate-related toxicity is reported in this population. We evaluated differences in the concentrations and distribution of erythrocyte folates in children with Down syndrome as a potential basis for this enhanced toxicity.

### Severe multiorgan toxicity after first dose of Capizzi methotrexate in a young adult patient with acute lymphocytic leukaemia [^116wwYET]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Methotrexate is a versatile antineoplastic and immunosuppressive agent. We report a case of a young adult on the Cancer and Leukaemia Group B 10403 treatment protocol for B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. She had previously completed the induction and consolidation phases with good tolerance and then started on Capizzi methotrexate during the interim maintenance phase. A few days after receiving one intermediate dose of methotrexate, she developed severe multiorgan toxicities, including pancytopaenia and several dermatologic toxicities. The patient underwent extensive diagnostic workup, with all results negative, eventually pointing towards severe methotrexate toxicity.

This case highlights the broad spectrum of toxicities that can occur even with low doses of methotrexate. Capizzi methotrexate therapy implies no leucovorin therapy, hence putting patients at risk for multiorgan toxicity. Our experience reinforces the importance of close monitoring for patients receiving methotrexate, regardless of dose, and the prompt administration of high-dose leucovorin once toxicity is suspected.

### Association between low-dose methotrexate exposure and melanoma: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^11114Qon]. JAMA Dermatology (2022). High credibility.

Methotrexate is widely used for the treatment of inflammatory disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis. Studies suggest that methotrexate may be associated with an increased risk of melanoma.

- **Objective**: To determine whether methotrexate exposure is associated with an increased risk of cutaneous melanoma.

- **Data sources**: MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched from inception to May 12, 2022, for eligible studies.

- **Study selection**: Case-control studies, cohort studies, or randomized clinical trials (RCTs) were included if they examined the odds or risk of cutaneous melanoma in individuals exposed to low-dose methotrexate in comparison with those unexposed. No language limitations were applied.

- **Data extraction and synthesis**: Two independent reviewers extracted data on study characteristics and outcome data. The Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines were followed. To assess study quality, the Cochrane risk of bias tool was used for RCTs, and the Joanna Briggs Institute Checklist was used for cohort and case-control studies. Odds ratio from case-control studies and relative risk or hazard ratio from cohort studies or RCTs were pooled, and a random-effects model meta-analysis was conducted.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The prespecified outcome was the odds ratio, hazard ratio, or risk ratio of cutaneous melanoma comparing low-dose methotrexate exposure with nonexposure.

- **Results**: Seventeen studies (8 RCTs, 5 cohort studies, 4 case-control studies) were eligible for inclusion.

### Review of dextromethorphan administration in 18 patients with subacute methotrexate central nervous system toxicity [^1156jbo2]. Pediatric Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

The pathogenesis of methotrexate central nervous system toxicity is multifactorial, likely relating to central nervous system folate homeostasis. The use of folinate rescue has been described as decreasing toxicity in patients who received intrathecal methotrexate. Previous studies report elevated levels of homocysteine in the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid of such patients, where homocysteine acts as an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor agonist. Dextromethorphan, a noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist, has been employed in treating sudden neurological dysfunction associated with methotrexate toxicity. Its impact on recovery speed remains unclear, and its use is controversial. This study reviews the use of dextromethorphan in subacute methotrexate central nervous system toxicity.

- **Methods**: Charts of 18 patients who experienced sudden neurological impairments after receiving methotrexate and were treated with dextromethorphan were reviewed.

- **Results**: The administration of dextromethorphan in most patients resulted in symptomatic improvement. Earlier administration led to faster improvement of impairments and helped prevent seizure activity recurrence induced by methotrexate central nervous system toxicity.

- **Conclusions**: Our study supports using dextromethorphan in patients with subacute methotrexate central nervous system toxicity.

### The genetic architecture of methotrexate toxicity is similar in Drosophila melanogaster and humans [^111jqcH6]. G3 (2013). Low credibility.

Despite the fact that chemotoxicity assays are difficult to perform in humans, it is possible to identify a priori human candidate genes for methotrexate toxicity based on the methotrexate cellular pathway. We identified additional candidate genes from publications by using a PubMed search with keywords "methotrexate", "toxicity", and "polymorphism". The resulting set of 137 publications was manually curated to include only those in which the patient's germline genotype (not a tumor's genotype) impacted toxicity.

We limited our search to studies in humans and excluded any in which the polymorphisms' effects on toxicity were not statistically significant, as there is considerable heterogeneity in the literature regarding what constitutes statistical significance. After identifying the a priori candidates, we used the browser to identify the orthologs of those genes in D. melanogaster. The ortholog types are listed along with D. melanogaster gene names. The remaining human candidate genes, which are not associated with publications reporting a germline genetic polymorphism impacting MTX toxicity, are believed to be in the pathway that processes MTX based on biochemical studies.

The role of these "pathway implicated" genes is discussed most fully in a recent review. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) is a strong human a priori candidate gene family with known pharmacogenetic polymorphisms, but Ensembl's fly ortholog prediction seems incorrect. We define the human GST fly orthologs to be the closest equivalent based on the available data.

### Polymorphisms in folate, pyrimidine, and purine metabolism are associated with efficacy and toxicity of methotrexate in psoriasis [^116ur4Bs]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Methotrexate is the gold standard therapy for moderate to severe psoriasis, but there is marked interpersonal variation in its efficacy and toxicity. We hypothesized that in psoriasis patients, specific common polymorphisms in folate, pyrimidine, and purine metabolic enzymes are associated with methotrexate efficacy and/or toxicity. DNA from 203 retrospectively recruited psoriasis patients treated with methotrexate was collected and genotyped by restriction endonuclease digestion or length polymorphism assays. The reduced folate carrier (RFC) 80A allele and the thymidylate synthase (TS) 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) 6 bp deletion were associated with methotrexate-induced toxicity (P = 0.025 and P = 0.025, respectively). RFC 80A and 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide transformylase (ATIC) 347G were associated with methotrexate discontinuation (P = 0.048 and P = 0.038). The TS 5'-UTR 28 bp 3R polymorphism correlated with poor clinical outcome (P = 0.029). However, this was not the case when patients with palmoplantar pustular psoriasis were not included in the analysis. Stronger associations between specific polymorphisms and methotrexate-induced toxicity and discontinuation were found in a subanalysis of patients on methotrexate not receiving folic acid supplementation. We have demonstrated preliminary evidence that specific polymorphisms of enzymes involved in folate, pyrimidine, and purine metabolism could be useful in predicting clinical response to methotrexate in patients with psoriasis.

### The genetic architecture of methotrexate toxicity is similar in Drosophila melanogaster and humans [^112tNBDf]. G3 (2013). Low credibility.

Methotrexate (MTX) is among the many chemotherapeutic medications prescribed to patients that have been shown to be very toxic. MTX is an antifolate drug used primarily to treat childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia and rheumatoid arthritis. Its toxicity includes gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea; central nervous system toxicity; hepatitis with increased transaminase levels; serious or life-threatening skin reactions; and a decrease in the activity of the patient's immune system. Although MTX is effective in the treatment of some patients, for others, its toxicity is unbearable, and patients often are forced to change the dose or switch to a different drug; in the meantime, the disease progresses.

This difference in a patient's ability to tolerate such toxic medications has often been attributed to environmental factors such as diet, medical history, and age. However, these factors do not explain all of the underlying toxicity, and there is strong evidence that, alternatively, genes in concert with the environment govern toxicity. Although it is desirable to study the underlying genetic architecture of MTX's toxicity, doing so in humans is difficult. Chemotherapy dosing often is personalized; a patient can be taking several medications, and interindividual variation in environmental factors such as age, weight, and diet makes genetic characterization of toxicity challenging.

We have previously shown that there is a strong genetic component to MTX toxicity, as quantified by the reduction in fecundity following a three-day MTX.
