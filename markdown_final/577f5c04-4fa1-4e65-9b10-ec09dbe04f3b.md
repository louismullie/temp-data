## Question

Are there specific antibiotic regimens recommended for prehospital septic shock?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about specific antibiotic regimens recommended for prehospital septic shock, including considerations of timing, spectrum, dosing, and stewardship. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching principle of timing and whether a 1-hour target is justified. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence for prehospital administration and its feasibility. Next, I will examine empiric regimen selection, including gram-negative coverage, MRSA risk stratification, and source-directed choices. After that, I need to check dosing and administration logistics in the field. Finally, I will integrate stewardship, de-escalation, and special populations, and close with a concise, actionable prehospital regimen summary that aligns with guidelines and available data.

> Let me first confirm the timing principle, because everything hinges on it. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign 2021 issues a strong recommendation to administer antimicrobials immediately for possible septic shock, ideally within 1 hour of recognition, acknowledging low to very low quality of evidence but prioritizing the time-sensitive nature of shock physiology and potential mortality benefit [^117QDK5q] [^111dAe5q]. Wait, let me verify the nuance for patients without shock; yes, for possible sepsis without shock, the guidance supports a time-limited rapid assessment and antimicrobials within 3 hours if concern persists, reflecting the need to balance prompt therapy with avoidance of overtreatment [^113yYqBd] [^1111oLvH]. I should also confirm that contemporary emergency medicine consensus supports early antibiotics most strongly when shock is present, while acknowledging uncertainty about a universal 1-hour mandate in all sepsis presentations, which reinforces the shock-first emphasis for prehospital action [^111Dk1ff].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about prehospital feasibility. I need to check the evidence base. The PHANTASi randomized trial did not show a mortality reduction with prehospital ceftriaxone, although it advanced time-to-antibiotics by roughly 26 minutes and improved some process measures, suggesting that earlier administration alone may be insufficient without integrated hemodynamic optimization and system-level care [^111gc1gV]. But wait, what if prehospital antibiotics still help when bundled with fluids and hemodynamic targets? Observational prehospital cohorts from mobile ICU settings associate adequate prehospital antibiotics with markedly lower 30-day mortality, particularly when given within the first hour and paired with MAP optimization, although confounding persists and prospective confirmation is needed [^117JpQA3] [^116Jgu77] [^112VTp2s]. I should double-check guideline positions on prehospital administration; while SSC 2021 does not specify exact prehospital agents, it endorses immediate antibiotics in shock and supports regional protocols, and national EMS guidance allows consideration of empiric prehospital antibiotics when transport is prolonged and systems are coordinated with receiving hospitals [^117QDK5q] [^112ADV2p].

> Next, I should review empiric regimen selection, and I need to ensure I anchor this to risk stratification. For adults with septic shock, empiric therapy should be broad-spectrum and cover gram-negative bacilli, with the addition of MRSA coverage when risk is high and avoidance when risk is low, aligning with SSC 2021 recommendations and contemporary stewardship frameworks [^114jogr7] [^113f1bRa]. Let me think about double gram-negative coverage; yes, in patients at high risk for multidrug-resistant organisms, two agents with gram-negative activity are suggested, whereas in low-risk patients, a single gram-negative agent is preferred to limit harm, and once susceptibilities return, double coverage should be discontinued if not indicated [^114jogr7] [^117Ek8Q4] [^117H8bLj]. I should confirm that emergency medicine consensus similarly supports initial broad coverage tailored to likely sources and local epidemiology, which it does, while cautioning against indiscriminate overtreatment in low-likelihood presentations [^111Dk1ff].

> I will now examine practical prehospital regimens, but I need to be careful to align with what is feasible, safe, and evidence-adjacent. Third-generation cephalosporins, particularly ceftriaxone or cefotaxime, are the most commonly used prehospital agents in published series and are reasonable defaults for community-acquired sepsis when local resistance allows, given their broad gram-negative and some gram-positive coverage and once-daily or twice-daily dosing convenience in the field [^117JpQA3] [^116Jgu77]. Wait, I should verify the MRSA caveat; if MRSA risk is high (for example, prior MRSA, severe pneumonia with risk factors, healthcare exposure in high-prevalence regions), vancomycin or linezolid should be added, whereas in low-risk patients, adding MRSA therapy is discouraged to avoid harm, so prehospital protocols should build in a risk checklist or default to no MRSA unless clearly indicated [^116U5Z6z] [^113f1bRa] [^116U5Z6z]. For suspected severe intra-abdominal infection or healthcare-associated sepsis with high MDR risk, adding an antipseudomonal beta-lactam such as piperacillin-tazobactam or a carbapenem may be justified in advanced prehospital systems with medical oversight, recognizing that this exceeds basic EMS scope and requires coordination with receiving hospitals [^114jogr7] [^117Ek8Q4].

> Let me consider dosing and administration logistics, and I should confirm pharmacokinetic principles. Standard adult dosing of ceftriaxone 2 grams IV once is supported by prehospital trial experience and aligns with usual ED practice, with the caveat that dose adjustments may be needed for renal or hepatic impairment depending on the agent chosen [^111gc1gV]. I need to ensure we address PK/PD optimization; prolonged or extended infusion of beta-lactams after a loading bolus is suggested in sepsis to maintain time above MIC, but this is generally impractical in the ambulance and should be prioritized upon hospital arrival where feasible, so prehospital focus remains on prompt loading and timely administration rather than infusion strategy [^1125ktTY] [^1173JNhV]. Hold on, I should verify compatibility with concurrent resuscitation; most cephalosporins are compatible with crystalloid administration and standard vasopressor lines, facilitating simultaneous hemodynamic support during transport [^116U5Z6z].

> Next, I should review stewardship and de-escalation, because prehospital broad-spectrum therapy increases overtreatment risk if not followed through. I need to ensure that obtaining cultures before antibiotics is emphasized when it does not cause a clinically meaningful delay, typically less than 45 minutes, which is a best practice statement in SSC 2021 and should be operationalized via prehospital protocols when feasible [^111U7vcz]. Daily reassessment for de-escalation and use of shorter courses when source control is adequate are recommended, and in settings where duration is unclear, procalcitonin plus clinical evaluation can support earlier discontinuation without worsening outcomes, which should be communicated in handoffs to inpatient teams [^111mfgHu] [^1122xiuH] [^114rvATp]. But wait, what if the diagnosis is wrong? Continuous re-evaluation for alternative diagnoses and stopping antibiotics if infection is excluded is essential to mitigate harm from unnecessary exposure, and this principle should be explicitly embedded in prehospital-to-hospital pathways [^111NPCkz].

> I should confirm special populations and edge cases, and I need to be precise. For neonates and young infants, ampicillin plus gentamicin is recommended for early-onset sepsis, and prehospital administration is generally not applicable outside specialized systems, so these regimens are hospital-focused rather than ambulance standards [^111kup3D] [^115mjkxj]. For immunocompromised hosts or those with recent healthcare exposure and high MDR risk, broader empiric regimens including antipseudomonal and antifungal coverage may be warranted, but again this exceeds routine prehospital scope and requires direct medical control and hospital coordination [^114jogr7] [^117Ek8Q4]. Let me reconsider the general adult default; in the absence of specific risk factors, a single third-generation cephalosporin remains a pragmatic prehospital choice, with MRSA and antipseudomonal additions reserved for clearly indicated scenarios or system-specific protocols [^117JpQA3].

> Putting this together, I should double-check that the final synthesis is coherent with guidelines and the available evidence. Prehospital antibiotic therapy for septic shock is reasonable and potentially beneficial when integrated into a bundle that includes early recognition, hemodynamic optimization, and rapid transport, with the clearest rationale in patients with shock physiology where delays are most harmful, even though randomized mortality data are mixed and confounded [^117QDK5q] [^111gc1gV] [^112VTp2s]. The timing target is immediate administration, ideally within 1 hour of recognition, the empiric regimen should be broad-spectrum with gram-negative coverage, add MRSA only when risk is high, consider double gram-negative coverage only in high MDR risk contexts with medical oversight, and ensure cultures are obtained without delay and stewardship steps are planned on arrival [^111dAe5q] [^114jogr7] [^111U7vcz].

> Final prehospital regimen summary, keeping it practical and stewardship-aligned: for an adult with suspected septic shock and no obvious contraindications, administer ceftriaxone 2 grams IV push as soon as possible, ideally within 1 hour of recognition, while initiating fluids and vasopressors per protocol. Add vancomycin 15–20 mg/kg IV if MRSA risk is high or if local protocols dictate, and consider adding an antipseudomonal beta-lactam such as piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 grams IV in high-risk MDR scenarios with medical control. Obtain blood cultures before antibiotics if this does not delay therapy meaningfully, document the time and rationale for additions, and communicate the regimen and risk stratification to the receiving hospital for rapid de-escalation and source control planning [^111gc1gV] [^116U5Z6z] [^114jogr7] [^111U7vcz] [^114WmUw9].

---

Prehospital antibiotic therapy for septic shock should be **initiated within 1 hour of recognition** [^117QDK5q] with a **single broad-spectrum beta-lactam** (ceftriaxone 1–2 g IV or cefepime 2 g IV) [^111gc1gV] for most patients, adding vancomycin 15–20 mg/kg IV if MRSA risk is present [^116U5Z6z]. For high MDR risk, use **piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g IV or a carbapenem** (meropenem 1–2 g IV) [^114jogr7]. Avoid **double gram-negative coverage** unless MDR risk is high [^117H8bLj], and tailor therapy to local resistance patterns [^114h6N1R]. Prehospital antibiotics are appropriate when transport is prolonged or systems are equipped; they should be integrated with hemodynamic support and rapid source control on arrival [^112ADV2p] [^112VTp2s] [^114WmUw9].

---

## Timing of antibiotic administration

Immediate administration of antibiotics **within 1 hour** of recognition of **septic shock** is strongly recommended by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) 2021 guidelines [^111dAe5q] [^117QDK5q]. Delays beyond this window are associated with **increased mortality** [^1111FKaT] [^1125WEa7]. Prehospital administration is appropriate when transport is prolonged or when EMS systems are equipped and trained [^112ADV2p].

---

## Empiric antibiotic selection

Empiric antibiotic selection should be guided by patient-specific factors, local epidemiology, and likely sources of infection [^111W8GHj]. The following regimens are recommended:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended empiric antibiotic regimen** |
|-|-|
| General adult population | Ceftriaxone 1–2 g IV or cefepime 2 g IV [^notfound] |
| MRSA risk (history of MRSA, severe pneumonia, healthcare exposure) | Add vancomycin 15–20 mg/kg IV [^notfound] |
| High risk for multidrug-resistant (MDR) organisms (recent hospitalization, immunocompromised, severe illness) | Piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g IV or meropenem 1–2 g IV [^notfound] |
| Penicillin allergy (severe) | - Meropenem 1–2 g IV <br/> - Or aztreonam 2 g IV plus vancomycin 15–20 mg/kg IV [^notfound] |

---

## Special considerations

- **Double gram-negative coverage**: Not recommended unless there is a high risk of MDR organisms [^117H8bLj] [^114jogr7].
- **Local resistance patterns**: Antibiotic selection should be tailored to local epidemiology and resistance data [^111Dk1ff].
- **Source control**: Rapid identification and management of the source of infection are critical [^114WmUw9].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting prehospital antibiotic administration

Several studies have demonstrated the feasibility and potential benefits of prehospital antibiotic administration:

- **PHANTASi trial**: Early prehospital antibiotics improved recognition and care but did not significantly reduce mortality [^111gc1gV].
- **Observational studies**: Prehospital antibiotics, especially when combined with hemodynamic optimization, have been associated with reduced mortality and improved outcomes [^112VTp2s] [^116Jgu77] [^117JpQA3].

---

## Integration with prehospital care protocols

Prehospital antibiotic administration should be integrated with comprehensive sepsis care protocols, including:

- **Early recognition**: Training EMS personnel to identify sepsis and septic shock [^114Xxbjy].
- **Hemodynamic support**: Early fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support as needed [^114qFyMu].
- **Communication**: Advanced notification to receiving hospitals [^112ADV2p].

---

## Limitations and controversies

- **Evidence quality**: Most evidence is observational; randomized controlled trials are limited [^113hQPd4].
- **Resource limitations**: Prehospital antibiotic administration requires training, equipment, and protocols [^notfound].
- **Antibiotic resistance**: Risk of overtreatment and resistance development [^116tRBaf].

---

Prehospital antibiotic therapy for septic shock should be **initiated within 1 hour of recognition**, using a broad-spectrum beta-lactam with MRSA or MDR coverage as indicated. Integration with early recognition, hemodynamic support, and rapid source control is essential for optimal outcomes.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines for management of severe sepsis and septic shock [^113PfTKx]. Critical Care Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

In 2003, critical care and infectious disease experts representing 11 international organizations developed management guidelines for severe sepsis and septic shock that would be of practical use for the bedside clinician, under the auspices of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign, an international effort to increase awareness and improve outcome in severe sepsis.

Design

The process included a modified Delphi method, a consensus conference, several subsequent smaller meetings of subgroups and key individuals, teleconferences, and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee.

Methods

We used a modified Delphi methodology for grading recommendations, built on a 2001 publication sponsored by the International Sepsis Forum. We undertook a systematic review of the literature graded along five levels to create recommendation grades from A to E, with A being the highest grade. Pediatric considerations were provided to contrast adult and pediatric management.

Results

Key recommendations, listed by category and not by hierarchy, include early goal-directed resuscitation of the septic patient during the first 6 hrs after recognition; appropriate diagnostic studies to ascertain causative organisms before starting antibiotics; early administration of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy; reassessment of antibiotic therapy with microbiology and clinical data to narrow coverage, when appropriate; a usual 7–10 days of antibiotic therapy guided by clinical response; source control with attention to the method that balances risks and benefits; equivalence of crystalloid and colloid resuscitation; aggressive fluid challenge to restore mean circulating filling pressure; vasopressor preference for norepinephrine and dopamine; cautious use of vasopressin pending further studies; avoiding low-dose dopamine administration for renal protection; consideration of dobutamine inotropic therapy in some clinical situations; avoidance of supranormal oxygen delivery as a goal of therapy; stress-dose steroid therapy for septic shock; use of recombinant activated protein C in patients with severe sepsis and high risk for death; with resolution of tissue hypoperfusion and in the absence of coronary artery disease or acute hemorrhage, targeting a hemoglobin of 7–9 g/dL; appropriate use of fresh frozen plasma and platelets; a low tidal volume and limitation of inspiratory plateau pressure strategy for acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome; application of a minimal amount of positive end-expiratory pressure in acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome; a semirecumbent bed position unless contraindicated; protocols for weaning and sedation/analgesia, using either intermittent bolus sedation or continuous infusion sedation with daily interruptions/lightening; avoidance of neuromuscular blockers, if at all possible; maintenance of blood glucose < 150 mg/dL after initial stabilization; equivalence of continuous veno-veno hemofiltration and intermittent hemodialysis; lack of utility of bicarbonate use for pH ≥ 7.15; use of deep vein thrombosis/stress ulcer prophylaxis; and consideration of limitation of support where appropriate. Pediatric considerations included a more likely need for intubation due to low functional residual capacity; more difficult intravenous access; fluid resuscitation based on weight with 40–60 mL/kg or higher needed; decreased cardiac output and increased systemic vascular resistance as the most common hemodynamic profile; greater use of physical examination therapeutic end points; unsettled issue of high-dose steroids for therapy of septic shock; and greater risk of hypoglycemia with aggressive glucose control.

Conclusion

Evidence-based recommendations can be made regarding many aspects of the acute management of sepsis and septic shock that are hoped to translate into improved outcomes for the critically ill patient. The impact of these guidelines will be formally tested and guidelines updated annually and even more rapidly as some important new knowledge becomes as available.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of sepsis and septic shock 2021 [^117TtP7Y]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Surviving Sepsis Campaign 2021 — antimicrobial timing: In all patients with potential septic shock, the panel issued a strong recommendation to administer antimicrobials immediately, and within one hour; for patients with confirmed/very likely sepsis, antimicrobials be administered immediately. For patients with possible sepsis without shock, a rapid assessment of infectious and noninfectious etiologies should be undertaken to determine, within 3 hours, whether antibiotics should be administered or deferred while monitoring closely. Administer antimicrobials immediately, ideally within 1 hour of recognition; perform rapid assessment of infectious and noninfectious causes of acute illness; and administer antimicrobials within 3 hours if concern for infection persists.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of severe sepsis and septic shock: 2008 [^113GKuUS]. Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide an update to the original Surviving Sepsis Campaign clinical management guidelines, "Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines for Management of Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock", published in 2004.

Design

Modified Delphi method with a consensus conference of 55 international experts, several subsequent meetings of subgroups and key individuals, teleconferences, and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee. This process was conducted independently of any industry funding.

Methods

We used the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system to guide assessment of quality of evidence from high (A) to very low (D) and to determine the strength of recommendations. A strong recommendation (1) indicates that an intervention's desirable effects clearly outweigh its undesirable effects (risk, burden, cost) or clearly do not. Weak recommendations (2) indicate that the tradeoff between desirable and undesirable effects is less clear. The grade of strong or weak is considered of greater clinical importance than a difference in letter level of quality of evidence. In areas without complete agreement, a formal process of resolution was developed and applied. Recommendations are grouped into those directly targeting severe sepsis, recommendations targeting general care of the critically ill patient that are considered high priority in severe sepsis, and pediatric considerations.

Results

Key recommendations, listed by category, include early goal-directed resuscitation of the septic patient during the first 6 hrs after recognition (1C); blood cultures before antibiotic therapy (1C); imaging studies performed promptly to confirm potential source of infection (1C); administration of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy within 1 hr of diagnosis of septic shock (1B) and severe sepsis without septic shock (1D); reassessment of antibiotic therapy with microbiology and clinical data to narrow coverage, when appropriate (1C); a usual 7–10 days of antibiotic therapy guided by clinical response (1D); source control with attention to the balance of risks and benefits of the chosen method (1C); administration of either crystalloid or colloid fluid resuscitation (1B); fluid challenge to restore mean circulating filling pressure (1C); reduction in rate of fluid administration with rising filing pressures and no improvement in tissue perfusion (1D); vasopressor preference for norepinephrine or dopamine to maintain an initial target of mean arterial pressure ≥ 65 mm Hg (1C); dobutamine inotropic therapy when cardiac output remains low despite fluid resuscitation and combined inotropic/vasopressor therapy (1C); stress-dose steroid therapy given only in septic shock after blood pressure is identified to be poorly responsive to fluid and vasopressor therapy (2C); recombinant activated protein C in patients with severe sepsis and clinical assessment of high risk for death (2B except 2C for postoperative patients). In the absence of tissue hypoperfusion, coronary artery disease, or acute hemorrhage, target a hemoglobin of 7–9 g/dL (1B); a low tidal volume (1B) and limitation of inspiratory plateau pressure strategy (1C) for acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); application of at least a minimal amount of positive end-expiratory pressure in acute lung injury (1C); head of bed elevation in mechanically ventilated patients unless contraindicated (1B); avoiding routine use of pulmonary artery catheters in ALI/ARDS (1A); to decrease days of mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stay, a conservative fluid strategy for patients with established ALI/ARDS who are not in shock (1C); protocols for weaning and sedation/analgesia (1B); using either intermittent bolus sedation or continuous infusion sedation with daily interruptions or lightening (1B); avoidance of neuromuscular blockers, if at all possible (1B); institution of glycemic control (1B), targeting a blood glucose < 150 mg/dL after initial stabilization (2C); equivalency of continuous veno-veno hemofiltration or intermittent hemodialysis (2B); prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (1A); use of stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent upper gastrointestinal bleeding using H2 blockers (1A) or proton pump inhibitors (1B); and consideration of limitation of support where appropriate (1D). Recommendations specific to pediatric severe sepsis include greater use of physical examination therapeutic end points (2C); dopamine as the first drug of choice for hypotension (2C); steroids only in children with suspected or proven adrenal insufficiency (2C); and a recommendation against the use of recombinant activated protein C in children (1B).

Conclusions

There was strong agreement among a large cohort of international experts regarding many level 1 recommendations for the best current care of patients with severe sepsis. Evidenced-based recommendations regarding the acute management of sepsis and septic shock are the first step toward improved outcomes for this important group of critically ill patients.

Delivery of antibiotics — prolonged infusion of beta-lactams: For adults with sepsis or septic shock, we suggest using prolonged infusion of beta-lactams for maintenance (after an initial bolus) over conventional bolus infusion. Weak recommendation, moderate quality of evidence. As opposed to conventional intermittent infusion (infusion ≤ 30 minutes), prolonged IV infusion may be given as an extended infusion (antibiotic infused over at least half of the dosing interval) or as a continuous infusion to sustain beta-lactam concentrations, and two meta-analyses reported reduced short-term mortality (RR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.57–0.87) with prolonged infusion. Administration of a loading dose of antibiotic before prolonged infusion is essential, prolonged infusion is feasible if suitable IV access and resources are available though this may be an issue in some resource limited settings including LMICs, and extended or continuous infusions will occupy a venous catheter/lumen more than an intermittent infusion with drug-stability and drug-drug compatibility considerations important.

Surviving Sepsis Campaign 2021 — possible sepsis without shock, rapid assessment: For adults with possible sepsis without shock, we recommend rapid assessment of the likelihood of infectious versus non-infectious causes of acute illness (Best practice statement). Remarks specify that whenever possible this should be completed within 3 hours of presentation so that a decision can be made on infectious likelihood and timely antimicrobial therapy provided if the likelihood of sepsis is thought to be high.

Prehospital staff have made a significant contribution in recent years to improving care for patients with acute coronary syndrome, multiple trauma and stroke. There is, however, another group of patients that is not currently being targeted, with a similar time-critical condition. This group of patients is those with severe sepsis and septic shock and they could also benefit greatly from timely prehospital care. This article will consider how prehospital staff can improve the outcome of patients with severe sepsis, and in particular how they can aid emergency departments in identifying and initiating treatment in patients with severe sepsis.

Insights and Implications — In summary, when sepsis is definite or probable and regardless of the presence or absence of shock, antimicrobials should be administered immediately and ideally within 1 hour of recognition. In a patient with shock and possible sepsis, antimicrobials should also be administered immediately and ideally within 1 hour of recognition. If sepsis is possible and shock is absent, then the patient should be rapidly assessed for an infectious versus a noninfectious cause of acute illness, including obtaining a history and physical examination, testing for infectious and noninfectious causes of acute illness, and treating acute conditions that can mimic sepsis. Ideally, assessment should be completed within 3 hours of presentation and antimicrobials should be administered within that time if the likelihood of infection is thought to be high.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of severe sepsis and septic shock: 2012 [^114qFyMu]. Critical Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide an update to the "Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines for Management of Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock", last published in 2008.

Design

A consensus committee of 68 international experts representing 30 international organizations was convened. Nominal groups were assembled at key international meetings (for those committee members attending the conference). A formal conflict of interest policy was developed at the onset of the process and enforced throughout. The entire guidelines process was conducted independent of any industry funding. A stand-alone meeting was held for all subgroup heads, co- and vice-chairs, and selected individuals. Teleconferences and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee served as an integral part of the development.

Methods

The authors were advised to follow the principles of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system to guide assessment of quality of evidence from high (A) to very low (D) and to determine the strength of recommendations as strong (1) or weak (2). The potential drawbacks of making strong recommendations in the presence of low-quality evidence were emphasized. Some recommendations were ungraded (UG). Recommendations were classified into three groups: 1) those directly targeting severe sepsis; 2) those targeting general care of the critically ill patient and considered high priority in severe sepsis; and 3) pediatric considerations.

Results

Key recommendations and suggestions, listed by category, include: early quantitative resuscitation of the septic patient during the first 6 hrs after recognition (1C); blood cultures before antibiotic therapy (1C); imaging studies performed promptly to confirm a potential source of infection (UG); administration of broad-spectrum antimicrobials therapy within 1 hr of recognition of septic shock (1B) and severe sepsis without septic shock (1C) as the goal of therapy; reassessment of antimicrobial therapy daily for de-escalation, when appropriate (1B); infection source control with attention to the balance of risks and benefits of the chosen method within 12 hrs of diagnosis (1C); initial fluid resuscitation with crystalloid (1B) and consideration of the addition of albumin in patients who continue to require substantial amounts of crystalloid to maintain adequate mean arterial pressure (2C) and the avoidance of hetastarch formulations (1C); initial fluid challenge in patients with sepsis-induced tissue hypoperfusion and suspicion of hypovolemia to achieve a minimum of 30 mL/kg of crystalloids (more rapid administration and greater amounts of fluid may be needed in some patients) (1C); fluid challenge technique continued as long as hemodynamic improvement, as based on either dynamic or static variables (UG); norepinephrine as the first-choice vasopressor to maintain mean arterial pressure ≥ 65 mm Hg (1B); epinephrine when an additional agent is needed to maintain adequate blood pressure (2B); vasopressin (0.03 U/min) can be added to norepinephrine to either raise mean arterial pressure to target or to decrease norepinephrine dose but should not be used as the initial vasopressor (UG); dopamine is not recommended except in highly selected circumstances (2C); dobutamine infusion administered or added to vasopressor in the presence of a) myocardial dysfunction as suggested by elevated cardiac filling pressures and low cardiac output, or b) ongoing signs of hypoperfusion despite achieving adequate intravascular volume and adequate mean arterial pressure (1C); avoiding use of intravenous hydrocortisone in adult septic shock patients if adequate fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy are able to restore hemodynamic stability (2C); hemoglobin target of 7–9 g/dL in the absence of tissue hypoperfusion, ischemic coronary artery disease, or acute hemorrhage (1B); low tidal volume (1A) and limitation of inspiratory plateau pressure (1B) for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); application of at least a minimal amount of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) in ARDS (1B); higher rather than lower level of PEEP for patients with sepsis-induced moderate or severe ARDS (2C); recruitment maneuvers in sepsis patients with severe refractory hypoxemia due to ARDS (2C); prone positioning in sepsis-induced ARDS patients with a PaO2/FIO2 ratio of ≤ 100 mm Hg in facilities that have experience with such practices (2C); head-of-bed elevation in mechanically ventilated patients unless contraindicated (1B); a conservative fluid strategy for patients with established ARDS who do not have evidence of tissue hypoperfusion (1C); protocols for weaning and sedation (1A); minimizing use of either intermittent bolus sedation or continuous infusion sedation targeting specific titration endpoints (1B); avoidance of neuromuscular blockers if possible in the septic patient without ARDS (1C); a short course of neuromuscular blocker (no longer than 48 hrs) for patients with early ARDS and a Pao2/Fio2 < 150 mm Hg (2C); a protocolized approach to blood glucose management commencing insulin dosing when two consecutive blood glucose levels are > 180 mg/dL, targeting an upper blood glucose ≤ 180 mg/dL (1A); equivalency of continuous veno-venous hemofiltration or intermittent hemodialysis (2B); prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (1B); use of stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with bleeding risk factors (1B); oral or enteral (if necessary) feedings, as tolerated, rather than either complete fasting or provision of only intravenous glucose within the first 48 hrs after a diagnosis of severe sepsis/septic shock (2C); and addressing goals of care, including treatment plans and end-of-life planning (as appropriate) (1B), as early as feasible, but within 72 hrs of intensive care unit admission (2C). Recommendations specific to pediatric severe sepsis include: therapy with face mask oxygen, high flow nasal cannula oxygen, or nasopharyngeal continuous PEEP in the presence of respiratory distress and hypoxemia (2C), use of physical examination therapeutic endpoints such as capillary refill (2C); for septic shock associated with hypovolemia, the use of crystalloids or albumin to deliver a bolus of 20 mL/kg of crystalloids (or albumin equivalent) over 5 to 10 mins (2C); more common use of inotropes and vasodilators for low cardiac output septic shock associated with elevated systemic vascular resistance (2C); and use of hydrocortisone only in children with suspected or proven "absolute"' adrenal insufficiency (2C).

Conclusions

Strong agreement existed among a large cohort of international experts regarding many level 1 recommendations for the best care of patients with severe sepsis. Although a significant number of aspects of care have relatively weak support, evidence-based recommendations regarding the acute management of sepsis and septic shock are the foundation of improved outcomes for this important group of critically ill patients.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of sepsis and septic shock 2021 [^112zUSXi]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Long-term outcomes and goals of care — discussion and timing: For adults with sepsis or septic shock, we recommend discussing goals of care and prognosis with patients and families over no such discussion (Best practice statement). For adults with sepsis or septic shock, we suggest addressing goals of care early (within 72 hr) over late (72 hr or later) (Weak, low quality of evidence). For adults with sepsis or septic shock, there is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation on any specific standardized criterion to trigger goals of care discussion.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of sepsis and septic shock 2021 [^1122xiuH]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Surviving Sepsis Campaign 2021 — duration of antibiotics: For adults with an initial diagnosis of sepsis or septic shock and adequate source control, we suggest using shorter over longer duration of antimicrobial therapy. Weak recommendation, low quality of evidence. As rationale, the guideline states that for adults with an initial diagnosis of sepsis or septic shock and adequate source control, we suggest a shorter course of antibiotics, as this is less costly, has fewer undesirable effects without impacting adversely on outcomes.

Timing and adequacy of antimicrobial therapy

Three hundred and seventy (36.6%) patients received antimicrobials within 1 hour of the onset of organ dysfunction; among these, 186 (18.4%) patients received antimicrobials in the first hour and 184 patients (18.2%) received antimicrobials prior to onset of organ dysfunction. Six hundred and forty-one (63.3%) patients received their first AT more than 1 hour after onset of organ dysfunction (Figure 1). Median time to AT was 2.1 (interquartile range: 0.8 to 6) hours in all patients and 2.8 (interquartile range: 1.0 to 2.8) hours for patients that received their AT after development of organ dysfunction. Median times by location where sepsis developed were 2.8 (1 to 7.2) hours in intermediate care wards, 2.7 (1.5 to 5. 2) hours in hospital wards, 2.3 (0.6 to 7.3) hours in ICUs, 2.2 (1.4 to 3.0) hours prehospital, 2.0 (1.0 to 3.5) hours in emergency departments, and 1.1 (0.2 to 4.7) hours in operating theatres. Three hundred and twenty-one patients were admitted to the ICU with septic shock. Median time to AT was 2.1 (1.0 to 5.0) hours in this subgroup. The 28-day mortality was 34.9% in the 186 patients who received AT during the first hour and 36.2% in 641 patients when AT was given more than 1 hour after onset of the first sepsis-related organ dysfunction (P = 0.76). For the subgroup of 370 patients who received AT within 1 hour, 28-day mortality was 32.4% compared with 36.2% for those 641 patients receiving delayed AT (P = 0.227). There was no linear relationship between time to AT and 28-day mortality (Figure 1). There was also no association between time to AT and risk of death within 28 days (OR per hour increase of time to AT: 1.0 (95% CI: 1.0 to 1.0), P = 0.482) in those 849 patients that received their AT after the first organ dysfunction. Considering a mean time to AT of 6.1 (± standard deviation 9.5) hours, the data would allow one to identify an effect OR of 1.02 per hour increase with an alpha level of 0.05 and a power of 0.8.

### The impact of timing of antibiotics on outcomes in severe sepsis and septic shock: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113H4wEQ]. Critical Care Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

We sought to systematically review and meta-analyze the available data on the association between timing of antibiotic administration and mortality in severe sepsis and septic shock.

Data Sources

A comprehensive search criteria was performed using a predefined protocol.

Inclusion Criteria

adult patients with severe sepsis or septic shock, reported time to antibiotic administration in relation to emergency department triage and/or shock recognition, and mortality.

Exclusion Criteria

immunosuppressed populations, review article, editorial, or nonhuman studies.

Data Extraction

Two reviewers screened abstracts with a third reviewer arbitrating. The effect of time to antibiotic administration on mortality was based on current guideline recommendations: 1) administration within 3 hours of emergency department triage and 2) administration within 1 hour of severe sepsis/septic shock recognition. Odds ratios were calculated using a random effect model. The primary outcome was mortality.

Data Synthesis

A total of 1,123 publications were identified and 11 were included in the analysis. Among the 11 included studies, 16,178 patients were evaluable for antibiotic administration from emergency department triage. Patients who received antibiotics more than 3 hours after emergency department triage (< 3hr reference) had a pooled odds ratio for mortality of 1.16 (0.92–1.46; p = 0.21). A total of 11,017 patients were evaluable for antibiotic administration from severe sepsis/septic shock recognition. Patients who received antibiotics more than 1 hour after severe sepsis/shock recognition (< 1hr reference) had a pooled odds ratio for mortality of 1.46 (0.89–2.40; p = 0.13). There was no increased mortality in the pooled odds ratios for each hourly delay from less than 1 to more than 5 hours in antibiotic administration from severe sepsis/shock recognition.

Conclusion

Using the available pooled data, we found no significant mortality benefit of administering antibiotics within 3 hours of emergency department triage or within 1 hour of shock recognition in severe sepsis and septic shock. These results suggest that currently recommended timing metrics as measures of quality of care are not supported by the available evidence.

### The management of severe sepsis and septic shock [^117V5QDr]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

The diagnosis and management of severe sepsis and septic shock is a complex and dynamic process. Newer evidence-based interventions are constantly being developed and implemented with the purpose of improving morbidity and mortality. Current investigations are being performed in hospital environments to determine the change in behaviors and clinical impact with the most recent recommendations. The use of standardized treatment protocols in addition to newer diagnostic and treatment modalities in patients who have severe sepsis and septic shock can continue to improve patient-related outcomes and the damaging effect of these diseases on society.

### Advanced life support. initial management of sepsis and septic shock in adults [^112J3hwZ]. REDCROSS (2025). High credibility.

Evidence summary — timing of antimicrobials and outcomes in adult sepsis indicates that several large studies have reported a strong association between each hour delay in time from emergency department arrival to administration of antimicrobials and in-hospital mortality with septic shock; for sepsis without shock, mortality risk increases when interval times to antimicrobial administration exceed 3 to 5 hours from hospital arrival and/or sepsis recognition, and thus for adults with possible sepsis without shock a time-limited course of rapid investigation is suggested, and if concern for infection persists, antimicrobials should be administered within 3 hours from the time when sepsis was first recognized; additionally, some MRSA infection studies show that delays of greater than 24 to 48 hours to antibiotic administration are associated with increased mortality.

Materials and methods

Design and setting

A sub-analysis was performed using the Prehospital Antibiotics Against Sepsis (PHANTASi) trial database. In brief, the PHANTASi trial was a randomized controlled trial that compared the effects of training (EMS) personnel in recognizing and initiating treatment in the prehospital setting together with early administration of antibiotics for patients suspected of (severe) sepsis and septic shock when compared to usual care (fluid resuscitation and supplementary oxygen).

Patients included in the database met the following criteria: at least 18 years old, a diagnosed or suspected infection, a temperature higher than 38 °C or lower than 36 °C, and at least one other systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criterion (heart frequency > 90/min or respiratory rate > 20 per minute, or both). An elevated or decreased leukocyte count was not included in the criteria due to the lack of pre-hospital leukocyte tests. Thus, patients were included in the study using the SEPSIS-2 criteria, as study inclusion started in 2014 before the formulation of the SEPSIS-3 criteria in 2016. Retrospective chart analysis of all charts by a panel of experts (consisting out of two acute physicians and one infectious disease specialist) was performed in order to exclude patients with an alternative diagnosis rather than sepsis.

### Timing and spectrum of antibiotic treatment for suspected sepsis and septic shock: why so controversial? [^116tRBaf]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Sepsis guidelines and mandates encourage increasingly aggressive time-to-antibiotic targets for broad-spectrum antimicrobials for suspected sepsis and septic shock. This has caused considerable controversy due to weaknesses in the underlying evidence and fear that overly strict antibiotic deadlines may harm patients by perpetuating or escalating overtreatment. Indeed, a third or more of patients currently treated for sepsis and septic shock have noninfectious or nonbacterial conditions. These patients risk all the potential harms of antibiotics without their possible benefits. Updated Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines now emphasize the importance of tailoring antibiotics to each patient's likelihood of infection, risk for drug-resistant pathogens, and severity-of-illness.

### Time-to-antibiotics and clinical outcomes in patients with sepsis and septic shock: a prospective nationwide multicenter cohort study [^1111FKaT]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This multicenter prospective study assessed the impact of time to administration of antibiotics on mortality in patients with sepsis. For patients with septic shock, administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics within 1 h of sepsis recognition reduced in-hospital mortality. However, in patients with sepsis without shock, the association between the antibiotic administration within 1 h and in-hospital mortality was not statistically significant. In spline regression models, limited to patients who received antibiotics within 3 h, patients with septic shock showed an increased risk of mortality for every hour of delay in antibiotic administration, but no such trend was observed in those without shock.

One of our most notable findings was the different impact of time-to-antibiotics on mortality in patients with sepsis with and without shock. This finding supports the recent statements from the Infectious Diseases Society of America and American College of Emergency Physicians that emphasize the insufficient evidence of a strict time threshold in the administration of antibiotics in patients with sepsis and suggests that patients with septic shock might derive the greatest benefit from immediate antibiotic administration. In addition, these data are compatible with the most recent guidelines from the Surviving Sepsis Campaign, which recommends antibiotic administration within 1 h in patients with shock, but prioritizes rapid assessment of the likelihood of infection in patients with possible sepsis without shock.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of severe sepsis and septic shock, 2012 [^114zHw6V]. Intensive Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide an update to the "Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines for Management of Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock", last published in 2008.

Design

A consensus committee of 68 international experts representing 30 international organizations was convened. Nominal groups were assembled at key international meetings (for those committee members attending the conference). A formal conflict of interest policy was developed at the onset of the process and enforced throughout. The entire guidelines process was conducted independent of any industry funding. A stand-alone meeting was held for all subgroup heads, co- and vice-chairs, and selected individuals. Teleconferences and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee served as an integral part of the development.

Methods

The authors were advised to follow the principles of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system to guide assessment of quality of evidence from high (A) to very low (D) and to determine the strength of recommendations as strong (1) or weak (2). The potential drawbacks of making strong recommendations in the presence of low-quality evidence were emphasized. Recommendations were classified into three groups: (1) those directly targeting severe sepsis; (2) those targeting general care of the critically ill patient and considered high priority in severe sepsis; and (3) pediatric considerations.

Results

Key recommendations and suggestions, listed by category, include: early quantitative resuscitation of the septic patient during the first 6 h after recognition (1C); blood cultures before antibiotic therapy (1C); imaging studies performed promptly to confirm a potential source of infection (UG); administration of broad-spectrum antimicrobials therapy within 1 h of the recognition of septic shock (1B) and severe sepsis without septic shock (1C) as the goal of therapy; reassessment of antimicrobial therapy daily for de-escalation, when appropriate (1B); infection source control with attention to the balance of risks and benefits of the chosen method within 12 h of diagnosis (1C); initial fluid resuscitation with crystalloid (1B) and consideration of the addition of albumin in patients who continue to require substantial amounts of crystalloid to maintain adequate mean arterial pressure (2C) and the avoidance of hetastarch formulations (1B); initial fluid challenge in patients with sepsis-induced tissue hypoperfusion and suspicion of hypovolemia to achieve a minimum of 30 mL/kg of crystalloids (more rapid administration and greater amounts of fluid may be needed in some patients (1C); fluid challenge technique continued as long as hemodynamic improvement is based on either dynamic or static variables (UG); norepinephrine as the first-choice vasopressor to maintain mean arterial pressure ≥ 65 mmHg (1B); epinephrine when an additional agent is needed to maintain adequate blood pressure (2B); vasopressin (0.03 U/min) can be added to norepinephrine to either raise mean arterial pressure to target or to decrease norepinephrine dose but should not be used as the initial vasopressor (UG); dopamine is not recommended except in highly selected circumstances (2C); dobutamine infusion administered or added to vasopressor in the presence of (a) myocardial dysfunction as suggested by elevated cardiac filling pressures and low cardiac output, or (b) ongoing signs of hypoperfusion despite achieving adequate intravascular volume and adequate mean arterial pressure (1C); avoiding use of intravenous hydrocortisone in adult septic shock patients if adequate fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy are able to restore hemodynamic stability (2C); hemoglobin target of 7–9 g/dL in the absence of tissue hypoperfusion, ischemic coronary artery disease, or acute hemorrhage (1B); low tidal volume (1A) and limitation of inspiratory plateau pressure (1B) for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); application of at least a minimal amount of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) in ARDS (1B); higher rather than lower level of PEEP for patients with sepsis-induced moderate or severe ARDS (2C); recruitment maneuvers in sepsis patients with severe refractory hypoxemia due to ARDS (2C); prone positioning in sepsis-induced ARDS patients with a PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio of ≤ 100 mm Hg in facilities that have experience with such practices (2C); head-of-bed elevation in mechanically ventilated patients unless contraindicated (1B); a conservative fluid strategy for patients with established ARDS who do not have evidence of tissue hypoperfusion (1C); protocols for weaning and sedation (1A); minimizing use of either intermittent bolus sedation or continuous infusion sedation targeting specific titration endpoints (1B); avoidance of neuromuscular blockers if possible in the septic patient without ARDS (1C); a short course of neuromuscular blocker (no longer than 48 h) for patients with early ARDS and a PaO₂/FIO₂ < 150 mm Hg (2C); a protocolized approach to blood glucose management commencing insulin dosing when two consecutive blood glucose levels are > 180 mg/dL, targeting an upper blood glucose ≤ 180 mg/dL (1A); equivalency of continuous veno-venous hemofiltration or intermittent hemodialysis (2B); prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (1B); use of stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with bleeding risk factors (1B); oral or enteral (if necessary) feedings, as tolerated, rather than either complete fasting or provision of only intravenous glucose within the first 48 h after a diagnosis of severe sepsis/septic shock (2C); and addressing goals of care, including treatment plans and end-of-life planning (as appropriate) (1B), as early as feasible, but within 72 h of intensive care unit admission (2C). Recommendations specific to pediatric severe sepsis include: therapy with face mask oxygen, high flow nasal cannula oxygen, or nasopharyngeal continuous PEEP in the presence of respiratory distress and hypoxemia (2C), use of physical examination therapeutic endpoints such as capillary refill (2C); for septic shock associated with hypovolemia, the use of crystalloids or albumin to deliver a bolus of 20 mL/kg of crystalloids (or albumin equivalent) over 5–10 min (2C); more common use of inotropes and vasodilators for low cardiac output septic shock associated with elevated systemic vascular resistance (2C); and use of hydrocortisone only in children with suspected or proven "absolute"' adrenal insufficiency (2C).

Conclusions

Strong agreement existed among a large cohort of international experts regarding many level 1 recommendations for the best care of patients with severe sepsis. Although a significant number of aspects of care have relatively weak support, evidence-based recommendations regarding the acute management of sepsis and septic shock are the foundation of improved outcomes for this important group of critically ill patients.

### Update in sepsis guidelines: what is really new? [^115tq8DD]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2017). Low credibility.

Antimicrobials

The 2016 guidelines recommend administering empiric broad-spectrum antimicrobials that cover all likely pathogens, including bacteria and potentially viruses/fungi (depending on the risk factors of the patient). The initial empiric antibiotic regimen for patients in septic shock should include at least two antibiotics from different classes (combination therapy) directed toward the most likely pathogens. Treatment should be narrowed once the pathogen and its antimicrobial sensitivities are ascertained or when the patient demonstrates clinical improvement. However, patients with bacteremia, neutropenic sepsis or sepsis without shock do not require combination antibiotic therapy. This is a notable difference from the 2012 recommendation that neutropenic sepsis be treated with empiric combination antimicrobials. The authors note, however, that these recommendations do not preclude the use of multiple antibiotics if the goal is to expand the spectrum of pathogens covered.

With respect to antibiotic duration, combination therapy (either empiric or targets) in patients with septic shock should be de-escalated to monotherapy within a few days if clinical improvement or with evidence of infection resolution. This is slightly different than the 2012 guidelines, which recommend that no more than 3–5 days of empiric combination therapy and de-escalation as soon as the responsible organism and susceptibilities are known. Total treatment duration should be 7–10 days for infections with sepsis or septic shock; however, some patients may warrant a prolonged course if they respond slowly to treatment, do not have source control, have bacteremia with Staphylococcus aureus or have immunological deficiencies or fungal/viral infections.

One new recommendation in 2016 is that shorter antibiotic courses are indicated in patients whose sepsis resolves rapidly after source previously, the 2016 authors recommend daily assessments for potential de-escalation of antimicrobials. Failure to normalize procalcitonin levels has recently been shown in a prospective multicenter study to be a significant predictor of mortality. For those who initially appear septic, but do not subsequently have clinical evidence of infection, it can also be used to shorten or discontinue antimicrobial therapy. It is important to note that blood cultures can be negative in up to one-third of all patients suffering from sepsis. Lastly, the campaign does not recommend prophylactic antibiotics for non-infectious inflammatory states such as burns or severe pancreatitis.

### A critical analysis of the literature on time-to-antibiotics in suspected sepsis [^113hQPd4]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

The Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommends immediate antibiotics for all patients with suspected sepsis and septic shock, ideally within 1 hour of recognition. Immediate antibiotic treatment is lifesaving for some patients, but a substantial fraction of patients initially diagnosed with sepsis have noninfectious conditions. Aggressive time-to-antibiotic targets risk promoting antibiotic overuse and antibiotic-associated harms for this subset of the population. An accurate understanding of the precise relationship between time-to-antibiotics and mortality for patients with possible sepsis is therefore critical to finding the best balance between assuring immediate antibiotics for those patients who truly need them versus allowing clinicians some time for rapid investigation to minimize the risk of overtreatment and antibiotic-associated harms for patients who are not infected. More than 30 papers have been published assessing the relationship between time-to-antibiotics and outcomes, almost all of which are observational cohort studies. Most report significant associations but all have important limitations. Key limitations include focusing just on the sickest subset of patients (only patients requiring intensive care and/or patients with septic shock), blending together mortality estimates from patients with very long intervals until antibiotics with patients with shorter intervals and reporting a single blended (and thus inflated) estimate for the average increase in mortality associated with each hour until antibiotics, and failure to control for large potential confounders including patients' presenting signs and symptoms and granular measures of comorbidities and severity of illness. In this study, we elaborate on these potential sources of bias and try to distill a better understanding of what the true relationship between time-to-antibiotics and mortality may be for patients with suspected sepsis or septic shock.

Initial empiric treatment and combination therapy

Given the high prevalence of sepsis and septic shock, intensivists frequently face the decision of initiating antibiotic therapy and selecting the appropriate regimen. Empiric therapy is started when an infection is suspected before microbiology results are available. Once the pathogen has been identified and susceptibility testing performed, the empiric regimen can be tailored to directed or definitive therapy. Concordant therapy refers to an antibiotic choice that is active against the isolated bacterium(a) based on in vitro susceptibility testing. In the ICU, recognizing an infectious process is crucial. No absolute constellation of signs and symptoms or tests can unequivocally diagnose sepsis, thus clinicians must rely on the available clinical information and decide under uncertainty if empiric antibiotics will be beneficial or harmful. Typical symptoms can suggest an infectious syndrome, but older patients with multiple comorbidities often present ambiguously, with a wider differential diagnosis and higher mortality absent appropriate treatment. Up to a third of patients with presumed sepsis may ultimately have a sepsis mimic and potentially experience harm from broad-spectrum antibiotics. Critically ill patients have higher sepsis prevalence than non-ICU patients, therefore increasing the pretest probability of life-threatening infection.

The Surviving Sepsis Campaign and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) SEP-1 measures recommend immediate antibiotics — typically broad spectrum with MRSA and pseudomonal coverage — within 1 to 3 hours of sepsis recognition. Kumar et al described that each hour of delay in starting antibiotics led to a 7.6% decrease in survival for patients with septic shock. Other studies, examining timely antibiotic administration alone or as part of a sepsis care bundle, supported these findings, with the greatest benefit of early antibiotic initiation in patients with septic shock. Seymour et al.'s study of 50,000 patients treated for sepsis found that the 7% increased hourly risk of death was not present in those not requiring vasopressors. This differentiation led IDSA to caution against blanket recommendations for Rapid antibiotics in all sepsis cases, favoring a Rapid evaluation within the first 3−5 hours. This way, uninfected patients may be protected from the side effects of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Even in critically ill patients suspected of having a hospital-acquired infection, too rapid initiation of antibiotics in the absence of shock can result in adverse consequences, including higher mortality.

### Influence of antibiotic therapy with hemodynamic optimization on 30-day mortality among septic shock patients cared for in the prehospital setting [^116Jgu77]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

In order to reduce septic shock mortality, international guidelines recommend early treatment implementation, antibiotic therapy (ABT) and hemodynamic optimisation, within 1-h. This retrospective multicentric study aims to investigate the relationship between prehospital ABT delivered within 1st hour and mean blood pressure (MAP) ≥ 65 mmHg at the end of the prehospital stage, and 30-day mortality among patients with septic shock.

Methods

From May 2016 to December 2021, patients with septic shock requiring pre-hospital Mobile Intensive Care Unit intervention (MICU) were retrospectively analysed. To assess the relationship between 30-day mortality and prehospital ABT delivered within 1st hour and/or MAP ≥ 65 mmHg at the end of the prehospital stage, Inverse Probability Treatment Weighting (IPTW) propensity score method was performed.

Results

Among the 530 patients included, 341 were male gender (64%) with a mean age of 69 ± 15 years. One-hundred and thirty-two patients (25%) patients received prehospital ABT, among which 98 patients (74%) were treated with 3rd generation cephalosporin. Suspected pulmonary, urinary and digestive infections were the cause of sepsis in respectively 43%, 25% and 17%. The 30-day overall mortality was 31%. A significant association was observed between 30-day mortality rate and (i) ABT administration within the first hour: RRa = 0.14 [0.04–0.55], (ii) ABT administration within the first hour associated with a MAP ≥ 65 mmHg: RRa = 0.08 [0.02–0.37] and (iii) ABT administration within the first hour in the prehospital setting associated with a MAP < 65 mmHg at the end of the prehospital stage: RRa = 0.75 [0.45–0.85]. Patients who received prehospital ABT after the first hour have also a 30-day mortality rate decrease: RRa = 0.87 [0.57–0.99], whereas patients who did not received ABT had an increased 30-day mortality rate: RRa = 2.36 [1.89–2.95].

Conclusion

In this study, we showed that pre-hospital ABT within the first hour and MAP ≥ 65 mmHg at the end of prehospital stage are both associated with 30-day mortality decrease among patients suffering from septic shock cared for by a MICU. Further prospective studies are needed to confirm these preliminary results.

### Early versus late pre-intensive care unit admission broad spectrum antibiotics for severe sepsis in adults [^113dexyg]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Severe sepsis and septic shock have recently emerged as particularly acute and lethal challenges amongst critically ill patients presenting to the emergency department (ED). There are no existing data on the current practices of management of patients with severe sepsis comparing early versus late administration of appropriate broad spectrum antibiotics as part of the early goal-directed therapy that is commenced in the first few hours of presentation.

Objectives

To assess the difference in outcomes with early compared to late administration of antibiotics in patients with severe sepsis in the pre-intensive care unit (ICU) admission period. We defined early as within one hour of presentation to the ED.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2009); MEDLINE (1990 to February 2010); EMBASE (1990 to February 2010); and ISI web of Science (February 2010). We also searched for relevant ongoing trials in specific websites such as www.controlled-trials.com; www.clinicalstudyresults.org; and www.update-software.com. We searched the reference lists of articles. There were no constraints based on language or publication status.

Selection Criteria

We planned to include randomized controlled trials of early versus late broad spectrum antibiotics in adult patients with severe sepsis in the ED, prior to admission to the intensive care unit.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed articles for inclusion.

Main Results

We found no studies that satisfied the inclusion criteria.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on this review we are unable to make a recommendation on the early or late use of broad spectrum antibiotics in adult patients with severe sepsis in the ED pre-ICU admission. There is a need to do large prospective double blinded randomized controlled trials on the efficacy of early (within one hour) versus late broad spectrum antibiotics in adult severe sepsis patients. Since it makes sense to start antibiotics as soon as possible in this group of seriously ill patients, administering such antibiotics earlier as opposed to later is based on anecdotal suboptimal evidence.

Severe sepsis and septic shock have great relevance to Emergency Medicine physicians because of their high prevalence, morbidity, and mortality. Treatment is time-sensitive, depends on early identification risk stratification, and has the potential to significantly improve patient outcomes. In this article, we review the pathophysiology of, and evidence basis for, the emergency department management of severe sepsis and septic shock.

### Antibiotic therapy in patients with septic shock [^1168YUbb]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2011). Low credibility.

The management of a patient with severe sepsis is first to diagnose the infection, to collect samples immediately after diagnosis and to initiate promptly broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment. The choice of empirical antimicrobial therapy should be based on host characteristics, site of infection, local ecology and the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the antibiotics. In severe infection, guidelines recommend the use of a combination of antibiotics. After results of cultures are obtained, treatment should be re-evaluated to either de-escalate or escalate the antibiotics. This is associated with optimal costs, decreased incidence of superinfection and reduced development of antimicrobial resistance. All these steps should be based on written protocols, and compliance to these protocols should be monitored continuously in order to detect violations and implement corrective procedures.

### Initial antimicrobial management of sepsis: increased prehospital blood lactate levels for identifying sicker patients who may benefit from prehospital antibiotic therapy initiation [^115RmMVr]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

To the Editor:

We read with great interest the recent review published in the Journal by Niederman et al. emphasizing that immediate, empiric, broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy to severe sepsis and/or shock patients reduces mortality, despite the fact that it can lead to antimicrobial overuse and resistance; and should be accompanied by an early de-escalation and antimicrobial stewardship.

Early sepsis recognition and appropriate treatment initiation, mainly antibiotic therapy and hemodynamic optimization, are cornerstones for management of septic patients, especially the sicker ones, to improve prognosis. As underlined by Niederman et al. sepsis occurs commonly outside the hospital environment in 70% of cases, requiring either ambulatory treatment or hospital admission for the most severe form. Nevertheless, for the latter, antibiotic therapy and hemodynamic optimization will only be initiated in the emergency department. With the exception of the most severe cases for which the diagnosis is obvious, e.g. purpura fulminans or patients with low blood pressure and skin mottling in a sepsis context, sepsis diagnose, and severity assessment remain a daily challenge in the prehospital field. For those patients, we suggest using the point of care (POC) lactate measurement. On the one hand, blood lactate level is a criterion for septic shock diagnosis and is associated with poorer outcome among septic shock patients. On the other hand, POC lactate measurement devices have been validated in the prehospital environment. Therefore, we suggest that a prehospital sepsis severity assessment strategy based on blood lactate level POC assessment may be helpful in identifying the sicker septic patients, i.e. those for whom, in order to reduce sepsis related mortality, prehospital antibiotic therapy instauration cannot wait until hospital admission and should be initiated from the point of prehospital care.

The rationale notes that antimicrobial exposure is linked to the development of antimicrobial resistance and efforts to reduce both the number of antibiotics administered and their spectrum.

Regarding specific circumstances for sepsis and septic shock, more specifically with respect to neonates, management, AAP 2018 guidelines recommend to administer ampicillin plus gentamicin as the first choice for empirical therapy for early-onset sepsis, as this regimen is effective against group B streptococcus, most other streptococcal and enterococcal species, and L. monocytogenes. Recognize that although two-thirds of E. coli early-onset sepsis isolates and most other Gram-negative early-onset sepsis isolates are resistant to ampicillin, the majority remain sensitive to gentamicin. Consider administering additional broad-spectrum agents in term infants who are critically ill until appropriate culture results are known.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of sepsis and septic shock: 2016 [^112JPJMT]. Intensive Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide an update to "Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines for Management of Sepsis and Septic Shock: 2012".

Design

A consensus committee of 55 international experts representing 25 international organizations was convened. Nominal groups were assembled at key international meetings (for those committee members attending the conference). A formal conflict-of-interest (COI) policy was developed at the onset of the process and enforced throughout. A stand-alone meeting was held for all panel members in December 2015. Teleconferences and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee served as an integral part of the development.

Methods

The panel consisted of five sections: hemodynamics, infection, adjunctive therapies, metabolic, and ventilation. Population, intervention, comparison, and outcomes (PICO) questions were reviewed and updated as needed, and evidence profiles were generated. Each subgroup generated a list of questions, searched for best available evidence, and then followed the principles of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system to assess the quality of evidence from high to very low, and to formulate recommendations as strong or weak, or best practice statement when applicable.

Results

The Surviving Sepsis Guideline panel provided 93 statements on early management and resuscitation of patients with sepsis or septic shock. Overall, 32 were strong recommendations, 39 were weak recommendations, and 18 were best-practice statements. No recommendation was provided for four questions.

Conclusions

Substantial agreement exists among a large cohort of international experts regarding many strong recommendations for the best care of patients with sepsis. Although a significant number of aspects of care have relatively weak support, evidence-based recommendations regarding the acute management of sepsis and septic shock are the foundation of improved outcomes for these critically ill patients with high mortality.

### Prehospital bundle of care based on antibiotic therapy and hemodynamic optimization is associated with a 30-day mortality decrease in patients with septic shock [^112VTp2s]. Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

This study aims to investigate the association between the 30-day mortality in patients with septic shock (SS) and a prehospital bundle of care completion, antibiotic therapy administration, and hemodynamic optimization defined as a fluid expansion of at least 10 mL·kg⁻¹·hr⁻¹.

Design

To assess the association between prehospital BUndle of Care (BUC) completion and 30-day mortality, the inverse probability treatment weighting (IPTW) propensity method was performed.

Setting

International guidelines recommend early treatment implementation in order to reduce SS mortality. More than one single treatment, a bundle of care, including antibiotic therapy and hemodynamic optimization, is more efficient.

Patients

From May 2016 to March 2021, patients with SS requiring prehospital mobile ICU (mICU) intervention were retrospectively analyzed.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

Among the 529 patients with SS requiring action by the mICU enrolled in this study, 354 (67%) were analyzed. Presumed pulmonary, digestive, and urinary infections were the cause of the SS in 49%, 25%, and 13% of the cases, respectively. The overall 30-day mortality was 32%. Seventy-one patients (20%) received prehospital antibiotic therapy and fluid expansion. Log binomial regression weighted with IPTW resulted in a significant association between 30-day mortality and prehospital BUC completion (respiratory rate [RR] of 0.56 [0.33–0.89]; p = 0.02 and adjusted RR 0.52 [0.27–0.93]; p = 0.03).

Conclusions

A prehospital bundle of care, based on antibiotic therapy and hemodynamic optimization, is associated with a 30-day mortality decrease among patients suffering from SS cared for by an mICU.

### Severe sepsis and septic shock in the emergency department [^111GgLT4]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Increased attention has focused recently on the acute management of severe sepsis and septic shock, conditions that represent the end-stage systemic deterioration of overwhelming infection. Clinical trials have identified new therapies and management approaches that, when applied early, appear to reduce mortality. Practice guidelines have been advanced by critical care societies, and many of the proposed interventions involve therapies other than antimicrobials directed at hemodynamic resuscitation or addressing adverse effects of the inflammatory cascade. Although many emergency departments (EDs) are now adopting treatment protocols for sepsis that are based on published treatment guidelines, recent research calls many of the initial recommendations into question, and validation trials of some of these approaches are ongoing. This article reviews the initial evaluation and treatment considerations of sepsis in the ED setting.

### Time-to-antibiotics and clinical outcomes in patients with sepsis and septic shock: a prospective nationwide multicenter cohort study [^112NEHMR]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sepsis is a life-threatening syndrome characterized by physiological, pathological, and biochemical abnormalities that are induced by infection and associated with multiorgan failure and high mortality. Compelling evidence has shown that delay in the initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy is a risk factor for mortality; therefore, administration of antibiotics is recognized as a key component in the early treatment of sepsis. In this regard, antibiotic administration has been included in the hour-1 bundle of the previous Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines, and the implementation of the hour-1 bundle was highly recommended to reduce mortality and morbidity. Indeed, several multinational studies reported that compliance to the Surviving Sepsis Campaign bundle was associated with mortality in patients with sepsis.

Nevertheless, considerable controversy still exists regarding the association between the time of antibiotic administration and clinical outcomes in patients with sepsis/septic shock, and whether the administration of antibiotics within 1 h could improve outcomes in patients with sepsis. The Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends that the aggressive administration of antibiotics within 1 h might not be beneficial in sepsis and may result in unintentional exposure to broad-spectrum antibiotics. The American College of Emergency Physicians also noted a lack of evidence to recommend a strict time threshold for antibiotic administration in cases with sepsis. In addition, organizing timely administration of antibiotics requires considerable effort and resources, and it may not be feasible to administer antibiotics within 1 h of presentation in all patients with sepsis.

Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the impact of time-to-antibiotics on in-hospital mortality in patients with sepsis. Furthermore, subgroup analysis was performed to assess whether the effect of time-to-antibiotics was significantly different between the sepsis and septic shock groups.

### Adequacy of probabilistic prehospital antibiotic therapy for septic shock [^117JpQA3]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Guidelines on sepsis management recommend early recognition, diagnosis and treatment, especially early antibiotic therapy (ABT) administration in order to reduce septic shock (SS) mortality. However, the adequacy of probabilistic prehospital ABT remains unknown.

Methods

From May 2016 to March 2021, all consecutive patients with SS cared for by a prehospital mICU intervention were retrospectively analyzed.

Results

Among 386 patients retrospectively analyzed, 119 (33%) received probabilistic prehospital ABT, among which 74% received a 3rd generation cephalosporin: 31% cefotaxime and 42% ceftriaxone. No patient had a serious adverse effect related to ABT administration. Overall mortality rate on day-30 was 29%. Among the 119 patients with prehospital ABT, bacteriological identification was obtained for 81 (68%) patients with adequate prehospital ABT for 65 patients (80%) of which 10 (15%) deceased on day-30. Conversely, among the 16 (20%) patients with inadequate prehospital ABT, 9 patients (56%) were deceased on day-30. Prehospital adequate ABT was significantly different between alive and deceased patients on day-30 (p = 4.10–3). After propensity score matching, a significant association between adequate prehospital ABT administration and day-30 mortality was observed (aOR = 0.09 [0.01–0.47]). Inverse probability treatment weighting with multivariable logistic regression reported a day-30 mortality decrease in the adequate prehospital ABT group: aOR = 0.70 [0.53–0.93].

Conclusions

Among SS cared for by a mICU, probabilistic prehospital ABT is adequate most of the time and associated with a day-30 mortality decrease. Further prospective studies are needed to confirm these results and the weight of prehospital ABT in the prehospital bundle of care for SS.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America position paper: recommended revisions to the national severe sepsis and septic shock early management bundle (SEP-1) sepsis quality measure [^116Nh8HK]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock Early Management Bundle (SEP-1) measure has appropriately established sepsis as a national priority. However, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA and five additional endorsing societies) is concerned about SEP-1's potential to drive antibiotic overuse because it does not account for the high rate of sepsis overdiagnosis and encourages aggressive antibiotics for all patients with possible sepsis, regardless of the certainty of diagnosis or severity of illness. IDSA is also concerned that SEP-1's complex "time zero" definition is not evidence-based and is prone to inter-observer variation. In this position paper, IDSA outlines several recommendations aimed at reducing the risk of unintended consequences of SEP-1 while maintaining focus on its evidence-based elements. IDSA's core recommendation is to limit SEP-1 to septic shock, for which the evidence supporting the benefit of immediate antibiotics is greatest. Prompt empiric antibiotics are often appropriate for suspected sepsis without shock, but IDSA believes there is too much heterogeneity and difficulty defining this population, uncertainty about the presence of infection, and insufficient data on the necessity of immediate antibiotics to support a mandatory treatment standard for all patients in this category. IDSA believes guidance on managing possible sepsis without shock is more appropriate for guidelines that can delineate the strengths and limitations of supporting evidence and allow clinicians discretion in applying specific recommendations to individual patients. Removing sepsis without shock from SEP-1 will mitigate the risk of unnecessary antibiotic prescribing for noninfectious syndromes, simplify data abstraction, increase measure reliability, and focus attention on the population most likely to benefit from immediate empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics.

### Prehospital treatment of sepsis: what really makes the "golden hour" golden? [^114Xxbjy]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

In summary, we believe that the findings of Seymour and colleagues are more likely a representation of improvements in downstream processes of care rather than fluid administration or IV access per se. As a result, we believe these data actually have much broader implications. The recognition of severe sepsis is crucial to the early diagnosis and management of sepsis, and the prehospital setting is no exception. Prehospital personnel can potentially play a vital role in improving outcomes by early identification and initiation of treatment, improving processes of care. While severe sepsis remains a unique and challenging disease state, optimal outcomes and treatment plans require a team approach incorporating nurses, physicians, and prehospital personnel, with education and training on the recognition and early identification of severe sepsis and septic shock.

### Advanced life support. initial management of sepsis and septic shock in adults [^112SE8XC]. REDCROSS (2025). High credibility.

Advanced life support — initial management of sepsis and septic shock in adults (Red Cross Guidelines) specifies antimicrobial timing and empiric coverage as follows: For adults with a high likelihood of sepsis, with or without shock, antimicrobials should be administered immediately, ideally within 1 hour of recognition of septic shock; for adults with shock and possible sepsis, antimicrobials should be administered immediately, ideally within 1 hour of recognition; for adults with possible sepsis without shock, it is reasonable to rapidly evaluate the patient and if concern for infection persists, administer antimicrobials within 3 hours from the time when sepsis was first recognized; for adults with sepsis or septic shock who are at high risk for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), empiric antimicrobials with coverage for MRSA should be initiated, while for those at low risk for MRSA, it is reasonable to not include empiric antimicrobial coverage for MRSA; for adults with sepsis or septic shock who are at high risk of multidrug resistant (MDR) organisms, use two antimicrobials with gram-negative coverage for empiric treatment, and for those at low risk of MDR organisms, use one gram-negative antimicrobial for empiric treatment.

### Prehospital antibiotics in the ambulance for sepsis: a multicentre, open label, randomised trial [^111gc1gV]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

Emergency medical services (EMS) personnel have already made substantial contributions to improving care for patients with time-dependent illnesses, such as trauma and myocardial infarction. Patients with sepsis could also benefit from timely prehospital care.

Methods

After training EMS personnel in recognising sepsis, we did a randomised controlled open-label trial in ten large regional ambulance services serving 34 secondary and tertiary care hospitals in the Netherlands. We compared the effects of early administration of antibiotics in the ambulance with usual care. Eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1) using block-randomisation with blocks of size 4 to the intervention (open-label intravenous ceftriaxone 2000 mg in addition to usual care) or usual care (fluid resuscitation and supplementary oxygen). Randomisation was stratified per region. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality at 28 days and analysis was by intention to treat. To assess the effect of training, we determined the average time to antibiotics (TTA) in the emergency department and recognition of sepsis by EMS personnel before and after training. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01988428.

Findings

2698 patients were enrolled between June 30, 2014, and June 26, 2016. 2672 patients were included in the intention-to-treat analysis: 1535 in the intervention group and 1137 in the usual care group. The intervention group received antibiotics a median of 26 min (IQR 19–34) before arriving at the emergency department. In the usual care group, median TTA after arriving at the emergency department was 70 min (IQR 36–128), compared with 93 min (IQR 39–140) before EMS personnel training (p = 0.142). At day 28, 120 (8%) patients had died in the intervention group and 93 (8%) had died in the usual care group (relative risk 0.95, 95% CI 0.74–1.24). 102 (7%) patients in the intervention group and 119 (10%) in the usual care group were re-admitted to hospital within 28 days (p = 0.0004). Seven mild allergic reactions occurred, none of which could be attributed to ceftriaxone.

Interpretation

In patients with varying severity of sepsis, EMS personnel training improved early recognition and care in the whole acute care chain. However, giving antibiotics in the ambulance did not lead to improved survival, regardless of illness severity.

### The early antibiotic therapy in septic patients – milestone or sticking point? [^114yBDo1]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Rationale for early antibiotic therapy

Worldwide, the annual prevalence of sepsis is estimated at 19 million cases. The mortality rates in severe sepsis were reduced to 20% to 30% because of advances in training, recognition, surveillance, monitoring, and rapid initial antibiotic therapy and organ support. The most recent update of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines was published in 2013. A consensus committee provided valuable and clear recommendations on treatment of sepsis and septic shock (Table 1). One of the main focuses is the administration of a broad-spectrum antibiotic (Table 2). It is recommended that antimicrobials be administrated within the first hour of recognition of septic shock and severe sepsis without septic shock. Moreover, it is recommended that initial anti-infective therapy include one or more drugs that have activity against all likely pathogens and penetrate in adequate concentrations into the target tissue. The selected antibiotic strategy should anticipate the site of infection, medical and culture history, and local microbial susceptibility results, all in an emergency situation.

### Does early goal-directed therapy decrease mortality compared with standard care in patients with septic shock? [^114tKhBL]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Current international guidelines for the treatment of patients with severe sepsis and septic shock recommend that patients receive targeted care to various physiologic endpoints, thereby optimizing tissue perfusion and oxygenation. These recommendations are primarily derived from a protocol published > 15 years ago, which was viewed by many as complex and was therefore not widely adopted. Instead, many emergency physicians focused on the administration of early antibiotics, source control, aggressive fluid resuscitation, vasoactive medications as needed to maintain mean arterial blood pressure, and careful monitoring of these patients. The primary goal of this literature search was to determine if there is a mortality benefit to the early goal-directed protocol recommended by current international sepsis guidelines compared to current usual care.

Methods

A MEDLINE literature search was performed for studies published between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2015. Studies were limited to the English language, human randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, prospective trials, and retrospective cohort trials that met specific keyword search criteria. Case reports, case series, and review articles were excluded. All selected articles then underwent a structured review by the authors.

Results

Seven thousand four hundred twenty studies were initially screened; after the final application of inclusion and exclusion criteria, 10 studies were formally analyzed. Each study then underwent a rigorous review and evaluation from which a formal recommendation was made.

Conclusion

There is no difference in mortality between current usual care and the goal-directed approach recommended by current international guidelines for patients with severe sepsis and septic shock.

### Adjunctive treatments for the management of septic shock-a narrative review of the current evidence [^116qV64H]. Anaesthesia (2021). Medium credibility.

Septic shock is a leading cause of death and morbidity worldwide. The cornerstones of management include prompt identification of sepsis, early initiation of antibiotic therapy, adequate fluid resuscitation and organ support. Over the past two decades, there have been considerable improvements in our understanding of the pathophysiology of sepsis and the host response, including regulation of inflammation, endothelial disruption and impaired immunity. This has offered opportunities for innovative adjunctive treatments such as vitamin C, corticosteroids and beta-blockers. Some of these approaches have shown promising results in early phase trials in humans, while others, such as corticosteroids, have been tested in large, international, multicentre randomised controlled trials. Contemporary guidelines make a weak recommendation for the use of corticosteroids to reduce mortality in sepsis and septic shock. Vitamin C, despite showing initial promise in observational studies, has so far not been shown to be clinically effective in randomised trials. Beta-blocker therapy may have beneficial cardiac and non-cardiac effects in septic shock, but there is currently insufficient evidence to recommend their use for this condition. The results of ongoing randomised trials are awaited. Crucial to reducing heterogeneity in the trials of new sepsis treatments will be the concept of enrichment, which refers to the purposive selection of patients with clinical and biological characteristics that are likely to be responsive to the intervention being tested.

### Early care of adults with suspected sepsis in the Emergency department and out-of-hospital environment: a consensus-based task force Report [^111Dk1ff]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Sepsis antimicrobials — timing and spectrum: We support early antibiotics once sepsis is diagnosed or deemed likely, with the strongest support for initial intravenous antibiotics in those with suspected diagnosis of septic shock — that is, patients with infection and any hypotension or hypoperfusion; shorter time to antibiotics is preferred, but the precise time frame to optimally support outcomes remains to be defined, and antivirals are less clearly time sensitive in the earliest phases of disease. For sepsis patients without an identified pathogen, we recommend initiation of broad-spectrum antibiotics with activity against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria according to local susceptibility patterns. Most sepsis patients receive initial doses of antimicrobials in the ED prior to the availability of culture results, and clinicians should base the initial selection of antimicrobials on the most likely and most harmful potential pathogens rather than targeting a specific pathogen, unless the clinical presentation directs such a focused approach; narrow-spectrum therapy is uncommon and should not be anticipated in usual practice. Whereas some data suggest that an earlier administration of antibiotics is associated with better survival, other data suggest that small variations in the timing of a first dose of antibiotics are not associated with mortality differences; we agree that once the diagnosis of sepsis is established, rapid and comprehensive therapy — not just antibiotic administration — is optimal, but the current data do not recommend a singular time.

### Update in sepsis guidelines: what is really new? [^114sswqQ]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2017). Low credibility.

The clinical recommendations for managing sepsis have also recently been updated. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) published their initial clinical practice guidelines (CPG) for the management of severe sepsis and septic shock in 2004. Updated versions were published in 2008,2012and most recently in 2016. The 2016 CPG is largely similar to the 2012 version, but there are differences in recommendations in a number of categories, including initial resuscitation parameters, vasopressor selection, antibiotic selection and ventilation. After the release of the Sepsis-3 definition revisions, the SCCM SSC released a practice guideline update to provide clinical context to the guidelines and help providers expeditiously screen, identify and treat patients with sepsis. In this update, they reiterate adherence to the campaign recommendations from 2012. Providers should 'continue to use signs and symptoms of infection to promote early identification' and those with suspected infection should begin immediate management to include 'obtaining blood and other cultures… administering tailored antibiotics as appropriate, and simultaneously obtain laboratory results'.

### Beyond septic shock: who else requires immediate antibiotics? [^116u9zSX]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Landmark studies published almost 20 years ago documented strong associations between time to antibiotic therapy and mortality in critically ill patients, most of whom had septic shock. These findings catalyzed early versions of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign that recommended administering antibiotics ≤ 1 hour after the diagnosis of sepsis with any acute organ dysfunction, not just septic shock. Some state and national quality metrics further extended this guidance, requiring rapid administration of antibiotic therapy for all patients with suspected sepsis or septic shock.

Sepsis, however, is a broad and heterogeneous syndrome that encompasses a wide range of inciting organisms, sites of infection, and patterns of organ dysfunctions. These differences are magnified by host factors, including extremes of age, comorbidities, and immune function. The manifestations of sepsis, prognoses, and the impact of therapy are very different for a young and healthy host with bacterial pneumonia compared with a geriatric patient with cancer complicated by neutropenia and disseminated fungal infection.

The latest version of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines recognizes some of this variability. The 2021 guidelines suggest that patients be stratified by certainty of infection and severity of illness. Specifically, they advise antibiotic therapy ≤ 1 hour after recognition in all patients with possible septic shock and all patients with definite or probable sepsis without shock. In patients with possible sepsis without shock, however, in whom the diagnosis of infection is uncertain and the severity of illness is lesser, they suggest the diagnosis be clarified before antibiotic therapy is administered to minimize unnecessary antibiotic agent use and unintended harms to the individual and the population. Clarifying steps can include assessing the patient's response to the treatment of noninfectious conditions and comorbidities (e.g. fluids, diuresis, bronchodilators, heart rate control, pain control, opioid antagonists, anticoagulation) and/or obtaining additional diagnostic studies (e.g. cross-sectional imaging, respiratory viral panels) and administering antimicrobial agents only if the concern for infection persists for > 3 hours.

Regarding medical management for sepsis and septic shock, more specifically with respect to antimicrobial therapy (choice of antibiotic agent), SSC 2021 guidelines recommend to avoid using two (rather than one) Gram-negative agents for empiric treatment in adult patients with sepsis or septic shock and low risk for multidrug-resistant organisms.

### Initial antimicrobial management of sepsis [^111W8GHj]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The management of suspected sepsis requires thoughtful and individualized care. Initial empiric therapy should be immediate for those with a high likelihood of infection, severe illness and/or shock. Specific empiric antimicrobial therapy should be chosen with consideration of the likely site of infection, common pathogens for these sites, and with modification made by consideration of patient-specific risk factors for resistance and knowledge of local microbiology. While timely and appropriate therapy is necessary to reduce mortality, it must be accompanied by a commitment to de-escalate once we get culture and serial clinical and laboratory data, since indiscriminate use of broad-spectrum empiric therapy is a driving force for antimicrobial resistance. Key recommendations for management are summarized in Table 1.

Empiric double coverage of gram-negative bacilli is most important in patients at high risk for resistant organisms with severe illness, particularly septic shock, and in the directed/targeted phase, once causative agent(s) and susceptibilities are known, sustained double gram-negative coverage is not necessary except possibly for patients with highly resistant organisms with no proven safe and efficacious therapeutic option; the overall quality of evidence was very low.

How can we improve the recognition of sepsis?

Anthony Delaney (Figure 3)

Sepsis remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide. While there has been a measureable reduction in mortality over recent years, the underlying reasons for this decline in mortality are not entirely clear. More than 100 trials of specific treatments designed to improve mortality in sepsis have failed to demonstrate a mortality benefit. It is possible that further research will lead to a discovery of a novel agent capable of altering the complex interaction between the specific pathogenic mechanisms of various infective agents, the generic host inflammatory reaction to infection, and the pathophysiological response mediated by each individuals' co-morbidities, in a positive fashion, although such a therapy would appear remote from clinical practice at this point in time. As described in the previous section, the EGDT resuscitation strategy changed the landscape in the management of the early stages of patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. Although subsequent trials have not confirmed the benefits of this specific resuscitation algorithm, it is considered that early recognition of sepsis and early application of the fundamental principles of the treatment of sepsis, namely resuscitation, antibiotics, and source control, may have contributed to the gradual decline in mortality over recent times. One of the major challenges facing clinicians is to identify and recognize patients with sepsis and impending organ dysfunction, in the pre-hospital setting, in the emergency department, and for patients who deteriorate in hospital.

### Implementation of earlier antibiotic administration in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock in Japan: a descriptive analysis of a prospective observational study [^113oGiUJ]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Time to antibiotic administration is a key element in sepsis care, and the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) guidelines (2004, 2008, 2012, and 2016) have repeatedly recommended initiating empirical broad-spectrum therapy within 3 h from triage or sepsis recognition. However, the updated 2018 SSC guidelines recommend a 1-h window for antibiotic administration following the recognition of sepsis as a reasonable approach; this update has been significantly debated, and it remains controversial. Although it would be impossible to argue against appropriate and timely antibiotic therapy for sepsis considering its time-sensitive nature, sepsis is different from other emergent conditions such as acute coronary syndrome, stroke, or trauma. Specifically, its recognition by healthcare providers within 1 h of presentation may be difficult to achieve in real-life settings because of vague presenting symptoms and the fact that its exact onset is mostly unobservable. Further, the only randomized controlled trial (RCT) that evaluated early antibiotic use in patients with suspected infection failed to reduce mortality, although this was in the pre-hospital setting.

We prospectively evaluated the characteristics and management of patients with severe sepsis in the Focused Outcomes Research in Emergency Care in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Sepsis, and Trauma (FORECAST) study in Japan. We then used the FORECAST database to describe the association between time to antibiotic administration and outcomes in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock treated in real-world clinical settings.

### Surviving sepsis: a guide to the guidelines [^115LHQs5]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

The revised Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) guidelines for the management of severe sepsis and septic shock have recently been published. These guidelines represent the end product of an intense process and provide a template approach to the early resuscitation and support of patients with sepsis, based on a synthesis of evidence that has been shown to improve the outcome of the septic patient. The SSC guidelines arose from a recognition that care of the septic patient was suboptimal for at least three reasons. First, the entity of sepsis was frequently not diagnosed in a timely fashion, allowing the process to evolve into a life-threatening syndrome of major physiologic organ system dysfunction. Secondly, even when sepsis was recognized, the urgency of treatment was underappreciated - and so haemodynamic resuscitation was tentative, and the administration of effective antibiotic therapy was often delayed. Finally, treatment was often suboptimal, and failed to take advantage of emerging insights into optimal approaches to patient management. The revised guidelines are far from perfect, but they represent the best available synthesis of contemporary knowledge in this area and as such should be promoted.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of sepsis and septic shock 2021 [^114rvATp]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Sepsis and septic shock — procalcitonin-guided discontinuation of antimicrobials is supported by evidence from 14 randomized controlled trials (RCTs; n = 4,499 patients) assessing use of procalcitonin to guide duration, with a meta-analysis reporting improved mortality (RR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.80 to 0.99) and no effect on length of stay in ICU or hospital; antibiotic exposure was consistently lower though in many trials the total duration of therapy was still 7 days or longer, and the overall quality of evidence was judged to be low. Based on apparent benefit and no obvious undesirable effects, we suggest using procalcitonin along with clinical evaluation to decide when to discontinue antimicrobials in adults with an initial diagnosis of sepsis or septic shock and adequate source control, if the optimal duration of therapy is unclear and if procalcitonin is available.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of severe sepsis and septic shock: 2008 [^111pLVtd]. Intensive Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide an update to the original Surviving Sepsis Campaign clinical management guidelines, "Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines for management of severe sepsis and septic shock", published in 2004.

Design

Modified Delphi method with a consensus conference of 55 international experts, several subsequent meetings of subgroups and key individuals, teleconferences, and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee. This process was conducted independently of any industry funding.

Methods

We used the GRADE system to guide assessment of quality of evidence from high (A) to very low (D) and to determine the strength of recommendations. A strong recommendation indicates that an intervention's desirable effects clearly outweigh its undesirable effects (risk, burden, cost), or clearly do not. Weak recommendations indicate that the tradeoff between desirable and undesirable effects is less clear. The grade of strong or weak is considered of greater clinical importance than a difference in letter level of quality of evidence. In areas without complete agreement, a formal process of resolution was developed and applied. Recommendations are grouped into those directly targeting severe sepsis, recommendations targeting general care of the critically ill patient that are considered high priority in severe sepsis, and pediatric considerations.

Results

Key recommendations, listed by category, include: early goal-directed resuscitation of the septic patient during the first 6 hrs after recognition (1C); blood cultures prior to antibiotic therapy (1C); imaging studies performed promptly to confirm potential source of infection (1C); administration of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy within 1 hr of diagnosis of septic shock (1B) and severe sepsis without septic shock (1D); reassessment of antibiotic therapy with microbiology and clinical data to narrow coverage, when appropriate (1C); a usual 7–10 days of antibiotic therapy guided by clinical response (1D); source control with attention to the balance of risks and benefits of the chosen method (1C); administration of either crystalloid or colloid fluid resuscitation (1B); fluid challenge to restore mean circulating filling pressure (1C); reduction in rate of fluid administration with rising filing pressures and no improvement in tissue perfusion (1D); vasopressor preference for norepinephrine or dopamine to maintain an initial target of mean arterial pressure ≥ 65 mm Hg (1C); dobutamine inotropic therapy when cardiac output remains low despite fluid resuscitation and combined inotropic/vasopressor therapy (1C); stress-dose steroid therapy given only in septic shock after blood pressure is identified to be poorly responsive to fluid and vasopressor therapy (2C); recombinant activated protein C in patients with severe sepsis and clinical assessment of high risk for death (2B except 2C for post-operative patients). In the absence of tissue hypoperfusion, coronary artery disease, or acute hemorrhage, target a hemoglobin of 7–9 g/dL (1B); a low tidal volume (1B) and limitation of inspiratory plateau pressure strategy (1C) for acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); application of at least a minimal amount of positive end-expiratory pressure in acute lung injury (1C); head of bed elevation in mechanically ventilated patients unless contraindicated (1B); avoiding routine use of pulmonary artery catheters in ALI/ARDS (1A); to decrease days of mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stay, a conservative fluid strategy for patients with established ALI/ARDS who are not in shock (1C); protocols for weaning and sedation/analgesia (1B); using either intermittent bolus sedation or continuous infusion sedation with daily interruptions or lightening (1B); avoidance of neuromuscular blockers, if at all possible (1B); institution of glycemic control (1B) targeting a blood glucose < 150 mg/dL after initial stabilization (2C); equivalency of continuous veno-veno hemofiltration or intermittent hemodialysis (2B); prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (1A); use of stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent upper GI bleeding using H2 blockers (1A) or proton pump inhibitors (1B); and consideration of limitation of support where appropriate (1D). Recommendations specific to pediatric severe sepsis include: greater use of physical examination therapeutic end points (2C); dopamine as the first drug of choice for hypotension (2C); steroids only in children with suspected or proven adrenal insufficiency (2C); a recommendation against the use of recombinant activated protein C in children (1B).

Conclusion

There was strong agreement among a large cohort of international experts regarding many level 1 recommendations for the best current care of patients with severe sepsis. Evidenced-based recommendations regarding the acute management of sepsis and septic shock are the first step toward improved outcomes for this important group of critically ill patients.

### Does early and appropriate antibiotic administration improve mortality in emergency department patients with severe sepsis or septic shock? [^1125WEa7]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Severe sepsis and septic shock remain significant public health concerns. Appropriate emergency department management includes early recognition, hemodynamic resuscitation, source control, and prompt antibiotic administration. Current international guidelines strongly recommend administration of early and appropriate antibiotics for patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. Interestingly, a recent Cochrane Review found insufficient evidence to provide a similar recommendation on antibiotic administration. The goal of this literature search was to systematically review the available literature on early and appropriate antimicrobial therapy and provide emergency physicians an evidence-based approach to antibiotic therapy for septic patients.

Methods

Four PubMed searches were completed to identify abstracts of relevant interest. We limited studies to those completed in adult humans that were composed in English between 2005 and 2015. Included studies were randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, prospective trials, and retrospective cohort studies. These studies were identified by a rigorous search methodology. No review articles, case series, or case reports were included. Predefined criteria were used to evaluate the quality and appropriateness of selected articles as part of a structured review.

Results

A total of 1552 abstracts were evaluated for inclusion. After the review of these studies, 14 were included for formal review. The authors then systematically evaluated each study, which formed the basis for this clinical statement.

Conclusions

Patients with severe sepsis and septic shock should receive early and appropriate antibiotics in the emergency department. Patients with septic shock who received appropriate antimicrobial therapy within 1 h of recognition had the greatest benefit in mortality.

### Considerations for empiric antimicrobial therapy in sepsis and septic shock in an era of antimicrobial resistance [^114h6N1R]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Patients with sepsis present across a spectrum of infection sites and severity of illnesses requiring complex decision making at the bedside as to when prompt antibiotics are indicated and which regimen is warranted. Many hemodynamically stable patients with sepsis and low acuity of illness may benefit from further work up before initiating therapy, whereas patients with septic shock warrant emergent broad-spectrum antibiotics. The precise empiric regimen is determined by assessing patient and epidemiological risk factors, likely source of infection based on presenting signs and symptoms, and severity of illness. Hospitals should implement quality improvement measures to aid in the rapid and accurate diagnosis of septic patients and to ensure antibiotics are given to patients in an expedited fashion after antibiotic order.

### Recommendations for infection management in patients with sepsis and septic shock in resource-limited settings [^113aHge2]. Intensive Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Large variations in disease etiology and high rates of antimicrobial resistance combined with restricted choice of antibiotics and limited microbiological data pose significant challenges in the management of septic patients in resource-limited settings. Increased use of combination therapy and broad spectrum antibiotics risks increasing antimicrobial resistance. Enhanced surveillance necessitates better collaboration between stakeholders and improved microbiological facilities, which in turn requires significant investment. However, newer technologies which negate the need for specialist staff and equipment may become more available. This would not only improve the management of individual patients but, by providing high-quality epidemiological data, may help combat the global threat of antimicrobial resistance.
