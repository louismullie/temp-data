## Question

When prescribing NSAIDS, a complete drug history should be conducted as NSAIDs interact with these drugs? Omeprazole? Oral contraceptives? Diphenhydramine? Or warfarin?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which medication — omeprazole, oral contraceptives, diphenhydramine, or warfarin — has a significant interaction with NSAIDs that requires a complete drug history before prescribing. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacology of NSAIDs and their principal safety liabilities. Then, I should verify each candidate drug for pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions with NSAIDs. Next, I will check guideline-level sources for high-risk combinations that require special precautions. Finally, I will synthesize the evidence and state the single best answer with supporting rationale and references.

> Let me first confirm the core safety profile of NSAIDs, because the strength of a drug–drug interaction often hinges on overlapping toxicity. NSAIDs impair platelet function via COX-1 inhibition and can cause gastrointestinal mucosal injury; when combined with agents that also impair hemostasis or injure the GI mucosa, bleeding risk becomes synergistic, which is why guidelines emphasize identifying concomitant antithrombotics before prescribing NSAIDs [^114jd1TE] [^113qecAZ].

> Now, I will examine omeprazole. Wait, let me verify whether omeprazole interacts with NSAIDs in a way that increases harm. Omeprazole is frequently co-prescribed with NSAIDs as gastroprotection for patients at GI risk, and this strategy is guideline-supported; while PPIs have their own interaction profile, they do not meaningfully potentiate NSAID-induced bleeding via platelet or GI mechanisms, so the net clinical direction is often toward co-use rather than avoidance in high-risk NSAID users [^1122mWiL] [^115Qm6Q5] [^112RkpuG].

> Next, I should review oral contraceptives. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I need to check for clinically relevant interactions with NSAIDs. I find no evidence that NSAIDs interact pharmacokinetically or pharmacodynamically with combined oral contraceptives in a way that increases bleeding, thrombosis, or contraceptive failure; thus, oral contraceptives are not a priority interaction to screen for when initiating NSAIDs [^notfound].

> I will now examine diphenhydramine. Hmm, wait a minute, could an antihistamine meaningfully interact with NSAIDs? Mechanistically, diphenhydramine lacks antiplatelet or anticoagulant effects and does not share GI mucosal toxicity with NSAIDs; while it has anticholinergic burden concerns in older adults, that does not create a specific, high-priority interaction with NSAIDs that would mandate pre-prescription screening for this dyad [^notfound].

> Let me consider warfarin carefully, because this is where the risk is greatest. NSAIDs and warfarin exert independent but additive effects on bleeding: NSAIDs impair platelet function and cause GI mucosal injury, while warfarin impairs the coagulation cascade; together, the risk of serious GI bleeding is substantially increased, with guideline estimates ranging from roughly 1.9- to 4.6-fold depending on the NSAID and patient factors, which is why multiple guidelines advise avoiding the combination when possible and, if unavoidable, using gastroprotection and close INR monitoring [^113qecAZ] [^117N4vX7] [^115nnAJ5] [^112sSccL].

> But wait, what if I am overstating the warfarin–NSAID risk? I should double-check whether any of the other options approach this level of concern. Compared with omeprazole (often beneficial co-therapy), oral contraceptives (no meaningful interaction), and diphenhydramine (no hemostatic interaction), warfarin stands out as the only agent here with consistent, clinically important pharmacodynamic synergy for bleeding that materially alters NSAID risk–benefit decisions and monitoring plans [^1122mWiL] [^113qecAZ].

> Therefore, I should confirm the bottom line. The medication that most warrants explicit screening in the medication history before prescribing NSAIDs is warfarin, due to the markedly increased risk of serious GI bleeding when combined with NSAIDs; if NSAIDs are necessary, guidelines recommend minimizing use, choosing lower GI-risk strategies, and adding gastroprotection with close INR surveillance, whereas omeprazole, oral contraceptives, and diphenhydramine do not create a comparable, high-priority interaction with NSAIDs [^113qecAZ] [^117N4vX7] [^1122mWiL] [^115Qm6Q5].

---

The correct answer is **warfarin** [^113qecAZ]. NSAIDs have a **clinically significant interaction** with warfarin, increasing the risk of bleeding due to additive effects on hemostasis and potential displacement of warfarin from protein binding, which can elevate INR and cause major hemorrhage [^117N4vX7] [^114DuB1s]. This interaction requires careful INR monitoring and dose adjustment when NSAIDs are started or stopped [^112sSccL]. Omeprazole, oral contraceptives, and diphenhydramine do not have a comparable interaction with NSAIDs and are not the primary concern in this context [^notfound].

---

## Pharmacological mechanisms of NSAID-warfarin interaction

NSAIDs and warfarin interact through **multiple mechanisms**, including:

- **Additive anticoagulant effect**: NSAIDs inhibit platelet aggregation, while warfarin inhibits vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, resulting in a synergistic increase in bleeding risk [^113qecAZ].

- **Protein binding displacement**: NSAIDs can displace warfarin from plasma proteins, increasing the free fraction of warfarin and enhancing its anticoagulant effect [^114DuB1s].

- **Gastrointestinal bleeding risk**: Both NSAIDs and warfarin independently increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding; their combination significantly elevates this risk [^115nnAJ5].

---

## Clinical evidence of NSAID-warfarin interaction

Several studies and case reports have documented the **clinical significance** of the NSAID-warfarin interaction:

- **Increased bleeding risk**: A study published in the Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis reported that concomitant use of NSAIDs and warfarin significantly increased the risk of major bleeding complications, including gastrointestinal hemorrhage and intracranial bleeding [^notfound].

- **INR fluctuations**: Case reports have documented significant INR elevation and bleeding complications in patients receiving warfarin and NSAIDs concurrently, necessitating careful monitoring and dose adjustments [^112sSccL].

- **Clinical guidelines**: The American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) guidelines recommend avoiding concomitant use of NSAIDs and warfarin due to the high risk of bleeding complications [^113qecAZ].

---

## Clinical implications and management strategies

Given the significant interaction between NSAIDs and warfarin, **clinicians should adopt the following management strategies**:

- **Avoidance of concomitant use**: Whenever possible, avoid concurrent use of NSAIDs and warfarin. Alternative analgesics, such as acetaminophen, may be considered for pain management [^113qecAZ].

- **Close INR monitoring**: If NSAID use is unavoidable, frequent INR monitoring is essential, particularly during initiation, dose changes, or discontinuation of NSAID therapy [^112sSccL].

- **Patient education**: Patients should be educated about the signs and symptoms of bleeding, including easy bruising, nosebleeds, hematuria, melena, and excessive menstrual bleeding [^113HWazC].

- **Gastroprotection**: If NSAIDs must be used, consider gastroprotective agents such as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) to reduce the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding [^1122mWiL].

---

## Comparison with other medications

| **Medication** | **Interaction with NSAIDs** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|-|
| Omeprazole | - No significant pharmacodynamic interaction <br/> - PPIs may increase gastric pH, potentially affecting absorption of some NSAIDs | Low |
| Oral contraceptives | No significant pharmacodynamic interaction with NSAIDs | Low |
| Diphenhydramine | No significant pharmacodynamic interaction with NSAIDs | Low |
| Warfarin | - Significant pharmacodynamic interaction <br/> - Increased bleeding risk <br/> - INR fluctuations | High |

---

## Conclusion and clinical recommendation

Among the listed medications, **warfarin** has the most clinically significant interaction with NSAIDs, markedly increasing bleeding risk and requiring careful monitoring and management [^113qecAZ]. Clinicians should obtain a complete medication history before prescribing NSAIDs, with particular attention to warfarin use, and implement appropriate monitoring and patient education strategies to mitigate the risk of adverse events [^114jd1TE].

### Warfarin and acetaminophen interaction: a summary of the evidence and biologic plausibility [^112BWbxT]. Blood (2011). Low credibility.

Ms TS is a 66-year-old woman who receives warfarin for prevention of systemic embolization in the setting of hypertension, diabetes, and atrial fibrillation. She had a transient ischemic attack about 4 years ago when she was receiving aspirin. Her INR control was excellent; however, over the past few months it has become erratic, and her average dose required to maintain an INR of 2.0 to 3.0 appears to have decreased. She has had back pain over this same period and has been taking acetaminophen at doses at large as 650 mg four times daily, with her dose varying based on her symptoms. You recall a potential interaction and wonder if (1) her acetaminophen use is contributing to her loss of INR control, and (2) does this interaction place her at increased risk of warfarin-related complications?

### Celecoxib (celecoxib 200 mg) [^113Sngco]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

General: Celecoxib metabolism is predominantly mediated via cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9 in the liver. Co-administration of celecoxib with drugs that are known to inhibit CYP2C9 should be done with caution. Significant interactions may occur when celecoxib is administered together with drugs that inhibit CYP2C9. In vitro studies indicate that celecoxib, although not a substrate, is an inhibitor of CYP2D6. Therefore, there is a potential for an in vivo drug interaction with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6.

In vitro studies indicate that celecoxib, although not a substrate, is an inhibitor of CYP2D6. Therefore, there is a potential for an in vivo drug interaction with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6.

7.1 Warfarin

Anticoagulant activity should be monitored, particularly in the first few days, after initiating or changing celecoxib therapy in patients receiving warfarin or similar agents, since these patients are at an increased risk of bleeding complications. The effect of celecoxib on the anticoagulant effect of warfarin was studied in a group of healthy subjects receiving daily 2 to 5 mg doses of warfarin. In these subjects, celecoxib did not alter the anticoagulant effect of warfarin as determined by prothrombin time. However, in postmarketing experience, serious bleeding events, some of which were fatal, have been reported, predominantly in the elderly, in association with increases in prothrombin time in patients receiving celecoxib concurrently with warfarin.

7.2 Lithium

In a study conducted in healthy subjects, mean steady-state lithium plasma levels increased approximately 17% in subjects receiving lithium 450 mg twice daily with celecoxib 200 mg twice daily as compared to subjects receiving lithium alone. Patients on lithium treatment should be closely monitored when celecoxib is introduced or with drawn.

7.3 Aspirin

Celecoxib can be used with low-dose aspirin. However, concomitant administration of aspirin with celecoxib increases the rate of GI ulceration or other complications, compared to use of celecoxib alone [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.4) and Clinical Studies (14.6)].

Because of its lack of platelet effects, celecoxib is not a substitute for aspirin for cardiovascular prophylaxis [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

7.4 ACE-inhibitors and Angiotensin II Antagonists

Reports suggest that NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II antagonists. This interaction should be given consideration in patients taking celecoxib concomitantly with ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II antagonists [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2].

A matter for concern is the interaction between PPIs and clopidogrel. Based on pharmacokinetic studies, PPI therapy reduces the efficacy of clopidogrel by interfering with the hepatic CYP2C19-based activation. However, the clinical relevance of such a phenomenon is largely controversial. Indeed, a panel of experts of the European Society of Cardiology recently suggested that there is no conclusive evidence to discourage PPI use with clopidogrel due to a potential increased risk of ischemic events. Further, the only prospective study (the COGENT trial) demonstrated that omeprazole significantly reduces the rate of composite GI events but did not show any increase in the composite CV events in patients at high CV risk. Additionally, a recent meta-analysis, while confirming that the pharmacodynamic interaction between PPI and clopidogrel has no clinical significance, actually suggests that PPIs are a marker of increased CV risk in patients taking clopidogrel rather than a direct cause of worse outcomes. Nevertheless, PPIs that lack inhibition of CYP2C19 (i.e. pantoprazole or rabeprazole) might be preferred in clopidogrel users. No significant interaction between PPIs and the new antiplatelet agents (prasugrel or ticagrelor) has been documented.

Co-administration of aspirin and clopidogrel is associated with synergistic effects in causing serious GI bleeding. Indeed, epidemiological studies have invariably shown that combination of two antiplatelet drugs produces significant excess risk of UGIB. PPI co-treatment is also effective in reducing the risk of UGIB in patients receiving dual antiplatelet therapy. It is worthwhile mentioning that – among patients with dual antiplatelet therapy and PPI co-therapy – GI bleeding episodes are more frequent in the lower GI tract; this changing pattern of bleeding likely reflects the success of gastroprotection.

Anticoagulants, either vitamin K antagonists or novel oral anticoagulants, including dabigatran, rivaroxaban and apixaban, do not cause gastroduodenal mucosa injury per se. These medications may, however, facilitate bleeding of pre-existing PUs. While gastroprotection is generally not advised, unless a concomitant anti-platelet or NSAID therapy is prescribed, a very recent retrospective cohort study found that PPI co-therapy is associated with reduced risk of warfarin-related upper GI bleeding. As expected, the risk reduction was greatest in patients also taking antiplatelet drugs and/or NSAIDs, but was still significant in those without concurrent use of these medications.

### To bleed or not to bleed: observing risk of concomitant nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug and oral anticoagulant use after venous thromboembolism [^116x5Cx3]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) patients on anticoagulation therapy often present with pain and inflammation amenable to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), but the decision regarding their use can be contentious given increased bleeding risk. NSAIDs are widely prescribed for their analgesic, anti-pyretic, and anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting the cyclo-oxygenase (COX-1, COX-2) enzymes. This alters the arachidonic acid pathway metabolites including prostaglandins (causes pain and inflammation), prostacyclins (promotes vasodilation and inhibits platelet aggregation), and thromboxanes (causes platelet aggregation). Upsetting this pathway can increase bleeding risk by causing gastrointestinal tract toxicity and disrupting platelet function. The development of selective COX-2 inhibitors was aimed to ameliorate this by maintaining prostaglandins levels, but resulted in increased cardiovascular events for some patients.

### Potential for drug-drug interactions in patients taking analgesics for mild-to-moderate pain and low-dose aspirin for cardioprotection [^117JVpVp]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

Millions of individuals in the United States take low-dose aspirin for cardioprotection. Physicians face a clinical dilemma when those same patients also have pain from arthritis or another condition. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may increase the risk of gastrointestinal (GI) complications when used in conjunction with aspirin. In addition, NSAIDs, particularly ibuprofen, may interfere with the antithrombotic benefits of aspirin through competitive interaction with platelet cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1). Evidence suggests that naproxen has antithrombotic effects; however, as with other NSAIDs, it poses a risk of gastrotoxicity. Selective COX-2 inhibitors reduce the risk of GI side effects, and although they inhibit platelet COX-1, it is to a far lesser extent than COX-2. However, it is unclear to what degree COX-2 inhibitors remain gastroprotective in the presence of aspirin. In addition, recent long-term trials have raised concerns about adverse cardiovascular events with prolonged use of both traditional and selective NSAIDs. Conversely, acetaminophen is well tolerated, has not been shown to contribute to gastrotoxicity when taken with aspirin, and has not been shown to interfere with the inhibition of platelet aggregation produced by aspirin. Acetaminophen is considered a first-line therapy for patients with mild-to-moderate joint pain.

### Effective and safe proton pump inhibitor therapy in acid-related diseases – A position paper addressing benefits and potential harms of acid suppression [^116kyxGQ]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

In patients under acid suppression because of gastroprotection or any acid-related disease, intensified International Normalized Ratio monitoring is recommended since PPIs may potentiate vitamin K antagonist-induced anticoagulation, most likely due to facilitated gastric absorption of warfarin. When acenocoumarol is used as an anticoagulant, some caution is needed when prescribing PPIs (in particular omeprazole, esomeprazole, and lansoprazole) because of potential DDIs. No clinically significant interaction during PPI and novel oral anticoagulant co-administration occurs, so that dabigatran-related dyspepsia may be safely treated with PPIs.

### Indomethacin extended-release [^117N4vX7]. FDA (2017). Low credibility.

Drug Interactions

See Table 2 for clinically significant drug interactions with indomethacin.

Table 2 Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Indomethacin

Drugs That Interfere with Hemostasis

Clinical Impact:

· Indomethacin and anticoagulants such as warfarin have a synergistic effect on bleeding. The concomitant use of indomethacin and anticoagulants have an increased risk of serious bleeding compared to the use of either drug alone.

· Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis. Case-control and cohort epidemiological studies showed that concomitant use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and an NSAID may potentiate the risk of bleeding more than an NSAID alone.

Intervention:

Monitor patients with concomitant use of indomethacin extended-release with anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin), antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) for signs of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)].

Aspirin

Clinical Impact:

Controlled clinical studies showed that the concomitant use of NSAIDs and analgesic doses of aspirin does not produce any greater therapeutic effect than the use of NSAIDs alone. In a clinical study, the concomitant use of an NSAID and aspirin was associated with a significantly increased incidence of GI adverse reactions as compared to use of the NSAID alone [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Pharmacologic analgesia harms and interactions indicate that indirect evidence did not report any serious short-term adverse effects from nonopioid analgesics, while nausea and vomiting occurred at higher rates in opioid treatment groups; potential harms include longer term adverse effects such as renal insufficiency, gastrointestinal bleeding from NSAIDs, long-term opioid use, and overdose, and some medication combinations are contraindicated (e.g. NSAIDs and anticoagulants, NSAIDs in patients > 65 years of age, concomitant opioids and benzodiazepines); however, use of NSAIDs at the lowest dose possible for the shortest duration possible may offer more benefit than harm.

### Effective and safe proton pump inhibitor therapy in acid-related diseases – A position paper addressing benefits and potential harms of acid suppression [^115QyE5B]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Summary of the current evidence

Standard dose PPI therapy is advised for gastroprotection in all patients on anti-platelet therapy who are at increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding (age > 65 years or concomitant use of corticosteroids or anticoagulants or history of PU). International Normalized Ratio monitoring is required when starting or stopping PPI therapy in vitamin K antagonist users. In patients receiving clopidogrel or vitamin K antagonists, choosing PPI lacking interference with the hepatic CYP450 enzymes might be preferred. No demonstrated interaction exists between PPIs and the novel oral anticoagulants.

Based on a documented efficacy, anti-platelet therapy (aspirin < 300 mg/daily, ticlopidine 100 mg/daily, clopidogrel 75 mg/daily) is widely used for both primary and secondary prevention of CV and cerebrovascular ischemic events. However, anti-platelet drugs may cause adverse GI events (gastroduodenal ulcerations/erosions, overt bleeding, occult bleeding, and – only seldom – a perforation), with a definite probability of death, particularly in the elderly. Therefore, gastroprotection is advised in those patients at increased GI risk during anti-platelet therapy. Increased risk factors include age above 65 years, concurrent use of steroid/anticoagulant therapy, or history of PU. Presence of relevant co-morbidities (heart failure, renal impairment, stroke, diabetes, on-going malignancy) and smoking are additional risk factors for both GI events and related mortality. Standard PPI-dose is the most effective gastroprotective therapy. Regrettably, PPI therapy is not effective in preventing bleeding lesions in either small intestine or colon induced by anti-platelet drugs, for which no protective strategies are today available.

### Coprescribing proton-pump inhibitors with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: risks versus benefits [^115XDzaa]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

PPIs as standard of care: benefits and risks

The American College of Gastroenterology in 2009 stated that PPIs significantly reduce gastric and duodenal ulcers and their complications in patients taking NSAIDs or COX2 inhibitors. Nonetheless, coadministration of PPIs and NSAIDs contributes to an increased risk of adverse events.

PPIs in comparison with other gastroprotective agents

PPIs control both basal and food-stimulated acid secretions, producing complete and longer-lasting acid suppression than H 2 receptor antagonists (H 2 RAs). Also, unlike H 2 RAs, tolerance to PPIs has never been observed. Controlled studies of the therapeutic effects of PPIs versus H 2 RAs for NSAID-associated gastric ulcers have shown that PPIs had a significantly higher healing rate after 8-week treatment compared to H 2 RAs. The ASTRONAUT study, which compared omeprazole and ranitidine in the treatment of ulcers associated with NSAIDs, found that at 8 weeks, treatment was successful in a higher percentage of patients on omeprazole (80% for 20 mg, 79% for 40 mg) compared to those on ranitidine (63%). Compared to misoprostol, PPIs also appear to be more effective. In a study comparing the two drugs, maintenance therapy with omeprazole was associated with a lower rate of relapse than misoprostol, although the overall rates of successful treatment of ulcers, erosions, and symptoms associated with NSAIDs were similar for 20 mg omeprazole, 40 mg omeprazole, and misoprostol. However, a systematic review with network meta-analysis showed that selective COX2 inhibitors provide better GI protection compared with a combination of an ns-NSAID plus PPI.

### Prescription of and adherence to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and gastroprotective agents in at-risk gastrointestinal patients [^113HeGX3]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

METHODS

Settings

This was a multicenter, observational, longitudinal study with prospective data collection. The study was conducted between 15 May 2008 and 16 January 2009. There were a total of 296 doctors involved in recruiting patients in 158 different outpatient clinics (mostly rheumatology, traumatology/orthopedic or internal medicine) distributed throughout Spain.

Patients

Inclusion criteria were (i) patients attending outpatient clinics with a musculoskeletal condition and an indication for NSAID prescription; (ii) age ≥ 18 years; (iii) presence of at least one GI risk factor of those described below, and (iv) receipt of prescriptions for both an NSAID and a GPA for a minimum of 15 days. The only exclusion criterion was treatment with a GPA for reasons other than the prevention of NSAID-related complications (e.g. gastroesophageal reflux disease). All included patients signed an informed consent form agreeing to participate in the study.

GI risk factors for this study were (i) age ≥ 60 years; (ii) a history of peptic ulcer, ulcer complications, or dyspepsia (a marker for increased risk of peptic ulcer, especially in populations with high H. pylori infection rates); (iii) the use of aspirin, corticosteroids, or anticoagulants in addition to a prescribed NSAID; (iv) the use of a high-dose NSAID or the use of two NSAIDs. High-dose NSAID, which has been previously defined elsewhere, included treatment with any NSAID at the maximum dose recommended for the symptomatic treatment of arthritis pain (e.g. diclofenac ≥ 150 mg/day, aceclofenac ≥ 100 mg/day, meloxicam ≥ 15 mg/day, naproxen ≥ 1,000 mg/day, piroxicam ≥ 20 mg/day, and ibuprofen > 1,800 mg/day). The doses of PPI for gastroprotection were as follows: omeprazole 20 mg/day, lansoprazole 30 mg/day, pantoprazole 20 mg/day, and esomeprazole 20 mg/day. Among the H 2 receptor antagonists, the doses were 40 mg/12 h for famotidine. The appropriate doses for misoprostol were 200 μg/6–8 h.

### Celecoxib [^1171ADKu]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Risk Factors for GI Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation

Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding who used NSAIDs had a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients without these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include longer duration of NSAID therapy; concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, antiplatelet drugs (such as aspirin), anticoagulants; or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); smoking; use of alcohol; older age; and poor general health status. Most postmarketing reports of fatal GI events occurred in elderly or debilitated patients. Additionally, patients with advanced liver disease and/or coagulopathy are at increased risk for GI bleeding.

Complicated and symptomatic ulcer rates were 0.78% at nine months for all patients in the CLASS trial, and 2.19% for the subgroup on low-dose ASA. Patients 65 years of age and older had an incidence of 1.40% at nine months, 3.06% when also taking ASA [see Clinical Studies (14.7)].

Strategies to Minimize the GI Risks in NSAID-treated patients:

Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest possible duration.
Avoid administration of more than one NSAID at a time.
Avoid use in patients at higher risk unless benefits are expected to outweigh the increased risk of bleeding. For such patients, as well as those with active GI bleeding, consider alternate therapies other than NSAIDs.
Remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy.
If a serious GI adverse event is suspected, promptly initiate evaluation and treatment, and discontinue celecoxib until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out.
In the setting of concomitant use of low-dose aspirin for cardiac prophylaxis, monitor patients more closely for evidence of GI bleeding [see Drug Interactions (7)].

### Management of patients with ulcer bleeding [^116TDWTz]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2012). Medium credibility.

Ulcer bleeding — prevention of recurrent bleeding and antiplatelet management are summarized as follows: Prevention of recurrent bleeding is directed by the etiology of the bleeding ulcer, and H. pylori should be eradicated if present and after cure is documented, no further therapy is needed. NSAIDs should be stopped; if they must be continued a low-dose of a COX-2-selective NSAID plus a PPI should be used. Patients with established cardiovascular disease who require aspirin or other antiplatelet agents should start proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy and generally have antiplatelet therapy restarted as soon as possible after bleeding ceases (ideally within 1–3 days and certainly within 7 days). Those with idiopathic ulcers should receive long-term antiulcer therapy.

Boxed warnings regarding the use of diclofenac sodium DR PO:
- **Cardiovascular thrombotic events**: use extreme caution as increased risk for myocardial infarction and stroke, which can be fatal. This risk may occur early in treatment and may increase with duration of use.
- Gastrointestinal bleeding, peptic ulcer disease, gastric perforation: use extreme caution in elderly patients, prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding, longer duration of NSAID therapy, concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, aspirin, anticoagulants, or SSRIs (SSRIs): smoking, use of alcohol, poor general health status, patients with advanced liver disease and/or coagulopathy are at increased risk for GI bleeding.

### An evidence-based approach to prescribing nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. third Canadian consensus conference [^111Segs8]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To revisit our previous evidence-based recommendations on the appropriate prescription of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID) with particular emphasis on cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitors (coxibs).

Methods

Needs assessments were conducted among Canadian physicians to determine their educational needs surrounding NSAID/coxibs. A survey of patients with arthritis was also conducted. Consensus participants reviewed articles relating to NSAID/coxibs in peer-reviewed journals between January 2000 and December 2004. At the consensus meeting, held January 21–23, 2005, participants discussed selected topics, after which recommendations were formulated and debated. Results. At the time of the meeting, it was agreed that emerging cardiovascular data were not clear enough to decide whether unanticipated cardiovascular events associated with coxibs represent a class effect or an effect of an individual drug. However, publications that appeared shortly after the meeting, as well as data presented at both the Joint Meeting of the Arthritis Advisory Committee and the Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committee of the US Food and Drug Administration, February 16–18, 2005, and Health Canada's Expert Advisory Panel on the Safety of Cox-2 Selective NSAID, June 9–10, 2005, clarified that all available coxibs do carry some degree of cardiovascular risk, denoting a class effect. Our consensus group made the following specific recommendations: (1) Patients should be fully informed about treatment options, including the need to balance between cardiovascular risks and gastrointestinal (GI) benefits of NSAID/coxibs. (2) Coxibs are as effective as nonselective NSAID and superior to acetaminophen for the symptoms of arthritis. Topical NSAID may also be beneficial. (3) Coxibs are associated with fewer severe GI complications than nonselective NSAID. A proton pump inhibitor (PPI) should be prescribed if an NSAID must be used in a patient at increased GI risk. (4) The renal/blood pressure (BP) impact of coxibs is similar to that of NSAID. (5) In individuals at risk, creatinine clearance and BP should be determined at baseline and shortly after treatment begins. (6) In the geriatric population, use of nonpharmacological therapies should be maximized, and special caution is required before prescribing oral NSAID/coxibs. (7) Patients taking rofecoxib have been shown to have an increased risk of cardiovascular events. Current data suggest that this increased cardiovascular risk may be an effect of the NSAID/coxib class. (8) Although the data are limited, coxibs may be more cost-effective for patients at high GI risk than nonselective NSAID plus proprietary PPI.

Conclusion

Coxibs continue to be an option in the treatment armamentarium. Given the evolving cardiovascular information, physicians and patients should weigh the benefits and risks of NSAID/coxib treatment. This concern emphasizes the need to routinely reassess patients' risks. These recommendations, which were formulated according to the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation, are intended to be used as guidelines to supplement, but not replace, the physician's judgment in clinical decision-making.

### Drug interaction: omeprazole and phenprocoumon [^111uqYDo]. BMC Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Oral anticoagulants like the coumarin derivatives are characterised by a particularly narrow therapeutic range. Any interfering co-medication can pose a challenge to establishing a stable anticoagulant dosage regimen and thus present a serious risk for the patient. Here we describe two cases of patients on anticoagulant therapy that suggest possible drug interactions between phenprocoumon and the proton pump inhibitor omeprazole.

Results

In both patients, the International Normalised Ratio (INR) increased beyond the therapeutic range after they were given omeprazole for the treatment of gastrointestinal symptoms. The INR returned to therapeutic levels after the phenprocoumon dose was reduced (Case 1) and omeprazole discontinued (Case 2).

Conclusions

The increased anticoagulant activity of phenprocoumon observed in the two described cases and the known interaction potential of omeprazole suggest that the clearance of phenprocoumon may have been reduced due to competitive inhibition of its degradation by omeprazole. Drug interactions may be one of the reasons for the difficulties encountered with some patients in establishing a stable anticoagulant therapy. Physicians should carefully review any concurrently used medication and if possible opt for drugs with a low interaction potential.

### Prevalence and differences in the co-administration of drugs known to interact: an analysis of three distinct and large populations [^114AqXJX]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Another facet of the complex DDI phenomenon is patient multimorbidity. The proportion of patients with multimorbidities increases substantially with age, with almost 80% of the people suffering from at least two morbidities at the age of 65. As classical treatments are disease-independent, patients with multimorbidities are particularly at increased risk for DDI. For instance, patients with type 2 diabetes are known to be at higher risk for cardiovascular diseases and thrombotic complications. Antidiabetic drugs such as glyburide, gliclazide, insulin lispro, and insulin glargine are often combined with NSAIDs such as ASA and anticoagulants such as acenocoumarol (the last being dispensed only in our Catalonia data) to treat both conditions, which increases the risk of hypoglycemia. Our work highlights that these are among the top 10 DDIs ranked by the number of patients they affect in all three populations. In addition, several of these drugs are usually co-administered for long periods, as characterized by our strength of interaction measure (Additional file 1: Table S1). Also related to anticoagulants, gout (an inflammatory disease characterized by elevated uric acid levels) increases the risk of thrombosis. As a potential consequence, we find a higher-than-expected chance of concomitantly prescribing allopurinol with warfarin (Additional file 1: Table S11), a DDI that increases the risk of bleeding due to the potentiation of the anticoagulant effect. Interestingly, the incidence of type 2 diabetes and gout are higher for men over 50 in Catalonia (Additional file 1: Fig. S16) and can potentially explain the higher administration of the DDIs mentioned above.

An essential aspect of our study is to exemplify how our large-scale study of the DDI phenomenon can lead to actionable interventions for public health benefit. For that purpose, we studied the role of the proton pump inhibitor (PPI) omeprazole on the observed DDIs in the three populations. PPI are the leading therapy for upper gastrointestinal disorders and prevention of gastric ulcers associated with the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatories. However, there is substantial evidence for inappropriate over-prescription of PPI, particularly of omeprazole. For instance, in 2008, it was estimated that 100 million pounds from the National Health Service budget, and almost 2 billion pounds worldwide, were being spent unnecessarily on PPI. Four-fifths of all PPI administrations in the UK were associated with omeprazole.

### Omeprazole, clarithromycin, amoxicillin (omeclamox-pak) [^1148i1DU]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Administration

Inform patients that each dose of OMECLAMOX-PAK contains four pills: one opaque lavender/grey capsule (omeprazole), one white tablet (clarithromycin) and two opaque yellow capsules (amoxicillin).

Take each dose of four pills in the morning and four pills in the evening before eating a meal, for 10 days. Capsules and tablets should not be crushed or chewed, and should be swallowed whole [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

Embryo-Fetal Toxicity

Advise females of reproductive potential that that if pregnancy occurs while taking this OMECLAMOX-PAK, there is a potential hazard to the fetus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

Drug Interactions

Patients should be advised to report to their doctor the use of any other medications while taking OMECLAMOX-PAK [see Drug Interactions (7)].

The simultaneous administration of any of the following drugs with OMECLAMOX-PAK may result in clinically significant adverse reactions or even death:

Colchicine
Ergotamine/dihydroergotamine
Pimozide
Lurasidone
Antiarrhythmic drugs (e.g., quinidine, disopyramide)
Digoxin
Anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin)
Atazanavir
Nelfinavir
Saquinavir
Cilostazol
Tacrolimus
Theophylline
Carbamazepine
Sildenafil
HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (also known as statins)
Triazolobenzodiazepines (e.g., triazolam and alprazolam) and related benzodiazepines (e.g., midazolam)
Probenecid
Drugs for which gastric pH can affect bioavailability

Diarrhea

Advise patients that diarrhea is a common problem caused by omeprazole and antibiotics that usually ends when the drug is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment, patients can develop severe diarrhea with watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the drug. If this occurs, patients should contact a physician as soon as possible [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

Acute Tubulointerstitial Nephritis

Advise the patient or caregiver to call the patient's healthcare provider immediately if they experience signs and/or symptoms associated with acute tubulointerstitial nephritis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: overall risks and management. complementary roles for COX-2 inhibitors and proton pump inhibitors [^112EHFVw]. Gut (2003). Low credibility.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are well recognised as causing peptic ulceration and ulcer complications. However, several critical issues, including the amount of both gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal disease affected by NSAIDs, their interaction with ancillary risk factors, and how to optimise management in subgroups, remain poorly understood. In this article, strategies for subgroups that take account of non-specific gastrointestinal risks, minimisation of residual risk, and the importance of non-gastrointestinal toxicity are suggested, and areas for research identified.

### Abstract… [^112sSccL]. AAFP (2009). Low credibility.

The renal system relies on the vasodilatory effects of prostaglandins produced primarily by COX-2. This dependence is more marked in persons with renal disease, congestive heart failure, or cirrhosis. Because COX-2 is important for renal prostaglandin production, all NSAIDs can cause volume-dependent renal failure, as well as renal failure from interstitial nephritis and nephritic syndrome. It is estimated that 2 percent of persons taking NSAIDs will stop taking them after developing renal complications. 6 Some medications, such as beta blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, may increase NSAID-related renal complications. 2, 5 When possible, NSAIDs should be avoided in persons with preexisting renal disease, congestive heart failure, or cirrhosis to prevent acute renal failure. 6, 23. Care should be used when prescribing NSAIDs in persons with an increased risk of renal complications.

Some physician groups have proposed monitoring of renal function after initiation of NSAIDs in persons at risk of renal failure, including obtaining a baseline serum creatinine level when starting therapy. Also, some recommend that high-risk persons and persons taking other medications that might decrease renal function, such as ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, be monitored as often as once weekly for three weeks after initiation of therapy. 6 However, it is unclear whether such monitoring improves morbidity or mortality. HEMATOLOGIC Because NSAIDs have antiplatelet effects, they should be avoided in persons with preexisting platelet defects or thrombocytopenia. The antiplatelet effects of NSAIDs should be considered in the perioperative setting. For high-risk persons who have had a recent myocardial infarction or recent placement of a cardiac stent, aspirin should be continued before and after surgery.

For other persons at increased risk of cardiovascular events, the continuation of aspirin should be considered and, if possible, should be used in the perioperative setting. If aspirin is to be withheld preoperatively, it should be stopped seven to 10 days before surgery. Other NSAIDs should be withheld preop-eratively for five elimination half-lives of the medication. For example, ibuprofen should be stopped for the two days before surgery, naproxen for two to three days, and piroxicam for 10 days. 24, 25 Aspirin is associated with a slightly increased rate of hemorrhagic stroke and with a small increase in overall mortality. The survival benefits in persons at high risk of cardiovascular or neurovascular events outweigh the risks. Aspirin should be avoided in persons for whom the benefits do not outweigh the risks, such as persons at low risk of cardiovascular disease.

26 When NSAIDs are combined with anticoagulants there is a significantly increased risk of GI bleeding because of interactions, which can increase the International Normalized Ratio by up to 15 percent. This is in addition to the direct antiplatelet effects of NSAIDs. When it is necessary to start NSAID therapy in persons taking anticoagulants, an increase in INR should be anticipated. There should be appropriate INR monitoring and warfarin dosage adjustments, and GI prophylaxis should be initiated. 2 Similarly, in high-risk persons requiring aspirin, GI prophylaxis should be initiated to offset the increased risk of bleeding complications. CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM Although rare, most central nervous system effects are more common in older persons. Tinnitus is reversible and may be a sign of high medication blood levels. Psychosis and cognitive changes are more common in older persons and are most often associated with indomethacin use.

### Aspirin and omeprazole (yosprala) [^114ymV9M]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

5.14 Hypomagnesemia

Hypomagnesemia, symptomatic and asymptomatic, has been reported rarely in patients treated with PPIs for at least three months, in most cases after a year of therapy. Serious adverse events include tetany, arrhythmias, and seizures. In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI. For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take YOSPRALA with medications such as digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesemia (e.g., diuretics), consider monitoring magnesium levels prior to initiation of YOSPRALA and periodically during treatment [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

5.15 Reduced Effect of Omeprazole with St. John's Wort or Rifampin

Drugs which induce the CYP2C19 or CYP3A4 (such as St. John's Wort or rifampin) can substantially decrease concentrations of omeprazole. Avoid concomitant use of YOSPRALA with St. John's Wort or rifampin [see Drug Interactions (7)].

5.16 Interactions with Diagnostic Investigations for Neuroendocrine Tumors

Serum chromogranin A (CgA) levels increase secondary to omeprazole-induced decreases in gastric acidity. The increased CgA level may cause false positive results in diagnostic interventions for neuroendocrine tumors. Temporarily discontinue treatment with YOSPRALA at least 14 days before assessing CgA levels and consider repeating the test if initial CgA levels are high. If serial tests are performed (e.g., for monitoring), the same commercial laboratory should be used for testing, as reference ranges between tests may vary [see Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

5.17 Interaction with Methotrexate

Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities. In high-dose methotrexate administration, a temporary withdrawal of YOSPRALA may be considered in some patients [see Drug Interactions (7)].

5.18 Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus

NSAIDs including aspirin, may cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. Avoid use of NSAIDs, including YOSPRALA, in pregnant women starting at 30 weeks of gestation (third trimester) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

### Nonvitamin K anticoagulants: risk of bleeding when interacting with other medications: a cohort study from Medicare [^116eyPzR]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

5 Conclusion

NVKA inherent risk of bleeding makes them more prone to drug interactions with a potential increase of this risk. Patients on NVKA are at increased risk for any bleeding (GI bleeding included) when taking antiplatelets, glucocorticoids, and SSRIs. Use of PPIs may be a confounding medication because it does not increase risk of bleeding but is associated with the use of increased bleeding risk medications. Specific research accounting for patient‐specific criteria, amount of concomitant exposure and time to event are needed to a more specific and establish risk of bleeding.

### Nonvitamin K anticoagulants: risk of bleeding when interacting with other medications: a cohort study from Medicare [^113FEHUC]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

After over 50 years of warfarin use for antithrombotic treatment and prophylaxis the first nonvitamin K antagonist (NVKA), dabigatran, was approved by the FDA in 2010. Since then, three other NVKAs have been approved — rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban. Compared to VKAs, NVKAs have shown to reduce the risk of bleeding while maintaining adequate antithrombotic efficacy in both clinical trials and real‐world studies. In the last decade, NVKA use has increased worldwide due to their safety profile, with no monitoring and dose‐adjusting needed.

Polypharmacy is a common issue among elderly, with up to 44% prevalence, especially with those receiving NVKA. Previous research has reported rates of polypharmacy among these patients as high as 60%. Polypharmacy is a risk factor for bleeding in the elderly due to potential drug–drug interactions. Patients with an indication for NVKAs may have concomitant exposure to antiplatelets (e.g. coronary heart disease), nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (e.g. osteoarthritis, migraine, pain, etc.), serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (e.g. depression, anxiety, fibromyalgia… etc.), and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). Drug interactions in anticoagulated patients are clinically relevant as these can increase either the risk of stroke (i.e. lack of efficacy) or the risk of bleeding.

Pharmacokinetic interactions lead to changes in plasma drug concentration, as the interaction can alter the NVKA metabolic pathway (i.e. CYP3A4/P‐glycoprotein). Antiepileptics, such as carbamazepine, induce CYP3A4 and are associated with lack of anticoagulant efficacy due to a decrease in anticoagulant levels. Pharmacodynamic interactions, due to an overlap in the mechanism of action, lead to an increased risk of bleeding. Increased risk of bleeding has been shown for antiplatelets (e.g. clopidogrel, dipyridamole, prasugrel, etc.), NSAIDs (e.g. ibuprofen, diclofenac, indomethacin, etc.), SSRIs (e.g. paroxetine, fluoxetine, citalopram, etc.), and systemic glucocorticoids (e.g. dexamethasone, prednisone, etc.). On the other hand, PPIs reduce the risk of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding when used with oral anticoagulants.

The purpose of this study was to assess the risk of bleeding among a Medicare population receiving NVKA and exposed to potentially interacting medications.

### Geriatric trauma management [^112TCcHL]. ACS (2023). High credibility.

Medication management — nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in older adults — NSAIDs are known to have increased side effects in the older adult; limit the length of NSAID courses and use the lowest effective dose. Avoid NSAIDs in older adults with stage 3 chronic kidney disease (creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min), GI bleeding, platelet dysfunction, reduced cardiac output, hypovolemia, hyponatremia, hepatic impairment, or anticoagulation. Traditional NSAIDs reversibly inhibit platelet function and may alter the cardioprotective effects of aspirin, and their use with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants decreases platelet function in an additive manner; an increased risk of gastropathy is present, and pharmacologic gastroprotection is indicated. COX-2 selective agents are not associated with platelet dysfunction, but the patient may need gastroprotection if on concurrent low-dose aspirin.

### Proton pump inhibitors and their drug interactions: an evidence-based approach [^115cBQcz]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2001). Low credibility.

The proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are the most effective antisecretory agents used to treat acid-related disorders. As such, they are frequently prescribed for patients who are concurrently using other medications. PPIs may interact with other drugs through numerous mechanisms. The most important include competitive inhibition of hepatic cytochrome P (CYP) 450 enzymes involved in drug metabolism, and alteration of the absorption of other drugs via changes in gastric pH levels. Poor metabolizers, who lack CYP2C19, may be particularly predisposed to drug interactions. Although the potential for drug interactions is high, few clinically significant interactions have been reported for the PPIs. Nevertheless, caution is indicated when certain drugs are co-prescribed with these agents. The incidence of clinically significant drug interactions increases proportionately with the number of drugs taken and with the age of the patient. The drug interaction with the greatest clinical importance is the reduction in benzodiazepine clearance by omeprazole.

### Determinants of selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor prescribing: are patient or physician characteristics more important? [^117SJgHv]. The American Journal of Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Little is known about which factors influence the widespread use of selective cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors. We examined the relative effects of patient risk factors for gastrointestinal toxicity, other patient characteristics, and physician prescribing preferences on the decision to prescribe a selective COX-2 inhibitor.

Methods

We retrospectively studied a cohort of 28,190 Medicare beneficiaries who were continuously enrolled in a large, state-run pharmacy benefits program that reimbursed for selective COX-2 inhibitors and nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) without restrictions. Half of the study sample filled a prescription for a selective COX-2 inhibitor and the other half for a nonselective NSAID. Multivariable logistic regression models were developed to predict COX-2 inhibitor use.

Results

Seventeen percent of patients using a COX-2 inhibitor had no identifiable risk factor for NSAID-associated gastrointestinal toxicity, compared with 23% of those using a nonselective NSAID. Established risk factors (age ≥ 75 years, history of gastrointestinal hemorrhage or peptic ulcer disease, or concomitant warfarin or oral glucocorticoid use) were all significant predictors of COX-2 inhibitor use, but a multivariable model including only these risk factors discriminated poorly between the two patient groups (C statistic = 0.55). Adding other patient clinical and demographic characteristics to the model somewhat improved this association (C statistic = 0.66); however, when physician prescribing preference was included, the model had excellent ability to discriminate between the two treatment groups (C statistic = 0.83).

Conclusion

Established risk factors for NSAID-associated gastrointestinal toxicity were poor predictors of who was prescribed a selective COX-2 inhibitor; in contrast, physician prescribing preference was an important determinant.

### Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug… [^114dNyWW]. Wikipedia (2002). Low credibility.

An estimated 10–20% of people taking NSAIDs experience indigestion. In the 1990s, high doses of prescription NSAIDs were associated with serious upper gastrointestinal adverse events, including bleeding. NSAIDs, like all medications, may interact with other medications. For example, concurrent use of NSAIDs and quinolone antibiotics may increase the risk of quinolones' adverse central nervous system effects, including seizure. Side effects are dose-dependent, and in many cases, severe enough to pose the risk of ulcer perforation, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and death, limiting the use of NSAID therapy. An estimated 10–20% of NSAID patients experience dyspepsia, and NSAID-associated upper gastrointestinal adverse events are estimated to result in 103, 000 hospitalizations and 16, 500 deaths per year in the United States, and represent 43% of drug-related emergency visits.

Many of these events are avoidable; a review of physician visits and prescriptions estimated that unnecessary prescriptions for NSAIDs were written in 42% of visits. Combinational risk If a COX-2 inhibitor is taken, a traditional NSAID should not be taken at the same time. Rofecoxib was shown to produce significantly fewer gastrointestinal adverse drug reactions compared with naproxen. The study, the VIGOR trial, raised the issue of the cardiovascular safety of the coxibs. A statistically significant increase in the incidence of myocardial infarctions was observed in patients on rofecoxib. Further data, from the APPROVe trial, showed a statistically significant relative risk of cardiovascular events of 1. 97 versus placebo — which caused a worldwide withdrawal of rofecoxib in October
2004. Use of methotrexate together with NSAIDs in rheumatoid arthritis is safe if adequate monitoring is done.

Cardiovascular NSAIDs, aside from aspirin, increase the risk of myocardial infarction and stroke. This occurs at least within a week of use. They are not recommended in those who have had a previous heart attack as they increase the risk of death or recurrent MI. Evidence indicates that naproxen may be the least harmful out of these. NSAIDs, aside from aspirin, are associated with a doubled risk of heart failure in people without a history of cardiac disease. In people with such a history, use of NSAIDs was associated with a more than 10-fold increase in heart failure. If this link is proven causal, researchers estimate that NSAIDs would be responsible for up to 20 percent of hospital admissions for congestive heart failure. In people with heart failure, NSAIDs increase mortality risk by approximately 1. 2–1. 3 for naproxen and ibuprofen,

1. 7 for rofecoxib and celecoxib, and 2. 1 for diclofenac.

On 9 July 2015, the Food and Drug Administration toughened warnings of increased heart attack and stroke risk associated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs other than aspirin. The risk and rate of gastric adverse effects are different depending on the type of NSAID medication a person is taking. Indomethacin, ketoprofen, and piroxicam use appears to lead to the highest rate of gastric adverse effects, while ibuprofen and diclofenac appear to have lower rates. Numerous "gastro-protective" drugs have been developed to prevent gastrointestinal toxicity in people who need to take NSAIDs regularly. Gastric adverse effects may be reduced by taking medications that suppress acid production such as proton pump inhibitors, or by treatment with a drug that mimics prostaglandin to restore the lining of the GI tract.

Warfarin drug–drug interactions — scope and key modifiers are outlined: manufacturer labeling lists " > 200 specific agents" that may interfere, yet cross-source concordance is limited with "648 entries" across four sources and "only 50" in common. Pharmacokinetic modifiers include inhibitors of S-warfarin clearance — phenylbutazone, sulfinpyrazone, metronidazole, and trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole — which potentiate prothrombin time (PT), while cimetidine and omeprazole act on the R-isomer and "potentiate the PT only modestly"; amiodarone inhibits clearance of both enantiomers and potentiates warfarin anticoagulation. Inducers that reduce effect include barbiturates, rifampin, azathioprine, and carbamazepine, and long-term alcohol consumption increases clearance; enzyme induction evidence considered rifampin and barbiturates "likely" and interactions with carbamazepine, griseofulvin, aminoglutethimide, nafcilin, and dicloxacillin "probable". Pharmacodynamic potentiators include second-generation and third-generation cephalosporins, thyroxine, and clofibrate, and doses of salicylates of " > 1.5 g per day" may augment effect; acetaminophen potentiates with prolonged use in a randomized, blinded trial, and heparin potentiates but in therapeutic doses produces "only a slight prolongation of the PT".

### Clinical trial data in support of changing guidelines in osteoarthritis treatment [^1143aSjs]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

The limitations of oral NSAIDs

NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen and naproxen, are frequently recommended as effective treatment options for OA. However, this therapy class poses a risk of serious drug interactions in patients also taking warfarin, and regular use of NSAIDs may reduce the cardioprotective effects of daily low-dose aspirin therapy.–Additionally, oral NSAIDs are associated with an increased risk of potentially serious gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and renal AEs, with the level of risk dependent on patient age and the dose and duration of NSAID use.–

One study found that more than 40% of oral NSAID users are at high risk for cardiovascular AEs. This same study also suggested that more than 85% of oral NSAID users are at significant risk for gastrointestinal AEs. The gastrointestinal AEs resulting from oral NSAID use are often asymptomatic and thus unrecognized by patients and providers until they become clinically significant. This may explain, at least in part, the bleeding, perforation, and obstruction events that occur in 1%–2% of patients who use oral NSAIDs. Because this risk of gastrointestinal AEs exists, OA treatment guidelines recommend that oral NSAIDs be used at the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible.

### Practice advisory on the appropriate use of NSAIDs in primary care [^111qJ7oC]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

CONDOR, a large RCT that compared upper and lower GI safety of celecoxib with that of diclofenac plus omeprazole in patients with OA and RA, was the first trial to show that GI risk throughout the GI tract was significantly reduced in patients treated with a COX-2 selective inhibitor compared with a nonselective NSAID. Along with the SUCCESS trial and the MEDAL program, which also showed superior upper GI safety for celecoxib and etoricoxib, respectively, compared with nonselective NSAIDs, these data support the statement that COX-2 selective NSAIDs are superior to nonselective NSAIDs in the prevention of GI adverse events.

The findings of a meta-analysis showing that NSAIDs with high COX-2 selectivity (≥ 5-fold) had a lower association with AKI than NSAIDs with lower (< 5-fold) COX-2 selectivity together with findings from PRECISION showing a lower risk of renal events with celecoxib compared with ibuprofen provide some evidence of differences in renal risk based on individual NSAID selection.

All NSAIDs have features that are useful to highlight from a safety perspective. Among the nonselective NSAIDs, although diclofenac has the least risk of GI side effects, it also has the highest risk of CV events while also associated with increased risk of hepatic impairment. Based on data from PRECISION, ibuprofen not only has a higher risk than celecoxib of GI side effects, but is also associated with a higher risk of new-onset hypertension. In addition, ibuprofen and diclofenac use carries a higher risk of cardiac arrest compared with celecoxib. Based on findings of the MEDAL study, etoricoxib has a comparable risk to diclofenac of thrombotic CV events but a higher risk of renovascular events. Etoricoxib use is also associated with dose-related increases in risk of hypertension, edema and congestive heart failure.

In patients taking aspirin for secondary stroke or coronary thrombosis prevention, COX-2 selective NSAIDs are the drugs of choice due to the potential for COX-1-associated drug–drug interactions and, in particular, the known risks of combining aspirin with ibuprofen. While previous guidelines have recommended that naproxen plus PPI or celecoxib plus PPI can be given in patients with high GI and high CV risk, for patients taking low-dose aspirin the use of celecoxib plus PPI is the better choice. As shown in PRECISION, celecoxib has better overall GI safety than ibuprofen or naproxen despite treatment with low-dose aspirin or corticosteroids.

Interactions of NSAIDs with other drugs

NSAIDs are also differentiated by their potential for pharmacodynamic interactions with other drugs, such as aspirin, corticosteroids, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, which are often administered concomitantly for different reasons. Aspirin irreversibly acetylates the COX active site, preventing generation of TxA 2, a prothrombotic prostanoid involved in platelet activation and aggregation.NSAIDs characterized by a high affinity for platelet COX-1 (eg, ibuprofen, naproxen) may interfere with the antiplatelet effects of aspirin; in contrast, this effect has not been detected with NSAIDs having intermediate or high selectivity for COX-2.–Moreover, no interaction has been detected with low-dose paracetamol. Although further randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm the clinical relevance of these pharmacodynamic interactions, an analysis of the medical records of 7,107 patients with cardiovascular disease who received aspirin alone or aspirin plus an NSAID indicated that the risks of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular-related mortality were significantly higher for patients who received aspirin plus ibuprofen compared with those who received aspirin alone (P < 0.05), but not for patients who received aspirin plus diclofenac or aspirin plus any other NSAID (drugs not specified).

NSAID therapy in patients taking anticoagulant therapy with coumarins (vitamin K antagonists) should also be approached with caution. Coadministration of NSAIDs with coumarins may be associated with an increased risk of bleeding complications, particularly for naproxen. The increased risk of bleeding associated with concomitant use of NSAIDs and coumarins (eg, warfarin) results from displacement of the anticoagulant from plasma proteins by the NSAID, thereby increasing the plasma concentration of free coumarin and associated anticoagulant activity and bleeding risk.

Boxed warnings regarding the use of diclofenac sodium ER PO:
- **Cardiovascular thrombotic events**: do not use in patients undergoing CABG.
- **Cardiovascular thrombotic events**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as NSAIDs have been associated with an increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction and stroke. Avoid using in patients with a recent myocardial infarction.
- Gastrointestinal bleeding, peptic ulcer disease, gastrointestinal perforation: maintain a high level of suspicion, as NSAIDs have been associated with an increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach or intestines, especially in elderly patients and patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or gastrointestinal bleeding.

### Nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drug-induced gastroduodenal injury [^117NKjxN]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This article reviews selected publications related to nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-induced gastroduodenal toxicity in recent years.

Recent Findings

This article provides a comprehensive review of the latest evidence on the epidemiology of NSAID-induced gastroduodenal injury, recommendations on optimal gastroprotective regimens among patients in need of NSAID, risk stratification approach by considering gastrointestinal and cardiovascular risks, and negative interaction between proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and clopidogrel.

Summary

Current evidence indicates that a PPI and a cyclooxygenase (COX)-2-selective NSAID provides the best gastric protection. In light of potential cardiovascular hazard of NSAIDs, physicians should select an NSAID according to individual patients' cardiovascular risk (i.e., naproxen vs. a nonnaproxen NSAID). The choice of gastroprotective therapy depends on the number and nature of gastrointestinal risk factors. PPI co-therapy is recommended in patients with high gastrointestinal risk on aspirin. Whether there is any clinically important interaction between PPIs and clopidogrel remains uncertain.

### Coprescribing proton-pump inhibitors with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: risks versus benefits [^111v35gM]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical impact

Association of NSAIDs with damage to the lower-GI tract has not been widely studied and remains poorly characterized. NSAID-induced enteropathy has recently gained much attention, due to the introduction of new diagnostic modalities, such as capsule endoscopy and device-assisted enteroscopy, as well as the increased use of acetylsalicylic acid and NSAIDs. The clinical significance and frequency of risks and complications with ns-NSAIDs in the lower-GI tract have been increasingly reported. Lower-GI complications also have worse clinical outcomes compared to upper-GI complications (Figure 3):they lead to higher mortality and longer hospitalization. Although PPIs are prescribed together with NSAIDs as a form of gastroprotection, not only do they not inhibit NSAID enteropathybut also frequent use of PPIs can worsen NSAID-induced small-intestine injury by modifying intestinal microbiota.

In recent years, large randomized controlled trials have begun to analyze the effect of NSAIDs on the entire GI tract, rather than just the upper GI tract. In such studies as CONDORand GI-REASONS, the primary end point was defined as clinically significant events occurring throughout the GI tract. It was seen that celecoxib, a COX2 inhibitor, generally caused fewer upper- and lower-GI events compared to such ns-NSAIDs as naproxen, ibuprofen, and diclofenac. Table 3 highlights a comparison of lower-GI outcomes in a few major studies.

Most patients (80%–100%) have active mucosal lesions in the small bowel after 2 weeks of low-dose NSAID and PPI therapy. Evidence from shorter studies in healthy volunteers has also shown that short-term NSAIDs use can also cause NSAID enteropathy. Maiden et al reported that slow-release diclofenac use for 2 weeks resulted in macroscopic injury to the small intestine in up to 75% of subjects. Goldstein et al also reported that the background incidence of small-bowel lesions in healthy adults was not insignificant, and 2 weeks of naproxen plus omeprazole resulted in small-bowel mucosal breaks in more than half of volunteers. In comparison, celecoxib was associated with significantly fewer small-bowel mucosal breaks than naproxen plus omeprazole (17% versus 55%). Another study comparing celecoxib with ibuprofen/omeprazole found similar results (percentage of subjects with small-bowel mucosal breaks was 25.9% for ibuprofen plus omeprazole compared with 6.4% for celecoxib and 7.1% for placebo).

### Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in chronic pain: implications of new data for clinical practice [^1177aXqD]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

NSAIDs are associated with different GI risks, and it is important that this is taken into account in clinical practice. Data from a nested case–control study showed that celecoxib was the only NSAID that did not have a significantly higher rate of upper-GI-tract events compared with placebo. In contrast, the risk of adverse upper-GI-tract events with rofecoxib, ibuprofen, diclofenac, naproxen, and aspirin was significantly higher than in controls. Celecoxib has also been shown to be associated with a significantly lower rate of GI intolerability than naproxen, ibuprofen, or diclofenac in elderly patients (age ≥ 65 years).

The addition of a PPI for ulcer prophylaxis significantly decreases the proportion of NSAID recipients who will develop a gastric or duodenal ulcer during chronic NSAID therapy. In very high-risk subjects (defined as those who had previous NSAID-induced ulcer bleeding and continued need for anti-inflammatory analgesics), combining celecoxib with PPI provides even greater gastroprotection (cumulative incidence of recurrent ulcer bleeding over 13 months' follow-up: 0% for celecoxib+ esomeprazole vs 8.9% for celecoxib alone; P = 0.0004). However, PPIs do not have any protective effects in the lower GI tract. It is also important to note that PPIs are not a risk-free therapy, and thus, care needs to be taken in the setting of long-term PPI use. Adverse events associated with a PPI include increased risk of Clostridium difficile infection and hospital-acquired pneumonia, hypersensitivity with resulting organ damage (eg, interstitial nephritis), increased fractures in postmenopausal women, altered absorption of vitamins and minerals, increased risk of CV complications, and potential for drug interactions.–In addition, PPI treatment has been shown to increase the incidence of small-intestine bacterial overgrowth.

### Low adherence to national guidelines for proton-pump inhibitor prescription in patients receiving combination aspirin and anticoagulation [^111Xd7gW]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction and background

Evidence has long supported the use of low-dose aspirin, defined as 75–325 mg, in both primary and secondary treatment of cardiovascular disease. – At low doses, aspirin irreversibly acetylates cyclooxygenase 1 (COX-1), which blocks the formation of thromboxane A2 and inhibits platelet aggregation. This mechanism produces beneficial antithrombotic effects that help prevent acute cardiovascular events. Despite its clear role in cardiovascular disease prevention, aspirin has been shown to double the risk of major gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and the risk of GIB persists in people who take aspirin for more than 1 year. – Aspirin is thought to promote gastrointestinal (GI) mucosal injury by blocking the COX-1 pathway depleting necessary prostaglandins that protect GI mucosa.

Patients who require aspirin for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease may also require anticoagulation such as warfarin, unfractionated heparin, or low molecular weight heparin for acute coronary syndrome, valvular, arrhythmic, or vascular indications. When anticoagulation therapy is used in combination with aspirin, the risk of clinically significant GIB increases further. – Therefore, a tradeoff must be made between the benefits of cardiovascular disease prevention and the increased risk of GIB. Collaborative guidelines between the American College of Cardiology Foundation (ACCF) Task Force, the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG), and the American Heart Association (AHA) have focused on combining goals of the cardiologist and gastroenterologist to create multidisciplinary recommendations that balance risks and benefits of antiplatelet therapies with interventions to reduce GIB risk. According to the 2008 ACCF/ACG/AHA recommendations, patients who take combination aspirin and anticoagulation therapy should receive a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) to reduce the risk of GIB complications.

To date, several studies have shown low rates of PPI use in patients taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) who are at increased risk for GIB. – However, to our knowledge no such study has examined the rates of PPI use in patients prescribed combination aspirin and anticoagulation therapy. Given that many anticoagulants are started in the inpatient setting for acute indications, the composition of the list of medications prescribed at hospital discharge is an opportunity for patients on anticoagulation treatment who are taking concomitant aspirin to be instructed to take a PPI for GIB prevention. In this study, we aimed to examine adherence to the recommended practice of PPI prescription at hospital discharge in patients receiving combination aspirin and anticoagulation as per the guidelines. We also aimed to identify predictors of adherence to this recommendation so as to guide future interventions aimed at improving primary GIB prevention.

### Management of patients with ulcer bleeding [^115cpQRM]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2012). Medium credibility.

Peptic ulcer bleeding — hospitalization and long-term prevention of recurrent bleeding — Patients with high-risk stigmata (active bleeding, visible vessels, clots) should generally be hospitalized for 3 days assuming no rebleeding and no other reason for hospitalization, and may be fed clear liquids soon after endoscopy (Conditional recommendation). Patients with clean-based ulcers may receive a regular diet and be discharged after endoscopy assuming they are hemodynamically stable, their hemoglobin is stable, they have no other medical problems, and they have a residence where they can be observed by a responsible adult (Strong recommendation). For long-term prevention, patients with H. pylori-associated bleeding ulcers should receive H. pylori therapy, and after documentation of eradication, maintenance antisecretory therapy is not needed unless the patient also requires NSAIDs or antithrombotics (Strong recommendation). In NSAID-associated bleeding ulcers, NSAIDs should not be resumed if possible; if they must be resumed, use a COX-2 selective NSAID at the lowest effective dose plus daily PPI (Strong recommendation). In low-dose aspirin-associated bleeding ulcers, if aspirin is for secondary prevention it should be resumed as soon as possible after bleeding ceases in most patients: ideally within 1–3 days and certainly within 7 days, with long-term daily PPI therapy; for primary prevention, anti-platelet therapy likely should not be resumed in most patients (Conditional recommendation). In idiopathic (non-H. pylori, non-NSAID) ulcers, long-term antiulcer therapy such as daily PPI is recommended (Conditional recommendation).

### Helicobacter pylori and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: interaction with proton pump inhibitor therapy for prevention of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ulcers and ulcer complications – future research needs [^116tH5GB]. The American Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Two recently reported studies of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), the Omeprazole versus Misoprostol for NSAID-induced Ulcer Management and the Acid Suppression Trial: Ranitidine versus Omeprazole for NSAID-associated Ulcer Treatment studies, concluded that omeprazole was superior to a subtherapeutic misoprostol or an ineffective dose of ranitidine for the endpoint, prevention of gastroduodenal ulcers in chronic NSAID users. Helicobacter pylori status was collected prospectively but was not reported. We report separate analyses for patients with unequivocal NSAID ulcers (H. pylori negative) and patients whose NSAID use was complicated by the presence of an active H. pylori infection. Omeprazole was superior to placebo for the prevention of ulcer recurrence in chronic NSAID users. However, omeprazole was not significantly better than a subtherapeutic dose of misoprostol for the prevention of gastroduodenal ulcers in chronic NSAID users. Misoprostol was superior to omeprazole for the prevention of gastric ulcers among those patients with unequivocal NSAID ulcers (8.2% vs 16.6%, respectively; P < 0.05). Omeprazole was not statistically different from misoprostol for gastric ulcer prevention in those whose NSAID use was complicated by an active H. pylori infection. Ranitidine and omeprazole were also not statistically different for the prevention of unequivocal NSAID gastric ulcers (14.6% vs 11.6%, respectively; P = 0.56). That the Misoprostol Ulcer Complications Outcomes Safety Assessment (MUCOSA) trial found full-dose misoprostol to be more effective in ulcer prevention than it was in prevention of ulcer complications suggests that either many of the ulcer complications were related to H. pylori ulcers or that more antisecretory activity than can be provided with misoprostol is needed, or both. The question remains whether the combination of low-dose misoprostol plus an antisecretory drug (either an H(2)-receptor antagonist or a proton pump inhibitor) would provide superior results compared with either alone. That omeprazole was not superior to one half the dose of misoprostol used in the ulcer complication prevention, or MUCOSA, study indicates that it would not be prudent to suggest that ulcer prevention with omeprazole alone would be able to provide similar protection to misoprostol.

### Prevention of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-associated gastrointestinal symptoms and ulcer complications [^112jPoDY]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) produce symptoms of dyspepsia and peptic ulcer disease in up to 50% and up to 20%, respectively, of individuals taking them. Risk factors for NSAID-related gastric injury include age > 70 years, history of ulcer disease, use of multiple agents (e.g., ≥ 2 NSAIDs, or an NSAID plus aspirin — even at cardioprotective doses), high doses of an NSAID, and concurrent use of corticosteroids or anticoagulants. In NSAID users, infection with Helicobacter pylori can produce additive or synergistic gastric mucosal injury. Several clinical strategies can decrease the risk for dyspepsia, ulceration, and the more serious complications in NSAID users. Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) co-therapy has been shown to lower the incidence of dyspepsia in those taking NSAIDs. In those with an active ulcer, PPI therapy produces ulcer healing even in "tough-to-treat" individuals who require ongoing NSAID therapy. Maintenance of ulcer healing is significantly greater in those who receive ongoing PPI treatment compared with placebo, and adverse events and treatment withdrawals are fewer compared with their occurrence in persons treated with misoprostol. In those not receiving aspirin therapy, the use of an NSAID that is a selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 may result in fewer gastrointestinal symptoms compared with a traditional agent; however, studies have failed to show any decrease in healthcare resource utilization (including outpatient or emergency room visits, hospitalization rate, or use of any resource) with COX-2-selective therapy.

Vitamin K antagonist (VKA) drug interactions — NSAIDs and antiplatelet agents: For nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), studies reported odds ratios (ORs) or risk ratios (RRs) from 1.9 (95% CI, 1.4–3.7) to 4.6 (95% CI, 3.3–6.5). COX-2–selective NSAIDs plus VKA showed variable bleeding outcomes, ranging from RR 1.4 (95% CI, 0.44–4.30) to OR 3.1 (95% CI, 1.4–6.7). Antiplatelet agents with VKA were associated with increased rates of bleeding, with estimates from OR 1.5 (95% CI, 1.05–2.2) to hazard ratio (HR) 3.1 (95% CI, 2.3–3.9), and aspirin plus clopidogrel plus VKA vs VKA alone was associated with HR 3.70 (95% CI, 2.89–4.76). Based on these risks, the guideline states, "we suggest avoiding concomitant treatment with NSAIDs, including COX-2-selective NSAIDs, and certain antibiotics (Grade 2C)" and "we suggest avoiding concomitant treatment with antiplatelet agents except in situations where benefit is known or is highly likely to be greater than harm (Grade 2C)".

Coadministration of prasugrel and NSAIDs (used chronically) may increase the risk of bleeding [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1)].

7.3 Opioids

As with other oral P2Y12 inhibitors, coadministration of opioid agonists delay and reduce the absorption of prasugrel's active metabolite presumably because of slowed gastric emptying [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)].

Consider the use of a parenteral anti-platelet agent in acute coronary syndrome patients requiring coadministration of morphine or other opioid agonists.

7.4 Other Concomitant Medications

Prasugrel can be administered with drugs that are inducers or inhibitors of cytochrome P450 enzymes [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)].

Prasugrel can be administered with aspirin (75 mg to 325 mg per day), heparin, GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors, statins, digoxin, and drugs that elevate gastric pH, including proton pump inhibitors and H2blockers [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)].

### Management of patients with ulcer bleeding [^115dSJ1i]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2012). Medium credibility.

Long-term prevention of recurrent bleeding ulcers — recommendations: Patients with H. pylori-associated bleeding ulcers "should receive H. pylori therapy", and after eradication, "maintenance antisecretory therapy is not needed unless the patient also requires non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or antithrombotics" (Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence). For low-dose aspirin–associated bleeding ulcers, the need for aspirin should be assessed; for secondary prevention, "aspirin should be resumed as soon as possible after bleeding ceases in most patients: ideally within 1–3 days and certainly within 7 days", and "Long-term daily PPI therapy should also be provided", whereas for primary prevention "antiplatelet therapy likely should not be resumed in most patients" (Conditional recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). For NSAID-associated bleeding ulcers, if anti-inflammatory drugs are resumed "a COX-2-selective NSAID at the lowest effective dose plus daily PPI is recommended" (Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence). For idiopathic (non-H. pylori, non-NSAID) ulcers, "long-term antisecretory therapy (e.g., daily PPI) is recommended" (Conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence).

### Coprescribing proton-pump inhibitors with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: risks versus benefits [^111HrqDo]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Mechanism

The mechanism of NSAID-induced lower-GI damage is very different from upper-GI damage, and is proportional to the acidity of the molecule used and the extent of increased lower-intestine permeability generated by NSAIDs. This increase in permeability always leads to inflammation. The development of small-intestine inflammation usually starts with an initial increase in small-intestine permeability.

Inhibition of both COX1 and COX2 causes small-bowel damage in the long-term. A capsule-endoscopy study found that even though COX2-selective agents resulted in a lower prevalence of damage compared to ns-NSAIDs, there was still a high prevalence of damage seen with COX2-selective agents. There has also been increasing evidence that COX2 is needed for the maintenance of mucosal integrity and ulcer healing, and thus gastric and intestinal lesions develop only when both COX1 and COX2 are suppressed.ns-NSAIDs are also weakly acidic and are invariably lipophilic, giving them detergent-like properties (Table 2). As such, they interact with phospholipids, an essential constituent of the brush border, causing damage to the surface epithelium. Moreover, lower-GI injury is not dependent on acid production. Therefore, the use of antisecretory agents does not help reduce its incidence. However, a lower p K a value for individualized NSAIDs is associated with increased intestinal permeability.

NSAIDs also uncouple mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, which decreases intracellular adenosine triphosphate concentration. This change results in loss of intercellular integrity, as the intercellular junctions are under the control of adenosine triphosphate-dependent actin– myosin complexes, and hence an increase in intestinal permeability and subsequent mucosal damages.

Many studies have suggested that bacteria also play a role in the pathogenesis of NSAID enteropathy. One key observation is that germ-free rats and mice develop little or no intestinal damage when given an NSAID, but become susceptible to NSAID-enteropathy when colonized by Gram-negative bacteria. A number of studies have also reported protective effects of antibiotics against NSAID enteropathy, particularly when the antibiotics were effective in attenuating Gram-negative bacteria. For example, in a randomized controlled trial in which healthy volunteers were given slow-release diclofenac plus omeprazole and rifaximin extended intestinal release, or slow-release diclofenac plus omeprazole and extended intestinal-release rifaximin, the results showed that fewer rifaximin-treated volunteers developed small-bowel lesions compared with placebo-treated subjects. This strengthens the evidence of the role of enteric bacteria in the development of NSAID enteropathy.

### Contradictions in contraindications for drug-drug interactions [^11697kyA]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2011). Low credibility.

Health-care providers use computerized provider order entry as a component of the electronic medical record system in conjunction with clinical decision support. An important aspect of clinical decision support is screening of drug-drug interactions including contraindications in the labeling approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Currently, there are inconsistencies between the knowledge databases and the official package labeling for contraindications on drug-drug interactions. Unnecessary warnings can cause alert fatigue among clinicians and potentially influence adoption of true contraindications for drug prescribing. Each institution should evaluate the accuracy and completeness of the knowledge databases used for screening of contraindications on drug-drug interactions.

### A COX-2-specific inhibitor plus a proton-pump inhibitor: is this a reasonable approach to reduction in NSAIDs' GI toxicity? [^11142sZW]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

The two prevailing approaches to decrease risks of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-associated gastrointestinal (GI) events are the use of a COX-2 inhibitor or co-therapy with a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI). A major limitation of each approach is that, in patients at the highest risk for NSAID-induced ulcers, neither treatment is effective when used as a stand-alone strategy. An important question is whether combination therapy with a COX-2 inhibitor plus a PPI has improved GI safety compared to a traditional NSAID plus a PPI. This study evaluated high GI risk patients who were taking, along with their NSAID or COX-2 inhibitor, either the PPI, esomeprazole, or the placebo. It confirms that our current approach of adding PPIs to reduce NSAIDs' ulcer risks is an effective strategy. However, this study did not show a safety advantage for using a COX-2 inhibitor instead of a traditional NSAID in high GI risk patients who take PPIs. Thus, there continues to be no prospective data to support a GI benefit of COX-2 inhibitor plus a PPI over traditional NSAID plus a PPI in high-risk patients.

### Naproxen sodium (Naprelan) [^116peUh5]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Boxed warnings regarding the use of naproxen sodium ER PO (also known as Naprelan):
- **Cardiovascular thrombotic events**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as naproxen increases cardiovascular thrombotic event risk (myocardial infarction, stroke), especially in patients with CVD or risk factors. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible and closely monitor patients with CVD or risk factors. Inform patients of symptoms indicating serious cardiovascular events (e.g., chest pain, shortness of breath) and advise them to seek immediate medical attention if they occur.
- **Gastrointestinal bleeding, peptic ulcer disease, gastric perforation**: use extreme caution in patients with peptic ulcer disease/GI bleeding history, or those with risk factors including prolonged treatment, high-risk medications (e.g., aspirin, anticoagulants, SSRIs), smoking, alcohol, advanced age, poor health, liver disease, or coagulopathy, as fatal GI events are more common in elderly or debilitated patients. To minimize GI risks, use NSAIDs at the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration, avoid concurrent NSAID use, monitor closely for GI bleeding, and discontinue therapy if serious adverse events occur, especially in high-risk patients or those taking low-dose aspirin.

### Agreement of different drug-drug interaction checkers for proton pump inhibitors [^113P73Jd]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are among the most commonly prescribed drug classes and are used for both the prevention of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)–induced ulcers and the treatment of acid-related disorders (eg, gastroesophageal reflux disease and peptic ulcer disease). A large body of evidence documented an increased risk of severe adverse drug reactions (ADRs), especially with long-term and inappropriate use of these drugs, also due to pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic drug-drug interactions (DDIs).

PPIs may alter the absorption and bioavailability of medications with pH-dependent solubility by increasing gastric pH. Furthermore, PPIs are mainly metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system, particularly CYP2C19 and CYP3A4, thus potentially modifying the metabolism of coadministered drugs via competitive inhibition. However, intraclass differences in CYP affinity exist. In particular, omeprazole has been shown to carry a relevant potential for DDIs due to its higher affinity for CYP2C19 and moderate affinity for CYP3A4, while pantoprazole has the lowest potential for pharmacokinetic interactions. Furthermore, compared with omeprazole, lansoprazole, esomeprazole, and rabeprazole exhibit a weaker potential for DDIs, although they have been less extensively investigated.

### Practice advisory on the appropriate use of NSAIDs in primary care [^114jd1TE]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Practice Advisory Statement

Screening for CV, GI and Renal Risk Factors Prior to Initiating NSAID Therapy

Age, associated medical comorbidities, previous medical or surgical history, concomitant use of medications (particularly antiplatelet medications, anticoagulants, corticosteroids, ACE inhibitors and SSRIs), H. pylori infection, and BP monitoring should be taken into consideration before initiating NSAID therapy. The use of aspirin increases bleeding risk even at low cardioprotective doses, with bleeding risk also increased when non-aspirin NSAIDs are combined with aspirin. Furthermore, coadministration of aspirin and most other NSAIDs can lead to drug–drug interactions, which is based on competition for access to the acetylation site of platelet-expressed COX-1. Non-aspirin NSAIDs drive the reversible, transient inhibition of platelet aggregation, thus blocking aspirin's irreversible inhibition and potentially allowing clot formation. Although aspirin maintains its cardioprotective benefits in the presence of non-aspirin NSAIDs, the combination of aspirin and ibuprofen has been shown to increase the risk of a CV event.

Several meta-analyses have reviewed the potential for SSRIs to cause upper GI bleeding. All have reported an increased risk of such bleeding when SSRIs are used alone and especially in combination with NSAIDs.–Caution is advised when there is a need to administer both medication classes in combination.

As discussed, H. pylori infection has a high prevalence in Asian patients, which has important implications for potential GI risk. NSAID use and H. pylori infection are independent risk factors for GI complications, with synergism for the development of peptic ulcer and bleeding found when NSAIDs are used in patients with H. pylori infection. Conversely, peptic ulcer disease is rare in people who are negative for H. pylori infection. This provides a rationale for eradicating H. pylori in patients requiring chronic NSAID use. Moreover, eradication of H. pylori prior to the start of long-term NSAID use is associated with a reduced risk of ulcers and appears to be especially effective in NSAID drug-naïve patients.−Patients requiring long-term treatment with NSAIDs and with epigastric pain or dyspepsia, or otherwise assessed as high GI risk, should be referred to a gastroenterologist for a detailed evaluation, including H. pylori testing and possible gastroscopy; those testing positive for H. pylori may be offered eradication therapy.

Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis. Case-control and cohort epidemiological studies showed that concomitant use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and an NSAID may potentiate the risk of bleeding more than an NSAID alone.

Intervention:

Monitor patients with concomitant use of diclofenac with anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin), antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) for signs of bleeding (see PRECAUTIONS; Hematological Toxicity).

Aspirin:

Clinical Impact:

Controlled clinical studies showed that the concomitant use of NSAIDs and analgesic doses of aspirin does not produce any greater therapeutic effect than the use of NSAIDs alone. In a clinical study, the concomitant use of an NSAID and aspirin was associated with a significantly increased incidence of GI adverse reactions as compared to use of the NSAID alone (see WARNINGS; Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation).

Intervention:

Concomitant use of diclofenac and analgesic doses of aspirin is not generally recommended because of the increased risk of bleeding (see

Risk Factors for GI Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation

Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding who used NSAIDs had a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients without these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include longer duration of NSAID therapy; concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, antiplatelet drugs (such as aspirin), anticoagulants; or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); smoking; use of alcohol; older age; and poor general health status. Most postmarketing reports of fatal GI events occurred in elderly or debilitated patients. Additionally, patients with advanced liver disease and/or coagulopathy are at increased risk for GI bleeding.

Complicated and symptomatic ulcer rates were 0.78% at nine months for all patients in the CLASS trial, and 2.19% for the subgroup on low-dose ASA. Patients 65 years of age and older had an incidence of 1.40% at nine months, 3.06% when also taking ASA.
Complicated and symptomatic ulcer rates were 0.78% at nine months for all patients in the CLASS trial, and 2.19% for the subgroup on low-dose ASA. Patients 65 years of age and older had an incidence of 1.40% at nine months, 3.06% when also taking ASA [see Clinical Studies (14.7)].

Strategies to Minimize the GI Risks in NSAID-treated patients:

Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest possible duration.
Avoid administration of more than one NSAID at a time.
Avoid use in patients at higher risk unless benefits are expected to outweigh the increased risk of bleeding. For such patients, as well as those with active GI bleeding, consider alternate therapies other than NSAIDs.
Remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy.
If a serious GI adverse event is suspected, promptly initiate evaluation and treatment, and discontinue celecoxib until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out.
In the setting of concomitant use of low-dose aspirin for cardiac prophylaxis, monitor patients more closely for evidence of GI bleeding [see Drug Interactions (7)].

### The pharmacogenomics of pain management: prospects for personalized medicine [^112JZCKH]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

CYP2C9

Many nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are metabolized by the cytochrome CYP2C9. The gene coding for CYP2C9 is highly polymorphic, with over 50 variants identified. Two frequent allelic variants, CYP2C9✱2 and CYP2C9✱3, are found in poor metabolizers. The incidence of poor metabolizers is highest in the Caucasian population (Table 3).

CYP2C9 polymorphism may play a significant role in NSAID toxicity. Poor metabolizers have reduced CYP2C9 activity compared to wild-type, resulting in reduced NSAID clearance, increased area under the plasma drug concentration–time curve, and possibly an increased risk of adverse effects, although this is controversial. Case reports of patients treated with celecoxib showed that CYP2C9✱3 homozygous patients had seven to ten times lower apparent clearance compared to patients with wild-type CYP2C9. A number of studies have also demonstrated a higher frequency of CYP2C9✱2 and CYP2C9✱3 in individuals who present with gastrointestinal bleeding following NSAID therapy.

Cytochrome drug interactions

Many drugs increase or decrease the activity of CYP isoenzymes, resulting in clinically significant drug–drug interactions (Table 4). For example, apart from NSAID metabolism, CYP2C9 is also heavily involved in the metabolism of warfarin. Allelic variants may slow metabolism and prolong its action, resulting in a compounded effect on bleeding risk when prescribed with NSAIDs. Patients with the CYP2C9✱2 or CYP2C9✱3 genotypes taking both NSAIDs and warfarin have been shown to have significantly elevated prothrombin time, compared to patients with the wild-type variant.

Additional considerations — NSAIDs for post‑abortion pain in individuals with bleeding disorders or on anticoagulation: Nonsteroidal anti‑inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen and ketorolac, are generally recommended as safe and effective options for post‑operative pain without significant associations with increased post‑operative bleeding, hematomas, or complications; in individuals on anticoagulation or with coagulopathies, NSAIDs should be carefully assessed and tailored because most NSAIDs can enhance the activity of oral anticoagulants such as warfarin, apixaban, rivaroxaban, or clopidogrel and potentially increase bleeding risk, and platelet function returns to normal within 10 hours after ibuprofen administration; use of NSAIDs for post‑abortion pain management is generally recommended but should be tailored with attention to possible interaction with anticoagulants.

### Potentially inappropriate medication in community-dwelling primary care patients who were screened positive for dementia [^114ktg77]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2017). Low credibility.

In summary, in contrast to guidelines and recommendations, anticholinergics and benzodiazepines were the most common PIM prescriptions in our analysis. This is consistent with previous evidence suggesting that patients with cognitive impairment and dementia have a higher prevalence of anticholinergic and sedative drug prescriptions than matched controls.

Fifteen percent of the prescribed PIMs were anti-inflammatory and antirheumatic substances from the Priscus list (etoricoxib, indometacin, meloxicam, ketoprofen), which are associated with an increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, ulceration, or perforation, and renal adverse drug effects. The PIMs in this group must be carefully interpreted because, in some cases, treatment with these drugs might be the only option for the patient after considering the individual's health status, possible interactions, and other factors.

The present analysis included the complete medication history of the study participants (prescription drugs and over-the-counter drugs). The considerable percentage of over-the-counter drugs is often missing from studies based on secondary (e.g. reimbursement) data alone. The prevalence of over-the-counter PIM (OTC-PIM) was 4.5% for participants who used PIM. OTC-PIMs included the non-prescription hypnotics (doxylamine, diphenhydramine) and antiemetics (dimenhydrinat). These antihistamines for systemic use are also potentially inappropriate for older people owing to their adverse cognitive effects. Patients or their caregivers rarely inform their GPs about the use of OTC; therefore, it is difficult for physicians to monitor OTC-PIMs and their adverse drug reactions or to estimate their risks of interactions with prescribed medication.

### Antiplatelet drug interactions [^117DCVJp]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Both laboratory studies in healthy volunteers and clinical studies have suggested adverse interactions between antiplatelet drugs and other commonly used medications. Interactions described include those between aspirin and ibuprofen, aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and the thienopyridine, clopidogrel, and drugs inhibiting CYP2C19, notably the proton pump inhibitors (PPI) omeprazole and esomeprazole. Other interactions between thienopyridines and CYP3A4/5 have also been reported for statins and calcium channel blockers. The ibuprofen/aspirin interaction is thought to be caused by ibuprofen blocking the access of aspirin to platelet cyclo-oxygenase. The thienopyridine interactions are caused by inhibition of microsomal enzymes that metabolize these pro-drugs to their active metabolites. We review the evidence for these interactions, assess their clinical importance and suggest strategies of how to deal with them in clinical practice. We conclude that ibuprofen is likely to interact with aspirin and reduce its anti-platelet action particularly in those patients who take ibuprofen chronically. This interaction is of greater relevance to those patients at high cardiovascular risk. A sensible strategy is to advise users of aspirin to avoid chronic ibuprofen or to ingest aspirin at least 2 h prior to ibuprofen. Clearly the use of NSAIDs that do not interact in this way is preferred. For the clopidogrel CYP2C19 and CYP3A4/5 interactions, there is good evidence that these interactions occur. However, there is less good evidence to support the clinical importance of these interactions. Again, a reasonable strategy is to avoid the chronic use of drugs that inhibit CYP2C19, notably PPIs, in subjects taking clopidogrel and use high dose H2 antagonists instead. Finally, anti-platelet agents probably interact with other drugs that affect platelet function such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and clinicians should probably judge patients taking such combination therapies as at high risk for bleeding.

### Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug gastropathy and Helicobacter pylori: the search for an improbable consensus [^113pcRwt]. The American Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and Helicobacter pylori are known to share a number of pathogenic mechanisms, but there is no evidence to show a significant synergistic action between these two risk factors. Studies to assess possible interactions in the pathogenesis of dyspepsia and upper gastrointestinal mucosal lesions have differed in their endpoints, the definition of dyspepsia, and the regimens used for eradication of H. pylori. However, some conclusions may be drawn from the results of clinical trials. As far as dyspepsia is concerned, an association between NSAID dyspepsia and infection with H. pylori, seems likely, but it is difficult to make sense of the discrepant data that are currently available. On the contrary, neither short- nor long-term NSAID administration presents a definite major risk of gastric and duodenal injury or, above all, of ulcer-related complications (bleeding or perforation) in H. pylori-positive patients. Based on these considerations, what recommendations can be made with regard to H. pylori eradication in patients requiring treatment with NSAIDs? H. pylori and anti-inflammatory drugs are probably independent causes of gastric and duodenal damage. Patients taking NSAIDs who are found to have gastric or duodenal ulcers should, therefore, be tested for the bacterium and specifically treated, because H. pylori and NSAID-induced ulcers may be macroscopically indistinguishable. Whether asymptomatic patients taking NSAIDs should be tested and treated for H. pylori infection is still a matter of debate.

### Prevalence of potentially harmful multidrug interactions on medication lists of elderly ambulatory patients [^115uP7p5]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Limitations

There are several limitations to this study. First, we did not take into consideration the doses of the medications that were involved in the MDIs. It is possible that patients were prescribed lower doses of a particular medication than recommended because a second or third drug could influence its metabolism, thus mitigating any potentially amplifying interaction. Second, we cannot say if the medications on the list were intended for daily use or only intermittent use, as needed. Aspirin, which appeared on many lists of patients with MDIs, could have been intended to be taken daily for cardioprotective effects or only as necessary for intermittent pain. Daily aspirin would pose greater risk of an ADE, such as gastric hemorrhage, than if taken only intermittently. Third, identification of three and four MDIs is based on the drug-drug interaction tables at our institution. The identification and rating of various interactions might differ across institutions given that there is significant variability in the drug-drug interaction databases.

### Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole (aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules, 25 mg / 200 mg) [^111V4iZk]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Risk of Bleeding

Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole increases the risk of bleeding. Risk factors for bleeding include the use of other drugs that increase the risk of bleeding (e.g., anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, heparin, anagrelide, fibrinolytic therapy, and chronic use of NSAIDs) [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Intracranial Hemorrhage

In European Stroke Prevention Study-2 (ESPS2), the annualized event rate for intracranial hemorrhage was 0.39%/year in the aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole group, 0.26%/year in the extended-release dipyridamole (ER-DP) group, 0.24%/year in the aspirin (ASA) group, and 0.29%/year in the placebo groups.

Gastrointestinal (GI) Side Effects

GI side effects include stomach pain, heartburn, nausea, vomiting, and gross GI bleeding. Although minor upper GI symptoms, such as dyspepsia, are common and can occur anytime during therapy, physicians should remain alert for signs of ulceration and bleeding, even in the absence of previous GI symptoms. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of GI side effects and what steps to take if they occur.

In ESPS2, the annualized event rate for gastrointestinal bleeding was 2.97%/year in the aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole group, 1.58%/year in the extended-release dipyridamole group, 2.06%/year in the aspirin group, and 1.40%/year in the placebo groups.

Peptic Ulcer Disease

Avoid using aspirin in patients with a history of active peptic ulcer disease, which can cause gastric mucosal irritation and bleeding.

Alcohol Warning

Because aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole contains aspirin, counsel patients who consume three or more alcoholic drinks every day about the bleeding risks involved with chronic, heavy alcohol use while taking aspirin.

5.2	Renal Failure

Avoid aspirin in patients with severe renal failure (glomerular filtration rate less than 10 mL/minute) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Primer: managing NSAID-induced ulcer complications – balancing gastrointestinal and cardiovascular risks [^112NykmF]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2006). Medium credibility.

Ulcer complications associated with the use of NSAIDs, in high-risk patients, are often caused by a failure to identify patients' risk factors, concomitant use of aspirin or multiple NSAIDs, and underutilization of gastroprotective agents. Current data suggest that cyclo-oxygenase 2 (COX2) inhibitors and some nonselective NSAIDs increase the risk of myocardial infarction. Physicians must, therefore, take into account both the gastrointestinal and the cardiovascular risks of individual patients when prescribing NSAIDs. In patients with a low cardiovascular risk, NSAIDs can be prescribed according to the level of gastrointestinal risk. Patients with a moderate gastrointestinal risk (one or two risk factors) should receive a COX2 inhibitor or an NSAID plus a PPI or misoprostol. Patients with more than two gastrointestinal risk factors or prior ulcer complications require the combination of a COX2 inhibitor and a PPI. Patients with a high cardiovascular risk (e.g. coronary heart disease or an estimated 10-year cardiovascular risk greater than 10%) should receive prophylactic aspirin and combination therapy with a PPI or misoprostol irrespective of the presence of gastrointestinal risk factors. Naproxen is the preferred NSAID because it is not associated with excess cardiovascular risk. Patients with a high cardiovascular risk and a very high gastrointestinal risk should avoid using NSAIDs or COX2 inhibitors.

### Celecoxib (celecoxib 400 mg) [^112NSdKf]. FDA (2015). Low credibility.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

General: Celecoxib metabolism is predominantly mediated via cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9 in the liver. Co-administration of celecoxib with drugs that are known to inhibit CYP2C9 should be done with caution. Significant interactions may occur when celecoxib is administered together with drugs that inhibit CYP2C9. In vitro studies indicate that celecoxib, although not a substrate, is an inhibitor of CYP2D6. Therefore, there is a potential for an in vivo drug interaction with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6.

In vitro studies indicate that celecoxib, although not a substrate, is an inhibitor of CYP2D6. Therefore, there is a potential for an in vivo drug interaction with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6.

7.1 Warfarin

Anticoagulant activity should be monitored, particularly in the first few days, after initiating or changing celecoxib therapy in patients receiving warfarin or similar agents, since these patients are at an increased risk of bleeding complications. The effect of celecoxib on the anticoagulant effect of warfarin was studied in a group of healthy subjects receiving daily 2 to 5 mg doses of warfarin. In these subjects, celecoxib did not alter the anticoagulant effect of warfarin as determined by prothrombin time. However, in postmarketing experience, serious bleeding events, some of which were fatal, have been reported, predominantly in the elderly, in association with increases in prothrombin time in patients receiving celecoxib concurrently with warfarin.

7.2 Lithium

In a study conducted in healthy subjects, mean steady-state lithium plasma levels increased approximately 17% in subjects receiving lithium 450 mg twice daily with celecoxib 200 mg twice daily as compared to subjects receiving lithium alone. Patients on lithium treatment should be closely monitored when celecoxib is introduced or with drawn.

7.3 Aspirin

Celecoxib can be used with low-dose aspirin. However, concomitant administration of aspirin with celecoxib increases the rate of GI ulceration or other complications, compared to use of celecoxib alone [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.4) and Clinical Studies (14.6)].

Because of its lack of platelet effects, celecoxib is not a substitute for aspirin for cardiovascular prophylaxis [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

7.4 ACE-inhibitors and Angiotensin II Antagonists

Reports suggest that NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II antagonists. This interaction should be given consideration in patients taking celecoxib concomitantly with ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II antagonists [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2].

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): Combination use increases risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. (7.2)
Warfarin: Combination use increases risk of bleeding. (7.3)

7.1 CYP2C19 Inhibitors

Clopidogrel is metabolized to its active metabolite in part by CYP2C19. Concomitant use of certain drugs that inhibit the activity of this enzyme results in reduced plasma concentrations of the active metabolite of clopidogrel and a reduction in platelet inhibition [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPI)

Avoid concomitant use of Plavix with omeprazole or esomeprazole. In clinical studies, omeprazole was shown to reduce the antiplatelet activity of Plavix when given concomitantly or 12 hours apart. A higher dose regimen of clopidogrel concomitantly administered with omeprazole increases antiplatelet response; an appropriate dose regimen has not been established. A similar reduction in antiplatelet activity was observed with esomeprazole when given concomitantly with Plavix. Consider using another acid-reducing agent with minimal or no CYP2C19 inhibitory effect on the formation of clopidogrel active metabolite. Dexlansoprazole, lansoprazole and pantoprazole had less effect on the antiplatelet activity of Plavix than did omeprazole or esomeprazole [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

7.2 Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)

Coadministration of Plavix and NSAIDs increases the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.

7.3 Warfarin (CYP2C9 Substrates)

Although the administration of clopidogrel 75 mg per day did not modify the pharmacokinetics of S-warfarin (a CYP2C9 substrate) or INR in patients receiving long-term warfarin therapy, coadministration of Plavix with warfarin increases the risk of bleeding because of independent effects on hemostasis.

However, at high concentrations in vitr o, clopidogrel inhibits CYP2C9.

Current evidence suggests that PPIs might be effective in maintaining patients in remission during continued NSAID use and that the combination of omeprazole plus diclofenac is as effective as treatment with celecoxib in preventing recurrent bleeding. Larger outcome studies comparing the combination of a PPI with other nonselective NSAIDs and a selective COX-2 inhibitor (and the combination of a selective COX-2 inhibitor with a PPI or misoprostol) are required to determine whether or not any regimen will further decrease or eliminate the risk of ulcer complications in high-risk individuals.

AGA Clinical Practice Update — best practice advice on discontinuing proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) states that the decision to discontinue PPIs should be based solely on the lack of an indication for PPI use, and not because of concern for PPI-associated adverse events (PAAEs). It further specifies that the presence of a PAAE or a history of a PAAE in a current PPI user is not an independent indication for PPI withdrawal, and that the presence of underlying risk factors for the development of an adverse event associated with PPI use should also not be an independent indication for PPI withdrawal. Supporting context notes that reported associations between PPIs and PAAEs are not necessarily causal and that no RCT has yet demonstrated that PPI users have an increased incidence of any of the PAAEs.

### Ibuprofen [^116ATNX9]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Drug Interactions

ACE-inhibitors

Reports suggest that NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of ACE-inhibitors. This interaction should be given consideration in patients taking NSAIDs concomitantly with ACE-inhibitors.

Aspirin

When ibuprofen tablets are administered with aspirin, its protein binding is reduced, although the clearance of free ibuprofen tablets is not altered. The clinical significance of this interaction is not known; however, as with other NSAIDs, concomitant administration of ibuprofen and aspirin is not generally recommended because of the potential for increased adverse effects.

Diuretics

Clinical studies, as well as post marketing observations, have shown that ibuprofen tablets can reduce the natriuretic effect-of furosemide and thiazides in some patients. This response has been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. During concomitant therapy with NSAIDs, the patient should be observed closely for signs of renal failure (see WARNINGS, Renal Effects), as well as to assure diuretic efficacy.

Lithium

Ibuprofen produced an elevation of plasma lithium levels and a reduction in renal lithium clearance in a study of eleven normal volunteers. The mean minimum lithium concentration increased 15% and the renal clearance of lithium was decreased by 19% during this period of concomitant drug administration. This effect has been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis by ibuprofen. Thus, when ibuprofen and lithium are administered concurrently, subjects should be observed carefully for signs of lithium toxicity. (Read circulars for lithium preparation before use of such concurrent therapy.)

Methotrexate

NSAIDs have been reported to competitively inhibit methotrexate accumulation in rabbit kidney slices. This may indicate that they could enhance the toxicity of methotrexate. Caution should be used when NSAIDs are administered concomitantly with methotrexate.

Warfarin-type anticoagulants

Several short-term controlled studies failed to show that ibuprofen tablets significantly affected prothrombin times or a variety of other clotting factors when administered to individuals on coumarin-type anticoagulants. However, because bleeding has been reported when ibuprofen tablets and other NSAIDs have been administered to patients on coumarin-type anticoagulants, the physician should be cautious when administering ibuprofen tablets to patients on anticoagulants. The effects of warfarin and NSAIDs on GI bleeding are synergistic, such that the users of both drugs together have a risk of serious GI bleeding higher than users of either drug alone.

H-2 Antagonists

In studies with human volunteers, co-administration of cimetidine or ranitidine with ibuprofen had no substantive effect on ibuprofen serum concentrations.

5.16 Interactions with Diagnostic Investigations for Neuroendocrine Tumors

Serum chromogranin A (CgA) levels increase secondary to omeprazole-induced decreases in gastric acidity. The increased CgA level may cause false positive results in diagnostic interventions for neuroendocrine tumors. Temporarily discontinue treatment with ASPIRIN AND OMEPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE TABLETSA at least 14 days before assessing CgA levels and consider repeating the test if initial CgA levels are high. If serial tests are performed (e.g., for monitoring), the same commercial laboratory should be used for testing, as reference ranges between tests may vary [see Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

5.17 Interaction with Methotrexate

Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities. In high-dose methotrexate administration, a temporary withdrawal of ASPIRIN AND OMEPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE TABLETSA may be considered in some patients [see Drug Interactions (7)].

5.18 Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus

NSAIDs including aspirin, may cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. Avoid use of NSAIDs, including ASPIRIN AND OMEPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE TABLETSA, in pregnant women starting at 30 weeks of gestation (third trimester) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

5.19 Abnormal Laboratory Tests

Aspirin has been associated with elevated hepatic enzymes, blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine, hyperkalemia, proteinuria, and prolonged bleeding time.

5.20 Fundic Gland Polyps

PPI use is associated with an increased risk of fundic gland polyps that increases with long-term use, especially beyond one year. Most PPI users who developed fundic gland polyps were asymptomatic and fundic gland polyps were identified incidentally on endoscopy. Use the shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated.

As mentioned above, bleeding complications increase when DOACs are coprescribed with antiplatelets (aspirin, P2Y 12 inhibitors) or agents with antiplatelet properties (NSAIDs, systemic corticosteroids, etc), and these combinations should be minimized whenever possible and carefully balanced against improved thrombosis prevention when clinically indicated. If concomitant therapy cannot be avoided, addition of H2 antihistamine receptor blockers or proton pump inhibitors to mitigate gastrointestinal bleeding should be undertaken.

NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. This interaction should be given consideration in patients taking NSAIDs concomitantly with ACE-inhibitors.

7.4 Diuretics

Clinical studies, as well as post-marketing observations, have shown that NSAIDs can reduce the natriuretic effect of furosemide and thiazides in some patients. The response has been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. During concomitant therapy with NSAIDs, the patient should be observed closely for signs of renal failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)], as well as to assure diuretic efficacy.

7.5 Lithium

NSAIDs have produced an elevation of plasma lithium levels and a reduction in renal lithium clearance. The mean minimum lithium concentration increased 15% and the renal clearance was decreased by approximately 20%. These effects have been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis by the NSAID. Thus, when NSAIDs, including diclofenac, and lithium are administered concurrently, patients should be observed carefully for signs of lithium toxicity.

### Drug insight: aspirin resistance – fact or fashion? [^116Lk9he]. Nature Clinical Practice: Cardiovascular Medicine (2007). Medium credibility.

The term aspirin resistance has been used increasingly in clinical studies. The aim of this Review is to analyze the origin of this term, to discuss the biochemical, functional and clinical correlates of the phenomenon and to offer a conceptual framework to redefine the major determinants of variability between individuals in response to aspirin. Awareness needs to be increased of factors that might interfere with the desired antiplatelet effect of aspirin, particularly in terms of patients' adherence to treatment and avoidable drug interactions with some traditional NSAIDs. Gaining such knowledge could result in improved care of patients and might avoid the requesting of unnecessary platelet function tests of unproven clinical significance.

### Best practices guidelines for acute pain management in trauma patients [^113pLefB]. ACS (2020). High credibility.

Pain management in older adults — standard unidimensional pain rating scales may require modification or be inappropriate for pain assessment in older adults. Physiologic changes that occur with aging may alter both pain perception and response to medications. Because older adults are more sensitive to sedating, gastric irritation, and anticholinergic effects of medications, starting doses need to be empirically reduced. The older adult population is the fastest growing segment of the population, and nearly half of trauma admissions are estimated to involve patients over 65 years by 2050. A complete medical history, including prescription medications, over-the-counter medications, and herbal supplements is essential in order to avoid potentially harmful drug interactions. Age-related declines in hepatic function may reduce drug clearance by up to 40% in the older adult. Decreases in serum albumin concentrations reduce protein binding; increasing distribution volume and free concentration of highly-bound drugs, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Due to changes in body composition, variable reductions in the glomerular filtration rate may be underestimated by standard laboratory values (e.g., serum creatinine). Diminished response by the central nervous system (CNS) to hypercapnia, combined with reduced pulmonary reserve, exaggerates the respiratory depressant effects of opioids and benzodiazepines. Variations in baseline prostaglandin concentrations may increase the risk of both renal and gastrointestinal injury with NSAID use. Decreased cholinergic receptors increase sensitivity to anticholinergic effects of medications.

### Prescription patterns and appropriateness of NSAID therapy according to gastrointestinal risk and cardiovascular history in patients with diagnoses of osteoarthritis [^113udNrY]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Variables related to GI and CV risk classification

The following well known GI risk factors were assessed: age 65 or older; concomitant acetyl salicylic acid (ASA), corticosteroid, or anticoagulant use; previous history of ulcers, ulcer bleeding, or dyspepsia; and the use of two NSAIDs or a high dose of one NSAID (a dose was considered high if the NSAID was prescribed at the maximum dose recommended for the symptomatic treatment of arthritis pain, as described elsewhere. CV low dose ASA was considered any dose 300 mg/day or less. Helicobacter pylori infection was not considered because the proportion of patients from whom this information was available was very low

For the purposes of this study and based on previous reports, we classified patients into three GI categories. Patients at low GI risk were considered to be those without any of the above-mentioned clinical conditions. Patients at moderate GI risk included those with at least one of the following GI risk factors: 1) age 65 or older, 2) concomitant use of low-dose ASA, 3) concomitant use of corticosteroids, 4) history of symptomatic peptic ulcer, 5) history of dyspepsia, 6) current high-dose NSAID use and, 7) current use of two NSAIDs. As described elsewhere, patients at high GI risk were those with either a GI bleeding history, concomitant use of NSAIDs and anticoagulants or the presence of three risk factors of those described for moderate GI risk or any of those factors combined with an uncomplicated peptic ulcer. These combinations were based on the estimated incidence of events obtained from combining different risk factors that would put patients at a similar risk level to those with a history of bleeding peptic ulcers. In this way, in low GI risk patients, the expected rate of upper GI complications should not exceed 1.5 events per 100 patients per year, whereas for those at moderate GI risk, the rate should be between 1.5 to 10, and for high GI risk patients, the rate should be greater than 10 events per 100 patients per year. Patients being treated with anticoagulants (warfarin or coumadin) and NSAIDs were considered high risk, because bleeding events in anticoagulated patients can be more severe.

### New insights into the use of currently available non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [^116PpqFg]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusion

NSAIDs are among the most commonly prescribed and used medications worldwide. However, they are associated with safety and tolerability concerns. There are a number of factors that need to be considered in the selection of an NSAID, including its potency, selectivity for the COX-1 and COX-2 isoforms, pharmacokinetic properties, pharmacodynamic interactions, and the overall impact of these features on tolerability and safety. In addition to the gastrointestinal and cardiovascular safety of NSAIDs, the negative effects of inhibiting prostanoid production on other body systems should be considered. Emerging factors, including biomarkers, may assist clinicians in the selection of appropriate doses and types of NSAIDs. Finally, the individual's clinical background, particularly gastrointestinal and cardiovascular risk factors, should be considered as important determinants that may exacerbate adverse reactions to NSAIDs. The risk factors for cardiovascular and gastrointestinal side effects of NSAIDs are summarized in Table 1. NSAIDs should be used with caution in patients with risk factors for atherothrombotic events. The long-term use of higher doses of NSAIDs represents an independent risk factor for cardiovascular and gastrointestinal adverse events;, therefore, the lowest dose of an NSAID should be used, particularly in patients with other known risk factors.

Current knowledge of factors affecting the safety and tolerability of NSAIDs, including the impact of selectivity, dose, and pharmacokinetics, is being used to guide the development of novel formulations of NSAIDs that address some of these tolerability concerns. For example, a novel immediate-release diclofenac formulation, which has a short half-life, acidic profile, and COX-2 selectivity, has been developed that allows for the use of lower doses (thus reducing systemic exposure and the potential for adverse events) together with rapid attainment of C max, providing sustained analgesia with a rapid onset. Strategies to mitigate the risks and maximize the therapeutic benefits associated with NSAIDs should continue to be employed, such as use of the lowest effective dose for the shortest period of time, use of immediate-release formulations, avoidance of known drug interactions (eg, concomitant use with corticosteroids, low-dose aspirin, or other antiplatelet/anticoagulation events), and limited use of NSAIDs with high gastrointestinal toxicity. Additional strategies for minimizing the risks associated with NSAIDs in individuals with gastrointestinal and/or cardiovascular risk factors are summarized in Table 2.

### Effective and safe proton pump inhibitor therapy in acid-related diseases – A position paper addressing benefits and potential harms of acid suppression [^114xaiMz]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The introduction of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) into clinical practice has revolutionized the management of acid-related diseases. Studies in primary care and emergency settings suggest that PPIs are frequently prescribed for inappropriate indications or for indications where their use offers little benefit. Inappropriate PPI use is a matter of great concern, especially in the elderly, who are often affected by multiple comorbidities and are taking multiple medications, and are thus at an increased risk of long-term PPI-related adverse outcomes as well as drug-to-drug interactions. Herein, we aim to review the current literature on PPI use and develop a position paper addressing the benefits and potential harms of acid suppression with the purpose of providing evidence-based guidelines on the appropriate use of these medications.

Methods

The topics, identified by a Scientific Committee, were assigned to experts selected by three Italian Scientific Societies, who independently performed a systematic search of the relevant literature using Medline/PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane databases. Search outputs were distilled, paying more attention to systematic reviews and meta-analyses (where available) representing the best evidence. The draft prepared on each topic was circulated amongst all the members of the Scientific Committee. Each expert then provided her/his input to the writing, suggesting changes and the inclusion of new material and/or additional relevant references. The global recommendations were then thoroughly discussed in a specific meeting, refined with regard to both content and wording, and approved to obtain a summary of current evidence.

Results

Twenty-five years after their introduction into clinical practice, PPIs remain the mainstay of the treatment of acid-related diseases, where their use in gastroesophageal reflux disease, eosinophilic esophagitis, Helicobacter pylori infection, peptic ulcer disease and bleeding as well as, and Zollinger–Ellison syndrome is appropriate. Prevention of gastroduodenal mucosal lesions (and symptoms) in patients taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or antiplatelet therapies and carrying gastrointestinal risk factors also represents an appropriate indication. On the contrary, steroid use does not need any gastroprotection, unless combined with NSAID therapy. In dyspeptic patients with persisting symptoms, despite successful H. pylori eradication, short-term PPI treatment could be attempted. Finally, addition of PPIs to pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy in patients with refractory steatorrhea may be worthwhile.

Conclusions

Overall, PPIs are irreplaceable drugs in the management of acid-related diseases. However, PPI treatment, as any kind of drug therapy, is not without risk of adverse effects. The overall benefits of therapy and improvement in quality of life significantly outweigh potential harms in most patients, but those without clear clinical indication are only exposed to the risks of PPI prescription. Adhering with evidence-based guidelines represents the only rational approach to effective and safe PPI therapy.

### Management of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-related peptic ulcer bleeding [^115pQJfJ]. The American Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have superseded Helicobacter pylori infection as the most important cause of peptic ulcer bleeding. Eradication of H. pylori in NSAID users will not affect ulcer healing. In high-risk patients with a history of ulcer bleeding, curing H. pylori infection alone without acid suppression has substantially reduced the risk of rebleeding caused by low-dose aspirin but not nonaspirin NSAIDs. In a study comparing the safety profile of misoprostol in combination with NSAID against nabumetone in high-risk patients with a history of ulcer bleeding, both strategies were unable to confer significant protection against the risk of rebleeding.

Prevention of recurrent ulcer bleeding — algorithm by etiology (Figure 2): For H. pylori ulcers, the pathway lists "H. pylori therapy" followed by "Document cure; stop PPI/H2RA". For NSAID-related ulcers, it states "Stop NSAID; if NSAID required, use coxib + PPI". For low-dose aspirin ulcers, branches include "Primary CV prevention" leading to "Do not resume aspirin in most patients", and "Secondary CV prevention" leading to "Resume aspirin soon after hemostasis (e.g., 1–7 days) in most patients and start PPI". For idiopathic ulcers, the action is "Maintenance PPI".

### Adverse drug interactions involving common prescription and over-the-counter analgesic agents [^116r6naF]. Clinical Therapeutics (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Eight analgesic preparations with approved indications for acute pain were among the top 200 drugs prescribed in the United States in 2006. In addition, an estimated 36 million Americans use over-the-counter (OTC) analgesics daily. Given this volume of use, it is not surprising that a number of drug interactions involving analgesic drugs have been reported.

Objectives

This article examines the pharmacologic factors that enhance the clinical relevance of potential drug interactions and reviews the literature on drug interactions involving the most commonly used analgesic preparations in the United States.

Methods

A PubMed search was conducted for English-language articles published between January 1967 and July 2007. Among the search terms were drug interactions, acetaminophen, aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, celecoxib, NSAIDs, hydrocodone, oxycodone, codeine, tramadol, OTC analgesics, alcohol, ethanol, antihypertensive drugs, methotrexate, warfarin, SSRIs, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline, citalopram, serotonin syndrome, MAOIs, and overdose. Controlled clinical trials, case-control studies, and case reports were included in the review.

Results

A number of case reports and well-controlled clinical trials were identified that provided evidence of the relatively well known drug-drug interactions between prescription/OTC NSAIDs and alcohol, antihypertensive drugs, high-dose methotrexate, and lithium, as well as between frequently prescribed narcotics and other central nervous system depressants. In contrast, the ability of recent alcohol ingestion to exacerbate the hepatotoxic potential of therapeutic doses of acetaminophen is not supported by either case reports or clinical research. Use of ibuprofen according to OTC guidelines in patients taking cardioprotective doses of aspirin does not appear to interfere with aspirin's antiplatelet activity, whereas chronic prescription use of ibuprofen and other NSAIDs may interfere. Low-dose aspirin intake appears to abolish the gastroprotective effects of cyclooxygenase-2-selective inhibitors, including celecoxib. There is evidence of other less well known and potentially clinically significant drug-drug interactions, including the ability of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors to inhibit the analgesic activity of tramadol and codeine through inhibition of their metabolic activation, to induce serotonin syndrome when used chronically in the presence of high doses of tramadol through synergistic serotonergic action, and to increase the potential for gastrointestinal bleeding associated with NSAID therapy through additive or supra-additive antiplatelet activity.

Conclusions

Considering the widespread use of analgesic agents, the overall incidence of serious drug-drug interactions involving these agents has been relatively low. The most serious interactions usually involved other interacting drugs with low therapeutic indices or chronic and/or high-dose use of an analgesic and the interacting drug.

### Coprescribing proton-pump inhibitors with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: risks versus benefits [^116qwspC]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are often coadministered with proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) to reduce NSAID-induced gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events. This coadministration is generally regarded as safe, and is included in many of the guidelines on NSAID prescription. However, recent evidence indicates that the GI risks associated with NSAIDs can be potentiated when they are combined with PPIs. This review discusses the GI effects and complications of NSAIDs and how PPIs may potentiate these effects, options for prevention of GI side effects, and appropriate use of PPIs in combination with NSAIDs.
