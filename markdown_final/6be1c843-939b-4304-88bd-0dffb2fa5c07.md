## Question

Differential for 58 yo male with unilateral disc edema

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to evaluate unilateral optic disc edema in a 58-year-old man. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate triage and whether this is an ophthalmic or neurologic emergency. Then, I should verify how visual function guides the differential and the initial imaging strategy. Next, I will consider pseudoedema versus true edema with multimodal imaging. After that, I will prioritize the differential by age and acuity, including NAION, MOGAD-ON, neuroretinitis, papilledema, and optic perineuritis. Then, I should outline a staged diagnostic workup with labs, MRI, and lumbar puncture indications. Finally, I will synthesize management pathways and highlight pitfalls and special scenarios that could alter management, ensuring each step is supported by evidence and that I double-check assumptions as I go.

> Let me first confirm the urgency and triage steps. Unilateral disc edema in a 58-year-old man can reflect vision-threatening optic neuropathy or a harbinger of intracranial pathology, so I need to check for red flags such as acute painful vision loss, altitudinal field defect, systemic GCA symptoms, or focal neurologic deficits, and I should not delay urgent neuro-ophthalmology input and appropriate imaging when indicated [^112xaNFv] [^114K5oU9].

> Wait, let me verify how visual function steers the differential. If visual acuity, color vision, and fields are normal, pseudoedema such as optic disc drusen becomes more likely, whereas any measurable deficit pushes me toward true edema from ischemic, inflammatory, infectious, compressive, or papilledema-related causes. This functional anchor is foundational to avoid unnecessary neuroimaging when pseudoedema is likely [^114K5oU9] [^112xaNFv].

> I will now examine the distinction between pseudoedema and true edema because misclassification leads to misdirected testing. Fundus examination alone cannot reliably distinguish ODD from papilledema or other edema, so I need to check for autofluorescence and use enhanced-depth imaging OCT to detect superficial or buried drusen; if drusen are present, I should confirm there is no concurrent edema, as ODD can coexist with papilledema, AION, or uveitis, which changes management entirely [^116YknEg] [^111tCKNU] [^114AXdEi].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about papilledema just because the disc is swollen. Truly unilateral papilledema is uncommon but reported, so if I suspect raised intracranial pressure, I should confirm with brain and orbit MRI with contrast and venography, and then proceed to lumbar puncture with opening pressure when imaging supports IIH or when the phenotype is atypical for IIH demographics; I need to ensure I do not miss venous sinus thrombosis or mass lesions in this evaluation [^114ayE6S] [^114K5oU9] [^1122UTmj].

> Next, I should review the leading etiologies in this age group. Nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy is the most common acute optic neuropathy in patients over 50, typically presenting with sudden, painless, unilateral vision loss, altitudinal field defect, hyperemic disc edema, and a relative afferent pupillary defect. I should double-check for vascular risk factors and a crowded disc configuration, and remember that pallid edema can rarely occur in severe atherosclerotic NAION, which can mimic arteritic disease [^114AXdEi] [^116amWz2].

> But wait, what if the pain is prominent and the patient is older than the classic MOGAD age range. MOG antibody-associated optic neuritis can occur in older adults and may mimic NAION, yet features such as eye pain with movement, less pronounced disc edema on OCT, perineural optic nerve sheath enhancement, and better visual recovery after steroids favor MOGAD; I should confirm with MOG-IgG testing and orbital MRI when clinical suspicion is moderate to high, especially if the course is atypical for NAION [^114yQqUZ] [^113qXgo1] [^115Xx7RJ].

> I need to check for infectious and inflammatory mimics that present with unilateral disc edema and may show a macular star. Neuroretinitis from Bartonella, Toxoplasma, or Toxocara can produce disc edema with subsequent macular exudates and requires targeted serologies; I should confirm exposure risks and systemic symptoms, and remember that macular star formation may lag the disc edema by days to weeks, so absence early does not exclude the diagnosis [^116pwsZV] [^1129r4er] [^11176Sh5].

> Let me consider optic perineuritis, which can produce unilateral disc edema with preserved or mildly reduced function and may be idiopathic or associated with systemic inflammatory disease. MRI showing optic nerve sheath enhancement supports this diagnosis, and I should confirm with appropriate inflammatory labs and, if indicated, CSF analysis to exclude infectious or granulomatous etiologies [^114K5oU9] [^112fg2NK].

> I should double-check for less common but critical causes. Arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy from giant cell arteritis must be excluded in any patient over 50 with new optic neuropathy, even without systemic symptoms; I need to check ESR and CRP urgently and arrange temporal artery biopsy, recognizing that unilateral biopsy is often sufficient when clinical suspicion is low, and that pale, chalky-white disc edema heightens concern for arteritic disease [^112vABV1] [^116B9o6i].

> Next, I should review the staged diagnostic workup to keep this organized. Immediately, I will obtain a comprehensive ophthalmic examination with color vision, pupils, intraocular pressure, dilated fundus exam, and formal perimetry. I will order OCT with EDI and autofluorescence to assess for ODD and quantify pRNFL thickening, and I will obtain a contrast-enhanced brain and orbit MRI with MR venography if any visual function is abnormal or if papilledema is suspected. If MRI suggests raised intracranial pressure or the phenotype is atypical for IIH, I will perform lumbar puncture with opening pressure and CSF analysis. Concurrently, I will order targeted labs including CBC, ESR/CRP, metabolic panel, syphilis serology, and Bartonella testing when exposure is plausible, reserving MOG-IgG and AQP4-IgG for inflammatory suspicions [^114K5oU9] [^111tCKNU] [^1122UTmj].

> Hold on, I should verify management pathways by diagnosis so I do not conflate treatments. For NAION, there is no proven acute therapy, so I will optimize vascular risk factors, treat sleep apnea, and avoid hypotension while monitoring for fellow eye involvement. For MOGAD-ON, high-dose IV methylprednisolone followed by a taper and consideration of long-term immunosuppression is standard. For papilledema from IIH, acetazolamide and weight management are first-line, with neurosurgical options for refractory cases. For neuroretinitis, organism-directed antibiotics are indicated for Bartonella or Toxocara. For arteritic AION, immediate high-dose IV steroids are required while arranging biopsy. For ODD without edema, reassurance and visual field monitoring suffice, but if edema is present, I must treat the underlying cause rather than the drusen itself [^116Jp5fY] [^114yQqUZ] [^116pwsZV] [^112vABV1] [^114AXdEi].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost overlooked a few pitfalls that commonly derail diagnosis. Deeply buried ODD can be missed on routine exam and only revealed by EDI-OCT, leading to mislabeling as atypical optic neuritis. Chemotherapy-associated optic neuropathy and drug-induced NAION, including agents like semaglutide and sildenafil, should be in the medication history. And although LHON typically presents earlier, rare late-onset cases can occur, so I should confirm with mitochondrial testing if the phenotype fits and other causes are excluded [^114AXdEi] [^1135rFR5] [^114SLi5B] [^115cJnkH] [^113r23FR].

> Let me reconsider the overall algorithm to ensure internal consistency. Start with visual function to separate pseudoedema from true edema, use multimodal imaging to confirm ODD when suspected, and if true edema is present, obtain urgent MRI of brain and orbits with contrast and venography to exclude mass, venous thrombosis, or optic nerve sheath enhancement, then tailor labs and LP to the leading differential. This stepwise approach minimizes unnecessary testing while catching sight- or life-threatening entities early [^114K5oU9] [^111tCKNU].

In a 58-year-old man with unilateral disc edema, the most likely causes are **non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION)** [^112xaNFv] and **optic disc drusen (ODD)** [^114K5oU9]. NAION presents with sudden, painless vision loss, altitudinal field defect, and a crowded disc [^116Jp5fY]; ODD is often asymptomatic or causes gradual field loss and is best confirmed by autofluorescence or EDI-OCT [^114K5oU9]. Other considerations include **arteritic AION** (pale disc, systemic symptoms, elevated ESR/CRP) [^112vABV1], **optic neuritis** (pain with eye movements, young adults, MRI) [^115RiEJ9], **neuroretinitis** (macular star, cat exposure) [^116pwsZV], **papilledema** (bilateral, headache, MRI/MRV, LP) [^1122UTmj], and **compressive lesions** (slow, progressive, MRI) [^114K5oU9]. Workup should include visual acuity/fields, color vision, OCT, autofluorescence, MRI brain/orbits with contrast and venography, and labs (ESR/CRP, syphilis, Bartonella, MOG/AQP4) [^114K5oU9] [^111tCKNU].

## Initial clinical evaluation

- **Visual acuity and color vision**: Assess for optic neuropathy [^115Z2EUV].

- **Visual fields**: Altitudinal defect (NAION), central scotoma (optic neuritis), enlarged blind spot (papilledema) [^115m4pAk].

- **Pupillary examination**: Relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) in unilateral optic neuropathy [^1148sN7G].

- **Fundus examination**: Disc edema, hemorrhages, macular star, cup-to-disc ratio [^116Jp5fY].

---

## Essential diagnostic tests

- **Optical coherence tomography (OCT)**: Quantify disc edema, detect ODD, macular involvement [^111tCKNU].

- **Autofluorescence imaging**: Identify ODD [^114K5oU9].

- **MRI brain and orbits with contrast and venography**: Exclude compressive lesions, papilledema, optic neuritis [^114K5oU9].

- **Laboratory tests**: ESR/CRP, syphilis serology, Bartonella, MOG/AQP4 antibodies [^112zY1Qp] [^11176Sh5] [^112atezq].

---

## Management considerations

- **NAION**: No proven treatment; manage vascular risk factors [^116Jp5fY].

- **AAION**: High-dose IV steroids, urgent temporal artery biopsy [^116Hz17T].

- **Optic neuritis**: High-dose IV steroids; long-term immunotherapy if MOGAD/NMOSD [^112atezq].

- **Neuroretinitis**: Treat underlying infection (e.g. doxycycline for Bartonella) [^116pwsZV].

- **Papilledema**: Treat underlying cause (e.g. acetazolamide for IIH, neurosurgery for mass) [^115S6HWp].

- **ODD**: Observation unless symptomatic [^notfound].

---

In a 58-year-old man with unilateral disc edema, prioritize **NAION**, **ODD**, **AAION**, **optic neuritis**, **neuroretinitis**, **papilledema**, and **compressive lesions**. Use clinical features, OCT, autofluorescence, MRI, and targeted labs to guide diagnosis and management [^112xaNFv].

### Incidental multiple myeloma in a patient with neuroretinitis: a case report [^115dnCqA]. BMC Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Neuroretinitis is classically defined as a clinical triad of unilateral, painless vision loss, accompanied by optic disc edema and characteristic macular star formation. The causes of neuroretinitis can be categorized as infectious, non-infectious, and idiopathic, therefore differential diagnosis and careful evaluation are required, owing to the various etiologies and masqueraders.

Case Presentation

A 54-year-old woman presented to the clinic with blurred vision in both eyes. A complete ophthalmic examination revealed optic disc edema with blurred margins and macular exudates, intraretinal edema in the temporal peripapillary area, and subretinal fluid with neurosensory retinal detachment in the macular area. Systemic laboratory investigations showed no signs of infection or inflammation. However, bone marrow suppression was suspected based on the results of the complete blood count test, and the patient was diagnosed with multiple myeloma.

Conclusion

Although neuroretinitis is rarely accompanied by hematological malignancy, it is important to be mindful of the latter because ophthalmic manifestations are a common feature of hematological malignancies and lesions occur in nearly every ocular structure.

### Acute optic neuritis diagnosed by bedside ultrasound in an emergency department [^114XCHE1]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Transorbital ultrasound was used to diagnose acute optic neuritis (AON) at bedside in an emergency department (ED).

Case Report

A 59-year-old female patient presented to an ED after 7 days of progressive unilateral visual loss while she was receiving outpatient treatment for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. Transorbital ultrasound revealed a disparity between the optic nerve sheath diameters of the affected and nonaffected eyes and striking optic nerve edema in the affected eye. These findings led to a diagnosis of AON and early definitive treatment. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Given an absence of reliable diagnostic criteria for AON, comorbidity with multiple sclerosis, and limitations inherent to magnetic resonance imaging, transorbital sonography may facilitate diagnosis of this condition in emergent presentations.

### Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy in patients treated with semaglutide: report of four cases with a possible association [^114SLi5B]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) is a leading cause of sudden vision loss, primarily affecting middle-aged and elderly individuals. Its hallmark features are an acute unilateral painless onset of visual impairment, relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) and hyperemic optic disc swelling. Common risk factors include structural predispositions, such as a crowded optic disc and optic disc drusen (ODD), and systemic conditions like sleep apnea syndrome, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, nocturnal hypotension, diabetes mellitus, and hypercoagulability.

Semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA), has become an integral component of weight management and type 2 diabetes treatment due to its potent efficacy in glycemic control and cardiovascular risk reduction. Despite its widespread use, studies have suggested a possible association between semaglutide and NAION. This potential risk raises questions about the ocular safety of GLP-1 RAs, in particularly the need for identifying predisposed individuals.

This case series presents four instances of NAION in patients receiving semaglutide therapy.

### Optic disc edema with decreased visual function after high-altitude exposure [^112zY1Qp]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Testing for risk factors associated with NAION

To identify risk factors associated with nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), we evaluated the following parameters: cup-to-disc ratio, blood pressure, blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin, lipid profile, 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure, and polysomnography. These factors are considered important in the pathogenesis of NAION, including small cup-to-disc ratio and small optic discs, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, and sleep apnea. Additionally, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), and autoimmune-related antibodies were assessed to exclude giant cell arteritis and other possible differential diagnoses.

### Unilateral vision loss with a macular star… [^11176Sh5]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

Question Discussion The correct answer is D: neuroretinitis. Optic disc swelling and star-shaped macular exudates describe the findings of neuroretinitis. In this case, it was idiopathic and the patient made a complete recovery by one year without specific treatment. Most cases of neuroretinitis are idiopathic; however, the diagnosis requires excluding the most common infectious causes: syphilis, toxoplasmosis, cat-scratch disease, and Lyme disease. 1 Hepatitis B and tuberculosis also have been reported to cause neuroretinitis. The differential diagnosis for unilateral optic disc swelling with macular star includes hypertensive retinopathy, diabetic optic neuropathy, papillophlebitis, anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, optic neuritis of infectious and noninfectious origin, optic nerve head tumors, and neuroretinitis. 1, 2. In 1916, Leber 3 described patients with unilateral vision loss, optic disc edema, and macular stars.

These patients had no identifiable causes for these symptoms and their vision recovered spontaneously. The pathogenic locus of this syndrome later was found to be at the optic nerve head, and the observed exudate resulted from leakage of the disc capillaries that had extended into the macular area along the plane of the outer plexiform layer. 4 The serous component of the exudate resorbed, whereas the residual lipids and proteins formed the characteristic macular star. 4 Most cases are unilateral, with bilateral involvement reported in 5 to 33 percent of patients. 1 Affected persons usually are healthy. Neuroretinitis is believed to be caused by a non-specific viral infection because associated flu-like symptoms occur in about one half of patients. Optic disc swelling is the earliest sign and usually is diffuse. The macular star may be present at the onset of disease or may not be apparent until one to two weeks later.

The other differential diagnoses are not compatible with the clinical presentation. Hypertensive papilledema, brain tumor, or any other etiologies resulting in high intracranial pressure commonly are associated with bilateral optic disc swelling. Optic neuritis has prominent relative afferent pupillary defect of the involved eye, and it seldom causes any macular exudates or macular star. Ischemic optic neuropathy also has a remarkable relative afferent pupillary defect. Disc swelling may not be uniform or may be pale in color if the underlying disease is giant cell arteritis.

### An unusual cause for an optic disc haemorrhage [^116oKnym]. BMJ Case Reports (2011). Medium credibility.

A 51-year-old male on chemotherapy for myeloma presented initially with a unilateral optic disc haemorrhage and signs of optic neuropathy. This rapidly progressed to affect both eyes and within a few days he developed retinal features suggestive of progressive outer retinal necrosis. He was treated with intravenous acyclovir that was subsequently changed to ganciclovir when serological tests for cytomegalovirus were found to be positive for immunoglobulin M antibodies. His visual loss continued to deteriorate despite treatment, and he subsequently developed a retinal detachment in one eye. The causes of optic neuropathy in immunocompromised patients and the importance of eliminating an infective cause are discussed.

### Giant cell arteritis: the experience of two collaborative referral centers and an overview of disease pathogenesis and therapeutic advancements [^112vABV1]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Arteritic Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (A-AION)

Consistent with the data reported in the literature, A-AION was the most frequent ocular manifestation in our cohort of patients (Figure 6). A-AION is the product of inflammation, thrombosis, and the consequent ischemia of the short posterior ciliary arteries (PCAs) originating from the ophthalmic artery. Most people have two PCAs, whereas some have only one and others as many as five. Fluorescein fundus angiography studies have shown that the medial PCA is more frequently occluded, which results in infarction of the optic nerve head.

As reported for the majority of the patients described in Table 1, in addition to the systemic symptoms typical of GCA but absent in patients with occult GCA, ocular manifestations include a rapidly developing, mostly unilateral loss of vision associated with severely reduced visual acuity and/or altitudinal visual field defects. Ophthalmoscopy reveals (Figure 7A and B) a pale, edematous, chalky-white optic disc that less commonly may show hyperemic swelling, an ophthalmoscopic picture quite similar to that of patients with non-A-AION. Flame hemorrhages adjacent to the disc and narrowing of the peripapillary retinal arterioles may also be seen. In less ominous situations, only a segment of the optic disc is affected, but this occurs in < 25–30% of patients.

Figure 7
Scanning laser ophthalmoscopy and fluorangiography patterns in a GCA patient with acute ischemia of the papilla. Pale colored edema and light swelling are evident on the optic disc (panels A and B). Four months later the pattern changed to optic nerve atrophy (panel C).

Optical coherence tomography (OCT) angiography may help to identify microvascular defects and vessel density reduction in patients with acute optic disc edema, thus providing useful clues in assessing ischemia in the optic nerve head. In addition, three-dimensional high-resolution black-blood MRI enables a more reliable and earlier diagnosis of PCA involvement in these patients than achieved with funduscopy. This capability is particularly useful in the detection of "vision-at-risk" in patients with suspected GCA in whom the funduscopy findings are unremarkable.

### Relapsing-remitting, corticosteroid-sensitive, varicella zoster virus optic neuritis [^114YSYhg]. Pediatric Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

We report a 13-year-old male who presented with bilateral disc edema after a febrile illness. Rapid loss of vision prompted corticosteroids treatment, which reversed the visual loss and optic disc findings. Both his visual function and disc edema proved exceedingly sensitive to steroids, and he required increasingly slow and prolonged corticosteroids taper to avoid relapse over a period of 1 year. Ultimately, profound visual loss was reversed three times and only after exceptionally slow steroid weaning. Comprehensive systemic investigations and neuroimaging were initially unrevealing. Late in the course of disease, evidence of seroconversion was identified in his serum and cerebrospinal fluid with positive varicella zoster virus antibodies titers. Varicella zoster virus-related optic nerve pathology may present clinically with profound visual loss and disc edema and may reverse only with high-dose corticosteroids treatment. Physicians should carefully consider retesting with late varicella zoster virus titer in patients with relapsing-remitting, steroid-sensitive optic neuritides.

### Case series of neuroretinitis in Korea [^1129r4er]. BMC Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

This cohort includes four etiologies; Toxocara, Toxoplasma, Dengue virus, and idiopathic. A representative case of each etiology is described below.

Case 11

A 58-year-old man presented with decreased visual acuity in the right eye that went on for 2 weeks. He drank liquor made with hand-picked wild fruit 2 weeks prior to his initial visit. He had experienced headaches the day after drinking the liquor, and developed a central scotoma in the right eye 2 days following the onset of the headaches. The BCVA was 20/40 in the right eye and 20/20 in the left eye.

Fundus photography (Fig. 1 A) and OCT (Fig. 1 B) showed optic disc edema and subretinal fluid in the right eye. Laboratory test results were positive for Toxocara antibodies. Oral albendazole (1200 mg/day) was prescribed for 7 days. After 1 month, the subretinal fluid disappeared on OCT (Fig. 1 D), and optic disc edema improved on fundus photography (Fig. 1 C). Stellate macular deposits were observed on fundus photography and OCT (Fig. 1 C and D).

Fig. 1

Fundus photo showed optic disc edema of the right eye during his initial visit (A), optical coherence tomography of the right eye showed subretinal fluids (B), and optic disc edema (white circle). 1 month after albendazole treatment, optic disc edema disappeared and hard exudates were clearly noticed in the fundus photo (C). In the optical coherence tomography, subretinal fluid was nearly absent and hard exudates became more distinct (D)

### Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) associated optic neuritis in a patient with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) and compressive optic neuropathy case report [^112Lb3Uu]. BMC Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Table 1
Prior cases of MOGAD associated with increased intracranial pressure mimicking IIH compared to the case presented

NA - not available, HA - Hand motion, CF - count fingers, ONSE - Optic Nerve Sheath Enhancement, *Criteria for study was MOG positive titer.

MOGAD can present bilaterally and with optic disc edema, in contrast to typical optic neuritis from multiple sclerosis which is usually unilateral and associated with a normal fundus or mild if any optic disc edema. In addition, optic nerve sheath enhancement has been shown to be a differentiating and distinctive finding for MOGAD (see table) that is not typically seen in IIH or MS-related optic neuritis. Finally, although macular edema can rarely be seen in optic neuritis this finding has been reported in MOGAD.

This patient has a very unusual case of MOG-related optic neuritis which was complicated by the presence of a pituitary adenoma 15 years after the initial presenting symptoms. Either MOG-related optic neuritis manifested as IIH from the beginning of this patient's history or it developed in the setting of a long-standing IIH. Clinicians should be aware that IIH symptoms (e.g. fulminant IIH) can mirror MOGAD-related optic disc edema. Orbital and cranial MRI should be performed to evaluate for optic nerve sheath enhancement which can be more suggestive of MOGAD than IIH. In addition to having a positive titer, LP may also exhibit inflammatory CSF indices, which could be the cause of the elevated ICP caused by MOGAD, however, there are many cases reported of MOGAD masquerading as IIH which had no inflammatory markers noted in the CSF as shown in Table 1 similar to this patient's first CSF study.

We believe that our case highlights the importance of considering MOGAD in the differential diagnosis of any acute bilateral optic neuropathy. Acute fulminant presentations of IIH can produce a similar clinical picture to MOGAD. Likewise lack of visual improvement despite adequate neurosurgical decompression of a pituitary adenoma should also prompt consideration for testing for MOGAD. In addition, clinicians should consider imaging of the orbit and brain with contrast in cases of fulminant, progressive, or atypical IIH and in cases of compressive optic neuropathy which do not recover following surgical decompression. The presence of optic nerve sheath enhancement on orbital MRI should prompt consideration for MOGAD.

### Acute unilateral vision loss with optic disc oedema in retinitis pigmentosa [^116m8ryM]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

A 36-year-old woman presented with acute vision loss and was found to have disc oedema and retinitis pigmentosa (RP). She presented with a history of acute, painless vision loss in her left eye over a period of 10 days. Her best-corrected visual acuity was 20/50, N6 in the right eye (OD) and 20/160, N6 in the left eye (OS). She was found to have a swollen optic disc and the examination of her fundus showed changes suggestive of RP. The diagnosis of RP was confirmed by electroretinogram, and after ruling out demyelinating changes in the central nervous system and other possible infectious causes of papillitis, she was treated with intravenous steroids followed by a course of oral steroid therapy. Following treatment, her visual acuity improved to 20/60. Acute vision loss may occur in patients with RP and prompt steroid therapy may result in partial visual recovery.

### Updates on ophthalmic imaging features of optic disc drusen, papilledema, and optic disc edema [^114AXdEi]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

OPTIC DISC DRUSEN WITH CONCURRENT OPTIC DISC EDEMA

Optic disc drusen with superimposed optic disc edema

A minority of patients with ODD may have concurrent optic disc edema. In a study of 102 patients with ODD (mean 37 years, range 8–90 years), 11% was found to have coexistent optic disc edema because of papilledema (46%), nonarteritic AION (30%), or uveitis (7%). Although thickening of the retinal nerve fiber layer analysis on OCT is a common finding in papilledema, this measurement alone does not adequately identify those with ODD and concurrent optic disc edema. In contrast, the presence of retinal and choroidal folds in en face imaging may be more specific for optic disc edema in ODD.

Optic disc drusen with anterior ischemic optic neuropathy

Eyes with ODD are at risk for acute visual loss because of vascular compromise and ischemia. An example of AION in the setting of ODD (ODD-AION) is shown in Fig. 1 c. On color imaging, there is prominent optic disc edema that spreads into the peripapillary area, and on autofluorescence imaging, the optic disc border is much enlarged and indistinct because of optic disc edema and displacement of the normally bright lipofuscin-containing RPE (Fig. 1 c).

AION is the most common ischemic complication in young patients with bilateral and buried ODD, and ODD eyes are also at risk for retinal artery or vein occlusion and choroidal neovascularization. Nonarteritic AION is the most common acute optic neuropathy in patients older than 50 years old, with incidence of 2.3–10.2 cases per 100,000 persons 50 years of age or older. In studies of young onset nonarteritic AION (range 15–50 years), slightly more than 50% of patients had ODD-AION compared with 2% in general population. Comparison of patients with ODD-AION and nonarteritic AION (similar age) reveals that significantly more ODD-AION patients have no vascular risk factors, consistent with ODD as an independent risk factor for AION.

### Inpatient consultations for ophthalmology – 2025 [^111R7G55]. AAO (2025). High credibility.

Papilledema — consult patterns and triage outcomes indicate that at a major academic hospital in 2022, a total of 153 patients were evaluated and 89 (58%) had bilateral optic disc edema; a follow-up study using ED-based nonmydriatic fundus photography and optical coherence tomography (OCT) with remote teleconsultation reduced median ED/hospital length of stay by 56% and mostly avoided in-person ophthalmology consultation.

### Optic disc edema with decreased visual function after high-altitude exposure [^115E3prR]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In 1969, Singh et al. described four cases of optic nerve head swelling among 1925 male soldiers who had ascended to altitudes between 11,000 and 18,000 feet (3300–5500 m); this was the first report of optic disc edema at high altitude. Since then, optic disc edema has been reported in mountaineers with high-altitude cerebral edema. Bosch et al. found that the incidence rate of optic disc swelling at very high altitudes (7546 m) is 59%. Another study showed a high prevalence (79%) of clinical optic disc edema in high altitudes (4559 m). The edema is typically bilateral and is thought to be associated with cerebral edema and increased cerebrospinal fluid pressure. Almost all patients experience complete regression upon returning to low altitudes and do not report visual symptoms such as vision loss or visual field defects.

In recent years, cases of optic disc edema accompanied by decreased visual function have been reported. Most of these cases were diagnosed as monocular nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) occurring at high altitude. For example, a 41-year-old pilot was reported to have developed NAION in the left eye, and another case involved a 33-year-old man who experienced NAION for 3 months following exposure to high altitude (17,953 feet above sea level). Yin A. Liu et al. reported five patients with high-altitude-associated NAION. The main clinical characteristics of NAION include painless loss of vision associated with optic disc swelling, leading to altitudinal visual field loss and subsequent chronic optic atrophy. A small cup-to-disc ratio or small optic discs (also referred to as congenitally anomalous discs or "discs at risk") is the strongest risk factor associated with NAION (over 95%). Other risk factors strongly associated with NAION include hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus, cardio- and cerebrovascular disease, and obstructive sleep apnoea.

### Optic neuropathy associated with the use of over-the-counter sexual enhancement supplements [^116tfPap]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Case report

A 42-year-old healthy man was evaluated initially elsewhere for acute right-sided headache followed by visual loss of the right eye with pain on eye movement. Best-corrected visual acuity was 20/400 in the right eye and 20/20 in the left eye, with a right relative afferent pupillary defect. The right eye had 30% red desaturation and an inferonasal visual field defect. Optic disc edema was not detected, and a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) without contrast was unremarkable. After 5 days of deteriorating vision, the patient was prescribed 40 mg prednisone daily.

The patient was then referred to our clinic for progressive visual loss and persistent pain with eye movement in the right eye. At initial presentation, 7 days after onset of symptoms, vision in the right eye was hand motion temporally with a relative afferent pupillary defect. The optic nerve had mild edema with blurring of the superior margin. Orbit MRI with contrast revealed enhancement of the right optic nerve and sheath (Figure 1A and B), as well as nonspecific periventricular, deep, and subcortical white matter lesions. The patient was started on intravenous methylprednisolone 1 g daily, with a plan to assess clinical response frequently, as the MRI optic nerve and sheath enhancement suggested an inflammatory component.

Repeat examination at 11 days after the onset of symptoms demonstrated narrowing of the visual field of the right eye to hand motion in a small temporal island and persistent right afferent pupillary defect. The right optic nerve head was diffusely edematous without hemorrhage (Figure 2A), and the left optic nerve head was normal with a 0.5 cup-to-disc ratio (Figure 2B). A systemic workup for inflammatory etiologies was unremarkable, including anti-aquaporin-4 antibody, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, angiotensin-converting enzyme, rapid plasma reagin, and fluorescent treponemal antibody, as well as Leber hereditary optic neuropathy genotyping, chest X-ray, and cerebral spinal fluid analysis. Due to lack of improvement in vision, intravenous methylprednisolone was discontinued after 8 days and the patient was started on oral prednisone 60 mg daily for 1 week, with a taper of 40 mg daily for 1 week, followed by 20 mg daily for 1 week.

### Pallid optic disc oedema in non-arteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy without a conventional'disc at risk' [^116amWz2]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Non-arteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy (NAION) is typically characterised by non-pallid optic disc oedema and a contralateral small optic nerve head. Typically, the optic cup is absent or small with a cup-to-disc ratio of less than 0.3 termed 'disc at risk'. While systemic and ocular risk factors are identified as risk factors of NAION, the exact pathogenesis of NAION is not fully understood. We report a case of NAION with pallid optic disc oedema and the absence of a disc at risk in a patient with multiple vascular risk factors, suggesting an underlying severe atherosclerotic pathology. This case highlights that NAION may present with atypical features with pallid optic disc oedema and absence of a disc at risk and highlights atherosclerosis as an associated underlying risk factor.

### Bilateral optic disc swelling; is a CT scan necessary? [^116QLsMs]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2005). Low credibility.

A 47 year old man sustained a head injury after tripping. He presented to the accident and emergency department next morning where head x ray revealed no fractures. However, the casualty doctor found bilateral blurred optic disc margins on ophthalmoscopy. Although his head injury was classed as non-serious, an urgent computed tomography scan was ordered and an ophthalmic opinion sought. After detailed retinal examination, the ophthalmologist made a diagnosis of bilateral optic nerve head drusen (ONHD), which was confirmed by a B-scan ultrasound. The patient was advised not to drive (due to constricted visual fields associated with ONHD) and to inform his siblings of his condition so they could also be assessed. In cases of apparent optic disc swellings, it is essential to distinguish between true and pseudo-papillo-oedema to avoid subjecting patients to unnecessary neuroimaging procedures and associated exposure to radiation.

Variables

Demographics, comorbidities, clinical manifestations, optic disc, perimetry, OCT findings, management, and outcomes were compared between unilateral MOGAD-ON and NAION. Crowded disc was defined by cup-to-disc ratio of < 0.3 in the unaffected eye or from prior evaluation of the affected eye if available. Tempo of vision loss was dichotomized at 48 hours. Eye pain and preceding headache were presumed to be absent if not documented in the chart, but the other missing data were treated as missing. Altitudinal visual field defect was determined from perimetry or, if not available, from patient-reported history of vision loss in the top or bottom half of the visual field in one eye.

Optic disc, perimetry, and OCT findings had to be obtained within 14 days of the onset of vision loss to be included in the analysis. Grading of optic disc edema was obtained from charts or derived from peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL) thickness as follows: mild, up to 150 μm; moderate, 150–224 μm; and severe, 225 μm or higher. Estimated pRNFL thickening was determined by the difference between the affected and unaffected eyes. Visual outcomes were collected at least 3 months after the onset of vision loss. A subgroup analysis was performed among patients with optic disc edema at presentation, which were the subset with a higher risk of diagnostic dilemma.

All OCTs were performed using Cirrus HD-OCT (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, CA). Patients with high refractive error (± 6 diopters) and images with artifact, segmentation errors, or signal strength < 6 were excluded to adhere to the APOSTEL 2.0 recommendations and OSCAR-IB consensus criteria for quality assessment of OCT images. The pRNFL thickness measurements were obtained using the optic disc cube 200 × 200 Cirrus protocol that covered the 6 × 6 mm² area centered on the optic disc. The macular cube 512 × 128 Cirrus protocol centered on the fovea was used for the ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (GCIP) segmentation and measurements.

### Acute unilateral vision loss in a female adolescent due to ocular bartonellosis [^116pwsZV]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Acute worsening of visual acuity with optic disc edema is commonly assumed to be due to idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Bartonella henselae is an unusual cause to abrupt vision loss that is associated with optic disc edema and exudative macular stars seen on examination. It is an important cause to be aware of because it responds very well to antibiotic treatment. We present a case of a female adolescent with unilateral vision loss cause by cat-scratch neuroretinitis.

### Mechanisms of visual loss in papilledema [^115S6HWp]. Neurosurgical Focus (2007). Low credibility.

The term "papilledema" indicates swelling of the optic discs secondary to increased intracranial pressure. Papilledema can be caused by an intracranial mass lesion or by other factors. Visual symptoms frequently accompany papilledema, which can lead to permanent visual loss if left untreated. Starting with an illustrative case, the authors review the pathophysiology of the visual signs and symptoms of papilledema. They also briefly review potential treatment options, focusing on the role of the neurosurgeon in the treatment of patients with papilledema.

### Sildenafil-associated nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy [^115cJnkH]. Ophthalmology (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

To describe the clinical features of five patients who developed nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) after ingestion of sildenafil citrate (Viagra; Pfizer Pharmaceuticals, New York, NY).

Design

Retrospective observational case series.

Participants

Five patients with NAION who reported the use of sildenafil citrate before the onset of ocular symptoms.

Main Outcome Measures

The symptoms presented, history, ophthalmic examination, and visual field examination of each patient.

Results

Nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy developed in one eye within minutes to hours after ingestion of sildenafil. Four of the five patients had no vascular risk factors for ischemic optic neuropathy. The patients all developed unilateral blurry vision, altitudinal visual field defects, and optic disc edema. Each of the patients was noted to have a small cup-to-disc ratio in the unaffected optic nerve.

Conclusions

Sildenafil citrate may be associated with NAION. A small cup-to-disc ratio may be a risk factor for development of NAION in association with the use of sildenafil.

MOGAD-ON With Disc Edema at Onset

Among 37 unilateral MOGAD-ON patients with disc edema at onset, the discriminating features from NAION were similar to the total MOGAD-ON cohort (Table 1). Dyslipidemia, obstructive sleep apnea, and crowded disc were significantly less common in MOGAD-ON compared with NAION. Nineteen (51%) MOGAD-ON had progression beyond 48 hours, and 89% had eye pain that increased with eye movement (Table 2). The median pRNFL thickness in MOGAD-ON with disc edema at onset was 145.5 (IQR 101–215) μm, 48.5 (IQR 19–118) μm thicker than the fellow unaffected eye, both of which were still significantly lower than seen in the patients with NAION (pRNFL thickness 201 [IQR 155–240], p = 0.008; thickening 102 [IQR 70–140]; p = 0.003).

The strong predictors for MOGAD-ON based on multivariate analysis (eye pain, absence of crowded optic disc, and absence of altitudinal visual field defect) were applied to the subgroup of patients with optic disc edema individually and in combination to determine their sensitivity and specificity in differentiating MOGAD-ON from NAION (Table 3). Combining multiple predictors improved the specificity for MOGAD-ON diagnosis in acute optic neuropathy patients with optic disc edema to over 99.9%. The positive likelihood ratio for MOGAD-ON was also increased from 3-fold for each individual predictor to 414-fold when all the 3 predictors were present, highlighting the importance of these clinical clues.

Introduction

Optic nerve ischemic neuropathy is a significant cause of irreversible vision loss, particularly affecting individuals over 50 years of age. Patients typically present with a sudden, painless decline in visual acuity and visual field defects. This condition encompasses a spectrum of disorders with varied etiologies, clinical presentations, and management approaches, making a unified categorization challenging.

Optic nerve involvement in ischemic neuropathy can be broadly classified by anatomical location: anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION), affecting the optic disc, and posterior ischemic optic neuropathy (PION), affecting the retrolaminar region. AION is further subdivided into arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AAION) and non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION). NAION is the most common form of acute optic neuropathy in older adults, characterized by sudden, unilateral vision loss, typically presenting with a hyperemic optic disc edema. In contrast, AAION, often associated with giant cell arteritis, typically presents with a pallid disc swelling and affects an older demographic. Differential diagnosis between AION and optic neuritis, and distinguishing between AAION and NAION are critical due to differing underlying etiologies and management strategies. While AAION involves arterial occlusion, NAION is often attributed to a combination of predisposing factors (like a crowded optic disc) and precipitating events (such as hypotension) in the context of underlying vascular risk factors.

### Bilateral optic nerve sheath enhancement from giant cell arteritis [^116Hz17T]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2003). Low credibility.

An 83-year-old man presented with acute bilateral visual loss to no light perception (NLP) OD and 20/50 OS. His fundus examination showed moderate bilateral pallid disc edema. A sedimentation rate was 60 mm/h. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits with gadolinium revealed marked bilateral enhancement of the optic nerve sheaths and adjacent orbital fat. He underwent biopsies of the optic sheath OD and bilateral temporal arteries. Histopathology of the optic nerve sheath area revealed fibroadipose tissue containing numerous arteries with intimal thickening, and mild mural inflammation consisting predominantly of lymphocyte with occasional giant cells. The bilateral temporal artery biopsies revealed focal disruption of the elastic lamina with rare giant cells. His vision had since stabilized on IV methypdnisolone therapy. The biopsies of the nerve sheath suggest that the radiologic finding of optic nerve sheath enhancement in giant cell arteritis is caused by tbe same pathophysiology, and therefore may be a manifestation of this systemic disease.

DISC EDEMA OR PSEUDOEDEMA?

Clinical history and fundoscopic examination cannot reliably distinguish disc edema from pseudoedema

In most cases of optic nerve head elevation, clinical history and optic nerve examination are not sufficient to make the correct diagnosis. There are many overlapping clinical characteristics, and patients can present with normal vision or relatively nonspecific visual disturbances (Table 1). Patients with ODD or papilledema commonly have normal central vision, whereas those with optic disc edema because of optic neuritis or AION typically have symptomatic vision loss.

On funduscopic examination, most causes of optic nerve head elevation look similar – the optic disc is full and elevated, and there is blurred disc margin and small cup-to-disc (C/D) ratio (Table 2). There may be venous congestion and dilation, peripapillary arteriolar irregularity or narrowing, and signs of ischemia. These are important signs of vascular compromise that should heighten awareness for risk of sudden vision loss.

### Ocular Lyme borreliosis as a rare presentation of unilateral vision loss [^115Eu74K]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Ocular Lyme borreliosis is a rare manifestation of Lyme disease. We describe a case of an 80-year-old woman who presented with a 1-month history of unilateral painless central vision loss. Based on a temporal artery biopsy, she was initially diagnosed with giant cell arteritis and treated with a 3-day course of high-dose intravenous steroids. A more detailed history uncovered multiple previous treatments for Lyme disease and residence in an endemic Lyme area. The patient was subsequently diagnosed with ocular Lyme borreliosis and treated with intravenous antibiotics. After 5weeks of treatment, unilateral vision loss did not progress and optic disc oedema resolved.

### Treatment strategies for inherited optic neuropathies: past, present and future [^113r23FR]. Eye (2014). Low credibility.

Clinical features

Fundal abnormalities such as peripapillary telangiectatic vessels and transient retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) oedema can be observed in some asymptomatic LHON carriers. On more detailed psychophysical testing, some unaffected LHON carriers also show subclinical optic nerve impairment with reduced colour vision and contrast sensitivity, and subnormal responses on multifocal electroretinography and visual evoked potentials. Disease conversion in LHON is characterised by acute or subacute, painless, central visual loss in one eye, followed weeks to months later by the fellow eye. The median inter-eye delay is 6–8 weeks, and the second eye is invariably affected within 1 year of disease onset. Bilateral simultaneous onset occurs in a proportion of patients (∼25%) with the caveat that some individuals are probably unaware that visual loss had been ongoing unnoticed in one eye before the second eye being involved. Although there are rare case reports of unilateral optic nerve involvement in LHON, it is important to exclude other underlying pathological causes in these highly atypical presentations. The peak age of onset is in the second and third decades of life, and it is unusual for LHON carriers to experience visual loss beyond the age of 50 years. Visual acuity worse than 6/60 is the norm at the nadir, and there is an associated dense central or centrocecal scotoma with profound dyschromatopsia. Interestingly, the pupillary light reflexes are relatively preserved in LHON due to the sparing of a special class of melanopsin-containing RGCs that seem more resistant to mitochondrial dysfunction.

A careful dilated fundus examination can be particularly informative in the acute stage of LHON as patients classically exhibit a number of distinct abnormalities, namely, optic disc hyperaemia, peripapillary telangiectatic vessels, vascular tortuosity, and swelling of the retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) secondary to axoplasmic stasis (Figure 2a). It is important to stress that the posterior pole can look entirely normal in a proportion (20–40%) of affected LHON carriers and the diagnosis may be delayed until optic disc pallor becomes apparent at around 6 weeks. This group of patients are frequently labelled as having functional visual loss, at least initially. In addition to pallor of the neuroretinal rim, non-glaucomatous cupping of the optic disc is also a recognised pathological feature of longstanding LHON cases, reflecting the progressive loss of RGCs that occurs in the chronic phase of the disease process.

### Etiology of papilledema in patients in the eye clinic setting [^1122UTmj]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

The study of health conditions associated with papilledema will augment the clinical judgment of eye care professionals treating patients with optic disc edema in determining the urgency of additional evaluation and counseling patients accordingly.

Objectives

To determine the incidence, demographic characteristics, and etiologies of papilledema based on a unique records-linkage research platform; and to describe the demographic and clinical differences between patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) and other causes of papilledema.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Retrospective population-based cross-sectional study of patients treated for papilledema at outpatient eye clinics in Olmsted County, Minnesota, using the Rochester Epidemiology Project. Data were collected from January 1990 to December 2014 and analyzed from September 2018 to April 2019.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Etiologies of papilledema, body mass index, incidence of headache, or localizing neurologic signs.

Results

Eighty-six patients were diagnosed with papilledema during the 24-year period, providing an age- and sex-adjusted incidence of 2.5 individuals per 100 000 per year; 68 patients (79%) were women, 73 (85%) were white patients, and the median (range) age was 27.7 (6.2–64.2) years. Nineteen patients (22%) presented with a previously diagnosed attributable cause (eg, trauma or intracranial tumor). Among patients presenting with papilledema without a previously diagnosed attributable cause, 58 patients (87%) had IIH, and 9 patients (13%) were found to have a secondary cause of raised intracranial pressure, such as intracranial tumor, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, or granulomatous meningitis. Patients with IIH had a higher median (range) body mass index (37.5 [20.4–55.7] vs 27.4 [16.6–40.1]; p = 0.003) and headache prevalence (54 of 58 patients [93%] vs 6 of 9 patients [67%]; p = 0.004) than patients with other causes of papilledema. Of 9 patients with papilledema but no IIH, 2 (22%) had localizing neurologic signs, such as gait abnormalities, hearing loss, focal weakness or numbness, visual field defects, or aphasia. Among 42 patients with demographic characteristics typically associated with IIH (female sex, with obesity, aged 15 to 45 years, and absent localizing neurologic signs or symptoms), 40 (95%) had papilledema that was associated with IIH. Conversely, among the 19 patients without these demographic characteristics, 7 (37%) had an alternative cause.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this study, most patients who presented to the eye clinic with papilledema without a previously known cause were found to have IIH. These patients were more likely to present with headaches and had statistically higher body mass index. Clinicians should take these findings into account when determining the pretest probability of a patient having IIH or an alternative cause of papilledema.

Optic nerve disorders

Immune-related optic neuritis

Common: Patients developing optic neuritis (ON) can present with either unilateral or bilateral findings and symptoms, which generally include an acute loss of vision that is commonly associated with pain with eye movements. Signs of optic neuropathy should be present (diminished visual acuity and color vision, an afferent pupillary defect in unilateral disease, and possibly optic disc abnormalities such as edema and/or pallor). It is recommended to obtain visual field (VF) tests early on to aid with diagnosis and serve as a baseline for comparison post-treatment (online supplemental table 2).

MRI of the brain and orbits with and without contrast is required for diagnosis. T1 post-contrast fat-suppressed sequences and T2/short tau inversion recovery sequences are more sensitive for the detection of ON-related signal changes. An MRI brain assists in detecting a more disseminated CNS process.

### Updates on ophthalmic imaging features of optic disc drusen, papilledema, and optic disc edema [^111tCKNU]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Optic nerve head elevation can be associated with vision loss. This review provides an update regarding key features of optic disc drusen (ODD) compared with papilledema from increased intracranial pressure and optic disc edema from other causes.

Recent Findings

Clinical history and funduscopic examination are not sufficient to correctly diagnose different causes of optic nerve head elevation. Multimodal ophthalmic imaging is noninvasive and should be used as first-line diagnostic testing to distinguish optic disc edema or papilledema from pseudoedema. Advanced ophthalmic imaging, including enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography (EDI-OCT) and autofluorescence imaging, can visualize ODD at high resolution and determine whether there is optic disc edema. OCT angiography does not require contrast and can rapidly visualize papillary, peripapillary, and macular microvasculature and identify important vascular biomarker of ischemia and, potentially, visual prognosis.

Summary

Multimodal ophthalmic imaging can help in the diagnosis of ODD and optic disc edema and identify patients at high risk of vision loss and neurological issues in order to ensure appropriate diagnosis and treatment.

### Proning related bilateral anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy in a patient with COVID-19 related acute respiratory distress syndrome [^1115tZjz]. BMC Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Non-arteritic ischaemic optic neuropathy (NAION) is a rare but harmful complication of prone positioning. Prone mechanical ventilation is a therapeutic strategy which has been used extensively during the COVID-19 pandemic to treat acutely hypoxemic patients with COVID-19 related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Though a small number of cases of unilateral NAION have been reported in patients testing positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, we describe what is to our knowledge, the first reported case of bilateral NAION occurring in a patient proned extensively for the treatment of COVID-19 related ARDS. We consider the potential aetiological factors leading to NAION after prone mechanical ventilation in patients with COVID-19 and suggest strategies to protect against its development.

Case Presentation

We report a case of severe, irreversible, visual impairment secondary to bilateral anterior ION in a fifty-five-year-old male who underwent eight episodes of prone mechanical ventilation to treat COVID-19 related ARDS. Once weaned from his sedation he reported bilateral painless vision loss, and bedside ophthalmological assessment identified a reduced visual acuity of 3/30 unaided in the left eye and counting fingers in the right. Dilated indirect ophthalmoscopy revealed inferotemporal optic disc oedema with splinter haemorrhages in the right eye and mild disc oedema, temporal pallor, and nerve fibre layer haemorrhages inferiorly in the left eye. Humphrey visual field 24–2 testing confirmed a severely constricted visual field with macular sparing on the right and depressed inferonasal vision with preserved peripheral vision on the left eye. OCT disc imaging shortly after diagnosis revealed bilateral disc swelling and flame haemorrhages in the right eye.

Conclusions

NAION is a devastating, but preventable complication of prone positioning, which may pose significant risk of vision loss in patients with COVID-19 related ARDS.

### Acute visual loss and optic disc edema followed by optic atrophy in two cases with deeply buried optic disc drusen: a mimicker of atypical optic neuritis [^114bdoQZ]. BMC Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Sudden visual loss and optic disc edema caused by optic neuritis (ON) is usually followed by significant visual recovery. However, little or no recovery occurs when the loss is caused by atypical ON, especially in patients with neuromyelitis optica (NMO). Optic disc drusen (ODD) is a cause of pseudo optic disc edema and may be a predisposing factor for non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), thereby mimicking atypical ON. In such cases, if globular concretions are seen protruding from the disc substance, ODD may be suspected. The purpose of this paper is to describe two patients with acute visual loss followed by optic disc atrophy initially labeled as atypical ON. Though not suspected on clinical examination, optical coherence tomography (OCT) revealed deeply buried ODD as a predisposing factor for NAION.

Case Presentations

Case 1: A 48-year-old woman had bilateral sequential visual loss associated with optic disc edema. Despite treatment, vision did not improve and severe disc pallor ensued. Atypical ON was suspected. Eventually, she was started on immunosuppressant therapy based on a tentative diagnosis of NMO-spectrum disorder. On examination 5 years later, only severe optic disc pallor was observed, but OCT radial B-scans showed ovoid hyporeflective areas in the retrolaminar region of both eyes, compatible with ODD; this led to a diagnosis of NAION and deeply buried ODD. Case 2. A 35-year-old woman with suspicion of ON in the left eye and a history of previous atypical ON in the right eye was referred for neuro-ophthalmic examination which revealed diffuse optic disc pallor and a dense arcuate visual field defect in the right eye. OCT B-scans passing through the disc showed large ovoid areas of reduced reflectivity in the retrolaminar region of the optic disc in the right eye. These findings helped confirm the diagnosis of NAION in one eye, with deeply buried ODD as predisposing factor.

Conclusions

Deeply buried ODD may be associated with NAION causing irreversible visual loss and optic disc pallor, a condition easily mistaken for atypical ON. Awareness of such occurrence is important to avoid unnecessary testing and minimize the risk of mismanagement.

### Optic nerve edema and retrobulbar optic neuritis cases associated with jamestown canyon virus in Wisconsin and Michigan [^114AFVgc]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2025). Medium credibility.

Three adult patients with unilateral optic neuropathy, seropositive for Jamestown Canyon virus (JCV) IgM and acute infection, experienced acute unilateral vision loss. Two cases had swollen optic nerves with vision loss in a pattern suggestive of papillitis, whereas the third had retrobulbar optic neuritis. All presented with vision loss rather than typical meningoencephalitis symptoms (e.g., nuchal rigidity, photophobia, and headache). Case 1 had 20/20 vision (right/left), relative afferent pupillary defect (left), and marked optic disc edema. Perimetry revealed an increased blind spot. Final visual acuity was bilaterally 20/20. Case 2 had 20/100 (right) and 20/20 (left) vision. Within 15 days, the right eye had hand-motion vision. The optic nerves were flat. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits revealed that the right optic nerve had intrinsic T2 signal increase in the distal intraorbital segment and intracanalicular nerve and appeared slightly swollen. Findings were consistent with mild or resolving right optic neuritis. The cerebrospinal fluid JCV IgM antibody reflex tests were presumptive JCV. Case 3 presented with headache and left retrobulbar eye pain. Vision was 20/15 (right) and 20/30 (left). The left optic nerve was severely edematous. Magnetic resonance imaging of orbit revealed mild bulging and enhancement of the left optic nerve. The Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene and the CDC found that the JCV IgM antibody was elevated and positive in all three patients. Workup for alternative etiologies of papillitis and optic neuritis were negative. It is, therefore, possible that JCV may have been the cause of optic neuropathies.

### Acute optic neuropathy in older adults: differentiating between MOGAD optic neuritis and nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy [^115Xx7RJ]. Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study highlights key differences in the presentation of MOGAD-ON and NAION and also demonstrates overlap that could challenge this distinction. Diagnostic uncertainty between unilateral MOGAD-ON and NAION in older adults occurred in around one-third of patients with either diagnosis. Vascular comorbidities were common in patients 45 years or older with both diseases. However, vision loss in MOGAD-ON often worsened beyond 48 hours after onset of vision changes and was preceded by headache and eye pain that increased with eye movement. Disc edema and pRNFL thickening were less pronounced in unilateral MOGAD-ON compared with NAION. Although MOGAD-ON had more severe vision loss at nadir, the visual outcomes after 3 months were better. False-positive serum MOG-IgG was observed in 8% of patients with NAION.

NAION and optic neuritis are clinical diagnoses. However, the discovery of the MOG and aquaporin-4 antibodies has redefined optic neuritis as a phenotype that encompasses different diseases with distinct pathophysiology and prognosis. Previous studies evaluating differentiating features of optic neuritis and NAION included patients solely by clinical criteria, which also included an upper age limit of 46 for optic neuritis and a lower age limit of 50 in NAION. By design, patients with equivocal clinical characteristics were excluded, creating a spectrum bias. The MOG antibody biomarker allows us to specifically study MOGAD-ON, which commonly causes disc edema that can mimic NAION but was only present in 1.7% of the ONTT participants.

To capture cases that might pose the largest diagnostic dilemma, we used age 45 years as the threshold. Notably, this age is lower than the inclusion criteria for patients with NAION in the Ischemic Optic Neuropathy Decompression Trial (IONDT), but Preechawat et al.demonstrated that patients younger than 50 years shared similar risk factors for NAION as older patients. The higher rates of diabetes and hypertension in our cohort reflect the rising prevalence worldwide. Although diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and obesity constitute metabolic syndrome and are associated with increased risk for NAION, there are also common in MOGAD-ON and thus are not good differentiators in our study.

### Acute optic neuropathy in older adults: differentiating between MOGAD optic neuritis and nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy [^114yQqUZ]. Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Particularly in the setting of low positive serum MOG-IgG (titer < 1:100), we should raise caution for misdiagnosis as MOGAD-ON. The 2023 MOGAD diagnostic criteria require supportive clinical features (optic disc edema or bilateral simultaneous involvement) or MRI findings (optic nerve enhancement involving more than 50% of the nerve length or perineural enhancement) to establish MOGAD-ON diagnosis in the setting of low or unknown MOG-IgG titer. This study adds that medical history, examination, and OCT findings may also help differentiate between the 2 entities and highlights cases that would benefit from an early orbital and brain MRI and MOG-IgG testing.

The major limitation of this study was its retrospective design; therefore, some data were not consistently available. Because NAION has a racial preponderance in White patientsand most patients with NAION were retrieved from Mayo Clinic, there was an imbalance of racial distribution between MOGAD-ON and NAION. Furthermore, NAION remains a clinical diagnosis, and we cannot completely exclude atypical optic neuritis or MOGAD-ON in some patients in the NAION cohort. Over 90% of patients with NAION in our cohort were not tested for MOG-IgG. However, restricting NAION cases to those who received MOG-IgG testing would have created a bias toward atypical NAION cases. A positive MOG-IgG test is also not diagnostic by itself since it also requires clinical and radiologic features of optic neuritis to fulfill the 2023 diagnostic criteria for MOGAD. In addition, discriminating features between MOGAD-ON and NAION could be identified even with potential misclassification bias in the NAION group which should have made the 2 groups more similar. The observed differences despite the bias increased our confidence in the strength of these predictors.

Acute unilateral optic neuropathy with disc edema in patients 45 years or older can be caused by either MOGAD-ON or NAION. While there is overlap in age group and vascular risk factors, a detailed history (eye pain, tempo, pattern, and severity of vision loss), ophthalmic findings (crowded disc and the degree of pRNFL thickening on OCT), and visual outcomes can help determine cases that would benefit from additional work-up and prevent indiscriminate serum MOG-IgG testing.

### Optic disc oedema: a diagnostic dilemma [^114AauR3]. BMJ Case Reports (2011). Medium credibility.

The authors describe a patient who presented with bilateral disc oedema and left eye visual loss. The patient was evaluated for intracranial space occupying lesion, however, a CT and cerebrospinal tap was normal. No definitive diagnosis could be established and patient developed left eye optic atrophy which was thought to be post papilloedema atrophy. Six months later, the patient had similar visual loss in right eye and he was diagnosed as anterior ischemic optic atrophy (AION) by the ophthalmologist. The inferior altitudinal visual field loss, delayed visual evoked response and clinical picture supported the diagnosis. The patient was diagnosed with hypertension and type 2 diabetes and managed accordingly. All the symptoms, clinical findings, investigations supported the diagnosis of AION which occurred in left eye followed by right eye 6 months later. Appropriate treatment was started and patient regained vision in right eye.

Tuberculous spondylitis

The spine is the most common bony TB involvement site, with the lower thoracic and upper lumbar vertebrae being most frequently affected. Vertebral body involvement adjacent to the disc, subligamentous involvement, and spread to the superior or inferior vertebrae without any effect on the vertebral disc are observed. MRI is helpful in early-stage diagnosis, with typical radiological findings showing hypointensity on T1-weighted images, hyperintensity on T2-weighted images, and post-contrast irregular, patchy enhancement in the anterior part of the vertebra corpus end platelets indicating bone marrow edema (Fig. 44). Subligamentous spread, a paraspinal localization, a smoothly circumscribed abscess containing a small amount of edema around three or more vertebrae (cold abscess), less bone destruction despite significant paraspinal involvement, and relative preservation of the intervertebral disc are all significant indications of tuberculous spondylodiscitis (Figs. 45, 46). In untreated cases, vertebral collapse and anterior angulation can cause kyphosis, the Gibbus deformity.

### Optic disc edema with decreased visual function after high-altitude exposure [^113qA69m]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

A high incidence of clinical optic disc edema has been observed at high altitudes; however, most patients experience complete regression upon returning to lowlands and do not report visual symptoms such as vision loss or visual field defects. Here, we report six patients with optic disc edema and significantly decreased visual function after high-altitude exposure.

Methods

Clinical characteristics, intracranial pressure, 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure, and polysomnography data were retrospectively collected from patients presenting with optic disc edema and decreased visual function after high-altitude exposure on the Tibetan plateau between October 2020 and September 2023 at the neuro-ophthalmology department of the People's Liberation Army General Hospital in China.

Results

Eleven eyes of six patients (five males and one female) were included, with a mean age of 47.3 ± 11.76 years (range 28–63). Simultaneous bilateral eye involvement was present in five of the six patients. All cases presented with diffuse disc edema at onset, which gradually resolved within 8 weeks. There was a definite time lag, ranging from 7 days to 1 month, between arrival at high altitude and symptom onset. All patients had normal intracranial pressure. Mean visual acuity was worst (20/50) at 2 weeks, and the best mean visual acuity was 20/30 at 6 months. Visual field defects were observed in all patients at the early stage of the disease, with some residual defects remaining. One patient had a small cup-to-disc ratio in the contralateral eye, while the other five could not be assessed due to bilateral optic disc edema. One patient had hypertension and severe sleep apnea; one had hypercholesterolemia and hypertension; and one had hypercholesterolemia alone.

Conclusion

Optic disc edema with decreased visual function and visual field defects can occur after high-altitude exposure.

### Comparison of early-and late-onset NMOSD-related optic neuritis in Thai patients: clinical characteristics and long-term visual outcomes [^112MNEVv]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical Characteristics at ON Onset

At ON onset, bilateral simultaneous ON was observed in two patients in the EO-NMOSD-ON group, compared with none in the LO-NMOSD-ON group. In contrast, a previous retrospective study reported that 11 of 59 patients with LO-NMOSD-ON (18.6%) experienced bilateral simultaneous ON. The difference in results between studies is presumably because our investigation included a smaller number of patients with LO-NMOSD-ON. Furthermore, pain is one of the most frequent symptoms at ON onset; this was observed in approximately three-fifths of both LO-NMOSD-ON–affected eyes and EO-NMOSD-ON–affected eyes. These rates were fairly similar to the findings in a previous study.

In our study, LO-NMOSD-ON–affected eyes had significantly worse nadir VA at ON onset, compared with EO-NMOSD-ON–affected eyes. Moreover, all LO-NMOSD-ON–affected eyes demonstrated a nadir VA at ON onset of worse than or equal to 1.0 logMAR, compared with 62.5% of EO-NMOSD-ON–affected eyes. These results were consistent with the findings in previous studies, whereby patients with LO-NMOSD had worse Expanded Disability Status Scale scores after first attack, relative to patients with EO-NMOSD. Worse nadir VA at ON onset in LO-NMOSD-ON–affected eyes might be the result of a negative relationship between retinal nerve fiber layer thickness and age. Older patients tend to have thinner retinal nerve fiber layer thickness. ON is one of the core demyelinating events in NMOSD; when this occurs, affected eyes in older patients tend to have more severe destruction of the retinal nerve fiber layer. This destruction presumably causes worse nadir VA at ON onset in LO-NMOSD-ON–affected eyes.

We observed that optic disc edema tended to occur more in EO-NMOSD-ON–affected eyes than in LO-NMOSD-ON–affected eyes, although this difference was not statistically significant. As noted above, older patients tend to have thinner retinal nerve fiber layer thickness, which might have interfered with clinical detection of optic disc edema. Importantly, we are unaware of studies concerning this manifestation, for which the results could be compared with our current findings.

### The swollen optic nerve: an approach to diagnosis and management [^112xaNFv]. Practical Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

The differential diagnosis of swollen optic nerves differs according to whether the swelling is unilateral or bilateral, or whether visual function is normal or affected. Patients with a unilaterally swollen optic nerve and normal visual function most likely have optic nerve head drusen. Patients with abnormal visual function most likely have demyelinating optic neuritis or non-arteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy. Patients with bilaterally swollen optic nerve heads and normal visual function most likely have papilloedema, and require neuroimaging followed by lumbar puncture. However, if their visual function is affected, the most likely causes are bilateral demyelinating optic neuritis, neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder and anti-myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein optic neuritis: these patients require investigating with contrast-enhanced MRI of the orbits.

### A study of the causes of bilateral optic disc swelling in Japanese patients [^114W2CnC]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Methods

Using Kitasato University's Department of Neuro-Ophthalmology medical records and fundus photographs of the period December 1977 through November 2010, we retrospectively identified 121 outpatients who had been initially confirmed with bilateral disc swelling. We excluded patients without fundus photographic confirmation of disc swelling. This study population consisted of 54 males and 67 females with an average age of 38.2 years (range 2–76 years). We defined terms as follows: "disc swelling" was the collective term used to describe disc swelling or protrusion; "papillitis" denoted optic neuritis with inflammatory findings on the optic disc such as swelling/redness or dilatation of the retinal vessels; and "papilledema" indicated bilateral disc swelling with elevated intracranial pressure. The final diagnosis was judged by ophthalmologic examinations (including light reflex of the pupil, visual acuity, visual field, critical flicker frequency, and fundus angiography) and intracranial examinations by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetic resonance venography (MRV), or computed tomography (CT), and consultation with the Kitasato University Department of Neurology or Department of Neurosurgery.

### Hip pain in adults: evaluation and differential diagnosis… [^112yXuro]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

24 It can be caused by a cam deformity, which is bony overgrowth of the femoral head and neck, a pincer deformity of the acetabulum, or both. Femoroacetabular impingement often has a gradual onset without a specific injury. OSTEOARTHRITIS In older adults, osteoarthritis of the femoroacetabular joint is the most common cause of anterior hip pain. 3 It can lead to significant morbidity and decrease in physical activity. Osteoarthritis of the hip typically has a gradual onset, but some patients recall a specific injury or fall. Patients with this condition may have pain with sitting and ambulating for long periods and may have an antalgic gait. Physical examination maneuvers such as flexion and internal and external rotation may reproduce pain, and range of motion may be decreased. 4, 6.

Standing anteroposterior radiography of the pelvis is the radiologic test of choice and will show joint space narrowing and osteophyte formation. However, presence of these findings does not always correlate with symptom severity. 7, 13, 29 Ultrasound-guided anesthetic injection of the hip joint may help differentiate an intra-articular cause of pain from other causes, and corticosteroid injection may be therapeutic for intra-articular pain.
30. PIRIFORMIS AND DEEP GLUTEAL SYNDROME Piriformis syndrome is thought to be a result of the piriformis muscle entrapping the sciatic nerve, causing hip and buttock pain and sciatica. Piriformis syndrome is a subset of deep gluteal syndrome, which includes entrapment of the sciatic nerve and/or pudendal nerve by the piriformis muscle, gemelliobturator internus, or proximal hamstrings.

18 Patients with deep gluteal syndrome have deep buttock pain that is aggravated by sitting and sciatica symptoms. The seated piriformis stretch test may reproduce this pain. 18 Although conservative treatments are often helpful, MRI may be needed to identify pathology in the deep gluteal muscles or sciatic and pudendal nerves. Additionally, electrodiagnostic nerve testing can help localize the area of nerve entrapment. 18.

### Acute visual loss and optic disc edema followed by optic atrophy in two cases with deeply buried optic disc drusen: a mimicker of atypical optic neuritis [^114dCSPi]. BMC Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

The pathogenesis of NAION in eyes with ODD in not completely understood but is thought to involve a decrease in the perfusion pressure at the optic nerve head that leads to infarction. Both NAION and ODD usually occurs in eyes with absent or small cup-disc ratio and crowded optic appearance. While the occurrence of both conditions might be coincidental it is most likely that ODD contributes for the development of NAION by promoting further crowding the disk contributing to secondary vascular compromise. Purvin et al. reviewed the clinical findings in 20 patients (24 affected eyes) that experienced NAION associated with ODD and found many similarities with those of NAION in eyes unassociated with drusen. However, patients with ODD were younger, fared a more favorable visual outcome and were more likely to report preceding episodes of transient visual obscuration. Some of these characteristics are present in our cases; case 2 had visual loss at age 25 and VA was 20/25 or better in the three affected eyes. As for the diagnosis of ODD, in 7 eyes it was established on fundus examination and in the others it was established on ultrasonography or computed tomography after the clinical suspicion because of disc appearance had a bumpy surface, scalloped margins or deep peripapillary hemorrhage.

### A case of paraneoplastic optic neuropathy and outer retinitis positive for autoantibodies against collapsin response mediator protein-5, recoverin, and α-enolase [^112rW67d]. BMC Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

Bilateral neuroretinitis with unilateral focal outer retinitis developed in a cancer patient positive for autoantibodies against recoverin, CRMP-5, and α-enolase. The ocular manifestations depended largely on comorbid cancer activity, suggesting the possible involvement of paraneoplastic mechanisms in the ocular disorder.

Neuroretinitis is an inflammatory disorder characterized by optic disc edema and the surrounding exudation despite with or without RAPD. In the differential diagnosis, papilledema and optic disc tumors were eliminated owing to the lack of abnormal brain or orbital MRI findings. Hypertensive retinopathy was also denied based on the absence of systemic hypertension. Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy was differentiated based on negative RAPD and the presence of anterior vitreous cells and retinal vasculitis. Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease was excluded because the patient had no extraocular symptoms of the disease and indocyanine green angiography showed no choroidal inflammation, such as multiple hypofluorescent spots that appear during the middle phase. Infectious neuroretinitis was denied because of the negative serological screening results including Bartonella henselae.

The pathogenesis of neuroretinitis is generally regarded as vasculitis at the optic disc. In this patient, a possible cause of optic disc swelling was thought to be vasculitis rather than neuritis because of several findings such as negative RAPD, normal P100 latency in VEP, and blind spot enlargement in perimetry. Anti-CRMP-5 antibody-positive PON presents optic neuritis or neuroretinitis characterized by optic disc swelling, the leakages of the optic disc and retinal vessels on FA, and anterior vitreous cells. Since the CRMP-5 protein localizes at oligodendrocytes within the myelin sheath of the optic nerve, bilateral neuroretinitis in this patient is thought to result from inflammation at the vicinity of the optic nerve caused by CRMP-5-related autoimmunity.

The present case also involved unilateral focal outer retinal inflammation with suspected fibrin formation at the fovea, which quickly responded to systemic corticosteroid therapy and completely resolved with the remaining loss of the IS/OS line. To our knowledge, no previous reports have shown such findings in patients with anti-CRMP-5 antibody-positive PON. Reasonably, autoantibodies other than anti-CRMP-5 antibody were likely to play a role in the pathogenesis of the outer retinal inflammation.

### Ultrasound assessment of optic disc edema in patients with headache [^115m3PYn]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Point-of-care ocular ultrasonography is emerging as a powerful tool to evaluate emergency department (ED) patients at risk for ophthalmologic and intracranial pathology. We present cases of 3 patients in whom optic disc swelling was identified using ocular ultrasound. Causes for optic disc swelling in our patients included idiopathic intracranial hypertension, secondary syphilis, and malignant hypertension with associated hypertensive retinopathy. Because direct visualization of the optic disc may be challenging in an ED setting, ultrasound examination of the optic disc may represent an important adjunct to fundoscopy when assessing patients with headache or visual complaints.

a RAPD expected if unilateral symptoms.

This table is provided for illustration and is not exhaustive. Less typical presentations may not follow this simplified categorisation.

There are numerous causes of unilateral or bilateral optic disc swelling. In anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy (AION), onset is usually abrupt, painless and unilateral. Non-arteritic AION most typically presents in patients over 50 years of age, with altitudinal hemifield loss first noticed upon waking, and the unaffected side has a 'disc at risk', crowded configuration. In arteritic AION, patients may have symptoms of giant cell arteritis, reduced temporal artery pulses, and elevated CRP, ESR and/or platelets. Relatively swift, painless vision loss in a young man, with asymmetric but bilateral disc swelling (then atrophy) may be Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy. In uveitis, thickening of the retinal nerve fibre layer may be noted on OCT imaging, without relative afferent pupil defect. Diabetic patients with poor glycaemic control develop asymptomatic 'diabetic papillopathy', usually with good visual function. Malignant hypertension usually causes bilateral disc swelling and subsequent partial optic atrophy, sometimes without other signs of hypertensive retinopathy. Elevated intracranial pressure, typically associated with bilateral disc swelling, often presents with an enlarged blind spot and nasal-step on visual perimetry but typically lacks red desaturation or central field loss. There are many causes of elevated intracranial pressure, but those with abrupt onset, such as cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, may be more likely to be misdiagnosed as bilateral ON. Errors in pRNFL scan centring or segmentation can mistakenly suggest swelling, as acknowledged in validated quality control criteria (OSCAR-IB). Apparent swelling and elevation of the optic disc without significant pRNFL thickening can be observed in cases of peripapillary hyperreflective ovoid mass-like structure (PHOMS), in patients with chronic raised intracranial pressure, optic disc drusen, or anatomical optic disc crowding.

### Atypical anterior optic neuropathy caused by toxoplasmosis [^114Lwj9A]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

To report atypical anterior optic neuropathy due to toxoplasmosis.

Methods

Interventional case report. A 33-year-old male presented with sudden painless loss of vision and floaters in the right eye. Examination demonstrated a best-corrected visual acuity of 20/200, optic nerve head edema, retinal hemorrhages, and vitreous opacities.

Results

Nine days later, a granuloma at the optic nerve head was apparent, and the patient was treated with pyrimethamine, sulfadiazine, folinic acid, and prednisone. Six weeks after initiating therapy, best-corrected visual acuity had improved to 20/25.

Conclusion

Optic nerve involvement in toxoplasmosis is uncommon and, when it occurs, usually presents with a white inflammatory mass on the optic disk. The current case demonstrates the importance of including toxoplasmosis in the differential diagnosis of unilateral anterior optic neuropathy, even if a focal inflammatory mass is not apparent.

### Choroidal thickness in Chinese patients with non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy [^112ZqckH]. BMC Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

Results

Patients' demographics

A total of 44 Chinese patients (23 males and 21 females) with unilateral NA-AION were included in the study. None of the patients was excluded due to failure to fulfill the exclusion or inclusion criteria. The mean ± standard deviation (SD) age of the patients was 50.8 ± 10.0 years (range, 35 to 66 years) and the mean ± SD axial length was 22.69 ± 0.88 mm (range, 21.23 to 23.44 mm). The mean ± SD spherical equivalent refractive error of the eyes with NA-AION was 0.78 ± 1.14D (range: +1.00D to −3.00D). The baseline characteristics of the NA-AION patients are shown in Table 1. The normal control group consisted of 60 eyes of 60 healthy subjects (30 males and 30 females) with a mean ± SD age of 50.3 ± 1.2 years, mean ± SD axial length of 22.83 ± 0.78 mm and mean spherical equivalent refractive error of −0.18 ± 1.98D. There was no significant difference in the baseline characteristics including mean age, axial length and refractive error between the NA-AION patients with or without optic disc edema and controls (all P > 0.05). Therefore, we compared choroidal thickness between patients in NA-AION and normal control group without adjusting for age, axial length and refractive error.

### A study of the causes of bilateral optic disc swelling in Japanese patients [^1136RdWi]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

To investigate the etiology of bilateral disc swelling in Japanese.

Methods

Using Kitasato University's Department of Neuro-Ophthalmology medical records and fundus photographs of the period December 1977 through November 2010, we retrospectively identified 121 outpatients who had been initially confirmed with bilateral disc swelling.

Results

The most common cause of the bilateral disc swelling was increased intracranial pressure (ICP) (59%); followed by pseudopapillitis (16%); uveitis (8%); hypertensive retinopathy (5%); bilateral optic neuritis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) and optic disc drusen (all at 2% each); and leukemia (1%). Unknown etiology accounted for 6% of the cases.

Conclusion

Although increased ICP is the most common etiology for bilateral disc swelling, it can also be triggered by a variety of other causes. Pseudopapillitis is the most important progenitor of bilateral disc swelling in Japanese.

### Acute visual loss and optic disc edema followed by optic atrophy in two cases with deeply buried optic disc drusen: a mimicker of atypical optic neuritis [^115mwiDN]. BMC Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Our cases are interesting because ODD was too deep to be suspected on clinical examination, even after optic disc edema resolved. Although NAION was included in the differential diagnosis of ON, the sequential involvement and a weakly positive antinuclear antibody titer in one patient and the young age of the other patient were strongly suggestive of atypical ON. On the other hand, none had ocular pain, significant VA loss or progressive visual loss that are commonly associated with ON. However, because atypical ON was considered the most likely explanation, an extensive investigation for NMO and multiple sclerosis was carried out and, in one case, prolonged immunosuppressive treatment was administered. Once deeply buried ODD was detected, the diagnosis of NAION with ODD as a predisposing factor could be entertained. Although both patients had been submitted to OCT for quantification of RNFL loss, the correct diagnosis could only be established after radial swept-source or enhanced-depth SD-OCT scans had been performed. In case #2, deeply buried ODD in the unaffected eye (OS) might have been suspected on further observation, but the affected eye and both eyes of case #1 only displayed severe optic disc pallor, with no suggestion of ODD. However, since atypical ON was not supported by the finding of relatively preserved VA and the pattern of VF defect in both patients, we persisted in the search for an alternative diagnosis.

### Bilateral choroidal folds and optic neuropathy: a variant of the crowded disk syndrome? [^115q6JPk]. Ophthalmology (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose

To describe the clinical features of the syndrome that includes bilateral choroidal folds and optic neuropathy and to propose a novel etiology to explain this presentation.

Design

Observational small case series.

Participants

Three patients.

Methods

Three patients received an extensive clinical work-up including complete ocular examination, A and B scan ultrasonography, Humphrey visual field analysis, and imaging of the brain and orbit. Neurological consultation was obtained in each patient two of whom underwent lumbar puncture. The findings of this detailed investigation are reported.

Results

Each patient demonstrated bilateral choroidal folds with optic disk congestion and leakage in one eye and optic atrophy in the fellow eye. Extensive ocular and extraocular investigation failed to uncover a specific etiology. Pseudotumor cerebri, a well-documented cause of papilledema and choroidal folds, was ruled out in each case. Each patient did demonstrate variable degrees of hyperopia and shortened axial lengths.

Conclusions

The syndrome of bilateral choroidal folds and optic neuropathy may have various etiologies. Pseudotumor cerebri needs to be definitively ruled out. Normal neuro-ophthalmological investigation including lumbar puncture may indicate an alternative cause. Idiopathic acquired hyperopia in middle-aged patients who are hyperopic with shortened axial lengths may be associated with choroidal folds and a constricted scleral canal causing optic disk congestion and complicated by nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy due to a crowded disk.

### Differentiation of optic disc edema and pseudopapilledema with deep learning on near-infrared reflectance images [^1179NJ8g]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Optic disc edema can develop as a secondary manifestation of numerous pathological processes, some benign and others with serious visual and neurological consequences. Making distinctions among various etiologies depends on a comprehensive history and a thorough examination with attention to the optic disc. Common causes of optic disc edema include demyelinating optic neuritis, non-arteritic ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), retinal vein occlusion (RVO), diabetic papillopathy, papilledema, and toxic neuropathies. Papilledema signifies swelling of the optic disc due to increased intracranial pressure and can be differentiated from other causes of disc edema based on its clinical features. Pseudopapilledema, on the other hand, refers to an abnormal and elevated appearance of the optic nerve head, which is not caused by increased intracranial pressure or edema in the nerve fiber layer. In the differential diagnosis of optic disc edema, papilledema should be a primary consideration due to its potential for vision loss and significant health risks.

In recent years, internet or cloud-based artificial intelligence (AI) platforms, both paid and free, have become accessible to users. Clinicians can now develop AI models for tasks like image classification, lesion detection, and tissue segmentation. These AI models are increasingly preferred for diagnosing neuro-ophthalmic pathologies. While color fundus photographs are commonly used for AI evaluations of optic disc pathologies, studies utilizing other imaging methods remain limited. High-quality near infrared reflectance (NIR) imaging in optical coherence tomography (OCT) allows lesion visualization even on the undersurface.

In recent years, applications of AI in ophthalmology have expanded rapidly. These applications provide high diagnostic accuracy and decision support in various clinical domains, including anterior segment imaging, retinal and optic nerve analysis, glaucoma evaluation, and refractive prediction. Table 1 summarizes well-established applications of AI in ophthalmology with selected recent studies, highlighting their diagnostic performance, clinical contributions, and current limitations.

### Unilateral swollen disc due to increased intracranial pressure [^114ayE6S]. Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

Truly unilateral papilledema is rare and poses a diagnostic problem. The authors have prospectively looked for patients with truly unilateral papilledema and found 15 patients, 10 of whom had idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Neuroimaging did not indicate a reason for the lack of swelling in the other nerve. The visual deficits and outcomes were similar to those of patients with bilateral papilledema. Although monocular papilledema is uncommon, a lumbar puncture with opening pressure measurement should be considered.

### Updates on ophthalmic imaging features of optic disc drusen, papilledema, and optic disc edema [^113ZQyKj]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

The diagnosis of patients with optic nerve head elevation should focus on a combination of history, neuro-ophthalmic examination, and multimodal ophthalmic imaging. This careful approach can help distinguish ODD, papilledema, and optic disc edema of various types and avoid unnecessary brain MRI and invasive lumbar puncture procedure in those without optic disc edema. Patients with ODD may have concurrent optic disc edema from papilledema or AION, so clinical suspicion and multimodal ophthalmic imaging are critical to correctly identify these patients who are at high risk of vision loss. In the future, more studies are needed to validate imaging biomarkers of optic nerve head elevation and identify features that are not just diagnostic but also prognostic of visual outcome.

### A young woman with blurred vision and distal paresthesias [^117H5feZ]. JAMA Neurology (2015). Medium credibility.

A 29-year-old woman presented with blurred vision and distal paresthesias. Her initial evaluation revealed severe bilateral optic disc edema with distal lower-extremity sensory and motor deficits and electrodiagnostic evidence of a length-dependent mixed demyelinating and axonal polyneuropathy. The results of routine diagnostic testing, including laboratory tests, magnetic resonance imaging, and lumbar puncture, were nondiagnostic. A targeted biopsy was ultimately required for diagnosis. In this article, we discuss the differential diagnosis and outline the clinical evaluation indicated for a patient presenting with demyelinating polyneuropathy and concurrent papilledema.

### The role of unilateral temporal artery biopsy [^116B9o6i]. Ophthalmology (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose

To examine the role of unilateral temporal artery biopsy (TAB) in suspected giant cell arteritis (GCA).

Design

Retrospective interventional case series.

Participants

We identified 181 subjects from pathology and diagnostic code databases at the University of Pennsylvania Medical Center who underwent TAB between January 1990 and January 2001.

Methods

The medical records for all subjects who underwent TAB were reviewed. Follow-up information was obtained by telephone or record review for those patients who had negative unilateral TAB.

Main Outcome Measures

Follow-up information for patients with unilateral negative TAB was reviewed for potential adverse outcomes caused by missed or delayed diagnoses of GCA. Presenting signs and symptoms and laboratory values were recorded for all subjects. Comparisons of clinical profiles between subsets of subjects were performed using Fisher's exact test, significance level alpha = 0.01.

Results

Follow-up information was available for 88 (86%) of 102 subjects who had unilateral negative biopsy samples. One (1%) subjects of 88 had a subsequent positive contralateral TAB; no adverse outcomes occurred for this subject or for any other subjects with unilateral negative TAB. Compared with subjects who had unilateral positive or who underwent bilateral TAB (n = 74), those who had unilateral negative TAB (n = 88) had a significantly lower prevalence of jaw claudication (P = 0.007). Compared with subjects diagnosed with GCA (n = 39), those with unilateral negative TAB (n = 88) had significantly lower frequencies of jaw claudication (P = 0.001), "chalky white" optic disc edema (P = 0.002), and fever (P < 0.0001). Compared with subjects with positive TAB (n = 33), subjects with negative TAB (n = 148) had significantly lower prevalence of jaw claudication (P < 0.0001), "chalky white" disc edema (P = 0.0002), pale disc edema (P = 0.006), or any systemic symptom other than headache (P = 0.0002). ("Chalky white" denotes notably extreme disc pallor). The most common indications for biopsy in subjects with unilateral negative TAB were elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (74%), headache (69%), visual complaints (58%), and ophthalmic signs (52%). Although ESR was a significant predictor of positive TAB overall (unilateral and bilateral TAB) in logistic regression models accounting simultaneously for subject age (P = 0.04), ESR did not significantly predict unilateral negative status in our patients (P = 0.13).

Conclusions

In this cohort of patients, unilateral TAB was associated with an extremely low frequency (1%) of subsequent positive contralateral TAB and was not associated with adverse visual or neurologic outcomes for any subject. We conclude that in the hands of experienced physicians, a unilateral TAB is sufficient to exclude a diagnosis of GCA in populations for which clinical suspicion is low. Jaw claudication, pale optic disc edema, particularly "chalky white" disc edema, fever, or any systemic symptom other than headache should raise suspicion for a diagnosis of GCA.

### Diagnostic utility of kappa free light chain index in adults with inaugural optic neuritis [^112atezq]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In adults, optic neuritis (ON) is frequently the first clinical presentation of multiple sclerosis (MS), myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody (MOG-IgG)–associated disease (MOGAD), and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD). At the acute phase of inaugural ON (ION), several clinical, MRI, and biological features can help differentiate these diagnoses. Particularly, unilateral mild impaired visual acuity, no or mild optic disc edema, multifocal T2 hyperintense brain white matter lesions, and oligoclonal bands (OCBs) in the CSF are more suggestive of MS. By contrast, severe reduced visual acuity, bilateral clinical involvement, and longitudinal optic nerve involvement are more suggestive of MOGAD or NMOSD. Finally, perineural optic sheath enhancement and optic disc edema are more suggestive of MOGAD while involvement of the posterior part of the optic nerve and the chiasma are more suggestive of NMOSD.

Nevertheless, suggestive features may be lacking and differentiation of conditions could be difficult in some patients. Hence, physicians perform serum anti-MOG/AQP4 antibody testing when MS criteria are not fulfilled and when patients experience some clinical/MRI features suggestive of MOGAD/NMOSD. This strategy is costly and results in uncertainty about a potential MOGAD/NMOSD diagnosis until test results are received, which could take several weeks. Thus, an accessible and less expensive biomarker with high accuracy that allows for ruling out MOGAD and/or NMOSD at ION would be of value to limit costs related to indiscriminate antibody testing. Moreover, this could improve the early management of ION because the time from symptom onset of ON to the administration of high-dose IV methylprednisolone significantly affects visual recovery in patients with MOGAD and NMOSD.

### Approach to patient with unilateral optic disc edema and normal visual function [^114K5oU9]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2021). Medium credibility.

In patients with swollen optic nerve head and normal visual function, optic disc drusen (ODD) is the most common diagnosis. The best tests for detecting ODD are funds autofluorescence and enhanced-depth imaging ocular coherence tomography (EDIOCT). After ODD has been ruled out, asymmetric papilledema should be assumed to be the cause and MRI of the brain and orbits with contrast and venography should be performed in all patients. It allows one to look for indirect signs of increased inctracranial pressure (ICP), optic perineuritis, and other inflammatory or compressive processes affecting optic nerve or its sheath such as optic nerve sheath meningioma. If imaging signs of raised ICP are present, lumbar puncture should be performed with measurement of opening pressure and analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) contents in all patients with fever, meningismus or neurologic deficits as well as patients who are not in the typical demographic group for idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). Optic nerve sheath enhancement on MRI should prompt work-up for causes of optic perineuritis. When the appropriate neuroimaging is normal, the differential diagnosis is limited and ophthalmological consultation is necessary to determine whether other subtle ocular abnormalities are present on biomicroscopic and dilated fundus examination.

### Unilateral visual impairment in a patient undergoing chemotherapy: a case report and clinical findings [^1135rFR5]. BMC Ophthalmology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Visual impairment occurred as an infrequent form of chemotherapeutic toxicity and was often underestimated despite of several reports. We described a case of acute unilateral visual impairment after one cycle of intravenous chemotherapy of a normal dose, aiming at raising attention to chemotherapy-induced ocular toxicity.

Case Presentation

The patient developed a progressive vision loss in the right eye during the chemotherapy. After one cycle of intravenous chemotherapy, her visual acuity decreased by 0.6 in the right eye (VOD = 0.4) compared to the previous value of 1.0 (VOD = 1.0). No evidence of ocular infiltration was observed from the cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). During her follow-up period, we documented the ophthalmologic examinations including visual acuity, visual field (VF), visual evoked potential (VEP), electroretinogram (ERG), fundus photograph (FP), fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) and optical coherence tomography (OCT). Ophthalmoscope examination and fundus photograph showed optic disc edema, fuzzy boundary and linear hemorrhages in her right eye. Fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) revealed capillary underdevelopment at the nasal and superior temporal area of the optic disc in the early phase and capillary fluorescein leakage in the late phase. The result of VEP test suggested the impaired function of the optic nerve. Thus, a diagnosis of nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) was made by the ophthalmologist according to these results. The patient was prescribed prednisone combined with neuroprotective drugs, which did not work. After the cessation of chemotherapy, her impaired vision gradually recovered.

Conclusions

This is the first reported case of acute visual impairment in a patient who underwent chemotherapy of a normal dose. It is indicated that while receiving benefits from chemotherapy, cancer patients simultaneously suffer from the risk of vision loss.

### A unique case of bilateral nanophthalmos and pigmentary retinal abnormality with unilateral angle closure glaucoma and optic disc pit [^1171XdBu]. BMC Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Microophthalmos or 'dwarf eye' is characterized by an axial length 2 standard deviation less than age-matched controls. It is classified into nanophthalmos, relative anterior microphthalmos, and posterior microphthalmos based on the anterior segment: posterior segment ratio. Nanophthalmos can occur in association with optic disc drusen, foveoschisis, and retinitis pigmentosa, as an autosomal recessive syndrome linked to mutations in the MFRP gene. We report a case of bilateral nanophthalmos and pigmentary retinopathy with angle closure glaucoma and optic disc pit in one eye. We believe this to be the first case presenting with optic disc pit in association with nanophthalmos.

Case Presentation

A 56-year-old female presented with bilateral small eyes, high hypermetropia, shallow anterior chamber depth, increased lens thickness, mid-peripheral retinal flecks, and macular edema. She also had high intraocular pressure in the right eye, with a disc cupping of 0.9 with an Optic disc pit. The macular edema in the right eye was found to occur in association with the Optic disc pit, whereas, in the left eye, it was associated with intra-retinal hemorrhages and diagnosed as macular branch retinal vein occlusion secondary to hypertension. She was started on anti-glaucoma medications in both eyes and planned for Anti-VEGF injection in the left eye.

Conclusion

This case report is unique as it reports an association of Nanophthalmos with Optic Disc pit, with an associated angle closure glaucoma in the same eye, an association which has never been previously reported in the literature.

### Eye care of the patient with diabetes mellitus [^117Rnz1S]. AOA (2019). High credibility.

Eye care of the patient with diabetes mellitus — optic disc (diabetic papillopathy and laser-related pallor): Diabetic papillopathy is a distinct clinical entity that must be distinguished from papilledema or other etiologies of optic disc swelling and is characterized by unilateral or bilateral hyperemic disc swelling that may present with or without an afferent pupillary defect or visual field defect; diffuse microangiopathy may be associated, there appears to be no correlation with the degree of diabetic retinopathy or the level of clinical control, and diabetic papillopathy is a risk factor for progression of diabetic retinopathy. Visual acuity is usually moderately reduced and the prognosis is good, with most individuals resolving without treatment within a year and visual acuity improving to a level of ≥ 20/30. Optic disc pallor can occur following panretinal laser photocoagulation and does not result in a change in the cup/disc ratio.

### Updates on ophthalmic imaging features of optic disc drusen, papilledema, and optic disc edema [^112xMraD]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose of review

Optic nerve head elevation can be associated with vision loss. This review provides an update regarding key features of optic disc drusen (ODD) compared with papilledema from increased intracranial pressure and optic disc edema from other causes.

Recent findings

Clinical history and funduscopic examination are not sufficient to correctly diagnose different causes of optic nerve head elevation. Multimodal ophthalmic imaging is noninvasive and should be used as first-line diagnostic testing to distinguish optic disc edema or papilledema from pseudoedema. Advanced ophthalmic imaging, including enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography (EDI-OCT) and autofluorescence imaging, can visualize ODD at high resolution and determine whether there is optic disc edema. OCT angiography does not require contrast and can rapidly visualize papillary, peripapillary, and macular microvasculature and identify important vascular biomarker of ischemia and, potentially, visual prognosis.

Summary

Multimodal ophthalmic imaging can help in the diagnosis of ODD and optic disc edema and identify patients at high risk of vision loss and neurological issues in order to ensure appropriate diagnosis and treatment.

### Bilateral optic disc edema with preserved visual function not related to papilledema [^112fg2NK]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2020). Medium credibility.

Bilateral optic disc edema (ODE) with preserved visual function is typically a result of papilledema, but the causes of this finding in the absence of raised intracranial pressure have not been systematically evaluated. The goal of this study was to determine the causes of bilateral ODE with preserved visual function not related to intracranial hypertension to help in developing a differential diagnosis for this finding. We retrospectively reviewed 221 consecutive patients presenting to a tertiary neuro-ophthalmology practice over a period of 2 years. Four patients met the inclusion criteria with a mean age of 53 years (range 43 to 63), 2 patients were men and 2 were women. The final diagnoses were bilateral optic perineuritis secondary to p-ANCA vasculitis, bilateral incipient non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), hypertensive emergency, and intermediate uveitis. The patient with NAION developed an inferior altitudinal defect 4 months after presentation, but all other patients maintained normal visual function. The ODE resolved in all cases at a mean follow-up of 4.5 months (range 3 to 6 months). Optic disc edema with preserved visual function may not be related to papilledema, and this series indicates that optic perineuritis, incipient NAION, hypertensive emergency, and intermediate uveitis be considered in the differential diagnosis of these cases.

### A study of the causes of bilateral optic disc swelling in Japanese patients [^116ZeBw8]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

To investigate the etiology of bilateral disc swelling in Japanese.

Methods

Using Kitasato University's Department of Neuro-Ophthalmology medical records and fundus photographs of the period December 1977 through November 2010, we retrospectively identified 121 outpatients who had been initially confirmed with bilateral disc swelling.

Results

The most common cause of the bilateral disc swelling was increased intracranial pressure (ICP) (59%); followed by pseudopapillitis (16%); uveitis (8%); hypertensive retinopathy (5%); bilateral optic neuritis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) and optic disc drusen (all at 2% each); and leukemia (1%). Unknown etiology accounted for 6% of the cases.

Conclusion

Although increased ICP is the most common etiology for bilateral disc swelling, it can also be triggered by a variety of other causes. Pseudopapillitis is the most important progenitor of bilateral disc swelling in Japanese.

### Acute optic neuropathy in older adults: differentiating between MOGAD optic neuritis and nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy [^114nSHsv]. Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

The degrees of optic disc edema and pRNFL swelling in unilateral MOGAD-ON were lower than in NAION. The median pRNFL thickness in this older MOGAD-ON cohort was lower than we previously reported for MOGAD-ON which was 164 μm. To understand the difference, we reanalyzed the pRNFL in the subgroup of patients 45 years or older (53 affected eyes) in the previous study. While the median pRNFL in the subgroup of older patients was 162 μm, it was 125 μm among the 17 older patients with unilateral MOGAD-ON (also included in this study), which was similar to that of the full MOGAD-ON group in this study. Although we previously found an association between younger age and more severe pRNFL swelling (r = −0.24, p = 0.02), our current data suggest that the inclusion of only unilateral MOGAD-ON also contributed to the lower pRNFL thickness.

Case presentations

Case 1

A previously healthy 48-year-old woman developed sudden and painless visual loss and optic disc edema in the right eye (OD). A tentative diagnosis of ON was made and high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone was administered for 5 days, followed by oral prednisone therapy, but to no avail. Three weeks later a similar event occurred in the left eye (OS). Oral corticosteroid treatment was maintained for the following 4 months with only slight improvement in vision. The disc edema resolved and was followed by severe optic atrophy. Neurologic examination, brain and orbits computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis and extensive laboratory investigation including anti-aquaporin 4 antibody assay were unrevealing, except for a weakly positive antinuclear antibody test (1/160, granular pattern). Because of sequential involvement and the lack of significant improvement the patient was considered to have atypical ON, presumably from NMO-spectrum disease. Oral azathioprine 150 mg/day was introduced and kept for the following years. Her visual function remained stable, and significant peripapillary RNFL loss developed on sequential spectral-domain (SD) OCT examinations, directed at quantifying peripapillary RNFL. However, high-resolution OCT scanning passing through the optic nerve were not obtained.

Five years later, the patient was seen for the first time by us for a second opinion regarding her condition and her current treatment. Her vision was stable and she had no new complaints. Upon examination, visual acuity (VA) was 20/20–2 in OD and 20/25 in OS. A mild relative afferent pupillary defect was present in OS. Extraocular motility, slit lamp findings and intraocular pressure measurements were normal. The fundus examination showed diffuse disc pallor in both eyes (OU). The visual field (VF) test revealed marked sensitivity loss in the upper and lower nasal quadrants, enlarged blind spot in OD, and marked lower nasal and temporal defect associated with diffuse VF depression in OS. Swept-source (SS) OCT showed severely reduced peripapillary RNFL thickness in OU. OCT radial B-scans passing through the disc showed ovoid areas of reduced reflectivity with some hyper-reflective areas in the retrolaminar region of the disc in both eyes (Fig. 1). The findings were consistent with a diagnosis of ODD complicated by NAION. Azathioprine treatment was discontinued and she was advised to continue periodic ophthalmic examination.

### Distinguishing between myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein disease optic neuritis and nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy [^116Jp5fY]. Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Distinguishing between causes of acute optic neuropathy can be a formidable task. Although MOG antibody-associated optic neuritis (MOGAD-ON) and nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) have distinct underlying etiologies, there can be considerable clinical overlap leading to challenging diagnostic scenarios.

NAION is caused by ischemia to the anterior portion of the optic nerve head. It is seen mostly in older individuals with vascular risk factors and obstructive sleep apnea. Younger patients may also rarely manifest with this disorder. There is a wide range of visual acuities at presentation from 20/20 to no light perception. Inflammatory markers should always be evaluated in patients with suspected NAION, particularly to determine the likelihood of giant cell arteritis. Patients with NAION commonly have inferior altitudinal visual field loss and disc edema with peripapillary hemorrhages. Pain may be present in a minority of patients (∼10%, described as a dull ache over the periorbital area).NAION is associated with anomalous optic discs with small cup to disc ratios giving the appearance of a "crowded disc".

By contrast, MOG-associated optic neuritis is an antibody-associated demyelinating disorder. It typically presents as acute, unilateral vision loss, with central field defects. Pain is common, particularly with eye movements.MOGAD-ON is typically seen in younger patients with the average age at onset of 30 years, and disc edema is often a prominent feature. Patients with MOG-associated optic neuritis may also have other neurologic findings including myelitis; however, isolated, bilateral, or recurrent optic neuritis are frequent manifestations. MRI can show longitudinally extensive optic nerve lesions, and perineural inflammation may occur in about 50% of patients.(Table).

Table
Diagnostic Features That May Distinguish MOGAD From NAION

Treatment considerations for MOGAD vs NAION are important. There are no Class I studies showing benefit of treatments for NAION. Up to 50% of cases of MOGAD can have recurrent episodes that require long-term immunosuppression or monthly gamma globulin. Evidence suggests effectiveness with long-term immunosuppression using steroids, rituximab, or methotrexate in reducing the probabilities of relapse. These medications may have problematic side effect profiles, further emphasizing the importance of making the correct diagnosis.

### Choroidal thickness in Chinese patients with non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy [^111e9Qxd]. BMC Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

Methods

This observational case–control study consisted of 44 Chinese patients with unilateral NA-AION and 60 healthy Chinese volunteers. The participants were examined between October 2012 and June 2014. The study adhered to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Institutional Review Board and Ethics Committee of Capital Medical University and informed consent were obtained from all participants. The reporting of the study adhered to the STROBE guidelines for case–control studies. The diagnostic criteria for NA-AION included a history of sudden visual loss; optic disc edema at the disease onset; spontaneous resolution of optic disc edema at subsequent follow-up; optic disc-related visual field defects; and an absence of other ocular, systemic, or neurologic diseases that might influence the patient's visual symptoms or cause optic disc edema and visual impairment. Exclusion criteria included any history of eye diseases or any kind of intraocular surgery or laser photocoagulation, and history corticosteroids, sildenafil or related drugs use. Sample size was based on the number of patients presented to the clinic with NA-AION. Patients with NA-AION were further divided into two groups with or without optic disc edema.

### Updates on ophthalmic imaging features of optic disc drusen, papilledema, and optic disc edema [^115s7EC1]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Optic nerve head elevation is an important physical examination finding in the evaluation of patients with visual disturbances or vision loss. It may be associated with optic disc edema or not (pseudoedema). Common causes of optic nerve head elevation because of optic disc edema include elevated intracranial pressure (papilledema), optic neuritis (papillitis), diabetic or hypertensive papillitis, anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION), neuroretinitis, uveitis, compression, or infiltration. Excellent reviews on different causes of optic disc edema have been published elsewhere.

An important cause of optic disc pseudoedema is optic disc drusen (ODD), which are acellular, extracellular concentric mucoprotein deposits that are often calcified and found in the unmyelinated optic nerve. An apparent fullness of the optic disc may also be because of congenitally anomalous optic disc. These structural changes of the optic disc are not neurological emergencies and do not require extensive and sometimes invasive testing, in contrast to optic disc edema or papilledema. However, careful ophthalmic assessment is important as these patients are at risk of vision loss. Multimodal imaging provides information beyond the physical examination and can help narrow down differential diagnosis.

This review aims to: describe key characteristics of ODD, compare clinical characteristics and key ophthalmic imaging features of ODD, papilledema, and optic disc edema, and provide an update regarding ODD and patients with concurrent ODD and optic disc edema. Evaluation and recognition of key features of ODD and different causes of optic disc edema will ensure that patients receive appropriate diagnostic workup and treatment.

### Chronic optic disc swelling overlooked in a diabetic patient with a devastating outcome [^112g2W4z]. BMJ Case Reports (2010). Medium credibility.

We present a case of asymmetrical but bilateral, progressive, painless visual deterioration over 5 years to no perception of light, in a 61-year-old male diabetic patient referred for a second opinion. The patient had a chronic history of bilateral diabetic maculopathy and unexplained swelling of the optic discs. He was diagnosed with optic atrophy secondary to pseudotumour cerebri (termed idiopathic intracranial hypertension when underlying causes have been excluded), which was associated with obstructive sleep apnoea. The case highlights the critical importance of identifying and investigating chronic papilloedema for reversible causes; the sometimes subtle presentation of pseudotumour cerebri; and the vital role of visual field testing and diagnostic lumbar puncture for timely diagnosis. It also reminds us that chronic bilateral optic disc swelling is not a normal feature of diabetic eye disease, and that alarm bells should sound if reduced visual acuity seems disproportionate to the degree of maculopathy.

### Bilateral ischemic optic neuropathy after transurethral prostatic resection: a case report [^1115rfwr]. BMC Ophthalmology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Nonarteritic ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) is an ischemic process of the anterior portion of the optic nerve. The typical presentation is sudden and painless visual loss. The affected eye has a relative afferent pupillary defect, unless there is bilateral symmetric optic nerve disease. The typical funduscopic appearance includes sectoral or generalized optic disc edema, which may be mildly pale or hyperemic, with associated nerve fiber layer hemorrhage. The presence of optic disc edema is a requisite for a diagnosis of NAION. This process has been associated with various risk factors, including advanced age, systemic hypertension, nocturnal hypotension, diabetes mellitus, and optic disc morphology (small cup-to-disc ratio). The occurrence of bilateral simultaneous NAION is exceedingly uncommon.

Postoperative optic neuropathy has been associated with many types of nonocular surgeries. Risk factors include a combination of prolonged surgical times, acute systemic hypotension, anemia due to blood loss, or prone positioning. When optic neuropathy occurs after blood loss, simultaneous involvement of both eyes is not unusual.

We report a patient with bilateral and simultaneous anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION) after elective transurethral prostatic resection (TPR). To the best of our knowledge such a complication after TPR has not been previously reported

### Optic disc structure and shock-induced anterior ischemic optic neuropathy [^116fTFeM]. Ophthalmology (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose

To describe a patient who developed unilateral shock-induced anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (SIAION) after gastrointestinal hemorrhage followed by presumed idiopathic nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) in the fellow eye.

Design

Retrospective, observational case report and literature review.

Methods

The case history of an 80-year-old man who developed SIAION, followed by NAION in the fellow eye, was reviewed. All previously reported cases of SIAION were reviewed.

Main Outcome Measures

Neuro-ophthalmic examination, including visual acuity, funduscopy, and automated perimetry.

Results

An 80-year-old man, with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding from a duodenal ulcer, was hospitalized and received four units of packed red blood cells after he was found to be severely anemic (hemoglobin 6.7 g/dl). Three days later he complained of loss of vision of the right eye. Neuro-ophthalmic examination 2 weeks later disclosed a visual acuity of counting fingers at 6 inches in the right eye and 20/40 in the left eye, with a right relative afferent pupillary defect and a superior altitudinal visual field defect. Funduscopy revealed optic disc edema with a temporal parapapillary hemorrhage in the right eye and a small optic disc, with no cup, in the left eye. A diagnosis of SIAION secondary to anemia was made. Six weeks later he developed a new inferior altitudinal visual field defect in the left eye and diffuse optic disc swelling. He had no signs or symptoms of giant cell arteritis or polymyalgia rheumatica, his hemoglobin at this time was 11.9 g/dl, and the Westergren erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 6 mm/hour.

Conclusions

Our patient developed optic disc swelling of the right eye after an episode of gastrointestinal hemorrhage (SIAION). The disc swelling in the left eye occurred 8 weeks later, when his hemoglobin had increased to 11.9 g/dl. The timing of the ischemic optic neuropathies suggests that the acute anemia led to involvement of the first but not the second eye. The configuration of the optic disc may have predisposed not only to the second event (NAION) but also to the first episode (SIAION).

### Unilateral visual impairment in a patient undergoing chemotherapy: a case report and clinical findings [^1142jv3h]. BMC Ophthalmology (2019). Medium credibility.

Fig. 2
Ophthalmologic examinations of the right eye one week after chemotherapy ends. a: ophthalmoscope examination, b: optic disc OCT, c: visual field examination, d - f: fundus fluorescein angiography (January 5th, 2018)

One month after finishing three cycles of induction chemotherapy, concomitant intravenous antitumor therapy with radiotherapy was started. Due to the suspicious ocular toxicities of cisplatin, Nimotuzumab, a targeted agent, was recommended as an alternative treatment. The patient made the fourth visit to the ophthalmologist, and the VOD of the right eye was determined to be 0.4. The optic disc edema subsided with clear boundary, but the color of the optic disc was still gray (Fig. 3 a). OCT showed the secondary macular epiretinal membrane (Fig. 3 b). The VF improved obviously compared with the image three weeks ago, which means the function of the optic nerve had been partially repaired (Fig. 3 c). The ERG results of the right eye showed that the amplitudes of a-type and b-type wave, as well as P1-type wave were almost normal, suggesting the normal function of the retina (Fig. 3 d). The incubation period of P100-type wave in P-VEP test was lengthened, indicating that the function of optic nerve was partially impaired (Fig. 3 e).

Fig. 3
Ophthalmologic examinations of the right eye one month after chemotherapy ends. a: ophthalmoscope examination, b: macula OCT, c: visual field examination, d: ERG test, e: P-VEP test (January 25th, 2018)

After finishing radiotherapy, the patient had not been treated with chemotherapy for 3 months. She made her follow-up visit at the ophthalmic clinic and the VOD improved to be 0.5. Moreover, the color of the optic disc was not as gray as before while the macular epiretinal membrane still existed (Fig. 4 a and b). The amplitude and incubation periods of P2-type wave from the right eye were almost normal in F-VEP-1HZ test, which signified that the function of the optic nerve had been mostly repaired (Fig. 4 c). About 7.5 months after chemotherapy, the patient's visual acuity remained at VOD 0.5. The VF of her right eye improved dramatically (Fig. 4 d). The results of ophthalmologic examinations during her follow-up period are presented in Table 1.

### Detection of superficial and buried optic disc drusen with swept-source optical coherence tomography [^117WdBwn]. BMC Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Identification of ODD is of great significance in the diagnosis and differential diagnosis in eye diseases associated with optic disc. Because ODD resemble optic disc edema (ODE) in appearance, their diagnosis and assessment have been challenging. The earliest imaging modality in the diagnosis of ODD is B-scan ultrasonography, which is still the most reliable means of detecting this condition. In recent years, due to the advancement of technologies, much more detailed anatomical structure of ODD, as well as their association with surrounding tissues, were obtained by multimodal imaging techniques. It is therefore desirable to describe ODD based on these new findings.

It is reported that 62 ~ 76% of ODD are bilateral, emphasizing that bilaterality is a feature of ODD. ODD are more often located on the nasal side of the optic disc, and our results are consistent with this feature. ODD can be superficial or buried in the optic disc. According to the relative position between ODD and BMO, we classified ODD into three categories: ODD above BMO, ODD across BMO, and ODD below BMO.

### Unilateral malignant optic glioma following glioblastoma multiforme in the young: a case report and literature review [^111og2Lq]. BMC Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Malignant optic gliomas are rare, but they rapidly become lethal visual pathway tumors. We present the clinical course, treatment, and prognosis of a case of unilateral malignant optic glioma in a young man with a history of brain glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).

Case Presentation

A 21-year-old man, who had GBM 7 years ago complained of a transient shadow in his vision and presented with normal visual acuity but optic disc edema and an enlarged blind spot in the right eye (oculus dexter, OD). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a right intraorbital optic nerve tumor without a brain lesion. Chiasm involvement and severe vision deterioration occurred 3 months later. A biopsy of the right optic nerve revealed glioblastoma. Concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) prevented involvement of the fellow eye 1 year after symptom onset.

Conclusion

This report demonstrated that a regular ocular exam should be recommended for several years after GBM. In young healthy patients who are able to undergo chemotherapy and radiotherapy, visual function in the fellow eye can be preserved.

### A study of the causes of bilateral optic disc swelling in Japanese patients [^112wv6Yh]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The most common etiology for bilateral disc swelling is intracranial pressure, but it can also be triggered by a variety of other causes. In studies of Japanese patients, pseudopapillitis is the most important differentiating disease. When attempting to diagnose the etiology of bilateral disc swelling, patients should be immediately examined for the possible influence of other diseases which increase intracranial pressure.

### A rare potentially treatable cause of bilateral optic disc swelling [^1124qDwU]. BMJ Case Reports (2010). Medium credibility.

Rapid onset bilateral optic disc swelling generally indicates an intracranial problem-that is, papilloedema. However, when there is also visual loss, disease affecting the optic nerves themselves must be considered. We present the diagnostic problem of a patient with optic disc swelling and progressive visual loss. Investigations finally revealed hypocalcaemia secondary to primary hypoparathyroidism. With treatment a marked improvement in vision occurred. This reversible rare cause of optic disc swelling should not be forgotten.

### A study of the causes of bilateral optic disc swelling in Japanese patients [^113qucc7]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Although bilateral disc swelling is often encountered in routine clinical practice, there is a lack of recent Japanese reports that have studied the etiologies of this condition. Thus, understanding the most common cause of bilateral disc swelling is thought to be crucial to its subsequent diagnosis and treatment. With this in mind, we conducted a retrospective study of bilateral disc swelling in patients at Kitasato University's Department of Neuro-Ophthalmology in an attempt to identify the etiology.

### How bad can vision get in β-thalassemia? A case report and review of the literature [^111mtMQY]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Beta thalassemia is a genetic condition that disturbs the hemoglobin synthesis. Ocular involvement is relatively common in beta-thalassemia and may cause serious complications. Ocular manifestations in beta-thalassemia may relate to the anemia caused by disease, overload of iron, or the chelating agents used.

Nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) is one of the causes of disc swelling in adults, especially in old age. Optic neuropathy is a rare complication of beta-thalassemia. Anemia can cause a statistically significant reduction in the optical disc area due to changes in the optic nerve head's blood flow and oxygenation compared to the average population. In response to this decrease in blood flow and oxygen, the ganglion cells are damaged, which declines the best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) defect in the visual field and causes the relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD).

To date, no reported cases of AION have been associated with nerve damage in the major beta-thalassemia cases. This paper highlights the rare occurrence of AION in a beta-thalassemia patient and underscores the importance of regular fundus examination in these patients.

### Unilateral swollen optic disc: do not forget neurosyphilis [^116Yo8Q5]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

A 51-year-old man presented with a 3 month history of progressive right visual loss. On examination, the only abnormal findings were a right visual acuity of 4/10 and a swollen right optic disc. The patient had previously undergone MRI that had been reported as being normal and a trial of corticosteroids under the care of the referring ophthalmologist. An extensive battery of blood tests was normal apart from a rapid plasmatic reagin titre of 1:64. ELISA revealed elevated levels of total and immunoglobulin M antibodies against Treponema pallidum. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed a mild leucocytosis and mildly elevated protein content. The patient was treated with a 5 week course of penicillin. Three months after starting treatment, his right visual acuity had improved to 8/10 and his right optic disc swelling had resolved.

### Bilateral optic neuritis in a patient with idiopathic intracranial hypertension: a case report [^111LXJq3]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Both IIH and optic neuritis can present with visual loss, headache, and optic disc edema. Therefore, a differential diagnosis of IIH and optic neuritis is needed for patients with bilateral optic disc swelling. Ophthalmologists should carefully analyze the patient's history, imaging data, and demyelinating disease antibody tests. Orbital MRI can provide useful clues in differentiating the diagnosis, as optic nerve sheath enhancement has been shown to be a unique feature of MOGAD and is not commonly observed in IIH- or MS-related optic neuritis.

In this case, the patient was a middle-aged female with progressive bilateral vision loss and optic disc congestion and swelling. Orbital MRI enhancement revealed bilateral optic nerve thickening and enhancement. Initially, optic neuritis (ON) was considered. However, given her high BMI (29.1 kg/m²), MRI findings of optic nerve sheath widening and fluid accumulation, and the presence of recent headaches and tinnitus, along with LP showing an ICP of 270 mmH₂O, IIH was also considered. After further progression of vision loss and worsening optic disc swelling, we concluded that optic neuritis, not increased ICP, was the primary cause of her condition. This conclusion was supported by the improvement in her condition, as optic disc swelling from IIH is often symmetrical, with a more gradual onset. Additionally, the patient's vision improved significantly after ONTT treatment, supporting the diagnosis of optic neuritis.

Although we believe that optic neuritis was the main cause of her bilateral vision loss and optic disc edema, we cannot deny that this patient also met the diagnostic criteria for IIH. Recently, attention has been given to the occurrence of elevated ICP in patients with optic neuritis, particularly in MOGAD-related optic neuritis, which shares similar features with IIH. However, the ICP in MOGAD-related optic neuritis patients is generally only mildly elevated, with slight increases in CSF protein levels. The mechanism may be related to CSF inflammation and secondary reduced CSF absorption. The following cases specifically warned that for patients with IIH characteristics but atypical presentations or those who do not respond well to conventional treatment, bilateral optic neuritis should be suspected. They recommended timely orbital and cranial MRI to assess optic nerve sheath enhancement and MOG antibody testing to avoid irreversible optic nerve damage.

OPTIC DISC DRUSEN AS A COMPRESSIVE OPTIC NEUROPATHY

ODD are present in 0.3–2.0% of general population. ODD may be found incidentally in patients with no visual symptoms as part of a routine ophthalmic examination, or during workup for headache and optic nerve head elevation. ODD are by far most common in Caucasians. They are typically idiopathic but can occur in families with an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. In addition, ODD can occur in the setting of systemic or ocular genetic syndromes (Table 1).

Table 1
Clinical characteristics of optic disc drusen, papilledema, and optic disc edema

Although the cause is unknown, ODD formation may be related to axonopathy or abnormal axonal transport in congenitally crowded optic discs, leading to axonal rupture and release of abnormal mitochondria that serve as a nidus for drusen formation. ODD is more common in congenital optic nerve dysplasia or genetically determined small scleral canal. ODD is typically present at birth or early childhood and increases in size and number over the adolescence and move from deep to superficial with increasing age. Over time, enlarged ODD can compress and compromise neighboring axons and blood supply, leading to visual field loss.

### MOG antibody-associated disease and thymic hyperplasia: from the national multiple sclerosis society case conference proceedings [^115NLKoQ]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Differential Diagnosis

This patient presented with an optic neuritis (ON) and subsequently developed subacute meningoencephalitis. Her workup revealed positive MOG-Ab, abnormal systemic inflammatory markers, and thymic hyperplasia.

Optic Neuritis

ON is inflammation of the optic nerve, which may be due to a myriad of causes (Table 1). The characteristics of our patient's ON — severe, anterior with moderate optic disc edema, longitudinally extensive, and perineural involvement — is most suggestive of MOGAD, (Table 1). Aquaporin-4 IgG or seronegative neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD) may present with longitudinally extensive lesions, but are more likely to be posterior–even involving the optic chiasm and tracts–and less commonly involve the perineural structures of the optic nerve. Multiple sclerosis–associated ON is often unilateral in adults, is usually clinically mild-moderate in vision loss, and presents with short-segment anterior involvement of the optic nerve and has not been reported to involve the optic nerve sheath. The steroid responsiveness and dependence (i.e. recurrence of ON after withdrawal of steroids) is also typical of MOGAD and atypical, though possible, for NMOSD. Chronic relapsing inflammatory ON (CRION) may have similar presentation as our patient; however, it would be a diagnosis only if MOGAD and NMOSD testing results were negative and if she did not go on to have extraoptic neurologic manifestations. Notably, many, though not all, cases of "CRION" have been shown to be MOG-Ab or aquaporin-4 Ab positive. Granulomatous disease and tuberculosis are also potential causes for such a presentation. However, the CSF profile with mild lymphocytosis and normal protein and glucose and negative infectious studies in the CSF and serum (eTable 1,) make tuberculosis or other granulomatous disease unlikely etiologies. Moreover, there were no systemic manifestations of these diseases. Finally, although anti-MOG IgG was only modestly elevated, its persistence further supports MOGAD as the etiology. Nevertheless, transient MOG-Ab in MOGAD is well described, particularly in the pediatric population.

### Acute bilateral vision loss secondary to cerebral venous thrombosis-induced intracranial hypertension: a case report [^113GtrGt]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 23-year-old male was referred to the Ophthalmology clinic complaining of a sudden onset of bilateral blurring of vision of one week's duration. Two days prior to the Ophthalmology referral, the patient had been hospitalized elsewhere with complaints of mild fever, severe headache, blurring of vision, pain, and numbness of both upper limbs. The patient had no systemic ailments, was non-smoker, non-alcoholic, and was not on any medications prior to this. There was no positive family history. In the recent hospitalization elsewhere, he had been treated conservatively with systemic Azithromycin, Doxycycline and intravenous fluids. A systemic diagnosis was still pending at the time of the Ophthalmology referral. On examination, the best-corrected visual acuity was 6/18, N12 in the right eye, and only light perception with accurate projection of rays in the left eye. Extraocular movements were full and free bilaterally. Pupils were circular and reacting sluggishly to light on the right side. A relative afferent pupillary defect was noted in the left eye. Anterior segment examination was unremarkable in both eyes. The patient could identify 15/17 plates of Ishihara's colour vision chart in the right eye. Dilated fundoscopy revealed marked disc oedema, dilated retinal veins, and extensive retinal haemorrhages in all quadrants bilaterally (Fig. 1 a and b). Optical coherence tomography showed a normal foveal contour. An initial diagnosis of bilateral papilledema of unknown etiology was made, and the patient was referred to the Neurology department for further investigations.

### Clinical profile of-associated uveitis in an Egyptian cohort [^116aEYBc]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Several studies have shown that the typical HLA-B27-associated uveitis is anterior and either unilateral or showing alternation of activity between both eyes, whereas simultaneous bilateral activity is uncommon. In agreement with these studies, the most prevalent type of uveitis in our study, with respect to its anatomic location, was anterior uveitis, with which 93.5% of the studied eyes were affected. And with respect to the laterality of intraocular inflammation, in more than half of our patients (319 patients, 57.6%), ocular disease remained strictly unilateral and their other eye was not involved at least till the end of the study. In another 34.7% of our cohort, non-simultaneous activity in both eyes was the rule throughout their disease history, and only 7.8% experienced simultaneous bilateral activity at one or more points of time. About two-thirds of our patients (68.2%) were males, in agreement with the larger body of literature on HLA-B27-uveitis that reported male predominance. Few studies, though, reported slight prevalence in females.

A growing body of literature is describing the incidence and pattern of posterior segment manifestations in patients with HLA-B27-associated uveitis. A wide range of posterior segment findings have been described, including macular edema, optic disc edema, epiretinal membrane and pars plana exudates, vitritis and retinal vasculitis. Our rates of posterior segment findings are not far from those published by other authors.

Macular edema, in particular, could be either a part of a genuine posterior segment inflammation, or a mere complication of moderate to severe anterior uveitis. In our study, macular edema was found in 101 eyes with HLA-B27-associated uveitis (12.8%), 73 of which had macular edema in the context of significant anterior segment inflammation, whereas in the remaining 28 eyes, macular edema coexisted with signs of true posterior segment involvement as dense vitritis, pars plana exudates, and retinal vasculitis. Similar rates of macular edema in eyes with HLA-B27-associated uveitis have been reported by other studies.

Case report

A 56-year-old female presented to us with the best-corrected vision of 6/24 in both eyes with + 10.5 DS RE (Right eye) and + 10.75 DS LE (Left eye) respectively. Near vision was N6 in both eyes with + 2.25 DS. Ocular examination revealed a horizontal corneal diameter (HCD) of 10.5 mm in RE and 11 mm in LE with a shallow ACD (Van Herick's grade 2) in both eyes. Both eyes had a patent peripheral iridotomy with RAPD (relative afferent pupillary defect) in the RE. On gonioscopy, both angles had 360-degree peripheral anterior synechiae with a clear lens. Her intraocular pressure (IOP) measured by applanation tonometry was 28 mm Hg in the RE and 14 mm Hg in the LE. She was on four anti-glaucoma medications (AGM) in RE (Travoprost, Pilocarpine, and Brimonidine-Timolol) and on Travoprost in LE. The retina had yellowish pigmentary flecks in the mid-peripheral zone in both eyes. RE had a medium size optic disc with a 0.9 cup: disc ratio with an Optic disc pit (ODP) in the superotemporal quadrant with accompanying subretinal fluid extending to the macular region (Fig. 1). LE had a medium-sized disc with 0.2 CDR, macular edema, and faint intraretinal hemorrhages in the inferior macular region (Fig. 2).

### Using diffuse weighted image and apparent diffusion coefficient in MRI for diagnosis of posterior ischemic optic neuropathy in a young male: a case report and literature review [^115RiEJ9]. BMC Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusion

Acute ON due to inflammatory demyelination process is the most common optic neuropathy affecting young adults. It is characterized by acute unilateral vision loss, positive RAPD and pain with eye movement. Patients with typical ON are usually expected to have a significant recovery of visual acuity in weeks to months after their initial symptoms. Although its clinical manifestation is similar with ON, ION usually occurs in the elderly, with an annual incidence estimated at 2.3 to 10.2 cases per 100,000 persons 50 years of age or older, and it seldom occurs in young people. ION is the result of vascular insufficiency instead of inflammation, which is classified into anterior and posterior ION depending on the segment of optic nerve that is affected. Anterior ION involves optic nerve head and presents with disc edema while PION involves retrobulbar optic nerve and shows normal optic disc. PION is relatively uncommon compared with its counterpart. Hayreh SS analyzed 1400 patients and found the relative frequencies of AION and PION were 96% and 4% respectively. The etiology of PION can be classified into three main categories: arteritic PION due to giant cell arteritis, non-arteritic PION usually associated with vascular risk factors, and perioperative PION in patients who have undergone prolonged surgery. Non-arteritic PION is a multifactorial disease, Hayreh SS retrospectively reviewed 53 eyes with PION of 42 patients and found that the non-arteritic PION group has a higher prevalence of hypertension(p = 0.022), diabetes (p = 0.014), ischemic heart disease (p = 0.026), cerebrovascular disorder (p = 0.006), carotid artery and peripheral vascular disease (p < 0.0001), migraine (p = 0.039), and gastrointestinal ulcer (p = 0.011) than the age-matched control population in the US Caucasian population. These disease may contribute risk factors for the development of non-arteritic PION.

### Leber hereditary optic neuropathy: current perspectives [^113KjzPG]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Clinical features of vision loss

LHON usually presents as painless, subacute, central visual loss in one eye. Weeks to months later, the second eye becomes involved, with a median delay of 6–8 weeks. Within 1 year, 97% of those affected have involvement of the second eye, such that a patient presenting with a unilateral optic neuropathy for longer than 1 year is highly unlikely to suffer from LHON-related vision loss. Approximately 25% have bilateral simultaneous vision loss, but in some individuals it may be that vision loss in the first eye is not noticed before the second eye becomes involved.

The majority of individuals progress to a visual acuity of 20/200 or worse. Due to preferential involvement of the papillomacular bundle, the earliest visual field abnormality is a cecocentral scotoma (Figure 1), which can enlarge to become a larger central defect. Dyschromatopsia is common and usually parallels the degree of visual acuity loss. Pupillary light reflexes usually remain intact due to relative sparing of melanopsin-containing RGCs. This subset of RGCs are thought to be more resistant to metabolic insult from mitochondrial dysfunction when compared with all RGCs. In cases of asymmetric bilateral or monocular vision loss, however, a relative afferent pupillary defect can occur.

On fundus examination preceding or during the acute stage of vision loss, there can be characteristic findings, including optic disc hyperemia, peripapillary telangiectatic blood vessels, vascular tortuosity, and swelling of the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) around the optic disc (Figure 2A) without corresponding leakage on fluorescein angiography (sometimes termed "pseudoedema"). The fundus can look normal in 20%–40% of those in the active stage of vision loss, which can delay diagnosis. Eventually, as the disease progresses, disc hyperemia, peripapillary telangiectasias, and pseudoedema resolve. Approximately 6 weeks after onset of vision loss, optic disc pallor develops and can be accompanied by cupping of the optic disc, reflecting the death of RGCs that occurs in the chronic atrophic phase (Figure 2B).
