## Question

Do you give chemical dvt prophylaxis to patient with coagulation disorder

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether chemical (pharmacologic) DVT prophylaxis should be given to patients with a coagulation disorder, and how to approach this decision. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "coagulation disorder" encompasses and how it alters baseline thrombotic and bleeding risk. Then, I should verify the general principles of VTE prophylaxis and the need for individualized risk–benefit assessment. Next, I will examine specific scenarios such as thrombophilia, cirrhosis, and acquired coagulopathies like DIC, and consider pregnancy and trauma contexts. Finally, I will synthesize a practical decision framework and concrete recommendations, including when to use mechanical prophylaxis and when to avoid or delay pharmacologic prophylaxis.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't conflate categories. "Coagulation disorder" can mean inherited thrombophilia (e.g., antithrombin deficiency, protein C/S deficiency, factor V Leiden), acquired thrombophilia (e.g., antiphospholipid syndrome), bleeding disorders (e.g., hemophilia, von Willebrand disease), or liver disease–related coagulopathy. Critically, some of these increase thrombotic risk while others increase bleeding risk, so a blanket answer would be unsafe.

> I need to check the foundational principle before jumping to specifics. All major guidance emphasizes individualized risk assessment: weigh VTE risk against bleeding risk, and choose pharmacologic prophylaxis when the thrombotic benefit outweighs bleeding harm; hold or delay pharmacologic prophylaxis when bleeding risk is high or active bleeding is present, and use mechanical prophylaxis as bridge or alternative [^112SNedU] [^111mH5BQ] [^112YxsJ8].

> Now, let me consider inherited or acquired thrombophilia where baseline VTE risk is elevated. In these patients, hospitalization and immobility further compound risk, so pharmacologic prophylaxis is generally indicated unless there is active bleeding or a very high bleeding risk; mechanical prophylaxis should be added when pharmacologic therapy is delayed or contraindicated, and extended prophylaxis may be reasonable in very high-risk thrombophilias after discharge if bleeding risk is low [^1113t4Rr] [^111mH5BQ] [^1113t4Rr].

> Wait, let me verify a potential pitfall: I initially thought DOACs might be ideal for prophylaxis in thrombophilia because of their convenience, but hold on, I should verify guideline positions. For antiphospholipid syndrome, CHEST recommends adjusted-dose VKA rather than DOACs for treatment; while that pertains to therapeutic anticoagulation rather than prophylaxis, it underscores that DOACs may be less reliable in APS, so if a patient with APS requires prophylaxis, I should prefer LMWH or UFH and avoid DOACs in this subgroup pending stronger evidence [^1148yTai] [^114bYgHm].

> Next, I should review cirrhosis, where the hemostatic balance is paradoxical. Despite elevated INR and thrombocytopenia, patients with cirrhosis have substantial VTE risk in the hospital, and the AGA suggests standard pharmacologic prophylaxis when otherwise indicated, with very low certainty evidence and no clear increase in major bleeding in observational data. I need to ensure platelets are above a pragmatic threshold (often > 50,000/µL) and there is no active variceal bleeding before starting LMWH or UFH, and I should monitor closely for bleeding [^112HVdgn] [^115JZTqC].

> I will now examine acquired coagulopathies such as DIC. The ISTH guidance supports prophylactic-dose UFH or LMWH in critically ill, non-bleeding patients with DIC, recognizing the absence of direct outcome trials; I should confirm there is no active bleeding, severe thrombocytopenia, or recent intracranial hemorrhage before initiating pharmacologic prophylaxis, and otherwise rely on mechanical methods [^113wFFzA].

> But wait, what if the "coagulation disorder" is a bleeding disorder like hemophilia or severe thrombocytopenia? In these settings, pharmacologic prophylaxis is generally contraindicated or deferred; mechanical prophylaxis with IPC is the mainstay, and any consideration of pharmacologic therapy requires hematology input and careful bleeding-risk mitigation, including platelet thresholds and local bleeding history [^117Etv6o] [^111xzu9q].

> Let me think about pregnancy and the immediate postpartum period, where physiology creates a prothrombotic state. For pregnant patients at increased VTE risk, including those with thrombophilia, LMWH prophylaxis is recommended. Postpartum prophylaxis is advised for high-risk thrombophilias or prior VTE, with dosing adjusted for weight and renal function, and antifactor Xa monitoring considered in special circumstances [^1113t4Rr] [^116FuAGr].

> I should double-check trauma and neurocritical care contexts, where coagulopathy and CNS injury complicate decisions. In trauma with coagulopathy, hold pharmacologic prophylaxis until bleeding is controlled, then start as soon as feasible because hypercoagulability emerges; in intracranial hemorrhage, begin IPC immediately and consider adding prophylactic-dose UFH or LMWH after hematoma stability is confirmed, typically after 24–48 hours, balancing VTE prevention against rebleeding risk [^117Etv6o] [^112MjDEm] [^111xzu9q].

> Next, I should review practical implementation details so I don't miss safety steps. Use standard prophylactic doses unless there is renal impairment, obesity, or pregnancy. Adjust LMWH for creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min or use UFH, consider anti-Xa levels in pregnancy or extreme body weight, and reassess bleeding and thrombotic risk daily to decide on continuation, escalation, or holding doses. Avoid unnecessary interruptions because even missing one dose increases VTE risk [^117Etv6o] [^111xzu9q] [^113fpjNE].

> Let me synthesize a decision framework, and I should confirm it aligns with guidelines. If VTE risk clearly exceeds bleeding risk, give pharmacologic prophylaxis with LMWH or UFH and add mechanical prophylaxis when feasible; if bleeding risk clearly exceeds VTE risk, use mechanical prophylaxis alone and avoid pharmacologic therapy; if risks are balanced, consider combined prophylaxis with close monitoring or prioritize mechanical methods; in all cases, reassess daily and tailor to the specific coagulation disorder and clinical context [^111EwY4R] [^117EJkms] [^112SNedU].

> Final answer: Yes, chemical DVT prophylaxis can and often should be given to patients with coagulation disorders, but the decision must be individualized based on whether the disorder increases thrombosis versus bleeding risk. Prioritize pharmacologic prophylaxis in thrombophilia and cirrhosis without active bleeding, use mechanical prophylaxis when bleeding risk is high or pharmacologic therapy is contraindicated, and involve hematology for bleeding disorders or complex cases [^116FuAGr] [^112HVdgn] [^111EwY4R].

In select patients with coagulation disorders, **pharmacologic DVT prophylaxis is appropriate** when the thrombotic risk outweighs the bleeding risk, using LMWH or UFH at standard prophylactic doses and adjusting for renal function and platelet count [^111EwY4R] [^114AzfNr]. In high bleeding risk or active bleeding, use **mechanical prophylaxis alone** and avoid pharmacologic prophylaxis until bleeding risk is acceptable [^117Etv6o] [^111xzu9q]. For thrombophilia, consider prophylaxis during high-risk periods (pregnancy, postpartum, surgery, immobilization) and use LMWH preferentially in pregnancy and postpartum [^1113t4Rr] [^116FuAGr]. In cirrhosis, prophylaxis is reasonable if platelets are ≥ 50,000/µL and there is no active bleeding, with close monitoring [^112HVdgn] [^115JZTqC]. Always individualize decisions and reassess bleeding and thrombotic risk daily [^112SNedU] [^112YxsJ8].

## Indications for pharmacologic DVT prophylaxis in coagulation disorders

Pharmacologic prophylaxis is indicated when the **thrombotic risk outweighs the bleeding risk**, such as:

- **Thrombophilia**: Antithrombin deficiency, protein C or S deficiency, factor V Leiden, prothrombin G20210A mutation, or antiphospholipid syndrome [^1146hMgo] [^116FuAGr].

- **Pregnancy and postpartum**: Especially with prior VTE, cesarean delivery, or thrombophilia [^111oBJ92] [^116FuAGr].

- **Surgery or immobilization**: Major orthopedic, abdominal, or pelvic surgery, or prolonged immobility [^117EJkms] [^1148Jfis].

- **Active cancer**: Particularly with chemotherapy or surgery [^117N7wec] [^114UAmje].

---

## Contraindications and precautions

Pharmacologic prophylaxis should be avoided or used with caution in the following situations:

- **Active bleeding**: Overt bleeding or high bleeding risk [^111xzu9q] [^117Etv6o].

- **Severe thrombocytopenia**: Platelet count < 50,000/µL [^notfound].

- **Severe renal impairment**: Creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min (prefer UFH or adjust LMWH dose) [^113fpjNE].

- **Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT)**: Use alternatives (e.g. fondaparinux) [^notfound].

---

## Recommended pharmacologic agents and dosing

| **Agent** | **Standard prophylactic dose** | **Renal impairment** | **Pregnancy** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Enoxaparin (LMWH) | 40 mg SC once daily | Adjust dose if CrCl < 30 mL/min | Safe; preferred |
| Dalteparin (LMWH) | 5,000 IU SC once daily | Adjust dose if CrCl < 30 mL/min | Safe; preferred |
| Unfractionated heparin (UFH) | 5,000 IU SC every 8–12 hours | No adjustment | Safe; preferred if renal impairment |
| Fondaparinux | 2.5 mg SC once daily | Avoid if CrCl < 30 mL/min | Limited data; use cautiously |

## Special considerations

### Thrombophilia

In thrombophilia, **high-risk thrombophilias** (antithrombin deficiency, protein C or S deficiency, antiphospholipid syndrome) warrant prophylaxis during high-risk periods (pregnancy, postpartum, surgery, immobilization) [^116FuAGr]. LMWH is preferred in **pregnancy and postpartum** because of safety and efficacy [^1113t4Rr] [^116FuAGr].

---

### Cirrhosis

In cirrhosis, **platelet threshold** ≥ 50,000/µL without active bleeding supports prophylaxis, with close monitoring for bleeding [^notfound].

---

### Hemophilia and other bleeding disorders

In hemophilia and other bleeding disorders, **mechanical prophylaxis** is preferred; pharmacologic prophylaxis is reserved for select high-risk cases with hematology input.

---

## Monitoring and adjustment

Monitoring and adjustment should include **daily bleeding risk assessment** and platelet counts, with dose adjustments based on renal function and platelet count [^113fpjNE] [^115oNJLm]. Anti-Xa levels can be checked when indicated (e.g. obesity, renal impairment, pregnancy) to guide LMWH dosing [^117Etv6o] [^1179qP6H].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Individualized assessment**: Balance thrombotic and bleeding risks [^112SNedU] [^112YxsJ8].

- **Pharmacologic prophylaxis**: Use LMWH or UFH at standard doses unless contraindicated [^111mH5BQ] [^114AzfNr].

- **Mechanical prophylaxis**: Use when pharmacologic prophylaxis is contraindicated or as adjunct [^117Etv6o] [^111xzu9q].

- **Special populations**: Adjust for renal impairment, pregnancy, and bleeding disorders [^1113t4Rr] [^112HVdgn].

---

Pharmacologic DVT prophylaxis is appropriate in patients with coagulation disorders when the thrombotic risk outweighs the bleeding risk, with **LMWH or UFH as first-line agents** and individualized dosing and monitoring.

Neurocritical care venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis — burden, scope, and methods are outlined: The estimated worldwide incidence of VTE is one to two cases per 1000 annually, with incidences as high as four per 1000 annually, and in adults admitted to the ICU the prevalence of clinically evident deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) is at least 20 per 1000 patients, with a frequency of at least 14.5 per 1000 patients despite pharmacological thromboprophylaxis. Multiple factors contribute to this risk in neurocritical care, including increased venous stasis from paralysis and prolonged coma, and cerebrovascular disorders such as ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke increase the risk of clot formation through secondary effects on the vascular endothelium. The goal of this guideline is to provide clinicians with an evidence-based framework for the appropriate administration of thromboprophylaxis in patients with neurologic illness requiring neurocritical care, including patients with ischemic stroke, intracranial and intraventricular hemorrhage (ICH and IVH), aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH), traumatic brain injury (TBI), spinal cord injury (SCI), brain neoplasms, neuromuscular disorders, and those undergoing neurosurgical and neurovascular interventions. Methods include a literature search beginning 30 years prior to January 1, 2013, with randomized controlled studies given priority and meta-analyses included; when such studies were not available, case series and retrospective studies were incorporated, and evidence was analyzed using the GRADE scale.

ASH 2019 surgical VTE prophylaxis — combined mechanical and pharmacological prophylaxis versus mechanical prophylaxis alone: For patients undergoing major surgery, the ASH guideline panel suggests using combined mechanical and pharmacological prophylaxis or mechanical prophylaxis alone, depending on the risk of VTE and bleeding based on the individual patient and the type of surgical procedure (conditional recommendation based on low certainty in the evidence of effects ⊕⊕◯◯). Remark: For patients considered at high risk for VTE, combined prophylaxis is particularly favored over mechanical or pharmacological prophylaxis alone. Mortality is likely no different between strategies (RR, 1.24; 95% CI, 0.67–2.30), corresponding to 3 more (4 fewer to 17 more) deaths per 1000 patients. Symptomatic pulmonary embolism is likely reduced with combined prophylaxis (RR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.13–0.90), which likely corresponds to 5 fewer (1–7 fewer) per 1000 at a baseline risk assumed to be 0.8% or 1.1% and to 7 fewer (1–10 fewer) per 1000 in a higher-risk population. Symptomatic proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (RR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.07–6.75) and symptomatic distal DVT (RR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.06–2.42) may be similar between interventions. Combined prophylaxis likely increases major bleeding (RR, 2.23; 95% CI, 1.09–4.57), corresponding to 14 more (1–42 more) per 1000 patients, and major reoperation rates may be similar (RR, 2.26; 95% CI, 0.73–12.05), corresponding to 4 more (1 fewer to 21 more) per 1000 patients. The overall certainty in the evidence of effects was rated as low, and the panel concluded that for patients at high risk for VTE and major bleeding risk low, combined mechanical and pharmacological prophylaxis should be considered, whereas for patients at high bleeding risk, mechanical prophylaxis methods alone may be preferred.

### Practices to prevent venous thromboembolism: a brief review [^116pJKpW]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2014). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Strong evidence from numerous high quality trials supports the effectiveness of VTE prophylaxis for specific populations. However, there are significant potential harms and risk stratification is necessary to ensure that prophylaxis is targeted to appropriate patients. Unfortunately, rates of VTE prophylaxis remain suboptimal, and VTE continues to be a difficult and elusive crisis in patient safety. Relatively little evidence exists on which specific interventions are effective for increasing rates of VTE prophylaxis in appropriate populations. As with other patient safety interventions, educating providers on the benefits of appropriate VTE prophylaxis alone is not an effective strategy to improve use of appropriate VTE prophylaxis. Evidence, although mostly low quality (non-randomised studies without concurrent controls), supports that education combined with other quality improvement strategies and information technology approaches such as alerts and mandatory computerised clinical decision support, appear to offer the most effective approaches to promote best practice prophylaxis use and prevent patient harm resulting from VTE.

### Deep venous thrombosis [^112dRik8]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is the third most common cardiovascular disorder, affecting up to 5% of the population. VTE commonly manifests as lower-extremity deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism. Half of these events are associated with a transient risk factor and may be preventable with prophylaxis. Direct oral anticoagulants are effective and safe and carry a lower risk for bleeding than vitamin K antagonists. Many patients with VTE will have a chronic disease requiring long-term anticoagulation. Postthrombotic syndrome affects 25% to 40% of patients with DVT and significantly impacts function and quality of life.

### American Society of Hematology 2019 guidelines for management of venous thromboembolism: prevention of venous thromboembolism in surgical hospitalized patients [^116Ex7jv]. Blood Advances (2019). High credibility.

ASH 2019 VTE prevention — combined pharmacological and mechanical prophylaxis in major surgery: For patients undergoing major surgery who receive pharmacologic prophylaxis, the panel suggests using combined prophylaxis with mechanical and pharmacological methods over pharmacological prophylaxis alone (conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence of effects). Mortality may show no difference between combined and pharmacological prophylaxis alone (RR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.06–1.38), corresponding to 5 fewer (7 fewer to 3 more) deaths per 1000 patients. There may be a reduction in symptomatic pulmonary emboli (PEs) with combined prophylaxis (RR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.25–0.65). The risks of symptomatic proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (RR, 0.14; 95% CI, 0.01–2.63) and symptomatic distal DVT (RR, 1.99; 95% CI, 0.35–11.33) are very uncertain. Rates of major bleeding may be similar (RR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.32–3.40), corresponding to 0 fewer (5 fewer to 17 more) events per 1000 patients, and the RR of major reoperation could not be estimated because there were no events in either group in 2 included trials. The panel judged that combined pharmacological and mechanical prophylaxis would be most beneficial for patients considered at very high risk for VTE following major surgery, and noted in a remark that for patients considered at high risk for VTE, combined prophylaxis is particularly favored over mechanical or pharmacological prophylaxis alone.

### Anticoagulation for perioperative thromboprophylaxis in people with cancer [^112E9zfP]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The choice of the appropriate perioperative thromboprophylaxis for people with cancer depends on the relative benefits and harms of different anticoagulants.

Objectives

To systematically review the evidence for the relative efficacy and safety of anticoagulants for perioperative thromboprophylaxis in people with cancer.

Search Methods

This update of the systematic review was based on the findings of a comprehensive literature search conducted on 14 June 2018 that included a major electronic search of Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, 2018, Issue 6), MEDLINE (Ovid), and Embase (Ovid); handsearching of conference proceedings; checking of references of included studies; searching for ongoing studies; and using the 'related citation' feature in PubMed.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that enrolled people with cancer undergoing a surgical intervention and assessed the effects of low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) to unfractionated heparin (UFH) or to fondaparinux on mortality, deep venous thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), bleeding outcomes, and thrombocytopenia.

Data Collection and Analysis

Using a standardized form, we extracted data in duplicate on study design, participants, interventions outcomes of interest, and risk of bias. Outcomes of interest included all-cause mortality, PE, symptomatic venous thromboembolism (VTE), asymptomatic DVT, major bleeding, minor bleeding, postphlebitic syndrome, health related quality of life, and thrombocytopenia. We assessed the certainty of evidence for each outcome using the GRADE approach (GRADE Handbook).

Main Results

Of 7670 identified unique citations, we included 20 RCTs with 9771 randomized people with cancer receiving preoperative prophylactic anticoagulation. We identified seven reports for seven new RCTs for this update. The meta-analyses did not conclusively rule out either a beneficial or harmful effect of LMWH compared with UFH for the following outcomes: mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.63 to 1.07; risk difference (RD) 9 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 19 fewer to 4 more; moderate-certainty evidence), PE (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.17 to 1.47; RD 3 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 5 fewer to 3 more; moderate-certainty evidence), symptomatic DVT (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.69; RD 3 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 7 fewer to 7 more; moderate-certainty evidence), asymptomatic DVT (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.05; RD 11 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 23 fewer to 4 more; low-certainty evidence), major bleeding (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.48; RD 0 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 10 fewer to 15 more; moderate-certainty evidence), minor bleeding (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.33; RD 1 more per 1000, 95% CI 34 fewer to 47 more; moderate-certainty evidence), reoperation for bleeding (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.50; RD 4 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 22 fewer to 26 more; moderate-certainty evidence), intraoperative transfusion (mean difference (MD) -35.36 mL, 95% CI -253.19 to 182.47; low-certainty evidence), postoperative transfusion (MD 190.03 mL, 95% CI -23.65 to 403.72; low-certainty evidence), and thrombocytopenia (RR 3.07, 95% CI 0.32 to 29.33; RD 6 more per 1000, 95% CI 2 fewer to 82 more; moderate-certainty evidence). LMWH was associated with lower incidence of wound hematoma (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.92; RD 26 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 39 fewer to 7 fewer; moderate-certainty evidence). The meta-analyses found the following additional results: outcomes intraoperative blood loss (MD -6.75 mL, 95% CI -85.49 to 71.99; moderate-certainty evidence); and postoperative drain volume (MD 30.18 mL, 95% CI -36.26 to 96.62; moderate-certainty evidence). In addition, the meta-analyses did not conclusively rule out either a beneficial or harmful effect of LMWH compared with Fondaparinux for the following outcomes: any VTE (DVT or PE, or both; RR 2.51, 95% CI 0.89 to 7.03; RD 57 more per 1000, 95% CI 4 fewer to 228 more; low-certainty evidence), major bleeding (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.23; RD 8 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 16 fewer to 7 more; low-certainty evidence), minor bleeding (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.34 to 2.05; RD 8fewer per 1000, 95% CI 33 fewer to 52 more; low-certainty evidence), thrombocytopenia (RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.04 to 3.30; RD 14 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 20 fewer to 48 more; low-certainty evidence), any PE (RR 3.13, 95% CI 0.13 to 74.64; RD 2 more per 1000, 95% CI 1 fewer to 78 more; low-certainty evidence) and postoperative drain volume (MD -20.00 mL, 95% CI -114.34 to 74.34; low-certainty evidence) AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We found no difference between perioperative thromboprophylaxis with LMWH versus UFH and LMWH compared with fondaparinux in their effects on mortality, thromboembolic outcomes, major bleeding, or minor bleeding in people with cancer. There was a lower incidence of wound hematoma with LMWH compared to UFH.

### ACP recommendations for VTE prophylaxis in hospitalized patients… [^111mH5BQ]. AAFP (2012). Low credibility.

Recommendations Patients should be assessed for the risk of thromboembolism and bleeding before the initiation of VTE prophylaxis. The decision to initiate VTE prophylaxis should be based on the patient's individual risk of thromboembolism and bleeding, and the balance of benefits versus harms. Although there are many tools for assessing thromboembolism risk, there is insufficient evidence to recommend one over the others. General evidence regarding risk factors also may be used to make decisions about the need for prophylaxis. Heparin or a related drug can increase the risk of bleeding, especially in older patients; women; patients with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cancer, alcoholism, liver disease, severe chronic kidney disease, peptic ulcer disease, anemia, poor treatment adherence, previous stroke or intracerebral hemorrhage, bleeding lesions, or bleeding disorder; and in patients taking certain concomitant medications.

Prophylaxis with heparin or a related drug is recommended unless the risk of bleeding outweighs the likely benefits. Prophylaxis with heparin has been shown to significantly reduce pulmonary embolisms in hospitalized patients, although bleeding events were increased. In most patients, the clinical benefit of decreased pulmonary embolisms outweighs the risk of bleeding. Evidence is insufficient to conclude that these risks and benefits differ in patients with stroke, although prevention of recurrent stroke may be an added benefit in these patients. The optimal duration of heparin therapy is unclear. The benefits and risks are not significantly different between low-molecular-weight heparin and unfractionated heparin, and fondaparinux has not been directly compared with heparin. The choice of medication should be based on ease of use, adverse effect profile, and cost. Mechanical prophylaxis with graduated compression stockings is not recommended.

Use of graduated compression stockings was not shown to be effective in preventing VTE or reducing mortality, and can cause clinically important damage to the skin. Intermittent pneumatic compression may be a reasonable option if heparin is contraindicated, because evidence suggests that it is beneficial in patients undergoing surgery. However, the therapy has not been sufficiently evaluated as a stand-alone intervention in other patients.

### Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in the trauma intensive care unit: an American Association for the Surgery of Trauma critical care committee clinical consensus document [^111xzu9q]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2021). Medium credibility.

When is it appropriate to hold doses of VTE chemoprophylaxis?

Recommendation

Once pharmacological prophylaxis is initiated, it should only be held or stopped for significant or potentially significant bleeding events and development of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.

Discussion

The use of chemoprophylaxis is associated with a significant reduction in the risk of VTE. Initiation early during hospitalization in patients at high risk for the development of VTE is considered standard of care. However, initiation must be balanced with risk of bleeding, and as a result should be started when the risk of bleeding is acceptable. Once initiated, continuous therapy is essential. Interruption of VTE prophylaxis for a period of 24 hours and even missing a single dose is associated with an increased risk of VTE. As a result, chemoprophylaxis once initiated should be only held under unique circumstances. Despite this, interruption is common and up to 40% of patients have chemoprophylaxis held at some point or another. Interruptions due to surgery and procedures are an even more common reason for inconsistent chemoprophylaxis administration. Debate surrounds which operations and procedures are safe to continue chemoprophylaxis without interruption. Absolute indications for holding chemoprophylaxis include active hemorrhage and recent spine or intracranial surgery. However, the optimal timing of restarting chemoprophylaxis in this patient population remains uncertain and ranges between 24 and 72 hours without clear data to guide decision making. Upcoming surgery or invasive procedures are considered relative indications for holding chemoprophylaxis. Outside of spine and intracranial surgery, little to no data exist demonstrating that continuing chemoprophylaxis without interruption leads to increased bleeding complications. In patients with a low risk of bleeding complications but high risk of VTE, chemoprophylaxis should be continued uninterrupted. If interruption in chemoprophylaxis is indicated, mechanical prophylaxis should be instituted prior to interruption and preferably continued in combination with re-initiation of pharmacological prophylaxis.

### American Society of Hematology 2021 guidelines on the use of anticoagulation for thromboprophylaxis in patients with COVID-19 [^113nie4B]. Blood Advances (2021). High credibility.

American Society of Hematology (ASH) COVID-19 thromboprophylaxis — critical illness: The ASH guideline panel suggests using prophylactic-intensity over intermediate-intensity or therapeutic-intensity anticoagulation for patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)–related critical illness who do not have suspected or confirmed venous thromboembolism (VTE) (conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence about effects). Patients with COVID-19–related critical illness are defined as those suffering from an immediately life-threatening condition who would typically be admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU), with examples including patients requiring hemodynamic support, ventilatory support, and renal-replacement therapy. Clinicians should weigh the potential benefits and harms based on the most up-to-date available evidence in caring for their patients, and the panel plans to update this recommendation when full trial results become available. An individualized assessment of thrombosis and bleeding risk is important; higher-intensity anticoagulation may be preferred for patients judged to be at high thrombotic risk and low bleeding risk. There is no direct high-certainty evidence comparing different anticoagulant agents, and selection may be based on availability, resources, familiarity, minimization of personal protective equipment exposure, and patient-specific factors such as renal function, history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, and concerns about gastrointestinal tract absorption.

Major trauma — benefits and harms evidence for pharmacological prophylaxis vs no prophylaxis: The panel is uncertain about mortality benefit (RR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.84–1.07) and notes pharmacological prophylaxis may reduce symptomatic pulmonary embolisms (PEs) (RR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.33–0.72) and deep vein thromboses (DVTs) (RR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.38–0.69), with uncertain effects on distal DVTs (RR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.5–1.29); harms may include more major bleeding (RR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.12–1.37) with very uncertain effect on need for reoperation (RR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.82–1.35), and overall certainty in the evidence of effects was rated very low.

### Person-centred prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism [^112YxsJ8]. Age and Ageing (2019). Medium credibility.

All medical admissions should receive risk assessment for the value of prophylaxis against venous thromboembolism. Unfortunately, for such patients the risk of thromboembolism is closely balanced with the risk of haemorrhage exaggerated by chemical prophylaxis. The recent NICE guideline continues to recommend comprehensive risk assessment, and to use prophylaxis where the risk of thromboembolism exceeds the risk of bleeding. The widely used Department of Health Risk Assessment Tool does not rank the risks of thromboembolism and bleeding, but NICE was unable to mandate another assessment tool fit for the purpose in the UK. Validated risk scores are used elsewhere, and could enable safer and better targeted prophylaxis, pending further research in the UK.

Prevention of recurrent VTE in pregnant women — evidence base and risk stratification indicates very limited direct randomized evidence and reliance on indirect data, with two randomized trials in pregnant women having very small sample sizes (n = 40 and n = 16) and observational estimates of recurrent VTE while using pharmacologic prophylaxis ranging from 0% to 15%. Given the low quality of the direct evidence, indirect evidence from other patient populations is used to inform antenatal prevention recommendations, while baseline risk estimates are based on observational studies of pregnant women with previous VTE. Patients are categorized during pregnancy as low risk (major transient risk factor for VTE), intermediate (hormone- or pregnancy-related or unprovoked VTE), or high risk (multiple prior unprovoked VTE or persistent risk factors, such as paralysis), and clinicians can use these groups to determine anticipated absolute effects of LMWH.

### AAOS clinical practice guideline summary: management of hip fractures in older adults [^111mzJBh]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2022). High credibility.

Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis — hip fracture patients: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis should be used in hip fracture patients, with Quality of Evidence: Moderate and Strength of Recommendation: Strong, and the recommendation was upgraded. In the absence of a contraindication, mechanical prophylaxis can be applied with good efficacy for decreasing VTE, reasonable cost, and little risk to patient safety. For chemical prophylaxis, moderate quality evidence suggests that this may decrease patient risk of VTE/PE with minimal risk of increased hemorrhagic consequences, but there is however insufficient evidence to recommend a specific pharmacologic agent or duration of treatment; patient specific factors should be considered when choosing an anticoagulated agent such as patient immobility, comorbidities, or bleeding risks. Patients with hip fracture are at high risk for deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, and the consequences of symptomatic VTE are significant and include both increased morbidity and mortality; given the potentially dire consequences of a VTE and the relatively low risk of VTE prophylaxis, the committee voted to upgrade this to a strong recommendation despite the moderate evidence.

### Deep vein thrombosis and its prevention in critically ill adults… [^115rbtPW]. JAMA Network (2001). Excellent credibility.

Venography was performed between days 10 and 14 and was interpretable in 265 patients. Sixty of 136 patients who received unfractionated heparin experienced DVT. Knudson et al32 reported a DVT rate of 3% in patients who received heparin compared with 7% in those who did not receive prophylaxis. However, this study assigned patients to heparin therapy at the discretion of the attending physician. Cohort studies of anticoagulant prophylaxis in trauma patients show variable results. Napolitano et al34 demonstrated a DVT rate of 12% with a pneumatic compression device or no prophylaxis and 9% with low-dose heparin. Another study found no benefit with heparin compared with no prophylaxis, but only 44 patients were compared.
36.

Patients assigned to GCS had a DVT rate of 33%, while those assigned to GCS plus enoxaparin at a dose of 40 mg subcutaneously once daily had a DVT rate of 17%. The rates of proximal DVT were 13% and 5%, respectively. In a small study by Frisbie and Sasahara, 72 there was no difference between low-dose subcutaneous heparin and no prophylaxis groups. In a cohort study by Merli et al, 79 patients who received the combination of low-dose heparin, GCS, and PCD had a DVT rate of 5%. Green et al74 compared fixed low-dose subcutaneous heparin with adjusted-dose heparin. Adjusted-dose heparin reduced the rate of DVT from 21% to 7%. Seven patients in the adjusted-dose heparin arm experienced major bleeding complications, none of which were intracranial or fatal, compared with no bleeding events in the low-dose heparin arm.

9Pending a full update of the 2019 guideline, the current update adds apixaban as an option for the treatment of VTE in patients with cancer and addresses recent evidence regarding direct factor Xa inhibitors for extended postoperative thromboprophylaxis. These topics were identified using ASCO's signals approach to guideline updating, which allows for an expedited response to important, recommendation-altering evidence. 10The term direct factor Xa inhibitors is used in this update rather than the previously used direct oral anticoagulants for increased specificity. P = 0.11). VTE, a secondary outcome, occurred in 1% of patients in the apixaban arm and 1. 5% of patients in the enoxaparin arm. Although patient satisfaction with ease of taking the medication was significantly higher in the apixaban group compared with enoxaparin, it is interesting to note that the adherence to the prophylactic regimen was similar:

84. 8% in the apixaban group and
83. 7% in the enoxaparin group.

21The trial excluded patients with basal cell or squamous cell skin cancers, primary brain tumors, known brain metastases, or acute leukemia. Patients were randomly assigned to 6 months of treatment with either apixaban or dalteparin. Apixaban was noninferior to dalteparin for the primary outcome of recurrent VTE during the 6-month trial period. Recurrent VTE occurred in 5. 6% of patients in the apixaban arm and
7. 9% of patients in the dalteparin arm. Recurrent VTE occurred in 0.

7% of patients in the apixaban arm and
6. 3% of patients in the dalteparin arm. 23The analysis included 100 of the 138 patients who had been randomly assigned to treatment, and risks of recurrent VTE and major bleeding did not differ significantly between study arms. Clinical interpretation.

### Practices to prevent venous thromboembolism: a brief review [^112SNedU]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2014). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Venous thromboembolism (VTE), comprised of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and/or pulmonary embolism (PE), is estimated to account for 5–10% of all deaths among hospitalised patients. In addition, non-fatal VTE events are associated with significant morbidities. In 2008, the US Surgeon General issued a Call to Action to Prevent DVT and PE. The report brings to light the huge numbers of patients afflicted by DVT (350 000–600 000) and killed by PE (> 100 000) every year in the USA.

Both pharmacological and mechanical prophylactic interventions have been demonstrated to be highly effective in preventing many, but not all, VTE. It has been estimated that best practice prophylaxis may reduce the incidence of DVT by up to 70%. The underlying pharmacological mechanism of all prophylaxis medications is to decrease clotting, and therefore they may increase the risk of bleeding. The balance between bleeding and clotting must be considered, and the harms and benefits must be weighed before administering these drugs. Blanket approaches that give the same medication at the same dose and frequency to all patients may not be beneficial and may even cause more harm than benefit. Therefore, individual patient risk assessment is paramount to ensure that all patients receive optimal prophylaxis.

Most hospitalised patients have one or more risk factors for VTE. Evidence based, best practice prophylaxis varies by individual patient risk factors (ie, cancer, advanced age, immobility, history of VTE) and primary clinical service (eg, medicine, surgery, trauma, orthopaedics). Specialty specific guidelines are often available in addition to general VTE prevention guidelines.

Despite high quality, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) showing the clinical effectiveness of prophylactic medications and mechanical devices to reduce the risk of VTE, numerous studies continue to show that many hospitalised patients are not prescribed risk appropriate VTE prophylaxis. One USA registry study found that only 42% of patients diagnosed with DVT during hospitalisation had received prophylaxis. These findings are not localised; another recent study across 32 countries found that only 59% of at risk surgical and 40% of at risk medical patients received guideline recommended VTE prophylaxis. Even as recently as Coagulation Day 2010, guideline adherence was reported to be 40% across Austrian intensive care units.

### Comparing the efficacy and safety of thromboprophylaxis with enoxaparin versus normal saline after liver transplantation: randomized clinical trial [^113eB3xW]. The British Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Vascular thrombosis poses a significant threat to patients undergoing liver transplantation and this issue has gained increasing importance given the growing numbers of donors and recipients with diabetes and obesity. After liver transplantation, approximately 15.5% of recipients have reported experiencing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with daily ultrasonography screening and upcoming complications such as pulmonary embolism (PE). Additionally, approximately 2% of patients have been diagnosed with hepatic artery thrombosis (HAT) and 3% of patients have been diagnosed with portal vein thrombosis (PVT) in the case of deceased donors, and an even higher percentage of patients in the case of living donors or split donations. The development of HAT and PVT can compromise blood supply to the transplanted liver and, in severe cases, result in elevated rates of graft loss, morbidity, and mortality for the recipient. The complications present a considerable challenge to the postoperative management plan.

Although thromboprophylaxis is well established as a means to reduce the risk of DVT after major abdominal and pelvic surgery, it is unclear whether the same strategy will reduce the incidence of DVT or PVT among patients after liver transplantation. In addition, it may increase the risk of post-liver transplantation morbidity and mortality due to haemorrhagic complications from the anticoagulation. As such, antithrombotic prophylaxis is not a standard practice after liver transplantation and, currently, there are no established protocols to guide the use of chemical thromboprophylaxis therapy in the post-transplant interval. The need for further results from multicentre, prospective RCTs is evident to enhance thromboprophylaxis strategies after liver transplantation.

Enoxaparin, a low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) at a daily dose of 40 mg, is frequently employed for postoperative chemical prophylaxis in patients undergoing orthopaedic, abdominal, and pelvic surgery. Specifically, research has indicated that enoxaparin can effectively and safely prevent PVT in patients undergoing hepatectomy.

The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of chemical prophylaxis after liver transplantation. A prospective RCT was conducted to evaluate the relationship between daily enoxaparin administration in patients after liver transplantation and the occurrence of venous thrombosis and major bleeding events.

### American Society of Hematology living guidelines on use of anticoagulation for thromboprophylaxis for patients with COVID-19: executive summary [^115fNtcS]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Recommendation 1a

The American Society of Hematology (ASH) guideline panel suggests using prophylactic-intensity over intermediate-intensity anticoagulation for patients with COVID-19–related critical illness who do not have suspected or confirmed VTE or another indication for anticoagulation (conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence about effects ⨁○○○).

Recommendation 1b

The ASH guideline panel suggests using prophylactic-intensity over therapeutic-intensity anticoagulation for patients with COVID-19–related critical illness who do not have suspected or confirmed VTE or another indication for anticoagulation (conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence about effects ⨁○○○).

Remarks:

- Patients with COVID-19–related critical illness are defined as those suffering from an immediately life–threatening condition who would typically be admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) because of COVID-19. Examples include patients requiring hemodynamic support, ventilatory support, and renal replacement therapy.
- An individualized assessment of the patient's risk of thrombosis and bleeding is important when deciding on anticoagulation intensity. Risk assessment models (RAMs) to estimate thrombotic risk have been validated in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (critically or noncritically ill), with modest prognostic performance. No RAMs for bleeding have been validated for patients with COVID-19. The panel acknowledges that higher-intensity anticoagulation may be preferred for patients judged to be at low bleeding risk and high thrombotic risk.
- At present, there is no direct high-certainty evidence comparing different types of anticoagulants. The selection of a specific agent (eg, low molecular weight heparin [LMWH] and unfractionated heparin [UFH]) may be based on availability, resources required, familiarity, the aim of minimizing the use of personal protective equipment or exposure to staff to patients with COVID-19, as well as patient-specific factors (eg, renal function, history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, and bleeding risk). LMWH and UFH were used in the identified studies and may be preferred because of a preponderance of evidence with these agents. There are no studies of intermediate- or therapeutic-intensity fondaparinux, argatroban, or bivalirudin in this population.
- These recommendations do not apply to patients who require anticoagulation to prevent thrombosis of extracorporeal circuits such as those on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) or continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT).

Summary of recommendations

Recommendation 3

The ASH guideline panel suggests that outpatient anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis not be used for patients with COVID-19 who are being discharged from the hospital and do not have suspected or confirmed venous thromboembolism (VTE) or another indication for anticoagulation (conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence about effects ⊕◯◯◯).

Remarks:

An individualized assessment of the patient's risk of thrombosis and bleeding and shared decision making are important when deciding on whether to use postdischarge thromboprophylaxis. Prospectively validated risk assessment models to estimate thrombotic and bleeding risk in COVID-19 patients after hospital discharge are not available.
The panel acknowledged that postdischarge thromboprophylaxis may be reasonable for patients judged to be at high risk of thrombosis and low risk of bleeding.

Background

Hospitalization for acute medical illness is a common risk factor for venous thromboembolism (VTE), with most such events occurring after hospital discharge. Meanwhile, there is a high incidence of thrombotic complications in patients hospitalized for COVID-19–related acute illness or critical illness. However, there are limited reports regarding rates of VTE after discharge for patients who have been hospitalized for COVID-19. Thus, there has been much interest in establishing whether postdischarge pharmacological thromboprophylaxis in this population is warranted.

These guidelines are based on systematic reviews of evidence conducted under the direction of the McMaster University GRADE (grading of recommendations, assessment, development and evaluations) Centre with international collaborators. This is an update of the previous American Society of Hematology (ASH) guideline published in February 2021and focuses on the role of thromboprophylaxis for patients discharged from the hospital after COVID-19. The panel followed best practice for guideline development recommended by the Institute of Medicine and the Guidelines International Network (GIN). The panel used the GRADE approachto assess the certainty of the evidence and formulate recommendations. The recommendation is listed in Table 1.

Table 1.
Recommendations

Values and preferences

The guideline panel identified all-cause mortality, pulmonary embolism (PE), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and major bleeding as critical outcomes and placed a high value on avoiding these outcomes with the interventions assessed.
Panel members noted that there was possible uncertainty and variability in the relative value that patients place on avoiding major bleeding events compared with reducing thrombotic events.

### Management of venous thromboembolism: recent advances in oral anticoagulation therapy [^116RUXLq]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In summary, clinicians now have multiple anticoagulant options for the treatment of VTE. DOACs represent a step forward in the management of VTE, with similar efficacy and improved safety compared with VKAs. Although the limitations of VKAs seem to concede DOACs as superior agents, attention is still required to appropriately select dosing based on indication, avoid drug-drug interactions, and consider dose adjustments for particular clinical circumstances such as organ dysfunction or concomitant medications. Clinicians treating VTE need to be familiar with the intricacies of anticoagulation therapy used in this setting. The pharmacist has unique knowledge to improve the care and successful treatment of VTE through interactions with both providers and patients.

### Antithrombotic therapy for VTE disease: second update of the CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^113Xpz9Z]. Chest (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

This is the 2nd update to the 9th edition of these guidelines. We provide recommendations on 17 PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome) questions, four of which have not been addressed previously.

Methods

We generate strong and weak recommendations based on high-, moderate-, and low-certainty evidence, using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) methodology.

Results

The panel generated 29 guidance statements, 13 of which are graded as strong recommendations, covering aspects of antithrombotic management of VTE from initial management through secondary prevention and risk reduction of postthrombotic syndrome. Four new guidance statements have been added that did not appear in the 9th edition (2012) or 1st update (2016). Eight statements have been substantially modified from the 1st update.

Conclusion

New evidence has emerged since 2016 that further informs the standard of care for patients with VTE. Substantial uncertainty remains regarding important management questions, particularly in limited disease and special patient populations.

Between online publication and print, a press release reported interim results from randomized trials in which therapeutic-intensity anticoagulation was compared with prophylactic-intensity in moderately ill hospitalized patients with COVID-19; the panel plans to update this recommendation when full results become available, and clinicians should weigh the potential benefits and harms based on the most up-to-date evidence. Patients with COVID-19–related acute illness are defined as those with clinical features warranting admission to an inpatient medical ward without requirement for advanced clinical support, with examples including dyspnea or mild to moderate hypoxia. An individualized assessment of thrombosis and bleeding risk is important; models exist but have not been validated for COVID-19, and higher-intensity anticoagulation may be preferred for patients judged to be at high thrombotic risk and low bleeding risk. There is no direct high-certainty evidence comparing different anticoagulant agents; selection may be based on availability, resources, familiarity, minimization of personal protective equipment exposure, and patient-specific factors including renal function, history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, and gastrointestinal absorption concerns.

Major gynecological surgery — pharmacological prophylaxis vs no pharmacological prophylaxis: Pharmacological prophylaxis probably reduces mortality slightly following major gynecological surgery (RR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.61–0.93), corresponding to a benefit of 4 fewer (1–7 fewer) deaths per 1000 patients; probably reduces the risk of symptomatic PEs (RR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.26–0.88), corresponding to a benefit of 1 fewer (0–3 fewer) symptomatic PEs per 1000 higher-risk patients and 0 fewer (0–1 fewer) per 1000 lower-risk patients, based on baseline risks from observational data of 0.1% and 0.4%, respectively; and probably reduces symptomatic proximal DVTs (RR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.14–1.00), corresponding to reduction of 4 fewer (0–6 fewer) symptomatic proximal DVTs per 1000 patients and 17 fewer (0–23 fewer) per 1000 higher-risk patients based on baseline risks from observational data of 0.7% and 2.7%, respectively, while we are uncertain about the effect on distal DVTs (RR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.31–0.87), corresponding to no benefit per 1000 patients treated based on a lower baseline risk of 0.1%. Pharmacological prophylaxis may slightly increase the risk of major bleeding (RR, 1.24; 95% CI, 0.87–1.77), corresponding to 1 more (3 fewer to 2 more) major bleeding events per 1000 patients, and does not appear to increase the risk of reoperation (RR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.35–2.50). The panel considered that patients at increased risk for VTE would receive mechanical prophylaxis in addition to pharmacological prophylaxis, rated the overall certainty in the evidence of effects as very low, and judged that pharmacological prophylaxis should be administered to patients undergoing major gynecological surgery, and this recommendation was conditional given the very low certainty in the evidence.

Other high-risk scenarios and when to hold VTE prophylaxis

How should VTE prophylaxis be managed with active bleeding or coagulopathy?

Recommendation

Pharmacological prophylaxis should be delayed in patients with active bleeding or coagulopathy, until these conditions have been controlled or reversed. Mechanical prophylaxis should be employed in these patients.

Discussion

It is appropriate to withhold chemical prophylaxis in patients with active bleeding or coagulopathy, or hemodynamic instability resulting from those conditions. Delaying initiation of enoxaparin should be minimized to the shortest acceptable time period, since the early trauma-induced coagulopathy soon gives way to a hypercoagulable state. In the setting of trauma coagulopathy, enoxaparin may be considered after completing the initial resuscitation, even though laboratory parameters of coagulation have not yet normalized. As holding pharmacological prophylaxis is associated with an increased VTE rate, enoxaparin initiation is encouraged if there are no signs of bleeding and the hypocoagulable state is expected to resolve. Intermittent pneumatic compression as a means of mechanical prophylaxis is an important adjunct in conditions that prohibit chemical prophylaxis, especially in patients with moderate-to-high VTE risk.

Should pharmacological VTE prophylaxis dosing be adjusted during pregnancy?

Recommendation

Dosing of pharmacological VTE prophylaxis should be adjusted in pregnant trauma patients.

Discussion

Pregnant trauma patients are at increased risk of VTE. Increases in weight and creatinine clearance make dosing adjustments for enoxaparin necessary, namely higher and more frequent dosing regimens. At admission, a pregnant trauma patient should receive enoxaparin 30 mg two times per day, and if the patient weighs > 90 kg then 40 mg two times per day should be initiated. The dosing should then be titrated by antifactor Xa levels to target a range of 0.2–0.4 IU/mL.

As the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic spread to the US, so too did descriptions of an associated coagulopathy and thrombotic complications. Hospitals created institutional protocols for inpatient management of COVID-19 coagulopathy and thrombosis in response to this developing data. We collected and analyzed protocols from 21 US academic medical centers developed between January and May 2020. We found greatest consensus on recommendations for heparin-based pharmacologic venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis in COVID-19 patients without contraindications. Protocols differed regarding incorporation of D-dimer tests, dosing of VTE prophylaxis, indications for post-discharge pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis, how to evaluate for VTE, and the use of empiric therapeutic anticoagulation. These findings support ongoing efforts to establish international, evidence-based guidelines.

Background — pregnancy-related venous thromboembolism risk is described as follows: Pregnancy itself is a condition which increases the risk of VTE 5-fold when compared to non-pregnant women, corresponding to an absolute risk of VTE of 1.22 per 1000 deliveries; physiologically, this pregnancy-induced hypercoagulability is manifested in increases in fibrin and coagulation factors II, VII, VIII, IX, X and von Willebrand factor; these hematologic changes of pregnancy begin to occur as early as the first trimester; and currently, no guidelines exist regarding thrombosis prophylaxis in these patient groups at the time of an abortion.

### Approach to outcome measurement in the prevention of thrombosis in surgical and medical patients: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^117Swu96]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Trading off symptomatic venous thromboembolism (VTE) and bleeding — Making recommendations requires deciding on whether net benefit is optimized by administering or withholding antithrombotic prophylaxis. The relevant nonfatal events in medical and surgical prophylaxis are pulmonary embolus, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and gastrointestinal (GI) and surgical site bleeding, and these events were judged to be of similar importance to patients, with DVT slightly less important and pulmonary embolus, GI, and perioperative bleeding very similar. Considering nonfatal events alone, if an antithrombotic regimen prevents more VTE events than it causes bleeding events compared with an alternative, recommendations will favor that regimen; if therapy causes more bleeding events than it prevents VTE events, recommendations will favor withholding or administering less aggressive antithrombotic prophylaxis. Given a constant relative risk reduction in VTE, the former is likely for patient groups at relatively high risk of symptomatic VTE, and for very low risk, the latter. This trade-off approach has important limitations, including ignoring fatalities, as antithrombotic prophylaxis, relative to no prophylaxis, reduces deaths from pulmonary embolus in both medical and surgical patients enrolled in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and may reduce all-cause mortality in surgical patients, and therefore, for decisions regarding which antithrombotic agent or regimen to use, the authors largely base inferences on evidence in nonfatal VTE prevention versus increases in nonfatal bleeding. A further limitation is that the judgment that bleeding events have more or less the same disutility as VTE events is fraught with uncertainty, and because studies of patient values and preferences do not exist, recommending one antithrombotic agent over another requires a substantial benefit-risk gradient between therapies, with a high level of confidence in that gradient.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for deep vein thrombosis, more specifically with respect to anticoagulation after IVC filter placement, ACCP 2016 guidelines recommend to consider administering a conventional course of anticoagulant therapy in patients with acute proximal DVT of the leg and an IVC filter inserted as an alternative to anticoagulation, if the risk of bleeding resolves.

### Thromboprophylaxis and thrombosis in medical, surgical, trauma, and obstetric / gynecologic patients [^113AuAEW]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

The International Consensus and the ACCP Sixth Consensus had a great impact on the clinical acceptance of LMWHs. These recommendations have been instrumental in initiating further clinical trial to answer key questions regarding thromboprophylaxis and in setting a new standard for patient care. Also, the key to cost containment in management of DVT/PE is to (1) define the etiology (blood coagulation protein or platelet defect), institute appropriate long-term therapy as indicated, and assess appropriate family members as indicated if a hereditary defect is found and (2) use LMWH as inpatient management. saving a minimum of 210,000.00 dollars per 1000 patients simply from cost savings of recurrence, saving 17 lives per 1000 patients, and saving exorbitant costs of care for patients with recurrence and development of chronic venous insufficiency. The use of outpatient LMWH will save 4,900,000.00 dollars per 1000 patients if applied to the 70% of patients with DVT who fit the criteria of no comorbid condition requiring hospitalization and who arrive early enough to allow a diagnosis to be sent home or hospitalized for 24 hours or less. The simple defining of defects leading to unexplained thrombosis will add another 3,000,000.00 dollars in savings per 1000 patients with DVT and approximately 350,000.00 dollars per 100 patients with thrombotic stroke. In those with transient ischemic attacks, defining the defect and instituting appropriate antithrombotic therapy, thereby potentially saving approximately 30% from developing a thrombotic stroke, amounts to approximately 350,500.00 dollars (= 30% of 1,168,500.00 dollars) in savings per 100 patients.

### DVT and pulmonary embolism: part II. treatment and prevention [^111mAF5b]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Treatment goals for deep venous thrombosis include stopping clot propagation and preventing the recurrence of thrombus, the occurrence of pulmonary embolism, and the development of pulmonary hypertension, which can be a complication of multiple recurrent pulmonary emboli. About 30 percent of patients with deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism have a thrombophilia. An extensive evaluation is suggested in patients younger than 50 years with an idiopathic episode of deep venous thrombosis, patients with recurrent thrombosis, and patients with a family history of thromboembolism. Infusion of unfractionated heparin followed by oral administration of warfarin remains the mainstay of treatment for deep venous thrombosis. Subcutaneously administered low-molecular-weight (LMW) heparin is at least as effective as unfractionated heparin given in a continuous infusion. LMW heparin is the agent of choice for treating deep venous thrombosis in pregnant women and patients with cancer. Based on validated protocols, warfarin can be started at a dosage of 5 or 10 mg per day. The intensity and duration of warfarin therapy depends on the individual patient, but treatment of at least three months usually is required. Some patients with thrombophilias require lifetime anticoagulation. Treatment for pulmonary embolism is similar to that for deep venous thrombosis. Because of the risk of hypoxemia and hemodynamic instability, in-hospital management is advised. Unfractionated heparin commonly is used, although LMW heparin is safe and effective. Thrombolysis is used in patients with massive pulmonary embolism. Subcutaneous heparin, LMW heparin, and warfarin have been approved for use in surgical prophylaxis. Elastic compression stockings are useful in patients at lowest risk for thromboembolism. Intermittent pneumatic leg compression is a useful adjunct to anticoagulation and an alternative when anticoagulation is contraindicated.

### Thromboprophylaxis in nonsurgical patients [^114AzfNr]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is an important cause of preventable morbidity and mortality in medically ill patients. Randomized controlled trials indicate that pharmacologic prophylaxis reduces deep venous thrombosis (relative risk [RR] = 0.46; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.36–0.59) and pulmonary embolism (RR = 0.49; 95% CI, 0.33–0.72) with a nonsignificant trend toward more bleeding (RR = 1.36; 95% CI, 0.80–2.33]. Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) and unfractionated heparin are equally efficacious in preventing deep venous thrombosis (RR = 0.85; 95% CI, 0.69–1.06) and pulmonary embolism (RR = 1.05; 95% CI, 0.47–2.38), but LMWH is associated with significantly less major bleeding (RR = 0.45; 95% CI, 0.23–0.85). LMWH is favored for VTE prophylaxis in critically ill patients. New VTE and bleeding risk stratification tools offer the potential to improve the risk-benefit ratio for VTE prophylaxis in medically ill patients. Intermittent pneumatic compression devices should be used for VTE prophylaxis in patients with contraindications to pharmacologic prophylaxis. Graduated compression stockings should be used with caution. VTE prevention in medically ill patients using extended-duration VTE prophylaxis and new oral anticoagulants warrant further investigation. VTE prophylaxis prescription and administration rates are suboptimal and warrant multidisciplinary performance improvement strategies.

### New insights into treatment of venous thromboembolism [^116N79gx]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2014). Low credibility.

Several advances have occurred over the last 2 years in the clinical management of venous thromboembolism (VTE), as evidenced by several high-profile publications in top-tier medical journals. The translation of the knowledge gained into routine clinical practice is an important challenge so that VTE is managed optimally and established and new anticoagulants are used effectively and safely. This chapter reviews issues of VTE treatment from acute management to treatment of long-term complications, addressing new data gained in the last 2 years and putting them into a clinical context, with the goal of improved everyday VTE management.

### Thromboprophylaxis in patients with COVID-19: a brief update to the CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^116osonP]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

Early societal guidelines regarding thromboprophylaxis in COVID-19 outline setting-specific use of unfractionated heparin (UFH) or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH). The Global COVID-19 Thrombosis Collaborative Group states that outpatient pharmacologic prophylaxis should be reserved for those at highest risk, lists prophylactic daily LMWH or subcutaneous UFH bid for in-hospital care, and indicates that individualized risk stratification should be followed by consideration of extended prophylaxis (for up to 45 d) for patients with elevated VTE risk and low bleeding risk. The International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis specifies in noncritically ill inpatients that routine thromboprophylaxis with standard dose UFH or LMWH should be used after bleed risk assessment, with intermediate dose LMWH that may also be considered; for critically ill patients, routine prophylactic dose UFH or LMWH should be used and intermediate dose LMWH can also be considered in high-risk patients, and extended postdischarge thromboprophylaxis should be considered for all hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who meet high VTE risk criteria. The Chest Guideline and Expert Panel Report recommends current standard dose anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis over intermediate or full treatment dosing for hospitalized patients with acute illness with COVID-19, suggests the same approach in critically ill patients, and recommends inpatient thromboprophylaxis only over inpatient plus extended thromboprophylaxis after hospital discharge. The VAS-European Independent Foundation in Angiology/Vascular Medicine lists routine thromboprophylaxis with weight-adjusted intermediate doses of LMWH (unless contraindication) for hospitalized care and calls for evaluation of VTE risk before hospital discharge using the IMPROVE-D-dimer score with prolonged postdischarge thromboprophylaxis with rivaroxaban, betrixaban, or LMWH. The World Health Organization notes that, without an established indication for higher dose anticoagulation, it suggests administering standard thromboprophylaxis dosing of anticoagulation rather than therapeutic or intermediate dosing in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.

### The potential role of direct thrombin inhibitors in the prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism [^116BSozv]. Chest (2003). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common and potentially lethal disease that recurs frequently and is associated with long-term impairment and suffering. Despite a great deal of effort, the incidence of VTE has not changed substantially in the last 20 years. Independent risk factors include hospitalization (either for surgery or for acute medical illness), trauma, malignant neoplasm, central venous catheters or transvenous pacemakers, superficial vein thrombosis, and extremity paresis. Of these, hospitalization accounts for almost 60% of all VTE occurring in the community. Thus, universal effective prophylaxis of hospitalized patients would significantly reduce the incidence of VTE. Parenteral direct thrombin inhibitors are safe and effective for both prevention and treatment of acute VTE, and do not require laboratory monitoring or dose adjustment. Oral direct thrombin inhibitors may also be safe and effective, and offer enhanced convenience without diet or drug-drug interactions.

### American Society of Hematology living guidelines on the use of anticoagulation for thromboprophylaxis for patients with COVID-19: March 2022 update on the use of anticoagulation in critically ill patients [^116jrSPz]. Blood Advances (2022). High credibility.

ASH living guidelines — critically ill COVID-19 thromboprophylaxis (Recommendation 1b) suggests using prophylactic-intensity over therapeutic-intensity anticoagulation for patients with COVID-19–related critical illness who do not have suspected or confirmed venous thromboembolism (VTE) as a conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence about effects (⊕◯◯◯). Patients with COVID-19–related critical illness are defined as those suffering from an immediately life-threatening condition who would typically be admitted to an ICU, with examples including patients requiring hemodynamic support, ventilatory support, and renal replacement therapy. At present, there is no direct high-certainty evidence comparing different types of anticoagulants for patients with COVID-19, and unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin was used in the identified studies. Risk assessment models used to estimate thrombotic risk in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 have modest prognostic performance, no risk assessment models for bleeding have been validated for COVID-19, and the panel acknowledges that higher-intensity anticoagulation may be preferred for patients judged to be at low bleeding risk and high thrombotic risk. This recommendation does not apply to patients who require anticoagulation to prevent thrombosis of extracorporeal circuits, such as those on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or continuous renal replacement therapy. The certainty in the evidence was rated as very low for all critical outcomes, mainly owing to serious indirectness and very to extremely serious imprecision.

### Pharmacological interventions for preventing venous thromboembolism in people undergoing bariatric surgery [^1117MbxM]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Venous thromboembolism (VTE), which comprises deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), is the leading cause of preventable death in hospitalised people and the third most common cause of mortality in surgical patients. People undergoing bariatric surgery have the additional risk factor of being overweight. Although VTE prophylaxis in surgical patients is well established, the best way to prevent VTE in those undergoing bariatric surgery is less clear.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of pharmacological interventions (alone or in combination) on venous thromboembolism and other health outcomes in people undergoing bariatric surgery compared to the same pharmacological intervention administered at a different dose or frequency, the same pharmacological intervention or started at a different time point, another pharmacological intervention, no intervention or placebo.

Search Methods

We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was 1 November 2021.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs in males and females of any age undergoing bariatric surgery comparing pharmacological interventions for VTE (alone or in combination) with the same pharmacological intervention administered at a different dose or frequency, the same pharmacological intervention started at a different time point, a different pharmacological intervention, no treatment or placebo.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were 1. VTE and 2. major bleeding. Our secondary outcomes were 1. all-cause mortality, 2. VTE-related mortality, 3. PE, 4. DVT, 5. adverse effects and 6. quality of life. We used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

We included seven RCTs with 1045 participants. Data for meta-analysis were available from all participants. Four RCTs (597 participants) compared higher-dose heparin to standard-dose heparin: one of these studies (139 participants) used unfractionated heparin (UFH) and the other three (458 participants) used low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH). One study compared heparin versus pentasaccharide (198 participants), and one study compared starting heparin before versus after bariatric surgery (100 participants). One study (150 participants) compared combined mechanical and pharmacological (enoxaparin) prophylaxis versus mechanical prophylaxis alone. The duration of the interventions ranged from seven to 15 days, and follow-up ranged from 10 to 180 days. Higher-dose heparin versus standard-dose heparin Compared to standard-dose heparin, higher-dose heparin may result in little or no difference in the risk of VTE (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.05 to 5.99; 4 studies, 597 participants) or major bleeding (RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.48 to 2.96; I² = 8%; 4 studies, 597 participants; low-certainty) in people undergoing bariatric surgery. The evidence on all-cause mortality, VTE-related mortality, PE, DVT and adverse events (thrombocytopenia) is uncertain (effect not estimable or very low-certainty evidence). Heparin versus pentasaccharide Heparin compared to a pentasaccharide after bariatric surgery may result in little or no difference in the risk of VTE (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.19 to 3.61; 1 study, 175 participants) or DVT (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.19 to 3.61; 1 study, 175 participants). The evidence on major bleeding, PE and mortality is uncertain (effect not estimable or very low-certainty evidence). Heparin started before versus after the surgical procedure Starting prophylaxis with heparin 12 hours before surgery versus after surgery may result in little or no difference in the risk of VTE (RR 0.11, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.01; 1 study, 100 participants) or DVT (RR 0.11, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.01; 1 study, 100 participants). The evidence on major bleeding, all-cause mortality and VTE-related mortality is uncertain (effect not estimable or very low-certainty evidence). We were unable to assess the effect of this intervention on PE or adverse effects, as the study did not measure these outcomes. Combined mechanical and pharmacological prophylaxis versus mechanical prophylaxis alone Combining mechanical and pharmacological prophylaxis (started 12 hours before surgery) may reduce VTE events in people undergoing bariatric surgery compared to mechanical prophylaxis alone (RR 0.05, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.89; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) = 9; 1 study, 150 participants; low-certainty). We were unable to assess the effect of this intervention on major bleeding or morality (effect not estimable), or on PE or adverse events (not measured). No studies measured quality of life.

Authors' Conclusions

Higher-dose heparin may make little or no difference to venous thromboembolism or major bleeding in people undergoing bariatric surgery when compared to standard-dose heparin. Heparin may make little or no difference to venous thromboembolism in people undergoing bariatric surgery when compared to pentasaccharide. There are inadequate data to draw conclusions about the effects of heparin compared to pentasaccharide on major bleeding. Starting prophylaxis with heparin 12 hours before bariatric surgery may make little or no difference to venous thromboembolism in people undergoing bariatric surgery when compared to starting heparin after bariatric surgery. There are inadequate data to draw conclusions about the effects of heparin started before versus after surgery on major bleeding. Combining mechanical and pharmacological prophylaxis (started 12 hours before surgery) may reduce VTE events in people undergoing bariatric surgery when compared to mechanical prophylaxis alone. No data are available relating to major bleeding. The certainty of the evidence is limited by small sample sizes, few or no events, and risk of bias concerns. Future trials must be sufficiently large to enable analysis of relevant clinical outcomes, and should standardise the time of treatment and follow-up. They should also address the effect of direct oral anticoagulants and antiplatelets, preferably grouping them according to the type of intervention.

### Standard-versus extended-duration anticoagulation for primary venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in acutely ill medical patients [^1148Jfis]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) includes two interrelated conditions, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). Risk factors include dehydration, prolonged immobilization, acute medical illness, trauma, clotting disorders, previous thrombosis, varicose veins with superficial vein thrombosis, exogenous hormones, malignancy, chemotherapy, infection, inflammation, pregnancy, obesity, smoking, and advancing age. It is estimated that hospitalized patients are 100 times more likely to develop VTE and, compared with surgical patients, medical patients often have more severe forms of VTE. VTE carries a significant risk of morbidity and mortality. Prophylactic strategies, including mechanical and pharmacological methods, are recommended for patients at risk of VTE. Pharmacological prophylaxis is considered the standard practice for acutely ill medical patients at risk of developing VTE in the absence of contraindications. For hospitalized patients, the risk of VTE extends beyond hospital stay and up to 90 days, with most events occurring within 45 days of discharge. Despite that, it remains unclear whether extended-duration anticoagulation for primary VTE prophylaxis would provide benefits without added risks or harm.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and risks of standard- versus extended-duration anticoagulation for primary VTE prophylaxis in acutely ill medical patients.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and Web of Science databases, as well as the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers up to 27 March 2023. We also searched reference lists of all included studies for additional references and searched the last five years of the American Society of Hematology conference proceedings.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing standard-duration versus extended-duration anticoagulation for primary VTE prophylaxis in acutely ill medical patients (adults being treated in a medical inpatient setting).

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methodological procedures set by Cochrane. At least two authors independently screened titles and abstracts for inclusion and performed data extraction. Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias (RoB) using the Cochrane RoB 2 tool. We analyzed outcomes data using the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome. Our outcomes of interest were assessed in the short term (during the treatment period and within 45 days of hospitalization) and long term (assessed beyond 45 days of hospitalization). Primary outcomes were symptomatic VTE, major bleeding, and all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes were total VTE, a composite of fatal and irreversible vascular events (including myocardial infarction, non-fatal PE, cardiopulmonary death, stroke), fatal bleeding, and VTE-related mortality.

Main Results

A total of seven RCTs fulfilled our inclusion criteria, comprising 40,846 participants. All studies contributing data to our outcomes were at low risk of bias in all domains. Most studies reported the outcomes in the short term. Extended-duration anticoagulation, compared with standard-duration anticoagulation, for primary VTE prophylaxis in acutely ill medical patients reduced the risk of short-term symptomatic VTE (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.78; standard-duration 12 per 1000, extended-duration 7 per 1000, 95% CI 6 to 10; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome [NNTB] 204, 95% CI 136 to 409; 4 studies, 24,773 participants; high-certainty evidence). This benefit, however, was offset by an increased risk of short-term major bleeding (RR 2.05, 95% CI 1.51 to 2.79; standard-duration 3 per 1000, extended duration 6 per 1000, 95% CI 5 to 8; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome [NNTH] 314, 95% CI 538 to 222; 7 studies, 40,374 participants; high-certainty evidence). Extended-duration anticoagulation, compared with standard-duration, results in little to no difference in short-term all-cause mortality (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.08; standard-duration 34 per 1000, extended-duration 33 per 1000, 95% CI 30 to 37; 5 studies, 38,080 participants; high-certainty evidence), reduced short-term total VTE (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.85; standard-duration 37 per 1000, extended duration 28 per 1000, 95% CI 25 to 32; NNTB 107, 95% CI 76 to 178; 5 studies, 33,819 participants; high-certainty evidence), and short-term composite of fatal and irreversible vascular events (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.91; standard-duration 41 per 1000, extended-duration 29 per 1000, 95% CI 23 to 37; NNTB 85, 95% CI 50 to 288; 1 study, 7513 participants; high-certainty evidence). Extended-duration anticoagulation may result in little to no difference in short-term fatal bleeding (RR 2.28, 95% CI 0.84 to 6.22; standard-duration 0 per 1000, extended-duration 0 per 1000, 95% CI 0 to 1; 7 studies, 40,374 participants; low-certainty evidence), and likely results in little to no difference in short-term VTE-related mortality (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.05; standard-duration 5 per 1000, extended-duration 4 per 1000 95% CI 3 to 6; 6 studies, 36,170 participants; moderate-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

In the short term, extended- versus standard-duration anticoagulation for primary VTE prophylaxis in acutely ill medical patients reduced the risk of symptomatic VTE at the expense of an increased risk of major bleeding. Extended-duration anticoagulation resulted in little to no difference in all-cause mortality. Extended-duration anticoagulation reduced the risk of total VTE and the composite of fatal and irreversible vascular events, but may show little to no difference in fatal bleeding and VTE-related mortality. Further data, with longer follow-up, are needed to determine the optimal agent and duration for primary VTE prophylaxis in acutely ill medical patients.

Session 4: Guideline for prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism (VTE) (deep vein thrombosis (DVT)) in immobile patients with AIS

Chair: G. A Ford (Oxford), Secretary: M. Lantz (Stockholm), Speakers: V. Caso (Perugia), C. Sjöstrand (Stockholm)
To endorse the proposed guideline on prophylaxis for VTE in immobile patients with AIS as follows: We recommend that graduated compression stockings should not be used in patients with ischaemic stroke (Grade A). We recommend that intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC, thigh-length, sequential) should be used for immobile patients with ischaemic stroke. It should not be used in patients with open wounds on the legs and should be used with caution in those with existing DVT, heart failure, severe peripheral vascular disease or confusion (Grade A). To consider prophylactic anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin (UFH), LMWH or heparinoid in immobile patients with ischaemic stroke in whom the benefits of reducing the risk of VTE is high enough to offset the increased risks of intracranial and extracranial bleeding associated with their use (Grade A). Where prophylactic anticoagulation is indicated LMWH or heparinoid should be considered instead of UFH because of its greater reduction in risk of DVT, the greater convenience, reduced staff costs and patient comfort. These advantages should be weighed against the higher risk of extracranial bleeding, higher drug costs and risks in elderly patients with poor renal function (Grade A).
To ask the ESO to consider the following remarks in relation to the new guidelines: IPC should be used for 30 days or until the patient is mobilizing independently. IPC should not be commenced if more than 72 h post stroke, unless pre-existing DVT has been ruled out. Prophylactic anticoagulation should be used if IPC is not tolerated. Treatment should be used for 30 days or until mobilized. Prophylactic anticoagulation may be used in combination with IPC in patients with high risk of VTE (e.g. active cancer, coagulation disorder or previous DVT). If prophylactic anticoagulation with LMWH is used, standard prophylaxis doses should be applied. For Enoxaprin subcutaneous injection of 40 mg once daily (20 mg if creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min) and for Dalteparin subcutaneous injection of 5000 IE once daily (2500 IE if creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min). The risk for bleeding should be assessed before VTE prophylaxis is administered. Research is needed to validate a risk assessment tool to evaluate bleeding risk in patients with ischaemic stroke. In patients with poor renal function (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min), or at higher risk for extracranial bleeding (e.g. recent GI bleeding, known gastric ulceration), UFH can be considered before LMWH. In other clinical settings, non-vitamin K oral antagonists (NOACs) have been shown to be effective for prophylactic treatment of VTE prophylaxis. Further research is warranted to investigate if NOAC may be an option for prophylaxis of VTE in patients with ischaemic stroke.

Treatment

Therapeutic anticoagulation is the cornerstone of VTE treatment. Drug selection requires specific considerations, such as renal or hepatic dysfunction, thrombocytopenia, and gastrointestinal tract function. The choice of drug may change by function of the patient's clinical condition and clinical care setting. In the in‐hospital setting, parental drugs are preferred on the basis of their pharmacological advantages (Table 3). Patients taking therapeutic‐dose DOACs or vitamin K antagonists should consider switching to LMWH. Use of LMWH may be preferred in an in‐patient setting, whereas DOACs may be preferred in an outpatient setting. However, in patients who may need invasive procedures, UFH may be an optimal option because of the shorter half‐life. Finally, the complete duration of treatment of the VTE event should be ≥ 3 months. 93

In patients with severe PE, the routine use of inferior vena cava filters is not recommended, although their placement may be considered in selected cases, such as recurrent PE, despite optimal anticoagulation, or clinically significant VTE in the setting of absolute contraindications to anticoagulation. 114 Guideline recommendations should be followed for reperfusion strategies in patients with acute PE. 115 Hemodynamically stable patients should be given anticoagulation. However, patients with hemodynamic instability should be managed with systemic fibrinolysis or with catheter‐directed options as an alternative if not suited for systemic fibrinolysis. Most patients with DVT can be managed with anticoagulation. However, only patients with phlegmasia or with truly refractory symptoms may benefit from endovascular techniques.

Extended Prophylaxis

There are no specific data on extended postdischarge prophylaxis in patients with COVID‐19 postdischarge. 8 A postdischarge follow‐up study did not find a higher risk of postdischarge VTE in patients with COVID‐19 when compared with patients with other acute medical illness. 116 Therefore, routine use of extended prophylaxis is not recommended. However, patients at high risk of postdischarge VTE (Table 3) and low bleeding risk may consider extended prophylaxis (≥ 14 days and up to 30 days) with either LMWH or DOACs. 93

### Prophylaxis of venous thrombosis in neurocritical care patients: an evidence-based guideline: a statement for healthcare professionals from the Neurocritical Care Society [^112MjDEm]. Neurocritical Care (2016). Medium credibility.

Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) — venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk, prophylaxis effects, and on-page recommendations are as follows: symptomatic deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in ICH is reported at 1–2% in retrospective studies and 5% in a placebo arm, with ultrasonography-detected DVT 20–40% and clinically evident pulmonary embolism (PE) approximately 0.5–2%, and the risk of VTE is 2–4 times as high as in acute ischemic stroke. A meta-analysis found that unfractionated heparin (UFH) or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) prophylaxis reduced PE (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.17–0.80, p = 0.01), and guideline synthesis reported reduced symptomatic DVT (RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.21–0.42) and PE (RR 0.7, 95% CI 0.47–1.03) with no effect on hematoma expansion (RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.05–1.13) or mortality (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.46–2.36). Recommendations: We recommend the use of IPC and/or GCS for VTE prophylaxis over no prophylaxis beginning at the time of hospital admission. (Strong recommendation and high-quality evidence) We suggest using prophylactic doses of subcutaneous UFH or LMWH to prevent VTE in patients with stable hematomas and no ongoing coagulopathy beginning within 48 h of hospital admission. (Weak recommendation and low-quality evidence) We suggest continuing mechanical VTE prophylaxis with IPCs in patients started on pharmacologic prophylaxis.

Interpretation of strong and conditional recommendations — Strong recommendation: For patients, "most individuals in this situation would want the recommended course of action, and only a small proportion would not". For clinicians, "most individuals should follow the recommended course of action. Formal decision aids are not likely to be needed to help individual patients make decisions consistent with their values and preferences". For policy makers, "the recommendation can be adopted as policy in most situations. Adherence to this recommendation according to the guideline could be used as a quality criterion or performance indicator". For researchers, "the recommendation is supported by credible research or other convincing judgments that make additional research unlikely to alter the recommendation. On occasion, a strong recommendation is based on low or very low certainty in the evidence. In such instances, further research may provide important information that alters the recommendations". Conditional recommendation: For patients, "the majority of individuals in this situation would want the suggested course of action, but many would not. Decision aids may be useful in helping patients to make decisions consistent with their individual risks, values, and preferences". For clinicians, "recognize that different choices will be appropriate for individual patients and that you must help each patient arrive at a management decision consistent with their values and preferences. Decision aids may be useful in helping individuals to make decisions consistent with their individual risks, values, and preferences". For policy makers, "policy making will require substantial debate and involvement of various stakeholders. Performance measures about the suggested course of action should focus on whether an appropriate decision-making process is duly documented". For researchers, "this recommendation is likely to be strengthened (for future updates or adaptation) by additional research. An evaluation of the conditions and criteria (and the related judgments, research evidence, and additional considerations) that determined the conditional (rather than strong) recommendation will help to identify possible research gaps".

70During the 100-day dalteparin treatment period, the addition of dalteparin reduced the risk of VTE from 23% to 3. 4%. Severe hemorrhagic complications occurred in 3. 2% of patients treated with gemcitabine alone and
3. 4% of patients treated with gemcitabine plus dalteparin. P = 0.001). Risk of a major bleed in the first 3 months was 3. 4% without enoxaparin and
4. 5% with enoxaparin. 72Both of these trials used higher-than-standard prophylactic dosing: dalteparin 200 IU/kg once daily for 4 weeks followed by a stepdown to 150 IU/kg for a further 8 weeks in FRAGEM. For long-term anticoagulation, LMWH, edoxaban, or rivaroxaban for at least 6 months are preferred because of improved efficacy over vitamin K antagonists. VKAs are inferior, but may be used if LMWH or DOACs are not accessible. There is an increase in major bleeding risk with DOACs, particularly observed in GI and potentially genitourinary malignancies.

Anticoagulation with LMWH, DOACs, or VKAs beyond the initial 6 months should be offered to select patients with active cancer, such as those with metastatic disease or those receiving chemotherapy. Anticoagulation beyond 6 months needs to be assessed on an intermittent basis to ensure a continued favorable risk-benefit profile. * Recommendation 4. 3*. 25of the trials by Raskob 39and Young, 43DOACs were associated with a numerically lower risk of VTE but a higher risk of major bleeding compared with LMWH. There was no significant difference in mortality.

Venous thromboembolism (deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, VTE) is a common complication in surgical patients and is the primary cause of preventable deaths in hospitalized patients. Despite well-known risk factors, VTE prophylaxis is frequently not practiced according to recommended guidelines. Patients can readily be stratified according to their risk of perioperative VTE, and mechanical and pharmacologic prophylactic regimens can be tailored to their individual risk. Pharmacologic VTEprophylaxis should be the standard of care in most clinical settings given its ease of administration, low risk, and cost-effectiveness.

### How I manage venous thromboembolism risk in hospitalized medical patients [^112prWsG]. Blood (2012). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism is a significant cause of illness and death worldwide. Large bodies of evidence support the heightened risk status of hospitalized medical patients, and that prophylactic measures significantly reduce the risk of thrombosis, yet these patients often fail to receive adequate prophylactic therapy. This failure may be accounted for by a lack of awareness of the relevant indications, poorly designed implementation systems, and clinical concerns over the side effects of anticoagulant medications. This article briefly summarizes our understanding of the clinical factors relevant to the evaluation of venous thromboembolism risk in hospitalized medical patients. We describe our approach to the use of thromboprophylaxis, through which we aim to minimize the disease burden of this under-recognized and preventable pathology.

### Long COVID-ACOEM guidance statement [^116oHaF6]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Long COVID thromboembolic disorders — risk persistence, anticoagulation guidance, and work restrictions are highlighted as follows: SARS-CoV-2 infection induces a prothrombotic state and the incidence of arterial thrombosis and venous thromboembolic events after the diagnosis of COVID-19 are relatively high soon after COVID-19 diagnosis, and the risk for venous thromboembolic events remains elevated for at least 49 weeks after the COVID-19 diagnosis, with this prolonged increase primarily seen in hospitalized patients. The NIH Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 recommends against routinely prescribing venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis for nonhospitalized patients with COVID-19 or continuing VTE prophylaxis in patients with COVID-19 after hospital discharge unless there is another indication for anticoagulation; it is possible that selected high-risk patients who have a low risk of bleeding may benefit from postdischarge anticoagulation if they have a history of VTE, peak D-dimer level greater than 3 µg/mL, and pre-discharge C-reactive protein level greater than 10 mg/dL. For workplace safety, workers on anticoagulants should avoid tasks that can potentially increase the risk of bleeding and substitution of jobs or tasks is recommended; for workers with deep vein thrombosis, prolonged sitting should be avoided, and adequate hydration should be maintained.

Pharmacologic prophylaxis must be initiated as soon as possible and for most trauma patients may be initiated within 24 hours.

When high VTE risk trauma patients who receive enoxaparin within 24 hours of admission are compared with those who receive only mechanical prophylaxis, minor and major bleeding events do not differ. As detailed in section E, appropriate delays may occur in the initiation of pharmacologic prophylaxis because of active bleeding, coagulopathy, hemodynamic instability, solid organ injury, TBI, or spinal trauma. In most cases, pharmacologic prophylaxis may be started in less than 24 hours, and in almost every case, pharmacologic prophylaxis may be started in less than 72 hours.

Pharmacologic prophylaxis is often held because of pending surgery despite the evidence that it may be initiated before most surgical procedures.– Trauma patients who require an operation are unique in that their first operation may occur within minutes of arrival or days into the hospitalization. Increasingly, pharmacologic prophylaxis is delayed or skipped for pending surgery, which leads to an increased VTE rate. Preoperative dosing of pharmacologic prophylaxis is not unique to trauma. In other patient populations at high risk for VTE, the use of preoperative pharmacologic prophylaxis decreased the DVT rate without increasing the complication rate. Guidelines for perioperative care in gynecologic/oncology recommend, "Prophylaxis should be initiated pre-operatively and continued post-operatively". Patients who underwent elective hip surgery who received low molecular weight heparin approximately 6 hours before surgery had a lower rate of proximal DVT without increasing major, minor, or trivial bleeding rates. This benefit was not observed when low molecular weight heparin was provided 12 hours or more preoperatively. We believe that the common and somewhat reflexive process of withholding pharmacologic prophylaxis for 12 to 24 hours before planned surgical procedures is almost always unnecessary and will result in an increased VTE risk without an accompanying decrease in the risk of bleeding events.

### Management of bleeding risk in patients who receive anticoagulant therapy for venous thromboembolism: communication from the ISTH SSC subcommittee on predictive and diagnostic variables in thrombotic disease [^1177gLw3]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Venous thromboembolism (VTE), including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), represents a common cardiovascular disease, affecting 1–2 per 1000 individuals per year worldwide. Timely diagnosis and initiation of anticoagulant treatment is critical as historical studies have reported mortality rates up to 30% when acute VTE is left untreated. To prevent thrombus progression and early recurrences once a diagnosis of VTE is established, anticoagulant treatment begins with an initiation phase that lasts for 5–21 days, depending on the anticoagulant regimen selected, and is continued for at least 3 months (i.e. the treatment phase). After completion of the treatment phase, the decision to continue anticoagulation is driven mainly by the estimated risk of recurrent VTE. Current guidelines advise to consider continuation of anticoagulant therapy among patients with major persistent risk factors (e.g. cancer or antiphospholipid syndrome) or when VTE occurs in the absence of transient risk factors (i.e. unprovoked VTE).

Although anticoagulant therapy is highly effective at reducing the risk of recurrent VTE, this comes at the expense of an increased risk of bleeding complications. The risk of major bleeding is greatest during the initial 3 months of treatment with an estimated incidence of 2%, and a case fatality rate of 11.3%, comparable to the case fatality rate of recurrent VTE. For patients who receive anticoagulant drugs for more than 3 months, the reported risk of major bleeding is 1.3–2.2 per 100 patient‐years (reaching a 5‐year cumulative risk of 6.3%) with a case fatality rate of 5.1%–12% in patients treated with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). This risk is considerably lower when patients are treated with a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) approximating 0.72–1.6 events/100 patient years, while evidence on cumulative risks beyond 24 months are still sparse. These numbers highlight the importance of harm‐to‐benefit assessment of long‐term anticoagulant treatment, for which the risk of VTE recurrence is weighed against the risk of bleeding. In addition, identification of potentially modifiable bleeding predictors may provide physicians tools to diminish an individual patient's bleeding risk during follow‐up.

Summary of recommendations

Recommendation 1b

The ASH guideline panel suggests using prophylactic-intensity over therapeutic-intensity anticoagulation for patients with COVID-19–related critical illness who do not have suspected or confirmed venous thromboembolism (VTE; conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence about effects ⨁◯◯◯).

Remarks:

- Patients with COVID-19–related critical illness are defined as those suffering from an immediately life-threatening condition who would typically be admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU). Examples include patients requiring hemodynamic support, ventilatory support, and renal replacement therapy.
- A separate recommendation (1a) addresses the comparison of intermediate-intensity and prophylactic-intensity anticoagulation in critically ill patients with COVID-19.
- An individualized assessment of the patient's risk of thrombosis and bleeding is important when deciding on anticoagulation intensity. Risk assessment models to estimate thrombotic risk have been validated in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (critically or noncritically ill), with modest prognostic performance. No risk assessment models for bleeding have been validated for patients with COVID-19. The panel acknowledges that higher-intensity anticoagulation may be preferred for patients judged to be at low bleeding risk and high thrombotic risk.
- At present, there is no direct high-certainty evidence comparing different types of anticoagulants for patients with COVID-19. Unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin was used in the identified studies.
- This recommendation does not apply to patients who require anticoagulation to prevent thrombosis of extracorporeal circuits such as those on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or continuous renal replacement therapy.

### Deep vein thrombosis [^113HV8JU]. Lancet (2005). Excellent credibility.

Deep vein thrombosis and its sequelae pulmonary embolism and post-thrombotic syndrome are some of the most common disorders. A thrombus either arises spontaneously or is caused by clinical conditions including surgery, trauma, or prolonged bed rest. In these instances, prophylaxis with low-dose anticoagulation is effective. Diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis relies on imaging techniques such as ultrasonography or venography. Only about 25% of symptomatic patients have a thrombus. Thus, clinical risk assessment and D-dimer measurement are used to rule out deep vein thrombosis. Thrombus progression and embolisation can be prevented by low-molecular-weight heparin followed by vitamin K antagonists. Use of these antagonists for 3–6 months is sufficient for many patients. Those with antithrombin deficiency, the lupus anticoagulant, homozygous or combined defects, or with previous deep vein thrombosis can benefit from indefinite anticoagulation. In cancer patients, low-molecular-weight heparin is more effective than and is at least as safe as vitamin K antagonists. Women seem to have a lower thrombosis risk than men, but pregnancy or use of oral contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy represent important risk factors.

Multiple myeloma — management of venous thromboembolism (VTE) general principles: The highest risk for VTE is in the first 6 months following new diagnosis of MM, and VTE prophylaxis is administered assuming there are no contraindications to anticoagulation agents or anti-platelets. All anticoagulants carry increased risk of bleeding; careful consideration needs to be made regarding risks and benefits for each patient, and warfarin at international normalized ratio (INR) 2–3 is not directly comparable to the other agents listed at prophylactic doses with respect to bleeding and thrombotic risks. Patients already on therapeutic anticoagulants for other reasons (eg, atrial fibrillation) should continue anticoagulation therapy. If no other coagulopathy, full-dose anticoagulation is contraindicated in concomitant thrombocytopenia < 50,000/μL; in patients with high risk for VTE, prophylactic anticoagulation may be appropriate even if platelet count is as low as 25,000/μL. Indications for long-term anticoagulation include unprovoked VTE or provoked VTE in the presence of a risk factor that is still present. For any patients who develop VTE on IMiD-based therapy, continue using therapeutic dose anticoagulants for as long as IMiD-based therapy is indicated. Note: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

Necessity of anticoagulation at discharge

The CDC and ACF recommend against the routine use of prophylactic anticoagulation for patients discharged from the hospital. However, the CDC and ACF as well as ASH and SCC-ISTH mention that FDA-approved post-discharge prophylactic anticoagulation (PDPA) regimens (rivaroxaban and betrixaban) may be considered in patients with high risk for VTE and low risk for bleeding. Similarly, the ACCP mentions that PDPA can be considered in patients who are at low risk of bleeding if emerging data suggests that the risk of VTE outweighs the risk of bleeding. The ACF and SCC-ISTH both mention that enoxaparin in addition to betrixaban or rivaroxaban can be considered if PDPA is thought to be reasonable. The duration of anticoagulation recommended by ACF is based on the timing used in clinical trials which is 31–39 days for rivaroxaban, 35–42 days for betrixaban, and 6–14 days for enoxaparin. The SCC-ISTH recommends a duration of a minimum of 14 days and up to 30 days. ACC mentions that it is reasonable to consider extended prophylaxis with LMWH or DOACs for up to 45 days in patients at high risk for VTE (i.e. D-dimer > 2 times ULN, reduced mobility, active cancer) and low risk of bleeding. As an alternative, ASH mentions that aspirin can also be considered based on studies for VTE prophylaxis in low risk patients after orthopedic surgery. Aspirin is not mentioned in any of the other guidelines and recommendations with the exception of SCC-ISTH which reports that none of their respondents recommended aspirin for post-discharge thromboprophylaxis.

ASH 2019 VTE prevention in surgical patients — pharmacological versus mechanical prophylaxis: In patients undergoing major surgery, there may be no difference in mortality between pharmacological and mechanical prophylaxis (relative risk [RR], 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.46–1.84; low certainty in the evidence of effects) and there may be no difference for symptomatic pulmonary embolism (PE) (RR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.36–2.96; low certainty in the evidence of effects), with likely little or no difference in symptomatic proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (RR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.41–1.32; moderate certainty in the evidence of effects). Pharmacological prophylaxis likely reduces symptomatic distal DVT risk (RR, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.05–0.58; moderate certainty in the evidence of effects) but probably results in a small absolute increase of major bleeding (RR, 2.01; 95% CI, 0.29–14.05; low certainty in the evidence of effects). The panel determined that, on balance, neither approach was favored over the other for patients at low or moderate bleeding risk, and for patients at high baseline risk for major bleeding, mechanical prophylaxis would more clearly be favored because of the incremental risk of bleeding with pharmacological prophylaxis.

### Trends in venous thromboembolism anticoagulation in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 [^115LMtQV]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Given the concern about VTE risk for patients hospitalized with COVID-19, national and international efforts have strongly emphasized the need for universal use and administration of VTE pharmacologic prophylaxis. In our study, 12.0% of patients received no anticoagulation — potentially because they were considered low risk or had contraindications to treatment. Given what we know about coagulopathy in COVID-19 and growing evidence that anticoagulation may help hospitalized non-ICU patients the most, it is possible that even patients who seem low risk may benefit from anticoagulation. We also found evidence that adherence may be associated with 60-day mortality; prior studies have shown that missed doses of VTE prophylaxis are common and associated with higher VTE rates. Interestingly, the COVID-19 pandemic and focus on VTE prevention may represent one of the most effective implementation efforts of an evidence-based practice. In our multicenter cohort, the average number of patients with 2 or more days of missed prophylaxis medication declined from over 50% to less than 10% over just 3 months. Investigating how that implementation and dissemination effort can be replicated outside of a pandemic warrants further investigation.

Our findings have important implications. First, more data from randomized trials are needed on long-term outcomes of treatment-dose anticoagulation in patients without a confirmed VTE diagnosis. Second, VTE prophylaxis in patients with COVID-19 is standard of care. Hospitals should implement processes to ensure use of VTE prophylaxis for hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Finally, the variable and increasing use of treatment-dose anticoagulation raises concerns especially given the lack of an association with 60-day mortality. We need better methods to risk stratify and diagnose patients with VTE and a stronger evidence-base on which to decide when to employ prophylactic vs therapeutic doses of anticoagulation for patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Participation in ongoing clinical trials will help identify whether any patient groups may benefit from therapeutic doses of anticoagulation. Otherwise, given the lack of mortality difference between groups, judicious therapeutic dosing may be necessary.

### Oral anticoagulants in the management of venous thromboembolism [^111AMGWg]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2013). Medium credibility.

Despite advances in diagnosis, prevention, and management, venous thromboembolism (VTE) remains a common cause of morbidity and mortality. For decades, antithrombotic therapy for prevention and treatment of VTE was limited to parenteral agents related to heparin and oral vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). Both classes of anticoagulants are effective, but have limitations, including considerable variability in dose-response, narrow therapeutic margins between the risks of thrombosis and bleeding, and the need to monitor anticoagulation intensity. Over the past decade, the introduction of new oral anticoagulants that specifically inhibit coagulation factors IIa (thrombin) or Xa has changed practice in a variety of clinical situations, including VTE prophylaxis and treatment. In this Review, we outline the use of the novel oral anticoagulants apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban in the prevention and treatment of VTE, and discuss practical considerations for choosing the appropriate drug for each patient. Although the introduction of novel anticoagulant drugs is promising, selecting the optimum strategy for an individual patient requires an understanding of the specific circumstances associated with thrombus formation and the pharmacological properties of each agent.

### Current treatment of venous thromboembolism [^113m9kd4]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2010). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism, comprising deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, is a common disorder with at least 250 000 new events occurring each year in the United States alone. Treatment of venous thromboembolism includes anticoagulation, which is achieved initially with the use of a parenterally administered agent followed by a more prolonged course of treatment with an oral vitamin K antagonist. The duration of treatment depends on the clinical assessment of the benefit-to-risk ratio of prolonged anticoagulation versus the risk of recurrent events. In this review, we discuss some of the issues that we believe are among the most critical unanswered questions in the management of venous thromboembolism in the present era.

Reevaluation of evidence — patient-important vs surrogate outcomes: Applying the ACCP-GRADE approach requires distinguishing patient-important from surrogate outcomes; for example, an intervention that increases serious bleeding by 20 events in 1,000 patients but reduces asymptomatic thrombosis by 100 in 1,000 leaves net benefit unclear without knowing the symptomatic DVT and pulmonary embolism reductions. The authors highlight the need for studies that directly measure symptomatic thrombosis without venographic or ultrasound surveillance.

What is new in these ASH guidelines?

The contribution of these guidelines in the broader space of treatment and prevention of VTE is to ensure that a patient-centered, individualized approach is adopted whenever appropriate. Although establishing unbiased estimates of the effect of specific antithrombotic treatments requires large RCTs, the same trials often do not provide sufficiently granular evidence to optimize the choice of whom to treat. Ultimately, the goal is to reduce the number needed to treat as much as possible, thus avoiding treatment of those patients who will not benefit from treatment or denying treatment to those who will.

To accomplish this overarching goal of finding out whether thrombophilia testing could lead to better individualized treatment, we believe the value of testing is to drive subsequent treatment decisions. We have devised an approach to appraise the value of thrombophilia testing built on combining prevalence data (how likely it is for an individual to have thrombophilia), risk association data (how likely it is for an individual with or without thrombophilia to have an event), and measures of treatment effect (how many fewer VTEs and how many more bleeding events will result from treating patients with thrombophilia and not treating patients without thrombophilia). Thus, what our panel decided upon was the number of events prevented (or provoked) by adopting a personalized treatment approach for the patients with a positive result for thrombophilia in several clinical scenarios. Of note, we have included cost, feasibility, acceptability, and equity considerations in the process. We argue that this is the best approach to making an evidence-based decision on the appropriateness of thrombophilia testing until robust prospective observations (and maybe RCTs) confirm or contradict the results of our simulations.

### Evidence-based therapies for pharmacologic prevention and treatment of acute deep vein thrombosis and Pulmonary embolism [^115AssJa]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) remains a significant mortal and morbid disease. The major risks have not changed and many patients present with unprovoked VTE disease. Prevention of VTE in hospitalized patients depends on comprehensive risk factor assessment, with an individual risk score. Proper and timely prophylaxis with mechanical, pharmacologic, or both is then effective. Treatment of VTE with parenteral anticoagulation followed by either a direct oral anticoagulant or warfarin is standard to reduce risk of VTE recurrence and death. Selected cases of iliofemoral deep vein thrombosis may be treated by pharmacomechanical thrombolysis, but more data are needed before this is standard of care.

### Patient preferences regarding pharmacologic venous thromboembolism prophylaxis [^112fSCnh]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The 2012 American College of Chest Physicians venous thromboembolism prevention guidelines emphasized the importance of considering patient preferences when ordering venous thromboembolism prophylaxis.

Objective

Determine patient preferences regarding pharmacologic venous thromboembolism prophylaxis.

Design

Single-center, mixed-methods survey.

Setting

Academic medical center.

Patients

Consecutive hospitalized patients on surgical and medical units.

Measurements

Patients were asked about their preferences regarding the route of administration for pharmacologic venous thromboembolism prophylaxis and the rationale for their preference. Qualitative analyses of themes were determined from patient rationale.

Results

Of the 227 patients, a majority (60.4%) preferred an oral medication, if equally effective to subcutaneous options. Dislike of needles (30.0%) and pain from injection (27.7%) were identified as rationales for their preference. Patients favoring subcutaneous administration (27.5%) identified a presumed faster onset of action (40.3%) as the primary reason for their preference. Patients with a preference for subcutaneous injections were less likely to refuse prophylaxis than patients who preferred an oral route of administration (37.5% vs 51.3%, P < 0.0001).

Limitation

Only medical and surgical patients participated.

Conclusion

In a sample of consecutive medical and surgical patients, a majority preferred an oral route of administration for prophylaxis. Patients preferring subcutaneous injections were less likely to refuse doses of ordered pharmacologic prophylaxis. These results indicate use of an oral agent for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis may improve adherence and that integrating patient preferences into care may increase delivery of effective prophylaxis and reduce the incidence of venous thromboembolism.

Venous Thromboprophylaxis Summary

Choosing the appropriate method of prophylaxis for your patient requires a thorough knowledge of the available agents, specifically their efficacy and risk profiles. There are many guidelines published (Table 1), and the ACCP provides a thorough review based on efficacy and risk. The ACCP continues to suggest tinzaparin over other agents based on its long-term risk data; however, many studies have shown direct factor Xa inhibitors such as rivaroxaban to have an equivalent or greater reduction in symptomatic VTE rates, with a similar risk profile. The use of aspirin has become increasingly popular, with numerous studies suggesting a similar efficacy in VTE prevention compared with anticoagulants, along with a favorable risk profile. However, the use of aspirin for VTE prophylaxis does still remain controversial, and although its use is supported by several guidelines, others recommend against it, and additional investigation would be beneficial before making firm conclusions. The ACCP recommends consideration be given to extend prophylaxis up to 35 days, rather than only 10 to 14 days, and the Thrombosis Canada guidelines also recommend a duration of 14 to 35 days with a longer duration for those patients at higher risk. Based on ACCP guidelines, dual prophylaxis with the addition of IPCDs while in hospital should be done.

### American Society of Hematology living guidelines on the use of anticoagulation for thromboprophylaxis in patients with COVID-19: may 2021 update on the use of intermediate-intensity anticoagulation in critically ill patients [^112ZRj2U]. Blood Advances (2021). Medium credibility.

Summary of recommendations

Recommendation 1a

The American Society of Hematology (ASH) guideline panel suggests using prophylactic-intensity over intermediate-intensity anticoagulation in patients with COVID-19–related critical illness who do not have suspected or confirmed venous thromboembolism (VTE) (conditional recommendation based on low certainty in the evidence about effects ⨁⨁◯◯).

Remarks:
The ASH guideline panel plans to continue to update this recommendation when the full results of other trials become available. Clinicians should weigh the benefits and harms based on the most up-to-date evidence in caring for their patients.
A now-expired recommendation published on 27 October 2020 compared therapeutic-intensity or intermediate-intensity with prophylactic-intensity anticoagulation in patients with COVID-19–related critical illness. With the emergence of new evidence, this recommendation has now been split into 2 recommendations: a recommendation comparing intermediate-intensity with prophylactic-intensity anticoagulation (Recommendation 1a) and a separate recommendation comparing therapeutic-intensity with prophylactic-intensity anticoagulation (Recommendation 1b), whereby the latter remains unchanged for now, but, as with other recommendations in this guideline, is subject to review and revision as new evidence becomes available that meets prespecified criteria for updating.
Patients with COVID-19–related critical illness are defined as those suffering from an immediately life-threatening condition who would typically be admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU). Examples include patients requiring hemodynamic support, ventilatory support, and renal replacement therapy.
An individualized assessment of the patient's risk of thrombosis and bleeding is important when deciding on anticoagulation intensity. Risk assessment models to estimate thrombotic and bleeding risk in hospitalized patients are available, but they have not been prospectively validated in patients with COVID-19.
At present, there is no direct high-certainty evidence comparing different types of anticoagulants. The selection of a specific agent (eg, low molecular weight heparin [LMWH], unfractionated heparin [UFH]) may be based on availability, resources required, familiarity, and the aim of minimizing the use of personal protective equipment or exposure of staff to COVID-19–infected patients as well as patient-specific factors (eg, renal function, history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, concerns about gastrointestinal tract absorption).
This recommendation does not apply to patients who require anticoagulation to prevent thrombosis of extracorporeal circuits such as those on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or continuous renal replacement therapy.

### Warfarin sodium (Coumadin) [^114mnCwu]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

2.1 Individualized Dosing

The dosage and administration of COUMADIN must be individualized for each patient according to the patient's INR response to the drug. Adjust the dose based on the patient's INR and the condition being treated. Consult the latest evidence-based clinical practice guidelines from the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) to assist in the determination of the duration and intensity of anticoagulation with COUMADIN [see References (15)].

2.2 Recommended Target INR Ranges and Durations for Individual Indications

An INR of greater than 4.0 appears to provide no additional therapeutic benefit in most patients and is associated with a higher risk of bleeding.

Venous Thromboembolism (including deep venous thrombosis [DVT] and PE)

Adjust the warfarin dose to maintain a target INR of 2.5 (INR range, 2.0–3.0) for all treatment durations. The duration of treatment is based on the indication as follows:

For patients with a DVT or PE secondary to a transient (reversible) risk factor, treatment with warfarin for 3 months is recommended.
For patients with an unprovoked DVT or PE, treatment with warfarin is recommended for at least 3 months. After 3 months of therapy, evaluate the risk-benefit ratio of long-term treatment for the individual patient.
For patients with two episodes of unprovoked DVT or PE, long-term treatment with warfarin is recommended. For a patient receiving long-term anticoagulant treatment, periodically reassess the risk-benefit ratio of continuing such treatment in the individual patient.

### Treatment of venous thromboembolism [^113exRt7]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2005). Low credibility.

This review on the treatment of patients with venous thromboembolic disease consists of three sections. The first section describes the epidemiology, natural history and reasons for treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE), as well as a short overview on the evaluation of the use of antithrombotic agents and the spectrum of treatment options. In the second section, the evidence from clinical studies available to us in 2005 with the various treatment modalities is summarized. This section describes the current recommendations about how to treat patients with VTE initially and long term. Finally, in the third section the challenges for the treatment of patients beyond 2005 are discussed.

### American Society of Hematology 2021 guidelines on the use of anticoagulation for thromboprophylaxis in patients with COVID-19 [^116NRnro]. Blood Advances (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related critical illness and acute illness are associated with a risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE).

Objective

These evidence-based guidelines of the American Society of Hematology (ASH) are intended to support patients, clinicians, and other health care professionals in decisions about the use of anticoagulation for thromboprophylaxis for patients with COVID-19-related critical illness and acute illness who do not have confirmed or suspected VTE.

Methods

ASH formed a multidisciplinary guideline panel and applied strict management strategies to minimize potential bias from conflicts of interest. The panel included 3 patient representatives. The McMaster University GRADE Centre supported the guideline-development process, including performing systematic evidence reviews (up to 19 August 2020). The panel prioritized clinical questions and outcomes according to their importance for clinicians and patients. The panel used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, including GRADE Evidence-to-Decision frameworks, to assess evidence and make recommendations, which were subject to public comment.

Results

The panel agreed on 2 recommendations. The panel issued conditional recommendations in favor of prophylactic-intensity anticoagulation over intermediate-intensity or therapeutic-intensity anticoagulation for patients with COVID-19-related critical illness or acute illness who do not have confirmed or suspected VTE.

Conclusions

These recommendations were based on very low certainty in the evidence, underscoring the need for high-quality, randomized controlled trials comparing different intensities of anticoagulation. They will be updated using a living recommendation approach as new evidence becomes available.

### VTE prophylaxis for the medical patient: where do we stand?-a focus on cancer patients [^113mZyFL]. Thrombosis Research (2010). Low credibility.

Acutely ill medical patients are at moderate to high risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE): approximately 10–30% of general medical patients may develop deep-vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, and the latter is a leading contributor to deaths in hospital. Medical conditions associated with a high risk of VTE include cardiac disease, cancer, respiratory disease, inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatological and infectious diseases. Pre-disposing risk factors in medical patients include a history of VTE, history of malignancy, complicating infections, increasing age, thrombophilia, prolonged immobility and obesity. Hence active cancer and a history of cancer are both strongly related to VTE in medical (non-surgical) patients. Heparins, both unfractionated (UFH) and low molecular weight (LMWH) and fondaparinux have been shown to be effective agents in prevention of VTE in this setting. However, it has not yet been possible to demonstrate a significant effect on mortality rates in this population. In medical patients, unfractionated heparin has a higher rate of bleeding complications than low molecular weight heparin. Thromboprophylaxis has been shown to be effective in medical patients with cancer and may have an effect on cancer outcomes. Thromboprophylaxis in patients receiving chemotherapy remains controversial and requires further investigation. There is no evidence for the use of aspirin, warfarin or mechanical methods. We recommend either low molecular weight heparin or fondaparinux as safe and effective agents in the thromboprophylaxis of medical patients.

### Fundamental research in oncology and thrombosis 2 (FRONTLINE 2): a follow-up survey [^113nFSda]. The Oncologist (2020). Medium credibility.

Guidelines for the prophylaxis and treatment of VTE in patients with cancer such as those disseminated by the American Society of Clinical Oncology 13 and others 35, 36 recommend that VTE be managed similarly to that arising in individuals without cancer: anticoagulation using LMWH (especially in medical oncology)/UFH, VKA, or DOAC underlying the basis of therapy. Although guidelines are highly useful education materials backed by evidence mainly from clinical trials, their actual implementation is uncertain; in reality, patients with cancer are more likely treated individually. Moreover, "cancer" is a very broad term used to describe a great variety of solid tumors and malignant blood disorders of early and more advanced stages in elderly, not‐so‐elderly, and children treated with or without surgery (an independent risk factor for VTE), hospitalized to receive chemotherapy or at end of life, or outpatients managed in the community. Hence, real‐world data are important because they tell us what clinicians are indeed doing based on their perceptions and patients' preferences.

Combined analysis of data from the EINSTEIN‐DVT and EINSTEIN‐PE trials demonstrated similar efficacy between rivaroxaban and LMWH/VKA for secondary prophylaxis against VTE in patients with active cancer 24. The SELECT‐D randomized trial compared 6‐month treatment with rivaroxaban versus LMWH in patients with cancer and observed low rates of recurrence in either arm 37. Recent evidence from North America suggests that warfarin and rivaroxaban are at least as commonly used as prophylactic agent as LMWH, and for longer treatment periods 38. Moreover, a meta‐analysis of randomized controlled phase III trials suggested a trend, albeit nonsignificant, toward better efficacy and safety of DOACs versus VKA for the treatment of VTE in patients with cancer 39. Additionally, in a large‐scale study, antithrombotic prophylaxis significantly reduced systemic VTE and mortality in patients with cancer with a CVC implant 9. The HOKUSAI‐VTE trial showed that edoxaban was noninferior to conventional anticoagulation using warfarin in patients with cancer and VTE and led to less clinically relevant bleeding 25. Subsequently, the same investigators demonstrated noninferiority of edoxaban versus dalteparin at preventing VTE recurrence and major bleeding in a large cohort of patients with cancer 28. The present survey reveals that although warfarin is more commonly used prophylactically or therapeutically than any individual DOACs, use of these latter agents taken together as a class (that is, any DOAC) exceeds that of warfarin in contemporary practice.

### Antithrombotic therapy for VTE disease: second update of the CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^114bYgHm]. Chest (2021). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for deep vein thrombosis, more specifically with respect to choice of anticoagulation, initial management, provoked thrombosis, ACCP 2021 guidelines recommend to consider administering adjusted-dose VKAs (target INR 2.5, with an overlapping period of parenteral anticoagulation) rather than DOACs for the treatment phase in patients with confirmed antiphospholipid syndrome receiving anticoagulant therapy.
