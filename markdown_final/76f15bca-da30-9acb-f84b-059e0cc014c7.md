## Question

What is the age range for pyloric stenosis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the age range for pyloric stenosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the typical age of presentation for classic infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis. Then, I should verify how prematurity shifts chronological versus postmenstrual age at presentation. Next, I will examine the earliest and latest reported ages, including neonatal and late-onset cases. After that, I need to consider special populations like esophageal atresia and cystic fibrosis. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically useful age range and note diagnostic implications, especially for ultrasound thresholds in very young infants.

> Let me first confirm the classic infantile presentation window. Most infants with hypertrophic pyloric stenosis present between 3 and 12 weeks of life, with a peak around 4 to 6 weeks, and this 3–12 week frame is consistently cited in high-quality sources and reviews, including a BMJ cohort and a Pediatrics in Review summary, so I should anchor on that as the typical range [^2602ee26] [^707ab07b].

> Wait, let me verify how prematurity modifies this. Premature infants tend to present later by chronological age but earlier by postmenstrual age, often around 44–50 weeks PMA, which means a 6-week-old former 28-week infant might still be in the expected window when considering corrected age; large cohort data show preterm infants present at a median chronological age near 40 days versus about 33 days in term infants, reinforcing the need to think in both chronological and postmenstrual age when evaluating vomiting in preemies [^ab645044] [^6ae0d790].

> I will now examine the earliest presentations. Neonatal cases are uncommon but documented, with reports of confirmed HPS as early as 10–15 days of life; importantly, ultrasound diagnostic thresholds used for older infants may be too high in this group, and studies suggest using lower muscle thickness cutoffs (around 3.5 mm) to improve sensitivity in infants under 3 weeks, so I should flag that early disease may be underrecognized if standard adult-derived criteria are applied [^e3b0e14d] [^ff7769b3] [^d774da1e].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about the upper bound. Late-onset HPS beyond infancy is rare but reported, with case series and reports documenting presentations from 2 to 8 years and even into older childhood; these are often labeled primary acquired gastric outlet obstruction or late-onset HPS and may require different diagnostic and therapeutic approaches, so I should distinguish them from classic infantile HPS when giving a range [^8e44f60c] [^59275ac4] [^238acd12].

> But wait, what if the infant has esophageal atresia or other anomalies that mask symptoms. In esophageal atresia cohorts, HPS frequently presents later, often between 2 and 15 weeks with a median near 4–6 weeks, likely due to altered feeding and postoperative courses; this delayed recognition can push the apparent age range outward in special populations, so I need to keep a high index of suspicion in these infants even when they are older than the classic window [^28d85578] [^474863be] [^ef688ef4].

> Let me consider genetic associations that might shift presentation. Cystic fibrosis has been associated with a higher incidence of HPS, and syndromic patients can present across the usual infant window; while these do not fundamentally change the age range, they remind me to maintain vigilance in at-risk populations where the pretest probability is higher and symptoms may be attributed to other conditions [^4b508d94] [^f99516b4].

> I should double-check the practical clinical implications. For infants under 3 weeks, I need to adjust ultrasound thresholds and consider repeating imaging if clinical suspicion remains high, because early HPS can be subtle and misclassified as normal using standard 4 mm thickness cutoffs; conversely, in older infants and children with persistent nonbilious vomiting and failure to thrive, I should consider late-onset HPS or other causes of gastric outlet obstruction and tailor imaging accordingly [^e3b0e14d] [^8e44f60c] [^b3c083dd].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the final synthesis. The typical age range for classic infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis is 3 to 12 weeks of life, with a peak at 4 to 6 weeks; premature infants present later chronologically but earlier by postmenstrual age, roughly 44–50 weeks PMA; neonatal cases can occur as early as 10–15 days, requiring adjusted ultrasound criteria; and rare late-onset cases occur from early childhood up to about 8 years, representing a distinct entity from classic infantile HPS [^2602ee26] [^707ab07b] [^ab645044] [^e3b0e14d] [^8e44f60c].

The age range for pyloric stenosis is **typically 2 to 8 weeks** [^71ec74e9], with most cases presenting between 3 and 6 weeks of life [^707ab07b]. Early presentations can occur in **neonates under 21 days** [^e3b0e14d], especially in premature infants, who may present later chronologically but earlier by postmenstrual age [^ab645044] [^6ae0d790]. Late presentations beyond 12 weeks are rare but documented, including cases up to 8 years [^59275ac4] [^8e44f60c]. The median age at presentation is around 4 to 6 weeks, and diagnosis is often delayed in premature infants due to atypical features [^ab645044] [^6ae0d790].

---

## Typical age range

- **Typical onset**: 2 to 8 weeks of life [^71ec74e9], with a peak at 3 to 6 weeks [^707ab07b].
- **Median age**: 4 to 6 weeks [^notfound].
- **Clinical features**: Projectile, non-bilious vomiting, gastric hyperperistalsis, and a palpable "olive" in the right upper quadrant [^0466849b].

---

## Early presentation (neonatal period)

- **Early onset**: Cases within the first 21 days of life, including premature infants [^e3b0e14d].
- **Prematurity**: Preterm infants present later chronologically but earlier by postmenstrual age (44–50 weeks) [^ab645044] [^6ae0d790].
- **Diagnostic challenge**: Ultrasound criteria may need adjustment in neonates; muscle thickness < 4 mm can still indicate HPS [^e3b0e14d].

---

## Late presentation (beyond infancy)

- **Rare cases**: Documented presentations up to 8 years [^59275ac4] [^8e44f60c].
- **Clinical features**: Non-bilious vomiting, weight loss, and gastric outlet obstruction [^238acd12].
- **Management**: Surgical intervention (e.g. pyloromyotomy) remains effective [^59275ac4].

## Factors influencing age of presentation

Several factors influence the **age of presentation** of pyloric stenosis:

| **Factor** | **Influence on age of presentation** |
|-|-|
| Prematurity | Later chronological age, earlier postmenstrual age [^ab645044] [^6ae0d790] |
| Genetic predisposition | Earlier onset in certain populations (e.g. Caucasians) [^notfound] |
| Environmental factors | Seasonal variation and geographic differences [^531c6d10] |
| Diagnostic awareness | Earlier detection due to improved imaging and clinical awareness [^0c4c1f42] |

---

## Clinical implications of age range

- **Diagnostic approach**: Ultrasound is the gold standard [^4a7fdd48]; adjust thresholds in neonates [^e3b0e14d].
- **Perioperative care**: Emphasize preoperative stabilization and electrolyte correction [^363da669].
- **Prognosis**: Excellent with timely intervention; rare complications include incomplete pyloromyotomy or mucosal perforation [^0beebe5d].

---

The age range for pyloric stenosis is **primarily 2 to 8 weeks**, with most cases at 3 to 6 weeks; early neonatal and rare late childhood cases occur, and prematurity shifts presentation to a later chronological age but an earlier postmenstrual age.

### Evaluating infants with possible pyloric stenosis… [^0466849b]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis is a fairly common condition in infants, affecting approximately three of every 1, 000 live births. Clinical findings typically include a history of projectile, nonbilious vomiting, gastric hyperperistalsis and a palpable mass in the epigastric area. A palpable mass is sufficient cause for proceeding to surgical treatment without confirming diagnostic imaging studies. However, when physical findings alone are inconclusive, an upper gastrointestinal series and an abdominal ultrasound examination are often ordered because of their high sensitivity in identifying underlying problems. The upper gastrointestinal series is considered more cost-effective than ultrasound examination because patients with normal results on ultrasound examination still require additional testing to determine the cause of vomiting.

Mandell and associates studied infants with vomiting in an attempt to create an algorithm using the volumetric method for selecting the most appropriate imaging study to identify the cause of the vomiting. They also wished to better define the role of the pediatric surgeon in evaluating these infants. A pediatric radiologist inserted a no. 8 feeding tube into the patient's stomach and then aspirated and measured the gastric contents. An aspirated volume of at least 5 mL was considered consistent with gastric outlet obstruction or HPS, and an ultrasound examination was performed. An aspirated volume of less than 5 mL was not consistent with obstruction, so fluoroscopy was performed. HPS was defined on ultrasound examination as a 4-mm pyloric muscle thickness and a 14-mm pyloric muscle length. Pediatric surgeons obtained a history and examined most of the patients. A total of 89 patients were included in the study.

Of these, 23 were diagnosed with HPS based on the aspirate volume criteria and underwent surgery. The sensitivity of aspirate volume as an indicator was 91 percent. Two false-negative studies and eight false-positive studies occurred. More than one half of the patients with HPS had recently lost weight or failed to gain weight, compared with only 22 percent of those who did not have HPS. The mean duration of vomiting episodes was 19 days. Of the 66 patients evaluated with an upper gastrointestinal series, 52 had gastroesophageal reflux and nine had slow gastric emptying.

### Can you be too premature to develop pyloric stenosis? [^252768c2]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis of Pyloric stenosis is rare in preterm babies. A case of pyloric stenosis diagnosed at 33(+6) postmenstrual age is reported. To our knowledge, this is the youngest postmenstrual age in the literature for a preterm infant to have a confirmed diagnosis of pyloric stenosis. The report also discusses issues that could delay the diagnosis of this condition in this patient population.

### Prematurity affects age of presentation of pyloric stenosis [^ab645044]. Clinical Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Term infants with hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (HPS) typically present between 4 and 6 weeks. There is limited consensus, however, regarding age of presentation of premature infants. We aim to determine if there is an association between the degree of prematurity and chronological age of presentation of HPS. A total of 2988 infants who had undergone a pyloromyotomy for HPS were identified from the 2012 and 2013 NSQIP-P Participant Use Files. Two hundred seventeen infants (7.3%) were born prematurely. A greater degree of prematurity was associated with an older chronological age of presentation (P < .0001). Prematurity was significantly associated with an increase in overall postoperative morbidity, reintubation, readmission, and postoperative length of stay. When clinicians evaluate an infant with nonbilious emesis with a history of prematurity, they should consider pyloric stenosis if the calculated postconceptional age is between 44 and 50 weeks. When counseling families of premature infants, surgeons should discuss the increased incidence of postpyloromyotomy morbidity.

### Usual and unusual causes of pediatric gastric outlet obstruction [^db30f1a6]. Pediatric Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Gastric outlet obstruction in children encompasses a spectrum of disorders that extends beyond hypertrophic pyloric stenosis. Each condition can result in the clinical syndrome of persistent nonbilious vomiting, which can progress to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances. This paper reviews the spectrum of both the common and uncommon entities that cause partial or complete gastric outlet obstruction and their imaging appearances. The correct diagnosis of those with gastric outlet obstruction can be achieved by combining clinical presentation with appropriate imaging, leading to optimal and timely patient management.

### Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis [^707ab07b]. Pediatrics in Review (2021). Medium credibility.

Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis is a common condition seen in the first 1 to 3 months after birth. Patients typically present with nonbilious projectile emesis after feeds that may result in hypokalemic, hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis. Although inability to tolerate feeds is frequently seen with self-limited conditions such as reflux, a low threshold to obtain an ultrasonographic image is important to prevent a delay in diagnosis. Although operative intervention is the treatment, it is imperative that patients are hydrated and serum electrolyte concentrations normalized before the induction of anesthesia. Laparoscopic pyloromyotomy is safe and effective. Postoperative emesis is normal, and reassurance to parents is appropriate. There is no significant long-term physiologic impairment from pyloric stenosis after successful surgical intervention.

Download citation file: Pyloric stenosis is among of the most common conditions requiring surgery in infancy. It is characterized by abnormal thickening of the antropyloric muscles. The intervening lumen of the pyloric channel is obstructed, causing progressive vomiting that, in turn, results in dehydration. Management of PS consists of hydration and pyloromyotomy. PS was recognized as a clinical entity by Hezekiah Beardsley and Harald Hirschsprung in 1887. 1 The incidence of PS ranges from 1 to 3 per 1, 000 live births.

2 Early population-based studies reported a rise in the incidence of PS, 3, 4 but more recent reports indicate that.

Pyloric stenosis is a common pediatric surgical problem that requires a combination of both medical and surgical attention. This article reviews the classical elements necessary to care for the patient in a safe and effective manner. A well-tested management approach that can be applied to the general surgical environment is described. Perioperative management of the patient is discussed and the currently used techniques are reviewed. Current recommendations include the routine use of ultrasonography for diagnosis, attention to the preoperative correction of electrolytes, and the use of minimally invasive techniques for treatment.

Data extraction and analysis

We extracted demographic characteristics, timing of HPS diagnosis, clinical presentation, treatment, and outcomes from each included study. For descriptive synthesis, categorical variables were summarized as frequencies and percentages, while continuous variables were presented as median (interquartile range, IQR) and range. To illustrate overall survival, a descriptive Kaplan–Meier curve was generated by pooling institutional cases with those identified in the literature review.

### Negative exploration for pyloric stenosis – is it preventable? [^a1b516e0]. BMC Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Before the widespread introduction of US in 1977, the diagnosis of infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS) was made on the clinical finding of a palpable pyloric mass. An additional suggestive feature in the vomiting child is the characteristic biochemical picture of hypochloraemic hypokalaemic metabolic alkalosis. Although the decreasing incidence of these features (palpable mass and typical biochemical picture) have been attributed to earlier diagnosis and surgical referral, ultrasound evaluation is often obtained even before attempting a test feed in many infants. The reported diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound in IHPS is variable and operator dependent. This study aims to determine the incidence of negative exploration (NL) following a presumptive diagnosis of pyloric stenosis, and to identify factors leading to surgery.

### Delayed presentation of hypertrophic pyloric stenosis: a rare case [^208db937]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (HPS) is the most common cause of gastric outlet obstruction in infants, with an incidence of 1.5 to 3 per 1000 live births, and classically presents at 3 to 4 weeks of age. Delayed presentation of HPS is an extremely rare occurrence after early infancy. With the exclusion of congenital HPS, gastric outlet obstruction in childhood is a rare condition (1:100,000). We report a case of delayed presentation of HPS in a 4 1/2-year-old child in whom the pylorus was hypertrophied and appeared like an "olive", and for which pyloromyotomy was curative.

### Primary acquired gastric outlet obstruction in children: a retrospective single center study [^238acd12]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background/ Purpose

Idiopathic hypertrophic pyloric stenosis is by far the most common cause of gastric outlet obstruction (GOO) in young infants, with more than 90% of cases presenting between 3 and 10 weeks after birth. While cases of late onset pyloric stenosis beyond infancy have been reported, the etiology is poorly understood. We report our experience of 5 cases, describing the similarities and differences in management of our patient population which happens to be the second largest reported in literature.

Methods

From July 2014 to June 2018 (4 years) a total of five patients of primary acquired GOO were encountered at our center.

Results

The age range was 3 to 6 years and only one of them was a female. All presented with characteristic nonbilious vomiting that was recurrent and episodic. Upper GI (gastrointestinal) contrast study series revealed a dilated stomach and delayed gastric emptying. Upper GI endoscopy also demonstrated a dilated stomach without any intraluminal polyp, ulcer or any other pathology. Intraoperatively the pylorus had no evidence of scarring, inflammation, external compression or any mass in and around the pylorus. A retrocolic gastrojejunostomy was curative in all patients.

Conclusion

Though rare, one must maintain a high index of suspicion for primary acquired GOO in the differential diagnosis of older children with nonbilious vomiting and failure to thrive. Following appropriate diagnostic workup, surgical interventions should be performed expeditiously because adequate nutrition is key to proper physical and mental development of the child. Further research will hopefully elucidate the underlying pathophysiology in order to guide clinical options for both prevention and treatment.

### Negative exploration for pyloric stenosis – is it preventable? [^032a3583]. BMC Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Discussion and conclusion

The typical clinical diagnosis of IHPS is based on the finding of a palpable pyloric 'tumour' in an infant aged between 1 and 6 weeks with a history of vomiting and weight loss. "Projectile" vomiting is not discriminating, as this symptom may feature in any vomiting infant and is common in GOR. Traditionally, a positive test feed established the diagnosis. However, exclusive reliance on the test feed for diagnosis in pyloric stenosis is associated with false positive rates of 3–14% and false negative rates of 18–33%. The reported decline in the use of the test feed is supported by our finding that 39% of the infants in our study did not have the test. The reduced reliance on test feed for diagnosis inevitably diminishes clinical acumen for this mode of diagnosis. In our study, one of the patients in the NL group had a false positive test feed, after a positive ultrasound diagnosis from the referring hospital. The pyloric 'tumour' can be difficult to palpate in the early stages. Interestingly, the role of an element of 'suggestibility' has been reported previously, that if the examiner was aware of a positive US before doing a test feed, the success in palpating the pyloric 'tumour' increased to 46%, compared to the 26% when the examiner was unaware of the positive US.

### A crying baby: not simply infant colic [^61d5f844]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis is a relatively common condition, but atypical presentations can present a diagnostic challenge. We describe the case of a 9-week-old Latin male infant who presented with a 2-day history of intermittent crying and poor feeding. He was suspected to have intussusception but was affected by and successfully treated for hypertrophic pyloric stenosis. Diagnostic tools of atypical HPS cases are discussed.

### Esophageal atresia with concomitant hypertrophic pyloric stenosis: a case series and literature review [^28d85578]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Esophageal atresia (EA) with concomitant hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (HPS) is a rare condition, and its diagnosis can be challenging due to overlapping postoperative complications. Comprehensive clinical characterization remains limited.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed five patients with EA with concomitant HPS treated at our center between 2018 and 2025. A systematic literature search of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and CNKI identified 48 additional cases. Clinical features, timing of diagnosis, treatment strategies, and outcomes were analyzed.

Results

Among 132 neonates with EA in our institution, five (3.8%) developed HPS. Four had Gross type C EA, and three were male. All underwent EA repair in the first week of life and later developed HPS, diagnosed at a median age of 45 days (range: 20–145). All patients underwent laparoscopic pyloromyotomy with uneventful recovery and were alive at a median follow-up of 50 months. Literature review revealed 48 reported cases, predominantly male (41/48) and Gross type C (42/48). Combined analysis of 53 patients showed HPS onset typically between 2 and 15 weeks, with a median age of 4 weeks (IQR: 2.5–6 weeks). Overall survival was 90.6%, with deaths mainly due to infection or severe associated anomalies.

Conclusions

HPS may coexist with EA, with an incidence of approximately 3.8%. It often presents later in the disease course. Its diagnosis can be delayed by postoperative complications or altered feeding. Long-term follow-up and multicenter studies are warranted.

### Olive without a cause: the story of infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis [^425db99c]. Pediatric Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

For many diseases and medical conditions the clinical recognition and the development of accurate diagnostic methods and the etiological cause precede effective treatment. In the case of infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (HPS), this sequence of events did not happen. Clinical recognition of the entity proceeded directly to the development of curative treatment. Reliable diagnostic imaging methods followed, but a definitive etiology has not been elucidated. This paper reviews the historical aspects of hypertrophic pyloric stenosis, discusses how and why it took so long for this not uncommon disease to be recognized, and highlights the physicians who changed an often fatal disease into an easily diagnosed and treated minor affliction.

### Pyloric stenosis: a retrospective study of an Australian population… [^71ec74e9]. publications.aap.org (2008). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION: Infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis is a common cause of nonbilious vomiting in infants. The "classic" presentation is one of a firstborn boy who is aged 2 to 8 weeks and has projectile vomiting; palpable olive, visible peristalsis; and hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis. With increased awareness of the condition and readily available ultrasonographic diagnosis, classic presentations may be becoming less common. OBJECTIVE: We sought to describe the epidemiology, clinical features, and outcomes of children with IHPS at our institution. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective case review of all cases of IHPS that presented to our tertiary pediatric hospital in an 11-year period. RESULTS: The inclusion criteria were met by 330 children with confirmed IHPS. A total of 84% of patients were male, and 19% were born preterm. Preterm infants tend to present later, reflecting postmenstrual age.

The median age at presentation was 36 days with mean symptom duration of 11 days. Whereas 87% of patients had at least 1 classic finding on history or examination, only 14% had the classic triad. Elevated bicarbonate was present in 61% of blood samples, whereas hypochloremia was found in only 29%. Ultrasound confirmed the diagnosis in 89%. Surgical techniques were similar in outcome, except that incomplete pyloromyotomy was more common with the laparoscopic approach compared with the periumbilical approach. CONCLUSIONS: IHPS occurs more frequently in boys and infants who were born preterm. It commonly presents without the full spectrum of classic findings. Given the availability of ultrasound diagnosis, IHPS should be considered in infants with any 1 of these findings. Comments.

### Negative exploration for pyloric stenosis – is it preventable? [^21e9a130]. BMC Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Ultrasonography is now a well established diagnostic modality for the diagnosis of pyloric stenosis. Since its first description by Teele and Smith in 1977, the diagnostic criteria for pyloric stenosis on US have been made more stringent in an attempt to minimise false positive results and unnecessary surgery. A combination of definite measurements of canal length and muscle thickness is now expected for confident ultrasonographic diagnosis. Reported over-reliance on US by clinicians has also been attributed earlier presentation of infants and the pressure on early diagnosis in the modern cost-conscious health service. Accuracy in measuring the dimensions of the pylorus is critically dependent on the experience of the individual sonographer, who should see sufficient number of cases to maintain expertise. Currently in the UK NHS, paediatric surgery has become mainly restricted to tertiary centres, and hence with this move, the diagnostic capabilities and experts in paediatric surgical conditions are concentrated in tertiary centres. With these provisions, we now prefer an 'in-house' US for diagnosis of IHPS, defined as one performed by a tertiary centre paediatric radiologist who performs these scans routinely. An upper GI contrast study is not reliable in the diagnosis of IHPS, as it can mistake pylorospasm for canal obstruction. In cases of diagnostic uncertainty between IHPS and GOR, a contrast swallow can help to establish diagnosis of GOR. However, it is clinically difficult to justify using a contrast study in cases where there are typical features of IHPS on US.

Less than 60% of infants had a supporting biochemical picture in our series. The presence of alkalosis supports but does not confirm the diagnosis. In our study, 2 NL infants had evidence of alkalosis at presentation.

The early presentation of children with IHPS may give an equivocal clinical, biochemical and radiological picture. In such circumstances, the infant should be observed and re-evaluated in 1–2 days when the lesion may become demonstrable clinically or radiologically. If there is no palpable 'tumour' on a test feed, criteria for surgery should include definite diagnostic measurements by US followed by finding a palpable pyloric mass on examination under anaesthetic (EUA). In the absence of palpable mass on EUA, we now use upper GI endoscopy to demonstrate features of IHPS and confirm the diagnosis before proceeding with pyloromyotomy.

### Association of prematurity with the development of infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis [^6ae0d790]. Pediatric Research (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS) has several known risk factors. The association between prematurity and IHPS and the timeline of presentation are poorly defined. Our aim was to evaluate the associations between IHPS and prematurity.

Methods

We performed a retrospective cohort study of 1,074,236 children born between June 2001 and April 2012 in the US Military Health System. IHPS cases and gestational ages (GA) were identified using billing codes. Additional risk factors for IHPS were controlled for in a multivariable logistic regression model.

Results

The incidence of IHPS was 2.99 per 1,000 in preterm infants and 2.25 per 1,000 in full term (relative risk (RR) = 1.33, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.16–1.54). The adjusted odds ratio for prematurity was 1.26 (95% CI 1.08–1.46). The median (interquartile range (IQR)) chronological age at presentation was 40 d (30–56) in preterm infants vs. 33 d (26–45) in full term (P < 0.001). Median postmenstrual age at presentation was 42wk in preterm infants (40–42) vs. 45wk (44–46) in full term (P < 0.001).

Conclusion

Prematurity is associated with IHPS. Premature infants develop IHPS at a later chronological age, but earlier postmenstrual age, than term infants. Providers should have an increased concern for IHPS development in premature infants.

### Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis in newborns younger than 21 days: remodeling the path of surgical intervention [^e3b0e14d]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Background

According to currently accepted diagnostic criteria, ultrasonography confirms hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (HPS) when the pyloric muscle thickness (MT) is greater than 4 mm and the pyloric channel length (CL) is greater than 15 mm. Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis frequently presents in newborns younger than 21 days; yet, the diagnostic criteria in this younger population remain poorly defined. We, therefore, sought to define the diagnostic criteria for HPS in newborns younger than 21 days.

Methods

Ultrasonographic measures of pyloric MT and CL were obtained by retrospective chart review (2000–2006) at a single institution for all newborns (aged 10 days to 6 weeks) with an intraoperatively proven diagnosis of HPS. Demographic characteristics and ultrasonographic measurements were collected, and features differentiating younger (21 days or younger) from older newborns were assessed. Measures of pyloric MT and CL were analyzed in 7-day increments, and comparisons were made between newborns aged 21 days or less and newborns 22 to 42 days of age. Based upon these features, a set of ultrasonographic parameters to establish the diagnosis of HPS in younger patients was defined.

Results

Three hundred fourteen newborns (83% male) underwent pyloromyotomy of whom 64% (n = 200) had a preoperative pyloric ultrasound. Sixty newborns (19%) were younger than 21 days, of whom 51 (85%) had preoperative ultrasonography. The ultrasound measurement of HPS was significantly decreased in younger vs older newborns: (MT, 3.7 ± 0.65 vs 4.6 ± 0.82 mm, P < .05; CL, 16.9 ± 2.8 vs 18.2 ± 3.4 mm, P < .05). Importantly, the mean ultrasound measurement for young newborns with HPS typically fell within the currently defined "normal" or "borderline" range. A linear relationship was determined to exist between pyloric MT and CL and patient age, suggesting the use of 3.5 mm as a "cutoff" in younger patients.

Conclusions

These findings suggest that current guidelines to diagnose HPS do not accurately diagnose HPS in children younger than 3 weeks, and these findings raise the need to evaluate the decision analysis algorithm using prospective studies.

### Evaluation of ultrasonographic parameters in the diagnosis of pyloric stenosis relative to patient age and size [^9265c04a]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Pyloric thickness of 3 mm or higher and length of 15 mm or higher by ultrasonography (US) is widely accepted as diagnostic criteria for pyloric stenosis (PS). However, infants presenting at earlier ages are held to this same criteria, which may not be applicable.

Methods

Retrospective review was conducted on patients evaluated with pyloric US to rule out PS from May 2010 through December 2010. Pearson correlation was used to detect an association between weight and age with pyloric thickness and length. Sensitivity and specificity for US parameters were determined.

Results

Three hundred four patients underwent 318 ultrasounds, of which 67 had PS. Of those with PS, age and weight had a positive correlation with thickness (P < .007), and age positively correlated with length (P < .001). In patients with and without PS, there was a negative correlation for both age and weight with thickness (P < .02). Those who did not have PS held a stronger negative correlation between age and thickness (P = 0.002). Overall, US had a 100% sensitivity and specificity for PS. Thickness of 3 mm or higher was 100% sensitive and 99% specific, and pyloric length of 15 mm or higher was 100% sensitive and 97% specific.

Conclusions

Although significant associations between age and weight with pyloric thickness and length may exist, our data indicate that this does not have an impact on the diagnostic criteria for PS.

### Esophageal atresia with concomitant hypertrophic pyloric stenosis: a case series and literature review [^e05306c3]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

HPS may coexist with EA, with an incidence of approximately 3.8% in our institutional cohort. It often presents later in the disease course. Its typical symptoms may be masked by postoperative complications such as anastomotic stricture and prolonged use of jejunal feeding tubes, leading to delayed diagnosis. Early recognition and timely laparoscopic pyloromyotomy usually result in favorable outcomes. Long-term follow-up is recommended, and further multicenter studies are needed to establish optimal management strategies.

### Recovery after open versus laparoscopic pyloromyotomy for pyloric stenosis: a double-blind multicentre randomised controlled trial [^0beebe5d]. Lancet (2009). Excellent credibility.

Background

A laparoscopic approach to pyloromyotomy for infantile pyloric stenosis has gained popularity but its effectiveness remains unproven. We aimed to compare outcomes after open or laparoscopic pyloromyotomy for the treatment of pyloric stenosis.

Methods

We did a multicentre international, double-blind, randomised, controlled trial between June, 2004, and May, 2007, across six tertiary paediatric surgical centres. 180 infants were randomly assigned to open (n = 93) or laparoscopic pyloromyotomy (n = 87) with minimisation for age, weight, gestational age at birth, bicarbonate at initial presentation, feeding type, preoperative duration of symptoms, and trial centre. Infants with a diagnosis of pyloric stenosis were eligible. Primary outcomes were time to achieve full enteral feed and duration of postoperative recovery. We aimed to recruit 200 infants (100 per group); however, the data monitoring and ethics committee recommended halting the trial before full recruitment because of significant treatment benefit in one group at interim analysis. Participants, parents, and nursing staff were unaware of treatment. Data were analysed on an intention-to-treat basis with regression analysis. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00144924.

Findings

Time to achieve full enteral feeding in the open pyloromyotomy group was (median [IQR]) 23.9 h (16.0–41.0) versus 18.5 h (12.3–24.0; p = 0.002) in the laparoscopic group; postoperative length of stay was 43.8 h (25.3–55.6) versus 33.6 h (22.9–48.1; p = 0.027). Postoperative vomiting, and intra-operative and postoperative complications were similar between the two groups.

Interpretation

Both open and laparoscopic pyloromyotomy are safe procedures for the management of pyloric stenosis. However, laparoscopy has advantages over open pyloromyotomy, and we recommend its use in centres with suitable laparoscopic experience.

### Esophageal atresia with concomitant hypertrophic pyloric stenosis: a case series and literature review [^474863be]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study reviewed five cases of EA with concomitant HPS treated at our institution, along with 48 previously reported cases from the literature. This combined dataset represents one of the most comprehensive case series published to date on this rare congenital anomaly. Our findings indicate that HPS typically presents in a delayed manner following EA repair. With timely diagnosis and appropriate surgical intervention, the overall prognosis for affected patients is favorable.

The incidence of HPS among neonates with EA in our center was 3.8%. This rate appears higher than the expected incidence of isolated HPS in the general population. A similar trend has been observed in previous case series, which reported frequencies of HPS ranging from 2.5% to 7.5% among EA patients. Consistent with previous reports, most patients with EA and HPS in this study were male, and Gross type C was the predominant EA subtype. EA repair was typically completed within the first week of life, while the onset of HPS usually occurred between the 1 to 3 months after birth, mirroring the natural course of isolated HPS. In our cohort, all patients received intraoperative placement of a jejunal feeding tube, and early enteral nutrition was initiated postoperatively, which may have helped prevent further nutritional deterioration before HPS was diagnosed.

In our cohort, symptoms of HPS appeared between 18 and 111 days of age, with a median age at diagnosis of 45 days. This was later than the typical onset of isolated HPS. A possible reason is that many EA patients begin oral feeding late due to complications such as anastomotic stricture, severe gastroesophageal reflux, or prolonged jejunal feeding. These altered feeding patterns reduce exposure to postprandial vomiting, thereby masking the classical presentation of HPS and delaying its recognition. One patient (Case 1) experienced a marked delay in both symptom onset and diagnosis, likely due to prolonged jejunal feeding after severe esophageal stricture. These findings emphasize the need for high clinical suspicion of HPS in EA patients who require long-term enteral nutrition, even before regular oral feeding is initiated, especially when signs such as feeding intolerance or gastric retention are present.

### Negative exploration for pyloric stenosis – is it preventable? [^3136c644]. BMC Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Results

Demographics

The mean age at surgery of the study population (296 male and 47 female) was 35 days (range 3–150) and the mean duration of symptoms was 9.5 days (range 1–56).

Test feed

A test feed was documented in 219/343 (64%) of infants. Of these, 205 (93.6%) were positive. Eighty (38.5%) children underwent pyloromyotomy without US, purely on the basis of a positive test feed.

Radiology

An US scan was done in 270/343 (79%) children. All but one of the 270 US scans were reported to be positive. Sixty four of these were done in another referring hospital prior to transfer. In 39 studies (including 13 performed at our hospital), the scan was reported as showing pyloric stenosis, without stating the diagnostic measurements. Among the US scans reported as positive, 230 infants had a pyloric canal length more than 14 mm, and 220 had muscle thickness of at least 4 mm. The positive predictive value for an ultrasound (US) diagnosis was 99.1% for canal length ≥ 14 mm, and 98.7% for muscle thickness ≥ 4 mm. One hundred and twenty four infants had an US diagnosis without a test feed, and 14 had a negative test feed but positive US diagnosis.

Biochemical analysis

The case notes and transfer letters from peripheral hospitals were reviewed for evidence of biochemical abnormalities consistent with a diagnosis of pyloric stenosis. One hundred and seventy five (55%) patients had obvious evidence of alkalosis (defined as pH ≥ 7.45 or BE ≥ 2.5). Hypokalemia (K < 4) was observed in 38 infants and hypochloremia (Cl < 95) in 32.

### Bilious vomiting does not rule out infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis [^b16e8592]. Clinical Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the incidence of bilious vomiting in infants with infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis that presented to a pediatric emergency department.

Methods

A retrospective medical record review included all infants who presented to our level 1 pediatric emergency department from January 1, 2005, through December 31, 2009, who were diagnosed intraoperatively with infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis. Emesis was determined to be bilious if the vomit was described as "green", "containing bile", or "bilious".

Results

The authors identified 354 infants with infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis. The median age was 4 weeks 6 days (range = 11 days to 13 weeks). Bilious emesis was encountered in 1.4% (5/354; 95% confidence interval = 0.5% to 3.2%). The pyloric thickness measurements on ultrasound were significantly smaller in those with bilious emesis compared with those without bilious emesis (z score = 2.64; P = 0.014).

Conclusion

Bilious emesis was the presenting symptom in a small proportion of infants with infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis.

### Esophageal atresia with concomitant hypertrophic pyloric stenosis: a case series and literature review [^ef688ef4]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Combined analysis

We combined our institutional series with cases from the literature, for a total of 53 patients. Most were male (44/53, 83.0%) and classified as Gross type C EA (46/53, 86.8%). The typical course included early EA repair in the neonatal period. HPS symptoms appeared later, usually between 2 and 15 weeks of age. The median age of onset was 4 weeks (IQR: 2.5–6 weeks). All patients underwent sequential surgical correction. We constructed a Kaplan–Meier survival curve by combining institutional and literature cases (Fig. 2). The overall survival rate was 90.6%. Most deaths were associated with severe anomalies or infection. Most patients achieved good survival during follow-up.

### Perioperative care of infants with pyloric stenosis [^363da669]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2015). Low credibility.

Pyloric stenosis (PS) is one of the most common surgical conditions affecting neonates and young infants. The definitive treatment for PS is surgical pyloromyotomy, either open or laparoscopic. However, surgical intervention should never be considered urgent or emergent. More importantly, emergent medical intervention may be required to correct intravascular volume depletion and electrolyte disturbances. Given advancements in surgical and perioperative care, morbidity and mortality from PS should be limited. However, either may occur related to poor preoperative resuscitation, anesthetic management difficulties, or postoperative complications. The following manuscript reviews the current evidence-based medicine regarding the perioperative care of infants with PS with focus on the preoperative assessment and correction of metabolic abnormalities, intraoperative care including airway management (particularly debate related to rapid sequence intubation), maintenance anesthetic techniques, and techniques for postoperative pain management. Additionally, reports of applications of regional anesthesia for either postoperative pain control or as an alternative to general anesthesia are discussed. Management recommendations are provided whenever possible.

### Pyloric stenosis in premature infants… [^e258b54d]. JAMA Network (1996). Excellent credibility.

The diagnosis and treatment of pyloric stenosis in infants has been well established for many years. 1 The incidence of pyloric stenosis in premature infants is unusual, 1 the presentation is atypical, 2–5 and the diagnosis delayed, if not difficult. 2–5 Recently, four premature infants with pyloric stenosis demonstrated these features and underscored the limitations of ultrasonographic imaging in premature infants. 5, 6. Patient Reports. Patient 1. A premature male infant with the onset of nonprojectile vomiting at 6 weeks of age was evaluated by ultrasound at 7 weeks of age. Ultrasound findings were normal, and vomiting persisted. An upper gastrointestinal contrast study performed at 8 weeks of age confirmed pyloric stenosis. Patient 2. A premature male infant with the onset of nonbilious nonprojectile vomiting at 5 weeks of age was evaluated Janik JS, Wayne ER, Janik JP.

### Hyperkalemia and pyloric stenosis [^bf62cc3f]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2003). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Children presenting with pyloric stenosis have hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis and their serum potassium levels are thought to be low or normal. We reviewed potassium levels in infants with pyloric stenosis. Thirty-six percent of patients with pyloric stenosis had increased serum potassium levels. We conclude that hyperkalemia may be more common in children with pyloric stenosis than previously thought.

Implications

A significant number of infants with pyloric stenosis have a serum potassium value above the normal limit.

### Imaging findings in infants with recurrent vomiting after pyloromyotomy: a pictorial review [^d1d1705e]. Emergency Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (HPS) is a common entity with an incidence of 2–4 per 1000 live births. Current definitive treatment is with pyloromyotomy, which is usually performed laparoscopically. The procedure is generally well tolerated with resolution of the patient's symptoms. In a small percentage of patients, however, there is recurrent vomiting which warrants further investigation. In this pictorial review, the expected post-operative appearance of the pylorus will be described, and the imaging findings and clinical course of two patients with recurrent vomiting after pyloromyotomy will be presented.

### Esophageal atresia with concomitant hypertrophic pyloric stenosis: a case series and literature review [^ebebe361]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Differentiating HPS from EA-related complications requires careful evaluation. Reflux-related vomiting is usually intermittent and associated with feeding, whereas HPS often presents as progressively forceful, projectile, non-bilious emesis. Persistent vomiting despite adequate dilatation of anastomotic strictures should raise suspicion of HPS. Imaging is critical for diagnosis. Ultrasonography is the first-line modality and allows direct measurement of pyloric muscle thickness and length. Upper gastrointestinal contrast studies are supplementary and provide functional information such as delayed gastric emptying. In our study, ultrasound was the main diagnostic method, consistent with current guidelines. While ultrasound effectively measures pyloric muscle thickness and length, contrast studies provide additional functional assessment such as delayed gastric emptying. This complementary approach improves diagnostic accuracy.

In our cohort, the age at pyloromyotomy ranged from 20 to 147 days, which is slightly older than the operative age reported in the literature. However, all procedures were performed before the onset of significant metabolic derangements. All patients underwent laparoscopic pyloromyotomy with uneventful recovery. This supports the safety and efficacy of minimally invasive surgery in this population. Previous studies also confirmed that laparoscopic pyloromyotomy provides definitive treatment for HPS with minimal trauma and fast recovery. Our literature review also identified several earlier reports of open pyloromyotomy. These patients generally achieved satisfactory outcomes in terms of symptom resolution and survival. Taken together, timely diagnosis and surgical intervention usually lead to a good prognosis, as demonstrated by the complete survival in our five institutional cases. However, cases complicated by severe infections such as sepsis, complex anomalies, or significant diagnostic delay may still have a higher risk of mortality. Two patients in our cohort required additional management for esophageal strictures, including repeated balloon dilatation under endoscopy. This highlights the need for long-term multidisciplinary care focused on both esophageal and pyloric function.

Although our institutional series was limited in size, the addition of a comprehensive literature review provided a broader understanding of this rare dual anomaly. Nevertheless, several limitations should be acknowledged. First, our review was not prospectively registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO), which may introduce reporting bias. Second, heterogeneity in case reporting and the retrospective design of both our cohort and the included studies limit the strength of causal inferences. Third, many of the included studies were single case reports or small case series, which represent low-level evidence and may be affected by reporting or publication bias. Larger multicenter prospective studies are needed to validate these findings, clarify clinical patterns, and optimize management strategies.

### Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis: tips and tricks for ultrasound diagnosis [^1875dcc3]. Insights Into Imaging (2012). Low credibility.

We describe a systematic approach to the ultrasound (US) examination of the antropyloric region in children. US is the modality of choice for the diagnosis of hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (HPS). The imaging features of the normal pylorus and the diagnostic findings in HPS are reviewed and illustrated in this pictorial essay. Common difficulties in performing the examination and tips to help overcome them will also be discussed. Main Messages
- Hypertrophic Pyloric Stenosis is defined by thickening of the muscular layer and failure in relaxation of the pyloric canal.
- The main diagnostic criterion is a measurement of more than 3mm in thickness of the muscular layer.
- Abnormal elongation of the canal is characterised as greater than 12 mm in length.

### The changing clinical presentation of hypertrophic pyloric stenosis: the experience of a large, tertiary care pediatric hospital [^0c4c1f42]. Clinical Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

The authors reviewed the clinical and laboratory data from cases of hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (HPS) diagnosed at their institution from 2006 to 2008. They assessed and compared presentation of patients with HPS over time at their institution. A total of 118 patients were included in this study. An "olive" was palpated in only 13.6% of cases. This is in contrast to older studies, where more than 50% of the patients were reported to have a palpable "olive" depending on when the study was conducted. In patients from this institution, hypochloremia was present in 23% and alkalosis in 14.4%, which are less frequent than the incidence of these abnormalities in older studies. There was a change in the additional "classical" symptoms, represented by the lower percentage of infants in whom an "olive" was palpated and the lower numbers of patients with severe electrolyte imbalances. The reason for this change appears to be the frequent use of ultrasound.

### Esophageal atresia with concomitant hypertrophic pyloric stenosis: a case series and literature review [^393e76f0]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

Study design and ethical approval

This study consisted of a single-center retrospective case review and a systematic literature review. Ethical approval was obtained from the institutional review board (2019-k-333), and all data were anonymized before analysis.

Patients and data collection

We retrospectively reviewed all neonates diagnosed with EA who were treated at our institution during the study period (January 1, 2018-January 1, 2025). Among these patients, a subset was subsequently identified with concomitant HPS. EA was diagnosed based on failure to pass a nasogastric tube and radiographic evidence of a blind-ending pouch. HPS was diagnosed by typical clinical signs (projectile non-bilious vomiting), ultrasonographic criteria (pyloric muscle thickness > 3 mm and length > 15 mm), or upper gastrointestinal series (showing the "string sign").

The extracted clinical data included gender, gestational age, birth weight, EA type (Gross classification), age at EA surgery, age of HPS symptom onset, age at HPS diagnosis, age at pyloromyotomy, and outcomes.

Literature search strategy

This study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A comprehensive search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) databases to identify relevant case reports and case series published from January 1, 1965 to March 1, 2025. Search terms included "esophageal atresia", "oesophageal atresia", "tracheoesophageal fistula", "hypertrophic pyloric stenosis", "infantile pyloric stenosis", and "pyloric stenosis". No language restrictions were applied. Two independent reviewers (initials: ZZL and AW) screened titles, abstracts, and full texts to identify eligible studies. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion with a third reviewer (DDW).

Eligibility criteria

We included case reports and case series of neonates or infants diagnosed with EA with concomitant HPS. Studies without original patient data, reviews, and conference abstracts were excluded.

Quality assessment

The methodological quality of included case reports and case series was evaluated using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal Checklist for Case Reports/Case Series. For one non-randomized study, the Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies (MINORS) was additionally applied. The assessment process was conducted independently by two reviewers (ZZL, AW) and results are summarized in Supplementary Table 1.

### Infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis: are viruses involved? [^00611d08]. Journal of Medical Virology (2010). Low credibility.

Infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS) is characterized by abnormal thickening of the internal circular muscle layer. IHPS is known to be due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors, but its precise causes and pathophysiology are poorly understood. The objective of the study is to determine the prevalence of the principal viruses targeting the respiratory and digestive tracts in children with IHPS. Nasopharyngeal fluids, stools, vomit, and surgical pyloric muscle fragments and swabs were tested by cell culture, viral antigen assay and PCR. IHPS was diagnosed in 23 boys and 8 girls with a mean (± SD) age of 42 ± 15 days (range 20–88 days). There was no seasonal pattern of diagnosis. Twenty-two children (71%) lost weight (mean 246 ± 164 g, range 30–600 g) after the onset of vomiting, and five (16.1%) were dehydrated. Seven (22.6%) infants had been exposed to an infectious contact within 15 days before admission, and one on the day of admission (3.2%). Ear, nose and throat samples and pyloric muscle specimens were negative for all the viruses tested. An adenovirus type 3 was recovered from one stool sample, and RT-PCR was positive for an enterovirus on one vomit sample. This study suggests that the principal viruses targeting the respiratory and digestive tracts are not responsible for IHPS.

### Imaging acute non-traumatic abdominal pathologies in pediatric patients: a pictorial review [^30f3e713]. Journal of Radiology Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

The dilemma of acute non-traumatic abdominal pathologies in the pediatric population depends on the age of the patients and symptoms. Surgical etiologies in patients younger than 2 years of age include intussusception, pyloric stenosis, malrotation and midgut volvulus. In older patients, considerations become closer to differential etiologies in adults including acute appendicitis. Ultrasound and fluoroscopic examinations remain the mainstay for diagnosis that may even be therapeutic such as contrast/air enemas in intussusception reduction. There is an increasing role for CT in appendicitis and renal colic especially in assessing complications; however, it is less favored because it incurs radiation to the patient. This article summarizes the imaging approach to pediatric patients with acute abdominal pathologies presenting to the emergency department, and how imaging is instrumental in guiding diagnosis and treatment, with emphasis on radiation safety, in the context of providing typical imaging findings of each pathology in this pictorial review.

### Management and outcomes for children with pyloric stenosis stratified by hospital type [^16b77142]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Access to health care has been a source of controversy and public attention in health policy. The issues of access to and utilization of the healthcare system by infants and children is less well documented. Moreover, the impact on outcomes of race, ethnicity, and economic status in infants is vaguely addressed.

Methods

We performed a retrospective analysis of children who had undergone pyloromyotomy from July 31, 1998 to July 31, 2008 at our public hospital and university teaching hospital. Data abstracted included gestational age at delivery, birth weight, gender, race, insurance status, age at presentation, symptom duration, preoperative ultrasound (US), operative date, laboratory evaluations, as well as preoperative, postoperative, and total length of stay (LOS).

Results

The mean total preoperative LOS was twice as long at our public hospital than our private hospital (1.78 d versus 0.85 d, P = 0.003). Similarly, the mean total length of stay was 0.87 d longer at our public hospital (3.87 d versus 3 d), which trended toward significance (P = 0.06). Significantly, 72% (27/33) patients at the private hospital had their US either as an out-patient or on the day of admission, while only 58% (28/48) had an US performed as expeditiously at the public hospital (P = 0.03, χ² analysis).

Conclusions

Care at our public hospital leads to delayed diagnosis and treatment, resulting in longer preoperative and total LOS in infants with pyloric stenosis, most likely related to the timing of the preoperative US. Efforts should be made to encourage patients to use the outpatient clinic facilities for their ill infants, or for physicians at public hospitals to expedite the US process once the diagnosis of pyloric stenosis is entertained.

### Feasibility of point-of-care ultrasound for diagnosing hypertrophic pyloric stenosis in the emergency department [^49e1c57d]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Vomiting is a common complaint for which young infants are brought to the emergency department (ED). Almost 50% of infants aged younger than 90 days vomit more than once a day; however, most of these episodes are related to gastroesophageal reflux and often resolve spontaneously. Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (HPS) is a rare cause of vomiting diagnosed in this age group with a prevalence of 2 per 1000 live births. Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis can lead to dehydration with worsening of vomiting until surgical pyloromyotomy is performed. – Hence, rapid and accurate diagnosis of HPS is crucial for timely treatment in addition to differentiating HPS from other benign causes of vomiting.

The classic presentation of HPS is progressive projectile nonbilious vomiting with a palpable olive-like mass in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. Nevertheless, these clinical findings are often subjective and even unreliable, especially in the early stage of HPS. Radiologist-performed ultrasound (RADUS) for diagnosing HPS has been widely used as a confirmatory imaging modality; however, the varying availability of radiology may increase the overall length of stay in the ED (EDLOS). Recently, several studies have reported on the diagnostic yield of point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) performed by emergency physicians for various pediatric conditions, – and a pilot study in which 10 cases of HPS among 67 patients were diagnosed by pediatric emergency physicians performing POCUS showed promising results, with 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity. These results suggest that POCUS may be a useful tool for the diagnosis of HPS in the ED; however, larger scale studies are needed.

This study aimed to investigate the feasibility of POCUS for diagnosing HPS in the ED, the diagnostic performance of POCUS, and its effect on ED patient flow as compared with patients undergoing RADUS.

### Esophageal atresia with concomitant hypertrophic pyloric stenosis: a case series and literature review [^77892841]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

Institutional cases

During the study period, a total of 132 neonates with EA were treated at our center. Among them, five patients (5/132, 3.8%) were subsequently diagnosed with HPS. Their clinical characteristics are summarized in Table 1. Of these five patients, three were male and two were female. Four patients had Gross type C EA, and one had type D. One patient was born preterm, while the others were full-term. The birth weights ranged from 2010 to 3600 g. None of the patients had perinatal or postnatal exposure to macrolide antibiotics such as erythromycin or azithromycin.

Table 1
Clinical characteristics of five cases of EA complicated with HPS

All patients underwent EA repair within the first week of life (median age: 4 days; range: 3–6 days). A jejunal feeding tube was placed intraoperatively in all patients, and enteral nutrition was initiated on postoperative day 3. Two patients received formula feeding, while the other three received mixed feeding. The median duration of jejunal tube placement was 10 days (range: 7–108 days). Case 1 and Case 2 developed severe postoperative esophageal strictures and were initially unable to tolerate oral feeding. After endoscopic balloon dilation, the jejunal feeding tubes were removed on postoperative days 108 and 44, respectively. Notably, Case 1 required prolonged reliance on jejunal tube feeding, which contributed to a delayed manifestation of HPS-related symptoms.

Typical symptoms of HPS, such as projectile, non-bilious vomiting, appeared at a median age of 34 days (range: 18–111 days), and the diagnosis was confirmed at a median age of 45 days (range: 20–145 days). The median interval between symptom onset and final diagnosis was 9 days (range: 1–34 days). Ultrasound was the primary diagnostic modality, with two patients requiring additional upper gastrointestinal contrast studies for confirmation.

All patients underwent laparoscopic pyloromyotomy at a median age of 46 days (range: 20–147 days). The median time to first oral feeding was 1 day (range: 1–2 days), and the median time to achieve full enteral feeding was 3 days (range: 2–4 days). None of the patients experienced any HPS-related complications following surgery. The median postoperative hospital stay was 7 days (range: 5–10 days). At a median follow-up of 50 months (range: 6–90 months), all patients were alive, although two remained under follow-up for esophageal stricture–related issues.

### Incidence and importance of portal venous gas in children with hypertrophic pyloric stenosis [^4a7fdd48]. Pediatric Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (HPS) is a common cause of gastric outlet obstruction in young infants. Infants with HPS present with projectile vomiting, sometimes have electrolyte abnormalities and typically undergo pyloromyotomy to alleviate the obstruction. Abdominal US is the gold standard imaging study for diagnosis. Case reports of incidental hepatic portal venous gas have been reported in infants with HPS; however, no large studies have been conducted to determine the incidence or possible clinical implications of this finding.

Objective

To assess the incidence of portal venous gas in infants with HPS and to determine whether the presence of this gas in infants with HPS indicates a more unstable patient, increased length of stay or worse outcome.

Materials and Methods

We conducted a retrospective review of sonographic reports containing "pyloric stenosis", excluding negative descriptor, at a tertiary-care children's hospital from November 2010 to September 2017. Data collected included pyloric thickness/length, liver evaluation, portal venous gas, any additional imaging, demographics, symptomatology days, electrolyte abnormality, and length of hospital stay.

Results

In a 7-year period, 545 US exams were positive for HPS. Of these, 334 exams included enough hepatic parenchyma to evaluate for portal venous gas. Infants in 6 of the 334 exams demonstrated portal venous gas (1.8%). Clinical presentation (length of symptoms and electrolyte abnormalities), demographics (male predominance and age at presentation) and imaging characteristics (pyloric thickness and length) were similar for the HPS groups with and without portal venous gas. There was no significant difference in outcome or length of hospital stay.

Conclusion

Visualization of portal venous gas in infants with HPS is not rare and appears benign, without need for further imaging. Portal venous gas in infants with HPS does not portend a more severe patient presentation or outcome.

### Infant presenting with pyloric stenosis and autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age (PMA) [^de3399d1]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

This case report describes a premature male infant born after a pregnancy complicated by oligohydramnios of unknown aetiology but otherwise unremarkable prenatal scans. He had sudden onset of projectile emesis and severe hypertension in the third week of life, and further investigations revealed both pyloric stenosis and polycystic kidneys, at just 36 weeks' postmenstrual age (PMA). His course thereafter was complicated by severe refractory hypertension requiring multiple antihypertensive agents in order to gain control, although his renal function remained normal. Few case reports have previously described this unusual association, but none have presented with both entities at such an early PMA.

### Cystic fibrosis and infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis: is there an association? [^4b508d94]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2002). Low credibility.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common lethal genetic disease among Caucasian populations. The generally accepted incidence of CF in the United States is 1 in 3,200 in the Caucasian population. Intestinal obstructions and atresias have been described among patients with CF. An association of CF with infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS) has not been previously documented. A review in our clinic of 72 patients with CF revealed IHPS in two. The incidence of 2.7% is greater than the 0.3% incidence expected in the general population. This ninefold increase in IHPS in patients with CF suggests an association between the two and warrants further investigation.

### ASGE guideline on the role of endoscopy in the management of benign and malignant gastroduodenal obstruction [^b3c083dd]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2021). High credibility.

Considerations for the pediatric population — pediatric GOO is usually benign; the most common cause is infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis with typical nonbilious emesis, and surgery is considered the standard management for this condition. Outside of infancy, standard endoscopy is only used to exclude other diagnoses and EUS has been used in some cases. Beyond infancy, peptic and caustic ulceration are the most common causes, with reported anatomic malformations and bezoars; malignancy-related GOO is rare in children. EBD has been used for therapy, with limited reports of needle-knife incisional therapy and SEMS placement.

### Late-onset hypertrophic pyloric stenosis: definition of diagnostic criteria and algorithm for the management [^8e44f60c]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Gastric outlet obstruction (GOO) may be caused by various congenital and acquired conditions in children. The authors report 11 cases of GOO caused by muscular hypertrophy of the pylorus, which was proven histologically in 7. They describe this entity as "late-onset hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (HPS)", define the diagnostic criteria of the disease, and produce an algorithm for its management.

Materials and Methods

The medical records of patients with GOO treated from 1999 and 2009 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients with infantile HPS and GOO secondary to corrosive ingestion or neoplasm were not included. Age, sex, family history, presenting symptoms and signs, radiologic methods and findings, type of management, histopathologic features, and outcome were noted for each patient.

Results

Eleven patients (4 male, 7 female) ranging in age from 2 to 8 years (mean, 3.6 years) were included in the study. The symptoms were nonbilious vomiting (n = 11), abdominal pain (n = 4), and weight loss (n = 2). Abdominal ultrasound (n = 6) and upper gastrointestinal contrast studies were obtained (n = 11). Gastroscopy revealed complete (n = 6) or partial (n = 5) obstruction of the pylorus. Balloon dilatation of the pylorus was performed in 5 cases and repeated in 3 cases. Conservative treatment was initially attempted in 11 patients. Two patients with chronic gastritis and Helicobacter pylori (n = 2) were treated with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, clarithromycin, and lansoprazole. A Billroth I procedure was performed in 7 cases. Hypertrophied pyloric muscle was noted in 7 patients and chronic gastritis in 2. The postoperative course was uneventful.

Conclusion

Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis is rarely seen after infancy. Analysis of our results and review of the literature prompted us to redescribe this entity as "late-onset HPS" and define the diagnostic criteria. Late-onset HPS is probably an acquired disease of unknown etiology. The management of late-onset HPS has been summarized in an algorithm, which will also be useful in the treatment of GOO in children caused by etiologies other than classical infantile HPS.

### Pyloric duplication with communication to the pancreas in a neonate simulating hypertrophic pyloric stenosis [^af8b50d7]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

An 11-day-old neonate presents with worsening nonbilious emesis and radiographic findings suggestive of pyloric stenosis. Using a laparoscopic approach, a slightly asymmetric and hypertrophied pylorus was visualized. The unusual age of presentation and appearance of the pylorus led to the decision to perform an open exploration for suspicion of a pyloric duplication. An incision of the pyloric muscle exposed and confirmed a duplication cyst. Further exposure revealed accessory pancreatic tissue communicating from the cyst to the main body of the pancreas. The duplication cyst and accessory pancreas were resected, and the patient had an uneventful recovery. Pyloric duplication is a rare cause of congenital extrinsic obstruction in the newborn. Even rarer is a communication of the duplication cyst with the pancreas. Resection of the duplication cyst and the aberrant pancreatic tissue and duct is recommended.

### Negative exploration for pyloric stenosis – is it preventable? [^fdbdbf6b]. BMC Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Background

The diagnosis of infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS), although traditionally clinical, is now increasingly dependent on radiological corroboration. The rate of negative exploration in IHPS has been reported as 4%. The purpose of our study was to look at elements of supportive clinical evidence leading to positive diagnosis, and to review these with respect to misdiagnosed cases undergoing negative exploration.

Methods

All infants undergoing surgical exploration for IHPS between January 2000 and December 2004 were retrospectively analysed with regard to clinical symptoms, examination findings, investigations and operative findings.

Results

During the study period, 343 explorations were performed with a presumptive diagnosis of IHPS. Of these, 205 infants (60%) had a positive test feed, 269 (78%) had a positive ultrasound scan and 175 (55%) were alkalotic (pH ≥ 7.45 and/or base excess ≥ 2.5). The positive predictive value for an ultrasound (US) diagnosis was 99.1% for canal length ≥ 14 mm, and 98.7% for muscle thickness ≥ 4 mm.

Four infants (1.1%) underwent a negative surgical exploration; Ultrasound was positive in 3, and negative in 1(who underwent surgery on the basis of a positive upper GI contrast). One US reported as positive had a muscle thickness < 4 mm. Two false positive US were performed at peripheral hospitals. One infant had a false positive test feed following a positive ultrasound diagnosis. Two infants had negative test feeds.

Conclusion

A 1% rate of negative exploration in IHPS compares favourably with other studies. However potential causes of error were identified in all 4 cases. Confident diagnosis comprises a combination of positive test feed and an 'in house US' in an alkalotic infant. UGI contrast study should not be used in isolation to diagnose IHPS. If the test feed is negative, strict diagnostic measurements should be observed on US and the pyloric 'tumour' palpated on table under anaesthetic before exploration.

### Treatment of neonatal chlamydial conjunctivitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^d5169f12]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2018). Low credibility.

Only 1 study reported the rate of pyloric stenosis; 0 of the 19 neonates who received erythromycin developed any signs or symptoms. Infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis typically presents between 3 and 8 weeks of age, and the length of follow-up in several of the studies was less than this time period. In addition, most of the included studies were published before 1999, the year in which the initial association between oral erythromycin and pyloric stenosis in infants after pertussis prophylaxis was elucidated. More recently, a study of a large retrospective cohort with more than 1 million infants with various infections revealed an increased risk of pyloric stenosis with both azithromycin and erythromycin. The authors of this study reported the highest risk in infants exposed before 2 weeks of age, and a slightly higher risk was found in infants given erythromycin than in those given azithromycin (adjusted odds ratios, 13.3 [95% CI, 6.8–15.9] and 8.3 [95% CI, 2.6–26], respectively). This result means that compared to the number of neonates between 0 and 14 days old who developed pyloric stenosis when not receiving any antimicrobial agent (approximately 2 of 1000), there might be 29 more neonates with pyloric stenosis when given erythromycin compared to 18 more when given azithromycin. Other studies also found an increased risk of pyloric stenosis after early exposure to erythromycin.

There are some limitations of our review. First, this systematic review was restricted to studies in which the investigators confirmed neonatal chlamydial conjunctivitis microbiologically, but in many low- and middle-income countries, microbiological diagnosis is not feasible. Nevertheless, this review measures the best possible cure rates of the drug regimens in neonates who have chlamydial conjunctivitis. Given that we found primarily nonrandomized studies that evaluated the effects of 1 drug in 1 group of neonates, we pooled proportions across studies. However, we did not attempt to compare statistically the pooled proportions of different regimens of erythromycin to each other or compare azithromycin to erythromycin because of the small numbers of neonates across studies and the degree of indirectness. Overall, the results of our review provide a synthesis of the best available evidence for the treatment of neonatal chlamydial conjunctivitis.

### Open versus laparoscopic pyloromyotomy for pyloric stenosis [^17ecfad9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS) is a disorder of young children (aged one year or less) and can be treated by laparoscopic (LP) or open (OP) longitudinal myotomy of the pylorus. Since the first description in 1990, LP is being performed more often worldwide.

Objectives

To compare the efficacy and safety of open versus laparoscopic pyloromyotomy for IHPS.

Search Methods

We conducted a literature search on 04 February 2021 to identify all randomised controlled trials (RCTs), without any language restrictions. We searched the following electronic databases: MEDLINE (1990 to February 2021), Embase (1990 to February 2021), and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). We also searched the Internet using the Google Search engine (www.google.com) and Google Scholar (scholar.google.com) to identify grey literature not indexed in databases.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs and quasi-randomised trials comparing LP with OP for hypertrophic pyloric stenosis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened references and extracted data from trial reports. Where outcomes or study details were not reported, we requested missing data from the corresponding authors of the primary RCTs. We used a random-effects model to calculate risk ratios (RRs) for binary outcomes, and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes. Two review authors independently assessed risks of bias. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for all outcomes.

Main Results

The electronic database search resulted in a total of 434 records. After de-duplication, we screened 410 independent publications, and ultimately included seven RCTs (reported in 8 reports) in quantitative analysis. The seven included RCTs enrolled 720 participants (357 with open pyloromyotomy and 363 with laparoscopic pyloromyotomy). One study was a multi-country trial, three were carried out in the USA, and one study each was carried out in France, Japan, and Bangladesh. The evidence suggests that LP may result in a small increase in mucosal perforation compared with OP (RR 1.60, 95% CI 0.49 to 5.26; 7 studies, 720 participants; low-certainty evidence). LP may result in up to 5 extra instances of mucosal perforation per 1,000 participants; however, the confidence interval ranges from 4 fewer to 44 more per 1,000 participants. Four RCTs with 502 participants reported on incomplete pyloromyotomy. They indicate that LP may increase the risk of incomplete pyloromyotomy compared with OP, but the confidence interval crosses the line of no effect (RR 7.37, 95% CI 0.92 to 59.11; 4 studies, 502 participants; low-certainty evidence). In the LP groups, 6 cases of incomplete pyloromyotomy were reported in 247 participants while no cases of incomplete pyloromyotomy were reported in the OP groups (from 255 participants). All included studies (720 participants) reported on postoperative wound infections or abscess formations. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of LP on postoperative wound infection or abscess formation compared with OP (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.45; 7 studies, 720 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The evidence is also very uncertain about the effect of LP on postoperative incisional hernia compared with OP (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.11 to 9.53; 4 studies, 382 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Length of hospital stay was assessed by five RCTs, including 562 participants. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of LP compared to OP (mean difference -3.01 hours, 95% CI -8.39 to 2.37 hours; very low-certainty evidence). Time to full feeds was assessed by six studies, including 622 participants. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of LP on time to full feeds compared with OP (mean difference -5.86 hours, 95% CI -15.95 to 4.24 hours; very low-certainty evidence). The evidence is also very uncertain about the effect of LP on operating time compared with OP (mean difference 0.53 minutes, 95% CI -3.53 to 4.59 minutes; 6 studies, 622 participants; very low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Laparoscopic pyloromyotomy may result in a small increase in mucosal perforation when compared with open pyloromyotomy for IHPS. There may be an increased risk of incomplete pyloromyotomy following LP compared with OP, but the effect estimate is imprecise and includes the possibility of no difference. We do not know about the effect of LP compared with OP on the need for re-operation, postoperative wound infections or abscess formation, postoperative haematoma or seroma formation, incisional hernia occurrence, length of postoperative stay, time to full feeds, or operating time because the certainty of the evidence was very low for these outcomes. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence for most outcomes due to limitations in the study design (most outcomes were susceptible to detection bias) and imprecision. There is limited evidence available comparing LP with OP for IHPS. The included studies did not provide sufficient information to determine the effect of training, experience, or surgeon preferences on the outcomes assessed.

### Diagnosis and management of Cornelia de Lange syndrome: first international consensus statement [^f99516b4]. Nature Reviews: Genetics (2018). Medium credibility.

Organ system manifestations

Gastroenterology

Individuals with CdLS have more frequent gastrointestinal malformations, such as duodenal atresia, annular pancreas, imperforate anus, Meckel diverticulumand congenital diaphragmatic hernia. Pyloric stenosis has been reported in up to 7% of patients, and inguinal hernia is common in childhood(R28).

Intestinal malrotation has been reported in 5% of a series of 73 individualsand in 10% of a series of 49 individuals, typically presenting as acute coecal volvulus. Intestinal malrotation may be recurrent, may present in infancy, childhood or puberty as a surgical emergency, and may be difficult to diagnose owing to a lack of awareness by physicians, atypical symptoms and difficulties in effective communication with affected individuals (R29, R30). Coecal volvulus is associated with significant mortality, which has led to the recommendation of imaging to prospectively check gastrointestinal mobility. Rarely, sigmoid volvulus occurs.

### Erythromycin and pyloric stenosis… [^1dbd44ea]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Source: Cooper WO, Griffin MR, Arbogast P, et al. Very early exposure to erythromycin and infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis. –650. To assess whether exposure to erythromycin early in life increases the risk for infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis, investigators from Vanderbilt University retrospectively analyzed a cohort of children born in Tennessee from 1985–1997 and enrolled in Medicaid or TennCare, that state's program for uninsured individuals. Exposure to antibiotics was determined from prescription files. The main outcome measure was identified by hospital discharge diagnosis of pyloric stenosis with an associated surgical procedure code. Among 314, 029 Medicaid births during this period, 804 met criteria for pyloric stenosis. Exposure to erythromycin between 3–13 days of life was associated with nearly an 8-fold increased risk of pyloric stenosis.

No increased risk of pyloric stenosis was noted in infants exposed after 13 days of life, or in infants exposed to other antibiotics. The authors conclude that this observed increase of pyloric stenosis after erythromycin exposure is consistent with other reports. They suggest caution before initiating erythromycin treatment in young infants. Infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis has been associated with previous exposure to erythromycin in several previous studies. 1–, 4 and this association has been previously reviewed here (see 5This retrospective study supports this association. However, the study's conclusions are based on only 2 cases of pyloric stenosis exposed to erythromycin from 3–13 days, and there was no information on the doses to which these 2 infants were exposed.

Nonetheless, the authors' recommendations are cogent: the risk of pyloric stenosis after early erythromycin exposure, approximately 1%, should be weighed against the potential benefit of treatment or prophylaxis, particularly when pertussis is suspected. Although tough to swallow, the data are increasingly compelling which state that administration of oral erythromycin to infants in the first 2 weeks of life is associated with an increased risk of pyloric stenosis. Nevertheless, administration of erythromycin after a significant exposure to pertussis is still justified. The risk of pertussis infection in household contacts, for instance, approximates 90%.

### Jodhpur disease revisited: a rare cause of severe protein energy malnutrition [^f0b2656a]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Discussion

Gastric outlet obstruction (GOO) is a condition where there is obstruction at the level of pylorus, i.e. at the outlet of stomach. The most common cause is infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS). If IHPS and other congenital causes are excluded, then GOO is rarely encountered. GOO in infancy and childhood was first described in India in 1997 by Dr. K.K. Sharma and was nicknamed "Jodhpur disease" after the place of its first description. Recently, it has been renamed "primary acquired GOO during infancy and childhood". Until now, 22 cases have been reported in the world literature, among which 14 are from India (13 from Jodhpur itself). It is a rare entity with an incidence of 1 in 100,000 live births, with predilection for male sex. Mean age of presentation is 2.9 years (range 1 month-6 years).

The exact etiology is still unknown. Various hypotheses have been put forward. One states that lack of nitric oxide synthase in neurons leads to failure to relax pyloric smooth muscle causing neuromuscular incoordination and later GOO, while another claims that the cause is an abnormality of the interstitial cells of Cajal that act as electrical pacemakers of GI tract smooth muscles.

Usual presentations include intractable and recurrent non-bilious projectile vomiting, weight loss, pain abdomen, abdominal distention and growth retardation. Diagnosis is aided by ultrasonography that shows normal pyloric canal with no pyloric muscle hypertrophy, while upper GI contrast study shows large stomach with increased gastric emptying time (Fig. 1). Gastroscopy reveals no intra-luminal pathology with normal gastric mucosal rugosities in a large-size stomach with narrow pyloric canal. CT scan is usually of no further help as it shows only typical picture of GOO with narrow pyloric canal. Histopathologically there is normal cellular pattern of all coats without inflammatory, fibro-proliferative or neoplastic cells with a normal number of ganglion cells. Management is essentially surgical with "Heineke-Mikulicz pyloroplasty" as the procedure of choice with excellent outcome. Pneumatic dilatation by balloon inflation via upper endoscopy has also been tried successfully.

In conclusion, clinical presentation mimicking idiopathic hypertrophic pyloric stenosis in older infants and children should be strongly considered for Jodhpur disease.

### Postoperative pyloric stenosis in the newborn: a forgotten problem [^9bb68128]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

Postoperative vomiting in newborns is a common finding usually attributed to the original surgery. We report 10 newborns whose postoperative course was complicated by pyloric stenosis.

Methods

We reviewed the charts of all newborns who had pyloric stenosis diagnosed after a major abdominothoracic operation over the past 30 years (1973–2003) at a single children's hospital.

Results

Ten cases of pyloric stenosis were diagnosed in postoperative newborns (esophageal atresia [3], small bowel atresia [2], diaphragmatic hernia, fetus-in-fetu, imperforate anus, lung biopsy, malrotation [1]). Their mean gestational age was 36 weeks, birth weight was 3.2 kg, and age at newborn operation was 2 days. Their postoperative feeds started on the sixth day (mean), and the pyloric stenosis vomiting started on the 14th day. It took a mean of 12 days to make the diagnosis of pyloric stenosis, and this was done entirely by diagnostic imaging. Mean age at pyloromyotomy was 3 1/2 weeks. A new incision was used in 7 patients. Postoperative feedings started on the first day; all did well. There were 3 complications (bowel obstruction), all requiring operation.

Conclusion

Unfortunately, this review offers no specific insight or novel advice to help the readership think about the diagnosis in such a postoperative setting.

### Esophageal atresia with concomitant hypertrophic pyloric stenosis: a case series and literature review [^65eee53f]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Congenital esophageal atresia (EA) is a serious malformation of the digestive tract that is often associated with tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF), with an incidence of approximately 1 in 2,500 to 4,000 live births. Advances in neonatal intensive care, surgical techniques, and perioperative management have significantly improved the survival of EA patients in recent decades. However, a recent 30-year, population-based study reported the incidence trends, associated anomalies, survival, and long-term outcomes in neonates with EA, and found that comorbidities and postoperative complications remain persistent challenges. A significant proportion of infants with EA also present with other congenital anomalies, among which gastrointestinal defects account for approximately 20%, including imperforate anus and duodenal obstruction. Congenital hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (HPS) is a relatively common cause of gastric outlet obstruction in infants, characterized by hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the pyloric circular muscle. Its incidence ranges from 4 to 5 per 1000 live births, with a marked male predominance.

In recent years, the coexistence of EA and HPS has garnered increasing clinical attention. Earlier studies reported an incidence of HPS in 1% to 10% of patients with EA, which is significantly higher than that in the general population, suggesting a potential pathophysiological link. However, the typical symptoms of HPS, such as non-bilious projectile vomiting, may be obscured by conditions frequently observed after EA repair, such as anastomotic stricture and gastroesophageal reflux. This overlap may contribute to diagnostic delays or misdiagnosis. Management of EA with coexisting HPS requires both esophageal reconstruction and timely surgical relief of pyloric obstruction. In most centers worldwide, laparoscopic pyloromyotomy has become the standard treatment because of its safety, minimal invasiveness, and outcomes comparable or superior to those of open surgery. The long-term prognosis depends largely on early recognition and appropriate intervention strategies. Although case reports on this rare association have been published, most are small, single-center series, and there is a lack of systematic analysis regarding the clinical characteristics, timing of diagnosis, and optimal treatment approaches.

In this study, we retrospectively reviewed five cases of EA with concomitant HPS admitted to our center, and analyzed them in combination with 48 previously reported cases. We aim to summarize the clinical features, diagnosis and treatment patterns of this rare coexisting anomaly, and to provide insights for optimizing its clinical management.

### Predictive factors for time to full enteral feeding after pyloromyotomy for infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis [^715829fb]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Statistical analyses

Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Mac, V.24 (IBM). Continuous variables were presented as median or interquartile range (IQR) (no normal distribution) or mean ± SD (normal distribution). Normal distribution was tested by evaluation of skewness and kurtosis. Dichotomous variables were presented as the absolute number and percentage of patients. The primary outcome of full enteral feeding was treated as a continuous parameter and different parameters were tested as independent variables, first in a univariate and then in a multivariate linear regression model. The results were presented as beta (B) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Reoperations and complications were also added to the regression analyses since they might have an impact on feeding.

Collinearity between the continuous parameters was evaluated. If moderate to strong correlation existed, the final regression model would be tested with and without the different variable(s). Further, we checked for heteroscedasticity by plotting the residuals of the final regression model against patients' age. A p value < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.

### Sonography and color Doppler sonography for monitoring conservatively treated infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis [^00275bd1]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the role of sonography in infants with hypertrophic pyloric stenosis undergoing conservative medical treatment.

Methods

Twenty-two infants (17 male and 5 female; age range, 1–12 weeks) were clinically and sonographically considered suitable for conservative treatment and underwent follow-up during the course of the disease. Sonography was performed under a standardized protocol and included color Doppler sonography.

Results

Fifteen infants (mean age, 9 weeks) needed surgery. They initially had a mean pyloric length of 18 mm, a diameter of 10.5 mm, and a wall thickness of 4 mm, with visible passage of food into the duodenum. These values deteriorated during follow-up (mean preoperative values: length, 20 mm; diameter, 12 mm; and wall thickness, 4.5 mm); furthermore, passage of food through the pyloric canal ceased. Seven infants (mean age, 3 weeks) were successfully treated conservatively Their initial mean pyloric measurements were slightly smaller (length, 15 mm; diameter, 10 mm; and wall thickness, 3.8 mm) and did not deteriorate during follow-up. In all of them, sonography showed improvement of passage through the pyloric canal within several days, as shown and documented by color Doppler sonography; morphologic changes persisted longer despite clinical improvement.

Conclusions

Sonography, including color Doppler sonography, is a valuable tool for monitoring infants with hypertrophic pyloric stenosis undergoing conservative treatment; however, initial sonograms cannot predict the further course of the disease.

### Vomiting, pyloric mass, and point-of-care ultrasound: diagnostic test accuracy for hypertrophic pyloric stenosis – A meta-analysis [^e34decd5]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis is a common cause of nonbilious vomiting in infants younger than 6 months. Its history, physical examination, and point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) have not been compared for their diagnostic test accuracy.

Objective

The aim of this systematic review was to quantify and compare the diagnostic test accuracy of a history of vomiting, a pyloric mass on palpation, and POCUS.

Methods

We performed three searches of the literature from 1977 to March 2022. We evaluated bias using the QUADAS-2 (Quality Assessment Tool for Diagnostic Accuracy-2) tool. We performed a bivariate analysis.

Results

From 5369 citations, we identified 14 studies meeting our inclusion criteria. We quantified three diagnostic elements: POCUS, a pyloric mass on palpation, and vomiting. We identified five studies that analyzed POCUS, which included 329 patients. POCUS had a sensitivity of 97.7% (95% confidence interval (CI) 93.1–99.3%) and a specificity of 94.1% (95% CI 88.7–97.1%) for detecting pyloric stenosis. We identified six studies that analyzed the presence of a pyloric mass, which included 628 patients. The palpation of a pyloric mass had a sensitivity of 73.5% (95% CI 62.6–82.1%) and a specificity of 97.5% (95% CI 93.8–99.0%). We identified four studies that analyzed vomiting, which included 355 patients. Vomiting had a sensitivity of 91.3% (95% CI 82.1–96.0) and a specificity of 60.8% (95% CI 8.5–96.3). Both POCUS and palpation of a pyloric mass had a high positive likelihood ratio (LR+: 17 and 33, respectively). The LR+ for vomiting was 5.0.

Conclusions

Both POCUS and palpable mass had high specificity and positive LR, whereas vomiting provided the lowest diagnostic test measures.

### Negative exploration for pyloric stenosis – is it preventable? [^bfb83ff0]. BMC Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Methods

The hospital case records of 343 patients who underwent surgical exploration with a presumptive diagnosis of IHPS at the Royal Liverpool Children's Hospital between January 2000 and December 2004 were reviewed. Demographics, clinical findings, preoperative imaging, duration of symptoms, biochemical investigations and operative findings were collected from several sources (case notes, transfer letters, operative reports and computer records). During the period of the study, a defined protocol for diagnosis of IHPS was not used at our centre, and surgical exploration was performed at the discretion of the registrars and consultants based on a variable combination of test feed, US and presence of alkalosis. All recorded test feeds were performed by the duty surgical registrar. A nasogastric tube was used to aspirate the stomach prior to commencing test feeding with the infant in the mother's arms. A test feed was considered positive if it was possible to palpate a pyloric 'olive' during the test while the infant was orally fed with < 50 mls of milk or dioralyte. Visible peristalsis in isolation was not criterion for a positive test feed, as it may be present in gastric or intestinal obstruction. The majority (85.5%) of positive ultrasound reports were accompanied by measurements of canal dimensions. At our centre, an US scan was considered to confirm pyloric stenosis if the length of the pyloric canal exceeded 14 mm and the muscle thickness ≥ 4 mm. Alkalosis was defined as a serum pH ≥ 7.45 and/or base excess (BE) ≥ 2.5.

### Postoperative apnea after pyloromyotomy for infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis [^194af1cc]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our series exhibits a rather high incidence of postoperative apnea after pyloromyotomy (9.84%), consistent with the results of a recent review on IHPS which found postoperative apnea rates between 0.2% and 16%. This wide range is possibly explained by lack of robust studies.

The problem of postoperative apnea in newborns has been recognized long ago when rates as high as 49% have been reported, mainly in the preterm population; the incidence of apnea and bradycardia after anesthesia in term infants has not been described extensively but appears to be less than that of preterm infants, ranging from 0% to 10%. Indeed, the ventilatory response to carbon dioxide (CO 2) increases with advancing postnatal and gestational age, so that the ex-premature population is at higher risk of postoperative apnea than the term population. Postoperative apnea rates similar to the one in our cohort have been reported after general anesthesia in preterm babies operated before 60 weeks of PCA.

Furthermore, an added advantage of sonography is that it enables evaluation of other intra-abdominal viscera and vessels which may be the site of the disease causing the vomiting. The ability to define the stomach and intestines clearly has led to changes in management protocols and in many situations sonography may be the only imaging modality required. The presence of gastric and bowel gas does not necessarily impede the sonographic examination in infants as the gas may be gently pushed aside by applying gentle graded abdominal pressure with the transducer.

In recent years fluoroscopic examinations using contrast material to outline the upper or lower gastrointestinal tract have been used less frequently as the full value of sonography in gastrointestinal imaging has become better understood and more widely used. The main disadvantage of fluoroscopic examinations is the use of ionizing radiation and this should be kept in mind at all times when using this modality, particularly in neonates and infants. A further disadvantage of fluoroscopic contrast examinations of the gastrointestinal tract is that the other viscera and vessels of the abdomen are not delineated as they are with sonography.

An essential reminder is that whichever modality is used (whether it be sonography or a contrast examination under fluoroscopy), meticulous attention to technique is necessary in order to optimize the images in order to obtain the most information from the examination.

In infants with non-bilious vomiting, sonography is the modality of choice as it can easily differentiate a normal pylorus from hypertrophic pyloric stenosis, antral webs, gastric duplications, gastric foveolar hyperplasia and other rarer causes of gastric outlet obstruction. Those infants who continue to vomit even though the initial sonogram reveals a pylorus that is considered normal should be evaluated with follow-up sonograms as hypertrophic pyloric stenosis may sometimes be encountered as an evolving process and its typical features may only be seen on follow-up examination.

### Types of diagnostic errors reported by paediatric emergency providers in a global paediatric emergency care research network [^2bf515c0]. BMJ Open Quality (2023). High credibility.

Definition of diagnostic error: Investigators from our group have successfully operationalised the measurement of diagnostic errors by viewing them as missed opportunities to make a correct or timely diagnosis regardless of patient harm. We provided the following example to assist the providers in describing an instance of a missed opportunity they may have experienced.

Briefcase summary: A 2-month-old male child presented to the ED with non-bilious vomiting for 1 week and failure to thrive. The physical examination revealed a normal appearing infant without obvious dehydration.

Diagnosis and disposition at first ED visit: Gastro-oesophageal reflux and discharged home.

Final, correct diagnosis: Patient came back with persistent vomiting 36 hours later, an ultrasound revealed a hypertrophic pyloric stenosis.

MOID: Although reflux as well as many other aetiologies can cause vomiting, hypertrophic pyloric stenosis should be a differential diagnosis at the initial visit and not obtaining or arranging for an ultrasound abdomen represents an MOID.

Outcomes: The primary outcome was to describe the frequency of conditions that could have been diagnosed at initial or index ED evaluation. The secondary outcomes were descriptions of the contributory factors and patient harm from MOIDs, with stratification and analysed by individual network. We created a categorisation system based on body systems (online supplemental table 1) for index and repeat ED visit complaints and diagnoses. For example, patients presenting with vomiting were categorised as having a gastrointestinal system condition while those presenting with headaches were categorised as having central nervous system conditions. If the patients were diagnosed with acute gastroenteritis at the index ED visit, they were categorised as having a gastrointestinal diagnosis. On repeat ED visit, if they were diagnosed with appendicitis, they were then categorised as having a gastrointestinal system final diagnosis. However, if the patient had a diagnosis of intracranial tumour, then they were categorised as having an oncological condition.

### Helicobacter pylori and infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis: is there a possible relationship? [^9c2f5732]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Recently, it has been suggested that Helicobacter pylori might be a cause of some cases of infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS) in infancy on the basis of its epidemiologic and clinical features. We performed this study to evaluate the possible relationship between IHPS and H. pylori.

Design

In consecutive infants with IHPS, we performed upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with biopsy before pyloromyotomy. The endoscopic appearance of the pylorus was noted to validate endoscopic features of IHPS.

Results

Sixteen infants, 15 male, 14 white, mean age 42 days, range 21 to 104 days, were studied. The index case had chronic active gastritis on biopsy with organisms suspicious for H. pylori. Four others had chronic active gastritis, six more had focal or mild chronic gastritis, five were normal, and none had H. pylori on histology or immune histochemical staining in selected cases. All patients had negative rapid urease test. Most common endoscopic findings of IHPS were thickened prominent asymmetric pyloric folds and pin-hole pylorus that could not be intubated by the pediatric endoscope.

Conclusion

H. pylori was not specifically identified in our patients with IHPS. The presence of H. pylori-like organisms in the gastric mucosa in our index case and finding of chronic active gastritis in several others may indicate the possibility of an acquired infectious etiology for IHPS.

### Predictive factors for time to full enteral feeding after pyloromyotomy for infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis [^75e39c15]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The aim of the study was to evaluate how different parameters in the preoperative, perioperative, and postoperative period affect time to full enteral feeding (TFEF) in children undergoing pyloromyotomy.

Methods

A retrospective study of all children operated for infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis between 2001 and 2017 was conducted. Parameters in demographics and in the preoperative and postoperative period were evaluated against TFEF (hours) using linear regression models.

Results

In the whole cohort of 175 children, mean TFEF was 47 hours with Standard Deviation (SD) of ± 35. In the multivariate model, TFEF decreased with age [beta (B): −0.62; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) −1.05 to −0.19; p = 0.005) and increased with the presence of severe underlying disease (congenital heart defect or syndrome) (B: 26.5; 95% CI 3.3 to 49.7; p = 0.026). Hence, for every day of age, the time to fully fed decreased by 0.6 hour, and the presence of an underlying disease increased the time to fully fed with over one day. TFEF did not seem to be affected by prematurity, weight loss, symptom duration, preoperative acid/base balance or electrolyte values, surgical method, or method of postoperative feeding.

Conclusions

TFEF decreased with higher age and increased in children with a severe underlying disease. These results may be useful in providing adequate parental information regarding what affects TFEF and the length of hospital stay.

### A rare cause of gastric outlet obstruction in the newborn: pyloric ectopic pancreas [^8681d254]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

This report describes a case of symptomatic pyloric ectopic pancreas simulating infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS) in an 1-month-old boy. There are few cases reported in the English-language literature with the same clinical presentation during the neonatal period. Rarely is the entity symptomatic, and it should be kept in mind in differential diagnosis of nonbilious vomiting, especially in neonates. The ectopic pancreas should be removed because of the late complications when found incidentally.

### Acute abdomen in infants of adolescent mothers: diagnostic challenges [^480db78a]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2001). Low credibility.

Caring for children of adolescent parents presents unique challenges. Because adolescent parents may lack parenting skills and knowledge of medical terminology, symptoms of life-threatening illnesses may be misinterpreted. We present two cases of unexpected acute abdomen in young infants with adolescent mothers. The first case involves midgut volvulus, which was discovered during a routine newborn visit. The second case, involving pyloric stenosis, presented a clinical management challenge when the adolescent mother refused diagnostic studies.

Clinical phenotype of FEM1B related NDD

The clinical data of the five individuals are summarized in Table 1 and Figure 1. Each individual was seen in a medical genetics consultation to assess a suspected genetic developmental disorder. Their age at last consultation ranged from 3.5 to 25 years. All individuals were born at term and had normal prenatal ultrasounds. Significant malformations were noted at birth in Individuals 1 and 3, who both presented with talipes equinovarus and congenital heart defects affecting the auricular or ventricular septum, which required surgery in Individual 3. Individual 1 was diagnosed with pyloric stenosis and underwent surgical treatment on day 15. All individuals presented with global developmental delay. The average age at which individuals sat unassisted was 13 months and walk unassisted was 3.8 years. Language acquisition was also delayed, and all five individuals developed mild to moderate intellectual disability. Behavioral abnormalities were observed in four individuals, with features of autism such as stereotypies, rituals, and overstimulation. Strikingly, these four individuals (1 to 4) exhibited significant auto-aggressivity, including self-biting and head banging.

### Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis following persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn: a case report and literature review [^ed479ca4]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Case presentation

The patient was a female neonate born at 38 weeks of gestation, weighing 3140 g. She was delivered to a 34-year-old primigravida uncomplicated mother by emergency cesarean section due to fetal distress following idiopathic oligohydramnios which occurred during the third trimester. At birth, the infant was non-vigorous due to meconium aspiration and required resuscitation using endotracheal intubation and tracheal suctioning. The Apgar scores were 5 and 7 at 1 and 5 min, respectively. She required mechanical ventilation after transfer to the neonatal intensive care unit due to the development of respiratory insufficiency. A chest X-ray revealed bilateral diffused, grossly patchy opacities, which is a typical finding in meconium aspiration syndrome. Moreover, a > 10% difference between pre- and post-ductal saturation of peripheral oxygen, measured by pulse oximetry, persisted despite increased oxygen supplementation and ventilatory support. An echocardiogram revealed a structurally normal heart with marked tricuspid regurgitation, right-to-left shunting through the ductus arteriosus, and suprasystemic pulmonary pressures. Based on the clinical presentation and findings on imaging, a diagnosis of PPHN was made and intensive treatment with high frequency oscillations and inhaled NO were initiated. Subsequently, sildenafil, a specific phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor that enhances NO-mediated vasodilation, and bosentan, an endothelin receptor-inhibitor that increases internal activity of endogenous NO, were added to treatment. The symptoms gradually improved, and the infant was subsequently weaned from inhaled NO and ventilatory support, with extubation performed at 11 days of age.

### Feasibility of emergency physician diagnosis of hypertrophic pyloric stenosis using point-of-care ultrasound: a multi-center case series [^d592514a]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (HPS) is an acute abdominal emergency in infants that often presents to Emergency Departments. The clinical diagnosis of HPS relies on palpation of an olive-sized mass in the right upper quadrant of an infant with a history of projectile vomiting. However, studies have shown that clinicians cannot detect the olive in 11% to 51% of cases. Ultrasonography is the imaging modality of choice to diagnose HPS. HPS has a highly characteristic sonographic appearance that makes it readily identifiable on ultrasound. To our knowledge, there have been no reports documenting the ability of Emergency Physicians to diagnose HPS using point-of-care ultrasound. We present a multi-center case series (n = 8) of HPS diagnosed by Emergency Physician-performed ultrasound. We review the technique of incorporating point-of-care ultrasound into the physical examination of infants with suspected HPS and discuss the possible role of point-of-care ultrasound in the management of these patients.

### Intestinal malrotation as a misdiagnosis of pediatric colchicine resistant familial mediterranean fever [^7e58f755]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Table 3
Differential diagnosis of recurrent vomiting (often with abdominal pain) other than familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) in the pediatric population, by age

a Includes malrotation with midgut volvulus, pyloric stenosis, intussusception, Hirschsprung disease, congenital atresia/stenosis/webs, incarcerated hernia

b Includes urea cycle defects, organic acidemias, fatty acid oxidation defects, disorders of gluconeogenesis in infancy, and porphyria in childhood/adolescence

GERD gastroesophageal reflux, IBD inflammatory bowel disease, PUD peptic ulcer disease

The common causes in each age are marked in bold. Functional gastrointestinal disorders are a common cause of recurrent abdominal pain but without vomiting

Malrotation is an incomplete rotation of the intestine during fetal development. The mesentery, including the superior mesenteric artery, is tethered by a narrow stalk, which can twist around itself, and produce life threatening midgut volvulus, with an acute presentation of small bowel obstruction. Traditionally, intestinal malrotation is considered primarily a disease of infancy with infrequent occurrence beyond the first year of life. However, recent studies demonstrate that the prevalence of malrotation in older children and adults appears to be higher than previously thought. Upper gastrointestinal series is the gold standard imaging test for diagnosis. Surgical intervention is recommended regardless of age, and presentation of volvulus requires an emergency procedure.

In summary, alterative diagnoses to FMF should be considered in cases of atypical attacks as in our patient, even if fulfilling diagnostic criteria and supported partially by a heterozygous mutation in the MEFV gene. In some cases, as we described, the correct diagnosis may represent a surgical or medical emergency requiring prompt treatment.

### Early life events: infants with pyloric stenosis have a higher risk of developing chronic abdominal pain in childhood [^3644423a]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

We hypothesize that children who had pyloric stenosis are at greater risk for developing chronic abdominal pain because this cohort combines various risk factors: an early stressful event, gastric surgery, and perioperative nasogastric tube placement in most cases.

Study Design

This was a case control study of all children diagnosed with pyloric stenosis during infancy (cases) between January 1, 2000, and June 31, 2005, at Children's Memorial Hospital, Chicago. Because of their similar genetic and socioeconomic backgrounds, siblings aged 4 to 20 years without a history of pyloric stenosis were selected as controls. Parents of children with symptoms completed the parental form of the Pediatric GI Symptoms Rome III version questionnaire for both cases and controls. The primary outcome was the prevalence of chronic abdominal pain, and the secondary outcome was the presence of pain-associated functional gastrointestinal disorder (FGID), in accordance with Rome III criteria.

Results

Cases (n = 100; mean age, 7.49 ± 1.43 years; 29 girls) and controls (n = 91; mean age, 9.20 ± 4.19 years; 29 girls) participated in the study. Mean time to follow-up was 7.2 ± 1.6 years. Chronic abdominal pain was significantly more common in cases than in controls (20/80 [25%] vs 5/91 [5.8%]; OR, 4.3; 95% CI, 1.5–12; P = 0.0045). Seven out of 20 subjects (35%) met the Rome III criteria for diagnosis of a pain-associated FGID (3 with irritable bowel syndrome, 2 with functional dyspepsia, and 2 with functional abdominal pain), and 1 patient in the control group (with irritable bowel syndrome) met these criteria (OR, 6.8; 95% CI, 0.82–56; P = 0.043).

Conclusion

We have described a new model to study early life events in infants. Our findings suggest that the presence of pyloric stenosis in infancy and factors involved in its perioperative care represent risk factors in the development of chronic abdominal pain in children at long-term follow-up. This study provides important data to sustain the multifactorial theoretical construct of pain-associated FGID and underscores the importance of early life events in the development of chronic abdominal pain in children.

### The epidemiology of infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis in Sweden 1987–96 [^531c6d10]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2001). Low credibility.

Aims

To find out whether the incidence of infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS) has changed over the past decade, and if so, to investigate possible contributory factors.

Methods

All infants undergoing pyloromyotomy for IHPS in Sweden between 1987 and 1996 were studied. Using the national patient registers the yearly incidence was determined and evaluated in relation to sex, latitude, urbanisation, and type of surroundings by use of a Poisson model.

Results

There was a substantial decline from 2.7/1000 to 0.85/1000 over the time period. The incidence in the south was almost three times greater than in the north.

Conclusion

The declining incidence and geographical difference suggest that environmental factors are of importance in this disorder.

### Perioperative apnea in infants with hypertrophic pyloric stenosis: a systematic review [^844ee0d3]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2020). Medium credibility.

3.6 Apnea and metabolic alkalosis

All described infants with preoperative apnea, including the infant with both pre‐ and postoperative apnea (Table 3; case 3), had hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis. 9, 14, 15, 19, 20, 22 An exception to this was case 5 (Table 2) who presented with metabolic acidosis and shock. 7 Median preoperative serum values of all infants with preoperative apnea are shown in Table 4. In most infants, other causes of preoperative apnea were excluded based on clinical judgment and by the use of additional diagnostics including complete blood workup, urine analysis, chest X‐ray, ECG, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis (Table 2). Abreu et al 22 did not mention whether or not they used additional diagnostics to exclude other causes of respiratory alterations, but repeated polygraphic sleep studies after recovery were completely normal.

TABLE 4
Median laboratory values of infants with preoperative respiratory problems.

Note

Only one of five infants with postoperative apnea had noted hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis. 15 Exact laboratory values at presentation of infants with postoperative apnea were often not available. Most infants received intravenous fluid therapy to correct metabolic derangements and/or dehydration. It is unknown what serum concentrations were required before pyloromyotomy. Although Ein et al 23 aimed at a chloride level of ≥ 90 mmol/L, one of the infants with postoperative apnea had a chloride level of 85 mmol/L before surgery. Andropoulos et al 15 described preoperative serum electrolyte levels of sodium > 137 mmol/L, potassium > 4.7 mmol/L, chloride > 101 mmol/L, and hemoglobin > 7.2 mmol/L in their infants. Other factors, which could induce postoperative apnea as anemia, hypoglycemia, sepsis, and neurological disorders, were ruled out.

### Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis following persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn: a case report and literature review [^f3609f4f]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Oral feeds with breast milk were started at 12 days of age. However, 3 days later, the infant developed non-bilious vomiting after feeding, which increased in frequency in the following days. The daily clinical examination was unremarkable and no mass was palpable in the abdomen. Plain abdominal X-ray at 17 and 19 days of age showed a dilated stomach. A contrast study was not performed. At 20 days of age, abdominal ultrasonography (US) revealed a hypertrophic pylorus, with a 5–6-mm mural thickening over a length of 18 mm, confirming the diagnosis of HPS. At this time, the plasma arginine level was 53.3 μmol/L (reference range: 53.6–133.6 μmol/L). The parents selected conservative treatment for their child, and atropine therapy was started. Atropine was administered intravenously at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg/day, which was divided equally by the number of oral feedings. Frequency of vomiting did not decrease in 3 days, and the dose was increased to 0.13 mg/kg/day. Subsequently, the frequency of vomiting decreased, but significant gastric residuals continued for more than 7 days after the start of atropine therapy. Hypertrophic pyloric muscle remained unchanged on repeated US. We considered the efficacy of the treatment was clinically unsatisfactory referring to previous studies. Then, transdermal nitroglycerin (5 mg/day) was added to the treatment at 29 days of age. Thereafter, the infant tolerated full enteral feeds, with no further vomiting, and oral feeding was successfully re-introduced. At 34 days of age, atropine was changed to oral administration at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg/day. Transdermal nitroglycerin was ceased over a day after that (the total dosing period was 7 days). Subsequently, the infant remained well and was discharged home at 43 days of age.

The final regression model was tested with and without the weight included and there was little difference in the beta for age (−0.62, 95% CI −1.05 to −0.19 and −0.61, 95% CI −0.98 to −0.25, respectively). When checking for heteroscedasticity, the residuals of the final regression model seemed to have constant variance (data not shown).

### Patient with partial trisomy 9q and learning disability but no pyloric stenosis [^2593863b]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

Partial trisomy of the long arm of chromosome 9 represents a very rare and heterogeneous group of chromosomal aberrations. Associated clinical features include learning disability and pyloric stenosis. We present the first patient to be reported with a duplication of the chromosome region 9q22.1→ q33. The patient (female, age 17 years) presented with growth retardation, microcephaly, facial dysmorphia, oesophageal atresia, aortic stenosis, ventricular septal defect, atrial septal defect II, hypothyroidism, and learning disability, but no pyloric stenosis. A review of all cases of partial trisomy 9q reported in the literature demonstrates that learning disability is a characteristic feature of this group of chromosomal aberrations. However, there are cases of duplications of the same chromosome 9 material, with and without pyloric stenosis. This study provides new information for future genetic counselling, especially in cases of prenatal diagnosis of partial trisomy 9q.

### Predictive factors for time to full enteral feeding after pyloromyotomy for infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis [^ff7769b3]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Study design

This study is an institution-based retrospective study. Primary outcome was duration (hours) to full enteral feeding. This was defined by the time from operation to journal notes either stated 'fully fed' or describing correct amount of food intake without emesis. Independent variables were preoperative parameters such as demographical data, type of feeding (breastmilk/formula), symptoms and blood tests; surgical data such as method of operation; and postoperative parameters including method of feeding and complications. Prematurity was defined as a gestational age shorter than 37 weeks. Age at operation was corrected for prematurity. Small for gestational age was defined as a weight below the 10th percentile for the gestational age. Children with congenital heart disease (CHD) requiring surgery, and syndromes were included in the 'severe underlying disease' group. The cut-offs used for ultrasound were pyloric muscle thickness of 4 mm or more, and pyloric channel length of 16 mm or more. In infants small than 3 weeks the cut-off for thickness was 3.5 mm. Blood samples were taken from venous blood to perform analysis of sodium, potassium, chloride, base excess, pH, pCO 2, pO 2, hemoglobin, and liver function tests including alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, and bilirubin (total). Reference intervals for all analyses were age specific and followed international standards. The reference intervals for (total) bilirubin were: < 2 days of age: < 100 μmol/L; 2–6 days of age: < 200 μmol/L; 7–20 days of age: < 100μmol/L; 21–29 days: < 50 μmol/L; and > 1 month of age: < 22 μmol/L. Complications included were postoperative infection and reoperation. Length of postoperative hospital stay (hours) was counted from operation until discharge.

### Pyloric stenosis in a newborn baby with polycystic kidneys [^10a228fe]. Journal of Perinatology (2007). Low credibility.

Patients with infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS) have an increased incidence of renal anomalies. Association of IHPS and polycystic kidney disease (PKD) has been reported in three case histories. It is uncertain whether the association of PKD and IHPS is due to genetics, a pathophysiological link or a chance phenomenon. One hypothesis linking the two conditions is nitric oxide synthetase (NOS) deficiency. NOS deficiency leads to lack of locally available nitric oxide causing a failure of smooth muscle relaxation. It is therefore plausible that NOS deficiency plays a part in the pathogenesis of pyloric stenosis, hypertension and cyst development in autosomal-dominant PKD.

RESULTS

Characteristics of Study Population

Overall, 171 patients were included in the analysis; 79 patients (46.2%) underwent POCUS only, 50 patients (29.2%) underwent POCUS followed by RADUS, and 42 patients (24.5%) underwent RADUS only (Fig. 1). The clinical features of the patients are presented in Table 1. The median age was 34 days, and 114 patients (66.7%) visited the ED during the radiologists' on-call hours when RADUS could not be performed immediately.

Clinical Features of the Study Population

Finally, 41 patients (24.0%) were diagnosed with HPS, whereas 130 patients (76.0%) did not have HPS. The probable diagnoses of non-HPS patients in the ED included gastroesophageal reflux, gastroenteritis, ileus, or sepsis. Compared with the non-HPS patients, HPS patients had a male predominance (85.4% vs 56.9%, P = 0.001) and relatively longer duration of illness (168 vs 24 hours, P < 0.001); however, other variables were not significantly different between those with and without HPS.

### Advances in paediatric gastroenterology [^da01abf8]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

Recent developments in paediatric gastrointestinal surgery have focused on minimally invasive surgery, the accumulation of high-quality clinical evidence, and scientific research. The benefits of minimally invasive surgery for common disorders like appendicitis and hypertrophic pyloric stenosis are all supported by good clinical evidence. Although minimally invasive surgery has been extended to neonatal surgery, it is difficult to establish its role for neonatal disorders such as oesophageal atresia and biliary atresia through clinical trials because of the rarity of these disorders. Advances in treatments for biliary atresia and necrotising enterocolitis have been achieved through specialisation, multidisciplinary management, and multicentre collaboration in research; similarly robust clinical evidence for other rare gastrointestinal disorders is needed. As more neonates with gastrointestinal diseases survive into adulthood, their long-term sequelae will also need evidence-based multidisciplinary care. Identifying cures for long-term problems of a complex developmental anomaly such as Hirschsprung's disease will rely on unravelling its pathogenesis through genetics and the development of stem-cell therapy.

### Use of macrolides in mother and child and risk of infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis: nationwide cohort study [^2602ee26]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Macrolide antibiotics are widely used in the treatment of upper and lower respiratory tract infections and sexually transmitted diseases. Infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS) is the most common condition requiring surgery during the first months of life, where infants, typically between 3 and 12 weeks old, present with progressively worsening vomiting due to hypertrophy of the pyloric muscle. Following a decline in incidence of this condition in many countries from the beginning of the 1990s, the current estimate for IHPS is around 1 to 2 per 1000 births.

IHPS has been associated with genetics, boys, family history, and birth order (first born), and with environmental factors such as bottle feeding. Moreover, infants treated with the macrolide erythromycin during the first two weeks after birth are at increased risk of IHPS. It is, however, unclear whether the increased risk associated with macrolide use extends beyond these two weeks or whether the infantile gut is particularly susceptible during the two weeks after birth. As an up to 10-fold increase in risk of IHPS has been reported after use of macrolides in infants it has been debated whether the risk might also be increased by maternal use. Although the evidence is sparse, macrolides are excreted in breast milk at low levels and are thus generally considered safe during breast feeding. A study of maternal postnatal macrolide use reported twofold to threefold increased odds of IHPS, but the association was not statistically significant and was only based on three exposed cases. Studies of macrolide use during pregnancy and IHPS report heterogeneous results but suggest a possible modestly increased risk with use in late pregnancy.

In a nationwide register based cohort study of approximately one million liveborn singletons and their mothers, we assessed the risk of IHPS after exposure to macrolides in utero and after postnatal use in both mothers and infants.

### Differences in outcomes based on sex for pediatric patients undergoing pyloromyotomy [^1cf2b5f1]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Males and females are known to have varied responses to medical interventions. Our study aimed to determine the effect of sex on surgical outcomes after pyloromyotomy.

Materials and Methods

Using the Kids' Inpatient Database for the years 2003–2012, we performed a serial, cross-sectional analysis of a nationally representative sample of all patients aged < 1 y who underwent pyloromyotomy for hypertrophic pyloric stenosis. The primary predictor of interest was sex. Outcomes included mortality, in-hospital complications, cost, and length of stay. Regression models were adjusted by race, age group, comorbidity, complications, and whether operation was performed on the day of admission with region and year fixed effects.

Results

Of 48,834 weighted operations, 81.8% were in males and 18.2% were in females. The most common reported race was white (47.3%) and most of the patients were ≥ 29 days old (72.5%). There was no difference in the odds of postoperative complications, but females had a significantly longer length of stay (incidence rate ratio, 1.28; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.18–1.39; P ≤ 0.01), higher cost (5%, 95% CI, 1.02–1.08; P ≤ 0.01), and higher odds of mortality (odds ratio, 3.26; 95% CI, 1.52–6.98; P ≤ 0.01).

Conclusions

Our study demonstrated that females had worse outcomes after pyloromyotomy compared with males. These findings are striking and are important to consider when treating either sex to help set physician and family expectations perioperatively. Further studies are needed to determine why such differences exist and to develop targeted treatment strategies for both females and males with pyloric stenosis.

### Population-level surgical outcomes for infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis [^aea763ac]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

Determine national outcomes for pyloromyotomy; how these are affected by: (i) surgical approach (open/laparoscopic), or (ii) centre type/volume and establish potential benchmarks of quality.

Methods

Hospital Episode Statistics data were analysed for admissions 2002–2011. Data presented as median (IQR).

Results

9686 infants underwent pyloromyotomy (83% male). Surgery was performed in 22 specialist (SpCen) and 39 nonspecialist centres (NonSpCen). The proportion treated in SpCen increased linearly by 0.4%/year (r = 0.76, p = 0.01). Annual case volume in SpCen vs. NonSpCen was 40 (24–53) vs. 1 (0–3). Time to surgery was shorter in SpCen (1day [1, 2] vs. 2 [1–3]), but total stay equal (4days [3–6]). 137 (1.4%) had complications requiring reoperation (wound problem 0.6%; repeat pyloromyotomy 0.5% and perforation, bleeding or obstruction 0.2%): pooled rates were similar between SpCen and NonSpCen (1.4% vs. 1.6%, p = 0.52). Three NonSpCen had > 5% reoperations (within 99.8% C. I. as small denominators). There was no relationship between reoperation and centre volume. Laparoscopic pyloromyotomy had increased risk of repeat pyloromyotomy (OR 2.28 [1.14–4.57], p = 0.029).

Conclusions

Pyloric stenosis surgery shifted from centres local to patients, but outcomes were unaffected by centre type/volume. Modest reported benefits of laparoscopy appear offset by increased reoperations. Quality benchmarks could be set for reoperation < 4%.

Type Of Study

Treatment Study.

Level Of Evidence

Level III.

### Predictive factors for time to full enteral feeding after pyloromyotomy for infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis [^a3bdb948]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

From 2001 to 2017, a total of 214 children were diagnosed and operated on for IHPS. A total of 39 (18%) patients were excluded; 25 for missing data, 11 for non-existing data record, 2 for non-isolated pyloromyotomy, and 1 for wrong diagnosis; leaving a total of 175 children included in the study (figure 1).

Figure 1
Flow chart of inclusion and exclusion of children operated for infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS) 2001–2017.

The included cohort consisted of 148 (85%) boys, with a mean corrected age of 37 days, a mean weight of 3925 g, 24 (14%) of which were premature, and 12 (7%) of which had a severe underlying disease (online supplementary table 1). Median duration of symptoms was 4 days (IQR: 7); 128 patients (74%) experienced weight loss; and increased bilirubin was seen in 25 patients (14%) (table 1).

Table 1
Demographics, preoperative data and surgical method in 175 children with infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis

Mean TFEF for the whole cohort was 47 ± 35 hours and mean length of postoperative hospital stay was 66 ± 44 hours. The majority of children (88%) were fed according to a feeding schedule. No child required intravenous nutrition. There were seven children(4%) presented with postoperative complications, of which four required reoperation (table 2).

Table 2
Postoperative data and outcome in 175 children operated for infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis

In the univariate analysis, age, weight, severe underlying disease increased bilirubin level, and duration of symptoms were found to affect TFEF (table 3). In the multivariate analysis, only age (B: −0.62 (95% CI −1.05 to −0.19), p = 0.005) (figure 2) and severe underlying disease (B: 26.5 (95% CI 3.3 to 49.7), p = 0.026) remained as variables significantly affecting TFEF (table 4). Hence, for every day of age, the time to fully fed decreased with 0.6 hour, and the presence of an underlying disease increased the time to fully fed with over 1 day. TFEF did not seem to be affected by prematurity, preoperative weight loss, symptom duration, preoperative acid/base balance or electrolyte values, surgical method, or method of postoperative feeding (tables 3 and 4).

### Incidental finding of thyroglossal duct cyst in a neonate during endotracheal intubation: a case report [^4252516d]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

This was a male baby born at 40 weeks of gestational age by caesarian section after a failed labor induction, weighing 3450 g. Fetal ultrasonography (US) revealed left renal pelvis dilatation and borderline cerebral ventriculomegaly, but the baby was completely asymptomatic and discharged after birth. An US performed two weeks later confirmed the diagnosis of left hydronephrosis (IV grade), and dilatation of cerebral ventricles at the upper limit of normal ranges.

At 21 days of life the patient was taken to the emergency room for recurrent projectile vomits after each breastfeed and weight loss. US examination confirmed the suspect of hypertrophic pyloric stenosis, and the baby was admitted to the surgical ward and taken to the operating room the next day.

During orotracheal intubation, the anesthetist perceived the presence of solid swelling on the midline of the neck (Fig. 1). An ultrasound was then performed in the operating room and revealed a 2 × 2 cm cyst filled with anechoic fluid and delimited by thin walls; the thyroid was normal. Despite the patient's age, the finding was compatible with a TDC, and the decision was to proceed with the cyst removal, after the pyloromyotomy, to prevent future episodes of inflection and to avoid another surgical session. After an anesthesiologist and surgical team discussion, an open pyloromyotomy was performed with a small supraumbilical incision according to Bianchi. The procedure was completed without issues and the abdominal wall closed in layer with absorbable sutures.

### Neonatal community-acquired raoultella ornithinolytica septicemia: a case report and review of the literature [^f51e8945]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Raoultella ornithinolytica is an opportunistic, aquaphilic and Gram-negative bacterium. Immune deficiency states and indwelling catheters provide a basis for most of the infections arising. R. ornithinolytica septicemia (ROS) is extremely rare in neonates but can be life threatening. Community-acquired ROS has not been described in neonates before. The diagnosis of neonatal septicemia is occasionally complicated by unusual clinical presentations. Pyloric stenosis is manifested by projectile, nonbilious vomiting and late findings, including weight loss, dehydration and electrolyte abnormalities beyond 4–6 weeks old. Community-acquired neonatal septicemia symptoms can sometimes be confused with symptoms of gastrointestinal obstructions in patients without risk factors for sepsis. Early diagnosis and appropriate antibiotics are essentials for a good prognosis in neonatal septicemia. Herein, we present a novel case of community-acquired ROS with an unusual presentation in a term infant and a review of the literature about ROS in the neonatal period.

### Gastric outlet obstruction in children: an overview with report of jodhpur disease and sharma's classification [^de839413]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Background/Purpose

Gastric outlet obstruction (GOO) is overwhelmingly described as infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis that overshadows other causes; thereby, there is a need to develop an elaborate and comprehensive classification. We present the same and establish a new disease called primary acquired gastric outlet obstruction during infancy and childhood that was reported for the first time by us in 1997, reviewing the literature published since then, with report of our new cases.

Methods

Eight patients of this disease presented at our center from 1996 to May 2008, and these were analyzed epidemiologically and clinically. Other reports published in literature were compared, and all reported patients were compiled.

Results

All 8 cases presented at age ranging from 1 month to 6 years, with mean age of 2.9 years; there was predilection for male sex (male, 7; female, 1). Presenting symptoms and signs were nonbilious vomiting, weight loss, dehydration, dyselectrolytemia, abdominal pain, and visible gastric peristalsis. Upper gastrointestinal contrast study showed large stomach and increased gastric emptying time. Endoscopy displayed normal stomach without intraluminal lesion. Exploration revealed a dilated stomach, without any pyloric muscular hypertrophy, scarring, inflammation, or obstruction externally or intraluminally. Result of histopathologic examination was normal. All patients except 1 (died of unrelated cause) were cured by Heineke-Mikulicz pyloroplasty.

Conclusions

These patients represent a new disease entity designated as primary acquired gastric outlet obstruction during infancy and childhood. Author's classification is complete and scientific, encompassing all rare causes of GOO. We nickname this idiopathic variety of GOO the Jodhpur disease, the place of the first cases.

### Co-occurrence of infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis and congenital heart defects: a nationwide cohort study [^dd2fc64c]. Pediatric Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Recent studies suggest that infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS) and congenital heart defects (CHDs) may share some genetic risk factors, but little is known about the co-occurrence of the two conditions in patients.

Methods

Our study cohort included 2,212,756 persons born in Denmark 1977–2013. We identified patients with IHPS and CHD in the National Patient Register. Using log-linear Poisson regression, we estimated the (incidence) rate ratios (RRs) comparing the rate of IHPS among children with a CHD diagnosis (exposed) and the rate among those without such a diagnosis.

Results

Twenty-seven thousand three hundred and fifty-seven children in the cohort were diagnosed with CHD out of whom 85 developed IHPS (RR = 2.62, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.09–3.22]). The results were similar for those with and without other congenital malformations, for preterm and term deliveries, and for both sexes. There was, however, a significant effect of calendar period (P = 0.003). In the period 1977–1996, the RR of IHPS given a CHD diagnosis was 1.96 (95% CI 1.41–2.64); in the period 1997–2014, the RR was 3.75 (95% CI 2.74–4.99).

Conclusion

CHD was associated with an increased risk of IHPS. Further research is needed to delineate molecular-level mechanisms that may affect both conditions.

### Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis following persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn: a case report and literature review [^fa123306]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Although persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) and infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (HPS) are both well-known diseases that occur in early infancy, PPHN complicated by HPS is rare. As nitric oxide (NO) is an important mediator of biological functions, on both the vascular endothelium and smooth muscle cells, the decreased production of NO might play a role in the pathogenesis of both PPHN and HPS. We present the case of a neonate who developed HPS following PPHN, including a detailed review on research published to date, and we discuss the pathogenesis of PPHN and HPS.

Case presentation

A female neonate born at 38 weeks of gestation, weighing 3140 g, developed PPHN due to meconium aspiration syndrome. Intensive treatment with high frequency oscillations and inhaled NO were initiated, and sildenafil and bosentan were added. She gradually recovered. At 15 days of age, the patient developed recurrent vomiting after feeding and the diagnosis of HPS was made. Intravenous atropine therapy was started at 20 days of age, but the efficacy was clinically unsatisfactory. The coadministration with transdermal nitroglycerin improved the symptoms, and oral feeding was successfully re-introduced.

Conclusions

Our patient recovered from both PPHN and HPS using NO-related medications. A decrease in NO synthesis is likely to be a common pathway for PPHN and HPS.
