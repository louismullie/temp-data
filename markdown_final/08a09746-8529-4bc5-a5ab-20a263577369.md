## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what "BCG" means. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the exact expansion of the acronym. Then, I should verify the biological origin and how the organism was attenuated. Next, I'll review the historical purpose and current licensed indications. After that, I will clarify the dual modern clinical uses (vaccine versus intravesical therapy) to avoid confusion. Then, I should examine efficacy nuances and limitations, including strain and route issues. Next, I will consider broader immunologic effects and safety. Finally, I will synthesize a precise, clinician-facing definition.

> Let me first confirm the acronym itself. "BCG" stands for Bacillus Calmette‑Guérin, named after Albert Calmette and Camille Guérin, who developed the strain in the early 20th century.

> I need to check the biological origin to be sure I'm not overstating anything. BCG is a live, attenuated strain of Mycobacterium bovis that lost large genomic regions encoding virulence factors during 1908–1921 serial passage on culture media, which underpins its safety profile as a vaccine organism [^115HJ2Wk].

> Next, I should review the historical purpose. BCG was conceived and remains the only licensed vaccine against tuberculosis, providing strong, durable protection against severe childhood forms such as miliary and meningeal TB, while protection against pulmonary TB — especially in adults — is variable, though infant BCG still reduces TB disease and mortality risk in contact cohorts [^1123Eez7].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about clinical usage; I should clarify the dual modern meaning. In current medical practice, "BCG" refers both to the BCG vaccine for TB prevention and to intravesical BCG immunotherapy for non‑muscle‑invasive bladder cancer, with the latter using BCG LIVE preparations instilled into the bladder; importantly, the FDA labels make clear that intravesical BCG is not a vaccine for cancer prevention and is distinct from BCG Vaccine used for TB prophylaxis [^1165UDwU].

> I should confirm the scope and impact to avoid overgeneralization. BCG is the most widely used vaccine globally and is credited with saving tens of millions of lives over the past century, reflecting its central public health role despite imperfect efficacy against adult pulmonary TB.

> Let me consider the key limitations and what might modify effectiveness. Protection against adult pulmonary TB varies by geography and over time, potentially influenced by differing BCG strains, timing and intensity of exposure, and host and environmental factors; attempts to boost BCG with MVA85A have not shown consistent benefit, and alternative delivery routes such as respiratory or intravenous administration are under exploration to improve lung-specific immunity and durability of protection [^114FkQuB] [^112Pvzkx] [^117TuSwX] [^113vnS9S].

> Next, I should review broader immunologic significance, but wait, let me verify the strength of evidence. Beyond TB, BCG can induce trained innate immunity with heterologous benefits, including reductions in neonatal mortality in randomized trials and measurable innate immune reprogramming in adults, although off‑target protection against specific viral outcomes like COVID‑19 has shown mixed results across trials [^112pGz9f] [^113LC4ZM] [^1134HSeQ] [^116C61ew].

> I need to ensure safety nuances are not overlooked. As a live vaccine, BCG can cause localized or disseminated infection in immunocompromised hosts and, when used intravesically, may rarely cause systemic BCG infection or sepsis; FDA guidance emphasizes delaying instillation after traumatic urologic procedures and close post‑instillation monitoring for systemic symptoms [^1134HSeQ] [^1165UDwU].

> Let me synthesize the definition carefully — and I should double‑check wording to avoid redundancy. In short, "BCG" means Bacillus Calmette‑Guérin: a live‑attenuated Mycobacterium bovis preparation developed in the early 20th century that serves as the only licensed vaccine for tuberculosis — especially effective against severe pediatric TB — and, separately, as intravesical immunotherapy for non‑muscle‑invasive bladder cancer; it has variable efficacy against adult pulmonary TB, can induce trained innate immune effects, and carries live‑vaccine safety considerations in specific populations [^1134HSeQ] [^1138vDqZ] [^1165UDwU]. Wait, I just said "historically pivotal pivotal" in my head — that's repetitive; let me restate more precisely: historically pivotal as the sole TB vaccine and uniquely repurposed as bladder cancer immunotherapy, BCG remains widely used with well‑characterized benefits, limitations, and safety precautions [^1134HSeQ] [^1138vDqZ] [^1165UDwU].

BCG stands for **Bacillus Calmette-Guérin** [^1134HSeQ], a live attenuated vaccine derived from Mycobacterium bovis, primarily used to prevent severe childhood tuberculosis and as intravesical immunotherapy for non-muscle invasive bladder cancer [^1138vDqZ]. It is most effective against **miliary and meningeal TB** in children [^1134HSeQ], with variable protection against adult pulmonary TB [^117TuSwX], and is generally safe but contraindicated in immunocompromised individuals due to risk of disseminated infection [^1134HSeQ] [^1165UDwU].

---

## Historical background and development

BCG was developed by Albert Calmette and Camille Guérin at the Pasteur Institute in Lille, France, from 1908 to 1921 by serial passaging of Mycobacterium bovis, leading to attenuation [^115HJ2Wk]. The first human use was in 1921; since then, BCG has become the **most widely used vaccine globally** [^1134HSeQ], with over 100 million doses administered annually [^1138vDqZ].

---

## Mechanism of action

BCG induces both innate and adaptive immune responses [^1134HSeQ], activating macrophages, dendritic cells, and T lymphocytes, and promoting cytokine production — most notably interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) [^111A9kvg]. It also induces **trained immunity** [^113LC4ZM], a form of innate immune memory that enhances responses to subsequent infections, including non-mycobacterial pathogens [^1138vDqZ].

---

## Clinical applications

### Tuberculosis prevention

- **Primary use**: BCG is primarily used to prevent severe forms of tuberculosis, particularly miliary and meningeal TB in children [^1134HSeQ] [^1123Eez7].

- **Efficacy**: The vaccine's efficacy against pulmonary TB in adults is variable, ranging from 0% to 80% [^1134HSeQ], depending on geographic location, environmental factors, and genetic differences among populations [^117TuSwX].

- **Global use**: BCG is included in the World Health Organization's Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) [^1134HSeQ] and is administered at birth in countries with high TB prevalence [^114e5TSp].

---

### Bladder cancer treatment

BCG is the **standard intravesical immunotherapy** for non–muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC), significantly reducing recurrence and progression rates [^1138vDqZ] [^114VRMuU]. Its antitumor effect involves activating the immune system — particularly macrophages, neutrophils, and T cells — leading to tumor cell destruction [^111hGaoT] [^115zNw38].

---

## Safety and side effects

- **Common reactions**: Local reactions at the injection site, such as redness, swelling, and ulceration, are common but generally mild [^1134HSeQ].

- **Serious complications**: Disseminated BCG infection can occur, particularly in immunocompromised individuals, and may require prolonged antibiotic treatment [^1165UDwU] [^114cWNGx].

- **Contraindications**: BCG vaccination is contraindicated in individuals with severe immunodeficiency, including HIV infection, and in pregnant women [^1134HSeQ].

---

## Global impact and public health significance

BCG vaccination has significantly reduced the incidence of severe childhood tuberculosis worldwide [^1134HSeQ] [^1123Eez7]. Its non-specific effects — including reduced mortality from other infectious diseases — have been documented in several studies [^1134HSeQ] [^112pGz9f]. In oncology, BCG remains the **most effective immunotherapy for NMIBC**, significantly improving patient outcomes [^1138vDqZ] [^114VRMuU].

---

## Current research and future directions

- **New vaccines**: Research is ongoing to develop new TB vaccines with improved efficacy, particularly against pulmonary TB in adults [^1134HSeQ] [^1167xg5h].

- **COVID-19**: Studies are investigating the potential role of BCG vaccination in reducing the severity of COVID-19 through its non-specific immune effects [^116C61ew] [^116H7Qjq].

- **Bladder cancer**: Research continues to optimize BCG therapy for bladder cancer, including combination therapies and novel delivery methods [^111hGaoT] [^115zNw38].

---

BCG is a **live attenuated vaccine** derived from Mycobacterium bovis, primarily used to prevent severe childhood tuberculosis and as intravesical immunotherapy for non-muscle invasive bladder cancer [^1134HSeQ] [^1138vDqZ]. It has significantly reduced childhood TB incidence and improved bladder cancer outcomes, with ongoing research exploring new vaccines and potential roles in other diseases [^1123Eez7] [^1167xg5h].

### Myths and mysteries surrounding bacillus Calmette-Guérin therapy for bladder cancer [^114VRMuU]. European Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Intravesical therapy with bacillus Calmette-Guérin has proven effects for reducing recurrence, progression, and death from non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer. These advantages are seen mainly when appropriate maintenance therapy is used for 1–3 years in the context of appropriate patient selection, tumor management, and symptom support for potential side effects.

### Tice BCG [^1165UDwU]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Warnings**: BCG LIVE (TICE BCG) is not a vaccine for the prevention of cancer. BCG Vaccine, not BCG LIVE (TICE BCG), should be used for the prevention of tuberculosis. For vaccination use, refer to BCG Vaccine prescribing information.

- **Handling precautions**: TICE BCG is an infectious agent. Physicians using this product should be familiar with the literature on the prevention and treatment of BCG-related complications and should be prepared in such emergencies to contact an infectious disease specialist with experience in treating the infectious complications of intravesical BCG. The treatment of the infectious complications of BCG requires long-term, multiple-drug antibiotic therapy. Special culture media are required for mycobacteria, and physicians administering intravesical BCG or those caring for these patients should have these media readily available.

- **BCG infection**: Instillation of TICE BCG in the presence of an actively bleeding mucosa may promote systemic BCG infection. Treatment should be postponed for at least one week following transurethral resection, biopsy, traumatic catheterization, or gross hematuria.

- **Systemic BCG reaction**: Deaths have been reported as a result of systemic BCG infection and sepsis. Patients should be monitored for the presence of symptoms and signs of toxicity after each intravesical treatment. Febrile episodes with flu-like symptoms lasting more than 72 hours, fever ≥ 103°F, systemic manifestations increasing in intensity with repeated instillations, or persistent abnormalities of liver function tests suggest systemic BCG infection and may require antibiotic therapy.

### 100 years of Mycobacterium bovis bacille Calmette-Guérin [^1134HSeQ]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Mycobacterium bovis bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG), an experimental vaccine designed to protect cattle from bovine tuberculosis, was administered for the first time to a newborn baby in Paris in 1921. Over the past century, BCG has saved tens of millions of lives and has been given to more humans than any other vaccine. It remains the sole tuberculosis vaccine licensed for use in humans. BCG provides long-lasting strong protection against miliary and meningeal tuberculosis in children, but it is less effective for the prevention of pulmonary tuberculosis, especially in adults.

Evidence mainly from the past two decades suggests that BCG has non-specific benefits against non-tuberculous infections in newborn babies and in older adults, and offers immunotherapeutic benefit in certain malignancies such as non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. However, as a live attenuated vaccine, BCG can cause localized or disseminated infections in immunocompromised hosts, which can also occur following intravesical installation of BCG for the treatment of bladder cancer.

The legacy of BCG includes fundamental discoveries about tuberculosis-specific and non-specific immunity and the demonstration that tuberculosis is a vaccine-preventable disease, providing a foundation for new vaccines to hasten tuberculosis elimination.

### Nontuberculous mycobacteria and heterologous immunity to tuberculosis [^112F9ugM]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

The development of an improved tuberculosis (TB) vaccine is a high worldwide public health priority. Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG), the only licensed TB vaccine, provides variable efficacy against adult pulmonary TB, but the reasons for this variability remain unclear. Humans are regularly exposed to non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) that inhabit soil and water reservoirs, with diverse geographical variations globally. Immunologic cross-reactivity may explain the disparate outcomes of BCG vaccination and susceptibility to TB disease. Evidence supporting this hypothesis is increasing, yet challenging to obtain due to a lack of reliable research tools.

In this review, we describe the progress and bottlenecks in research on NTM epidemiology, immunology, and heterologous immunity to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). With ongoing efforts to develop new vaccines for TB, understanding the impact of NTM on vaccine efficacy may become a critical determinant of success.

### History of bacillus Calmette-Guerin and bladder cancer: an immunotherapy success story [^116vd6N5]. The Journal of Urology (2008). Low credibility.

We review how the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccine evolved to become a standard therapy for superficial bladder cancer.

- **Purpose**: We reviewed the historical literature describing the origin of the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccine as an anticancer agent and its singular success as the most effective immunotherapy used against a human neoplasm.

- **Results**: The association between tuberculosis and cancer, and the demonstration that Bacillus Calmette-Guerin invoked immunological reactivity, inhibiting tumor growth in experimental animal models, led to clinical trials showing that intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Guerin eradicated and prevented recurrence of superficial bladder tumors.

- **Conclusions**: For the last 3 decades, Bacillus Calmette-Guerin therapy has remained the most effective local therapy for superficial bladder cancer, an outstanding example of successful translational medicine in urology.

### Early BCG-Denmark and neonatal mortality among infants weighing < 2500 g: A randomized controlled trial [^112pGz9f]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). High credibility.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has recently reviewed the potential nonspecific effects of vaccines, including both observational and randomized studies. It was concluded that the BCG vaccine almost halved the mortality rate and that the effect, if true, was unlikely to be explained solely by protection against tuberculosis. Trials I and II were included in the review. The present trial corroborates the results of the WHO review. A recent randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the BCG vaccine in Denmark showed no effect on all-cause hospitalizations. However, among BCG-vaccinated mothers, randomization to BCG vaccination of the newborn was associated with a significant 35% reduction in hospital admissions for infectious diseases, whereas there was no effect of the BCG vaccine in infants of BCG-unvaccinated mothers (unpublished data).

Because most mothers in Guinea-Bissau are BCG vaccinated, but only 17% were vaccinated in Denmark, it could be speculated that differences in maternal BCG priming explain the difference in results. A recent study from Uganda found that children of mothers with a BCG vaccine scar had stronger nonspecific proinflammatory responses after BCG vaccination. Recent observational studies from Greenland and Finland, where most mothers were BCG vaccinated, found BCG to be associated with reductions in hospitalizations for infants under 3 months of age, but there was no effect in older children who would have received other vaccines.

We had hypothesized a 45% reduction in neonatal mortality rate. There are several possible reasons why we observed a less pronounced effect in the present trial compared to previous findings.

### Efficacy of BCG vaccination against respiratory tract infections in older adults during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic [^116H7Qjq]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

The data presented in this study do not support the hypothesis that BCG vaccination reduces the incidence of RTIs during the COVID-19 pandemic in older adults living in a Western European country. Similarly, no effect was observed on the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection or any of the other secondary clinical endpoints. Exaggerated inflammatory reactions, characterized by an increased concentration of circulating cytokines, have been reported to contribute to COVID-19 severity. We argue that when the BCG vaccine is administered to a healthy individual, it will elicit a fast and robust immune response that reduces viremia and levels of systemic inflammation, as demonstrated in a previous BCG vaccination study involving young adults. Supporting this, the study's results indicate that BCG vaccination is safe in older adults, as no differences in the incidence of serious adverse events were observed between the BCG vaccine and placebo groups. BCG-vaccinated individuals were not more frequently admitted to the hospital due to SARS-CoV-2 infection, indicating that recent BCG vaccination is not associated with increased COVID-19-related morbidity in older adults.

In contrast to our findings, several smaller studies performed in Indonesia, Japan, South Africa, and Greece observed a protective effect of the BCG vaccine on the incidence of RTIs in adults. The difference in effects between our study and others may have several causes, such as the difference between first vaccination with the BCG vaccine and revaccination.

### Immunogenicity of Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens in Mycobacterium bovis BCG-vaccinated and M. bovis-infected cattle [^111tFqKn]. Infection and Immunity (2006). Low credibility.

The development of novel vaccine strategies supplementing Mycobacterium bovis BCG (BCG) constitutes an urgent research challenge. To identify potential subunit vaccine candidates, we have tested a series of eight recently identified Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens in M. bovis-infected and BCG-vaccinated cattle. These antigens were characterized based on their ability to induce in vitro gamma interferon responses in infected or BCG-vaccinated calves. We established a hierarchy of these antigens based on how frequently they were recognized in both groups of animals. Notably, we prioritized frequently recognized proteins like Rv0287, Rv1174, and Rv1196 for future evaluation as subunit vaccines to be used in BCG-protein heterologous prime-boost vaccination scenarios. Additionally, the antigen most dominantly recognized in M. bovis-infected cattle in this study, Rv3616c, was significantly less frequently recognized by BCG vaccinees and could be a target to improve BCG. For example, this could be achieved by increasing its secretion in a recombinant BCG vaccine.

### Mva85a vaccine to enhance BCG for preventing tuberculosis [^113crxmy]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Low credibility.

Tuberculosis causes more deaths than any other infectious disease globally. Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) is the only available vaccine, but protection is incomplete and variable. The modified Vaccinia Ankara virus expressing antigen 85A (MVA85A) is a viral vector vaccine produced to prevent tuberculosis.

- **Objectives**: To assess and summarize the effects of the MVA85A vaccine boosting BCG in humans.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase (Ovid), and four other databases. We searched the WHO ICTRP and ClinicalTrials.gov. All searches were run up to 10 May 2018.

- **Selection criteria**: We evaluated randomized controlled trials of the MVA85A vaccine given with BCG in people regardless of age or HIV status.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility and risk of bias of trials and extracted and analyzed data. The primary outcome was active tuberculosis disease. We summarized dichotomous outcomes using risk ratios (RR) and risk differences (RD), with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Where appropriate, we combined data in meta-analyses. Where meta-analysis was inappropriate, we summarized results narratively.

- **Main results**: The search identified six studies related to four Phase 2 randomized controlled trials enrolling 3838 participants. Funding was by government bodies, charities, and philanthropic donors. Five studies included infants, one of them infants born to HIV-positive mothers.

### Bcg — different strains, different vaccines [^112Pvzkx]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

After nearly a century of use, BCG vaccines continue to generate controversy and confusion. Their ability to prevent tuberculosis in studies has been inconsistent. When they have been protective, no clear mechanism of action has been established. Furthermore, the existence of different BCG strains has been described since the 1940s. These strains vary according to several laboratory properties, which may or may not translate into a discernible effect on vaccination.

With recent genomic comparisons, it is now clear that different BCG vaccine strains have evolved and differ from each other and from the original BCG first used in 1921. Some of these genetic alterations explain certain variations in laboratory properties of BCG. However, these mutations in BCG strains have yet to be shown to affect BCG-associated protection and/or adverse effects. Continuing research is attempting to assess the effect of these genetic alterations on properties of BCG strains, with the goals of suggesting the ideal BCG for vaccination and providing avenues for improvement on existing BCG vaccines.

### Timing of exposure explains variation in BCG effectiveness: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117TuSwX]. Thorax (2021). Low credibility.

Tuberculosis (TB) is the world's leading infectious disease killer, and BCG is the only approved vaccine for its control. Global BCG coverage was 88% in 2019, which is close to the highest coverage of any vaccination. The substantial heterogeneity in the efficacy of BCG vaccination between studies has long been recognized, with study-level variables such as age, latitude, and BCG strain able to explain some of this variation in meta-analyses unrestricted by age.

Past attempts to understand this heterogeneity have often started from the assumption that protection wanes with time from vaccination. However, time since vaccination parallels immunological maturation and changing TB phenotype, which may lead to confounding. While retrospective national health data have shown that vaccine effectiveness can be sustained for over 15 years, multiple observational studies in low-burden settings have found that a past history of BCG vaccination significantly increases subsequent disease risk in TB contacts.

These observations suggest that the intensity or timing of M. tuberculosis (Mtb) exposure relative to age and time since vaccination may be important in determining vaccine effectiveness. However, no coherent theoretical framework has been proposed to explain the diversity of results and the adverse effects of BCG sometimes observed. Because of the markedly different disease phenotypes and onset timing relative to age of exposure, we reviewed evidence for the efficacy of BCG vaccination with a focus on TB-related epidemiology, diagnostic approach, time from vaccination, and age.

### Critical research concepts in tuberculosis vaccine development [^112n2q1H]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2014). Low credibility.

A new and improved vaccine against tuberculosis (TB) would provide a powerful tool to conquer one of the most insidious infectious diseases of mankind. Protection afforded by Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) has been shown to be limited and inconsistent, especially in adults who are known to transmit TB disease. In the last two decades, several new vaccines have been developed and tested with the aim of eliciting robust and long-lived T-cell responses against Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens.

Although much progress has been made in the TB vaccine field, there is an urgent need to address critical research questions about TB immunity, with a special focus on designing vaccines aimed at preventing infection and transmission of TB. Here, we discuss the rationale behind the immunization strategies being implemented for TB vaccines and provide some suggestions for hypothesis-driven research to encourage the development of novel TB vaccines.

### Mva85a vaccine to enhance BCG for preventing tuberculosis [^114FkQuB]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). High credibility.

Tuberculosis is an infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It was estimated that 10 million people developed tuberculosis in 2017. Tuberculosis now ranks first, followed by HIV, as the leading cause of death from an infectious disease worldwide, killing an estimated 1.6 million people in 2017, including 300,000 people living with HIV. Over 95% of these people were living in low- and middle-income countries [WHO 2018].

Tuberculosis can be classed as active when people experience signs or symptoms of tuberculosis or have radiological evidence of it. It can also be classified as latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI), where immunological evidence of previous exposure to M. tuberculosis exists without clinical or radiological evidence of the disease [CDC 2000]. For healthy adults with immunological evidence of previous exposure to M. tuberculosis, the overall lifetime risk of progressing to active disease if not treated is 5% to 10% [Harries 2006]. Often, this progression occurs months or years after the initial infection in response to a weakening of the body's immune system. The probability of developing active disease is higher in HIV-positive people, people with diabetes, and young children [Baker 2011; Perez-Velez 2012; Tiemersma 2011]. Fifty percent of infants with evidence of LTBI will progress to active disease if untreated [Marais 2004]. Therefore, people with LTBI require early diagnosis and treatment to reduce the pool of active tuberculosis cases. This is particularly important in high-risk groups.

### TB vaccine development: Where are we and why is it so difficult [^112LErtP]. Thorax (2015). Low credibility.

The development of an effective TB vaccine remains paramount to achieving the goal of global eradication of TB by 2050. The only licensed vaccine, BCG, has variable efficacy and is poorly effective in high-burden countries. The development of promising candidate vaccines to either 'boost' a BCG primed immune system or replace BCG altogether is a key area for innovative research. Here, we discuss some of the issues encountered in the development of potential candidate vaccines and the future challenges.

### Distinct gene expression signatures comparing latent tuberculosis infection with different routes of Bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccination [^113vnS9S]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Use of BCG as an intradermal (ID) vaccination administered to newborns protects young children from disseminated forms of TB, such as tuberculous meningitis. However, the ability of ID BCG to protect against pulmonary tuberculosis is inconsistent and, in many settings, quite limited. These findings suggest the possibility that ID BCG induces effective systemic immunity to Mtb but results in suboptimal localization of recall responses to the lung. In murine and guinea pig models, respiratory administration of BCG provides greater mucosal protection than subcutaneous or ID BCG. Bronchoscopic administration of BCG to the distal airways of rhesus macaques also resulted in improved protection from respiratory challenge with Mtb. However, respiratory vaccination using aerosolized BCG failed to provide greater protection from Mtb than ID vaccination, although intravenous (IV) BCG was uniquely able to provide sterilizing immunity in a majority of study animals. While widespread respiratory and IV administration of BCG to humans requires further development, mucosal vaccination via oral (PO) BCG administration has a long history of clinical safety and feasibility. Although its efficacy has not been formally studied, PO administration of BCG has been uniquely proven to induce Mtb-specific mucosal immunity in human participants.

In the study, we utilize RNA-Seq technology to assess gene expression signatures in an unbiased fashion from immune cells of peripheral blood and airways of control participants without prior BCG vaccination or Mtb infection, and LTBI individuals.

### Enhancing the protective efficacy of Mycobacterium bovis BCG vaccination against tuberculosis by boosting with the Mycobacterium tuberculosis major secretory protein [^111CE5G5]. Infection and Immunity (2005). Low credibility.

Tuberculosis continues to ravage humanity, killing 2 million people yearly. Most cases occur in areas where the disease is endemic, and almost everyone is vaccinated early in life with Mycobacterium bovis BCG, the currently available vaccine against tuberculosis. Therefore, while more potent vaccines are needed to replace BCG, new vaccines are also required to boost the immune protection of the 4 billion people already vaccinated with BCG. Until now, no booster vaccine has been shown capable of significantly enhancing the level of protective immunity induced by BCG in the stringent guinea pig model of pulmonary tuberculosis, the "gold standard" for testing tuberculosis vaccines.

In this paper, we describe a booster vaccine for BCG comprised of the purified recombinant Mycobacterium tuberculosis 30-kDa protein, the major secreted protein of this pathogen. In the guinea pig model of pulmonary tuberculosis, boosting BCG-immunized animals once with the 30-kDa protein greatly increased cell-mediated and humoral immune responses to the protein in three consecutive experiments. Most importantly, boosting BCG-immunized animals once with the 30-kDa protein significantly enhanced protective immunity against aerosol challenge with highly virulent M. tuberculosis. This enhancement was evidenced by a significantly reduced lung and spleen burden of M. tuberculosis compared with that for non-boosted BCG-immunized animals, with a mean additional reduction in colony-forming units (CFU) of 0.4 ± 0.1 log in the lung [P = 0.03] and 0.6 ± 0.1 log in the spleen [P = 0.002].

### Editorial commentary: Different strains of Bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccine have very different effects on tuberculosis and on unrelated infections [^116JBQhM]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

In addition to the important genetic differences between the strains of BCG, there are genetic differences within some strains that can cause major differences in the characteristics of the BCG vaccine produced from the same seed lot by different manufacturers and between different batches from a single manufacturer. BCG-Tokyo and BCG-Danish vaccines each contain at least two genotypes. In 1983, Osborn suggested that BCG vaccines used for routine immunization should be prepared from seed lots derived from single colonies so that they have stable characteristics. Unfortunately, this has not been done for BCG–Tokyo or BCG–Danish vaccines. This can lead to problems with the production of these vaccines and the potential for large variations in clinical effects.

BCG–Danish vaccine and probably BCG–Tokyo vaccine have potent nonspecific effects that substantially reduce mortality from diseases other than tuberculosis; however, these beneficial effects are not properly exploited at present. Although it is EPI policy for the BCG vaccine to be given to all infants at birth in high-prevalence regions, less than half actually receive the BCG vaccine in the first month of life, partly because health workers are told not to open a multidose vial until enough infants need the BCG vaccine. A 10- or 20-dose vial costs UNICEF only $0.75–$2.74, and BCG–Danish vaccine given soon after birth reduced neonatal mortality by 48% (95% CI, 18%–67%) in randomized trials in Guinea-Bissau. Policy should change so that as many infants as possible receive the BCG vaccine as soon as possible after birth, and a multidose vial.

### Effectiveness of BCG vaccination against Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection in adults: A cross-sectional analysis of a UK-based cohort [^113XPvsC]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2020). High credibility.

BCG appears to reduce the acquisition of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection in children, measured using interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs). We explored whether BCG vaccination continues to be associated with a decreased prevalence of M. tuberculosis infection in adults.

- **Methods**: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of data from adult contacts of tuberculosis cases participating in a UK cohort study. Vaccine effectiveness (VE) of BCG, ascertained based on the presence of a scar or vaccination history against latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI), measured via IGRA, was assessed using multivariable logistic regression. The effects of age at the time of BCG vaccination and time since vaccination were also explored.

- **Results**: Of 3,453 recent tuberculosis contacts, 27.5% had LTBI. There was strong evidence of an association between BCG and LTBI (adjusted odds ratio = 0.70; 95% confidence interval, .56-.87; p = 0.0017), yielding a VE of 30%. VE declined with time since vaccination, but there was evidence that LTBI prevalence was lower amongst vaccinated individuals even more than 20 years after vaccination compared with nonvaccinated participants.

- **Conclusions**: BCG is associated with a lower prevalence of LTBI in adult contacts of tuberculosis. These results contribute to the growing evidence that suggests BCG may protect against M. tuberculosis infection as well as disease. This has implications for immunization programs, vaccine development, and tuberculosis control efforts worldwide.

### Can earlier BCG-Japan and OPV vaccination reduce early infant mortality? A cluster-randomised trial in Guinea-Bissau [^117LmY9C]. BMJ Global Health (2024). High credibility.

In the Danish trial, stratified analyses suggested that maternal BCG vaccination status modified the effect of BCG vaccination. Among children of BCG-vaccinated mothers, BCG vaccination was associated with 35% (95% CI: 6% to 55%) fewer infectious disease hospital admissions. This was supported by a study from Guinea-Bissau, which also found stronger effects of BCG among infants when the mother had a BCG scar, an indicator of a successful BCG vaccination. Other studies have found maternal BCG scar to be beneficial on its own. In the present trial, BCG and OPV were beneficial for both children of mothers with and without a BCG scar.

The trial is, to our knowledge, the only trial assessing the effect of BCG and OPV vaccination versus no vaccination on early infant mortality in both low birthweight and normal birthweight newborns.

### Vaccines and dementia: Part I. Non-specific immune boosting with BCG: History, ligands, and receptors [^1122djnu]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2024). Low credibility.

We have reviewed evidence that multiple infectious agents can have broad-spectrum immunopotentiating effects, leading to the development of BCG in particular as a treatment for some cancers and as a prophylactic against diseases of the elderly such as pneumonia. In Part II of this work, we address emerging reports that BCG and other vaccines can protect against the development of dementias, including AD. Although we focus primarily on BCG, we emphasize that multiple different microbes and molecules can markedly boost immunity. Mycobacteria and BCG, in particular, appear to be special in this regard, and the reasons why will require detailed attention in the future.

### 100 years of Bacillus Calmette-Guérin immunotherapy: from cattle to COVID-19 [^1138vDqZ]. Nature Reviews Urology (2021). High credibility.

Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) is the most widely used vaccine worldwide and has been employed to prevent tuberculosis for a century. BCG also stimulates an anti-tumor immune response, which urologists have harnessed for the treatment of non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer. A growing body of evidence indicates that BCG offers protection against various non-mycobacterial and viral infections. The non-specific effects of BCG occur via the induction of trained immunity and form the basis for the hypothesis that BCG vaccination could be used to protect against the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This Perspective article highlights key milestones in the 100-year history of BCG and projects its potential role in the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Bacille Calmette Guérin (BCG) and new TB vaccines: Specific, cross-mycobacterial and off-target effects [^112AAmNT]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2020). Low credibility.

The Bacille Calmette Guérin (BCG) vaccine was developed over a century ago and has become one of the most used vaccines without undergoing a modern vaccine development life cycle. Despite this, the vaccine has protected many millions from severe and disseminated forms of tuberculosis (TB). In addition, BCG has cross-mycobacterial effects against non-tuberculous mycobacteria and off-target (also called non-specific or heterologous) effects against other infections and diseases. More recently, BCG's effects on innate immunity suggest it might improve the immune response against viral respiratory infections, including SARS-CoV-2. New TB vaccines developed over the last 30 years show promise, particularly in the prevention of progression to disease from TB infection in young adults. The role of BCG in the context of new TB vaccines remains uncertain as most participants included in trials have been previously BCG-immunized. BCG replacement vaccines are in efficacy trials, and these may also have off-target effects.

### Good old BCG - what a century-old vaccine can contribute to modern medicine [^11714Phb]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Early studies from Sweden and France by Naeslund and Albert Calmette himself demonstrated that childhood mortality was reduced after the introduction of BCG for reasons not related to tuberculosis. These findings have later been confirmed in studies from Africa by Stabell‐Benn and colleagues, who in this issue of JIM present a meta‐analysis on the correlation between BCG scarring and childhood survival. The study concludes that the presence of a BCG scar is correlated with reduced mortality in children in Guinea–Bissau and suggests that an early time‐point for BCG vaccination (during the first month of life) should be assured in national vaccination programmes. The importance of scar formation is also highlighted by the finding that the formation of a scar, which results from a short period of replication of the BCG at the injection site and the accompanying inflammatory infiltration, is much more strongly associated with the reduction in childhood mortality than just the administration of the vaccine. Finally, the consideration of revaccination of scar‐negative children is discussed as a means to enhance the coverage of effective BCG vaccination in vulnerable populations.

Another unexpected effect of BCG that has been in clinical practice for a very long time is its effect as a cancer therapeutic. It is widely used to treat bladder cancer (the vaccine is repeatedly instilled into the bladder) and has shown to be effective in reducing recurrence of noninvasive bladder cancer. Repeated injections of BCG have long been applied in veterinary science as well, to treat equi.

### On the relationship between BCG coverage and national COVID-19 outcome: Could 'heterologous' herd immunity explain why some countries are better off [^1127TAGg]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Navigating around confounders to explore a possible BCG-COVID-19 relationship

Given the documented ability of BCG to induce trained innate immunity, it would not be surprising if the vaccine also provides some level of protection against COVID-19. Numerous confounders may influence the validity of studies comparing the COVID-19 pandemic outcome in different populations and countries, including different management and testing strategies, reporting of confirmed cases, and COVID-19-related hospitalizations or death rates. Instead, a more reliable measure for early-phase pandemic outcomes could be the all-cause mortality relative to previous years, as, for example, the seasonal flu is reflected in the all-cause mortality during the winter months in many countries. Also, limiting analyses to regions with comparable national public health policies, societal organization, and life expectancy should be considered, and Europe provides a good example of that.

The recommendations of neonatal BCG vaccination vary greatly amongst the national vaccine plans (NVP) of European countries. While many countries, especially in Eastern Europe where tuberculosis is still relatively prevalent, have retained BCG in their NVPs (hereafter referred to as BCG-NVPs), a number of countries stopped the broad use of BCG in the 1980s as TB rates dropped. Some countries never had BCG in the NVPs, including Italy, Belgium, and the Netherlands.

To investigate a possible relationship between BCG-NVPs and excess mortality, I extracted data on the all-cause mortality of 17 European countries.

### Pulmonary but not subcutaneous delivery of BCG vaccine confers protection to tuberculosis-susceptible mice by an interleukin 17-dependent mechanism [^113Ztznz]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Some of the most promising novel tuberculosis vaccine strategies currently under development are based on respiratory vaccination, mimicking the natural route of infection. In this work, we have compared pulmonary and subcutaneous delivery of the BCG vaccine in the tuberculosis-susceptible DBA/2 mouse strain, a model in which parenterally administered BCG vaccine does not protect against tuberculosis. Our data show that intranasally but not subcutaneously administered BCG confers robust protection against pulmonary tuberculosis challenge. In addition, our results indicate that pulmonary vaccination triggers a Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific mucosal immune response orchestrated by interleukin 17A (IL-17A). Thus, IL-17A neutralization in vivo reduces protection and abrogates M. tuberculosis-specific immunoglobulin A (IgA) secretion to respiratory airways and lung expression of polymeric immunoglobulin receptor induced following intranasal vaccination. Together, our results demonstrate that pulmonary delivery of BCG can overcome the lack of protection observed when BCG is given parenterally, suggesting that respiratory tuberculosis vaccines could have an advantage in tuberculosis-endemic countries, where intradermally administered BCG has inefficient effectiveness against pulmonary tuberculosis.

### Mva85a vaccine to enhance BCG for preventing tuberculosis [^116dLV9x]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Low credibility.

The Bacillus Calmette‐Guérin (BCG) vaccine is currently the only available vaccine for tuberculosis. Epidemiological studies indicate that it has a protective effect against tuberculosis disease in children, particularly against the more severe forms such as tuberculosis meningitis or miliary tuberculosis. The effectiveness of BCG differs greatly depending on the site of infection. It consistently protects against tuberculous meningitis and miliary disease in children but offers variable protection against pulmonary tuberculosis. Despite many regions achieving high coverage of BCG vaccination, tuberculosis remains a significant problem, and developing a new vaccine remains a critical global research priority.

Previously, it was challenging to reliably determine whether the BCG vaccine protected against active disease or infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis due to the limitations of the tuberculin skin test in distinguishing between cases of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) and those vaccinated with BCG. The introduction of interferon γ release assays (IGRAs), which can differentiate between tuberculosis infection and vaccination, has proven useful. This advancement has enabled researchers to establish that BCG vaccination can reduce the risk of Mycobacterium infection in certain settings.

### Clinical and immune impact of Mycobacterium bovis BCG vaccination scarring [^113JdzwD]. Infection and Immunity (2002). Low credibility.

The World Health Organization recommends Mycobacterium bovis BCG vaccination in areas of high tuberculosis prevalence. However, the clinical and immune effects of BCG, which are not necessarily specific to Mycobacterium tuberculosis, remain unclear. BCG vaccine scarring is often used as a surrogate marker of vaccination or effective vaccination. We evaluated BCG scarring status in relation to clinical findings and outcomes in 700 hospitalized Malawians. Among these, 32 had M. tuberculosis bloodstream infections (BSI), with cellular immune studies conducted on 10 of them, and 48 were infants aged ≤ 6 months.

In individuals aged > 6 months, the presence of scarring was not related to pulmonary symptoms (35% versus 30%), chronic cough or fever, mortality, or M. tuberculosis BSI. In patients with M. tuberculosis BSI, scarring was unrelated to mortality, vital signs, or clinical symptoms; however, those with scarring had higher proportions of memory and activated T cells and exhibited more type 2-skewed cytokine profiles. Infants with either BCG scarring (n = 10) or BCG lesional inflammation (n = 5) exhibited no symptoms of sepsis, whereas 18 of 33 infants without BCG vaccination lesions did. Infants with BCG lesions had localized infections more often than those without BCG lesions. These infants also had lower median percentages of lymphocytes spontaneously making interleukin-4 (IL-4) or tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and lower ratios of T cells spontaneously making IL-4 to T cells making IL-6. Therefore, in older patients, BCG vaccine scarring was not associated with significant outcomes.

### Intravesical bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine affects cognition [^114ibTwx]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2024). High credibility.

Recently, several vaccines have been cited as lowering the risk of developing dementia. Our studies, along with others, have shown that intravesical bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) is significantly effective in treating non-invasive superficial bladder cancer and correlates with less dementia in treated patients. In our Israeli institutions, as well as in four other independent medical centers, there has been a reported reduction in dementia, specifically Alzheimer's disease (AD), ranging from 80% to 19% following BCG treatment. We have introduced the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) questionnaire to our bladder cancer patients as an early monitor of cognition to determine if BCG affects cognition. Early recognition of cognitive impairment is preferable to waiting for the diagnosis of full-fledged AD, as it may improve the success of intervention.

### TB vaccine development: Where are we and why is it so difficult [^112X1h2k]. Thorax (2015). Low credibility.

The development of an effective TB vaccine remains paramount to achieving the goal of global eradication of TB by 2050. The only licensed vaccine, BCG, has variable efficacy and is poorly effective in high-burden countries. The development of promising candidate vaccines to either "boost" a BCG-primed immune system or replace BCG altogether is a key area for innovative research. Here, we discuss some of the issues encountered in the development of potential candidate vaccines and the future challenges.

### Multi-omics analysis of innate and adaptive responses to BCG vaccination reveals epigenetic cell states that predict trained immunity [^113LC4ZM]. Immunity (2024). High credibility.

Immune responses are tightly regulated yet highly variable between individuals. To investigate human population variation of trained immunity, we immunized healthy individuals with Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG). This live-attenuated vaccine induces not only an adaptive immune response against tuberculosis but also triggers innate immune activation and memory that are indicative of trained immunity.

We established personal immune profiles and chromatin accessibility maps over a 90-day time course of BCG vaccination in 323 individuals. Our analysis uncovered genetic and epigenetic predictors of baseline immunity and immune response. BCG vaccination enhanced the innate immune response specifically in individuals with a dormant immune state at baseline, rather than providing a general boost of innate immunity.

This study advances our understanding of BCG's heterologous immune-stimulatory effects and trained immunity in humans. Furthermore, it highlights the value of epigenetic cell states for connecting immune function with genotype and the environment.

### Intravenous BCG vaccination of diversity outbred mice results in moderately enhanced protection against challenge with Mycobacterium tuberculosis compared to intradermal vaccination [^1173rxjD]. Infection and Immunity (2023). High credibility.

Tuberculosis remains the leading cause of death globally from any infectious disease, despite the widespread use of the live attenuated Bacille Calmette Guerin (BCG) vaccine. While BCG provides some efficacy against disseminated tuberculosis (TB) disease in children, its protection diminishes into adulthood, resulting in over 1.8 million TB deaths per year. This situation has triggered efforts to develop novel vaccine candidates that either replace or boost BCG and to test novel delivery mechanisms to enhance BCG's efficacy.

Traditional BCG vaccination is administered as an intradermal (ID) injection. However, delivering BCG through an alternate route may enhance the depth and breadth of protection. Previously, it was demonstrated that phenotypically and genotypically diverse outbred (DO) mice show heterogeneous responses to Mycobacterium tuberculosis challenge following intradermal BCG vaccination. Here, DO mice are utilized to examine BCG-induced protection when BCG is delivered systemically via intravenous (IV) administration.

The findings indicate that DO mice vaccinated with IV BCG had a greater distribution of BCG throughout their organs compared to ID-vaccinated animals. However, in comparison to ID-vaccinated mice, tuberculosis burdens in lungs and spleens were not significantly reduced in animals vaccinated with BCG IV, nor was lung inflammation significantly altered. Nonetheless, DO mice that received BCG IV showed increased survival over those vaccinated by the traditional ID route. These results suggest that delivering BCG via the alternate IV route enhances protection, as observed in this diverse small animal model.

### Novel tuberculosis vaccines on the horizon [^112H94Ve]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

Eleven new tuberculosis (TB) vaccines are in various phases of clinical trials. These include subunit vaccines intended to improve the BCG vaccine and recombinant BCG designed to substitute for BCG, both administered pre-exposure to prevent active disease. A plethora of potential candidates have reached various stages of the pre-clinical development pipeline, with some ready to enter Phase I clinical trials soon. A boost vaccine to enhance the immunity provided by the existing BCG is on the horizon and will be necessary until a better candidate to replace BCG is available. The live mutants of Mycobacterium tuberculosis show great promise but face myriad regulatory challenges.

### Bacillus Calmette-Guérin cases reported to the National Tuberculosis Surveillance System, United States, 2004–2015 [^114cWNGx]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) is used as a vaccine to protect against disseminated tuberculosis (TB) and as a treatment for bladder cancer. We describe characteristics of US TB patients reported to the National Tuberculosis Surveillance System (NTSS) whose disease was attributed to BCG. We identified 118 BCG cases and 91,065 TB cases reported to NTSS during 2004–2015. Most patients with BCG were US-born (86%), older (median age 75 years), and non-Hispanic white (81%). Only 17% of BCG cases had pulmonary involvement, in contrast with 84% of TB cases. Epidemiologic features of BCG cases differed from TB cases. Clinicians can use clinical history to discern probable BCG cases from TB cases, enabling optimal clinical management. Public health agencies can use this information to quickly identify probable BCG cases to avoid inappropriately reporting BCG cases to NTSS or expending resources on unnecessary public health interventions.

### What's old and new in tuberculosis vaccines for children [^115UQHK5]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2022). Low credibility.

Tuberculosis (TB) is a leading cause of global child mortality. Until the turn of the 21st century, Mycobacterium bovis bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) was the only vaccine to prevent TB. The pediatric TB vaccine pipeline has advanced in the past decade to include the evaluation of novel whole-cell vaccines to replace infant BCG and the investigation of subunit and whole-cell vaccines to boost TB immunity during adolescence. We describe the history of BCG, TB vaccine candidates in clinical trials, and the challenges and opportunities for future TB vaccine research in children. Children are a critical target population for TB vaccines, and the expansion of the pediatric TB vaccine pipeline is urgently needed to end the TB pandemic.

### Interpreting the results of trials of BCG vaccination for protection against COVID-19 [^111na5iZ]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2023). Low credibility.

BCG vaccination has beneficial off-target ("nonspecific") effects on nonmycobacterial infections. On this premise, trials were conducted to investigate whether BCG provides off-target protection against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). A literature search identified 11 randomized "BCG COVID-19" trials, with conflicting results. These trials and the differences in their study design are discussed using the PICOT (participants, intervention, control, outcome, and timing) framework to highlight the factors that likely explain their inconsistent findings. These factors include participant age, sex, comorbid conditions, BCG vaccination strain and dose, outcome measure, and duration of follow-up. Understanding how to control these factors to best exploit BCG's off-target effects will be important in designing future trials and intervention strategies.

### Mva85a vaccine to enhance BCG for preventing tuberculosis [^1119thj4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Low credibility.

We conducted an assessment of risk of bias in the included studies by utilizing the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool (Higgins 2011). Two review authors independently evaluated the studies for risk of bias. Any disagreements were resolved through discussion and, when necessary, consultation with a third review author.

- **Selection bias**: We assessed sequence generation, particularly looking for any predictable methods, and allocation concealment. Detection bias was evaluated through blinding methods, examining both the intention and success of blinding for each outcome. If there was no description of procedures, such as randomization methods, we marked it as unclear.

- **Outcome assessment**: The objectivity of outcome measures and the use of intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis were examined, along with the extent of loss to follow-up and selective outcome reporting. We verified whether outcome measures were specified a priori and matched the published endpoints with those in the study protocols.

- **Incomplete outcome data**: We assessed incomplete outcome data in each trial to determine the proportion of missing results and their impact on event risk and effect size. The assessment included understanding if reasons for missing data were related to adverse events or mortality from MVA85A, and whether missing data were balanced in the two experimental groups, to form an overall decision on risk associated with incomplete outcome data.

- **Additional dimensions**: Other dimensions assessed for risk of bias included conflicts of interest, significant differences in baseline characteristics, and early cessation of the trials.

### Need for BCG vaccination to prevent TB in high-incidence countries and populations [^115UgZTr]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

An estimated one-quarter of persons worldwide are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In 2018, the World Health Organization issued revised guidance on the BCG vaccine for high-risk groups. The World Health Organization should consider guiding countries on a case-by-case basis in developing appropriate BCG policies to deliver equitable healthcare and protect public health.

### Inflammation and immune activation are associated with risk of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection in BCG-vaccinated infants [^115NttU5]. Nature Communications (2022). Low credibility.

Tuberculosis (TB), caused by infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb), is a global health threat that, until the COVID-19 pandemic, killed more people annually than any other infectious pathogen. In 2020, there were 9.9 million new cases and 1.5 million deaths due to TB. In most M.tb infected individuals, infection is either eliminated or contained by the host immune response, resulting in a status of asymptomatic infection. Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG), the only licensed vaccine against TB, does not adequately protect against pulmonary disease, with especially low efficacy in TB endemic areas; hence, a new and improved vaccine is urgently needed.

Development of an effective and efficacious TB vaccine would be facilitated by an improved understanding of protective immunity. Although many aspects of host immunity are known to play a role in protection against TB, defined and validated correlates of protection are lacking. The identification of immune correlates of protection in human studies would allow for the rational design and development of TB vaccine candidates, and antigen delivery systems could be optimized to induce these immune correlates. Validation of immune correlates in field efficacy trials would ultimately enable the development and licensure of vaccines without the need for expensive, time-consuming field efficacy studies.

### Bacillus Calmette-Guérin treatment of bladder cancer: A systematic review and commentary on recent publications [^111hGaoT]. Current Opinion in Urology (2019). Low credibility.

- **Purpose of review**: Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) is the standard immunotherapy for nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer. A systematic review of published articles regarding BCG treatment of bladder cancer was conducted, and a commentary on these is provided to gain a perspective on the major developments in the field.

- **Recent findings**: Several BCG strains are utilized worldwide. As the understanding of genetic and phenotypic differences in these strains is elucidated, inquiries into the potential clinical effects of these various strains have been studied. Data suggest that some strains could be more effective than others, but further study is needed. Although the response to BCG is heterogeneous, clinical practice does not incorporate the use of biomarkers for treatment selection. Thus, biomarker prediction is an important area of research. Novel urine and tissue markers show promise in this endeavor. Notable publications also include mechanistic studies showing a role for T cells, natural killer cells, mast cells, and granulocytes in BCG's antitumor efficacy.

- **Summary**: Significant developments have occurred in understanding BCG's response and mechanism of action, which remains incompletely understood. Future work includes efforts to create recombinant BCG strains to decrease side effects, repeated instillations, and increase overall efficacy.

### Novel tuberculosis vaccination strategies based on understanding the immune response [^116e3ph9]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

The tuberculosis (TB) vaccine bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) fails to protect against adult pulmonary TB. Yet, its capacity to control miliary TB in newborn infants forms the basis for the development of novel vaccine candidates. These candidates either exploit genetic modification of BCG to create a viable replacement vaccine or use BCG to prime the immune response, followed by a boost with a novel subunit vaccine. This approach could ultimately result in a combination vaccination schedule comprising a prime with a live BCG replacement followed by a subunit vaccine boost. Ultimately, vaccination strategies that achieve sterile eradication of, or prevent infection with, tubercle bacilli would be an ambitious and highly promising goal.

### Live-attenuated Mycobacterium tuberculosis vaccine MTBVAC versus BCG in adults and neonates: a randomised controlled, double-blind dose-escalation trial [^1167xg5h]. The Lancet Respiratory Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Infants are a key target population for new tuberculosis vaccines. We assessed the safety and immunogenicity of the live-attenuated Mycobacterium tuberculosis vaccine candidate MTBVAC in adults and infants in a region where transmission of tuberculosis is very high.

- **Methods**: We conducted a randomised, double-blind, BCG-controlled, dose-escalation trial at the South African Tuberculosis Vaccine Initiative site near Cape Town, South Africa. Healthy adult community volunteers who were aged 18–50 years, had received BCG vaccination as infants, were HIV negative, had negative interferon-γ release assay (IGRA) results, and had no personal history of tuberculosis or household contact with someone with tuberculosis were enrolled in a safety cohort. Infants born to HIV-negative women with no personal history of tuberculosis or household contact with a person with tuberculosis and who were 96 hours old or younger, generally healthy, and had not yet received routine BCG vaccination were enrolled in a separate infant cohort. Eligible adults were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either BCG Vaccine SSI (5×10⁵ colony forming units [CFU] of Danish strain 1331 in 0.1 mL diluent) or MTBVAC (5×10⁵ CFU in 0.1 mL) intradermally in the deltoid region of the arm. After favourable review of 28-day reactogenicity and safety data in the adult cohort, infants were randomly assigned (1:3) to receive either BCG Vaccine SSI (2.5×10⁵ CFU in 0.05 mL diluent) or MTBVAC in three sequential cohorts of increasing MTBVAC dose (2.5×10³ CFU, 2.5×10⁴ CFU, and 2.5×10⁵ CFU in 0.05 mL).

### Good old BCG - what a century-old vaccine can contribute to modern medicine [^1123oKtj]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

In summary, the century-old vaccine BCG remains one of the world's most widely used vaccines, despite being suboptimal for preventing pulmonary tuberculosis in adults. Novel tuberculosis vaccines are in development, some of which are based on the original BCG or novel versions of BCG-like vaccines. A major challenge for these vaccine candidates is to demonstrate superior protection compared to BCG in human populations. It will certainly take time before it can be universally replaced by novel approaches to prevent TB. Additionally, the increasingly well-appreciated beneficial nonspecific effects of BCG make it a very valuable tool for public health in general. Therefore, there is no doubt that BCG will continue its journey throughout the 21st century and gradually reveal more of its hidden secrets.

### Good old BCG - what a century-old vaccine can contribute to modern medicine [^115HJ2Wk]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) is derived from Mycobacterium bovis, the causative agent of bovine tuberculosis. The bacterium was cultivated between 1908 and 1921, and as demonstrated almost a century later [1], during these years of in vitro growth on solid culture media, it lost large regions of chromosomal DNA, some of which encoded important virulence determinants. This loss of virulence made it harmless enough to allow administration of the vaccine to newborns, and it has become the world's most widely used vaccine. Today, it is recommended by the WHO for the protection of young children against the most severe and deadly forms of tuberculosis [2].

The never-fading interest in BCG is reflected in PubMed-listed citations emerging from the simple search 'BCG', revealing an accelerating 'doubling-rate' from 220 in 1950 to 400 around the millennial turn to 800 articles in 2020. A brief dip in the number of publications can be noted in the late 50s, probably as a result of the discovery of antibiotics and the premature conclusion that TB was history at that time.

### Editorial commentary: Different strains of Bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccine have very different effects on tuberculosis and on unrelated infections [^111tNYCd]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

The Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) recommends that the BCG vaccine be given at birth to all neonates in countries with a high prevalence of tuberculosis. The World Health Organization-approved vaccines are BCG–Danish, BCG–Tokyo, and BCG–Moscow. Are different strains of BCG equivalent? A large randomized trial in 303,092 neonates in Hong Kong found that the risk of tuberculosis with the BCG–Pasteur vaccine was 45% (95% CI, 22%–61%) less than with BCG–Glaxo. In a cohort study in Kazakhstan, vaccination of neonates reduced the risk of clinically diagnosed tuberculosis by 69% (95% CI, 61%–75%) after BCG–Tokyo vaccination, by 43% (95% CI, 31%–53%) after BCG–Serbia, and only by 22% (95% CI, 7%–35%) after BCG–Moscow. These findings suggest that there are very large differences in effectiveness against tuberculosis between BCG strains.

In 2014, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) supplied 86 million doses of BCG–Moscow vaccine (the least effective strain in Kazakhstan), only 31 million doses of BCG–Tokyo (the most effective strain in Kazakhstan), and only 5 million doses of BCG–Danish (the strain that reduced neonatal mortality by 48% in Guinea-Bissau). However, UNICEF's purchasing was constrained by limited supplies of BCG–Tokyo and BCG–Danish vaccines.

The nonspecific effects of the BCG vaccine are greater when there is a scar following BCG–Danish or BCG–Moscow vaccination. Different strains of BCG have very different scar rates, usually greater than 90% for BCG–Danish and BCG–Tokyo vaccines, but only 52% for BCG–Moscow vaccine in Guinea-Bissau and Uganda. Consequently, different strains…

### Vaccines and dementia: Part I. Non-specific immune boosting with BCG: History, ligands, and receptors [^113HyWjp]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2024). Low credibility.

Mycobacterium tuberculosis is classified as being Gram-positive, but DNA sequencing reveals that it is more closely related to Gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa than it is to other Gram-positive bacteria. Although mycobacteria are often regarded as being intracellular pathogens, there is direct evidence for persistence as free forms in the extracellular milieu. Principally affecting the lung, TB can also affect other tissues, including bone and the nervous system. TB can be treated with antibiotics but can be life-threatening if untreated. Infections are commonplace in cattle and other animals, including nonhuman primates, and mankind has probably been exposed to TB for eons. This could explain why over 90% of people infected are asymptomatic, suggesting that robust immune defenses have emerged through Darwinian selection. Nevertheless, perhaps a quarter of the world population presently harbors latent TB, and the disease remains the second leading cause of death worldwide from infectious disease after COVID-19.

On July 1, 1921, a physician from the children's department of the Charité Hospital in Paris consulted Calmette and Guerin about a child whose mother had died of TB shortly after birth. Not only was the mother tuberculous, but also the grandmother who was caring for the infant. At that time, an infant born under these conditions would have a 7–25% chance of dying before reaching the age of 1 year, whereas this was under 2% in a normal family. Calmette, then in Paris, agreed to treat the child with BCG.

### Human newborn bacille Calmette-Guérin vaccination and risk of tuberculosis disease: a case-control study [^11769SyS]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Newborn vaccination with bacille Calmette–Guérin (BCG) protects infants and young children against disseminated forms of tuberculosis (TB) and, to some extent, against pulmonary TB. Since BCG's protective efficacy in other age groups is variable and mostly poor, new vaccines against TB are needed. An incomplete understanding of the immunological mechanisms underlying protection against TB hampers vaccine discovery and development. Our aim was to define host correlates of prospective risk of TB disease following BCG vaccination. We proposed that this knowledge would lead to greater insight into protective mechanisms against the disease, which, in turn, would inform vaccine development.

We applied a systems biology approach to analyze unique prospective samples and showed that in healthy infants who displayed different patterns of immune responses to the BCG vaccine, distinct mechanisms may underlie susceptibility to future TB disease, suggesting that the same intervention may not benefit all.

### Mva85a vaccine to enhance BCG for preventing tuberculosis [^113RhrXf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). High credibility.

- **Unit of analysis issues**: For included studies that had multiple intervention arms, data from these studies were included by splitting the control group so that participants were only included in the meta-analysis once.

- **Dealing with missing data**: In our protocol, we anticipated that if the amount of incomplete outcome data was such that the trials were thought to be at a high risk of bias, we might use imputation and perform sensitivity analyses to investigate the impact of these missing data. However, we identified no studies where missing data affected our ability to measure outcomes. Therefore, we used available-case analysis, as planned in our protocol.

- **Assessment of heterogeneity**: We assessed extracted data from included trials to find key differences in population groups, study settings, intervention and control groups, dosages and routes of vaccine administration, or timing between BCG and boosting. We assessed the degree of risk of bias, when and how the outcome was measured, and variation in treatment effects.

	- We determined the level of heterogeneity by inspecting forest plots for overlapping CIs. We judged a Chi-square P value significance level of 0.1 or less as likely heterogeneity. An I-square statistic value of less than 40% was regarded as not showing any significant heterogeneity.

- **Assessment of reporting biases**: There was an insufficient number of trials included, so we were unable to assess for publication bias using funnel plots or Egger regression.

- **Data synthesis**: We used the fixed-effect Mantel-Haenszel model for meta-analysis where there was little heterogeneity.

### Gene expression and cytokine profile correlate with mycobacterial growth in a human BCG challenge model [^111A9kvg]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine is the most widely administered vaccine in the world, yet its mechanism of action remains unclear. We hypothesize that certain immune pathways are associated with reduced mycobacterial growth following BCG challenge in human volunteers.

- **Methods**: We used samples from a mycobacterial challenge in which previously BCG-vaccinated or BCG-naive adults in the United Kingdom were challenged intradermally with a standard dose of BCG. Any remaining BCG was quantified in a skin biopsy specimen obtained 2 weeks after the challenge and used as a measure of BCG growth and functional antimycobacterial immunity. We measured the immune response over the 2-week challenge using DNA microarrays and flow cytometry, and correlated this with mycobacterial growth.

- **Results**: The magnitude of the immune response to BCG is greater in previously vaccinated volunteers, and this correlates with reduced mycobacterial growth but increased scarring at the vaccination site. In particular, the interferon γ and interleukin 17 pathways are strongly induced in previously vaccinated volunteers and correlate with reduced mycobacterial growth in this population.

- **Conclusion**: This study identifies pathways associated with control of mycobacterial growth in vivo in human volunteers and supports the use of BCG challenge as a tool for evaluating vaccine efficacy and identifying mechanisms of antimycobacterial immunity.

### Infant BCG vaccination and risk of pulmonary and extrapulmonary tuberculosis throughout the life course: a systematic review and individual participant data meta-analysis [^1123Eez7]. The Lancet Global Health (2022). High credibility.

BCG vaccines are administered to more than 100 million children annually, yet there is significant debate regarding the vaccine's effectiveness in preventing tuberculosis and death, especially among older children and adults. This study aimed to investigate the age-specific impact of infant BCG vaccination on the development and mortality of both pulmonary and extrapulmonary tuberculosis.

- **Methods**: In this systematic review and individual participant data meta-analysis, we searched databases such as MEDLINE, Web of Science, BIOSIS, and Embase without language restrictions. We focused on case-contact cohort studies of tuberculosis contacts published between Jan 1, 1998, and April 7, 2018. Search terms included "mycobacterium tuberculosis", "TB", "tuberculosis", and "contact". Cohort studies that lacked information on BCG vaccination or were conducted in countries not recommending BCG vaccination at birth were excluded. Individual-level participant data for a prespecified list of variables, including characteristics of the exposed participant (contact), the index case, and the environment, were requested from authors of all eligible studies.

Our primary outcome was a composite of prevalent (diagnosed at or within 90 days of baseline) and incident (diagnosed more than 90 days after baseline) tuberculosis in contacts exposed to tuberculosis. Secondary outcomes were focused on pulmonary tuberculosis, extrapulmonary tuberculosis, and mortality. We derived adjusted odds ratios (aORs) using mixed-effects, binary, multivariable logistic regression analyses with study-level random effects. Adjustments were made accordingly.

### Does the BCG vaccine have different effects on strains of tuberculosis [^111j9rQt]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2021). Low credibility.

Several explanations have been suggested concerning the variety in bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine efficacy on strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). This study aimed to compare the effect of BCG vaccination history in the prevention of the occurrence of Mtb-Beijing and non-Beijing strains. In this cross-sectional study, 64 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) were recruited from the Iranian border provinces (Northwest and West). Isolates were subjected to restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis, using the insertion sequence IS6110 as a probe (IS6110 RFLP) and drug susceptibility testing using the proportion method. Samples were analyzed with Gel Compare II 6.6 and SPSS version 18.

The mean age [standard deviation (SD)] of the patients was 54.4 (SD = 17.0). Overall, 49 cases (76.56%) had no BCG vaccination scar. The prevalence of Beijing strains was 9.38%, and the drug resistance proportion among the isolates was 14.1% (nine cases). There was a significant relationship between Beijing strains and TB-drug resistance in isolates (χ² = 26.29, P < 0.001). There was also a strong association between vaccination history and Beijing strains (χ² = 13.23, P = 0.002). Additionally, a statistical relationship was observed between Beijing strains and drug-resistant TB among patients with a history of vaccination (χ² = 7.47, P = 0.002). This association was not maintained in the unvaccinated group (P = 0.102).

These findings confirm the claim that the vaccine has different effects on different subspecies of tuberculosis.

### Influence of bacille Calmette-Guérin vaccination on size of tuberculin skin test reaction: To what size [^113MSMsf]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Previous bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination can confound the results of a tuberculin skin test (TST). We sought to determine a cutoff diameter of TST induration beyond which the influence of BCG vaccination was negligible in evaluating potential Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection in a population of health care workers with a high vaccination rate and low incidence of tuberculosis.

- **Methods**: From 1991 through 1998, all new employees at the University Hospital of Lausanne, Switzerland, underwent a 2-step TST at entry visit. We also gathered information on demographic characteristics, along with factors commonly associated with tuberculin positivity, including previous BCG vaccination, history of latent M. tuberculosis infection, and predictors for M. tuberculosis infection.

- **Results**: Among the 5117 investigated subjects, we found that the influence of BCG vaccination on TST results varied across categories of age (likelihood ratio test, 0.0001). Prior BCG vaccination had a strong influence on skin test results of ≤ 18 mm in diameter among persons < 40 years old, compared with the influence of factors predictive of M. tuberculosis infection. Prior latent M. tuberculosis infection and travel or employment in a country in which tuberculosis is endemic also had significant influences.

- **Conclusions**: Interpretation of TST reactions of ≤ 18 mm among BCG-vaccinated persons < 40 years of age must be done with caution in areas with a low incidence of tuberculosis. In such a population, except for persons who have never been vaccinated, TST reactions of ≤ 18 mm are…

### Editorial commentary: Different strains of Bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccine have very different effects on tuberculosis and on unrelated infections [^115kCyd5]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

The Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccine provides good protection against disseminated mycobacterial diseases such as miliary tuberculosis, tuberculous meningitis, and leprosy, but offers weaker protection against pulmonary tuberculosis, especially in rural areas near the equator. In high-mortality countries, until a different vaccine is introduced, the BCG vaccine also provides nonspecific (heterologous) protection against diseases other than tuberculosis and leprosy, mainly respiratory infections and sepsis. In randomized trials conducted in Guinea-Bissau, vaccination with the BCG–Danish vaccine reduced neonatal mortality in low-birth-weight babies by 48% (95% confidence interval, 18%–67%), and revaccination reduced all-cause mortality by 64% (95% CI, 1%–87%) in children aged 19 months who had received a booster dose of the diphtheria–tetanus–pertussis vaccine. The BCG vaccine may also have important nonspecific effects in high-income countries. In a cohort study in Spain, the BCG–Danish vaccine reduced nontuberculous hospital admissions in infants by 32% (95% CI, 31%–34%) for respiratory infections and by 53% (95% CI, 44%–61%) for sepsis.

In this issue of Clinical Infectious Diseases, Storgaard and colleagues report the results of a study based on a remarkable surveillance system that has prospectively monitored a representative sample of rural Guinea-Bissau since 1990. This database is extraordinary. The study found a scar in only 52% of children given the BCG–Moscow vaccine, mirroring the same rate as in Uganda, but much lower than the 72%–97% scar rate observed after administration of the BCG–Danish vaccine in urban Gu.

### Can we treat bladder cancer with intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin in patients with prior tuberculosis infection? A population-based cohort study [^113EHoCJ]. BMC Urology (2020). Low credibility.

A history of prior TB infection should not be a contraindication for adjuvant intravesical BCG immunotherapy, because it does not affect the treatment efficacy or safety in patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. A prospective study including more patients is warranted to verify this finding.

### Interpreting the results of trials of BCG vaccination for protection against COVID-19 [^1154Eq1b]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2023). Low credibility.

Complete blinding is an inevitable challenge in all BCG trials due to predictable injection site reactions and scarring. The presumption of randomization group by participants or trial staff based on the presence or absence of a scar might bias outcome assessment by influencing symptom reporting or testing for COVID-19. It might also influence exposure to SARS-CoV-2 by changing other behaviors, such as adherence to mask-wearing and other personal protective measures. Ten trials were double-blinded and used saline placebo vaccinations (as noted in supplementary materials). One trial was not blinded to participants and delivered no intervention to the control group.

### Mva85a vaccine to enhance BCG for preventing tuberculosis [^112yNsKF]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). High credibility.

We conducted a subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity. Our aim was to explore heterogeneity by considering subgroups such as children and adults, background prevalence of tuberculosis (or tuberculosis incidence in the control group), HIV status, and geographical location. Unfortunately, there were not enough trials to explore these subgroups when we encountered high heterogeneity. If subgroup analysis did not explain the heterogeneity, we considered a random-effects meta-analysis. We applied the I² statistic according to the following guidance: less than 40% as not significant heterogeneity; 30% to 60% as representing moderate heterogeneity; 50% to 90% as substantial heterogeneity; and 75% to 100% as considerable heterogeneity. A Chi² P value significance level of 0.1 or less and an I² statistic greater than 40% indicated significant heterogeneity, leading us to either consider a random-effects model or forgo the meta-analysis.

We did not perform sensitivity analysis for imputed data, risk of bias, or any other peculiarities identified between the trials during the review process. The certainty of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach. We constructed a 'Summary of Findings' table, which outlines the key findings of the review alongside the certainty of the evidence.

### Need for BCG vaccination to prevent TB in high-incidence countries and populations [^111DartU]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

An estimated one quarter of persons worldwide are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In 2018, the World Health Organization issued revised guidance on BCG vaccine for high-risk groups. The World Health Organization should consider guiding countries on a case-by-case basis in developing appropriate BCG policies to deliver equitable healthcare and protect public health.

### Bladder cancer, a unique model to understand cancer immunity and develop immunotherapy approaches [^112QUHcY]. The Journal of Pathology (2019). Low credibility.

Following FDA approval, many additional clinical trials have been conducted to investigate the long-term clinical benefits of BCG intravesical instillation. A significant difference in time to first recurrence between BCG and chemotherapy was confirmed after follow-up periods of greater than 8 years. However, there were no significant differences in disease progression and long-term endpoints, although marginal differences for distant metastases (p = 0.046), overall survival (OS; p = 0.023), and disease-specific survival (p = 0.026) comparing BCG and epirubicin chemotherapy were reported in a randomized phase III clinical trial with 837 patients. These studies also helped to optimize the dosage and schemes of BCG instillations.

### Interpreting the results of trials of BCG vaccination for protection against COVID-19 [^116C61ew]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

BCG vaccination has beneficial off-target ("nonspecific") effects on nonmycobacterial infections. Based on this premise, trials have been conducted to investigate whether BCG provides off-target protection against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). A literature search identified 11 randomized "BCG COVID-19" trials, which presented conflicting results. These trials and their differing study designs are discussed using the PICOT (participants, intervention, control, outcome, and timing) framework to highlight factors likely explaining the inconsistent findings. These factors include participant age, sex, comorbid conditions, BCG vaccination strain, dose, outcome measure, and duration of follow-up. Understanding how to control these factors to best exploit BCG's off-target effects will be important in designing future trials and intervention strategies.

### Good old BCG - what a century-old vaccine can contribute to modern medicine [^115PRpXM]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

In December 2018, a conference was held at the Institut Pasteur de Lille in Lille, France, the birthplace of BCG. This was the second international workshop dedicated exclusively to BCG and was organized to celebrate the 110th anniversary of the first subculture of M. bovis, which finally led to the BCG.

The conference gathered speakers from 17 different countries in Europe, the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Australia. All continents were represented, and the presentations covered a wide range of subjects, including the history of BCG, the place of BCG in the fight against mycobacterial diseases, genomics of BCG, next-generation BCGs, off-target effects of BCG, and the effects of BCG in cancer, autoimmune, and inflammatory diseases.

This initially unexpected width of beneficial effects that BCG has unveiled over the years has led to major new discoveries and resulted in treatments against a wide variety of human diseases beyond tuberculosis and leprosy, ranging from cancer to diabetes. The full potential of BCG is only recently being systematically explored, including the possibility that BCG may have a protective effect on coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) [3], which was not heard of at the time of the conference. The underlying mechanisms of this variety of effects are currently an area of intense investigation throughout the world and have greatly contributed to the concept of 'trained immunity' [4].

The Lille BCG conference inspired us to prepare a special issue for the Journal of Internal Medicine by asking some of the speakers at the conference for contributions.

### Need for BCG vaccination to prevent TB in high-incidence countries and populations [^114e5TSp]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

In 1993, the World Health Organization (WHO) recognized tuberculosis (TB) as a global emergency. Twenty-five years later, TB remains a major public health challenge as it is the single leading infectious cause of death globally. An estimated one-quarter of the world's population is infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In 2017, 10 million persons became ill with TB, and 1.6 million died from it. That year, an estimated 1 million children became ill with TB, and 230,000 died.

Ending the TB epidemic by 2030 is a primary goal of WHO and, if achieved, will contribute to WHO's Sustainable Development Goal 3, which is concerned with health. In keeping with Pillar 1 of the End TB Strategy, no opportunity to control TB should be missed. The treatment for latent infection, in combination with treatment measures for active disease or with pre-exposure vaccination, can substantially decrease TB incidence.

Until a new TB vaccine is developed, M. bovis bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) remains the only effective vaccine for TB. BCG's overall efficacy, including cost-effectiveness, has been questioned by studies that were confounded by the cross-reactivity of antigens and the absence of measures to exclude latent infection before vaccination. None of these studies considered BCG's primary preventive effect on drug-resistant TB and tangential benefits, such as avoidance of prolonged treatment and unwanted adverse effects. BCG's importance is again increasing in light of new, encouraging evidence about its efficacy and because of the limited availability of alternative new anti-TB strategies.

### Fact and fiction in tuberculosis vaccine research: 10 years later [^1154tfgs]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Tuberculosis is one of the most deadly infectious diseases. The situation is worsening because of co-infection with HIV and increased occurrence of drug resistance. Although the BCG vaccine has been in use for 90 years, protection is insufficient; new vaccine candidates are therefore needed. Twelve potential vaccines have gone into clinical trials. Ten are aimed at the prevention of tuberculosis, and of these, seven are subunit vaccines presented as either adjuvanted or viral-vectored antigens. These vaccines would serve as boosters for BCG-prime vaccination.

Three vaccines are recombinant BCG constructs, representing possible replacements for BCG. Additional vaccine candidates will enter clinical trials in the near future, including postexposure vaccines for individuals with latent infection. In the long term, vaccines that prevent or eradicate infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis would be the best possible option.

Improved knowledge of immunology, molecular microbiology, cell biology, biomics, and biotechnology has paved the way toward an effective and safe vaccine against tuberculosis. The pipeline of new vaccine candidates, from preclinical to clinical testing, could be accelerated by the development of biomarkers that can predict the clinical outcome of tuberculosis.

### Unraveling the mechanism of the antitumor activity of Bacillus Calmette-Guérin [^115zNw38]. European Urology (2021). Low credibility.

Our understanding of the mechanism of Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) in controlling urothelial carcinoma is still evolving. Studies have revealed a complex and multifaceted immune response. BCG-elicited adaptive antitumor immunity directed towards tumor antigens could have major implications for trial design.
