## Question

What is the recommended antiviral treatment for immunocompromised patients with resistant cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended antiviral treatment options for immunocompromised patients with resistant cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define and confirm resistant versus refractory CMV. Then, I should verify when and how to obtain genotypic resistance testing and how to interpret results. Next, I will consider host-directed strategies, including immunosuppression modulation. After that, I need to select antiviral therapy based on genotype and clinical context, including when to use maribavir, foscarnet, cidofovir, or high-dose ganciclovir. I will then examine combination therapy, duration, and monitoring. Finally, I should address special populations, prevention of resistance, and summarize a practical algorithm with key cautions and stewardship principles.

> Let me first confirm the definitions, because management hinges on distinguishing true resistance from refractory infection. Refractory CMV infection is defined as an increase by more than 1 log10 in CMV DNA after at least 2 weeks of appropriately dosed therapy, or persistent DNAemia with minimal change, using the same assay and laboratory for consistency, whereas resistant CMV requires detection of mutations known to confer decreased susceptibility to specific antivirals; importantly, early paradoxical increases in viral load can occur in the first week and should not trigger premature changes before the 2-week mark [^112jw2KX] [^114b9Rh8] [^115eNHfw].

> Wait, let me verify the timing and triggers for resistance testing, because acting too early can misclassify virologic kinetics as failure. Resistance testing is indicated when CMV DNA fails to decline by more than 1 log10 after more than 2 weeks of appropriately dosed therapy, or when there is persistent or rising viremia despite therapy; testing is most reliable when the viral load is at least 1,000 IU/mL, and results at lower levels may be less reproducible, so I should ensure adequate viral burden before sending sequencing [^114b9Rh8] [^112jHpty].

> I need to check which genes to sequence and why. Genotypic testing should assess UL97, UL54, and UL56 or UL89 because UL97 mutations confer ganciclovir resistance, UL54 mutations confer multidrug resistance including to foscarnet and cidofovir, and UL56/UL89/UL51 mutations confer letermovir resistance; importantly, UL97 and UL54 mutations can co-occur, producing high-level ganciclovir resistance with potential cross-resistance to cidofovir, which materially alters agent selection [^111TfXSx] [^114b2BQT].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about antivirals before optimizing host factors. I should confirm whether immunosuppression can be reduced safely, because decreasing immunosuppression is a cornerstone of management and can improve viral control. In solid organ transplant recipients, transitioning to an mTOR inhibitor may help, and in all settings, balancing rejection risk against CMV control requires multidisciplinary input and careful monitoring [^11351wqQ] [^114b2BQT].

> Next, I should review first-line therapy for confirmed resistant or refractory CMV. Maribavir 400 mg orally twice daily is now the preferred agent for R/R CMV in adults and adolescents meeting weight and age criteria, with phase 3 data showing superior clearance of viremia versus investigator-assigned therapy and a more favorable renal and hematologic safety profile; however, I must remember that maribavir has poor CNS penetration and should not be used for CMV retinitis or encephalitis, and it is antagonistic with ganciclovir, so coadministration is contraindicated [^114T4Thw] [^113nGsWq] [^114tgXG6].

> Let me consider genotype-guided alternatives when maribavir is unsuitable or unavailable. If high-level UL97-mediated ganciclovir resistance is present, foscarnet is a reasonable alternative; if UL54 mutations confer resistance to ganciclovir and foscarnet, cidofovir may be considered, acknowledging nephrotoxicity and the need for hydration and probenecid; for low-level UL97 mutations, high-dose ganciclovir 7.5–10 mg/kg every 12 hours may be attempted if end-organ disease is not suspected, but I should monitor closely for failure and switch promptly if there is no response [^113KS3Ud] [^112v47rp] [^114b2BQT].

> But wait, what if the patient has tissue-invasive disease or cannot take oral therapy. In severe or life-threatening disease, or when absorption is uncertain, I should favor intravenous therapy with ganciclovir or foscarnet, reserving cidofovir for selected cases given toxicity; for CMV pneumonia, I should obtain BAL PCR to support diagnosis and consider adjunctive IVIG in severe thoracic disease, while recognizing that BAL thresholds are not definitive and clinical correlation is essential [^116iiC9r] [^113RmHvE] [^1174JsYg].

> I should double-check the role of combination therapy, because I initially thought ganciclovir plus foscarnet might be broadly synergistic. However, in vitro synergy is inconsistent and clinical superiority over monotherapy is unproven except in select contexts like sight-threatening retinitis, so routine combination therapy is not recommended. A short course of foscarnet plus maribavir followed by maribavir monotherapy may be considered in complicated R/R cases to accelerate viral decay, but this remains investigational and should be individualized [^1128JcAQ] [^1111XKWz] [^114T4Thw].

> Next, I should review treatment duration and monitoring. Treatment should continue for at least 2–4 weeks and until two consecutive undetectable CMV DNA results are obtained, with longer courses for tissue-invasive disease. Weekly viral load monitoring is necessary, and if there is breakthrough viremia or clinical deterioration, I should repeat genotypic testing to detect emergent resistance and adjust therapy accordingly [^113donMN].

> Let me think about special populations, because pediatric and HIV patients require tailored approaches. In children, maribavir is approved for those aged 12 years and older and weighing at least 35 kg at adult dosing. For younger children, management follows adult principles but dosing data are limited and expert consultation is advised. In HIV, resistance patterns and principles are similar, with foscarnet favored for ganciclovir-resistant disease and combination therapy reserved for select scenarios like sight-threatening retinitis or neurologic disease [^1136jZvK] [^111SxQKn] [^112No35t].

> I need to ensure prevention strategies are addressed to reduce the risk of resistance. Prolonged ganciclovir exposure, high-risk transplant phenotypes, and suboptimal dosing increase resistance risk; letermovir prophylaxis in HCT reduces clinically significant CMV and may indirectly reduce R/R CMV, but it should not be used for treatment due to a low barrier to resistance; stewardship programs can optimize dosing, minimize unnecessary switching, and standardize resistance testing workflows to mitigate resistance emergence [^113G7vyu] [^116fZCQY] [^114rSBtu] [^11351wqQ].

> Hold on, I should verify a few practical pitfalls. Letermovir resistance mutations in UL56/UL89/UL51 do not confer cross-resistance to ganciclovir or foscarnet, so switching to those agents is appropriate; maribavir and ganciclovir are mechanistically antagonistic and should not be combined; and although therapeutic drug monitoring for ganciclovir exists, routine TDM is not recommended because troughs and peaks do not reliably predict efficacy or toxicity in clinical practice [^114b2BQT] [^114T4Thw] [^115Er4Gc].

> Let me reconsider the overall algorithm to ensure internal consistency. First, confirm refractory or resistant CMV using standardized definitions and ensure adequate antiviral exposure before declaring failure. Second, obtain genotypic resistance testing on a specimen with at least 1,000 IU/mL and adjust therapy while awaiting results if the patient is clinically deteriorating. Third, implement host-directed strategies to reduce immunosuppression when safe. Fourth, select antiviral therapy based on genotype and clinical context, prioritizing maribavir for R/R CMV when appropriate and using foscarnet or cidofovir when genotype or organ involvement dictates. Fifth, monitor weekly until two undetectable results are achieved and extend therapy for tissue-invasive disease. Finally, incorporate prevention and stewardship measures to limit future resistance and involve infectious diseases specialists early for complex cases [^112jw2KX] [^112jHpty] [^113donMN] [^112WNd9a].

---

For immunocompromised patients with resistant CMV, **maribavir 400 mg orally twice daily** is the first-line therapy [^113nGsWq] [^114T4Thw], with **foscarnet or cidofovir as alternatives** if maribavir is unavailable or contraindicated [^114b2BQT]. Genotypic resistance testing should guide therapy [^114b9Rh8] [^112e4GoM], and **immunosuppression reduction** should be pursued when feasible [^11351wqQ]. Treatment duration is at least 2–4 weeks after viral clearance, with close monitoring for adverse effects and resistance emergence [^112WNd9a] [^113UCKw1] [^112e4GoM].

## Definitions and clinical significance of resistant CMV

Resistant CMV is defined by the presence of **genetic mutations** that reduce susceptibility to antiviral agents [^115eNHfw], whereas refractory CMV refers to persistent or increasing viral load despite appropriate therapy [^112jw2KX]. Both scenarios are associated with increased morbidity and mortality, particularly in transplant recipients and patients with advanced HIV [^116aG9wA] [^111T8vjb].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

### Genotypic resistance testing

- **Indications**: Perform genotypic resistance testing when CMV viremia fails to decline by > 1 log10 after > 2 weeks of appropriately dosed antiviral therapy [^112e4GoM] or when viral load increases despite therapy [^112e4GoM].

- **Genes tested**: UL97 (confers ganciclovir resistance), UL54 (confers multidrug resistance), UL56, UL89, UL51 (confer letermovir resistance) [^114b2BQT].

- **Clinical utility**: Results guide selection of effective antiviral therapy and help avoid agents with cross-resistance [^114b2BQT].

---

### Phenotypic resistance testing

Phenotypic testing is less commonly available and slower than genotypic methods but can provide direct **susceptibility data**; it is generally reserved for complex cases or research settings [^112m9VXL].

## Recommended antiviral therapies for resistant CMV

| **Antiviral agent** | **Mechanism of action** | **Recommended use** | **Key considerations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Maribavir | UL97 kinase inhibitor | First-line therapy for resistant CMV | - Effective against ganciclovir-resistant strains [^116m1MoX] <br/> - Poor CNS penetration <br/> - Monitor for taste disturbance and drug interactions [^114T4Thw] |
| Foscarnet | Pyrophosphate analog inhibitor of DNA polymerase | Alternative therapy | - Nephrotoxicity <br/> - Electrolyte disturbances <br/> - Requires IV administration [^115tXfRR] |
| Cidofovir | Nucleotide analog inhibitor of DNA polymerase | Alternative therapy | - Nephrotoxicity <br/> - Requires hydration and probenecid coadministration [^notfound] |
| Letermovir | Terminase complex inhibitor | Not recommended for treatment due to low barrier to resistance | Reserved for prophylaxis in high-risk transplant recipients [^117Vg7HG] |

## Clinical evidence supporting maribavir

In the SOLSTICE trial, **maribavir achieved significantly higher rates of CMV viremia clearance** (55.7% vs 23.9%) compared to investigator-assigned therapy (ganciclovir, valganciclovir, foscarnet, or cidofovir) in transplant recipients with resistant or refractory CMV infection [^112v47rp]. Maribavir was associated with **lower rates of renal impairment and neutropenia** than comparator therapies, making it a safer option for many patients [^116m1MoX].

---

## Alternative therapies

- **Foscarnet**: Effective against ganciclovir-resistant CMV but associated with significant nephrotoxicity and electrolyte disturbances. Recommended when maribavir is unavailable or contraindicated [^116iiC9r].

- **Cidofovir**: Alternative agent with nephrotoxicity concerns, requiring careful monitoring and hydration protocols [^116iiC9r].

- **Combination therapy**: Ganciclovir plus foscarnet may be considered in severe cases, but evidence for superiority over monotherapy is limited and toxicity is increased [^1128JcAQ].

---

## Adjunctive therapies and supportive care

- **Immunosuppression reduction**: Reducing immunosuppression, when feasible, can enhance viral clearance and reduce recurrence risk [^115tXfRR].

- **Adoptive T-cell therapy**: CMV-specific T-cell infusion is an emerging option for refractory cases, particularly in transplant recipients [^1111XKWz].

- **Supportive care**: Manage adverse effects proactively, including renal function monitoring, electrolyte management, and hematologic support [^111MkRuv].

---

## Duration of therapy and monitoring

Treatment should continue for at least 2–4 weeks after confirmed viral clearance, with **close monitoring** of viral load, clinical symptoms, and adverse effects. Regular follow-up is essential to detect recurrence or resistance emergence [^113donMN].

---

## Emerging therapies and future directions

Brincidofovir is under investigation and may offer an **oral option** with activity against resistant CMV strains. Novel agents targeting viral entry and fusion are in development and may expand future therapeutic options [^1116dNqc] [^112yrCfS].

---

## Special considerations in pediatric and HIV-infected patients

Pediatric patients should receive **weight-based dosing** with careful monitoring for adverse effects; maribavir is approved for patients aged ≥ 12 years and weighing ≥ 35 kg [^111SxQKn]. In HIV-infected patients, **immune reconstitution with antiretroviral therapy** is critical, and foscarnet or cidofovir may be considered if maribavir is unavailable [^116JEcsw].

---

Maribavir is the **preferred first-line therapy** for resistant CMV in immunocompromised patients, with foscarnet and cidofovir as alternatives. Genotypic resistance testing and immunosuppression reduction are essential components of management, and therapy should be individualized based on patient-specific factors and clinical response [^114T4Thw] [^114b9Rh8] [^11351wqQ].

Clinical indications

CMV infection is a serious complication in transplant recipients and other immunocompromised patients. Although the drugs discussed above are effective for most patients in the prevention and treatment of CMV infection, they are each associated with important toxicities, and options are limited for those with resistance to multiple drugs. CMV drug resistance sequencing can help guide therapeutic management in the setting of refractory infection or disease.

Those at highest risk for the development of CMV drug resistance include those with prolonged antiviral drug exposure, high-risk stem cell transplant recipients (donor CMV IgG negative [D−]/recipient positive [R+] and D+/R+), and intestinal, multi-visceral, and lung transplant recipients (especially those D+/R−). Resistance testing is indicated when an at-risk patient has refractory CMV infection or disease, as defined by a > 1 log IU/mL increase in viral load or worsening signs, symptoms, or progression to end-organ disease, after at least 2 weeks of appropriately dosed antiviral therapy. Resistance testing may also be considered when a patient has persistent infection or disease, as defined by a lack of response in viral load or signs and symptoms with appropriate therapy. These definitions are established for trial protocols; although many use them as guidance in the clinical setting, some flexibility should be allowed for unique patient presentations. It is important to wait at least 2 weeks after starting therapeutic (not prophylactic) dosing of the drug to evaluate for treatment refractoriness, as it is common for viral loads to paradoxically increase or remain elevated in the first week after a drug is started. Lastly, though currently available methods have reported limits of detection ranging from 240 to 1,000 IU/mL, drug resistance testing on patients with viral loads < 1,000 IU/mL should be considered with caution, as sequencing results at low viral loads may not be reproducible.

### The search for new therapies for human cytomegalovirus infections [^112yrCfS]. Virus Research (2011). Low credibility.

Ganciclovir (GCV), the therapy of choice for human cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections and foscarnet, a drug used to treat GCV-resistant CMV infections was approved more than twenty years ago. Although cidofovir and a prodrug of GCV have since been added to the armamentarium, a highly effective drug without significant toxicities has yet to be approved. Such a therapeutic agent is required for treatment of immunocompromised hosts and infants, which bear the greatest burden of disease. The modest antiviral activity of existing drugs is insufficient to completely suppress viral replication, which results in the selection of drug-resistant variants that remain pathogenic, continue to replicate, and contribute to disease. Sustained efforts, largely in the biotech industry and academia, have identified highly active lead compounds that have progressed into clinical studies with varying levels of success. A few of these compounds inhibit new molecular targets, remain effective against isolates that have developed resistance to existing therapies, and promise to augment existing therapies. Some of the more promising drugs will be discussed with an emphasis on those progressing to clinical studies. Their antiviral activity both in vitro and in vivo, spectrum of antiviral activity, and mechanism of action will be reviewed to provide an update on the progress of potential new therapies for CMV infections.

Letermovir — use for preemptive therapy (PET) after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT): Its use as monotherapy for PET is not currently recommended due to the lack of supporting data and low barrier for development of resistance in vitro. Approximately 3% of patients who had detectable DNAemia at the time of randomization to letermovir in the phase 3 prophylaxis study required discontinuation of letermovir and initiation of standard PET for clinically significant cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, and the reported incidence of resistance in the phase 3 prophylaxis trial was relatively low; additional studies are needed to define the role for letermovir for PET.

Cytomegalovirus antiviral selection for secondary prophylaxis with documented resistance — persistence varies by mutation; canonical UL97 mutations that confer ganciclovir resistance can persist indefinitely and be selected upon reintroduction of the inciting antiviral(s), yet mutations that affect viral replication may not persist and sometimes the affected anti-CMV agent can be used for secondary prophylaxis after the R/R CMV is controlled (C-III).

American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy Series #11 — updated cytomegalovirus (CMV) guidelines target hematopoietic cell transplant and cellular therapy recipients and describe scope, format, and grading. The Practice Guidelines Committee partnered with the Transplant Infectious Diseases Special Interest Group to update previous guidance for the prevention and management of CMV infection and disease following hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Each standalone topic is published as frequently asked questions (FAQs), and adult and pediatric infectious diseases and HCT content experts developed the FAQs and the answers; recommendations were graded according to their strength (A–E) and the level of the supporting evidence (I–III). Prior updates published in 2021 focused on prevention and management, including refractory and resistant infections, and several advances in CMV prevention and management since 2021 warranted an update.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis — antiviral resistance and laboratory assessment: Drug resistance occurs with long-term anti-CMV therapy, with rates of approximately 25% per person-year in the pre-ART era and lower (approximately 5% per person-year) in the ART era. Low-level resistance to ganciclovir occurs through mutations in the CMV UL97 gene, high-level resistance to ganciclovir typically occurs because of mutations in both the CMV UL97 and UL54 genes, and resistance to foscarnet or cidofovir occurs because of mutations in the CMV UL54 gene; high-level resistance to ganciclovir often is associated with cross resistance to cidofovir and occasionally to foscarnet. Because resistant CMV most often involves CMV UL97 mutations and few mutations account for most drug resistance, susceptibility testing in peripheral blood using a CMV DNA PCR assay and sequencing for CMV UL97 mutations or a point mutation assay may be reasonable for patients who relapse on therapy; the virus in the eye and in the blood are identical in more than 90% of cases. Sequencing the UL97 gene from PCR-amplified blood specimens can be accomplished in less than 48 hours and correlates well with conventional drug susceptibility testing and clinical outcomes; by themselves, peripheral blood CMV viral load measurements have poor positive predictive value for treatment failure. UL97 mutants usually respond to foscarnet, as do some UL54 mutants; patients with high-level ganciclovir-resistant isolates will require a switch to alternative therapy, and many clinicians will treat with a series of intravitreal injections of foscarnet and/or systemic foscarnet (CIII).

### Definitions of resistant and refractory cytomegalovirus infection and disease in transplant recipients for use in clinical trials [^1144GQ52]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Despite advances in preventive strategies, cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection remains a major complication in solid organ and hematopoietic cell transplant recipients. CMV infection may fail to respond to commercially available antiviral therapies, with or without demonstrating genotypic mutation(s) known to be associated with resistance to these therapies. This lack of response has been termed "resistant/refractory CMV" and is a key focus of clinical trials of some investigational antiviral agents. To provide consistent criteria for future clinical trials and outcomes research, the CMV Resistance Working Group of the CMV Drug Development Forum (consisting of scientists, clinicians, regulatory officials, and industry representatives from the United States, Canada, and Europe) has undertaken establishing standardized consensus definitions of "resistant" and "refractory" CMV. These definitions have emerged from the Working Group's review of the available virologic and clinical literature and will be subject to reassessment and modification based on results of future studies.

### Approach to drug-resistant cytomegalovirus in transplant recipients [^115uGqRc]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The purpose of this study is to provide updated information on diagnosis of cytomegalovirus (CMV) drug resistance, treatments for drug-resistant infection and potential uses of experimental antiviral compounds.

Recent Findings

For established CMV antivirals, uncommon viral UL97 kinase and UL54 DNA polymerase drug resistance mutations are sporadically described that expand an extensive existing database. Some novel mutations reported from treated patients have no drug-resistant phenotype and may be genotyping artefacts. Next-generation sequencing technology may enable earlier detection of emerging resistance mutations in treated patients. Management options for drug-resistant infection include optimization of host defenses, antiviral dose escalation, substitutions or combinations of standard or experimental antivirals. Maribavir and letermovir have antiviral targets distinct from the classic DNA polymerase. UL97 mutations elicited by ganciclovir and maribavir are different, although a single p-loop mutation can confer significant cross-resistance. High-grade resistance mutations in the UL56 terminase gene are readily selected in vitro under letermovir and await clinical correlation.

Summary

Technical advancements can enhance the accurate and timely genotypic detection of drug resistance. Antivirals undergoing clinical trial offer the prospect of new viral targets and drug combinations, but unresolved issues exist with regard to their therapeutic potential for drug-resistant CMV and their genetic barriers to resistance.

Cytomegalovirus management — role of (val)ganciclovir therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM): There is insufficient evidence to recommend routine use of (val)ganciclovir TDM (D-III) and it is not readily available at least in the US; although TDM may detect under- or overdosing, trough and peak plasma concentration levels do not correlate with clinical efficacy, myelotoxicity, or change in the incidence of R/R CMV infections.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^111TfXSx]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) antiviral resistance — rates and mechanisms indicate that in the pre-ART era, resistance may have developed at approximately 25% per person-year, whereas in the ART era the 1-year incidence appears lower at approximately 5% per person-year. Low-level resistance to ganciclovir occurs through CMV UL97 mutations, while high-level resistance to ganciclovir typically involves mutations in both CMV UL97 and UL54; resistance to foscarnet or cidofovir occurs because of CMV UL54 mutations. High-level resistance to ganciclovir often is associated with cross-resistance to cidofovir and occasionally to foscarnet. Early progression of CMV disease within 2 months after starting anti-CMV drugs is typically not a result of resistance, but late CMV reactivation after many months of treatment may be due to resistance.

### Consensus definitions of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and disease in transplant patients including resistant and refractory CMV for use in clinical trials: 2024 update from the transplant associated virus infections forum [^112MFmqF]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

(See the Editorial Commentary by Cuellar-Rodriguez and van Duin on pages 795–6.)

Definitions of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and disease in patients who have undergone transplantation were initially developed and published after the 4th International CMV Conference in Paris in 1993 and have been updated 3 times. Definitions for resistant and refractory CMV infection and disease were published in 2019. These have since been used in clinical trials and cited more than 760 times (source: Google Scholar; accessed 10 March 2024).

Several developments have resulted in the need for another update. These definitions can also be used, when appropriate, to design trials in individuals with other severe immunocompromised conditions, such as those who have undergone Chimeric Antigen Recepter (CAR) T-cell therapy. Furthermore, the experience of clinical trialists who use the previous definitions, as well as from adjudication committees for such trials, has actualized the need for an update.

The Transplantation Associated Virus Infections Forum was created in 2014 (as the CMV Forum) and is based on the Forum for Collaborative Research model, which is a neutral, independent venue for all stakeholders to engage in dialogue and deliberation to advance regulatory science in disease-specific areas. A CMV Disease Definitions Working Subgroup reviewed the previously published documents and proposed changes based on new developments. Advice was sought from stakeholders who used these definitions in clinical trials.

### Immunocompromised hosts: perspectives in the treatment and prophylaxis of cytomegalovirus disease in solid-organ transplant recipients [^112N3PRo]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is an important complication of solid-organ transplantation. The availability of potent antiviral therapies has decreased the incidence of CMV disease among solid-organ transplant recipients but has also led to challenges, including ganciclovir resistance, late-onset CMV disease, and uncertainty about the optimal duration of prophylaxis or therapy for CMV disease. Specific therapies and management of CMV resistance will be addressed here. The best approach for CMV disease in solid-organ transplant recipients is prevention, but which strategy — prophylaxis or preemptive therapy — is optimal remains debatable. Ganciclovir and valganciclovir remain the best options for prevention and treatment of CMV disease in solid-organ transplant recipients, but they are costly and associated with toxicity. Foscarnet and cidofovir, indicated for the treatment of patients who fail to respond to ganciclovir, are less attractive alternatives because of renal toxicity. Therefore, new therapeutic agents for CMV and an immunogenic, safe CMV vaccine are critically needed.

Post-transplant CMV monitoring and maribavir use in pediatric recipients — Published pediatric data note antiviral resistance rates ranging from 4% with prospective monitoring up to 11.5% in recipients with T‑cell depletion and CMV DNAemia levels greater than or equal to 400 copies/mL after transplant. The US-FDA indication of maribavir for treatment of post-transplant R/R CMV infection includes pediatric patients 12 years or older who weigh at least 35 kg, although no patients younger than 18 years were enrolled in the pivotal trial. A population pharmacokinetic modeling and simulation study supports utilizing adult maribavir dosing for adolescents. For patients 12 years and older who weigh at least 35 kg, standard maribavir dosing for R/R CMV infection was recommended (A‑I), whereas for children younger than 12 years, maribavir use can be considered, but further data are required to inform appropriate dosing (C‑III). A phase 3 study of maribavir in pediatric HCT and solid organ transplant recipients is underway (NCT05319353).

HUMAN CYTOMEGALOVIRUS

Drugs and mechanisms of resistance

The drugs used for CMV treatment and prophylaxis overlap with those used for HSV, with ganciclovir (oral prodrug valganciclovir) replacing acyclovir due to its greater specificity for the CMV UL97 kinase (UL97 gene). The UL97 kinase catalyzes the initial phosphorylation of ganciclovir that leads to the formation of its active form, ganciclovir triphosphate, which terminates DNA synthesis through the competitive inhibition of CMV DNA polymerase (UL54 gene). Cidofovir and foscarnet are also used to treat CMV, with a mechanism of action on CMV DNA polymerase similar to that of HSV. Two additional more recently approved anti-CMV drugs are maribavir and letermovir. Maribavir inhibits the UL97 kinase, which is also responsible for a variety of other cellular functions that promote CMV survival. Letermovir inhibits the terminase complex (formed by UL56, UL89, and UL51 gene products), responsible for viral packaging.

Abstract

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and disease are important causes of morbidity and mortality in transplant recipients. For the purpose of developing consistent reporting of CMV outcomes in clinical trials, definitions of CMV infection and disease were developed and most recently published in 2017. Since then, there have been major developments, including registration of new antiviral agents. Therefore, the Transplant Associated Virus Infections Forum, which consists of scientists, clinicians, regulators, and industry representatives, has produced an updated version of these definitions that incorporates recent knowledge with the aim of supporting clinical research and drug development. This also includes an update regarding the definition of resistant and refractory CMV infections previously published in 2019. As the field evolves, the need for updates of these definitions is clear, and collaborative efforts among clinicians, scientists, regulators, and industry representatives can provide a platform for this work.

### How I treat resistant cytomegalovirus infection in hematopoietic cell transplantation recipients [^115xSJGH]. Blood (2016). Low credibility.

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is a significant complication in hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) recipients. Four antiviral drugs are used for preventing or treating CMV: ganciclovir, valganciclovir, foscarnet, and cidofovir. With prolonged and repeated use of these drugs, CMV can become resistant to standard therapy, resulting in increased morbidity and mortality, especially in HCT recipients. Antiviral drug resistance should be suspected when CMV viremia (DNAemia or antigenemia) fails to improve or continue to increase after 2 weeks of appropriately dosed and delivered antiviral therapy. CMV resistance is diagnosed by detecting specific genetic mutations. UL97 mutations confer resistance to ganciclovir and valganciclovir, and a UL54 mutation confers multidrug resistance. Risk factors for resistance include prolonged or previous anti-CMV drug exposure or inadequate dosing, absorption, or bioavailability. Host risk factors include type of HCT and degree of immunosuppression. Depending on the genotyping results, multiple strategies can be adopted to treat resistant CMV infections, albeit no randomized clinical trials exist so far, after reducing immunosuppression (if possible): ganciclovir dose escalation, ganciclovir and foscarnet combination, and adjunct therapy such as CMV-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte infusions. Novel therapies such as maribavir, brincidofovir, and letermovir should be further studied for treatment of resistant CMV.

### Cytomegalovirus in pediatric hematopoietic stem cell transplantation: a case-based panel discussion of current challenges [^113iJtAC]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2018). Low credibility.

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) remains a significant contributor to morbidity and death after pediatric solid and stem cell transplantation. Decisions regarding prevention and treatment often lack pediatric-specific data to drive decision making. We present here a case-based discussion around some of these specific topics and focus on approaches to CMV prevention, post-CMV secondary prophylaxis options, and identification and treatment of resistant CMV infection, including emerging antiviral agents and the use of cytotoxic CMV-specific T-cells, in the setting of pediatric hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

### Analysis of mutations in the gene encoding cytomegalovirus DNA polymerase in a phase 2 clinical trial of brincidofovir prophylaxis [^1116dNqc]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Brincidofovir is an oral antiviral in development for prevention of cytomegalovirus disease. Cytomegalovirus genotyping results from a phase 2 trial comparing brincidofovir to placebo for prophylaxis against cytomegalovirus infection in hematopoietic cell transplant recipients provided initial data on the clinical resistance profile for brincidofovir. In this study, no known resistance-associated mutations were detected in brincidofovir-treated subjects; identified genotypic substitutions did not confer resistance to cytomegalovirus antivirals in vitro, suggesting that these changes represent polymorphisms unrelated to brincidofovir resistance. Lack of evidence for genotypic resistance during prophylaxis suggests that first-line use of brincidofovir for prevention of cytomegalovirus infection may preserve downstream options for patients.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^1172ZHLF]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Cytomegalovirus — treatment of CMV disease in children with HIV: Treatment with antiviral therapy against CMV in addition to antiretroviral therapy (ART) is recommended for CMV disease in children with HIV (strong, moderate). Intravenous (IV) ganciclovir is the drug of choice for initial treatment of acquired CMV disease, including retinitis and other end‑organ disseminated CMV disease (e.g., colitis, esophagitis, and CNS disease). Transition from IV ganciclovir to oral valganciclovir can be considered for patients who improve on IV therapy (strong, moderate). Foscarnet is an alternative drug for treating CMV disease or for use in ganciclovir‑resistant CMV infections in children with HIV (strong, moderate). Combination therapy with ganciclovir and foscarnet may delay progression of retinitis in certain patients in whom monotherapy fails and can be used as initial therapy in children with sight‑threatening disease (weak, very low).

Cytomegalovirus prophylaxis after hematopoietic cell transplantation — primary prophylaxis refers to initiating an antiviral like letermovir before any clinical or laboratory evidence of CMV, whereas secondary CMV prophylaxis (maintenance) starts after successful completion of CMV pre-emptive or disease treatment to prevent recurrence; secondary prophylaxis should begin when viral loads are undetectable or below the lower limit of detection and risk factors persist, letermovir has been used for secondary prophylaxis in R/R infections, and if oral therapy is unfeasible, intravenous ganciclovir (B-II) or foscarnet can be given, taking the resistance profile into consideration (C-III).

### Antiviral drug resistance in herpesviruses other than cytomegalovirus [^117LbBgT]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2014). Low credibility.

The discovery of acyclovir (ACV), a nucleoside analogue, more than 30years ago, represents a milestone in the management of HSV and VZV infections. The modest activity of ACV against CMV prompted the development of another nucleoside analogue, ganciclovir, for the management of systemic and organ-specific CMV diseases. Second-line agents such as the pyrophosphate analogue foscarnet and the nucleotide analogue cidofovir have been approved subsequently. In contrast to ACV and ganciclovir, the latter drugs do not require selective phosphorylation by viral protein kinases to be converted into their active forms. Since the introduction of these antivirals, the emergence of drug-resistant mutants has been constantly reported particularly in severely immunocompromised patients such as bone marrow and solid organ transplant recipients as well as HIV-infected individuals. In this manuscript, we discuss the characteristics of the antiviral agents currently approved for the management of HSV, VZV and CMV diseases. In recent years, the resistance of CMV to antiviral drugs has been extensively reviewed. The emergence of antiviral drug resistance is also observed with other members of the Herpesviridae family, namely HSV-1, HSV-2, VZV and HHV-6, which are the focus of this review. More specifically, we describe the laboratory methods for assessing drug susceptibilities, the frequency and clinical significance of drug-resistant infections and their management.

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) resistant/refractory infection after hematopoietic cell transplantation — treatment selection guidance states: We recommend that treatment of R/R CMV infection be done in consultation with an infectious disease specialist (A-III). Antiviral selection is individualized based on resistance genotype, prior drug exposure/failure, viremia and disease progression; ganciclovir is the medication most commonly associated with CMV resistance due to UL97 mutations. If high-level UL97-resistant mutations are detected (> 5-fold increase in ganciclovir IC50) we recommend a switch to foscarnet (B-III), whereas certain low-level UL97 mutations (M460I, C592, L595W) may be amenable to higher-dose ganciclovir (7.5–10mg/kg q12h) (B-III). Preemptive use of foscarnet therapy may minimize progression in high-dose ganciclovir dosing (B-I). UL54 polymerase mutations may indicate second-line agents or cross-resistance to ganciclovir, foscarnet and cidofovir. Where possible, seek special access or clinical trials for investigational antiviral agents (C-III). In a recent randomized trial, maribavir was more effective and safer than investigator-assigned treatment for R/R CMV with viral clearance at 8 weeks 55.7% vs 23.9% (p < 0.001), but maribavir is yet to receive FDA/EMA approval and is only available through an early access program. At present, there is insufficient data to recommend using letermovir monotherapy in R/R CMV infection, and limited data suggests letermovir alone or in combination may achieve virologic suppression if viral load < 1000 IU/mL, although results were mixed when initiated at higher viral loads.

### Human cytomegalovirus DNA replication: antiviral targets and drugs [^1161rhUR]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2007). Low credibility.

Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection is associated with severe morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised individuals, in particular transplant recipients and AIDS patients, and is the most frequent congenital viral infection in humans. There are currently five drugs approved for HCMV treatment: ganciclovir and its prodrug valganciclovir, foscarnet, cidofovir and fomivirsen. These drugs have provided a major advance in HCMV disease management, but they suffer from poor bioavailability, significant toxicity and limited effectiveness, mainly due to the development of drug resistance. Fortunately, there are several novel and potentially very effective new compounds which are under pre-clinical and clinical evaluation and may address these limitations. This review focuses on HCMV proteins that are directly or indirectly involved in viral DNA replication and represent already established or potential novel antiviral targets, and describes both currently available drugs and new compounds against such protein targets.

Pediatric HIV — cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease treatment with antivirals plus antiretroviral therapy (ART) is addressed as follows: Treatment with antiviral therapy against CMV in addition to ART is recommended for CMV disease in children with HIV (strong, moderate), with IV ganciclovir the drug of choice for initial treatment for acquired CMV disease, and transition from IV ganciclovir to oral valganciclovir can be considered for patients who improve on IV therapy (strong, moderate). Foscarnet is an alternative drug for treating CMV disease or for use in ganciclovir-resistant CMV infections in children with HIV (strong, moderate). Combination therapy with ganciclovir and foscarnet may delay progression of retinitis when monotherapy fails and can be used as initial therapy in children with sight-threatening disease (weak, very low), and combination IV ganciclovir and foscarnet may also be preferable as initial therapy to stabilize CMV neurologic disease and maximize response (weak, very low). In children with HIV and symptomatic congenital CMV infection, treatment with valganciclovir (or IV ganciclovir) for 6 months is recommended provided it can be started during the first month of life (strong, moderate), based on studies among children with symptomatic congenital CMV infection but without HIV. Treatment of CMV disease in children with HIV has not been studied rigorously, most experts recommend CMV antiviral therapy until end-organ disease is controlled and immune reconstitution is achieved, and no pediatric studies have compared the rates of disease remission and mortality with anti-CMV therapy plus ART versus ART alone.

### CMV: prevention, diagnosis and therapy [^112vRcdU]. American Journal of Transplantation (2013). Low credibility.

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the most common infection after organ transplantation and has a major impact on morbidity, mortality and graft survival. Optimal prevention, diagnosis and treatment of active CMV infection enhance transplant outcomes, and are the focus of this section. Methods to prevent CMV include universal prophylaxis and preemptive therapy; each has its merits, and will be compared and contrasted. Diagnostics have improved substantially in recent years, both in type and quality, allowing for more accurate and savvy treatment; advances in diagnostics include the development of an international standard, which should allow comparison of results across different methodologies, and assays for cellular immune function against CMV. Therapy primarily involves ganciclovir, now rendered more versatile by data suggesting oral therapy with valganciclovir is not inferior to intravenous therapy with ganciclovir. Treatment of resistant virus remains problematic, but is enhanced by the availability of multiple novel therapeutic agents.

Pediatric cytomegalovirus (CMV) after hematopoietic cell transplantation — In severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), one study found that 7% of infants with SCID were diagnosed with CMV infection, and CMV disease in SCID is often fatal with prolonged therapy and higher risk of antiviral resistance. Children follow the recommendations for all ages for CMV monitoring and treatment, and management of resistant/refractory (R/R) CMV infection should follow the algorithm for all ages. Limited pediatric data report approximately 4% of children developing antiviral resistance after two months of prolonged antiviral therapy. Ganciclovir TDM may be considered in young children following HCT (C-III). Letermovir prophylaxis is not approved in children under 18 years; a clinical trial in neonates to adolescents (< 18 years) is underway to evaluate pharmacokinetics (NCT03945086).

### Maribavir for refractory cytomegalovirus infections with or without resistance post-transplant: results from a phase 3 randomized clinical trial [^114tgXG6]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

The choice of specific IAT was at the investigators' discretion and could include mono- or combination therapy (≤ 2 drugs) with intravenous (IV) ganciclovir, oral valganciclovir, IV foscarnet, or IV cidofovir (Supplementary Methods). Switching between ganciclovir and valganciclovir was permitted. A maribavir rescue arm was an option for patients originally assigned IAT after 3 or more weeks of treatment upon medical monitor confirmation of meeting 1 of 3 prespecified criteria (Supplementary Methods).

The study was conducted in accordance with International Conference on Harmonisation of Good Clinical Practice guidelines and the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Institutional review boards/independent ethics committees at each center approved the trial. All patients/legal guardians provided written informed consent.

Endpoints and Assessments

The primary endpoint was confirmed CMV viremia clearance at the end of week 8 (regardless of premature treatment discontinuation). Confirmed viremia clearance was defined as plasma CMV DNA level below the lower limit of quantification (< 137 IU/mL) in 2 consecutive post-baseline samples, separated by 5 or more days, performed at the central laboratory using COBAS AmpliPrep/COBAS TaqMan CMV Test (Roche Diagnostics). Patients who received maribavir rescue or alternative anti-CMV treatment before the end of week 8, or who failed to achieve confirmed CMV viremia clearance at week 8 (including missing virologic data), were considered nonresponders.

The key secondary endpoint was a composite of confirmed CMV viremia clearance and symptom control at the end of week 8, maintained through week 16 (8 weeks beyond the treatment phase) after receiving exclusively study-assigned treatment. Symptom control was defined as resolution/improvement of CMV disease/syndrome for patients symptomatic at baseline or absence of the development of CMV disease/syndrome for patients asymptomatic at baseline. Cytomegalovirus disease/syndrome was assessed by the investigator using the classification in Ljungman et al; assessments were adjudicated by an independent, blinded EAC. Additional secondary and exploratory endpoints and study assessment details are within the Supplementary Methods.

Safety endpoints included treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and serious TEAEs (TESAEs).

### Consensus definitions of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and disease in transplant patients including resistant and refractory CMV for use in clinical trials: 2024 update from the transplant associated virus infections forum [^111YBAVt]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

DEFINITIONS

Definitions of CMV Infection

These definitions are unchanged from the previous version (Supplementary Material).

CMV Detection in Blood

It is recognized that CMV DNA detection by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) on peripheral blood samples ("CMV DNAemia") is associated with mortality in hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients. CMV DNAemia does not necessarily mean that active CMV replication is occurring. This is supported by the detection of so-called CMV DNA blips that occur in HCT patients on letermovir prophylaxis but can be found under other circumstances. A "blip" is characterized by single detections of CMV DNA, usually with low viral load, and might represent either incomplete viral replication or immune system clearance of CMV.

Clinically Significant CMV Infection

The concept of clinically significant CMV infection has been recognized by regulatory authorities as an acceptable end point in a pivotal study of antiviral prophylaxis in HCT recipients. This end point was defined as either the occurrence of CMV disease or the initiation of anti-CMV preemptive therapy based on prespecified CMV DNAemia thresholds. Currently, this end point is not acceptable in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients.

### Update in management of ganciclovir-resistant cytomegalovirus infection [^113KUTMb]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The present review summarizes recent developments in pathogenesis, prevention, and management of ganciclovir-resistant cytomegalovirus infection.

Recent Findings

Basic science advances include reports of new resistance mutations and multidrug resistance. Innovative studies of the host immune response have shed light on differential risk. New laboratory techniques include rapid assays for resistance and measurement of ganciclovir levels. Clinical developments include studies on ganciclovir-resistant cytomegalovirus infection in thoracic transplant recipients and aspects of cytomegalovirus infection prevention. Although no resistance was seen in the valganciclovir arm of a prophylaxis trial, resistance has been described after both prophylactic and preemptive valganciclovir therapy. In the HIV realm, the incidence of ganciclovir-resistant cytomegalovirus infection has fallen dramatically. Newer options for therapy include maribavir, leflunomide, high-dose ganciclovir, switching to a sirolimus-based regimen, and the antimalarial drug, artesunate.

Summary

Antiviral-resistant cytomegalovirus infection remains a feared complication of transplantation but is less frequently seen in AIDS patients in the current era. New research on resistance mutations and pathogenesis has enhanced clinical understanding of risk. Although preemptive strategies and valganciclovir prophylaxis are associated with less resistance than oral ganciclovir, resistant cytomegalovirus infection has not been eliminated. Several strategies and newer drugs hold promise for the future.

Children after HCT — key CMV management considerations include that children are more likely than adults to be CMV-seronegative at HCT and may have a higher chance of experiencing primary CMV infection than reactivation; in infants, IgG positivity may reflect passively transferred maternal antibodies; breast milk from CMV‑seropositive mothers most commonly tests positive (40% intermittently) for CMV and infects approximately two‑thirds of exposed infants around birth but healthy term infants rarely become symptomatic; breastfeeding recommendations vary, with the most common (48%) being to restrict breastfeeding to CMV‑seronegative mothers (B‑III).

### Consensus definitions of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and disease in transplant patients including resistant and refractory CMV for use in clinical trials: 2024 update from the transplant associated virus infections forum [^112uMSuu]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

It is important in the clinical trial setting to perform resistance testing in a structured way. The classification of mutations may evolve with addition of information, and confidence in the published data rises in proportion to the number of independent studies with the same mutation. With the introduction of new antiviral drugs for which the experience is still limited, it is important to perform resistance testing to increase the knowledge base for future patient management.

In the process of updating these definitions, it became clear that additional research is needed. Topics include a better definition of the role of CMV qPCR testing on BAL fluid in the diagnosis of CMV pneumonia, as well as the role of other factors that affect quantitation of CMV in BAL. Regarding CMV disease, use of qPCR in tissue and the role of CMV viral load in stool need to be investigated. The association of a persistently high or increasing viral load during antiviral treatment, refractory CMV infection, needs to be systematically investigated. Finally, studies are needed to understand if these definitions can be applied in other settings.

### Clinical and biologic aspects of human cytomegalovirus resistance to antiviral drugs [^111T8vjb]. Human Immunology (2004). Low credibility.

The emergence of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) drug resistant strains is a life-threatening condition in immunocompromised individuals with active HCMV infection. HCMV drug resistance represented a major problem in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome until the recent introduction of highly active antiretroviral combination therapy, which dramatically decreased the incidence in this clinical setting. However, HCMV resistance to antiviral drugs is now an emerging problem in the transplantation setting. The molecular mechanisms of HCMV drug resistance have been elucidated and rely on the selection during treatment of HCMV strains harboring mutations in two key viral genes: UL97 coding for a viral phosphotransferase and UL54 coding for the viral DNA polymerase.

### Cytomegalovirus in immunocompromised children [^116m8bj5]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The purpose of this study is to explore the latest developments in the risk factors, prevention and treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in immunocompromised children, including those with congenital immunodeficiency or iatrogenic immune suppression related to solid organ transplantation (SOT) or haematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT).

Recent Findings

CMV viral load measurements now have international standards, allowing for more reliable comparison across sites and within individuals. Preemptive and prophylactic therapy with routine CMV monitoring in transplant patients has yielded significant reduction in CMV morbidity and mortality in these patients. The majority of U.S. states have adopted routine newborn screening for severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). Viral infections, including CMV, are a major obstacle preventing optimal curative transplantation in these patients. Several new antiviral agents are currently being investigated for CMV infection in immunocompromised patients. Knowledge on CMV drug resistance in children is emerging and requires further study.

Summary

Conditions that diminish cell-mediated immunity impact the development of CMV infection and disease. These conditions include certain congenital immunodeficiencies and SOT and HCT. Infants identified as having SCID should be screened for CMV risk factors. A preemptive or prophylactic strategy should be chosen for CMV management in children who are high risk posttransplantation. In those who develop disease, viral loads should be monitored and resistance testing considered if response is not deemed adequate. Oral valganciclovir is being used as an alternative to ganciclovir in children, although pharmacokinetic data are limited. Other oral antiviral agents under development are promising future options for paediatric CMV therapy.

### American society for transplantation and cellular therapy series # 11: updated cytomegalovirus guidelines in hematopoietic cell transplant and cellular therapy recipients [^111Rn9fr]. Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

The Practice Guidelines Committee of the American Society of Transplantation and Cellular Therapy partnered with the society's Transplant Infectious Diseases Special Interest Group to update its previous infectious disease guidelines for the prevention and management of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and disease following hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) 1. The two updates, published in 2021, focused on the prevention and management of CMV infection, respectively, including refractory and resistant CMV infections. To best serve clinical providers, each standalone topic in the infectious diseases series has been published in a concise format of frequently asked questions (FAQs). Adult and pediatric infectious diseases and HCT content experts developed the FAQs and the answers; recommendations were graded according to their strength (A-E) and the level of the supporting evidence (I-III). Several advances in CMV prevention and management since 2021 warranted an update to the original third and fourth topics in the series. This eleventh topic in the series focuses on new antiviral treatments for CMV, expanded indications of existing antiviral therapy for the prevention of CMV, and the treatment of CMV in special populations such as CAR T-cell therapy recipients and pediatric transplant recipients.

### Comparative emergence of maribavir and ganciclovir resistance in a randomized phase 3 clinical trial for treatment of cytomegalovirus infection [^111iuEzV]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Effective management of opportunistic human cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is essential for successful outcomes of hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Strategies include antiviral prophylaxis or preemptive treatment of asymptomatic infection. Because of adverse effects of traditional CMV DNA polymerase inhibitor antiviral drugs such as ganciclovir and foscarnet, including myelotoxicity and nephrotoxicity, there has been a welcome for the development of alternative options with different viral drug targets and avoidance of these toxicities. Letermovir, a CMV terminase inhibitor, has been approved for prophylaxis, and maribavir, a viral UL97 kinase inhibitor, has been approved for treatment of refractory CMV infection with or without drug resistance. In a more recent phase 3 randomized trial of maribavir and valganciclovir for treatment of first-episode CMV infection after HCT, the treatment response rate, as defined by confirmed CMV viremia clearance at week 8, for maribavir was 69.6% versus valganciclovir at 77.4%, although fewer maribavir recipients developed neutropenia leading to treatment discontinuation.

A concern about the newer CMV antiviral drugs is their lower genetic barrier to the development of drug resistance, as observed in vitro. The in vivo correlates remain incompletely defined. For example, emergent letermovir resistance in prophylaxis trials was rare; however, case reports document the repeated detection of high-grade resistance mutations in off-label use of letermovir for the treatment of active CMV infection. A phase 3 trial of maribavir for the treatment of refractory CMV infection (with or without drug resistance) revealed emergent maribavir resistance in 26% of treated patients, but a direct comparison of incidence with standard polymerase inhibitors was prevented by a history of extensive prior exposure to these drugs and differences in duration of drug exposure. The more recent randomized phase 3 trial of maribavir and valganciclovir as preemptive treatment after HCT offered a better opportunity to evaluate any differences in emergent drug resistance after treatment with either drug, because prior antiviral drug exposure was limited and patients received comparable durations of study drug. A drug resistance analysis of this trial is reported here.

HCT CMV resistance — diagnostic testing guidance states that genotype assays are commonly used to confirm resistance associated mutations and testing is recommended when CMV viral loads fail to decline by > 1 log10 after more than 2 weeks of appropriately dosed antivirals in suspected disease or with repeatedly increasing viral load; if resistance is suspected, we recommend testing the plasma specimen when feasible (A-III), and during letermovir prophylaxis, consultation with an infectious disease specialist is recommended for resistance testing when CMV DNAemia < 1000 IU/ml (B-III), noting letermovir resistance may emerge even with relatively short duration of prophylaxis.

Letermovir prophylaxis after hematopoietic cell transplantation — Use of letermovir has led to less clinically significant CMV viremia during prophylaxis. Risk factors for late CMV reactivation after discontinuation of prophylaxis include GVHD, high dose corticosteroids, cord blood or T-cell depleted allografts, and mismatched or haploidentical donors. A phase 3 study is currently underway to assess if these high-risk patients would benefit from extending prophylaxis to 6 months post-HCT (NCT03930615). By allowing CMV antigen presentation, letermovir may promote CMV immune reconstitution even without clinical viremia. R/R CMV and tissue invasive CMV diseases were uncommon in the letermovir clinical trial, and real-world data showed an 85% reduction in R/R CMV with use of primary letermovir prophylaxis.

Revised Definitions of Refractory CMV Infection/Disease for Use in Clinical Trials

We consolidated the 2 categories of refractory and probable refractory CMV infection/disease into 1 category.

Refractory CMV infection: Defined as CMV viremia (DNAemia or antigenemia) that increases (ie, > 1 log 10 increase in CMV DNA levels in the same blood compartment from the peak viral load as measured in the same laboratory and/or with the same commercial assay) OR persists (≤ 1 log 10 increase or decrease in CMV DNA levels) after at least 2 weeks of appropriate antiviral therapy.

Refractory CMV end-organ disease: Defined by a worsening in signs and symptoms or progression to end-organ disease (for a patient not previously diagnosed with CMV end-organ disease) OR lack of improvement in signs and symptoms after at least 2 weeks of appropriately dosed antiviral therapy.

Rationale: To mirror real-world practices and improve clinical trials enrollment, we consolidated the definitions of refractory and probable refractory into 1 definition for both CMV infection and end-organ disease.

Limitations: Certain CMV end-organ diseases (eg, CMV retinitis and GI diseases) are not always associated with measurable viral loads in serum or whole blood. In these cases, CMV may be replicating locally at tissue sites and may not be recovered for resistance testing.

### How I treat CMV reactivation after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation [^112cu6Zg]. Blood (2020). Medium credibility.

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation remains one of the most common and life-threatening infectious complications following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, despite novel diagnostic technologies, several novel prophylactic agents, and further improvements in preemptive therapy and treatment of established CMV disease. Treatment decisions for CMV reactivation are becoming increasingly difficult and must take into account whether the patient has received antiviral prophylaxis, the patient's individual risk profile for CMV disease, CMV-specific T-cell reconstitution, CMV viral load, and the potential drug resistance detected at the time of initiation of antiviral therapy. Thus, we increasingly use personalized treatment strategies for the recipient of an allograft with CMV reactivation based on prior use of anti-CMV prophylaxis, viral load, the assessment of CMV-specific T-cell immunity, and the molecular assessment of resistance to antiviral drugs.

### Current and emerging antiviral agents in the prevention and treatment of cytomegalovirus in pediatric transplant recipients [^115Wr2Mo]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). Medium credibility.

Despite current prophylaxis regimens, cytomegalovirus (CMV) is common in hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) and solid organ transplantation (SOT) and remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Newer antiviral medications are reshaping the landscape for prevention and treatment of CMV DNAemia, infection, and disease. Letermovir is approved for CMV prevention in adult HCT patients and is attractive due to the absence of marrow suppression seen with ganciclovir/valganciclovir. Letermovir should not be routinely used for CMV treatment due to its low threshold for resistance. Maribavir is approved for the treatment of refractory or resistant CMV disease in HCT and SOT recipients ≥ 12 years of age, though it has no current role in CMV prevention. More research is needed to fully elucidate the roles, efficacy, and safety of these newer agents in prevention and treatment of CMV in pediatric transplant recipients.

### Cytomegalovirus (CMV) resistance to antivirals [^112P842m]. American Journal of Transplantation (2001). Low credibility.

This article reviews the biology of cytomegalovirus (CMV), the approved antiviral therapies, and mechanisms of resistance to these drugs. The rates of resistance development in clinical trials are presented, as are the assays for testing susceptibility by phenotypic and genotypic methods. Factors that favor the development of clinical and in vitro antiviral resistance are discussed. Finally, approaches to altering antiviral therapy as resistance develops are outlined.

### Consensus definitions of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and disease in transplant patients including resistant and refractory CMV for use in clinical trials: 2024 update from the transplant associated virus infections forum [^116aG9wA]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Several new interventions including antiviral drugs, vaccines, and virus-specific T cells to prevent or treat CMV infection and/or disease are in development. For meaningful comparison of clinical outcomes, clinical studies of new agents or strategies should use common (standardized) definitions. An update of the previous definitions is warranted since transplant practices and diagnostic techniques continue to evolve. Pivotal prophylaxis studies in HCT recipients were performed with a newly defined end point (clinically significant CMV infection), and this is now included in this version of the definitions.

It is unlikely that comparative studies of "old" and "new" diagnostic techniques will be performed since many diagnostic laboratories no longer use classic virus isolation or rapid culture techniques. We have addressed these developments in our definitions of probable CMV pneumonia and probable CMV retinitis. This version of CMV disease definitions has also adapted to the changes in clinical practice as seen in recent clinical trials, namely, that physicians who manage SOT patients often do not perform invasive procedures for patients with CMV detected in blood who present with diarrhea or other symptoms suggestive of GI CMV disease. The classification will make it possible to find differences in outcomes between patients who develop these disease categories in future clinical trials.

In SOT recipients, the probable "CMV syndrome" category is the most frequently documented type of CMV disease. The experience from recently conducted clinical trials has been implemented and the definition somewhat changed to reflect that experience. However, CMV syndrome is not a precisely defined entity; therefore, future development could focus on a scoring system, ultimately establishing a threshold score for this entity.

This document also includes an update of the definitions of resistant and refractory CMV infection that reflects recent developments. Data support the harmful impact of refractory CMV infections with or without genotypic mutations on clinical outcomes, including mortality after SOT and HCT. The working group recognized that clinicians who care for patients at high risk for CMV-associated complications are frequently reluctant to delay changing antiviral therapy when the response is perceived to be suboptimal. Furthermore, resistance testing can take some time to obtain results in routine clinical care. However, since it takes time for many antiviral agents to achieve an antiviral effect given viral kinetics, leading to unnecessary changes in antiviral drugs that can result in negative effects on the patients, we decided that it is important to keep the previous definition of refractory infection requiring at least 2 weeks of appropriately dosed antiviral therapy.

Treatment options for resistant cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection based on genotype are as follows: for UL97 mutations conferring high-level resistance to ganciclovir, Consider foscarnet or maribavir; for UL97 mutations conferring low-level resistance to ganciclovir, Consider maribavir or foscarnet and Consider high-dose ganciclovir as tolerated if CMV end organ disease is not suspected; for UL97 mutations conferring resistance to maribavir, Consider (val)ganciclovir if no mutations conferring cross-resistance are detected and Consider foscarnet if the detected mutations confer cross-resistance to (val)ganciclovir; for UL54 mutations conferring resistance only to foscarnet, Consider ganciclovir or maribavir; for UL54 mutations conferring resistance to foscarnet and ganciclovir (with or without UL97 mutations), Consider maribavir and Seek special access or trial participation for investigational agents or adjunct agents; for UL54 mutations conferring resistance only to ganciclovir and cidofovir, Consider foscarnet or maribavir and Seek special access or trial participation for investigational agents or adjunct agents; for UL54 mutations conferring resistance to ganciclovir, foscarnet, and cidofovir, Consider maribavir and Seek special access or trial participation for investigational agents or adjunct agents; for UL56, UL89, and UL51 mutations conferring resistance to letermovir, Antiviral therapy with ganciclovir or foscarnet is appropriate if CS-CMVI is suspected, as no crossresistance is expected with these 2 agents; for refractory CMV infection without known resistant mutations, directives include Optimize dosing of current antiviral therapy. Use an alternative antiviral agent if available, Reduce immunosuppression if feasible, Consider alternative immunosuppressive agents such as mTOR inhibitors, and Seek special access or trial participation for investigational agents or adjunct agents. Definitions and safety notes include High- and low-level CMV resistance to ganciclovir is defined as mutations that confer 5–15x or 2–5x change in EC50 respectively and Avoid maribavir for CMV retinitis or encephalitis.

### Maribavir for refractory cytomegalovirus infections with or without resistance post-transplant: results from a phase 3 randomized clinical trial [^113nGsWq]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Maribavir was previously investigated for CMV prophylaxis, with prior phase 3 studies showing that the treatment (administered at 100 mg BID) failed to prevent CMV disease in transplant recipients. However, findings from the current phase 3 and phase 2 studies using a higher maribavir dose (400 mg BID) all show maribavir efficacy in clearing CMV viremia among transplant recipients with CMV infection.

Currently, there is no consensus on a CMV viral load cutoff for initiation of therapy; while the CMV DNA cutoff for study inclusion may have excluded some patients, this threshold was selected following discussions with regulatory authorities and in careful consideration towards including patients with clinically significant CMV viremia.

The current study has limitations, including an open-label design, which may have introduced bias. Blinding was not feasible due to the need for individualized IAT drug selection/dosing adjustments and the different routes of treatment administration for IAT compared with maribavir. While this study was designed to include pediatric patients aged 12 years and older, no pediatric patients were enrolled. The benefit of maribavir over IAT was consistent across key subpopulations, including a numerically greater response in patients with refractory CMV without genotyped resistance. However, this study was not powered to detect differences between treatments in this patient subgroup. Further, as patients were not stratified by refractory or resistant CMV at randomization, more patients with refractory-only CMV were included in the maribavir group. Nevertheless, a numerical trend for maribavir versus IAT was observed for this patient subgroup, in alignment with overall study results. A higher study discontinuation rate before week 8 in the IAT group was also observed in the study. These discontinuations were primarily due to adverse events and toxicities known to be associated with available anti-CMV agents. Sensitivity analyses (Supplementary Table 3) were performed to address this potential bias. Finally, the study-specified treatment duration may have necessitated patients with residual CMV at the end of the 8-week treatment phase to receive an alternative treatment during the follow-up phase and who were therefore considered nonresponders to the key secondary endpoint.

### The next frontier: cytomegalovirus antiviral stewardship programs in solid organ transplant [^113ZM2xc]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a driver of negative patient and allograft outcomes after solid organ transplantation (SOT) and new tools are needed to circumvent these outcomes. We will review key elements of CMV antiviral stewardship in SOT, discuss the available evidence for CMV antiviral stewardship programs and feature areas for expansion in the current landscape of CMV management.

Recent Findings

CMV remains a common complication after SOT. While consensus guidelines provide recommendations for the prevention and treatment of CMV, a one-size-fits-all approach is not necessarily appropriate for all unique patients and posttransplant courses, types of SOT recipients and transplant centers. Additionally, consensus guidelines have not been updated since the approval of two new antiviral therapies for the treatment of CMV after SOT or emerging evidence for the incorporation of immune functional assays into clinical practice. From the models provided in recent literature, CMV antiviral stewardship programs have demonstrated efficacy by increasing successful treatment of viremia, optimizing and reducing unnecessary use of (val)ganciclovir for both prophylaxis and treatment, and preventing development of ganciclovir-resistant CMV infections. These models highlight the multidisciplinary approach required of CMV antiviral stewardship programs to provide standardization of management, including incorporation of new therapies and diagnostic tools.

Summary

CMV antiviral stewardship programs represent a promising avenue to considerably improve the management of CMV after SOT. Future studies are needed to evaluate a potential positive impact on graft outcomes and patient survival.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^111rU2xZ]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis treatment failure and resistance management — CMV resistance to ganciclovir and valganciclovir can be conferred by mutations in the viral phosphotransferase gene, UL97, or the viral DNA polymerase gene, UL54, while resistance to foscarnet or cidofovir occurs because of mutations in the UL54 DNA polymerase gene. Resistant strains of CMV should be suspected when progressive disease and continued recovery of virus occurs despite ganciclovir therapy. Viral culture and phenotypic antiviral drug susceptibility testing are not generally available in clinical laboratories, but sequencing of the CMV UL97 and UL54 genes from PCR-amplified specimens may be performed in commercial laboratories, and results of genotypic resistance testing have been shown to correlate with clinical outcomes of ganciclovir treatment in patients with HIV who have CMV retinitis. Foscarnet is the empiric drug of choice when ganciclovir resistance is suspected. In patients with CMV retinitis, early relapse may be caused by the limited intraocular penetration of systemically administered drugs; in adults with HIV whose retinitis has relapsed during systemic treatment, placement of a ganciclovir implant was recommended because it achieved higher drug levels in the eye and often would control the retinitis for 6 to 8 months until the implant required replacement; however, the ganciclovir implant is no longer available from the manufacturer. Early first relapse of retinitis should generally be treated with reinduction with the same drug used for initial treatment, followed by reinstitution of maintenance therapy; however, if drug resistance is suspected or if side effects or toxicities interfere with optimal courses of the initial agent, changing to an alternative drug is reasonable. Combination ganciclovir and foscarnet can be considered, but the combination is associated with greater toxicity.

The Practice Guidelines Committee of the American Society of Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (ASTCT) partnered with its Transpl. Infect. Dis. Special Interest Group (TID-SIG) to update its 2009 compendium-style infectious disease guidelines for hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). A new approach was employed with the goal of better serving clinical providers by publishing each standalone topic in the infectious diseases series as a concise format of frequently asked questions (FAQ), tables, and figures. Adult and pediatric infectious diseases and HCT content experts developed and answered FAQs. Topics were finalized with harmonized recommendations that were made by assigning an A through E strength of recommendation paired with a level of supporting evidence graded I through III. The fourth topic in the series focuses on the management and treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV) resistant and refractory infections. The diagnosis, definitions of resistant and refractory CMV, risk factors, virological genotypes and treatment algorithms are reviewed.

### Immunovirology of cytomegalovirus infection in allogeneic stem cell transplant recipients undergoing prophylaxis with letermovir: a narrative review [^117Vg7HG]. Journal of Medical Virology (2023). Medium credibility.

On November 7, 2017, the US Food and Drug Administration approved the use of letermovir (LMV) for prophylaxis of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in adult CMV-seropositive allogeneic stem cell transplant recipients. After 6 years of use, a large body of real-world experience has been accumulated that validates the Phase III clinical trial results, in which LMV was shown to significantly reduce the risk of clinically significant CMV infection-defined as CMV end-organ disease or CMV DNAemia requiring pre-emptive antiviral therapy (PET)-and increase survival up to Week 24 after treatment inception. Notwithstanding, several issues still need to be settled, thus further investigation is required. First, since viral DNA may accumulate as a result of LMV-driven abortive CMV infection, what is the optimal viral load threshold in the blood that would prompt LMV prophylaxis interruption and PET inception? Should this be adapted to the patient's risk? Second, what is the impact of LMV prophylaxis on the reconstitution of functional CMV-specific T-cell responses? Would it be a wise approach to individually tailor the duration of LMV treatment according to the number of peripheral blood CMV-specific T cells at the end of regular prophylaxis? Third, how frequently do LMV-resistant strains arise while patients are on LMV prophylaxis and how could this be minimized? Here, we discuss the literature addressing these topics.

### Oral antiviral drugs for treatment of cytomegalovirus in transplant recipients [^115tXfRR]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is an opportunistic pathogen responsible for substantial morbidity after solid organ transplantation and haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Treatment of CMV disease involves a two-pronged approach with antiviral drug treatment coupled with strategies to minimize the intensity of immune suppression.

Objectives

This narrative review examines the evidence for the current treatment of CMV disease in transplant recipients, including the use of oral antiviral drugs.

Sources

Literature search was performed on PubMed with keywords cytomegalovirus, transplantation, ganciclovir, valganciclovir, maribavir, letermovir, cidofovir, and foscarnet.

Content

Intravenous and oral valganciclovir are the standard first-line treatment of cytomegalovirus disease after transplantation. Oral maribavir has demonstrated superior efficacy and safety over CMV DNA polymerase inhibitors for the treatment of refractory or resistant CMV infection. Transplant patients with severe and life-threatening CMV disease, those with very high viral load, and patients with impaired gastrointestinal absorption should still be treated initially with intravenous antiviral drugs, including ganciclovir and foscarnet. Criteria for the safe transition from intravenous therapies to oral antiviral drugs include achieving clinical improvement and satisfactory decline in viral load. Recurrence of CMV viremia and disease is common, particularly among transplant patients who are lymphopenic and have impaired CMV-specific immunity.

Implications

Oral antiviral drugs for the treatment of CMV infection and disease in transplant recipients have improved the CMV landscape, because they reduce the cost and mitigate the inconvenience and risks related to prolonged hospitalization and the need for long-term intravascular access. However, their antiviral efficacy should be complemented by an intentional strategy of reducing the degree of immune suppression to allow for immunologic recovery that ensures durable control of CMV infection.

### Prevention and treatment of cytomegalovirus infections in solid organ transplant recipients [^116UoY1w]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Despite advances in prevention and treatment, cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and disease remain an expected problem in solid organ transplant recipients. Because of the effect of immunosuppressing medications, CMV primary, secondary, and reactivated infection requires antiviral medications to prevent serious direct and indirect effects of the virus. Side effects and drug resistance, however, often limit the capacity of traditional antiviral therapies. This article updates the clinician on current and promising approaches to the management and control of CMV in the solid organ transplant recipient.

### Guidelines for the management of cytomegalovirus infection in patients with haematological malignancies and after stem cell transplantation from the 2017 European Conference on Infections in Leukaemia (ECIL 7) [^114EV1GK]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Cytomegalovirus is one of the most important infections to occur after allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), and an increasing number of reports indicate that cytomegalovirus is also a potentially important pathogen in patients treated with recently introduced drugs for hematological malignancies. Expert recommendations have been produced by the 2017 European Conference on Infections in Leukaemia (ECIL 7) after a review of the literature on the diagnosis and management of cytomegalovirus in patients after HSCT and in patients receiving other types of therapy for haematological malignancies. These recommendations cover diagnosis, preventive strategies such as prophylaxis and pre-emptive therapy, and management of cytomegalovirus disease. Antiviral drugs including maribavir and letermovir are in development and prospective clinical trials have recently been completed. However, management of patients with resistant or refractory cytomegalovirus infection or cytomegalovirus disease is a challenge. In this Review we summarise the reviewed literature and the recommendations of the ECIL 7 for management of cytomegalovirus in patients with haematological malignancies.

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) management in pediatric hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients — In the absence of primary prophylaxis, pre-emptive strategy is recommended in pediatric CMV-seropositive allogeneic HCT (A-II). For patients 12 years and older who weigh at least 35 kg, standard maribavir dosing for R/R CMV infection is recommended (A-I). For children younger than 12 years, maribavir can be considered, but further data are needed to inform appropriate dosing (C-III). Management of refractory or resistant CMV infection in children should follow the general recommendations for adult HCT recipients (C-III).

### Clinical aspects of cytomegalovirus antiviral resistance in solid organ transplant recipients [^112zxZbv]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Despite advances in the prophylaxis and acute treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV), it remains an important pathogen affecting the short- and long-term clinical outcome of solid organ transplant. The emergence of CMV resistance in a patient reduces the clinical efficacy of antiviral therapy, complicates therapeutic and clinical management decisions, and in some cases results in loss of the allograft and/or death of the patient. There is increasing use of antiviral prophylaxis after transplant with little expansion in the range of antiviral agents effective in treatment of CMV. Further understanding is needed of the risk factors for development of CMV antiviral resistance and of therapeutic strategies for treating patients infected with resistant viruses. We review the current status of CMV resistance in solid organ transplant recipients, and provide diagnostic and therapeutic suggestions for the clinician in managing antiviral resistance.

Antivirals in development for resistant/refractory CMV — Maribavir is active against CMV including strains resistant to ganciclovir or foscarnet. In a phase 3 randomized trial in HCT recipients, 55.7% versus 23.9% achieved clearance of CMV viremia at completion of the treatment phase, with lower rates of renal impairment versus foscarnet and lower rates of neutropenia versus valganciclovir. Maribavir is effective and well-tolerated but is yet to receive FDA/EMA approval (B-I); because it does not adequately penetrate the CNS it should not be used for CMV encephalitis or retinitis (D-II), and a low level of suspicion for CNS disease is recommended during therapy. Filociclovir (MBX-400) is under phase 1b evaluation with activity against in-vitro CMV resistant strains, and a single institution phase 2 study of letermovir for R/R CMV is enrolling (NCT03728426).

### Human cytomegalovirus: clinical aspects, immune regulation, and emerging treatments [^1112Gs4t]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2004). Medium credibility.

After initial infection, human cytomegalovirus remains in a persistent state with the host. Immunity against the virus controls replication, although intermitent viral shedding can still take place in the seropositive immunocompetent person. Replication of cytomegalovirus in the absence of an effective immune response is central to the pathogenesis of disease. Therefore, complications are primarily seen in individuals whose immune system is immature, or is suppressed by drug treatment or coinfection with other pathogens. Although our increasing knowledge of the host-virus relationship has lead to the development of new pharmacological strategies for cytomegalovirus-associated infections, these strategies all have limitations-eg, drug toxicities, development of resistance, poor oral bioavailability, and low potency. Immune-based therapies to complement pharmacological strategies for the successful treatment of virus-associated complications should be prospectively investigated.

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) remains the most important viral pathogen in patients after allogeneic haematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), resulting in morbidity and mortality. The European Conference on Infections in Leukaemia (ECIL) brings together experts in several fields to produce evidence-based recommendations from comprehensive literature reviews. Management of CMV has been addressed twice before; the previous guideline update from the ECIL was published in 2019. The 10th ECIL meeting in 2024 addressed new developments in CMV management after allogeneic HCT, and recommendations are presented in this Review. Management recommendations include diagnostics, such as immune monitoring, antiviral prophylaxis with letermovir, management of resistant and refractory CMV infections, and paediatric aspects of CMV management. Furthermore, the 10th ECIL introduced recommendations for two new categories: patients treated with chimeric antigen receptor T cells or treated with bispecific T-cell-engaging antibodies.

### Is combination antiviral therapy for CMV superior to monotherapy? [^1128JcAQ]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Many clinicians are under the impression that the combination of ganciclovir (GCV) and foscarnet is synergistic versus cytomegalovirus (CMV) and/or that combination therapy might prevent the emergence of resistance to one or both antivirals. The combination is frequently used when resistance to either drug is suspected.

Objective

To review in vitro and clinical data regarding the activity of ganciclovir plus foscarnet and evidence of synergy between the two drugs.

Study Design

We reviewed two in vitro studies of synergy between ganciclovir and foscarnet followed by reviewing all clinical studies utilizing series of patients.

Results

The combination of ganciclovir and foscarnet was synergistic against three clinical isolates, the Towne strain and one laboratory derived strain moderately resistant to GCV but synergy was not demonstrated against laboratory derived strains highly resistant to GCV or foscarnet. AD169, susceptible to both drugs, was not inhibited synergistically by the combination in one study but was in the second study. In the only carefully controlled in vivo study of combination versus monotherapy for GCV susceptible viremia superiority of the combination was not demonstrated. In treating clinically resistant CMV retinitis, the combination was superior to continued or alternative monotherapy.

Conclusion

There is suggestive but inconclusive evidence of in vitro synergy for the combination of GCV and foscarnet versus CMV with very limited data versus GCV resistant virus. The in vivo data for synergy is even less convincing. Additional in vitro and in vivo data is needed, especially to prevent or treat CMV resistance.

### Management of cytomegalovirus infection in solid organ transplantation [^114xDXyA]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2010). Medium credibility.

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections are among the most common infections that occur following solid organ transplantation. CMV disease ranges from asymptomatic viremia, to CMV syndrome, to tissue-invasive disease. As CMV prophylaxis, treatment, diagnostics, and overall awareness have improved, the general trend has been towards earlier diagnosis of CMV disease and more mild clinical presentations in solid organ transplant recipients. Major stumbling blocks remain in the areas of duration of prophylaxis for the individual recipient, in the identification of which patients might need secondary prophylaxis, in the treatment of resistant virus, and in the possible use of the adoptive transfer of CMV-specific T cells. Several guidelines have been published during the past few years regarding the management of CMV in solid organ transplant recipients. This Review covers CMV diagnostics, methods for the prevention of CMV infection, treatment of both regular and drug-resistant CMV, as well as future directions for CMV management and research.

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) maribavir recommendations state that maribavir is recommended for the treatment of post-transplant resistant or refractory CMV infection or disease in adult and pediatric (12 years or older and weighing at least 35 kg) transplant recipients, and maribavir and (val)ganciclovir are antagonistic and should not be used in combination. Maribavir has poor central nervous system penetration and should not be used in cases of suspected or confirmed CMV retinitis or encephalitis, and acyclovir-based prophylaxis for herpes simplex virus and herpes zoster virus is recommended during maribavir treatment due to lack of in vitro activity of maribavir against these 2 viruses. We do not recommend maribavir as a first-line agent for preemptive therapy for HCT recipients who are able to receive (val)ganciclovir or foscarnet, although maribavir could be considered for preemptive therapy in patients who have developed or are at risk of developing toxic effects or intolerance to (val)ganciclovir or foscarnet such as renal impairment or myelosuppression. If maribavir is used as preemptive therapy for the treatment of CMV in patients with factors associated with suboptimal response, an infectious diseases consultation is advised. Genotypic testing is recommended when a refractory or resistant CMV infection is clinically suspected, and when a refractory or resistant CMV infection is clinically suspected, antiviral treatment should be modified while awaiting the testing results. A short course of combination therapy with foscarnet and maribavir followed by maribavir monotherapy could be considered (potentially enhance the reduction of high or persistent CMV viral loads) in some patients with complicated R/R CMV infections.

### The biology of cytomegalovirus drug resistance [^115eFeWC]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review assesses recently published data on cytomegalovirus (CMV) antiviral drug resistance.

Recent Findings

Resistance is typically encountered after prolonged ganciclovir treatment for posttransplant primary CMV infection and is diagnosed by the detection of characteristic mutations in the viral UL97 kinase and UL54 DNA polymerase genes in clinical specimens. One of seven canonical UL97 mutations is detected in most cases of ganciclovir resistance, but many viral sequence variants of unknown relevance are being reported after drug exposure in vitro and in vivo. Rapid technical advances in recombinant phenotyping have shown that many of these variants confer no detectable drug resistance, whereas some unusual resistance mutations are newly confirmed. All currently marketed CMV antiviral drugs, including foscarnet and cidofovir, target the viral DNA polymerase, and cross-resistance may result from some UL54 mutations. To decrease cross-resistance and toxicity, there is an ongoing effort to develop anti-CMV drugs with different resistance pathways and alternative targets, such as the UL97 kinase or UL56-UL89 terminase enzymes.

Summary

An increasing volume of information correlating CMV genotypes and drug susceptibility phenotypes is becoming available. This will improve the interpretation of sequence-based assays currently used for clinical diagnosis and guide the development of new antiviral drugs.

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections that are refractory or resistant (RR) to available antivirals ([val]ganciclovir, foscarnet, cidofovir) are associated with higher mortality in transplant patients. Maribavir is active against RR CMV strains.

Hematopoietic-cell or solid-organ transplant recipients ≥ 12 years old with RR CMV infections and plasma CMV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) ≥ 1000 copies/mL were randomized (1:1:1) to twice-daily dose-blinded maribavir 400, 800, or 1200 mg for up to 24 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients with confirmed undetectable plasma CMV DNA within 6 weeks of treatment. Safety analyses included the frequency and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs).

Results

From July 2012 to December 2014, 120 patients were randomized and treated (40 per dose group): 80/120 (67%) patients achieved undetectable CMV DNA within 6 weeks of treatment (95% confidence interval, 57–75%), with rates of 70%, 63%, and 68%, respectively, for maribavir 400, 800, and 1200 mg twice daily. Recurrent on-treatment CMV infections occurred in 25 patients; 13 developed mutations conferring maribavir resistance. Maribavir was discontinued due to adverse events in 41/120 (34%) patients, and 17/41 discontinued due to CMV infections. During the study, 32 (27%) patients died, 4 due to CMV disease. Dysgeusia was the most common TEAE (78/120; 65%) and led to maribavir discontinuation in 1 patient. Absolute neutrophil counts < 1000/µL were noted in 12/106 (11%) evaluable patients, with rates similar across doses.

Conclusions

Maribavir ≥ 400 mg twice daily was active against RR CMV infections in transplant recipients; no new safety signals were identified.

### Cytomegalovirus therapy: current constraints and future opportunities [^111pFNc5]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Articles published in the last year have changed perceptions of cytomegalovirus. It is now recognized as a rapidly replicating virus which develops resistance frequently during chronic administration of ganciclovir. In addition to causing end-organ diseases, it plays a causal role in the multifactorial processes leading to graft rejection after renal transplant and accelerated atherosclerosis after heart transplant. New treatments which are safe and potent are urgently needed and should be highly cost-effective when the full clinical impact of this virus is assessed.

RESULTS

Between 17 July 2012 and 5 December 2014, 129 patients consented and were screened, and 120 (47 HCT and 73 SOT recipients) were randomized (Figure 1). Baseline characteristics were similar between groups (Table 1, Supplementary Table S2). Despite not meeting 1 or more eligibility criteria, 14 patients were randomized into the study: 6 patients had screening CMV DNA < 1000 copies/mL; 2 patients weighed < 40 kg; 2 patients had current CMV infections not RR to available antivirals; 6 patients were receiving concomitant, prohibited anti-CMV therapies; and 1 patient required advanced life support at the time of enrollment. These patients were excluded from the PP population.

### Therapeutic strategies for cytomegalovirus infection in haematopoietic transplant recipients: a focused update [^116yRZSQ]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients, particularly following allogeneic haematopoietic transplantation. One of the principal factors leading to this increased risk is the loss of T-cell immunity.

Areas Covered

In a recent review, we assessed the treatment strategies for prophylaxis and pre-emptive treatment of CMV, particularly where relevant to the high-risk patient populations following allogeneic haematopoietic transplantation. This review is a focused update to our previous article and presents a more detailed analysis of the developments in drugs, vaccines and adoptive T-cell therapies since that time. Relevant studies were selected from PubMed and clinicaltrials.gov. The search terms include allogeneic transplant, cytomegalovirus, multidrug-resistant virus and adoptive T-cell therapy.

Expert Opinion

The current randomised controlled studies evaluating pharmacological agents for CMV should inform as to whether these provide significant clinical benefits. Adoptive cell therapy provides a more physiological approach to the problem of lack of CMV-specific immunity. Recent reports add to the evidence that culture-based techniques can create cellular products that are safe and efficacious, although without Phase III data to definitively support their routine application and the difficulty of satisfying GMP standards.

### The development and implementation of stewardship initiatives to optimize the prevention and treatment of cytomegalovirus infection in solid-organ transplant recipients [^11351wqQ]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Classical stewardship efforts have targeted immunocompetent patients; however, appropriate use of antimicrobials in the immunocompromised host has become a target of interest. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is one of the most common and significant complications after solid-organ transplant (SOT). The treatment of CMV requires a dual approach of antiviral drug therapy and reduction of immunosuppression for optimal outcomes. This dual approach to CMV management increases complexity and requires individualization of therapy to balance antiviral efficacy with the risk of allograft rejection. In this review, we focus on the development and implementation of CMV stewardship initiatives, as a component of antimicrobial stewardship in the immunocompromised host, to optimize the management of prevention and treatment of CMV in SOT recipients. These initiatives have the potential not only to improve judicious use of antivirals and prevent resistance but also to improve patient and graft survival given the interconnection between CMV infection and allograft function.

Objective

The article reviews the safety and efficacy of treatments for cytomegalovirus (CMV) in solid organ transplantation.

Data Sources

A literature review was conducted in PubMed, MEDLINE, and Clinicaltrials.gov from database inception through January 2024, using terms CMV, therapy, and solid organ transplantation.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Clinical trials, meta-analyses, cohort studies, case reports, and guidelines were included. Letters to the editor, reviews, and commentaries were excluded.

Data Synthesis

After abstract screening and full-text review of 728 citations for eligibility, 53 were included. Valganciclovir and intravenous ganciclovir are drugs of choice for CMV management and, until recently, the availability of alternative options has been restricted due to toxicity. For instance, foscarnet and cidofovir serve as second-line agents due to potential bone marrow and renal toxicity. In patients with refractory or resistant CMV, maribavir, a novel oral agent, has proven efficacy and a lower adverse effect profile. However, in refractory or resistant CMV, foscarnet and cidofovir are preferred in invasive disease (CMV gastritis, CMV retinitis, and CMV encephalitis), high viral loads, and inability to tolerate oral preparations.

Relevance To Patient Care and Clinical Practice

Consensus guidelines have not been revised since approval of novel antivirals in solid organ transplantation. Valganciclovir and ganciclovir remain drugs of choice for initial CMV therapy. Foscarnet, cidofovir, and maribavir are treatments for refractory or resistant-CMV.

Conclusions

Selection of CMV antiviral treatment should be determined by patient-specific factors, including severity of illness, resistant or refractory disease, dose-limiting adverse effects, and the preferred route of administration.

### Progress in understanding cytomegalovirus drug resistance [^113z8YJV]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2001). Low credibility.

The molecular basis for cytomegalovirus drug resistance against currently used antivirals comprises two genetic loci. In the case of ganciclovir, mutations in both the UL97 protein kinase and UL64 DNA polymerase can lead to resistance, whereas for cidofovir and foscarnet only mutations in UL54 give rise to resistance. Clinically, resistance strains of cytomegalovirus appear after prolonged periods of antiviral therapy especially when treatment has been interrupted or is at sub-optimal doses. Knowledge of the replication dynamics of cytomegalovirus in vivo can be used to predict the virologic course of patients who develop resistance virus. Using such models, a good agreement between experimentally determined viral load and resistance patterns is observed.

Background

The burden that cytomegalovirus (CMV) portends for haematopoietic and solid-organ transplant recipients cannot be understated. Valganciclovir and ganciclovir have successfully been used for prevention and treatment of CMV infections, although with serious side effects such as leucopenia and some development of resistance. Until recently, available therapies for ganciclovir-resistant CMV have significant toxicities. Although advances have been made in the field, the unmet medical needs for effective and well-tolerated therapies are significant.

Objectives

This review aims to summarise the current and emerging CMV antiviral drugs and discusses future perspectives in the field.

Sources

We searched for relevant articles with pertinent keywords: "Cytomegalovirus OR CMV", "Transplant" and "Antiviral". Articles published after 2019 were given preference. Articles were reviewed by the authors for relevance and impact to the subject of interest.

Content

We outline in this review current advances in prophylaxis of CMV infection with letermovir, breakthrough CMV infections while on or after prophylaxis, the development of resistant and refractory CMV infections, and the newly approved anti-CMV agent, maribavir, in haematopoietic and solid-organ transplant recipients.

Implications

Prevention of CMV infections after transplant has improved greatly over the past few years. Despite major advancements, breakthrough CMV infections and development of refractory and resistant CMV infections remain major complications post transplantation. We highlight emerging therapeutics that tolerably and effectively prevent and treat CMV infections, especially refractory and resistant cases.
