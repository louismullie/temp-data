## Question

what can cause hyperbilirubinemia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what can cause hyperbilirubinemia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the normal physiology of bilirubin handling and where it can be disrupted. Then, I should verify how to split the problem clinically into unconjugated versus conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Next, I will examine the principal causes within each category, including hemolysis, impaired conjugation, hepatocellular injury, and cholestasis. After that, I need to consider age-specific issues, especially in neonates, as well as inherited disorders and drug-induced mechanisms. Finally, I should confirm the diagnostic approach, including key labs and imaging, and remember a few pitfalls and special scenarios that can mislead us during evaluation.

> Let me first confirm the physiology anchor points so I don't jump to conclusions. Bilirubin is generated from heme breakdown, circulates as unconjugated bilirubin, is taken up by hepatocytes via OATP1B1/1B3 transporters, conjugated by UGT1A1, secreted into bile via MRP2, and a portion of conjugated bilirubin can reflux to blood and be re-uptaken by OATP1B1/1B3, creating a hepatocyte-blood shuttle; disruptions at production, uptake, conjugation, or excretion can raise serum bilirubin, and specific inherited defects map neatly to these steps, such as Gilbert and Crigler-Najjar for conjugation, Dubin-Johnson for canalicular export, and Rotor for uptake/reuptake of conjugated bilirubin [^1149keDS] [^1122jSpF] [^1149vNJC].

> Hold on, I should verify the first clinical fork in the road: fractionate the bilirubin. I need to check a direct (conjugated) and indirect (unconjugated) bilirubin, obtain a CBC, reticulocyte count, LDH, haptoglobin, AST/ALT, ALP, GGT, PT/INR, albumin, and urine bilirubin; urine bilirubin implies conjugated hyperbilirubinemia because unconjugated bilirubin is not filtered, and right-upper-quadrant ultrasound is the least invasive initial imaging to separate intrahepatic from extrahepatic cholestasis if the pattern is cholestatic; this split guides everything that follows [^113EquiN] [^116MrcMJ] [^117MpALN].

> Now, if the pattern is predominantly unconjugated, I need to think in three buckets: increased production (hemolysis or resorption of large hematomas), impaired conjugation (Gilbert syndrome, Crigler-Najjar, neonatal physiologic jaundice, breast milk jaundice), and decreased hepatic uptake or transporter/drug effects; labs suggesting hemolysis include anemia, elevated reticulocytes, high LDH, low haptoglobin, and a positive direct antiglobulin test, whereas a benign isolated indirect hyperbilirubinemia without hemolysis points toward Gilbert syndrome, which is common and often accentuated by fasting or intercurrent illness [^113EquiN] [^112XLmib] [^112qqg88].

> Wait, let me verify drug effects before labeling a case "benign". Antivirals and other agents can raise unconjugated bilirubin by inhibiting UGT1A1 and/or OATP1B1/1B3 without true hepatocellular injury, producing isolated indirect hyperbilirubinemia; the clinical significance is usually minimal if liver enzymes are stable, but brisk hemolysis or concomitant hepatotoxicity warrants dose adjustment or drug changes, so I should confirm the medication history and trajectory of AST/ALT alongside bilirubin fractions [^112yic8T] [^115LYB2Y].

> If the pattern is predominantly conjugated, I need to separate hepatocellular injury from cholestasis. Marked AST/ALT elevations favor hepatocellular processes such as viral hepatitis, alcohol-associated hepatitis, NASH, autoimmune hepatitis, ischemia, or drug-induced liver injury, whereas disproportionate ALP/GGT elevation suggests cholestasis; then, I should promptly perform RUQ ultrasound to distinguish extrahepatic obstruction (stones, malignancy, strictures) from intrahepatic cholestatic diseases such as PBC, PSC, sepsis-associated cholestasis, and drug-induced cholestasis [^117MpALN] [^113EquiN] [^112XLmib] [^111XyaWC].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially placed Rotor syndrome among mechanisms for unconjugated excess, but I should correct that. Rotor classically causes conjugated or mixed hyperbilirubinemia due to near-absent hepatic uptake of conjugated bilirubin from blood via OATP1B1/1B3, while Dubin-Johnson causes conjugated hyperbilirubinemia from impaired canalicular secretion via MRP2; recognizing these inherited patterns prevents unnecessary workup when liver enzymes are otherwise normal and the clinical course is benign [^116QGGbh] [^1149keDS] [^1122jSpF].

> Next, I should review age-specific issues, because neonates are different. Neonates commonly have unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia due to high bilirubin production and low UGT activity, but hemolysis, G6PD deficiency, ABO incompatibility, and other risk factors can drive rapid rises that require urgent evaluation and treatment; AAP 2022 guidance emphasizes measuring total serum bilirubin to guide phototherapy and exchange decisions, considering rate-of-rise to flag hemolysis, and checking conjugated bilirubin in prolonged jaundice to detect cholestasis such as biliary atresia, which mandates early recognition and surgical referral [^117DmQNe] [^114gTqHs] [^112Vxztf] [^115K5C5A].

> But wait, what if the prolonged neonatal jaundice is conjugated from the outset. I need to ensure I evaluate for neonatal cholestasis promptly, because extrahepatic biliary atresia and idiopathic neonatal hepatitis account for a large proportion of infant cholestasis, and infants with biliary atresia may already show elevated direct bilirubin within the first 48 hours; timely imaging, targeted labs, and expedited referral improve outcomes, so I should not dismiss a direct hyperbilirubinemia as physiologic in this age group [^116pqVEJ] [^115QhRTS] [^115SQBtF].

> I will now examine drug-induced bilirubin elevations that can masquerade as liver injury. Some agents raise bilirubin primarily through transporter or UGT1A1 inhibition without hepatocellular damage, exemplified by protease inhibitors like atazanavir where OATP1B1/1B3 effects may be as or more important than UGT1A1 inhibition; mechanistic and systems pharmacology models, and clinical data from new compounds such as BAY1128688, show bilirubin can rise independently of ALT, so I should confirm whether the bilirubin pattern and enzymes indicate a benign interaction versus true DILI before altering therapy [^115LYB2Y] [^111MNhHv] [^116MiUTa] [^1149vNJC].

> Hold on, I should verify a few pitfalls to avoid misclassification. Spurious total bilirubin elevations can occur from assay interference in paraproteinemia, and high bilirubin can cause false-positive acetaminophen levels with some colorimetric assays, so if the clinical picture does not fit, I need to double-check with alternative methods and discuss with the laboratory; similarly, in suspected Gilbert syndrome, a fasting sample often accentuates the indirect fraction, but I must exclude hemolysis with the proper hemolysis panel before settling on a benign diagnosis [^112cn9Cy] [^1176bv4e] [^112XLmib].

> To synthesize, I should confirm whether hyperbilirubinemia is unconjugated or conjugated, then map causes accordingly: prehepatic overproduction such as hemolysis increases unconjugated bilirubin, intrahepatic processes may yield either pattern depending on the step disrupted, and posthepatic obstruction typically raises conjugated bilirubin; careful history, directed labs including fractionated bilirubin and hemolysis studies, and early ultrasound when cholestasis is suspected provide a reliable, stepwise way to navigate the differential [^116MrcMJ] [^113EquiN] [^117MpALN].

Hyperbilirubinemia arises from **increased bilirubin production** (hemolysis, hematoma resorption) [^113EquiN], **impaired hepatic conjugation** (Gilbert, Crigler-Najjar, neonatal immaturity) [^1149keDS], or **reduced excretion** (hepatocellular injury, cholestasis, biliary obstruction) [^117MpALN]. Drug-induced causes include **enzyme/transporter inhibition** (e.g. atazanavir, indinavir) [^112yic8T] [^115LYB2Y] or **hepatotoxicity** [^116MiUTa]. Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia is common and often **physiologic** [^1174Vr6V] [^114FLtHg], but can be severe with **hemolysis**, **G6PD deficiency**, or **biliary atresia** [^112AkS7C] [^115K5C5A]. Evaluation should include fractionated bilirubin [^112XLmib], liver enzymes [^113EquiN], hemolysis markers, and imaging to distinguish unconjugated from conjugated causes and guide management [^111XyaWC].

---

## Increased bilirubin production (pre-hepatic causes)

Pre-hepatic causes include **hemolytic anemias** (sickle cell disease, hereditary spherocytosis, G6PD deficiency, autoimmune hemolytic anemia) [^113EquiN] [^116MrcMJ] and **hematoma resorption**, where large hematomas or internal bleeding increase the bilirubin load [^113EquiN].

---

## Impaired hepatic conjugation (hepatic causes)

- **Genetic disorders**: Gilbert syndrome (mild UGT1A1 deficiency), Crigler-Najjar syndrome (severe UGT1A1 deficiency) [^1149keDS] [^1163DvT3].
- **Neonatal immaturity**: Physiologic jaundice from low UGT1A1 activity [^114FLtHg] [^1174Vr6V].
- **Liver diseases**: Hepatitis, cirrhosis, alcoholic liver disease impair conjugation [^113EquiN] [^117MpALN].

---

## Reduced bilirubin excretion (post-hepatic causes)

Post-hepatic causes include **biliary obstruction** (gallstones, strictures, tumors, pancreatitis) [^111XyaWC] and **cholestatic disorders** such as primary biliary cholangitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, and drug-induced cholestasis [^117MpALN] [^113zdzMx].

---

## Drug-induced hyperbilirubinemia

Drug-induced hyperbilirubinemia arises from **enzyme/transporter inhibition** (atazanavir, indinavir, rifampin, probenecid) [^115LYB2Y] [^112yic8T] [^1149vNJC] or **hepatotoxicity** due to agents such as acetaminophen overdose, isoniazid, and valproic acid [^116MiUTa] [^112yic8T].

---

## Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia

Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia includes **physiologic jaundice**, which is common and usually benign [^1174Vr6V] [^114FLtHg], and **pathologic causes** such as hemolysis, G6PD deficiency, biliary atresia, and infections [^112AkS7C] [^115K5C5A] [^117DmQNe].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Diagnostic evaluation includes **laboratory tests** — fractionated bilirubin, liver enzymes, and hemolysis markers [^112XLmib] [^113EquiN] — and **imaging** (ultrasound, CT, or MRI) to assess obstruction or liver disease [^111XyaWC] [^117MpALN].

---

Hyperbilirubinemia results from **increased production**, **impaired conjugation**, or **reduced excretion** of bilirubin, with causes including hemolysis, genetic disorders, liver disease, biliary obstruction, and drugs; neonatal cases are often physiologic but can be severe [^113EquiN].

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^112XLmib]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

There are three common patterns of abnormal liver test results whose recognition can aid diagnosis:

- **Isolated raised bilirubin**: This is most commonly caused by Gilbert's syndrome, which affects 5–8% of the population. In patients with anemia, consider hemolysis. Repeat liver blood tests on a fasting sample, including a full blood count and direct and indirect bilirubin. The total bilirubin should rise further due to the indirect component, and there should be no evidence of anemia. If the patient is anemic, hemolysis needs to be excluded by requesting a reticulocyte count, lactate dehydrogenase, and haptoglobin. If the unconjugated bilirubin is more markedly elevated (> 40 μmol/L), rarer causes such as Crigler-Najjar syndrome should be considered, and genetic testing should be undertaken.

- **Cholestatic**: Predominantly raised ALP and GGT indicate cholestasis. Common causes include primary biliary cholangitis, PSC, biliary obstruction (stones, strictures, neoplasia, etc), hepatic congestion, and drug-induced liver injury. In children, additional disorders that may present with cholestasis include biliary tract abnormalities and genetic disorders of bile synthesis and excretion. However, an isolated raised ALP may be caused by vitamin D deficiency and not be liver-related, or it may relate to raised values during periods of rapid growth in childhood. Thus, the presence of a concomitantly elevated GGT can help confirm the cause of liver disease. In children with specific inherited disorders of bile acid synthesis and transport, GGT is characteristically not elevated.

### Evaluation of jaundice in adults [^113EquiN]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Jaundice in adults can indicate a significant underlying disease as it is caused by elevated serum bilirubin levels, either in the unconjugated or conjugated form. The evaluation of jaundice primarily relies on a detailed history and physical examination.

- **Initial laboratory evaluation**: Should include fractionated bilirubin, a complete blood count, alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, γ-glutamyltransferase, prothrombin time and/or international normalized ratio, albumin, and protein.

- **Imaging**: Ultrasonography or computed tomography can differentiate between extrahepatic obstructive and intrahepatic parenchymal disorders. Ultrasonography is the least invasive and least expensive imaging method available. A more extensive evaluation may involve additional cancer screening, biliary imaging, autoimmune antibody assays, and liver biopsy.

Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia occurs with increased bilirubin production due to red blood cell destruction, as seen in hemolytic disorders, and disorders of impaired bilirubin conjugation, such as Gilbert syndrome. Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia is observed in disorders involving hepatocellular damage, such as viral and alcoholic hepatitis, and cholestatic disorders, including choledocholithiasis and neoplastic obstruction of the biliary tree.

### Neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia: A global perspective [^114FLtHg]. The Lancet Child & Adolescent Health (2018). Low credibility.

Hyperbilirubinaemia, presenting as jaundice, is a ubiquitous and frequently benign condition in newborn babies but is a leading cause of hospitalisation in the first week of life. In some infants, jaundice can become severe, progressing to acute bilirubin encephalopathy and kernicterus, with a substantial risk of neonatal mortality and long-term neurodevelopmental impairments. Severe hyperbilirubinaemia and its sequelae continue to occur in industrialised countries with functioning medical systems, and a disproportionately high burden also persists in low-income and middle-income countries, due primarily to delays in delivering effective treatments that are routinely available in high-income countries.

In this review, we summarise up-to-date evidence on the epidemiology of neonatal jaundice, including its global burden based on estimates of its prevalence, and both fatal and non-fatal health outcomes. We also discuss the management of severe hyperbilirubinaemia, including prevention of kernicterus, and highlight future directions for research.

### Inhibition of OATP1B1/3 rather than UGT1A1 may be the major cause of the bilirubin elevation after atazanavir administration [^1149vNJC]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Low credibility.

Total serum bilirubin mostly consists of unconjugated bilirubin, with less than 5% present as conjugated bilirubin in healthy subjects. Unconjugated bilirubin is metabolized solely by UGT1A1 to conjugated bilirubin after hepatic uptake by OATP1B1/3 (Figure 1a). Conjugated bilirubin is a mixture of bilirubin mono‐ (15%) and di‐glucuronide (85%) and is primarily eliminated by biliary excretion mediated by MRP2. It is also a substrate of OATP1B1/3 as well as MRP3.

OATP1B1/3 in downstream hepatocytes may re‐uptake conjugated bilirubin refluxed by MRP3 to serum back to hepatocytes. Total bilirubin level may be altered by drugs that inhibit UGT1A1 and/or OATP1B1/3, as well as polymorphism of UGT1A1, OATP1B1/3, and MRP2. Individuals with decreased activities in these enzymes/transporters may have Gilbert's syndrome (decreased UGT1A1 activity), Rotor syndrome (simultaneous absence of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3), or Dubin‐Johnson syndrome (absence or deficiency of MRP2).

### Inherited disorders of bilirubin transport and conjugation: New insights into molecular mechanisms and consequences [^1149keDS]. Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Inherited disorders of bilirubin metabolism might reduce bilirubin uptake by hepatocytes, bilirubin conjugation, or secretion of bilirubin into bile. Reductions in uptake could increase levels of unconjugated or conjugated bilirubin, as seen in Rotor syndrome. Defects in bilirubin conjugation could increase levels of unconjugated bilirubin; the effects can be benign and frequent, such as in Gilbert syndrome, or rare but severe, increasing the risk of bilirubin encephalopathy, as observed in Crigler-Najjar syndrome. Impairment of bilirubin secretion leads to accumulation of conjugated bilirubin, exemplified by Dubin-Johnson syndrome.

This paper reviews the genetic causes and pathophysiology of disorders of bilirubin transport and conjugation, alongside clinical and therapeutic aspects. Additionally, it discusses possible mechanisms by which hyperbilirubinemia could protect against cardiovascular disease and the metabolic syndrome, as well as the effects of specific genetic variants on drug metabolism and cancer development.

### Hyperbilirubinemia in the setting of antiviral therapy [^112yic8T]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2005). Low credibility.

Hyperbilirubinemia is a common side effect of antiviral medications. The mechanisms underlying its development are multiple and unique to each therapy. During the administration of antiviral medications, the hyperbilirubinemia observed in the absence of liver injury is most frequently manifested by isolated increases in the indirect-reacting fraction. Relevant mechanisms leading to indirect hyperbilirubinemia in this setting include hemolysis and decreased hepatic bilirubin clearance as a result of impairment of bilirubin conjugation, or circumstances in which both processes occur simultaneously. Underlying genetic susceptibilities may potentiate these side effects of antiviral therapy.

Conjugated (direct-reacting) hyperbilirubinemia can be a consequence of generalized hepatocellular injury, selective cholestatic defects, biliary obstruction, or, rarely, genetic disorders of bilirubin transport. In the specific setting of antiviral therapy, preexisting liver disease or antiviral hepatotoxicity, such as encountered with the use of nucleoside and non-nucleoside human immunodeficiency virus reverse transcriptase inhibitors, are the most frequent causes of direct-reacting or mixed direct- and indirect-reacting hyperbilirubinemia.

Modification in antiviral drug choice or dose may be required in cases of liver injury or brisk hemolysis leading to significant anemia. The mild indirect hyperbilirubinemia associated with impairment in conjugation tends to be well tolerated and of little consequence. The decision to continue or discontinue antiviral therapy in the face of hyperbilirubinemia requires careful consideration of the patient's overall clinical condition.

### Ugt1a1 mutation association with increased bilirubin levels and severity of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia in ABO incompatible newborns of China [^112AkS7C]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Low credibility.

Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia causing jaundice is a complex pediatric disorder affecting up to 80% of newborns worldwide. Although it is benign in the vast majority of infants, total serum bilirubin (TSB) may accumulate and reach very high levels in some cases. Once it reaches the hazardous threshold levels, certain brain regions can be irreversibly damaged.

In 2004, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines listed East Asia, including mainland China, as a major risk factor for severe hyperbilirubinemia. The incidence and severity of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia in Asians and American Indians are much higher compared to those in Caucasian and Black populations. It has been suggested that the high incidence rate of hemolytic anemia, caused by ABO alloimmunization or glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, may predispose these populations to neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. The overall risk dramatically increases for a TSB level of 20 mg/dL (342 mmol/L).

Congenital variation of the bilirubin clearance rate in the liver is also the biological basis of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia risk in Asia. The key bilirubin metabolism gene, namely, the hepatic bilirubin conjugating isoenzyme UDP glucuronosyltransferase family 1 member A1 (UGT1A1), was classically described for Crigler-Najjar type I and II syndromes as well as Gilbert syndrome. More and more evidence has shown that the genetic variation of UGT1A1 is also closely related to the incidence rate and severity of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. However, the innate variants of the UGT1A1 gene are undetected in certain scenarios.

### Association between elevated serum bilirubin levels with preserved lung function under conditions of exposure to air pollution [^117GF75F]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

High serum bilirubin levels have been shown to be associated with improved pulmonary function test results. Their potential ability to similarly benefit pulmonary function in an environment of polluted air has not been tested. We retrospectively analyzed data of 15,605 apparently healthy individuals in order to evaluate the effect of serum bilirubin levels on forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1).

- **Methods**: Individuals attended the Tel-Aviv Medical Center Inflammatory Survey for a routine annual health check between February 2002 and June 2009 and were divided into low, medium, and high serum bilirubin levels. Their FEV1 results were compared under various levels of air pollution. Air pollution and weather data were obtained from air pollution monitoring stations of the Israeli Ministry of Environmental Protection.

- **Results**: The elevated serum bilirubin concentrations on FEV1 were evaluated under moderate and high pollution levels. FEV1 was significantly higher in participants with high blood bilirubin levels compared to medium or low levels (p < 0.001 and p = 0.018, respectively). Participants with high levels of bilirubin had preserved FEV1 under exposure to high and medium pollution levels of both Nitrogen Oxide (NOx) and Carbon Monoxide (CO) pollutants (p = 0.003 and p = 0.022, respectively). The multivariate regression analysis revealed that the influence of bilirubin under conditions of air pollution remained significant even after adjustment for FEV1 confounders, but the interaction was not significant.

- **Conclusions**: Elevated serum bilirubin concentrations may have protective effects on lung function in environments with significant air pollution exposure, although further studies are needed to confirm these findings.

### Bilirubin decreases macrophage cholesterol efflux and ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 protein expression [^115jnr8z]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Mild but chronically elevated circulating unconjugated bilirubin is associated with reduced total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations, which correlate with reduced cardiovascular disease risk. We aimed to investigate whether unconjugated bilirubin influences macrophage cholesterol efflux as a potential mechanism for the altered circulating lipoprotein concentrations observed in hyperbilirubinemic individuals.

- **Methods and results**: Cholesterol efflux from THP-1 macrophages was assessed using plasma obtained from normo- and hyperbilirubinemic (Gilbert syndrome) humans (n = 60 per group) or (heterozygote/homozygote Gunn) rats (n = 20 per group) as an acceptor. Hyperbilirubinemic plasma from patients with Gilbert syndrome and Gunn rats induced significantly reduced cholesterol efflux compared to normobilirubinemic plasma. Unconjugated bilirubin (3–17.1 μmol/L) exogenously added to plasma- or apolipoprotein A1-supplemented media also decreased macrophage cholesterol efflux in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. We also showed reduced protein expression of the ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1), a transmembrane cholesterol transporter involved in apolipoprotein A1-mediated cholesterol efflux, in THP-1 macrophages treated with unconjugated bilirubin and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from hyperbilirubinemic individuals. Furthermore, we demonstrated that bilirubin accelerates the degradation rate of the ABCA1 protein in THP-1 macrophages.

### Targeting inflammation to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular risk in people with HIV infection [^113567yG]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

Bilirubin has been shown to have antiatherogenic characteristics attributed, in part, to its antioxidant properties. Individuals with Gilbert syndrome, who have a hereditary inability to conjugate bilirubin and elevated levels of unconjugated bilirubin as a result, have lower rates of stroke, coronary artery disease, and other inflammatory conditions. This property has been studied as a possible intervention to reduce the risk of CVD for HIV‐negative individuals with diabetes mellitus. Through the use of pharmacological interventions, which increase serum bilirubin levels, several studies have shown a decrease in CVD with elevated bilirubin levels in patients with diabetes mellitus. More recently, analyses of 96,381 participants in the Veterans Aging Cohort Study, one‐third of whom were HIV positive, showed that an elevated bilirubin level is inversely correlated with CVD among both HIV‐positive and ‐negative individuals. Bilirubin elevations are common during treatment with the protease inhibitor, atazanavir. In a prospective RCT on CIMT, elevated bilirubin in study participants receiving atazanavir appeared to favorably influence CIMT progression rates. These findings raise the interesting prospect of harnessing the protective effect of elevated bilirubin to reduce cardiovascular risk in PLWH.

### Assessment of UGT polymorphisms and neonatal jaundice [^112qqg88]. Seminars in Perinatology (2011). Low credibility.

Elevation of the serum bilirubin level is a common, if not universal, finding during the first week of life. This can be a transient phenomenon that resolves spontaneously, or it can signify a serious or even life-threatening condition. There are many causes of hyperbilirubinemia and related therapeutic and prognostic implications.

- **Clinical presentation, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment**: The diseases in which there is a primary disorder of the metabolism of bilirubin will be reviewed regarding these aspects. Disorders such as Gilbert's syndrome and Crigler-Najjar syndrome involve abnormalities in bilirubin conjugation secondary to a deficiency of bilirubin uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase.

- **Genetic polymorphisms**: The purpose of this article is to review the understanding of the genetic polymorphisms that result in these diseases and discuss recent advances in diagnosis and treatment.

### Clinical practice guideline revision: Management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation [^117DmQNe]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, particularly with respect to bilirubin measurement, the AAP 2022 guidelines recommend measuring total serum bilirubin as the definitive test to guide phototherapy and escalation-of-care decisions, including exchange transfusion.

### Evaluation of abnormal liver tests in the adult asymptomatic patient [^112Rymzo]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Liver blood tests, including bilirubin, aminotransferases, and alkaline phosphatase, are among the most commonly encountered tests in medicine. These tests serve multiple purposes, such as investigating symptoms, monitoring medication, assessing chronic disease, and conducting routine assessments, resulting in abnormalities in up to 40% of patients.

The toll of liver disease continues to rise, and abnormal liver tests offer an opportunity to identify hepatic disease early, when treatment is most effective and before patients suffer the potential downstream consequences of cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and hepatocellular carcinoma. By utilizing diagnostic strategies, including detailed history gathering, assessment of alcohol use, recognition of metabolic syndrome, and identifying patterns of liver test abnormalities, clinicians can develop a systematic approach to address these abnormalities. For these reasons, developing an evidence-based, systematic approach to handling abnormal liver tests is critically important.

This review seeks to synthesize key elements of the best evidence, currently available guidelines, and expert opinion in drafting a strategy to aid clinicians and patients in the timely and accurate diagnosis of liver disease for adult asymptomatic patients with abnormal liver tests.

### Systemic regulation of bilirubin homeostasis: Potential benefits of hyperbilirubinemia [^117NYfqK]. Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

Neurotoxic bilirubin is the end product of heme catabolism in mammals. It is solely conjugated by uridine diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1, a membrane-bound enzyme catalyzing the transfer of glucuronic acid. Due to low function of hepatic and intestinal uridine diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 during the neonatal period, human neonates develop mild to severe physiological hyperbilirubinemia. Accumulation of bilirubin in the brain leads to irreversible brain damage known as kernicterus. Breastfeeding significantly increases the risk of developing kernicterus in infants. Why does this most natural way of feeding increase the risk of brain damage or even death?

This question leads to the hypothesis that breast milk-induced hyperbilirubinemia might offer benefits that outweigh those risks. While bilirubin is both neurotoxic and cytotoxic, it is also a potent antioxidant. Studies have shown improved clinical conditions in patients with hyperbilirubinemia. Accumulating evidence also suggests that genetic polymorphisms linked to hyperbilirubinemia are beneficial against various diseases.

In this review article, we first introduce the production, metabolism, and transport of bilirubin. We then discuss the potential benefits of neonatal and adult hyperbilirubinemia. Finally, we describe the epigenetic factors and metabolomic information associated with hyperbilirubinemia. This review advances the understanding of the physiological importance of the paradoxical compound, bilirubin.

### Jaundice and breastfeeding [^112rHZGL]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Optimal management of breastfeeding does not eliminate neonatal jaundice and elevated serum bilirubin concentrations; rather, it leads to a pattern of hyperbilirubinemia that is normal and, possibly, beneficial to infants. An excessive frequency of exaggerated jaundice in a hospital or community population of breastfed infants may be a warning that breastfeeding policies and support are not ideal for establishing good breastfeeding practices. The challenge to clinicians is to differentiate normal patterns of jaundice and hyperbilirubinemia from those that indicate an abnormality or place an infant at risk.

### Etiologies of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia in infancy: a systematic review of 1692 subjects [^11134N7L]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Infantile conjugated hyperbilirubinemia presents with persistent jaundice as part of a clinical constellation that may include other symptoms based on the underlying etiology. The differential diagnosis is broad and requires timely evaluation. The data presented in this review suggest that INH, EHBA, and infection (with CMV being the most common infection) account for 63.36% of all cases of infants presenting with elevated serum concentrations of conjugated bilirubin.

The diagnostic evaluation should be guided by symptomatology and may include various imaging studies, as well as serologic, hematologic, and urine investigations for various infections and endocrinopathies, along with genetic testing for inborn errors of metabolism. While the definitive diagnosis of EHBA requires a percutaneous liver biopsy, ongoing research is investigating less invasive methods of differentiating EHBA from other etiologies of infantile conjugated hyperbilirubinemia.

Inconsistency of the diagnostic approach is a major limitation of this review. While there are general guidelines directing the evaluation of an infant with conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, reports published prior to the establishment of these guidelines are included in the present review. Moreover, diagnostic practices vary by country, and multiple studies focused on the ability of a specific radiologic test to differentiate EHBA from other causes of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Together, these conditions may introduce inherent disparities in evaluation and may contribute to bias among these studies.

### Hereditary conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia: 37 years later [^116QGGbh]. Journal of Hepatology (2013). Low credibility.

Bilirubin, a breakdown product of heme, is normally glucuronidated and excreted by the liver into bile. Failure of this system can lead to a buildup of conjugated bilirubin in the blood, resulting in jaundice. The mechanistic basis of bilirubin excretion and hyperbilirubinemia syndromes is largely understood. However, the mechanism of Rotor syndrome, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, coproporphyrinuria, and near-absent hepatic uptake of anionic diagnostics, has remained enigmatic.

We analyzed eight Rotor syndrome families and found that Rotor syndrome was linked to mutations predicted to cause complete and simultaneous deficiencies of the organic anion transporting polypeptides OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. These important detoxification-limiting proteins mediate the uptake and clearance of countless drugs and drug conjugates across the sinusoidal hepatocyte membrane. OATP1B1 polymorphisms have previously been linked to drug hypersensitivities.

Using mice deficient in Oatp1a/1b and in the multispecific sinusoidal export pump Abcc3, we found that Abcc3 secretes bilirubin conjugates into the blood, while Oatp1a/1b transporters mediate their hepatic reuptake. Transgenic expression of human OATP1B1 or OATP1B3 restored the function of this detoxification-enhancing liver-blood shuttle in Oatp1a/1b-deficient mice. Within liver lobules, this shuttle may allow flexible transfer of bilirubin conjugates (and probably also drug conjugates) formed in upstream hepatocytes to downstream hepatocytes, thereby preventing local saturation of further detoxification processes.

### Management of late-preterm and term infants with hyperbilirubinaemia in resource-constrained settings [^111aub4d]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

While we set out to ensure that our recommendations are realistic and consistent with the prevailing conditions in most LMICs, the methodological approach used in this document deserves clarification. We followed standard protocols for guideline adaptation, including a comprehensive review of the priority issues to be considered, the formation of a working group, quality rating of existing guidelines, and independent review by a panel of leading clinicians and experts on newborn care from different world regions. However, we did not grade specific studies in support of various proposals in this paper, primarily because the body of evidence was predominantly adapted from existing guidelines or supported by the best available data from LMICs.

Neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia is frequently underpinned by complex interactions of diverse biological and environmental risk factors across populations. It is our view, therefore, that each LMIC still needs to develop context-specific guidelines for their own population. Such an initiative should be broadened to involve key stakeholders, including parent groups and community leaders. It may be helpful to prepare separate documents for each level of care to avoid information overload, especially at the primary care level.

While the scope of this framework is not exhaustive, like any of the existing guidelines, we believe that most of the recommendations will still be valuable to LMICs that did not meet our selection criteria. Finally, strong clinical and public health leadership at all levels will be required to surmount the challenges faced in implementing these recommendations.

### Clinical approach to patients with obstructive jaundice [^111XyaWC]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Obstructive jaundice is a clinical symptom that results from cholestasis. Cholestasis can be extrahepatic or intrahepatic and is typically associated with biochemical abnormalities in liver function tests. Once these abnormalities are identified, more extensive imaging tests can be performed to determine the nature, etiology, and level of obstruction. This information is essential for clinicians as they decide on management and treatment strategies.

### Management of severe hyperbilirubinemia in the cholestatic neonate: A review and an approach [^111wAmpe]. Journal of Perinatology (2022). Low credibility.

A review of the literature demonstrates that severe total hyperbilirubinemia (total serum bilirubin ≥ 20 mg/dL [340 µmol/L]) in some cholestatic term (≥ 37 weeks) and late-preterm (≥ 34 0/7 6/7 weeks) gestation neonates poses a risk for bilirubin-induced brain damage. When the direct bilirubin fraction is < 50% of the total serum bilirubin, this risk is associated with the total serum bilirubin alone, and treatment decisions should be based on the total serum bilirubin. On the other hand, there are limited data on the risk of bilirubin-induced brain damage in the neonate with severe total hyperbilirubinemia and a direct bilirubin fraction that is equal to or exceeds 50% of the total serum bilirubin. When this rare combination occurs, efforts to keep the indirect bilirubin fraction from reaching severe levels might, nevertheless, be prudent.

### Association of plasma bilirubin with coronary heart disease and segregation of bilirubin as a major gene trait: the NHLBI family heart study [^1179qooc]. Atherosclerosis (2001). Low credibility.

Decreased serum bilirubin levels have been associated with coronary heart disease (CHD). It is believed that bilirubin acts as an antioxidant, preventing the formation of oxidized LDL and subsequent atherosclerosis. Serum bilirubin also segregates as a major gene, with the rarer genotype associated with elevated bilirubin levels and occurring in about 12% of the population. Using a large population-based study of random and CHD high-risk families, this analysis was designed to replicate the association of lower serum bilirubin levels with early CHD (onset by age 55 for males and 65 for females) using 328 case/control samples and the major gene segregation of bilirubin levels in 555 families.

There were significant differences in plasma bilirubin levels between 188 males (12.5 micromol/l) and 140 females (9.3 micromol/l, P < 0.0001). Higher serum albumin and lower HDL-C significantly correlated with higher plasma bilirubin levels in females but not males.

- **Logistic regression analysis**: In sex-specific logistic regression models of early CHD (148 cases and 180 controls), lower plasma bilirubin was associated with increased prevalence of CHD in males with borderline significance (odds ratio = 0.93 for a 1 micromol/l increase in bilirubin, P = 0.056) but not in females.

- **Bilirubin segregation as a major gene**: Bilirubin was found to segregate as a major gene using all 555 families consisting of 1,292 individuals, with estimates replicating those in the previously published study. The most parsimonious model was a recessive model for high bilirubin levels that occurred in about 23% of the population. The means were separated by 1.7 standard deviations.

### Clinical practice guideline revision: Management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation [^112Vxztf]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, specifically concerning bilirubin measurement, the AAP 2022 guidelines recommend measuring total and conjugated (direct) serum bilirubin concentrations. This is to identify possible pathologic cholestasis in breastfed infants who remain jaundiced at 3–4 weeks of age and formula-fed infants who remain jaundiced at 2 weeks of age.

### Genome-wide analyses of neonatal jaundice reveal a marked departure from adult bilirubin metabolism [^1174Vr6V]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Most neonates are affected by jaundice in their first days of life, caused by the accumulation of bilirubin (hyperbilirubinemia). While this condition occurs to some degree in 50–90% of births, it usually resolves without treatment. Phototherapy is employed in more serious cases, around 5–10% of newborns, and can be effective. Yet, severe cases of jaundice still occur, leading to neurotoxicity, long-term cognitive impairment, and, in rare instances, kernicterus and death, causing a significant burden on global health.

Many questions about the etiology of neonatal jaundice remain, although the core biochemistry of bilirubin metabolism is known. Unconjugated bilirubin is produced in the breakdown of hemoglobin, then taken up into hepatocytes and converted to conjugated bilirubin by uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT). Conjugated bilirubin is transported to bile, while hopping in and out of hepatocytes to prevent local accumulation, and subsequently travels to the intestines for excretion via feces. In neonates, liver UGT expression is low, whereas the production of unconjugated bilirubin is high due to the faster turnover of red blood cells and fetal hemoglobin, leading to its accumulation. It is likely that neonates also differ in the activity of other enzymes, such as those involved in uptake into the liver, transporters, and excretion mechanisms, contributing to the bilirubin imbalance, but these factors have only begun to be explored.

It is not clear why, in some newborns, this imbalance is more severe, with worse clinical presentation. Bilirubin accumulation is more pronounced in preterm newborns.

### Etiologies of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia in infancy: A systematic review of 1692 subjects [^115SQBtF]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Results from all of the studies were pooled to provide rate estimates of categorical and specific etiologies of cholestasis. Rate estimates for etiologic categories were calculated from the total number of subjects used in the entire review. Rate estimates for specific infectious and metabolic etiologies employed the total number of subjects reported with specific infectious and metabolic disorders as the denominator.

- **Sources of bias across studies**: Variability in diagnostic evaluations and the potential for overestimation of idiopathic neonatal hepatitis (INH) represent possible sources of bias. The identification of multiple etiologies in individual patients, as well as inconsistencies and vagaries in nomenclature, were potential sources of error when studies were combined. In some cases, delayed clinical presentation may have affected diagnostic accuracy.

### Does elevated peak bilirubin protect from retinopathy of prematurity in very low birthweight infants [^113w2tLK]. Journal of Perinatology (2003). Low credibility.

Bilirubin is a potent in vitro antioxidant. Despite repeated studies, its in vivo significance has yet to be defined. Bilirubin is universally elevated in very low birthweight (VLBW) infants. Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a disease thought to be associated with exposure to oxygen free radicals in VLBW infants. The objective of this study was to determine whether there was an association between peak bilirubin levels and ROP.

- **Methods**: The risk for ROP, stages III and IV, was measured as a function of increasing peak bilirubin levels in VLBW infants admitted to the neonatal ICU. A similar analysis was performed on a subgroup of VLBW infants with prolonged (≥ 28 days) oxygen requirement. The relation between peak bilirubin level and the duration of oxygen requirement was tested by logistic regression analysis. All analyses were conducted after controlling for birthweight and presence of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH).

- **Results**: There was an increased risk for ROP, stages III and IV (OR 1.187; 95% CI 1.013 to 1.390; p = 0.034), with elevated peak serum bilirubin levels in the entire population. Duration of oxygen requirement was not related to peak bilirubin (p > 0.1). In the subgroup of infants with prolonged oxygen requirement (≥ 28 days), there was no association between peak serum bilirubin levels and ROP III and IV (p > 0.1); however, there was an association with further increased duration of oxygen requirement (p = 0.034).

Elevated peak bilirubin does not protect from and may be a risk for ROP in VLBW infants.

### Extreme neonatal hyperbilirubinemia and a specific genotype: a population-based case-control study [^1162cbhN]. Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Extreme hyperbilirubinemia (plasma bilirubin ≥ 24.5 mg/dL) is an important risk factor for severe bilirubin encephalopathy. Several risk factors for hyperbilirubinemia are known, but in a large number of patients, a causal factor is never established. UGT1A1 is the rate-limiting enzyme in bilirubin's metabolism. The genotype of Gilbert syndrome, the UGT1A1*28 allele, causes markedly reduced activity of this enzyme, but its association with neonatal hyperbilirubinemia is uncertain, and its relationship with extreme hyperbilirubinemia has not been studied. We examined whether the UGT1A1*28 allele is associated with extreme hyperbilirubinemia.

- **Methods**: The UGT1A1*28 allele was assessed in a case-control study of 231 white infants who had extreme hyperbilirubinemia in Denmark from 2000 to 2007 and 432 white controls. Cases were identified in the Danish Extreme Hyperbilirubinemia Database that covers the entire population. Genotypes were obtained through the Danish Neonatal Screening Biobank. Subgroup analysis was done for AB0 incompatible cases.

- **Results**: No association was found between the UGT1A1*28 allele and extreme hyperbilirubinemia. With the common genotype as reference, the odds ratio of extreme hyperbilirubinemia was 0.87 (range, 0.68–1.13) for UGT1A1*28 heterozygotes and 0.77 (range, 0.46–1.27) for homozygotes. Also, no association was found for AB0 incompatible cases.

- **Conclusions**: The UGT1A1*28 allele was not associated with risk for extreme hyperbilirubinemia in this study.

### Association between elevated serum bilirubin levels with preserved lung function under conditions of exposure to air pollution [^116ttUoz]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

High serum bilirubin levels have been shown to be associated with improved pulmonary function test results. Their potential ability to similarly benefit pulmonary function in an environment of polluted air has not been tested. We retrospectively analyzed data of 15,605 apparently healthy individuals to evaluate the effect of serum bilirubin levels on forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1).

- **Methods**: Individuals attended the Tel-Aviv Medical Center Inflammatory Survey for a routine annual health check between February 2002 and June 2009 and were divided into low, medium, and high serum bilirubin levels. Their FEV1 results were compared under various levels of air pollution. Air pollution and weather data were obtained from air pollution monitoring stations of the Israeli Ministry of Environmental Protection.

- **Results**: The elevated serum bilirubin concentrations on FEV1 were evaluated under moderate and high pollution levels. FEV1 was significantly higher in participants with high blood bilirubin levels compared to medium or low levels (p < 0.001 and p = 0.018, respectively). Participants with high levels of bilirubin had preserved FEV1 under exposure to high and medium pollution levels of both nitrogen oxide (NOx) and carbon monoxide (CO) pollutants (p = 0.003 and p = 0.022, respectively). The multivariate regression analysis revealed that the influence of bilirubin under conditions of air pollution remained significant even after adjustment for FEV1 confounders, but the interaction was not significant.

- **Conclusions**: Elevated serum bilirubin concentrations may contribute to preserved lung function in the face of air pollution.

### Jaundice in the adult patient [^116MrcMJ]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Jaundice in an adult patient can be caused by a wide variety of benign or life-threatening disorders. Organizing the differential diagnosis by prehepatic, intrahepatic, and posthepatic causes may help make the work-up more manageable.

- **Prehepatic causes**: Include hemolysis and hematoma resorption, which lead to elevated levels of unconjugated (indirect) bilirubin.
- **Intrahepatic disorders**: Can lead to unconjugated or conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. The conjugated (direct) bilirubin level is often elevated by alcohol, infectious hepatitis, drug reactions, and autoimmune disorders.
- **Posthepatic disorders**: Can also cause conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Gallstone formation is the most common and benign posthepatic process that causes jaundice; however, the differential diagnosis also includes serious conditions such as biliary tract infection, pancreatitis, and malignancies.

The laboratory work-up should begin with a urine test for bilirubin, which indicates that conjugated hyperbilirubinemia is present. If the complete blood count and initial tests for liver function and infectious hepatitis are unrevealing, the work-up typically proceeds to abdominal imaging by ultrasonography or computed tomographic scanning. In a few instances, more invasive procedures such as cholangiography or liver biopsy may be needed to arrive at a diagnosis.

### Neonatal cholestasis [^115K5C5A]. NeoReviews (2013). Low credibility.

Cholestatic jaundice is a common presenting feature of neonatal hepatobiliary and metabolic dysfunction. Any infant who remains jaundiced beyond age 2 to 3 weeks should have the serum bilirubin level fractionated into a conjugated (direct) and unconjugated (indirect) portion. Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia is never physiologic or normal. The differential diagnosis of cholestasis is extensive, and a step-wise approach based on the initial history and physical examination is useful to rapidly identify the underlying etiology. Early recognition of neonatal cholestasis is essential to ensure timely treatment and optimal prognosis. Even when specific treatment is not available, infants who have cholestasis benefit from early medical management and optimization of nutrition. Future studies are necessary to determine the most reliable and cost-effective method of universal screening for neonatal cholestasis.

### Quantitative systems toxicology identifies independent mechanisms for hepatotoxicity and bilirubin elevations due to AKR1C3 inhibitor BAY1128688 [^116MiUTa]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2023). High credibility.

BAY1128688 is a selective inhibitor of AKR1C3, recently investigated in a trial that was prematurely terminated due to drug-induced liver injury. These unexpected observations prompted the use of the quantitative systems toxicology model, DILIsym, to determine possible mechanisms of hepatotoxicity. Using mechanistic in vitro toxicity data as well as clinical exposure data, DILIsym predicted the potential for BAY1128688 to cause liver toxicity (elevations in serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT)) and elevations in serum bilirubin.

Initial simulations overpredicted hepatotoxicity and bilirubin elevations, so the BAY1128688 representation within DILIsym underwent optimization. The liver partition coefficient Kp was altered to align simulated bilirubin elevations with those observed clinically. Altering the mode of bile acid canalicular and basolateral efflux inhibition was necessary to accurately predict ALT elevations.

Optimization results support that bilirubin elevations observed early during treatment are due to altered bilirubin metabolism and transporter inhibition, which is independent of liver injury. The modeling further supports that on-treatment ALT elevations result from inhibition of bile acid transporters, particularly the bile salt excretory pump, leading to the accumulation of toxic bile acids.

The predicted dose-dependent intrinsic hepatotoxicity may increase patient susceptibility to an adaptive immune response, accounting for ALT elevations observed after the completion of treatment. These BAY1128688 simulations provide insight into the mechanisms behind hepatotoxicity.

### Systems pharmacology modeling of drug-induced hyperbilirubinemia: Differentiating hepatotoxicity and inhibition of enzymes/transporters [^1122jSpF]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Simulation of bilirubin levels in patients with impaired bilirubin metabolism and transport

The normal range of serum total bilirubin (TB) is 0.1–1.2 mg/dL, with about 3.0–4.3% of serum TB existing as conjugated bilirubin (CB). Respective baseline values in the bilirubin model are 0.55 mg/dL and 3.6%. The bilirubin model parameters were optimized to align with clinical bilirubin data in patients with impaired bilirubin metabolism and transport.

Rotor syndrome (RS) is a genetic disorder characterized by a near-complete loss of OATP1B1/1B3 expression. Patients with RS present with conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, suggesting two possibilities: non‐OATP‐mediated hepatic uptake pathways for unconjugated bilirubin (UB), and the involvement of OATP1B1/1B3 in the blood‐hepatocyte shuttling of CB. Therefore, hepatic uptake of UB was modeled with both non‐OATP and OATP‐mediated uptake processes, while hepatic uptake of CB was an OATP1B1/1B3‐mediated process.

In simulated patients with RS (with 70–95% impaired function of OATP1B1/1B3), the serum TB and percent serum CB were 2.28–6.91 mg/dL and 56.1–79%, respectively. These results are consistent with clinically observed values of 4.42 ± 2.18 mg/dL and 62.9 ± 12.1%.

The top panels represent observed (closed circles) and simulated (open circles) serum total bilirubin (TB) levels. The bottom panels represent observed (closed circles) and simulated (open circles) percent conjugated bilirubin (CB) compared to serum TB.

### Bilirubin production and the risk of bilirubin neurotoxicity [^111qYedE]. Seminars in Perinatology (2011). Low credibility.

Neonatal jaundice usually occurs in the transitional period after birth, presenting as an elevation of circulating bilirubin. Bilirubin neurotoxicity can occur if the levels of bilirubin become excessive (hyperbilirubinemia). This pathologic phenotype of newborn jaundice can develop because of excessive bilirubin production or impaired conjugation, with the risk for developing bilirubin-induced neurologic dysfunction depending on the degree of the resultant bilirubin load. The plasma bilirubin level, therefore, can be used to assess an infant's risk for developing bilirubin neurotoxicity relative to the infant's age in hours.

Because all infants have impaired conjugation ability, those at greatest risk are infants who have increased bilirubin production rates due to factors such as hemolysis. Therefore, developing potential preventive strategies and noninvasive technologies to treat and identify infants with increased bilirubin production rates is crucial to reducing the incidence of bilirubin-induced neurologic dysfunction.

### Hyperbilirubinemia in the early phase after allogeneic HSCT: Prognostic significance of the alkaline phosphatase/total bilirubin ratio [^111qQqap]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2013). Low credibility.

Hyperbilirubinemia in the early phase after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is due to various causes. One of the most important causes is veno-occlusive disease/sinusoidal obstructive syndrome (VOD/SOS). However, the prognosis of patients clinically diagnosed with SOS varies. We retrospectively evaluated 82 patients who underwent their first allogeneic HSCT. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis was administered as a combination of short-term methotrexate (MTX) and cyclosporine (CsA) (n = 77) or tacrolimus (n = 5).

Thirty-three patients developed hyperbilirubinemia, with a bilirubin level of at least 2 mg/dL, within 20 days after HSCT. Of these patients, 24 were diagnosed with VOD/SOS using the modified Seattle criteria. Twenty-six patients recovered to a bilirubin level of less than 2 mg/dL. We focused on the serum alkaline phosphatase/total bilirubin ratio (ALP/TB) at hyperbilirubinemia onset and found it significantly predicted recovery. Overall survival (OS) was significantly higher in patients with a lower ALP/TB ratio (P = 0.00056). Moreover, a lower ALP/TB ratio was associated with better survival even in patients clinically diagnosed with SOS (P < 0.001). The ALP/TB ratio at hyperbilirubinemia onset may be a useful predictor for the prognosis of hyperbilirubinemia and SOS early after HSCT.

### Clinical practice guideline revision: Management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation [^115NLkzy]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, more specifically with respect to bilirubin measurement, the AAP 2022 guidelines recommend measuring total serum bilirubin or transcutaneous bilirubin as soon as possible in infants noted to be jaundiced less than 24 hours after birth.

### Etiologies of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia in infancy: A systematic review of 1692 subjects [^1127UX6n]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Metabolic disorders associated with infantile conjugated hyperbilirubinemia are shown in Table 6. Among the 74 subjects reported to have a metabolic disease, galactosemia was identified in 27 subjects (36.5%). Thirteen subjects (17.6%) had undefined metabolic disease. Glycogen storage disease, tyrosinemia, and iron storage disease accounted for 9.5%, 8.1%, and 8.1% respectively.

- **Risk of bias across studies**: Study sizes ranged from 20 to 249 subjects; the largest study accounted for 14.7% of the total sample reducing the risk of selection bias in the pooled results. The subjects represented 12 countries and five continents; two studies drew patients from entire regions and the remaining studies each represented one clinical site. Eight of the centers were referral sites. Nine of the studies were prospective and eight were retrospective. Five studies focused on specific diagnostic techniques to differentiate biliary atresia from neonatal hepatitis.

Tiker et al. and Ipek et al. studied subjects admitted to neonatal intensive care units. In Tiker et al, etiologic prevalence rates differed from those of the other studies, presumably due to the study's narrow inclusion of newborns.

### ACG clinical guideline: Evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^117MpALN]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Clinicians are required to assess abnormal liver chemistries on a daily basis. The most commonly ordered liver chemistries are serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin. These tests should be referred to as liver chemistries or liver tests.

Hepatocellular injury is defined as a disproportionate elevation of AST and ALT levels compared with alkaline phosphatase levels. In contrast, cholestatic injury is characterized by a disproportionate elevation of alkaline phosphatase levels as compared with AST and ALT levels. The majority of bilirubin circulates as unconjugated bilirubin, and elevated conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or cholestasis.

Multiple studies have demonstrated that the presence of an elevated ALT is associated with increased liver-related mortality. A truly healthy normal ALT level ranges from 29 to 33 IU/L for males and 19 to 25 IU/L for females, and levels above this should be assessed. The degree of elevation of ALT and/or AST in the clinical setting aids in guiding the evaluation.

The evaluation of hepatocellular injury includes testing for viral hepatitis A, B, and C; assessment for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic liver disease; and screening for hereditary hemochromatosis, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson's disease, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. Additionally, a history of prescribed and over-the-counter medicines should be reviewed.

For the evaluation of an alkaline phosphatase elevation determined to be of hepatic origin, testing for primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis is recommended.

### Inhibition of OATP1B1/3 rather than UGT1A1 may be the major cause of the bilirubin elevation after atazanavir administration [^111MNhHv]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Low credibility.

The hyperbilirubinemia after atazanavir administration does not indicate liver injury. It is widely believed that the observed total bilirubin elevation is primarily due to UGT1A1 inhibition, as it is mainly driven by the elevation of unconjugated bilirubin levels. Indeed, the percentage of conjugated bilirubin in total bilirubin was reduced in atazanavir/r treatments. The observed large bilirubin elevation in atazanavir treatments also suggested that bilirubin appears to be more sensitive to UGT1A1 inhibition than other substrates, even though UGT1A1 is generally a low-affinity and high-capacity enzyme.

Because multiple steps and pathways are involved in bilirubin disposition, it was suggested to interpret the observed changes in bilirubin levels cautiously. In fact, discrepancies exist in observed bilirubin interactions if they were attributed to only UGT1A1 inhibition. For example, sorafenib is one of the strongest UGT1A1 inhibitors, which increased the AUC of SN-38 as a UGT1A1 substrate 1.67–2.20-fold. As sorafenib and atazanavir have comparable inhibitory potency (Appendix A, Table A2), it is expected that the frequency of hyperbilirubinemia would be similar in patients taking sorafenib and those taking atazanavir. However, less than 10% of patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma treated with sorafenib had grades 1 and 2 bilirubin elevations, and none had grades 3 and 4 bilirubin elevations, whereas approximately 40% of patients treated with atazanavir had grade 3 or higher bilirubin elevations. Also, Peer et al. reported minimal total bilirubin elevation with UGT1A1 exten…

### Clinical practice guideline revision: Management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation [^114gTqHs]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, specifically relating to bilirubin measurement, the AAP 2022 guidelines recommend considering the rate of increase to identify infants at higher risk of subsequent hyperbilirubinemia if more than one transcutaneous bilirubin or total serum bilirubin measurement is available. A rapid rate of increase, defined as ≥ 0.3 mg/dL/hour in the first 24 hours or ≥ 0.2 mg/dL/hour thereafter, should raise suspicion of hemolysis. In such cases, obtaining a direct antiglobulin test is advised if it has not already been conducted.

### Etiologies of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia in infancy: A systematic review of 1692 subjects [^116pqVEJ]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

In the newborn period and early infancy, cholestatic jaundice, or conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, results from hepatobiliary dysfunction. The prevalence of this disorder is estimated at 1 out of every 2500 live births; extrahepatic biliary atresia (EHBA) and idiopathic neonatal hepatitis (INH) account for two-thirds of cases of infantile cholestatic jaundice.

Most studies of infantile cholestatic jaundice focus on EHBA. Although this disorder is rare, with an estimated incidence of 1:15,000 live births, timely diagnosis and surgical intervention are required to avoid liver failure and death.

Excluding EHBA and INH, a myriad of potential etiologies for infantile cholestatic jaundice have been identified.

- **Obstructive processes**: These can be grossly structural or microscopic in nature (e.g. stones, plugs, or sclerosis of the biliary tract).

- **Intrinsic processes**: These affect hepatic cellular function (e.g. infections, metabolic disorders, endocrinopathies, chromosomal abnormalities, vascular abnormalities, toxins, neoplasms, and prematurity).

Given the absence of large, comprehensive patient series that define the spectrum and relative incidence of the etiologies of cholestasis in the newborn period and early infancy, this systematic review was undertaken.

### Systems pharmacology modeling of drug-induced hyperbilirubinemia: Differentiating hepatotoxicity and inhibition of enzymes/transporters [^115LYB2Y]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Elevations in serum bilirubin during drug treatment may indicate global liver dysfunction and a high risk of liver failure. However, drugs also can increase serum bilirubin in the absence of hepatic injury by inhibiting specific enzymes/transporters. We constructed a mechanistic model of bilirubin disposition based on known functional polymorphisms in bilirubin metabolism/transport. Using physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model-predicted drug exposure and enzyme/transporter inhibition constants determined in vitro, our model correctly predicted indinavir-mediated hyperbilirubinemia in humans and rats. Nelfinavir was predicted not to cause hyperbilirubinemia, consistent with clinical observations.

We next examined a new drug candidate that caused both elevations in serum bilirubin and biochemical evidence of liver injury in rats. Simulations suggest that bilirubin elevation primarily resulted from inhibition of transporters rather than global liver dysfunction. We conclude that mechanistic modeling of bilirubin can help elucidate underlying mechanisms of drug-induced hyperbilirubinemia, and thereby distinguish benign from clinically important elevations in serum bilirubin.

### Black race is not protective against hazardous bilirubin levels [^111pKb5t]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Although black race is traditionally considered protective against hyperbilirubinemia, black infants appear at increased risk of kernicterus. We found that, although black infants have a lower risk of developing total serum bilirubin levels ≥ 20 mg/dL than white infants, they appear at greater risk of developing levels ≥ 30 mg/dL.

### Gilbert's syndrome revisited [^115fqT1w]. Journal of Hepatology (2023). Low credibility.

Gilbert's syndrome, also known as benign hyperbilirubinaemia, was described more than 100 years ago. It is usually considered a physiological abnormality characterized by a mild elevation of the systemic level of unconjugated bilirubin, in the absence of any underlying liver or overt haemolytic disease. However, since the rediscovery of the potent antioxidant effects of bilirubin in the late 1980s, as well as multiple intracellular signaling pathways affected by bilirubin, an ever-increasing body of evidence suggests that individuals with Gilbert's syndrome may benefit from the mild hyperbilirubinaemia and are actually protected from the development of a wide variety of "diseases of civilization", such as cardiovascular diseases, certain cancers, and autoimmune or neurodegenerative diseases. This review analyzes the state of medical knowledge given recent discoveries in this rapidly developing field, their possible clinical significance, and provides a new perspective on this condition.

### Bilirubin decreases macrophage cholesterol efflux and ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 protein expression [^117B3fCC]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Mild but chronically elevated circulating unconjugated bilirubin is associated with reduced total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration, which is linked to reduced cardiovascular disease risk. We aimed to investigate whether unconjugated bilirubin influences macrophage cholesterol efflux as a potential mechanism for the altered circulating lipoprotein concentrations observed in hyperbilirubinemic individuals.

- **Methods and results**: Cholesterol efflux from macrophages was assessed using plasma obtained from normo- and hyperbilirubinemic (Gilbert syndrome) humans (n = 60 per group) or (heterozygote/homozygote Gunn) rats (n = 20 per group) as an acceptor. Hyperbilirubinemic plasma from patients with Gilbert syndrome and Gunn rats induced significantly reduced cholesterol efflux compared with normobilirubinemic plasma. Unconjugated bilirubin (3–17.1 μmol/L) exogenously added to plasma- or apolipoprotein A1–supplemented media also decreased macrophage cholesterol efflux in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. We also showed reduced protein expression of the binding cassette transporter A1, a transmembrane cholesterol transporter involved in apolipoprotein A1–mediated cholesterol efflux, in macrophages treated with unconjugated bilirubin and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from hyperbilirubinemic individuals. Furthermore, we demonstrated that bilirubin accelerates the degradation rate of the protein in macrophages.

- **Conclusions**: Cholesterol efflux from macrophages is decreased in the presence of plasma obtained from hyperbilirubinemic individuals.

### Hyperbilirubinemia in pediatrics: Evaluation and care [^115AjGE9]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2020). High credibility.

Hyperbilirubinemia is a common laboratory finding for children, particularly during infancy. It encompasses a wide range of diagnoses, from benign physiological changes to severe systemic illnesses. This paper discusses the evaluation and differential diagnosis of hyperbilirubinemia in infants and older children, based on the latest guidelines published by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition (NASPGHAN), and the European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition (ESPGHAN).

### Circulating markers of liver function and cardiovascular disease risk [^112GFrQG]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2015). Low credibility.

Measurement of serum concentrations of various liver enzymes and other non-enzymatic proteins and metabolites of heme metabolism (e.g. bilirubin) is often undertaken in clinical practice. Measurement of these liver function tests is simple, quick, and relatively inexpensive. However, interpreting the liver function test results in patients without evidence of liver disease is often challenging. Concentrations of some liver enzymes, such as γ-glutamyltransferase or alkaline phosphatase, and concentrations of liver-derived metabolites, such as bilirubin, may be influenced by metabolic processes beyond the liver, sometimes making interpretation of the test results difficult. This scenario frequently occurs both in individuals at risk of cardiovascular disease and in patients with known cardiovascular disease, often resulting in clinicians ignoring the test results. In this brief review, we discuss the evidence for associations between key serum liver function tests and cardiovascular disease risk. Where associations are robust, we provide an interpretation for possible mechanistic links between the liver function test and cardiovascular disease.

### Clinical practice guideline revision: Management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation [^112hX1yJ]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, specifically concerning bilirubin measurement, the AAP 2022 guidelines recommend measuring total serum bilirubin if the transcutaneous bilirubin exceeds or is within 3 mg/dL of the phototherapy treatment threshold, or if the transcutaneous bilirubin is ≥ 15 mg/dL.

### Association between elevated serum bilirubin levels with preserved lung function under conditions of exposure to air pollution [^116Mp5pG]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

The main finding of this study is the positive association between total serum bilirubin concentrations and lung function in subjects exposed to elevated levels of air pollution. Our relatively large study sample (n = 15,605) was comprised of apparently healthy individuals residing in a major metropolitan area, supporting the likelihood that our findings are applicable to other large urban areas worldwide.

Our results of elevated serum bilirubin levels being associated with improved lung function are compatible with the findings in Swiss and South Korean populations that also described positive associations between serum bilirubin levels and lung function in healthy populations. Moreover, there was an association between a lower risk of respiratory disease and all-cause mortality in patients with normal-range bilirubin levels, while relatively higher levels of bilirubin were associated with a lower risk of respiratory diseases. In another study, bilirubin levels were associated with a longer 6-minute walk distance and a better quality of life.

Bilirubin is known as a potential antioxidant with anti-inflammatory properties. Elevated bilirubin levels have cytoprotective properties, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiproliferative effects. These effects seem to be mediated by an elevated heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) activity which may be moderated by genetic variations or environmental factors. The role of HO-1 in correlation with the environment was shown in some other studies as well. Moreover, environmental cadmium moderates diabetes type 2 through HO-1.

### Severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia and kernicterus: Are these still problems in the third millennium [^111RfWAS]? Neonatology (2011). Low credibility.

Despite efforts to eliminate permanent and irreversible brain damage due to bilirubin encephalopathy and kernicterus, these conditions continue to accompany us into the third millennium. This phenomenon occurs not only in developing countries with emerging medical systems but in Westernized countries as well. Comprehensive guidelines to detect newborns with jaundice and treat those in whom hyperbilirubinemia has already developed have been formulated in several countries, but they have not been successful in completely eliminating the problem.

In this appraisal of the situation, we review selected aspects of bilirubin encephalopathy and kernicterus. We highlight recent reports of severe hyperbilirubinemia and kernicterus, discuss some of the factors responsible for the continuing appearance of these conditions, and briefly review what can be done to decrease bilirubin-related morbidity and mortality to the minimum.

### Clinical practice guideline revision: Management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation [^112pSgbA]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, specifically concerning post-discharge care, the AAP 2022 guidelines recommend calculating and using the difference between the bilirubin concentration measured closest to discharge and the phototherapy threshold at the time of bilirubin measurement. This should begin at least 12 hours after birth to guide follow-up if patient discharge is being considered.

### An emergency medicine approach to neonatal hyperbilirubinemia [^114FnTZA]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Jaundice (also known as hyperbilirubinemia) is a yellowish-greenish pigmentation of the sclera and skin caused by an increase in bilirubin production or a defect in bilirubin elimination. Management of hyperbilirubinemia is one of the most common reasons for readmission of a newborn. Prolonged unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia can result in acute bilirubin encephalopathy and eventually develop into chronic bilirubin encephalopathy (kernicterus). Kernicterus, the feared complication of hyperbilirubinemia, was considered almost extinct but has recently re-emerged despite the virtual elimination of Rh disease. This review provides a systematic approach to the presentation, evaluation, and management of the jaundiced newborn.

### Serum bilirubin and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): A systematic review [^111cQhJw]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Higher serum bilirubin within the normal range may be associated with lower mortality and risk of COPD exacerbations, a reduced incidence in COPD diagnosis, and improved lung function. Interventional trials are needed to test if medications that raise serum bilirubin levels can safely improve COPD outcomes.

### Genome-wide analyses of neonatal jaundice reveal a marked departure from adult bilirubin metabolism [^115bTH77]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Jaundice affects almost all neonates in their first days of life and is caused by the accumulation of bilirubin. Although the core biochemistry of bilirubin metabolism is well understood, it is not clear why some neonates experience more severe jaundice and require treatment with phototherapy. Here, we present the first genome-wide association study of neonatal jaundice at the time of writing in nearly 30,000 parent-offspring trios from Norway (cases ≈ 2000). The alternate allele of a common missense variant affecting the sequence of UGT1A4 reduces the susceptibility to jaundice five-fold, which replicated in separate cohorts of neonates of African American and European ancestries. eQTL colocalization analyses indicate that the association may be driven by regulation of UGT1A1 in the intestines, but not in the liver. Our results reveal marked differences in the genetic variants involved in neonatal jaundice compared to those regulating bilirubin levels in adults, suggesting distinct genetic mechanisms for the same biological pathways.

### Neonatal indirect hyperbilirubinemia [^116XW4Zq]. NeoReviews (2020). Low credibility.

Neonatal indirect hyperbilirubinemia (IHB) is caused by an imbalance in bilirubin production and elimination. Approximately 60% of term and 80% of preterm infants develop jaundice within the first week of life. This review seeks to provide a thorough understanding of the physiology of bilirubin, the etiology of IHB, and the management of severe IHB. Phototherapy and exchange transfusion remain the mainstays of treatment for severe IHB. Noninvasive screening tools, innovative treatments, and a better understanding of how prematurity and genetics contribute to severe IHB have improved our understanding of IHB and may help eliminate the hazards associated with severe IHB, including kernicterus spectrum disorder.

### Artifactual hyperbilirubinemia due to paraprotein interference [^112cn9Cy]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Paraprotein interference in automated chemistry is uncommon. We describe two patients with paraproteinemia and elevated total bilirubin levels measured erroneously using the Roche total bilirubin assay.

- **Objectives**: To explain the mechanism of this artifactual hyperbilirubinemia and to determine its frequency in patients with monoclonal or increased immunoglobulins.

- **Materials and methods**: The assay was performed manually using serum from two index patients and from control patients (without M proteins). Total bilirubin was also determined using another manufacturer's assay. A prospective study was then undertaken using serum from 100 consecutive patients with various monoclonal gammopathies and from 13 patients with polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia and cryoglobulins. For all patients, serum immunoglobulin (Ig) G, IgA, IgM, total and direct bilirubin, creatinine, and a direct spectrophotometric assessment of icterus were measured.

- **Results**: After the addition of assay reagents, a white precipitate formed in the reaction mixtures containing serum from the index patients, but not in other samples. This turbidity, rather than the expected color change to pink, increased the absorbance and falsely elevated the total bilirubin value. Serum from both index patients was anicteric, their direct bilirubin measurements were unaffected, and total bilirubin measured using an alternate assay was normal. Among the 113 patients studied, no additional spurious total bilirubin values were detected.

- **Conclusion**: Paraprotein interference with the Roche automated total bilirubin assay is noteworthy, but no additional cases of spurious total bilirubin values were found among the studied patients.

### Association between elevated serum bilirubin levels with preserved lung function under conditions of exposure to air pollution [^111wTHVp]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

The key finding of this study was that elevated serum bilirubin concentrations are associated with preserved lung function in healthy individuals exposed to elevated levels of air pollution. Bilirubin should be further studied as a surrogate marker for lung function in respiratory diseases in which there are elevated levels of oxidative stress.

### Patients with biliary atresia have elevated direct/conjugated bilirubin levels shortly after birth [^115QhRTS]. Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Healthy infants are thought to acquire biliary atresia (BA) in the first weeks of life. Because those diagnosed earlier have better outcomes, we were interested in determining the earliest time BA could be detected. We started by examining the immediate postnatal period, hypothesizing that newborns would not yet have acquired the disease and would still have normal direct/conjugated bilirubin (DB/CB) levels.

- **Patients and methods**: Newborn DB/CB levels were obtained retrospectively from birth hospitals. Subjects with BA were born between 2007 and 2010 and cared for at Texas Children's Hospital. Those with BA splenic malformation syndrome or born prematurely were excluded. Control subjects were term newborns who later never developed neonatal liver disease.

- **Results**: Of the 61 subjects with BA, 56% had newborn DB/CB levels measured. All DB/CB levels exceeded laboratory norms and rose over time. At 24 to 48 hours of life, subjects with BA had mean DB levels significantly higher than those of controls (1.4 ± 0.43 vs. 0.19 ± 0.075 mg/dL, P < .0001), even while their mean total bilirubin (TB) levels remained below phototherapy limits. Finally, despite the elevated DB/CB levels, the majority of patients (79%) had normal DB:TB ratios ≤ 0.2.

- **Conclusions**: Patients with BA have elevated DB/CB levels shortly after birth. To detect affected infants earlier and improve outcomes, the results suggest two possibilities: (1) screen all newborns for elevated DB/CB levels, rather than just those who appear jaundiced; and (2) follow all newborns with elevated DB/CB levels.

### Elevidys [^1116D6rs]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Monitor post-Elevidys administration carefully. Assess liver function, including clinical examination, GGT, and total bilirubin, on a weekly basis for the first three months. Continue monitoring if clinically indicated until results become unremarkable, such as when the clinical exam, GGT, and total bilirubin levels return to near baseline levels [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Specific Populations (8.6)].

Obtain platelet counts weekly for the first two weeks [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Continue monitoring if clinically indicated. Measure troponin-I weekly for the first month [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Continue monitoring if clinically indicated.

### Bilirubin: The yellow hormone [^114hgbs5]. Journal of Hepatology (2021). Low credibility.

Bilirubin is a tetrapyrrolic compound originating from heme catabolism. Although originally considered only a potentially dangerous waste product, it has become increasingly evident that this molecule represents an important modulator of various biological functions in the human body. Bilirubin appears to have versatile functions, from cell signaling, behaving almost like a "real" hormonal substance, modulation of metabolism, to immune regulation, affecting biological activities with apparent clinical and even therapeutic consequences.

These activities may be the reason for the lower incidence of diseases of civilization (cardiovascular diseases, arterial hypertension, diabetes, obesity, metabolic syndrome, certain cancers, autoimmune, and neurodegenerative diseases) observed in individuals with a chronic mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, a typical sign of Gilbert's syndrome. While higher serum concentrations of unconjugated bilirubin may serve as an important protective factor against these diseases, low levels of bilirubin are associated with the opposite effect.

### Hyperbilirubinemia in the 2000s: What should we do next [^113T214o]. American Journal of Perinatology (2003). Low credibility.

Changes in healthcare policy mandating early discharge of healthy, full-term infants and the higher prevalence of breastfeeding of newborns have contributed to an increased number of term infants being readmitted to the hospital for hyperbilirubinemia. At high levels, total serum bilirubin causes kernicterus, which is associated with severe neurological sequelae. This article provides a review of prior studies that have examined whether and at what levels total serum bilirubin affects neurodevelopmental outcomes in term infants. In addition, the article reviews some approaches in the literature that suggest means of preventing high levels of hyperbilirubinemia in term infants.

### Longitudinal blood pressure control, long-term mortality, and predictive utility of serum liver enzymes and bilirubin in hypertensive patients [^113mETp6]. Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

Liver biochemistry is not only a common screening test in outpatient and primary care settings but is also increasingly assessed as part of insurance medicals. Bilirubin has been shown to be an effective antioxidant both in vitro and in vivo, positively related to the total serum antioxidant capacity in humans and able to suppress the oxidation of LDL cholesterol. Several population studies have reported a significant negative correlation between serum bilirubin concentrations and blood pressure (BP), the severity of atherosclerosis, incident coronary heart disease, and decreased mortality risk. Interestingly, there is also evidence for both positive and negative relationships with mortality for alanine transaminase (ALT), even though higher, not low, ALT is also considered a marker for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. In contrast, γ-glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT) is associated with a positive relationship to mortality and cardiovascular disease.

A potential causal role for bilirubin is supported by studies of human sequence variations in the UGT1A1 gene, which result in moderate increases in plasma bilirubin and a decreased risk for the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Furthermore, in animal studies, moderate hyperbilirubinemia, induced either by knockout of UGT1A1 or blockade with indinavir, was associated with a 50% decline in BP response to angiotensin II and no effect on glomerular filtration rate. Several studies in both genetic and experimental models have demonstrated that heme oxygenase-1 induction (which can increase bilirubin levels) can attenuate the development.

### Etiologies of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia in infancy: A systematic review of 1692 subjects [^116tgsXd]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

The results of the literature search are depicted in Figure 1. Searches of Medline and EMBASE databases yielded 193 references. An additional 44 citations were found by extensively searching the bibliographies of selected articles. From the 237 studies identified, 180 studies were excluded following a cursory review of the title, abstract, and, when necessary, the results section. The full text of the remaining 57 articles was reviewed in detail. Forty of these studies were excluded for various reasons:

- **Low specificity in reporting**: 11 reports failed to report specific diagnoses.
- **Narrow inclusion criteria**: 6 reports had inclusion criteria that were too narrow; 5 reports had subjects with previously identified disease processes.
- **Misaligned subject focus**: 6 reports included patients without conjugated hyperbilirubinemia.
- **Study type exclusion**: 6 reports were neither case series nor cohort studies.
- **Inadequate clinical evaluation**: 2 reports failed to include a detailed clinical evaluation.
- **Other specific exclusions**: One report each had vague inclusion criteria, non-consecutive patients, included the same patient population from another selected study, or had a sample size of less than 10.

The remaining 17 studies form the basis of this systematic review.

### Management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation [^113h3u4e]. Pediatrics (2004). Low credibility.

Jaundice occurs in most newborn infants. Most jaundice is benign, but because of the potential toxicity of bilirubin, newborn infants must be monitored to identify those who might develop severe hyperbilirubinemia and, in rare cases, acute bilirubin encephalopathy or kernicterus. The focus of this guideline is to reduce the incidence of severe hyperbilirubinemia and bilirubin encephalopathy while minimizing the risks of unintended harm, such as maternal anxiety, decreased breastfeeding, and unnecessary costs or treatment. Although kernicterus should almost always be preventable, cases continue to occur. These guidelines provide a framework for the prevention and management of hyperbilirubinemia in newborn infants of 35 or more weeks of gestation.

- **Recommended actions**: In every infant, we recommend that clinicians:
	1. Promote and support successful breastfeeding.
	2. Perform a systematic assessment before discharge for the risk of severe hyperbilirubinemia.
	3. Provide early and focused follow-up based on the risk assessment.
	4. When indicated, treat newborns with phototherapy or exchange transfusion to prevent the development of severe hyperbilirubinemia and, possibly, bilirubin encephalopathy (kernicterus).

### False-positive paracetamol levels in a patient with hyperbilirubinaemia: Clinical perspectives [^1176bv4e]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Serum concentrations of paracetamol are measured to investigate the cause of acute hepatitis, monitor the clearance of paracetamol from the body, and determine if supratherapeutic levels warrant treatment with N-acetylcysteine (NAC). A 49-year-old man treated for ischaemic colitis developed worsening renal and liver function tests. As part of the investigation of hepatorenal failure, paracetamol levels were requested, which were elevated at 14 mg/L (normal < 4 mg/L), resulting in treatment with NAC. Despite treatment, levels of paracetamol remained elevated, and the link between hyperbilirubinaemia and false-positive paracetamol levels was identified.

Bilirubin and its by-products have intense absorbance in the ultraviolet and visible regions of the electromagnetic spectrum, causing interference in the enzymatic colorimetric assay most commonly used to measure paracetamol concentration, resulting in false-positive paracetamol levels. Laboratories correct for this interference above a predetermined bilirubin concentration, termed the Icteric Index; however, in our case, this interference occurred at a lower level of hyperbilirubinaemia than previously identified as significant. This interaction was found to be more significant at lower bilirubin levels when low or no paracetamol levels were present in the serum, resulting in a change to laboratory practice and development of a 'sliding scale' approach to analysis. Bilirubin or Icteric Index measurement is recommended for all laboratories that use the enzymatic colorimetric assay for paracetamol measurement.

### Elevated serum bilirubin level correlates with the development of cholangiocarcinoma, subsequent liver transplantation, and death in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis [^113zdzMx]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Predicting the clinical course of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is difficult, as there are currently a paucity of studies evaluating serum chemistries as predictors of conventional clinical endpoints. This study's purpose was to prognosticate key clinical endpoints in patients with PSC who had elevated serum liver chemistries at their initial presentation.

- **Methods**: We performed a retrospective cohort study of PSC patients at our institution. The aim of our study was to determine the association between elevated liver chemistries at initial presentation — bilirubin, alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, or alkaline phosphatase — and a primary outcome of either cholangiocarcinoma, liver transplantation, death, or a composite of the three. The secondary endpoints examined were the development of severe biliary ductal disease and the need for biliary stent placement.

- **Results**: Eighty-one PSC patients (61 males and 20 females) were included in this study. By univariate analysis, there was a significant association between initial bilirubin elevation > 2x the upper limit of normal (ULN) and death. Patients with bilirubin levels > 2xULN showed an association with the severity of biliary ductal disease. Elevated serum bilirubin levels predicted the progression of the disease.

### Inherited disorders of bilirubin clearance [^1163DvT3]. Pediatric Research (2016). Low credibility.

Inherited disorders of hyperbilirubinemia may be caused by increased bilirubin production or decreased bilirubin clearance. Reduced hepatic bilirubin clearance can be due to defective:

- **Unconjugated bilirubin uptake and intrahepatic storage**
- **Conjugation of glucuronic acid to bilirubin (e.g. Gilbert syndrome, Crigler-Najjar syndrome, Lucey-Driscoll syndrome, breast milk jaundice)**
- **Bilirubin excretion into bile (Dubin-Johnson syndrome)**
- **Conjugated bilirubin re-uptake (Rotor syndrome)**:

In this review, the molecular mechanisms and clinical manifestations of these conditions are described, as well as approaches to diagnosis and therapy.
