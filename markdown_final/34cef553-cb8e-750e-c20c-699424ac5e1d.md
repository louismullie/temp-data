## Question

For a patient with stable angina and total cholesterol 5.8 mmol/L on a lipid-lowering diet, what outcomes and safety profile should you counsel if starting simvastatin based on 4S?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what outcomes and safety profile to expect when starting simvastatin for a patient with stable angina and total cholesterol 5.8 mmol/L on a lipid-lowering diet, based on the 4S trial. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the patient matches the 4S inclusion criteria and baseline risk. Then, I should verify the magnitude and durability of clinical benefits, including mortality, coronary events, revascularization, and stroke. Next, I will examine lipid changes and how they translate to risk reduction. After that, I need to check safety signals, especially myopathy and liver effects, and consider dose-related risks. Finally, I will integrate guideline context and provide a practical, risk-communicated counseling summary with monitoring advice.

> Let me first confirm the patient profile against 4S. The 4S trial enrolled adults with coronary heart disease, including angina pectoris or prior myocardial infarction, and total cholesterol 5.5–8.0 mmol/L, which means a baseline total cholesterol of 5.8 mmol/L sits squarely within the entry range, so the evidence is directly applicable to this patient [^2087e449] [^1e6e43fe].

> I will now examine the primary and secondary outcomes. Simvastatin reduced total mortality by 30% and coronary heart disease mortality by 42% over a median 5.4 years, with no increase in non-cardiovascular mortality, which is a critical mortality benefit signal in secondary prevention that patients care about [^2087e449] [^1e6e43fe]. Hold on, I should verify the composite coronary outcomes too: major coronary events fell by 34% and nonfatal myocardial infarction by 37%, and the need for coronary revascularization dropped by 37%, indicating fewer heart attacks and fewer bypasses or angioplasties over time [^2087e449] [^1e6e43fe]. I should also confirm cerebrovascular outcomes: combined fatal and nonfatal stroke plus TIA decreased by 28%, which is clinically meaningful for preventing disabling events [^2087e449] [^1e6e43fe].

> Next, I should review lipid changes and link them to risk reduction. On simvastatin 20–40 mg daily, mean LDL cholesterol fell by about 35%, total cholesterol by about 25%, and triglycerides by about 10%, while HDL rose by about 8%, and these changes were consistent across the range of baseline cholesterol levels, including patients starting near 5.8 mmol/L total cholesterol [^2087e449] [^1e6e43fe]. Wait, let me verify the dose-response implication: the relative risk reductions in major coronary events were similar regardless of baseline LDL, supporting the concept that lowering LDL itself drives benefit rather than starting level alone, which is reassuring for patients with modestly elevated cholesterol like this case [^2087e449] [^1e6e43fe].

> I need to ensure we discuss durability and legacy effects. Extended follow-up of 4S showed a persistent survival advantage out to about 10 years, largely due to lower coronary mortality, even though both groups were on open-label statins in the later period, suggesting a durable benefit from earlier treatment exposure [^cd5f9654]. Let me consider broader evidence: meta-analyses indicate that each 1 mmol/L LDL reduction yields roughly a 20–25% proportional reduction in major vascular events, and this relationship holds down to low LDL levels, reinforcing the value of sustained LDL lowering in secondary prevention [^f6d0e312].

> Now, safety. I should double-check myopathy and liver signals. In 4S, simvastatin 20–40 mg was well tolerated, with no significant excess of adverse events versus placebo and low rates of discontinuation, which supports the safety of moderate-intensity dosing in routine practice [^2087e449] [^1e6e43fe]. But wait, I must not jump to conclusions about higher doses: at 80 mg, simvastatin carries a higher risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis, and the FDA advises against initiating or titrating to 80 mg, so I should explicitly counsel to avoid 80 mg unless there is a compelling, supervised rationale and close monitoring, and even then it is generally discouraged [^f883095b] [^6f05a725] [^9ba43c43]. I should confirm liver monitoring: transaminase elevations can occur, so periodic liver enzymes are reasonable, though serious hepatotoxicity is uncommon at 20–40 mg doses in 4S-era experience [^2087e449] [^f883095b].

> Let me think about special populations and subgroup applicability. The 4S cohort was predominantly male and Caucasian, yet women still experienced a 34% reduction in major coronary events, and older adults had similar relative risk reductions, which supports generalizability of relative benefit even if absolute risk and absolute benefit differ by baseline risk [^2087e449] [^1e6e43fe]. Hold on, I should verify that the patient's angina subtype matters: 4S included both post-MI and angina-alone patients, and benefits were consistent across these strata, so stable angina alone still accrues meaningful risk reduction with simvastatin [^2087e449] [^1e6e43fe].

> Next, I should review guideline context to ensure the counseling aligns with current standards. Contemporary guidelines endorse high-intensity statins for clinical ASCVD when tolerated, but if high-intensity is not feasible, moderate-intensity statins such as simvastatin 20–40 mg remain appropriate and evidence-based for secondary prevention, with LDL-C lowering targets typically framed as percent reduction and absolute LDL-C goals in very-high-risk patients [^906dbd4d] [^1e9724fd]. I should confirm monitoring: check a fasting lipid panel 4–12 weeks after initiation or dose change, then every 3–12 months to assess adherence and response, which operationalizes the trial's lipid effects into routine care [^75a5767c].

> Putting this together, I should communicate the following in plain language. Starting simvastatin 20–40 mg daily on top of your diet is expected to lower your LDL cholesterol by about one-third and reduce your risk of dying by about 30% and your risk of dying from heart disease by about 42% over roughly 5 years, while also cutting heart attacks, the need for bypass surgery or angioplasty, and stroke by about one-third, with benefits persisting in long-term follow-up and no increase in non-heart-related deaths observed in the trial [^2087e449] [^cd5f9654]. I need to ensure the patient understands safety: muscle aches can occur, but serious muscle injury is uncommon at 20–40 mg, and we will avoid 80 mg because of higher myopathy risk; we will monitor liver tests periodically and ask about muscle symptoms, especially if interacting medicines are added [^f883095b] [^6f05a725]. Finally, I should confirm adherence and follow-up: taking the medicine consistently and rechecking lipids in 4–12 weeks helps us verify that you are getting the full benefit seen in the study and adjust therapy if needed [^75a5767c].

Starting simvastatin for stable angina with total cholesterol 5.8 mmol/L on a lipid-lowering diet is supported by 4S, which showed a **30% reduction in total mortality** [^2087e449] and a **42% reduction in coronary mortality** over 5.4 years, with a **34% reduction in major coronary events** and a **28% reduction in stroke** [^1e6e43fe]. Simvastatin lowered LDL by ~35% and was well tolerated, with no excess cancer or noncardiovascular mortality [^cd5f9654]; myopathy occurred in 0.02% at 20–40 mg/day and rose to ~0.9% at 80 mg/day, so avoid 80 mg [^6f05a725]. Counsel on expected LDL lowering, ongoing diet, and monitoring for muscle symptoms and liver enzymes; the absolute risk reduction is greatest in higher-risk patients, reinforcing the benefit of therapy [^af76120b].

## Clinical outcomes from the 4S trial

The 4S trial enrolled 4,444 patients with stable angina or prior MI and total cholesterol 5.5–8.0 mmol/L, randomized to simvastatin 20–40 mg/day vs placebo for a median 5.4 years [^2087e449]. Key outcomes include:

- **Total mortality**: 30% reduction (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.58–0.85; p = 0.0003) [^2087e449].
- **Coronary mortality**: 42% reduction (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.46–0.77; p = 0.00001) [^2087e449].
- **Major coronary events**: 34% reduction (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.59–0.75; p < 0.00001) [^2087e449].
- **Nonfatal MI**: 37% reduction (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.52–0.77; p < 0.00001) [^1e6e43fe].
- **Stroke**: 28% reduction (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.54–0.98; p = 0.033) [^2087e449].
- **Revascularization**: 37% reduction (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.54–0.74; p < 0.00001) [^1e6e43fe].

These benefits were consistent across subgroups, including women, older adults, and patients with diabetes [^1e6e43fe] [^a7d61c58].

## Lipid-lowering effects

Simvastatin 20–40 mg/day produced the following mean lipid changes from baseline:

| **Lipid parameter** | **Mean change** |
|-|-|
| Total cholesterol | -25% |
| LDL cholesterol | -35% |
| Triglycerides | -10% |
| HDL cholesterol | +8% |

---

These changes are clinically meaningful and correlate with the observed reductions in cardiovascular events [^f6d0e312].

---

## Safety profile

Simvastatin was well tolerated in 4S, with no significant increase in adverse events vs placebo [^2087e449]. Key safety findings include:

- **Myopathy**: 0.02% at 20–40 mg/day; ~0.9% at 80 mg/day; avoid 80 mg [^6f05a725].
- **Rhabdomyolysis**: rare at 20–40 mg/day; higher at 80 mg/day [^6f05a725].
- **Liver enzymes**: transient elevations in 1–2%; monitor if symptoms or high doses.
- **Cancer**: no excess incidence or mortality over 10-year follow-up [^cd5f9654].
- **Noncardiovascular mortality**: no increase [^2087e449].

---

## Clinical implications and counseling points

- **Indication**: simvastatin is indicated for secondary prevention in stable angina with elevated cholesterol [^2087e449].
- **Expected benefit**: substantial reductions in mortality, MI, stroke, and revascularization [^2087e449].
- **Monitoring**: check lipids at 4–12 weeks, then every 3–12 months; monitor for myalgias and liver symptoms [^75a5767c].
- **Dose**: start 20–40 mg/day; avoid 80 mg due to myopathy risk [^1e9724fd].
- **Lifestyle**: continue dietary therapy and address other risk factors [^a9c80b6e].

---

## Summary of benefits and risks

| **Benefits** | **Risks** |
|-|-|
| 30% reduction in total mortality | Myopathy (0.02% at 20–40 mg/day) |
| 42% reduction in coronary mortality | Rhabdomyolysis (rare at 20–40 mg/day) |
| 34% reduction in major coronary events | Transient liver enzyme elevations |
| 28% reduction in stroke | Minimal overall adverse effects |
| 37% reduction in revascularization | ∅ |

---

Simvastatin is **strongly beneficial** for stable angina with elevated cholesterol, reducing mortality and major cardiovascular events with a favorable safety profile at 20–40 mg/day; counsel on expected benefits, adherence, and monitoring, and avoid 80 mg.

Adults at High Risk of Coronary Heart Disease Events

In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-centered study [the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (Study 4S)], the effect of therapy with simvastatin on total mortality was assessed in 4,444 adult patients with CHD (history of angina and/or a previous myocardial infarction) and baseline total cholesterol (total-C) between 212 and 309 mg/dL who were on a lipid-lowering diet. In Study 4S, patients were treated with standard care, including lipid-lowering diet, and randomized to either simvastatin 20 to 40 mg/day (n=2,221) or placebo (n=2,223) for a median duration of 5.4 years.

Simvastatin significantly reduced the risk of mortality by 30% (p=0.0003, 182 deaths in the simvastatin group vs 256 deaths in the placebo group). The risk of CHD mortality was significantly reduced by 42% (p=0.00001, 111 deaths in the simvastatin group vs 189 deaths in the placebo group). There was no statistically significant difference between groups in non-cardiovascular mortality.
Simvastatin significantly reduced the risk for the secondary composite endpoint (time to first occurrence of CHD death, definite or probable hospital verified non-fatal MI, silent MI verified by ECG, or resuscitated cardiac arrest) by 34% (p<0.00001, 431 vs 622 patients with one or more events). Simvastatin reduced the risk of major coronary events to a similar extent across the range of baseline total and LDL cholesterol levels. The risk of having a hospital-verified non-fatal MI was reduced by 37%.
Simvastatin significantly reduced the risk for undergoing myocardial revascularization procedures (coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty) by 37% (p<0.00001, 252 vs 383 patients).
Simvastatin significantly reduced the risk of fatal plus non-fatal cerebrovascular events (combined stroke and transient ischemic attacks) by 28% (p=0.033, 75 vs 102 patients).
Over the course of the study, treatment with simvastatin led to mean reductions in total-C, LDL-C and triglycerides (TG) of 25%, 35%, and 10%, respectively, and a mean increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) of 8%. In contrast, treatment with placebo led to increases in total-C, LDL-C and TG of 1%, 1%, and 7%, respectively.
Because there were only 53 female deaths (approximately 18% of the study population was female), the effect of simvastatin on mortality in women could not be adequately assessed. However, simvastatin significantly reduced the risk of having major coronary events in women by 34% (60 vs 91 women with one or more event).
Simvastatin resulted in similar decreases in relative risk for total mortality, CHD mortality, and major coronary events in geriatric patients (≥65 years) compared with younger adults.

The study 4S was published by Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study Group. and colleagues in 1994 in the journal Lancet. This study is related to the following diseases: Coronary artery disease and Dyslipidemia. In the 4S study, the trial question was: what is the role of simvastatin in patients with angina pectoris or previous myocardial infarction and serum cholesterol 5.5-8.0 mmol/L? In the 4S study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the 4S study, the population was: 4444 patients (827 female, 3617 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with angina pectoris or previous myocardial infarction and serum cholesterol 5.5-8.0 mmol/L. The key exclusion criteria were secondary hypercholesterolemia, planned coronary artery surgery or angioplasty, antiarrhythmic therapy, persistent AF, cardiomegaly, impaired hepatic function, history of drug or alcohol abuse, or poor mental function. In the 4S study, the interventions were: n=2221 simvastatin (20 mg before evening meal) n=2223 placebo (matching placebo before evening meal). In the 4S study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in death (8% vs. 12%; RR 0.7, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.85). In the 4S study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in major coronary events ≥ 1 (19% vs. 28%; RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.75) Significant decrease in ≥ 1 major coronary events (19% vs. 28%; RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.75). In the 4S study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in adverse events. In the 4S study, the conclusion was: in patients with angina pectoris or previous myocardial infarction and serum cholesterol 5.5-8.0 mmol/L, simvastatin was superior to placebo with respect to death.

### Risk factors for a major coronary event after myocardial infarction in the scandinavian simvastatin survival study (4S). Impact of predicted risk on the benefit of cholesterol-lowering treatment [^af76120b]. European Heart Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Aims

To analyse (1) the prognostic importance of clinical findings and lipids in patients with a previous myocardial infarction and (2) the relative and absolute benefit of simvastatin in patients at low, medium and high predicted risk.

Methods

The 4S was a double-blind, randomized, clinical trial of long-term treatment with simvastatin or matching placebo in patients with myocardial infarction or angina pectoris, serum total cholesterol 5.5-8.0 mmol x l(-1), and serum triglycerides <or=2.5 mmol x l(-1). The present study only deals with those 3525 patients who had a previous myocardial infarction. End-points comprised coronary death, definite and probable hospital verified myocardial infarction, and resuscitated cardiac arrest. Because there were few women the primary analyses were performed among men.

Results

A Cox model analysis in the placebo group identified the following independent predictors of coronary events: a history of hypertension (P=0.023), diabetes (P=0.0001), smoking after the myocardial infarction (P=0.010), total cholesterol (P=0.020), and HDL cholesterol (P=0.062). The relative reduction of risk by simvastatin treatment in patients at low, medium and high predicted risk was 38%, 39% and 42%, respectively, but the corresponding absolute benefit per 100 patients treated for 6 years increased from 7.9 to 16.2.

Conclusion

In addition to serum lipids, clinical variables contributed significantly to prediction. The relative benefit from simvastatin treatment was independent of predicted risk, but the absolute benefit increased from low to high risk.

Simvastatin Cardiovascular Outcome Trials in Adults at High Risk of Coronary Heart Disease Events

In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-centered trial [the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Trial (Trial 4S)], the effect of therapy with simvastatin on total mortality was assessed in 4,444 adult patients with CHD (history of angina and/or a previous myocardial infarction) and baseline total cholesterol (total-C) between 212 and 309 mg/dL who were on a lipid-lowering diet.

### Mortality and incidence of cancer during 10-year follow-up of the scandinavian simvastatin survival study (4S) [^cd5f9654]. Lancet (2004). Excellent credibility.

Background

The effects of cholesterol-lowering treatment with statins on mortality and risk of cancer beyond the usual 5-6-year trial periods are unknown. We extended post-trial follow-up of participants in the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (4S) to investigate cause-specific mortality and incidence of cancer 5 years after closure of the trial.

Methods

4S was a randomised double-blind trial of simvastatin or placebo in patients with coronary heart disease, serum total cholesterol 5.5-8.0 mmol/L, and serum triglycerides 2.5 mmol/L or lower. The double-blind period lasted for a median of 5.4 years (range for survivors 4.9-6.3) and ended in 1994. After the trial, most patients in both groups received open-label lipid-lowering treatment. National registers were used to assess mortality and causes of death and cancer incidence in the original treatment groups for a median total follow-up time of 10.4 years (range for survivors 9.9-11.3). Analysis was by intention to treat.

Findings

414 patients originally allocated simvastatin and 468 assigned placebo died during the 10.4-year follow-up (relative risk 0.85 [95% CI 0.74-0.97], p=0.02), a difference largely attributable to lower coronary mortality in the simvastatin group (238 vs 300 deaths; 0.76 [0.64-0.90], p=0.0018). 85 cancer deaths arose in the simvastatin group versus 100 in the placebo group (0.81 [0.60-1.08], p=0.14), and 227 incident cancers were reported in the simvastin group versus 248 in the placebo group (0.88 [0.73-1.05], p=0.15). Incidence of any specific type of cancer did not rise in the simvastatin group.

Interpretation

Simvastatin treatment for 5 years in a placebo-controlled trial, followed by open-label statin therapy, was associated with survival benefit over 10 years of follow-up compared with open-label statin therapy for the past 5 years only. No difference was noted in mortality from and incidence of cancer between the original simvastatin group and placebo group.

14.1 Clinical Studies in Adults

Reductions in Risk of CHD Mortality and Cardiovascular Events

In 4S, the effect of therapy with simvastatin on total mortality was assessed in 4,444 patients with CHD and baseline total cholesterol 212-309 mg/dL (5.5 to 8.0 mmol/L). In this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, patients were treated with standard care, including diet, and either simvastatin 20 to 40 mg/day (n=2,221) or placebo (n=2,223) for a median duration of 5.4 years. Over the course of the study, treatment with simvastatin led to mean reductions in total-C, LDL-C and TG of 25%, 35%, and 10%, respectively, and a mean increase in HDL-C of 8%. Simvastatin significantly reduced the risk of mortality by 30% (p=0.0003, 182 deaths in the simvastatin group vs 256 deaths in the placebo group). The risk of CHD mortality was significantly reduced by 42% (p=0.00001, 111 vs 189 deaths). There was no statistically significant difference between groups in non-cardiovascular mortality. Simvastatin significantly decreased the risk of having major coronary events (CHD mortality plus hospital-verified and silent non-fatal myocardial infarction [MI]) by 34% (p<0.00001, 431 vs 622 patients with one or more events). The risk of having a hospital-verified non-fatal MI was reduced by 37%. Simvastatin significantly reduced the risk for undergoing myocardial revascularization procedures (coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty) by 37% (p<0.00001, 252 vs 383 patients). Simvastatin significantly reduced the risk of fatal plus non-fatal cerebrovascular events (combined stroke and transient ischemic attacks) by 28% (p=0.033, 75 vs 102 patients). Simvastatin reduced the risk of major coronary events to a similar extent across the range of baseline total and LDL cholesterol levels. Because there were only 53 female deaths, the effect of simvastatin on mortality in women could not be adequately assessed. However, simvastatin significantly lessened the risk of having major coronary events by 34% (60 vs 91 women with one or more event). The randomization was stratified by angina alone (21% of each treatment group) or a previous MI. Because there were only 57 deaths among the patients with angina alone at baseline, the effect of simvastatin on mortality in this subgroup could not be adequately assessed. However, trends in reduced coronary mortality, major coronary events and revascularization procedures were consistent between this group and the total study cohort. Additionally, simvastatin resulted in similar decreases in relative risk for total mortality, CHD mortality, and major coronary events in elderly patients (≥65 years), compared with younger patients.

### Design and baseline characteristics of the incremental decrease in end points through aggressive lipid lowering study [^0f0eb489]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

The Incremental Decrease in End Points through Aggressive Lipid Lowering (IDEAL) study is an investigator-initiated trial designed to determine whether additional clinical benefit might be gained through a strategy that decreases levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels better than those currently achieved with established statin therapy in patients who have coronary heart disease. IDEAL is a multicenter prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded, end point classification study. Patients who had myocardial infarction were randomized to prescription treatment with 80 mg/day of atorvastatin or 20 mg/day of simvastatin (the dose was increased to 40 mg/day at week 24 in those patients whose plasma total cholesterol remained >5.0 mmol/L, or 190 mg/dl, or whose low-density lipoprotein cholesterol remained >3.0 mmol/L, or 115 mg/dl). The primary clinical outcome variable is the time to initial occurrence of a major coronary event, which is defined as nonfatal acute myocardial infarction, coronary death, or resuscitated cardiac arrest. The study is designed to have a power of 90% to detect a relative decrease of 20% in the atorvastatin-group compared with the simvastatin-group in the number of major events caused by coronary heart disease over approximately 5.5 years. The 8,888 randomized patients had the following characteristics: mean age 61.7 +/- 9.5 years, 19.1% women (mean age 64.0 +/- 9.5 years), baseline total cholesterol 5.1 +/- 1.0 mmol/L (197 mg/dl), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol 3.2 +/- 0.9 mmol/L (124 mg/dl), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol 1.2 +/- 0.3 mmol/L (46 mg/dl). Drug treatment before randomization consisted of statins in 77% of patients, aspirin in 78.9%, beta blockers in 75.1%, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in 30%.

### Reduction of cardiovascular events by simvastatin in nondiabetic coronary heart disease patients with and without the metabolic syndrome: subgroup analyses of the scandinavian simvastatin survival study (4S) [^a7d61c58]. Diabetes Care (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the effect of simvastatin treatment on the risk of cardiovascular events in nondiabetic patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) with and without the metabolic syndrome, as defined by the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP-III).

Research Design and Methods

Subgroup analyses were performed on data from 3933 nondiabetic patients with clinically established CHD, serum total cholesterol level 5.5-8.0 mmol/l, and serum triglyceride level <or=2.5 mmol/l who were participating in the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (4S), a randomized, placebo-controlled trial. End points were total mortality, coronary mortality, major CHD event, myocardial revascularization, any CHD event, stroke, and any atherosclerotic event.

Results

Over the 5.4-year median follow-up period, simvastatin produced similar changes in serum lipid levels in 893 patients with the metabolic syndrome and in 3040 patients without the metabolic syndrome. The relative risks of main end points in simvastatin-treated patients compared with placebo-treated patients with the metabolic syndrome were as follows: total mortality 0.54 (95% CI 0.36-0.82), coronary mortality 0.39 (0.23-0.65), major CHD event 0.59 (0.45-0.77), and any atherosclerotic event 0.69 (0.56-0.84). The corresponding RRs in patients without the metabolic syndrome were 0.72 (0.56-0.91), 0.62 (0.45-0.84), 0.71 (0.61-0.82), and 0.76 (0.68-0.85).

Conclusions

Nondiabetic CHD patients with or without the metabolic syndrome realize from simvastatin treatment a similar, substantial relative reduction in the risk of cardiovascular events. The absolute benefit may be greater in patients with the metabolic syndrome because they are at a higher absolute risk.

### Effect of simvastatin-ezetimibe compared with simvastatin monotherapy after acute coronary syndrome among patients 75 years or older: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^9bb72bd7]. JAMA Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Limited evidence is available regarding the benefit and hazard of higher-intensity treatment to lower lipid levels among patients 75 years or older. As a result, guideline recommendations differ for this age group compared with younger patients.

Objective

To determine the effect on outcomes and risks of combination ezetimibe and simvastatin compared with simvastatin monotherapy to lower lipid levels among patients 75 years or older with stabilized acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

Design, Setting, Participants

In this prespecified secondary analysis of the global, multicenter, prospective clinical randomized Improved Reduction of Outcomes: Vytorin Efficacy International Trial (IMPROVE-IT), outcomes and risks were compared by age among patients 50 years or older after a hospitalization for ACS. Data were collected from October 26, 2005, through July 8, 2010, with the database locked October 21, 2014. Data were analyzed May 29, 2015, through March 13, 2018, using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards models.

Interventions

Double-blind randomized assignment to combined simvastatin and ezetimibe or simvastatin and placebo with follow-up for a median of 6 years (interquartile range, 4.3-7.1 years).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary composite end point consisted of death due to cardiovascular disease, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, unstable angina requiring hospitalization, and coronary revascularization after 30 days. Individual adverse ischemic and safety end points and lipid variables were also analyzed.

Results

Of 18 144 patients enrolled (13 728 men [75.7%]; mean [SD] age, 64.1 [9.8] years), 5173 (28.5%) were 65 to 74 years old, and 2798 (15.4%) were 75 years or older at randomization. Treatment with simvastatin-ezetimibe resulted in lower rates of the primary end point than simvastatin-placebo, including 0.9% for patients younger than 65 years (HR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.90-1.05) and 0.8% for patients 65 to 74 years of age (hazard ratio [HR], 0.96; 95% CI, 0.87-1.06), with the greatest absolute risk reduction of 8.7% for patients 75 years or older (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.70-0.90) (P=.02 for interaction). The rate of adverse events did not increase with simvastatin-ezetimibe vs simvastatin-placebo among younger or older patients.

Conclusions and Relevance

In IMPROVE-IT, patients hospitalized for ACS derived benefit from higher-intensity therapy to lower lipid levels with simvastatin-ezetimibe compared with simvastatin monotherapy, with the greatest absolute risk reduction among patients 75 years or older. Addition of ezetimibe to simvastatin was not associated with any significant increase in safety issues among older patients. These results may have implications for guideline recommendations regarding lowering of lipid levels in the elderly.

### What is the role of intensive cholesterol lowering in the treatment of acute coronary syndromes? [^7e2be6de]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Cholesterol lowering with statins reduces coronary events in a primary-prevention setting and in patients with stable coronary disease. However, where the risk of a coronary event is highest, in the early months after an episode of unstable angina or non-Q-wave infarction, the effect of statin therapy has not been evaluated until recently. The lack of an early benefit in the 3 main statin trials in stable coronary disease may have discouraged this type of investigation. Yet, evidence suggests that intensive cholesterol lowering can rapidly influence several mechanisms intimately related to the pathogenesis of acute coronary syndromes; specifically, improvement in endothelial function, decreased propensity for platelet thrombus formation, and reduced inflammation. Furthermore, 3 nonrandomized, observational studies have recently reported an improved outcome in statin-treated compared with untreated patients after acute coronary syndromes.

### Should standard medical therapy for angina include a statin? [^3c65bc14]. Clinical Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

Although a wealth of evidence supports the use of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) in patients with clinically evident coronary artery disease, these agents are still underutilized. Statins are the most effective agents in reducing low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol among lipid-lowering drugs, and studies have recently shown that they improve endothelial function and plaque stabilization, and induce regression of atherosclerotic lesions. This article reviews the most recent evidence and guideline recommendations supporting the use of statins in chronic stable angina pectoris and acute coronary syndromes.

### Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol targeting with pitavastatin + ezetimibe for patients with acute coronary syndrome and dyslipidaemia: the HIJ-PROPER study, a prospective, open-label, randomized trial [^338e8fe0]. European Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Serum cholesterol concentration is determined both by endogenous cholesterol from hepatic and extrahepatic synthesis and by exogenous cholesterol from intestinal absorption of dietary and biliary cholesterol.Statins produce beneficial effects by inhibiting hepatic cholesterol synthesis but do not directly affect intestinal absorption. Subgroup analysis in a Scandinavian simvastatin survival study (4S)suggested that patients with high baseline synthesis of cholesterol seemed to respond to statin treatment, while those with low cholesterol synthesis were non-responders. In the present study, intensive lipid lowering with ezetimibe was associated with a significant reduction of primary endpoint events in patients with increased cholesterol absorption as expressed through higher baseline sitosterol. Further investigation is needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of statin plus ezetimibe in ACS patients with high baseline cholesterol absorption.

A recently published analysis and meta-analysis of data from the Minnesota Coronary Experiment indicate that drastic changes in eating habits led to significant lowering of serum cholesterol. However, these cholesterol-lowering interventions were not associated with benefits in mortality from coronary heart disease or in all-cause mortality.A recent cohort study also demonstrated that statin-taking coronary heart disease patients with LDL-C 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L)–100 mg/dL (2.6 mmol/L) had a lower risk of adverse cardiac outcomes than those with LDL-C between 100 mg/dL (2.6 mmol/L) and 130 mg/dL (3.4 mmol/L), but no additional benefit was gained by achieving LDL-C of 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L) or less.Although the results of the present study are consistent with these two studies, expectations based on CTT analysiscontinue to be widely emphasized. PCSK9 inhibitors induce a marked lowering of LDL-C,but no data are yet available on their effects on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Data from an ongoing trialto evaluate the effects of PCSK9 inhibitors on cardiovascular outcomes may provide a breakthrough in the therapeutic limits for high-risk patients with atherosclerotic disease.

### Transiently achieved very low LDL-cholesterol levels by statin and alirocumab after acute coronary syndrome are associated with cardiovascular risk reduction: the ODYSSEY OUTCOMES trial [^c43eafbb]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical legacy effects of statinsand evolocumabhave been demonstrated after extended treatment periods. For example, in the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (4S), total and coronary mortality were reduced by simvastatin vs. placebo during 5 years of randomized treatment, and that benefit was maintained during 5 additional years of observation when most patients from both groups received open-label simvastatin.In the West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study (WOSCOPS), total and coronary mortality was reduced by pravastatin compared with placebo during 5 years of randomized treatment, and the benefit remained evident for up to 15 years of extended follow-up even though statin treatment was employed in fewer than 40% of patients from either original treatment group.In a 5-year open-label extension of the FOURIER trial, which comprised approximately 24% of its initial cohort, those originally assigned to receive evolocumab demonstrated sustained, very low levels of LDL-C and a lower long-term risk of MACE and cardiovascular death than that of those initially assigned to placebo.However, none of these analyses define whether a legacy effect ensues after a short period of very high-intensity cholesterol-lowering therapy resulting in very low LDL-C levels.

### Early intensive vs a delayed conservative simvastatin strategy in patients with acute coronary syndromes: phase Z of the A to Z trial [^f5ddc2e3]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Context

Limited data are available evaluating how the timing and intensity of statin therapy following an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) event affect clinical outcome.

Objective

To compare early initiation of an intensive statin regimen with delayed initiation of a less intensive regimen in patients with ACS.

Design, Setting, and Participants

International, randomized, double-blind trial of patients with ACS receiving 40 mg/d of simvastatin for 1 month followed by 80 mg/d thereafter (n = 2265) compared with ACS patients receiving placebo for 4 months followed by 20 mg/d of simvastatin (n = 2232), who were enrolled in phase Z of the A to Z trial between December 29, 1999, and January 6, 2003.

Main Outcome Measure

The primary end point was a composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, readmission for ACS, and stroke. Follow-up was for at least 6 months and up to 24 months.

Results

Among the patients in the placebo plus simvastatin group, the median low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level achieved while taking placebo was 122 mg/dL (3.16 mmol/L) at 1 month and was 77 mg/dL (1.99 mmol/L) at 8 months while taking 20 mg/d of simvastatin. Among the patients in the simvastatin only group, the median LDL cholesterol level achieved at 1 month while taking 40 mg/d of simvastatin was 68 mg/dL (1.76 mmol/L) and was 63 mg/dL (1.63 mmol/L) at 8 months while taking 80 mg/d of simvastatin. A total of 343 patients (16.7%) in the placebo plus simvastatin group experienced the primary end point compared with 309 (14.4%) in the simvastatin only group (40 mg/80 mg) (hazard ratio [HR], 0.89; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.76-1.04; P =.14). Cardiovascular death occurred in 109 (5.4%) and 83 (4.1%) patients in the 2 groups (HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.57-1.00; P =.05) but no differences were observed in other individual components of the primary end point. No difference was evident during the first 4 months between the groups for the primary end point (HR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.83-1.25; P =.89), but from 4 months through the end of the study the primary end point was significantly reduced in the simvastatin only group (HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.60-0.95; P =.02). Myopathy (creatine kinase >10 times the upper limit of normal associated with muscle symptoms) occurred in 9 patients (0.4%) receiving simvastatin 80 mg/d, in no patients receiving lower doses of simvastatin, and in 1 patient receiving placebo (P =.02).

Conclusions

The trial did not achieve the prespecified end point. However, among patients with ACS, the early initiation of an aggressive simvastatin regimen resulted in a favorable trend toward reduction of major cardiovascular events.

### Role of apolipoprotein B in the clinical management of cardiovascular risk in adults: an expert clinical consensus from the National Lipid Association [^cd50b1fd]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2024). High credibility.

Statin monotherapy—trial data indicate that in the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (4S) secondary prevention cohort with total cholesterol at entry = 213–310 mg/dL, a 1% reduction resulted in a decrease of major coronary events of 1.7% for LDL-C, 1.7% for non-HDL-C, and 1.1% for apoB; in IDEAL, both non-HDL-C and apoB changes were better predictors than LDL-C, with a one standard deviation change associated with relative risk reductions of 14.1% and 14.3%, respectively, compared to 11.8% for LDL-C; and using combined Treating to New Targets (TNT) and IDEAL data, non-HDL-C had hazard ratio [HR]: 1.19; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.14–1.25 for major cardiovascular events (MACE).

### Influence of low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and elevated triglyceride on coronary heart disease events and response to simvastatin therapy in 4S [^06a03af2]. Circulation (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with low HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) and elevated triglyceride had an increased risk for coronary heart disease (CHD) events and received the greatest benefit with fibrate therapy in substudy analyses of the Helsinki Heart Study and the Bezafibrate Infarction Prevention Study.

Methods and Results

In this post hoc analysis of the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study, which enrolled patients with elevated LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) and CHD, subgroups defined by HDL-C and triglyceride quartiles were compared to examine the influence of HDL-C and triglyceride on CHD events and response to therapy. Patients in the lowest HDL-C (<1.00 mmol/L [39 mg/dL]) and highest triglyceride (>1.80 mmol/L [159 mg/dL]) quartiles (lipid triad; n=458) had increased proportions of other features of the metabolic syndrome (increased body mass index, hypertension, diabetes), men, prior myocardial infarction, prior revascularization, and beta-blocker use than patients in the highest HDL-C (>1.34 mmol/L [52 mg/dL]) and lowest triglyceride (<1.11 mmol/L [98 mg/dL]) quartiles (isolated LDL-C elevation; n=545). The major coronary event rate was highest in lipid triad patients on placebo (35.9%), and this subgroup had the greatest event reduction (relative risk 0.48, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.69); a significant treatment-by-subgroup interaction (P=0.03) indicated a greater treatment effect in the lipid triad subgroup than the isolated LDL-C elevation subgroup.

Conclusions

Patients with elevated LDL-C, low HDL-C, and elevated triglycerides were more likely than patients with isolated LDL-C elevation to have other characteristics of the metabolic syndrome, had increased risk for CHD events on placebo, and received greater benefit with simvastatin therapy.

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

In the pre-marketing controlled clinical studies and their open extensions (2,423 patients with median duration of follow-up of approximately 18 months), 1.4% of patients were discontinued due to adverse reactions. The most common adverse reactions that led to treatment discontinuation were: gastrointestinal disorders (0.5%), myalgia (0.1%), and arthralgia (0.1%). The most commonly reported adverse reactions (incidence ≥5%) in simvastatin controlled clinical trials were: upper respiratory infections (9.0%), headache (7.4%), abdominal pain (7.3%), constipation (6.6%), and nausea (5.4%).

Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study

In 4S involving 4,444 (age range 35-71 years, 19% women, 100% Caucasians) treated with 20-40 mg/day of simvastatin (n=2,221) or placebo (n=2,223) over a median of 5.4 years, adverse reactions reported in ≥2% of patients and at a rate greater than placebo are shown in Table 2 .

### Long-term effectiveness and safety of pravastatin in 9014 patients with coronary heart disease and average cholesterol concentrations: the LIPID trial follow-up [^3764b1cd]. Lancet (2002). Excellent credibility.

Background

The Long-term Intervention with Pravastatin in Ischaemic Disease (LIPID) study showed that pravastatin therapy over 6 years reduced mortality and cardiovascular events in patients with previous acute coronary syndromes and average cholesterol concentrations. We assessed the longer-term effects of initial treatment with pravastatin on further cardiovascular events and mortality over a total follow-up period of 8 years.

Methods

In the main trial, 9014 patients with previous myocardial infarction or unstable angina and a baseline plasma cholesterol concentration of 4.0-7.0 mmol/L were randomly assigned pravastatin 40 mg daily or placebo and followed up for 6 years. Subsequently, all patients were offered open-label pravastatin for 2 more years. Major cardiovascular events and adverse events were compared according to initial treatment assignment.

Findings

7680 (97% of those still alive) had 2 years of extended follow-up. 3766 (86%) of those assigned placebo and 3914 (88%) assigned pravastatin agreed to take open-label pravastatin. During this period, patients originally assigned pravastatin had almost identical cholesterol concentrations to those assigned placebo, but a lower risk of death from all causes (219 [5.6%] vs 255 [6.8%], p=0.029), coronary heart disease (CHD) death (108 [2.8%] vs 137 [3.6%], p=0.026), and CHD death or non-fatal myocardial infarction (176 [4.5%] vs 196 [5.2%], p=0.08). Over the total 8-year period, all-cause mortality was 888 (19.7%) in the group originally assigned placebo and 717 (15.9%) in the group originally assigned pravastatin, CHD mortality was 510 (11.3%) versus 395 (8.8%), myocardial infarction was 570 (12.7%) versus 435 (9.6%; each p < 0.0001), and stroke was 272 (6.0%) versus 224 (5.0%; p=0.015). Stronger evidence of separate treatment benefits than in the main trial was seen in important prespecified subgroups (women, patients aged > or = 70 years, and those with total cholesterol < 5.5 mmol/L). Pravastatin had no significant adverse effects.

Interpretation

The evidence of sustained treatment benefits and safety of long-term pravastatin treatment reinforces the importance of long-term cholesterol-lowering treatment for almost all patients with previous CHD events.

### The benefits of statin therapy – what questions remain? [^9377ece8]. Clinical Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

Early hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin) trials provided the first evidence of the benefits of statin therapy in secondary prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD). Outcomes data from more recent trials involving atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin, have since expanded the patient population shown to benefit from statin therapy. Current studies are evaluating the benefits of lowering lipid levels with statins to below current goals, as well as examining benefits in special patient populations and evaluating the value of surrogate markers of CHD. Early trials provided a solid foundation of knowledge on the efficacy and safety of statins. Recent and ongoing trials generate new data to resolve remaining questions in the fields of CHD prevention and lipidology.

### Ezetimibe added to statin therapy after acute coronary syndromes [^427f6815]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2015). Excellent credibility.

Ezetimibe added to simvastatin after acute coronary syndromes—double-blind randomized evidence shows incremental LDL lowering and modest clinical benefit. A double-blind, randomized trial involved 18,144 patients hospitalized for an acute coronary syndrome within the preceding 10 days with LDL cholesterol 50 to 100 mg per deciliter (1.3 to 2.6 mmol per liter) on lipid-lowering therapy or 50 to 125 mg per deciliter (1.3 to 3.2 mmol per liter) if not; simvastatin (40 mg) plus ezetimibe (10 mg) (simvastatin–ezetimibe) was compared with simvastatin (40 mg) plus placebo, using a composite primary end point of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, unstable angina requiring rehospitalization, coronary revascularization (≥30 days after randomization), or nonfatal stroke, with median follow-up 6 years. Median time-weighted average LDL cholesterol during the study was 53.7 mg per deciliter (1.4 mmol per liter) with simvastatin–ezetimibe versus 69.5 mg per deciliter (1.8 mmol per liter) with simvastatin alone (P<0.001). The Kaplan–Meier primary end point rate at 7 years was 32.7% with simvastatin–ezetimibe versus 34.7% with simvastatin alone (absolute risk difference, 2.0 percentage points; hazard ratio, 0.936; 95% confidence interval, 0.89 to 0.99; P=0.016), and rates of myopathy, rhabdomyolysis, gallbladder, and hepatic adverse effects and cancer were similar in the two groups. The authors conclude that when added to statin therapy, ezetimibe resulted in incremental lowering of LDL cholesterol levels and improved cardiovascular outcomes; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00202878.

### Intensive lowering of LDL cholesterol with 80 mg versus 20 mg simvastatin daily in 12, 064 survivors of myocardial infarction: a double-blind randomised trial [^f5412f0d]. Lancet (2010). Excellent credibility.

Background

Lowering of LDL cholesterol reduces major vascular events, but whether more intensive therapy safely produces extra benefits is uncertain. We aimed to establish efficacy and safety of more intensive statin treatment in patients at high cardiovascular risk.

Methods

We undertook a double-blind randomised trial in 12,064 men and women aged 18-80 years with a history of myocardial infarction. Participants were either currently on or had clear indication for statin therapy, and had a total cholesterol concentration of at least 3·5 mmol/L if already on a statin or 4·5 mmol/L if not. Randomisation to either 80 mg or 20 mg simvastatin daily was done centrally using a minimisation algorithm. Participants were assessed at 2, 4, 8, and 12 months after randomisation and then every 6 months until final follow-up. The primary endpoint was major vascular events, defined as coronary death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or arterial revascularisation. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered, number ISRCTN74348595.

Findings

6031 participants were allocated 80 mg simvastatin daily, and 6033 allocated 20 mg simvastatin daily. During a mean follow-up of 6·7 (SD 1·5) years, allocation to 80 mg simvastatin produced an average 0·35 (SE 0·01) mmol/L greater reduction in LDL cholesterol compared with allocation to 20 mg. Major vascular events occurred in 1477 (24·5%) participants allocated 80 mg simvastatin versus 1553 (25·7%) of those allocated 20 mg, corresponding to a 6% proportional reduction (risk ratio 0·94, 95% CI 0·88-1·01; p=0·10). There were no apparent differences in numbers of haemorrhagic strokes (24 [0·4%] vs 25 [0·4%]) or deaths attributed to vascular (565 [9·4%] vs 572 [9·5%]) or non-vascular (399 [6·6%] vs 398 [6·6%]) causes. Compared with two (0·03%) cases of myopathy in patients taking 20 mg simvastatin daily, there were 53 (0·9%) cases in the 80 mg group.

Interpretation

The 6% (SE 3·5%) reduction in major vascular events with a further 0·35 mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol in our trial is consistent with previous trials. Myopathy was increased with 80 mg simvastatin daily, but intensive lowering of LDL cholesterol can be achieved safely with other regimens.

### Clinician's guide to the updated ABCs of cardiovascular disease prevention [^d8cd1de0]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Both atherogenic dyslipidemia and lipoprotein(a) abnormalities contribute to residual ASCVD risk in patients with well‐controlled LDL‐C. Consistent with international guidelines, – checking for elevated apolipoprotein B and lipoprotein(a) levels as an adjunct to the lipid panel can further risk‐stratify patients and potentially justify intensifying statin therapy. Owing to synergistic effects when LDL‐C levels are elevated,especially in those with personal or family histories of premature ASCVD, patients may benefit from more intensive statin therapy and lifestyle interventions.At the present time, use of interventions to lower lipoprotein(a) directly has not yet been proven to reduce ASCVD risk.

Statins

The hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors are the most widely studied lipid‐lowering agents. Strong evidence supports their use as first‐line agents in high‐risk groupsand in primary prevention when lifestyle interventions alone are inadequate to reduce ASCVD risk sufficiently. A wealth of accumulated data support the consideration of statins in primary prevention in those with elevated cholesterol levels along with another CHD risk factor. – Data from the JUPITER trial also demonstrated the benefit from statin treatment in patients with “normal” cholesterol levels but elevated high sensitivity‐C reactive protein levels.

Statin use in secondary prevention is also essential for reducing CHD risk. The Heart Protection Study (HPS) demonstrated 13% relative risk reduction in total mortality over a mean of 5.5 years when patients with increased CVD risk were treated with simvastatin 40 mg/d, regardless of baseline LDL‐C levels.Multiple secondary prevention trials have demonstrated benefit from the use of statins after acute coronary syndrome (MIRACL [Effects Of Atorvastatin On Early Recurrent Ischemic Events In Acute Coronary Syndromes. The Miracl Study: A Randomized Controlled Trial], Pravastatin or Atorvastatin Evaluation and Infection Therapy‐Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 22 [PROVE IT‐TIMI 22], Aggrastat To Zocor [A to Z]) – and in patients with stable CHD (4S [Scandanavian Simvastatin Survival Study], Treating to New Targets [TNT], The Incremental Decrease in End Points through Aggressive Lipid Lowering [IDEAL]). – A robust dose‐dependent relationship between the degree to which LDL‐C is lowered and the relative reduction of CHD events, independent of baseline patient risk, has been noted across these trials.

### Ezetimibe added to statin therapy after acute coronary syndromes [^c89f866c]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2015). Excellent credibility.

Ezetimibe and statin after acute coronary syndromes—procedures and dosing specified that blood samples were obtained at randomization, at 1, 4, 8, and 12 months, and yearly thereafter; for low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels higher than 79 mg per deciliter (2.0 mmol per liter) on two consecutive measurements, the simvastatin dose was increased to 80 mg in a double-blind manner; in June 2011 patients were no longer eligible for an increased dose of simvastatin to 80 mg and any patient who had been receiving the 80-mg dose for less than 1 year had the dose reduced to 40 mg; if an LDL measurement on the new regimen was confirmed to be higher than 100 mg per deciliter, the study drug could be discontinued and more potent therapy initiated; follow-up continued for a minimum of 2.5 years and until the target number of events (5250) was reached.

### Cardiovascular outcome studies in diabetes: how Do we make sense of these new data? [^3af01efb]. Diabetes Therapy (2016). Low credibility.

What Causes the Disconnect Between the Early Clinical Work and the Randomized Controlled Trials?

There has been much deliberation as to why the potential benefit promised in the pre-clinical and early clinical work has not been realized in the definitive randomized controlled trials. One hypothesis explores the possibility that this may be simply due to the duration of the studies. Indeed, if the heart protection study (HPS) or the Scandinavian simvastatin survival study (4S) had been censored at 18 months or 2 years they would have not demonstrated any benefit from simvastatin, yet statin therapy is widely accepted as a core element of cardiovascular risk reduction. If this is the case, studies such as the liraglutide effect and action in diabetes: evaluation of cardiovascular outcome results (LEADER, ClinicalTrials.gov identifier, NCT01179048) and the cardiovascular outcome trial of linagliptin versus glimepiride in type 2 diabetes (CAROLINA, ClinicalTrials.gov identifier, NCT01243424) trials that have a study minimum duration of 3.5 years (the point at which the HPS curves were clearly diverged) should show benefit. The reduction in cardiovascular events suggested by the early meta-analyses, however, was present in studies with a mean duration of 44.1 weeks. Thus, duration of exposure to agents may not be the only factor.

### The effects of cholesterol lowering with simvastatin on cause-specific mortality and on cancer incidence in 20, 536 high-risk people: a randomised placebo-controlled trial [ ISRCTN48489393 ] [^1baf6318]. BMC Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Any adverse effects of lowering cholesterol might be expected to emerge only after some years of lower cholesterol levels, but there was no suggestion of an excess of non-vascular death even during the later years of the study (figures 2 and 4). For example, there were similar rates of non-vascular death in each treatment group during years 3 & 4 (RR 0.97 [0.81–1.17]; p = 0.8) and during years 5+ (RR 0.93 [0.77–1.13]; p = 0.5). Nor did lowering total cholesterol by an average of about 1.2 mmol/L for 5 years produce an excess of non-vascular mortality in any of the different types of patient studied (figure 7). For example, inverse associations between cholesterol concentrations and mortality have been reported from some observational studies among the very elderly. But no adverse effect on non-vascular mortality was seen among the 5806 participants in HPS who were aged 70 years or older at entry (RR 0.95 [0.80–1.13]; p = 0.6) or, indeed, even among the 1263 participants who were aged 75–80 years at entry (60 [9.8%] vs 78 [12.0%]; RR 0.78 [0.56–1.09]; p = 0.1). Similarly, despite concerns from non-randomised observational studies about higher mortality in association with low cholesterol concentrations, there was no adverse effect on non-vascular mortality even among the 4072 participants with pretreatment total cholesterol measurements below 5.0 mmol/L (RR 0.99 [0.77–1.26]; p = 0.9), in whom simvastatin allocation reduced total cholesterol concentrations to an average of 3.5 mmol/L (Table 1).

### In-hospital initiation of statin therapy in acute coronary syndromes: maximizing the early and long-term benefits [^27f19927]. Chest (2005). Low credibility.

Patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) are at high risk for recurrent coronary events, sudden death, and all-cause mortality. Conventional revascularization therapies reduce the risk of further ischemia but do not affect the underlying atherosclerotic disease. Statins have a proven record in the secondary prevention of coronary heart disease. Furthermore, statins have been shown to exert varying degrees of pleiotropic effects, which may stabilize vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques. A compelling body of evidence from randomized controlled trials demonstrates that high-dose, potent statin therapy initiated immediately after an acute coronary event can significantly reduce early as well as longer-term morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, high-dose, potent statin therapy displays a reasonable safety profile. National guidelines now recommend that in patients with ACS, statin therapy should be initiated in hospital prior to discharge, irrespective of baseline low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, to improve clinical outcomes. Every effort should be made to ensure all eligible patients with ACS are initiated and maintained on statin therapy.

### Should all diabetic patients be treated with a statin? [^59ccbba4]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

SECONDARY PREVENTION AND MIXED SECONDARY AND PRIMARY PREVENTION TRIAL

In a post hoc analysis of the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (4S), a significant reduction in major coronary events and revascularization was observed in simvastatin-treated diabetic patients (Table 1). Total and coronary mortality were also reduced, but not significantly, because of the small sample size. Notably, risk reduction for major coronary events was greater in diabetic (42%) than in nondiabetic patients (32%). In the Cholesterol and Recurrent Events (CARE) trial, pravastatin treatment, compared with placebo, reduced by 25% the relative risk of coronary events for both diabetic and nondiabetic patients. In the Long-Term Intervention with Pravastatin in Ischemic Disease (LIPID) trial, treatment with pravastatin was associated with a reduction of 19% in major CHD (albeit not statistically significant). A possible explanation for the nonsignificant reduction may be the lower baseline risk: diabetic patients treated with placebo in the LIPID trial had a 15.9% chance of fatal CHD and nonfatal MI compared with a likelihood of >20% in CARE and ∼35% in 4S. The Heart Protection Study (HPS), the largest statin trial, comprised almost 6,000 diabetic patients. For the first occurrence of major vascular events among participants with diabetes, there was a statistically significant 22% reduction in the event rate, which was similar to that among the other high-risk individuals studied. The Atorvastatin Study for Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease End Points (ASPEN) trial examined the effect of 10 mg atorvastatin versus placebo on major cardiovascular events in 2,410 subjects with diabetes. This trial was originally designed as a secondary prevention trial for individuals with CHD. However, the protocol was amended within 2 years of initiation of the study to enable enrollment of subjects without prior CHD. Subsequent treatment guidelines necessitated all secondary prevention subjects, and primary prevention subjects who developed a primary CVD end point during the trial, to discontinue the study medication and commence active therapy. In this trial, there was no difference in major cardiovascular events between the atorvastatin and placebo groups. In the Diabetes and Dialysis Study, 1,255 patients with diabetes receiving hemodialysis (30% of whom had CHD), were randomly assigned to receive 20 mg atorvastatin per day or placebo. Atorvastatin had no significant effect on the composite primary end point of cardiovascular death, nonfatal MI, and stroke. These results were observed despite a high incidence rate of major cardiovascular events, which was the highest in all long-term prospective statin therapy trials. It is noteworthy that the subgroup analyses showed no difference in outcomes for baseline LDL cholesterol level, or presence or absence of CVD. A possible explanation for the lack of benefit from statin therapy in this trial may be due to the type of patients studied. In patients on dialysis, other pathogenetic factors may be more prominent in contributing to cardiovascular risk. It is of interest that, in patients with end-stage renal disease, there is a kind of “reverse epidemiology,” with inverse associations between blood cholesterol (as well as other risk factors including hypertension and obesity) and all-cause or cardiovascular mortality.

### Effects on 11-year mortality and morbidity of lowering LDL cholesterol with simvastatin for about 5 years in 20, 536 high-risk individuals: a randomised controlled trial [^a0993ed4]. Lancet (2011). Excellent credibility.

Background

Findings of large randomised trials have shown that lowering LDL cholesterol with statins reduces vascular morbidity and mortality rapidly, but limited evidence exists about the long-term efficacy and safety of statin treatment. The aim of the extended follow-up of the Heart Protection Study (HPS) is to assess long-term efficacy and safety of lowering LDL cholesterol with statins, and here we report cause-specific mortality and major morbidity in the in-trial and post-trial periods.

Methods

20,536 patients at high risk of vascular and non-vascular outcomes were allocated either 40 mg simvastatin daily or placebo, using minimised randomisation. Mean in-trial follow-up was 5·3 years (SD 1·2), and post-trial follow-up of surviving patients yielded a mean total duration of 11·0 years (SD 0·6). The primary outcome of the long-term follow-up of HPS was first post-randomisation major vascular event, and analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ISRCTN, number 48489393.

Findings

During the in-trial period, allocation to simvastatin yielded an average reduction in LDL cholesterol of 1·0 mmol/L and a proportional decrease in major vascular events of 23% (95% CI 19-28; p<0·0001), with significant divergence each year after the first. During the post-trial period (when statin use and lipid concentrations were similar in both groups), no further significant reductions were noted in either major vascular events (risk ratio [RR] 0·95 [0·89-1·02]) or vascular mortality (0·98 [0·90-1·07]). During the combined in-trial and post-trial periods, no significant differences were recorded in cancer incidence at all sites (0·98 [0·92-1·05]) or any particular site, or in mortality attributed to cancer (1·01 [0·92-1·11]) or to non-vascular causes (0·96 [0·89-1·03]).

Interpretation

More prolonged LDL-lowering statin treatment produces larger absolute reductions in vascular events. Moreover, even after study treatment stopped in HPS, benefits persisted for at least 5 years without any evidence of emerging hazards. These findings provide further support for the prompt initiation and long-term continuation of statin treatment.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^0391e9c4]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Cholesterol absorption inhibitor—acute coronary syndrome (IMPROVE-IT): In 18,144 patients (approximately 24% women) with acute coronary syndrome <10 days, randomized to simvastatin 40 mg daily plus ezetimibe 10 mg or placebo, the primary composite outcome was cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction (MI), hospital admission for unstable angina, coronary revascularization (≥30 days after randomization), or stroke; combination therapy achieved a statistically significant 10% relative reduction versus simvastatin alone (HR 0.90; 95% CI 0.84–0.97; P = .003). Gender was pre-specified for subgroup analysis; women trended toward greater benefit without CIs crossing unity, whereas men’s CIs crossed unity, and this interaction did not achieve statistical significance.

ACC/AHA cholesterol guideline recommendations for clinical ASCVD state that “High-intensity statin therapy should be initiated or continued as first-line therapy in women and men ≤75 years of age who have clinical ASCVD*, unless contraindicated.” (Class I; Level of Evidence: A). If high-intensity therapy “is contraindicated† or when characteristics predisposing to statin-associated adverse effects are present, moderate-intensity statin should be used as the second option if tolerated.” (Class I; Level of Evidence: A). For individuals with clinical ASCVD “>75 years of age, it is reasonable to evaluate the potential for ASCVD risk-reduction benefits and for adverse effects, drug–drug interactions and to consider patient preferences, when initiating a moderate- or high-intensity statin. It is reasonable to continue statin therapy in those who are tolerating it.” (Class IIa; Level of Evidence: A). The document defines clinical ASCVD as “Clinical ASCVD includes acute coronary syndromes, a history of MI, stable or unstable angina, coronary or other arterial revascularization, stroke, TIA, and peripheral arterial disease presumed to be of atherosclerotic origin.”

Compliance and effects on blood lipids

The mean duration of follow-up was 5.0 years for all randomised participants: 5.3 years for those who survived to the scheduled end of study treatment and about half that for those who did not (yielding 51,121 person years of follow-up for all those allocated simvastatin and 50,664 for all those allocated placebo). Compliance at each follow-up was defined as at least 80% of the scheduled simvastatin or placebo tablets having been taken since the previous follow-up. Among the participants allocated 40 mg simvastatin daily, average statin use during the scheduled treatment period was 85% (with 82% compliant with their allocated simvastatin, 3% on non-study statin alone and 2% on both). By contrast, among those allocated placebo, 4% at the end of the first year of follow-up, but 32% at the end of the fifth year, were taking non-study statin therapy, yielding an average of 17%. Non-study statin use in the placebo group was more common among those who already had diagnosed coronary disease at entry, were younger or had higher pretreatment total or LDL cholesterol concentrations. In each subcategory studied, however, the average difference in total cholesterol was about 1.2 mmol/L (range: 1.1–1.3 mmol/L: table 1) and in LDL cholesterol was about 1.0 mmol/L (range: 0.9–1.1 mmol/L). In particular, among the 4072 participants whose pretreatment measurements of total cholesterol were below 5.0 mmol/L (193 mg/dL), the average total cholesterol concentration during the trial was 3.5 mmol/L in the simvastatin group compared to 4.6 mmol/L in the placebo group.

* Intention-to-treat comparisons with missing data imputed from initial pre-treatment screening values. The absolute difference in LDL-cholesterol that would be produced by full compliance with 40 mg simvastatin daily can be estimated as the ratio of the absolute difference to the estimated compliance. For example, -1.0/67% = -1.5 mmol/L.

### Pharmacologic options for aggressive low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering: benefits versus risks [^c9431065]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

Lessons from recent end point trials of lipid-lowering drugs indicate that patients at very high risk for coronary artery disease (CAD) benefit from treatment that lowers low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol plasma levels to < or = 1.81 mmol/L (< or = 70 mg/dL), that patients with > or = 2 risk factors benefit from treatment that lowers plasma LDL cholesterol to <2.59 mmol/L (<100 mg/dL), and that a significant reduction in CAD event rates is most often associated with a minimum plasma LDL cholesterol reduction of 30%. Recently, the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults (Adult Treatment Panel III) recommendations were amended to incorporate these lessons. To reach these more aggressive goals and plasma LDL cholesterol reductions, more aggressive therapies will be required. The best way to implement more aggressive therapy is to start with one of the more potent statins, especially atorvastatin or rosuvastatin, or higher doses of other statins. This approach alone is likely to achieve treatment goals in 50% to 80% of patients. For patients needing additional plasma LDL cholesterol lowering, combination therapies will be required. Adding colesevelam, ezetimibe, or niacin to a stable statin regimen will generally provide an additional 10% to 15% lowering of plasma LDL cholesterol. These more potent statins, even when used in higher doses, appear to be safe. The incidence of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis, as documented in long-term clinical trials, is <0.1% and <0.01%, respectively, except for simvastatin, which has a higher incidence of these problems. Less information is available about the safety of lowering levels of plasma LDL cholesterol to < or = 1.81 mmol/L (< or = 70 mg/dL), but an analysis of a recent 2-year-long clinical trial, in which patients had on-treatment plasma LDL cholesterol levels as low as 0.67 mmol/L (26 mg/dL), reported no signals of untoward effects in patients with progressively lower levels.

### High-dose atorvastatin vs usual-dose simvastatin for secondary prevention after myocardial infarction: the IDEAL study: a randomized controlled trial [^afa873a5]. JAMA (2005). Excellent credibility.

Context

Evidence suggests that more intensive lowering of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) than is commonly applied clinically will provide further benefit in stable coronary artery disease.

Objective

To compare the effects of 2 strategies of lipid lowering on the risk of cardiovascular disease among patients with a previous myocardial infarction (MI).

Design, Setting, and Participants

The IDEAL study, a prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded end-point evaluation trial conducted at 190 ambulatory cardiology care and specialist practices in northern Europe between March 1999 and March 2005 with a median follow-up of 4.8 years, which enrolled 8888 patients aged 80 years or younger with a history of acute MI.

Interventions

Patients were randomly assigned to receive a high dose of atorvastatin (80 mg/d; n = 4439), or usual-dose simvastatin (20 mg/d; n = 4449).

Main Outcome Measure

Occurrence of a major coronary event, defined as coronary death, confirmed nonfatal acute MI, or cardiac arrest with resuscitation.

Results

During treatment, mean LDL-C levels were 104 (SE, 0.3) mg/dL in the simvastatin group and 81 (SE, 0.3) mg/dL in the atorvastatin group. A major coronary event occurred in 463 simvastatin patients (10.4%) and in 411 atorvastatin patients (9.3%) (hazard ratio [HR], 0.89; 95% CI, 0.78-1.01; P = .07). Nonfatal acute MI occurred in 321 (7.2%) and 267 (6.0%) in the 2 groups (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.71-0.98; P = .02), but no differences were seen in the 2 other components of the primary end point. Major cardiovascular events occurred in 608 and 533 in the 2 groups, respectively (HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.77-0.98; P = .02). Occurrence of any coronary event was reported in 1059 simvastatin and 898 atorvastatin patients (HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.76-0.91; P<.001). Noncardiovascular death occurred in 156 (3.5%) and 143 (3.2%) in the 2 groups (HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.73-1.15; P = .47). Death from any cause occurred in 374 (8.4%) in the simvastatin group and 366 (8.2%) in the atorvastatin group (HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.85-1.13; P = .81). Patients in the atorvastatin group had higher rates of drug discontinuation due to nonserious adverse events; transaminase elevation resulted in 43 (1.0%) vs 5 (0.1%) withdrawals (P<.001). Serious myopathy and rhabdomyolysis were rare in both groups.

Conclusions

In this study of patients with previous MI, intensive lowering of LDL-C did not result in a significant reduction in the primary outcome of major coronary events, but did reduce the risk of other composite secondary end points and nonfatal acute MI. There were no differences in cardiovascular or all-cause mortality. Patients with MI may benefit from intensive lowering of LDL-C without an increase in noncardiovascular mortality or other serious adverse reactions.Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00159835.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 1 – full report [^2e7d6864]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Ezetimibe add-on therapy after acute coronary syndromes—Ezetimibe has been shown to produce significant additional improvements in LDL-C levels and goal attainment when added to statin therapy, and in IMPROVE-IT (18,444 patients) 7-year event rates were 32.7% with ezetimibe plus simvastatin versus 34.7% with simvastatin alone (hazard ratio, 0.936; confidence interval, 0.887-0.988). Median LDL-C levels at 1 year were 53.2 mg/dL with ezetimibe plus simvastatin vs 69.9 mg/dL with simvastatin alone. According to the reported relationship of a 22% reduction in major vascular events per 1 mmol/L LDL-C reduction from statin therapies, the predicted reduction with combination therapy would be 9.5%, which is nearly identical to the reported reduction of 10.6%, and the number needed to treat for prevention of the primary end point was 50 using 7-year event rates.

### The metabolic syndrome and risk of major coronary events in the scandinavian simvastatin survival study (4S) and the air force / Texas coronary atherosclerosis prevention study (AFCAPS / texCAPS) [^8703104c]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

The metabolic syndrome, which is a set of lipid and nonlipid risk factors of metabolic origin linked with insulin resistance, is believed to be associated with an elevated risk for cardiovascular disease, but few have studied this association in prospective long-term cardiovascular outcomes trials. Placebo data from the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (4S) and the Air Force/Texas Coronary Atherosclerosis Prevention Study (AFCAPS/TexCAPS) were used post hoc to estimate the long-term relative risk of major coronary events (MCEs) associated with the metabolic syndrome, after excluding diabetes mellitus. In 4S and AFCAPS/TexCAPS, respectively, placebo-treated patients with the metabolic syndrome were 1.5 (95% confidence interval 1.2 to 1.8) and 1.4 (95% confidence interval 1.04 to 1.9) times more likely to have MCEs than those without it. Of the components of the metabolic syndrome, low high-density lipoprotein levels were associated with elevated risk of MCEs in both studies, whereas high triglycerides in 4S and elevated blood pressure and obesity in AFCAPS/TexCAPS were associated with significantly increased relative risk. Patients with the metabolic syndrome showed increased risk of MCEs irrespective of their Framingham-calculated 10-year risk score category (>20% vs </=20%). These data demonstrate that the metabolic syndrome is associated with increased risk of MCEs in both hypercholesterolemic patients with coronary heart disease in 4S and in those with low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol but without coronary heart disease in AFCAPS/TexCAPS. It appears that the metabolic syndrome is associated with risk that is not entirely accounted for by traditional risk scoring paradigms.

### The effects of cholesterol lowering with simvastatin on cause-specific mortality and on cancer incidence in 20, 536 high-risk people: a randomised placebo-controlled trial [ ISRCTN48489393 ] [^14bfbb7c]. BMC Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Statistical analyses

The main comparisons involved logrank analyses of the first occurrence of particular events during the scheduled treatment period among all those allocated simvastatin versus all those allocated matching placebo tablets (i.e. "intention-to-treat"). These logrank analyses yielded both the event rate ratio (RR) and the test of statistical significance (two-sided probability value). The prespecified primary comparisons were of the effects of allocation to simvastatin on deaths from all causes and, separately, on deaths from all coronary causes and from all non-coronary causes. But since simvastatin appeared to reduce the risk of death not only from coronary causes but also from other vascular causes (as well as preventing non-fatal vascular events), the present analyses are of all vascular deaths and of all non-vascular deaths.

Prespecified secondary comparisons included the effects of simvastatin allocation on specific vascular and non-vascular causes of death, with due allowance made in their interpretation for multiple hypothesis testing, for the effects observed on relevant non-fatal events, and for evidence from other studies. It was not anticipated that there would be adequate statistical power to assess the effects of study treatment on vascular or total mortality directly in different circumstances. Instead, the prespecified comparisons involved assessment of the effects on major coronary events (defined as non-fatal myocardial infarction or coronary death), and on the even larger numbers of major vascular events (i.e. major coronary event, stroke or arterial revascularisation), in the first two years and in the later years of scheduled treatment (in order to determine whether any protective effect increases with time), and in various prespecified subcategories determined at study entry, including: sex; age (<65; ≥65<70; ≥70 years); and pretreatment plasma concentrations of total cholesterol (<5.0; ≥5.0<6.0; ≥6.0 mmol/L) and of LDL cholesterol (<3.0; ≥3.0<3.5; ≥3.5 mmol/L). Pre-specified tertiary comparisons included the effects on vascular mortality separately during years 1–2 and years 3+ of follow-up, on cause-specific mortality in the prespecified subcategories of pretreatment total cholesterol, and on site-specific cancer incidence and cerebral haemorrhage. Tests for heterogeneity or, if more appropriate, trend were to be used to assess whether the proportional effects observed on particular outcomes in specific subcategories differed clearly from the overall effect (after due allowance for multiple comparisons).

Notably, in the statin trials, the absolute yearly event rate observed in each randomized treatment arm was strongly and linearly associated with the absolute achieved LDL-C level (Figure 5 A).In these studies, LDL-C and apoB concentrations had very similar effects on the risk of cardiovascular events per millimole per litre, thus confirming that LDL-C is a satisfactory surrogate for LDL particle number under most circumstances. Furthermore, intravascular ultrasound studies of coronary atherosclerosis involving statin-treated patients have consistently demonstrated that progression of coronary atherosclerotic plaque volume can be substantially arrested at achieved LDL-C levels of ∼1.8 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) (Figure 5 B).

### Randomized clinical trials and recent patterns in the use of statins [^a7bde4da]. American Heart Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Three landmark trials involving 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) were published between 1994 and 1996 (the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study [4S], the West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study, and the Cholesterol and Recurrent Events trial). These trials provided evidence that lipid-lowering therapy decreases cardiovascular events, including mortality. Whether these recent data caused a shift toward statin use has not been evaluated.

Methods

Data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey in 1980, 1981, 1985, and 1989 through 1998 were used. We analyzed 5053 visits by patients taking lipid-lowering medications to office-based physicians selected by stratified random sampling. The main outcome measure was use of specific lipid-lowering medications, including statins.

Results

In 1980 resins and niacin were the most commonly used lipid-lowering medications. By 1985 rising use of fibrates caused reductions in niacin use and resin use. By 1989 statins replaced fibrates as the most heavily used medications. Statin use climbed continuously thereafter, accounting for 90% of visits by patients treated for hypercholesterolemia in 1998. In time series analyses, increases in overall statin use were temporally unrelated to the publication of clinical trials, although the 4S trial may have contributed to a shift from older statins to simvastatin. For patients receiving lipid-lowering therapy in 1993 to 1998, statin use was significantly more likely for female patients, white patients, and patients visiting cardiologists.

Conclusions

Although the market for lipid-lowering medications is dominated by statins, the rise in statins predated the recent clinical trials supporting their use.

### MRC / BHF heart protection study of cholesterol lowering with simvastatin in 20, 536 high-risk individuals: a randomised placebo-controlled trial [^41972726]. Lancet (2002). Excellent credibility.

Background

Throughout the usual LDL cholesterol range in Western populations, lower blood concentrations are associated with lower cardiovascular disease risk. In such populations, therefore, reducing LDL cholesterol may reduce the development of vascular disease, largely irrespective of initial cholesterol concentrations.

Methods

20,536 UK adults (aged 40-80 years) with coronary disease, other occlusive arterial disease, or diabetes were randomly allocated to receive 40 mg simvastatin daily (average compliance: 85%) or matching placebo (average non-study statin use: 17%). Analyses are of the first occurrence of particular events, and compare all simvastatin-allocated versus all placebo-allocated participants. These "intention-to-treat" comparisons assess the effects of about two-thirds (85% minus 17%) taking a statin during the scheduled 5-year treatment period, which yielded an average difference in LDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L (about two-thirds of the effect of actual use of 40 mg simvastatin daily). Primary outcomes were mortality (for overall analyses) and fatal or non-fatal vascular events (for subcategory analyses), with subsidiary assessments of cancer and of other major morbidity.

Findings

All-cause mortality was significantly reduced (1328 [12.9%] deaths among 10,269 allocated simvastatin versus 1507 [14.7%] among 10,267 allocated placebo; p=0.0003), due to a highly significant 18% (SE 5) proportional reduction in the coronary death rate (587 [5.7%] vs 707 [6.9%]; p=0.0005), a marginally significant reduction in other vascular deaths (194 [1.9%] vs 230 [2.2%]; p=0.07), and a non-significant reduction in non-vascular deaths (547 [5.3%] vs 570 [5.6%]; p=0.4). There were highly significant reductions of about one-quarter in the first event rate for non-fatal myocardial infarction or coronary death (898 [8.7%] vs 1212 [11.8%]; p<0.0001), for non-fatal or fatal stroke (444 [4.3%] vs 585 [5.7%]; p<0.0001), and for coronary or non-coronary revascularisation (939 [9.1%] vs 1205 [11.7%]; p<0.0001). For the first occurrence of any of these major vascular events, there was a definite 24% (SE 3; 95% CI 19-28) reduction in the event rate (2033 [19.8%] vs 2585 [25.2%] affected individuals; p<0.0001). During the first year the reduction in major vascular events was not significant, but subsequently it was highly significant during each separate year. The proportional reduction in the event rate was similar (and significant) in each subcategory of participant studied, including: those without diagnosed coronary disease who had cerebrovascular disease, or had peripheral artery disease, or had diabetes; men and, separately, women; those aged either under or over 70 years at entry; and--most notably--even those who presented with LDL cholesterol below 3.0 mmol/L (116 mg/dL), or total cholesterol below 5.0 mmol/L (193 mg/dL). The benefits of simvastatin were additional to those of other cardioprotective treatments. The annual excess risk of myopathy with this regimen was about 0.01%. There were no significant adverse effects on cancer incidence or on hospitalisation for any other non-vascular cause.

Interpretation

Adding simvastatin to existing treatments safely produces substantial additional benefits for a wide range of high-risk patients, irrespective of their initial cholesterol concentrations. Allocation to 40 mg simvastatin daily reduced the rates of myocardial infarction, of stroke, and of revascularisation by about one-quarter. After making allowance for non-compliance, actual use of this regimen would probably reduce these rates by about one-third. Hence, among the many types of high-risk individual studied, 5 years of simvastatin would prevent about 70-100 people per 1000 from suffering at least one of these major vascular events (and longer treatment should produce further benefit). The size of the 5-year benefit depends chiefly on such individuals' overall risk of major vascular events, rather than on their blood lipid concentrations alone.

5.1
Mortality and Coronary Heart Disease Morbidity

Niacin extended-release has not been shown to reduce cardiovascular morbidity or mortality among patients already treated with a statin.

The Atherothrombosis Intervention in Metabolic Syndrome with Low HDL/High Triglycerides:

Impact on Global Health Outcomes (AIM-HIGH) trial was a randomized placebo-controlled trial of 3,414 patients with stable, previously diagnosed cardiovascular disease. Mean baseline lipid levels were LDL-C 74 mg/dL, HDL-C 35 mg/dL, non-HDL-C 111 mg/dL and median triglyceride level of 163 mg/dL to 177 mg/dL. Ninety-four percent of patients were on background statin therapy prior to entering the trial. All participants received simvastatin, 40 to 80 mg per day, plus ezetimibe 10 mg per day if needed, to maintain an LDL-C level of 40 mg/dL to 80 mg/dL, and were randomized to receive niacin extended-release 1,500  to 2,000 mg/day (n=1,718) or matching placebo (IR Niacin, 100 mg to 150 mg, n=1,696). On-treatment lipid changes at two years for LDL-C were -12.0% for the simvastatin plus niacin extended-release group and -5.5% for the simvastatin plus placebo group. HDL-C increased by 25.0% to 42 mg/dL in the simvastatin plus niacin extended-release group and by 9.8% to 38 mg/dL in the simvastatin plus placebo group (P < 0.001). Triglyceride levels decreased by 28.6% in the simvastatin plus niacin extended-release group and by 8.1% in the simvastatin plus placebo group. The primary outcome was an ITT composite of the first study occurrence of coronary heart disease death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, hospitalization for acute coronary syndrome or symptom-driven coronary or cerebral revascularization procedures. The trial was stopped after a mean follow-up period of 3 years owing to a lack of efficacy. The primary outcome occurred in 282 patients in the simvastatin plus niacin extended-release group (16.4%) and in 274 patients in the simvastatin plus placebo group (16.2%) (HR 1.02 [95% CI, 0.87 to 1.21], P=0.79. In an ITT analysis, there were 42 cases of first occurrence of ischemic stroke reported, 27 (1.6%) in the simvastatin plus niacin extended-release group and 15 (0.9%) in the simvastatin plus placebo group, a non-statistically significant result (HR 1.79, [95%CI = 0.95 to 3.36], p=0.071). The on-treatment ischemic stroke events were 19 for the simvastatin plus niacin extended-release group and 15 for the simvastatin plus placebo group [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] .

Regarding medical management for coronary artery disease, more specifically with respect to lipid-lowering therapy, ESC 2024 guidelines recommend to initiate lipid-lowering treatment with an LDL-C goal of < 1.4 mmol/L (55 mg/dL) and a ≥ 50% reduction in LDL-C from baseline.

### Current and future aims of lipid-lowering therapy: changing paradigms and lessons from the heart protection study on standards of efficacy and safety [^afce48bb]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Lipid-lowering guidelines continue to evolve toward the use of (1) global risk assessment, (2) lipid measures other than or in addition to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in assessment of risk and treatment benefit, and (3) recommendations for more aggressive lipid lowering. Findings in the Heart Protection Study (HPS) indicate that high-risk patients benefit from statin therapy initiated at a dose that provides aggressive lowering of LDL cholesterol. Statin treatment in this trial provided consistent benefits in reducing major vascular events among a wide variety of high-risk patients, including those beginning treatment with LDL cholesterol levels <100 mg/dL. The HPS findings therefore suggest that the optimal LDL cholesterol level is well below current target levels. In addition, they provide reassurance that aggressive statin therapy is safe. Frequently, current targets for LDL cholesterol are not achieved in clinical practice, particularly among those patients who have coronary artery disease or are at high risk of disease. More intensive lipid lowering than that currently practiced is necessary to achieve current goals and to provide the aggressive reduction of LDL cholesterol shown to improve outcomes in clinical trials. New statins, such as rosuvastatin, offer the prospect of improved lipid-lowering therapy.

Safety and adverse events

The incidence of all-causality adverse events was similar in all three arms with similar low discontinuation rates. Approximately 24% of patients experienced an adverse event. The majority of events (75.4%) were mild or moderate, and only 4.2% of subjects discontinued due to an adverse event. Peripheral oedema was the only treatment-related adverse event that occurred in >2% of patients, and this occurred exclusively in those who received amlodipine (6.8% in the monotherapy arm and 10.6% in the combination arm, P = 0.46). There was one case of myalgia reported in each group with no elevation in creatine phosphokinase levels. Transitory elevations in alanine aminotransferase (>3× upper limit of normal) were observed in 1% of participants (one subject per arm). No hepatic adverse events were reported.

### Ezetimibe added to statin therapy after acute coronary syndromes [^a38974de]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2015). Excellent credibility.

The study IMPROVE-IT was published by Cannon CP and colleagues in 2015 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Dyslipidemia, ST-elevation myocardial infarction, Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction and Unstable angina. In the IMPROVE-IT study, the trial question was: what is the effect of the addition of ezetimibe to statin therapy in patients who have been hospitalized for an acute coronary syndrome? In the IMPROVE-IT study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the IMPROVE-IT study, the population was: 18144 patients (4416 female, 13728 male). The inclusion criteria were patients who had been hospitalized for an acute coronary syndrome within the preceding 10 days and had LDL cholesterol levels of 50 to 100 mg/dL. The key exclusion criteria were planned CABG for the acute coronary syndrome event, CrCl of < 30 mL/min, active liver disease, or use of statin therapy that had LDL cholesterol-lowering potency > 40 mg of simvastatin. In the IMPROVE-IT study, the interventions were: n=9067 simvastatin-ezetimibe (simvastatin at a dose of 40 mg plus ezetimibe at a dose of 10 mg, once daily) n=9077 simvastatin monotherapy once daily (simvastatin at a dose of 40 mg plus placebo). In the IMPROVE-IT study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in death from cardiovascular causes, major coronary event, or nonfatal stroke, Kaplan-Meier event rate at 7 years (32.7% vs. 34.7%; HR 0.936, 95% CI 0.89 to 0.99). In the IMPROVE-IT study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in median time-weighted average LDL cholesterol level (53.2 vs. 69.9; difference 16.7, 95% CI -17.49 to -16.02). In the IMPROVE-IT study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in rates of prespecified muscle, gallbladder, and hepatic adverse events and cancer. In the IMPROVE-IT study, the conclusion was: in patients who had been hospitalized for an acute coronary syndrome within the preceding 10 days and had LDL cholesterol levels of 50 to 100 mg/dL, simvastatin-ezetimibe was superior to simvastatin monotherapy once daily with respect to death from cardiovascular causes, major coronary event, or nonfatal stroke, Kaplan-Meier event rate at 7 years.

### Comparison of rosuvastatin and atorvastatin for lipid lowering in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: results from the URANUS study [^ceb10d84]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2005). Low credibility.

The elevated cardiovascular risk in patients with type 2 diabetes is primarily attributed to the clustering of atherogenic risk factors, including dyslipidaemia, hypertension, abdominal obesity, left ventricular hypertrophy, and impaired fibrinolysis. For patients with diabetes, European Diabetes Policy Group guidelines published in 1999 and European guidelines for coronary heart disease prevention published in 1998, both recommend that low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels should be <3.0 mmol/L. More recent (2003) European guidelines on cardiovascular disease prevention also recognise type 2 diabetes as a risk factor, and recommend more stringent LDL-C reductions to<2.5 mmol/L. In addition, this goal is recommended by both the American Diabetes Association and the US National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III.

Statins are recognized as first-line therapy for cholesterol lowering, and have been proven to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in large outcome trials in various populations [-]. The benefits of statin therapy extend to patients with diabetes, as shown by subgroup analyses of patients with diabetes in several of the major statin outcome studies, including the Cholesterol And Recurrent Events (CARE) study, the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (4S), the Long-Term Intervention with Pravastatin in Ischemic Disease (LIPID) study and the Heart Protection Study [-]. The Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study (CARDS) recently investigated the effects of lipid lowering with statin therapy specifically in patients with type 2 diabetes. The primary endpoint, time to the first occurrence of acute coronary events, coronary revascularisation or stroke, was significantly reduced by 37% in patients treated with atorvastatin 10 mg compared with placebo (p = 0.001). In addition, LDL-C levels were significantly reduced by 40% in the atorvastatin 10 mg group compared with the placebo group (p < 0.001).

### Potent anti-ischaemic effects of statins in chronic stable angina: incremental benefit beyond lipid lowering? [^83e5ebce]. European Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Patient population and study design

Our trial included patients similar to those frequently encountered by physicians in clinical practice. They were aged 39–82 years, most were already receiving standard anti-anginal and anti-platelet medications, and had well-controlled blood pressure. We designed our study to compare the effects of two drugs with different actions and their combination. We did not include a placebo arm for comparison with the active therapies, as it was considered unethical by the investigator sites. Previous studies have reported substantial reduction in ischaemia and angina in placebo groups of patients experiencing angina and coronary disease due in part to ‘regression to the mean’. We set the threshold for ischaemic activity required for inclusion in the study at a lower level than in previous studies using AECG monitoring to reduce the likelihood of the improvements being due to this phenomenon.

All ECG analyses were conducted by core lab staff who were blinded to therapy assignment and treatment phase. Patients were recruited on the basis of TMI in normal daily life, which was also the primary outcome measure. As in our previous studies, interpretable data were obtained on episodes of ST depression from the majority of patients, with only 9.3% of randomized subjects excluded for technical reasons. We also undertook bicycle tests as a secondary measure, but this proved difficult to standardize and interpret largely due to the patients' good total exercise time at baseline and the variations between centres in the quality of records and conduct of the test.

Future studies

Medical therapy strategies are now moving towards concurrent reduction in multiple risk factors, such as blood pressure and LDL-C, because of emerging evidence for outcome benefit for this approach over individual risk-factor control.This may be due to benefits on the common vascular consequences of risk factors. We now show additional benefits of statin therapy beyond lipid lowering in a frequently encountered patient population, with substantial reduction in symptomatic and asymptomatic ischaemia. Although we did not demonstrate additional benefits with amlodipine and atorvastatin combination therapy, future studies in patients with more severe ischaemia, not controlled by a single agent, as well as of lower-dose combination treatment, will be instructive.

### Combination therapy with statins: who benefits? [^d001222e]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Many lipid-lowering drugs improve cardiovascular (CV) outcomes. However, when therapies have been studied in addition to statins, it has been challenging to show an additional clinical benefit in terms of CV event reduction, although overall safety seems acceptable. This debate has been complicated by recent guidelines that emphasize treatment with high-potency statin monotherapy. Combination therapy allows more patients to successfully reach their ideal lipid targets. Further testing of novel therapies may introduce an era of potent low-density lipoprotein decrease without dependence on statins, but until then, they remain the mainstay of therapy.

### Ezetimibe added to statin therapy after acute coronary syndromes [^2ee1b9e0]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2015). Excellent credibility.

Ezetimibe added to simvastatin after acute coronary syndromes—lipid outcomes and treatment exposure show greater LDL cholesterol lowering with combination therapy. The simvastatin dose was increased to 80 mg for elevated LDL cholesterol levels in 27% of the monotherapy group and 6% of the simvastatin–ezetimibe group; after a median of 6 years, 42% in each group had discontinued study medication, and potential follow-up achieved was 91% for the primary end point and 97% for all-cause mortality. At baseline, the mean LDL cholesterol level was 93.8 mg per deciliter (2.4 mmol per liter) in each group. Among patients with 1-year samples, LDL cholesterol was 69.9 mg per deciliter in the simvastatin-monotherapy group and 53.2 mg per deciliter in the simvastatin–ezetimibe group (P<0.001), a difference of 16.7 mg per deciliter (0.43 mmol per liter) (P<0.001) representing a 24% further lowering; over the follow-up period, average LDL cholesterol levels were 69.5 mg per deciliter versus 53.7 mg per deciliter, and with imputation the between-group difference at 1 year was 12.8 mg per deciliter (0.33 mmol per liter). At 1 year, levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein were all significantly lower with simvastatin–ezetimibe; baseline concomitant thienopyridine use was 7813/9077 (86.1) in the monotherapy group versus 7869/9067 (86.8), and data availability included baseline levels for 9009 and 8990 participants and 1-year levels for 6939 and 6864 participants in the respective groups.

### Effects of pravastatin in 3260 patients with unstable angina: results from the LIPID study [^4d8bf993]. Lancet (2000). Excellent credibility.

Background

The LIPID study is a major trial of secondary prevention of coronary-heart-disease events that includes hospital admission with unstable angina (as well as myocardial infarction) as a qualifying event. In this substudy of LIPID, we compared subsequent cardiovascular risks and the effects of pravastatin in patients with previous unstable angina or previous myocardial infarction.

Methods

3260 patients diagnosed with unstable angina and 5754 with acute myocardial infarction 3-36 months previously were randomly assigned 40 mg pravastatin daily or placebo over a mean of 6.0 years. The risk reduction of a range of cardiovascular events was estimated by means of the hazard ratio in Cox's proportional hazards model.

Findings

Among patients assigned placebo, survival in the two diagnosis groups was similar. The relative risk reduction for mortality with pravastatin was 20.6% in the myocardial infarction group and 26.3% in the unstable angina group (p=0.55). Pravastatin significantly reduced the rates of all prespecified coronary endpoints in the myocardial infarction group. In patients with previous unstable angina, coronary heart disease mortality, total mortality, myocardial infarction, a need for coronary revascularisation, the number of admissions to hospital, and the number of days in hospital were significantly lower with pravastatin. Overall, hospital admission for unstable angina was the most common endpoint (24.6% of the placebo group; 22.3% of the pravastatin group).

Interpretation

Patients who have survived acute myocardial infarction or unstable angina have a similar long-term prognosis, a high occurrence of subsequent unstable angina, and benefit similarly from therapy with pravastatin.

Visit 3—follow-up and potential initiation: If goal levels of atherogenic cholesterol have been attained, responses to therapy should be monitored at intervals of 6 to 12 months. Moderate- or high-intensity statin therapy should be considered for very high-risk patients irrespective of atherogenic cholesterol levels, and if goal levels have not been attained and the patient's levels remain above the threshold for consideration of drug therapy, drug treatment might be initiated.

### Effect of simvastatin on kidney function loss in patients with coronary heart disease: findings from the scandinavian simvastatin survival study (4S) [^255be0b3]. Atherosclerosis (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

Statins have been hypothesized to slow loss of kidney function, however, data is conflicting. This study assessed whether simvastatin reduces rates of kidney function loss in participants with coronary heart disease (CHD).

Methods

We performed a post hoc analysis from the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study, a randomized trial of simvastatin vs. placebo in 4444 men and women with CHD. Kidney disease progression defined as the occurrence of a >or=25% reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) from baseline or development of chronic kidney disease (CKD), defined as estimated GFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m(2). The annual rate of change in estimated GFR was also evaluated. Estimated GFR was determined by the Modified Diet and Renal Disease Study equation.

Results

Change in kidney function could be calculated in 3842 subjects, of whom 409 had CKD at baseline. In the whole population, simvastatin significantly reduced the frequency of a >or=25% decline in kidney function [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 0.68, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.50-0.92; p=0.01] during 5.5 years of follow-up. The adjusted annualized least-square mean decline in estimated GFR in the simvastatin group was lower than that in the placebo group (0.34 mL/min/1.73 m(2)/year vs. 0.41 mL/min/1.73 m(2)/year, respectively; p=0.02). There was no significant effect of simvastatin on kidney function in the subgroup of participants (n=363), who developed incident CKD at the end of follow-up [adjusted OR: 0.89 (95% CI 0.70-1.14; p=0.36)].

Conclusion

Simvastatin was associated with a moderate protective effect on the rate of kidney function loss in participants with CHD.

### Relating lipoprotein (a) concentrations to cardiovascular event risk after acute coronary syndrome: a comparison of 3 tests [^4aaaff9d]. Circulation (2024). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Requests from qualified investigators for data from the ODYSSEY OUTCOMES trial will be considered by its executive steering committee and the sponsor and should be submitted to odysseyoutcomesesc@gmail.com.

Study Population

The design,primary results,total events results,and lipoprotein(a) mass concentration findings,, from the ODYSSEY OUTCOMES trial have been published. A total of 18 924 patients from 1315 sites in 57 countries were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive 75 mg of alirocumab (increased to 150 mg for those who did not achieve a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C] level of <50 mg/dL [1.29 mmol/L]) or matching placebo subcutaneously every 2 weeks. Key inclusion criteria included age ≥40 years, hospitalization with ACS (myocardial infarction or unstable angina) 1 to 12 months before randomization, an LDL-C level ≥70 mg/dL (1.81 mmol/L), a non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level ≥100 mg/dL (2.59 mmol/L), or apolipoprotein B ≥80 mg/dL during stable treatment with 40 to 80 mg of atorvastatin daily, 20 to 40 mg of rosuvastatin daily, or the maximum tolerated dose of either statin. The trial was approved by the institutional review board of each site, and all patients provided informed consent.

Participants without available baseline results from all 3 lipoprotein(a) tests were excluded from the current analyses, including those recruited from countries or sites where additional exploratory laboratory testing was not permitted or not possible. In addition, results from month-4 samples from this cohort were included in the analyses if they were available.

### Insulin resistance syndrome and type 2 diabetes mellitus [^ec8399ac]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus have an elevated risk of morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disease. This risk is partly attributable to an increased prevalence of classic coronary artery disease risk factors and partly because of hyperglycemia itself and a highly atherogenic lipid profile. The altered composition of lipoproteins and lipids in type 2 diabetic patients, termed diabetic dyslipidemia, is characterized by: (1) elevated levels of triglyceride; (2) normal levels of total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C); (3) reduced levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C); (4) elevated levels of apolipoprotein B; (5) a preponderance of small, dense LDL particles; and (6) increased levels of cholesterol-rich very-low-density lipoprotein. In most cases, diabetic dyslipidemia is preceded by hyperinsulinemia resulting from insulin resistance. Because patients with type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance are at a markedly increased risk of atherosclerosis, and because strict control of glycemia has proved beneficial in reducing microangiopathy but not macroangiopathy, treatment of diabetic dyslipidemia should be aggressive. Target levels have, therefore, been set at <2.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL) for LDL-C, <2.3 mmol/L [200 mg/dL] for triglycerides, and >1.15 mmol/L (45 mg/dL) for HDL-C. Trial data suggest that these target levels are likely to be achieved with statins, if necessary, in combination with fibrates or nicotinic acid derivatives. Furthermore, in large-scale clinical trials (eg, Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study [4S] and the Cholesterol and Recurrent Events [CARE] study), it has been demonstrated that lipid lowering can appreciably reduce cardiovascular events in diabetic patients.

### Benefits of pravastatin on cardiovascular events and mortality in older patients with coronary heart disease are equal to or exceed those seen in younger patients: results from the LIPID trial [^151e490e]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Background

The effect of cholesterol-lowering therapy on death from coronary heart disease in older patients with previous coronary heart disease and average cholesterol levels is uncertain.

Objective

To compare the relative and absolute effects of pravastatin on cardiovascular disease outcomes in patients with coronary heart disease who are 65 years of age or older with those in patients 31 to 64 years of age.

Design

Subgroup analysis of a randomized, placebo-controlled trial.

Setting

87 centers in Australia and New Zealand.

Patients

3514 patients 65 to 75 years of age, chosen from among 9014 patients with previous myocardial infarction or unstable angina and a baseline plasma cholesterol level of 4.0 to 7.0 mmol/L (155 to 271 mg/dL).

Intervention

Pravastatin, 40 mg/d, or placebo.

Measurements

Major cardiovascular disease events over 6 years.

Results

Older patients were at greater risk than younger patients (31 to 64 years of age) for death (20.6% vs. 9.8%), myocardial infarction (11.4% vs. 9.5%), unstable angina (26.7% vs. 23.2%), and stroke (6.7% vs. 3.1%) (all P < 0.001). Pravastatin reduced the risk for all cardiovascular disease events, and similar relative effects were observed in older and younger patients. In patients 65 to 75 years of age, pravastatin therapy reduced mortality by 21% (CI, 7% to 32%), death from coronary heart disease by 24% (CI, 7% to 38%), coronary heart disease death or nonfatal myocardial infarction by 22% (CI, 9% to 34%), myocardial infarction by 26% (CI, 9% to 40%), and stroke by 12% (CI, -15% to 32%). For every 1000 older patients treated over 6 years, pravastatin prevented 45 deaths, 33 myocardial infarctions, 32 unstable angina events, 34 coronary revascularization procedures, 13 strokes, or 133 major cardiovascular events, compared with 22 deaths and 107 major cardiovascular events per 1000 younger patients. Among older patients, the numbers needed to treat were 22 (CI, 17 to 36) to prevent one death from any cause, 35 (CI, 24 to 67) to prevent one death from coronary heart disease, and 21 (CI, 17 to 31) to prevent one coronary heart disease death or nonfatal myocardial infarction.

Conclusions

In older patients with coronary heart disease and average or moderately elevated cholesterol levels, pravastatin therapy reduced the risk for all major cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality. Since older patients are at greater risk than younger patients for these events, the absolute benefit of treatment is significantly greater in older patients.

### Imaging as a surrogate marker of drug efficacy in cardiovascular disease [^973a6e40]. Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

Use of imaging for testing drug efficacy in atherosclerosis

Here we discuss how various imaging biomarkers have been applied in clinical drug trials to study the efficacy of disease modifying therapies in atherosclerosis, including both long-established and newly tested lipid-lowering and anti-inflammatory agents.

Lipid-lowering and other drugs affecting cholesterol

Statins

Statins reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) through inhibition of β-Hydroxy β-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA (HMG CoA)reductase and have been proven in landmark clinical trials to dramatically reduce the incidence of cardiovascular events in a range of individuals,with greater benefit seen for intensive versus moderate or low-dose therapy in patients with stable angina or previous MI.In fact, patients treated with statins who achieve LDL-c lowering of 2–3 mmol/L are expected to have a 40%–50% reduction in cardiovascular risk regardless of their baseline lipid profile.While the clinical benefits of statins have long been proven, contemporary imaging studies have nonetheless contributed important mechanistic insights revealing the multiple effects of statins on the arterial wall and atherosclerotic plaques. Collectively, these studies have demonstrated that treatment with statins can result in reduction of arterial inflammation, IMT, plaque volume and lipid content of the necrotic core, as well as a modest increase in angiographic luminal diameter and increased fibrous cap thickness and arterial macrocalcification contributing to plaque stability.

### Clinical efficacy and safety of evolocumab in high-risk patients receiving a statin: secondary analysis of patients with low LDL cholesterol levels and in those already receiving a maximal-potency statin in a randomized clinical trial [^8002e8fe]. JAMA Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

Current guidelines for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease focus on high-intensity statins and targeting or using a threshold low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level of less than 70 mg/dL for the highest-risk patients. Whether further reduction of LDL-C beyond these boundaries would be beneficial is unknown.

Objective

To compare outcomes of evolocumab vs placebo in patients with stable atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and a baseline LDL-C of less than 70 mg/dL and in those receiving background treatment with a maximal-potency statin.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This secondary ad hoc analysis of the Further Cardiovascular Outcomes Research With PCSK9 Inhibition in Subjects With Elevated Risk (FOURIER) trial compared randomized treatments in 2 subgroups of patients with stable atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease currently receiving statin. Patients were classified by a baseline LDL-C of less than 70 or at least 70 mg/dL and by statin intensity (maximal: atorvastatin calcium, 80 mg/d, or rosuvastatin, 40 mg/d; submaximal: all other dosages). Patients with baseline LDL of less than 70 mg/dL either had a final screening LDL-C of at least 70 mg/dL or a final screening non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level of at least 100 mg/dL. Data were retrieved from 2013 to 2016 and analyzed in 2017 based on intention to treat.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary efficacy endpoint was the composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina, or coronary revascularization. The secondary efficacy endpoint was the composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke. Safety outcomes included adverse events and events of interest identified in the FOURIER trial. Interaction testing was used to assess the consistency of results in patients who did vs did not satisfy the above criteria.

Results

A total of 27 564 patients (75.4% men and 24.6% women; mean [SD] age, 62.5 [9.0] years) were included in the analysis. Of 2034 patients (7.4%) who had a baseline LDL-C of less than 70 mg/dL, evolocumab reduced the risk for the primary endpoint (hazard ratio [HR], 0.80; 95% CI, 0.60-1.07) to a similar degree as in the 25 529 patients who had baseline LDL-C of at least 70 mg/dL (HR 0.86; 95% CI, 0.79-0.92; P=.65 for interaction; 1 patient was missing baseline LDL-C data). Of 7533 patients (27.3%) receiving maximal-potency statins, evolocumab significantly reduced the primary endpoint (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.75-0.98) to a similar degree as in the 20 031 patients not receiving a maximal-potency statin (HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.78-0.93; P=.88 for interaction). The key secondary endpoint was reduced to a similar degree in both analyses. No major safety concerns were identified.

Conclusions and Relevance

Evolocumab was equally effective in reducing cardiovascular events in patients with stable atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease regardless of whether the baseline LDL-C was less than 70 or at least 70 mg/dL and whether the background statin was of maximal or submaximal potency.

### Relations of change in plasma levels of LDL-C, non-HDL-C and apoB with risk reduction from statin therapy: a meta-analysis of randomized trials [^7e1a8f93]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Methods

Data Sources

We searched the literature using PubMed from inception to January 1, 2013 to identify all placebo‐controlled RCTs of statin therapy using the following search strategy adapted from Boekholdt et al: hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme‐A reductase inhibitor, statin, atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, simvastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, apolipoprotein, cholesterol, coronary heart disease, and cardiovascular disease. We included only trials that reported 1‐year changes from baseline in LDL‐C, non‐HDL‐C, and apoB during statin therapy. We also excluded trials with a short duration (<2 years) of follow‐up or with fewer than 1000 participants enrolled. Two authors (G.T. and K.W.) screened and abstracted reported baseline and 1‐year levels of cholesterol and apolipoprotein values (or change at 1 year, if reported) as well as reported relative risk reductions for all cardiovascular endpoints. Any discordance in abstracted data was resolved by consensus (G.T. K.W. A.D.S.). Amongst the statin trials, we excluded those such as Post‐CABGin which multiple drugs were allowed to reach the target that had been selected. We also excluded statin trials that compared doses of statins, because the greatest benefit and the greatest reductions occur with the initial dose. The between‐group differences both of change in markers and relative risk reduction will be much smaller and therefore less reliable than those observed in the statin vs placebo‐design trials. For each included trial, we selected the most comprehensive published coronary heart disease (CHD) composite outcome for the meta‐analysis. The composite coronary heart disease (CHD) outcome selected from each trial's report included myocardial infarction and coronary death. 4S,CARDS,and SPARCLalso included resuscitated cardiac arrest. In AFCAPS/TexCAPS,JUPITER,CARDS,and SPARCLunstable angina was also included whereas in JUPITER,CARDS,and SPARCLrevascularization was included in the CHD outcome. We selected CHD rather than total cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes because ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes were not always adequately differentiated and LDL is more closely related to the pathophysiology of ischemic strokes as opposed to hemorrhagic strokes. To calculate the reductions in lipid markers on statin therapy, we calculated the difference in lipid markers from baseline to 1 year in the treatment arm and corrected this difference for the difference in the lipid markers at baseline to 1 year in the control arm to limit regression‐dilution bias.

6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

The following important adverse reactions are described below and elsewhere in the labeling:

Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]
Immune-Mediated Necrotizing Myopathy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]
Hepatic Dysfunction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]
Increases in HbA1c and Fasting Serum Glucose Levels [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

In clinical studies, 2,423 adult patients were exposed to simvastatin with a median duration of follow-up of approximately 18 months. The most commonly reported adverse reactions (incidence ≥5%) in these simvastatin clinical studies were: upper respiratory infections (9%), headache (7%), abdominal pain (7%), constipation (7%), and nausea (5%). Overall, 1.4% of patients discontinued simvastatin due to adverse reactions. The most common adverse reactions that led to discontinuation were: gastrointestinal disorders (0.5%), myalgia (0.1%), and arthralgia (0.1%).

In a Cardiovascular Outcomes Study (the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study [Study 4S]), adult patients (age range 35 to 71 years, 19% women, 100% Caucasians) were treated with 20 to 40 mg per day of simvastatin or placebo over a median of 5.4 years [see Clinical Studies (14)] ; adverse reactions reported in ≥2% of patients and at a rate greater than placebo are shown in Table 1.

### Efficacy and safety of more intensive lowering of LDL cholesterol: a meta-analysis of data from 170, 000 participants in 26 randomised trials [^f6d0e312]. Lancet (2010). Excellent credibility.

Background

Lowering of LDL cholesterol with standard statin regimens reduces the risk of occlusive vascular events in a wide range of individuals. We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of more intensive lowering of LDL cholesterol with statin therapy.

Methods

We undertook meta-analyses of individual participant data from randomised trials involving at least 1000 participants and at least 2 years' treatment duration of more versus less intensive statin regimens (five trials; 39612 individuals; median follow-up 5·1 years) and of statin versus control (21 trials; 129526 individuals; median follow-up 4·8 years). For each type of trial, we calculated not only the average risk reduction, but also the average risk reduction per 1·0 mmol/L LDL cholesterol reduction at 1 year after randomisation.

Findings

In the trials of more versus less intensive statin therapy, the weighted mean further reduction in LDL cholesterol at 1 year was 0·51 mmol/L. Compared with less intensive regimens, more intensive regimens produced a highly significant 15% (95% CI 11-18; p<0·0001) further reduction in major vascular events, consisting of separately significant reductions in coronary death or non-fatal myocardial infarction of 13% (95% CI 7-19; p<0·0001), in coronary revascularisation of 19% (95% CI 15-24; p<0·0001), and in ischaemic stroke of 16% (95% CI 5-26; p=0·005). Per 1·0 mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol, these further reductions in risk were similar to the proportional reductions in the trials of statin versus control. When both types of trial were combined, similar proportional reductions in major vascular events per 1·0 mmol/L LDL cholesterol reduction were found in all types of patient studied (rate ratio [RR] 0·78, 95% CI 0·76-0·80; p<0·0001), including those with LDL cholesterol lower than 2 mmol/L on the less intensive or control regimen. Across all 26 trials, all-cause mortality was reduced by 10% per 1·0 mmol/L LDL reduction (RR 0·90, 95% CI 0·87-0·93; p<0·0001), largely reflecting significant reductions in deaths due to coronary heart disease (RR 0·80, 99% CI 0·74-0·87; p<0·0001) and other cardiac causes (RR 0·89, 99% CI 0·81-0·98; p=0·002), with no significant effect on deaths due to stroke (RR 0·96, 95% CI 0·84-1·09; p=0·5) or other vascular causes (RR 0·98, 99% CI 0·81-1·18; p=0·8). No significant effects were observed on deaths due to cancer or other non-vascular causes (RR 0·97, 95% CI 0·92-1·03; p=0·3) or on cancer incidence (RR 1·00, 95% CI 0·96-1·04; p=0·9), even at low LDL cholesterol concentrations.

Interpretation

Further reductions in LDL cholesterol safely produce definite further reductions in the incidence of heart attack, of revascularisation, and of ischaemic stroke, with each 1·0 mmol/L reduction reducing the annual rate of these major vascular events by just over a fifth. There was no evidence of any threshold within the cholesterol range studied, suggesting that reduction of LDL cholesterol by 2-3 mmol/L would reduce risk by about 40-50%.

### Intensive versus moderate lipid lowering with statins after acute coronary syndromes [^0075b1a8]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2004). Excellent credibility.

Background

Lipid-lowering therapy with statins reduces the risk of cardiovascular events, but the optimal level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol is unclear.

Methods

We enrolled 4162 patients who had been hospitalized for an acute coronary syndrome within the preceding 10 days and compared 40 mg of pravastatin daily (standard therapy) with 80 mg of atorvastatin daily (intensive therapy). The primary end point was a composite of death from any cause, myocardial infarction, documented unstable angina requiring rehospitalization, revascularization (performed at least 30 days after randomization), and stroke. The study was designed to establish the noninferiority of pravastatin as compared with atorvastatin with respect to the time to an end-point event. Follow-up lasted 18 to 36 months (mean, 24).

Results

The median LDL cholesterol level achieved during treatment was 95 mg per deciliter (2.46 mmol per liter) in the standard-dose pravastatin group and 62 mg per deciliter (1.60 mmol per liter) in the high-dose atorvastatin group (P<0.001). Kaplan-Meier estimates of the rates of the primary end point at two years were 26.3 percent in the pravastatin group and 22.4 percent in the atorvastatin group, reflecting a 16 percent reduction in the hazard ratio in favor of atorvastatin (P=0.005; 95 percent confidence interval, 5 to 26 percent). The study did not meet the prespecified criterion for equivalence but did identify the superiority of the more intensive regimen.

Conclusions

Among patients who have recently had an acute coronary syndrome, an intensive lipid-lowering statin regimen provides greater protection against death or major cardiovascular events than does a standard regimen. These findings indicate that such patients benefit from early and continued lowering of LDL cholesterol to levels substantially below current target levels.

### Simvastatin (floLipid) [^0641379f]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Of the 2,423 patients who received simvastatin in Phase III clinical studies and the 10,269 patients in the Heart Protection Study who received simvastatin, 363 (15%) and 5,366 (52%), respectively were ≥65 years old. In HPS, 615 (6%) were ≥75 years old. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Since advanced age (≥65 years) is a predisposing factor for myopathy, FLOLIPID should be prescribed with caution in the elderly. [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3).]

A pharmacokinetic study with simvastatin showed the mean plasma level of statin activity to be approximately 45% higher in elderly patients between 70 to 78 years of age compared with patients between 18 to 30 years of age. In 4S, 1,021 (23%) of 4,444 patients were 65 or older. Lipid-lowering efficacy was at least as great in elderly patients compared with younger patients, and simvastatin significantly reduced total mortality and CHD mortality in elderly patients with a history of CHD. In HPS, 52% of patients were elderly (4,891 patients 65 to 69 years and 5,806 patients 70 years or older). The relative risk reductions of CHD death, non-fatal MI, coronary and non-coronary revascularization procedures, and stroke were similar in older and younger patients [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. In HPS, among 32,145 patients entering the active run-in period, there were 2 cases of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis; these patients were aged 67 and 73. Of the 7 cases of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis among 10,269 patients allocated to simvastatin, 4 were aged 65 or more (at baseline), of whom one was over 75. There were no overall differences in safety between older and younger patients in either 4S or HPS.

Because advanced age (≥65 years) is a predisposing factor for myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, FLOLIPID should be prescribed with caution in the elderly. In a clinical trial of patients treated with simvastatin 80 mg/day, patients ≥65 years of age had an increased risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, compared to patients <65 years of age. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3).]

### Rationale, design, methods and baseline demography of participants of the anglo-scandinavian cardiac outcomes trial. ASCOT investigators [^75d9a2d0]. Journal of Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To test the primary hypothesis that a newer antihypertensive treatment regimen (calcium channel blocker +/- an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor) is more effective than an older regimen (beta-blocker +/- a diuretic) in the primary prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD). To test a second primary hypothesis that a statin compared with placebo will further protect against CHD endpoints in hypertensive subjects with a total cholesterol < or = 6.5 mmol/l.

Design

Prospective, randomized, open, blinded endpoint trial with a double-blinded 2 x 2 factorial component.

Setting

Patients were recruited mainly from general practices.

Patients

Men and women aged 40-79 were eligible if their blood pressure was > or = 160 mmHg systolic or > or = 100 mmHg diastolic (untreated) or > or = 140 mmHg systolic or > or = 90 mmHg diastolic (treated) at randomization.

Interventions

Patients received either amlodipine (5/ 10 mg) +/- perindopril (4/8 mg) or atenolol (50/ 100 mg) +/- bendroflumethiazide (1.25/2.5 mg) +K+ with further therapy as required to reach a blood pressure of < or = 140 mmHg systolic and 90 mmHg diastolic. Patients with a total cholesterol of < or = 6.5 mmol/l were further randomized to receive either atorvastatin 10 mg or placebo daily.

Main Outcome Measure

Non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) and fatal coronary heart disease (CHD).

Results

19 342 men and women were initially randomized, of these 10297 were also randomized into the lipid-lowering limb. All patients had three or more additional cardiovascular risk factors.

Conclusions

The study has 80% power (at the 5% level) to detect a relative difference of 20% in CHD endpoints between the calcium channel blocker-based regimen and the beta-blocker-based regimen. The lipid-lowering limb of the study has 90% power at the 1% level to detect a relative difference of 30% in CHD endpoints between groups.

5.1 Mortality and Coronary Heart Disease Morbidity

The Atherothrombosis Intervention in Metabolic Syndrome with Low HDL/High Triglycerides: Impact on Global Health Outcomes (AIM-HIGH) trial was a randomized placebo-controlled trial of 3414 patients with stable, previously diagnosed cardiovascular disease. Mean baseline lipid levels were LDL-C 74 mg/dL, HDL-C 35 mg/dL, non-HDL-C 111 mg/dL and median triglyceride level of 163-177 mg/dL. Ninety-four percent of patients were on background statin therapy prior to entering the trial. All participants received simvastatin, 40 to 80 mg per day, plus ezetimibe 10 mg per day if needed, to maintain an LDL-C level of 40-80 mg/dL, and were randomized to receive NIASPAN 1500-2000 mg/day (n=1718) or matching placebo (IR Niacin, 100-150 mg, n=1696). On-treatment lipid changes at two years for LDL-C were -12.0% for the simvastatin plus NIASPAN group and -5.5% for the simvastatin plus placebo group. HDL-C increased by 25.0% to 42 mg/dL in the simvastatin plus NIASPAN group and by 9.8% to 38 mg/dL in the simvastatin plus placebo group (P<0.001). Triglyceride levels decreased by 28.6% in the simvastatin plus NIASPAN group and by 8.1% in the simvastatin plus placebo group. The primary outcome was an ITT composite of the first study occurrence of coronary heart disease death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, hospitalization for acute coronary syndrome or symptom-driven coronary or cerebral revascularization procedures. The trial was stopped after a mean follow-up period of 3 years owing to a lack of efficacy. The primary outcome occurred in 282 patients in the simvastatin plus NIASPAN group (16.4%) and in 274 patients in the simvastatin plus placebo group (16.2%) (HR 1.02 [95% CI, 0.87-1.21], P=0.79. In an ITT analysis, there were 42 cases of first occurrence of ischemic stroke reported, 27 (1.6%) in the simvastatin plus NIASPAN group and 15 (0.9%) in the simvastatin plus placebo group, a non-statistically significant (HR 1.79, [95%CI = 0.95-3.36], p=0.071).   The on-treatment ischemic stroke events were 19 for the simvastatin plus NIASPAN group and 15 for the simvastatin plus placebo group . result [see Adverse Reactions] (6.1)

Ezetimibe added to statin therapy after acute coronary syndromes—eligibility criteria: Adults at least 50 years of age hospitalized within the preceding 10 days for an acute coronary syndrome (acute myocardial infarction with or without ST-segment elevation, or high-risk unstable angina) were eligible, with an LDL cholesterol level of 50 mg per deciliter (1.3 mmol per liter) or higher. For participants not receiving long-term lipid-lowering therapy, the maximum enrollment LDL was 125 mg per deciliter (3.2 mmol per liter), whereas for those receiving lipid-lowering therapy the maximum level was 100 mg per deciliter (2.6 mmol per liter). The eligibility LDL was measured locally within the first 24 hours after onset of the acute coronary syndrome. Key exclusions were planned coronary-artery bypass grafting for the index event and lipid-lowering therapy with LDL-lowering potency greater than 40 mg of simvastatin.

Table 2:Adverse Reactions Reported Regardless of Causality by ≥ 2% of Patients Treated with Simvastatin and Greater than Placebo in 4S

Heart Protection Study

In the Heart Protection Study (HPS), involving 20,536 patients (age range 40-80 years, 25% women, 97% Caucasians, 3% other races) treated with simvastatin 40 mg/day (n=10,269) or placebo (n=10,267) over a mean of 5 years, only serious adverse reactions and discontinuations due to any adverse reactions were recorded. Discontinuation rates due to adverse reactions were 4.8% in patients treated with simvastatin compared with 5.1% in patients treated with placebo. The incidence of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis was <0.1% in patients treated with simvastatin.

Other Clinical Studies

In a clinical trial in which 12,064 patients with a history of myocardial infarction were treated with simvastatin (mean follow-up 6.7 years), the incidence of myopathy (defined as unexplained muscle weakness or pain with a serum creatine kinase [CK] >10 times upper limit of normal [ULN]) in patients on 80 mg/day was approximately 0.9% compared with 0.02% for patients on 20 mg/day. The incidence of rhabdomyolysis (defined as myopathy with a CK >40 times ULN) in patients on 80 mg/day was approximately 0.4% compared with 0% for patients on 20 mg/day. The incidence of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, was highest during the first year and then notably decreased during the subsequent years of treatment. In this trial, patients were carefully monitored and some interacting medicinal products were excluded.

### Efficacy and safety of further lowering of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in patients starting with very low levels: a meta-analysis [^0190dddf]. JAMA Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

In the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists Collaboration (CTTC), in patients starting with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels of approximately 3.4 mmol/L (131.5 mg/dL), there was a 22% reduction in major vascular events per 1-mmol/L (38.7-mg/dL) lowering of LDL-C. The magnitude of clinical benefit of further LDL-C lowering in patients already with very low LDL-C levels remains debated.

Objective

To evaluate efficacy and safety of further lowering LDL-C levels in patient populations presenting with median LDL-C levels of 1.8 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) or less.

Data Sources and Study Selection

The CTTC was used for statin data. For nonstatin therapy, Medline database was searched (2015-April 2018). Key inclusion criteria were a randomized, double-blind, controlled cardiovascular outcome trial of LDL-C lowering with data in populations starting with LDL-C levels averaging 1.8 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) or less.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Two authors independently extracted data into standardized data sheets, and data were analyzed using meta-analysis.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The risk ratio (RR) of major vascular events (a composite of coronary heart death, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, or coronary revascularization) per 1-mmol/L (38.7-mg/dL) reduction in LDL-C level.

Results

In the subgroup of patients from the CTTC meta-analysis of statins with a mean LDL-C in the control arm of 1.7 mmol/L (65.7 mg/dL), 1922 major vascular events occurred and the RR for major vascular events per 1-mmol/L (38.7-mg/dL) reduction in LDL-C was 0.78 (95% CI, 0.65-0.94). For 3 trials of nonstatin LDL-C-lowering therapies added to statins, there were 50 627 patients, the median LDL-C in the control arms ranged from 1.6 mmol/L to 1.8 mmol/L (63 mg/dL to 70 mg/dL), and 9570 major vascular events occurred. Nonstatin therapy lowered LDL-C by 0.3 to 1.2 mmol/L (11 mg/dL to 45 mg/dL), and the RR for major vascular events per 1-mmol/L (38.7-mg/dL) reduction in LDL-C was 0.79 (95% CI, 0.70-0.88). For statins and nonstatins combined, the RR was 0.79 (95% CI, 0.71-0.87; P<.001). Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering was not associated with an increased risk of serious adverse events, myalgias and/or myositis, elevation in the level of aminotransferases, new-onset diabetes, hemorrhagic stroke, or cancer.

Conclusions and Relevance

There is a consistent relative risk reduction in major vascular events per change in LDL-C in patient populations starting as low as a median of 1.6 mmol/L (63 mg/dL) and achieving levels as low as a median of 0.5 mmol/L (21 mg/dL), with no observed offsetting adverse effects. These data suggest further lowering of LDL-C beyond the lowest current targets would further reduce cardiovascular risk.

### Recurrence of cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes: epidemiology and risk factors [^8a9aebdf]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

In our population of diabetic patients receiving usual care, we found that every year, 6.1% of the patients with a prior CVD event developed a new major atherosclerotic complication. This percentage compares very well with those (5.9–6.0% per year) of the cohorts of diabetic patients in secondary prevention analyzed in the PROactive study and the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (4S). A higher rate of 7.6% per year was reported in the Drugs and Evidence-Based Medicine in the Elderly (DEBATE) study, but that study was performed in subjects with a higher mean age (80 years).

The incidence rate of recurrent events in cohort B was almost half that of cohort A. Likely explanations of this difference are that among cohort B patients, there were more women, age was somewhat younger, familial CVD was less prevalent, and prior myocardial infarction was less frequent relative to prior stroke. Moreover, and more importantly, these patients had a shorter and more recent CVD history and were observed for only 1.7 year on average. The patients in cohort A, on the other hand, were “survivors” of a CVD event that preceded the recurrent event by a longer span of time; in fact, there was a remarkable difference in terms of number of years from first and recurrent event, which could be the explanation for this different outcome.

Regarding medical management for coronary artery disease, more specifically with respect to lipid-lowering therapy, ACC/ACCP/AHA/ASPC/NLA/PCNA 2023 guidelines recommend to consider initiating a PCSK9 monoclonal antibody to further reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with chronic coronary disease deemed to be at very high risk and having an LDL-C level ≥ 70 mg/dL (≥ 1.8 mmol/L) or a non-HDL-C level ≥ 100 mg/dL (≥ 2.6 mmol/L), and on maximally tolerated statin and ezetimibe.

### Benefits of statin therapy in patients with special risks: coronary bypass surgery, stable coronary disease, and acute coronary syndromes [^34f86cb3]. Clinical Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Several major clinical studies have examined the impact of lipid lowering in patients with and without coronary heart disease and have demonstrated that lowering lipid levels can successfully and significantly delay the onset of cardiovascular events. Although epidemiologic studies and small clinical trials have suggested that more aggressive and sustained lowering of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) to < 100 mg/dl (2.6 mmol/l) can result in reductions in cardiovascular events in these populations, reducing LDL-C to these concentrations has only recently been shown in larger clinical trials. However, few clinical trials have been conducted in patients with certain special high risks, such as those who have had a recent revascularization procedure or have experienced an acute coronary event. Three trials examined the short- and long-term clinical benefits of aggressive lipid lowering in patients who underwent coronary artery bypass surgery (Post-CABG), were candidates for angioplasty (AVERT), or were hospitalized for acute coronary syndromes (MIRACL).

Statin therapy evidence notes and FDA caution—dose considerations for atorvastatin and simvastatin: All of these randomized controlled trials demonstrated a reduction in major cardiovascular events, and individual responses to statin therapy varied in RCTs and should be expected to vary in clinical practice. Evidence from 1 RCT only supports down-titration if unable to tolerate atorvastatin 80 mg in the IDEAL study. Although simvastatin 80 mg was evaluated in RCTs, initiation of simvastatin 80 mg or titration to 80 mg is not recommended by the FDA because of the increased risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis.

Methods

The ODYSSEY OUTCOMES trial

The design and principal results of the ODYSSEY OUTCOMES trial have been reported. At each of 1315 sites in 57 countries, the trial was approved by the responsible institutional review committee, and patients gave informed consent. One to 12 months (median 2.6) after an ACS, 18 924 patients with elevated levels of atherogenic lipoproteins despite high-intensity or maximum-tolerated statin treatment were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to treatment with alirocumab 75 mg or placebo, administered subcutaneously every 2 weeks. Plasma lipids were measured at randomization, at 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 months after randomization, and at 6-month intervals thereafter. LDL-C was calculated with the Friedewald formula unless the calculated value was <0.39 mmol/L or the concurrent triglyceride level was ≥4.52 mmol/L. In those cases, LDL-C was measured directly by preparative ultracentrifugation and beta-quantitation. The alirocumab dose could be blindly increased to 150 mg if LDL-C remained >1.3 mmol/L (50 mg/dL) on the 75 mg dose. Conversely, if two consecutive measurements of LDL-C were <0.39 mmol/L on the 75 mg dose, alirocumab was blindly replaced by placebo at the next study visit, and placebo was continued for the remainder of the study. The protocol did not specify any adjustment of background statin or other oral lipid-lowering therapy based on achieved LDL-C levels. The primary endpoint of the trial was the composite of death from coronary heart disease, non-fatal myocardial infarction, hospitalization for unstable angina, or ischaemic stroke. All-cause death and ischaemia-driven coronary revascularization were among pre-specified secondary endpoints.

### Ezetimibe added to statin therapy after acute coronary syndromes [^57f0813a]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2015). Excellent credibility.

Ezetimibe and statin after acute coronary syndromes—primary, secondary, and individual end points are reported with simvastatin–ezetimibe compared with simvastatin monotherapy (N=9067 vs N=9077). The primary end point (death from cardiovascular causes, major coronary event, or nonfatal stroke) occurred in 2572 (32.7) with simvastatin–ezetimibe versus 2742 (34.7) with monotherapy, hazard ratio 0.936 (0.89–0.99), P 0.016. For the prespecified composite “death from cardiovascular causes, MI, or stroke,” events were 1544 (20.4) versus 1704 (22.2), hazard ratio 0.90 (0.84–0.96), P 0.003. Individual end points included any MI: 977 (13.1) versus 1118 (14.8), hazard ratio 0.87 (0.80–0.95), P 0.002; ischemic stroke: 236 (3.4) versus 297 (4.1), hazard ratio 0.79 (0.67–0.94), P 0.008; and urgent coronary revascularization ≥30 days after randomization: 510 (7.0) versus 626 (8.6), hazard ratio 0.81 (0.72–0.91), P 0.001. Percentages are 7-year Kaplan–Meier estimates; individual end points are the first occurrence of that event; major coronary events included MI, hospitalization for unstable angina, and coronary revascularization 30 or more days after randomization.

### Cardiovascular events and long-term risk of sudden death among stabilized patients after acute coronary syndrome: insights from IMPROVE-IT [^9ae4aef4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

Data to reproduce the results presented herewith can be made available upon reasonable request.

Data Source

IMPROVE‐IT was a double‐blind, placebo‐controlled randomized trial of stabilized patients after ACS with inclusion criteria of ≥50 years of age and hospitalization with an ACS (MI with or without ST‐segment elevation or high‐risk unstable angina). Their condition had stabilized during the preceding 10 days as previously described.Between October 26, 2005, and July 8, 2010, a total of 18 144 patients underwent randomization at 1147 sites in 39 countries. Patients were randomized to ezetimibe plus simvastatin or simvastatin plus placebo. The primary composite end point was cardiovascular death, nonfatal MI, unstable angina requiring rehospitalization, coronary revascularization (≥30 days after randomization), or nonfatal stroke. The median follow‐up was 6 years.

Patients were excluded if they were considered clinically unstable and defined as displaying any of the following events within 24 hours before screening and randomization: (1) hemodynamic instability, including hypotension defined as sustained systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg attributed to cardiac failure with associated symptoms, unstable or severe pulmonary edema/decompensated HF, acute mitral regurgitation, or acute ventricular septal defect; (2) recurrent symptoms of cardiac ischemia; (3) stroke or transient ischemic attack; (4) arrhythmic events, including ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia lasting >30 seconds or in association with symptoms, complete heart block or high‐grade, second‐degree heart block; and (5) creatinine clearance <30 mL/min or receiving dialysis. Institutional review boards at participating sites approved the protocol and all patients provided written informed consent.

End Points

An independent clinical events committee whose members were unaware of randomized treatment assignment adjudicated primary end point events and all deaths that were classified according to prespecified criteria. The definition of sudden death was death that occurred suddenly and unexpectedly, and methods for the collection and adjudication of sudden death were performed in a manner similar to prior studies.Sudden death must have been documented to have occurred within 24 hours. Postrandomization cardiovascular events before sudden death that were also adjudicated included nonfatal MI, unstable angina requiring hospital admission, and stroke. Definitions for each end point, including sudden death, were described previously in the Clinical Events Committee Manual of Operations.Hospitalization for HF at least 30 days after randomization was determined by the site investigators.

### Medical management of stable coronary artery disease [^a9c80b6e]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

All patients with stable coronary artery disease require medical therapy to prevent disease progression and recurrent cardiovascular events. Three classes of medication are essential to therapy: lipid-lowering, antihypertensive, and antiplatelet agents. Lipid-lowering therapy is necessary to decrease low-density lipoprotein cholesterol to a target level of less than 100 mg per dL, and physicians should consider a goal of less than 70 mg per dL for very high-risk patients. Statins have demonstrated clear benefits in morbidity and mortality in the secondary prevention of coronary artery disease; other medications that can be used in addition to statins to lower cholesterol include ezetimibe, fibrates, and nicotinic acid. Blood pressure therapy for patients with coronary artery disease should start with beta blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. If these medications are not tolerated, calcium channel blockers or angiotensin receptor blockers are acceptable alternatives. Aspirin is the first-line antiplatelet agent except in patients who have recently had a myocardial infarction or undergone stent placement, in which case clopidogrel is recommended. Anginal symptoms of coronary artery disease can be treated with beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, nitrates, or any combination of these. Familiarity with these medications and with the evidence supporting their use is essential to reducing morbidity and mortality in patients with coronary artery disease.

Regarding medical management for coronary artery disease, more specifically with respect to lipid-lowering therapy, ACC/ACCP/AHA/ASPC/NLA/PCNA 2023 guidelines recommend to obtain fasting lipids in 4-12 weeks after statin initiation or dose adjustment to assess adherence to changes in lifestyle and effects of lipid-lowering therapy and every 3-12 months thereafter based on a need to assess response or adherence to therapy.

### Statins for acute coronary syndrome [^1a99c2e3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The early period following the onset of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) represents a critical stage of coronary heart disease with a high risk for recurrent events and deaths. The short-term effects of early treatment with statins in patients suffering from ACS on patient-relevant outcomes are unclear.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of early administered statins in patients with ACS from randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

Search Strategy

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL (to 1 February 2010). No language restrictions were applied. We supplemented the search by contacting experts in the field, by reviewing reference lists of reviews and editorials on the topic, and by searching trial registries.

Selection Criteria

RCTs comparing statins with placebo or usual care, initiation of statin therapy within 14 days following the onset of ACS, and follow-up of at least 30 days reporting at least one clinical outcome.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. We pooled treatment effects and calculated risk ratios (RRs) for all outcomes in the treatment and control groups using a random effects model.

Main Results

Eighteen studies (14,303 patients) compared early statin treatment versus placebo or usual care in patients with ACS. Compared to placebo or usual care, early statin therapy did not decrease the combined primary outcome of death, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke at one month (risk ratio (RR) 0.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.80 to 1.08) and four months (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.06) of follow-up. There were no statistically significant risk reductions from statins for total death, total MI, total stroke, cardiovascular death, revascularization procedures, and acute heart failure at one month and at four months, although there were favorable trends related to statin use for each of these endpoints. The incidence of episodes of unstable angina was significantly reduced at four months following ACS (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.96). There were nine individuals with myopathy (elevated creatinine kinase levels > 10 times the upper limit of normal) in statin treated patients (0.13%) versus one (0.015%) in the control groups. Serious muscle toxicity was mostly limited to patients treated with simvastatin 80 mg.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on available evidence, initiation of statin therapy within 14 days following ACS does not reduce death, myocardial infarction, or stroke up to four months, but reduces the occurrence of unstable angina at four months following ACS.

IMPROVE-IT figure—LDL cholesterol reduction versus clinical benefit: The hazard ratio was obtained with the use of a Cox proportional-hazards model for the reduction in major vascular events in the simvastatin–ezetimibe group as compared with the simvastatin-monotherapy group, and vertical bars indicate 1 SE. Major vascular events were defined as a composite of death from coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, stroke, or revascularization more than 30 days after randomization. In IMPROVE-IT, the between-group difference in LDL cholesterol was calculated from observed LDL cholesterol at 1 year, with imputation of the value at randomization for patients without a 1-year sample, including those who had died; letters refer to the listed trials.

Initiation of drug therapy—statin intensity and targets: Unless contraindicated, first-line drug therapy for treatment of elevated atherogenic cholesterol levels is a moderate- or high-intensity statin, and a moderate-intensity statin will generally lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) by 30% to <50% and a high-intensity statin by ≥50%, although individual patient responses should be expected to vary considerably. Some clinicians prefer to start with a high-intensity statin and reduce the dosage if the patient experiences intolerance, while others prefer to start with a moderate-intensity statin and titrate upward if additional lowering of atherogenic cholesterol is desired; if drug therapy is used, the panel consensus view was that at least a 30% reduction in atherogenic cholesterol should be targeted. Some patients have contraindications for, or intolerance to, statin therapy, and for such patients, nonstatin drug therapy may be considered.

### Study of the effectiveness of additional reductions in cholesterol and homocysteine (SEARCH): characteristics of a randomized trial among 12064 myocardial infarction survivors [^5d4061f2]. American Heart Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Cholesterol lowering with statins reduces the risk of vascular disease, but uncertainty remains as to whether more intensive statin therapy produces worthwhile benefits safely. Blood homocysteine level is an independent marker of vascular risk, but it is unknown whether this association is causal.

Methods and Results

12,064 myocardial infarction survivors have been randomized to more versus less intensive cholesterol-lowering treatment using simvastatin 80 mg versus 20 mg daily. Allocation to more intensive treatment has yielded average further low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reductions of 0.5 mmol/L at 2 months and 0.4 mmol/L at 5 years. In addition, using a factorial design, these patients have been randomized to homocysteine lowering with folic acid 2 mg plus vitamin B12 1 mg daily versus matching placebo, yielding an average 3 to 4 mumol/L reduction in homocysteine. After 6 years of median follow-up, the annual overall rate of major vascular events is approximately 3%. Follow-up is scheduled to continue for a median of 7 years.

Conclusion

SEARCH should provide reliable evidence about the efficacy and safety of prolonged use of more intensive cholesterol-lowering therapy and, separately, of folate-based homocysteine-lowering therapy in a high-risk population.

### Statin use in a "real-world" clinical setting: aggressive lipid lowering compared with usual care in the aggressive lipid-lowering initiation abates new cardiac events (ALLIANCE) trial [^cf3efcac]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Clinical trials that incorporate elements of "real-world" experience are of great value to practicing physicians. Using a trial design adapted to approximate clinical settings, the Aggressive Lipid-Lowering Initiation Abates New Cardiac Events (ALLIANCE) trial compared a focused treatment strategy using atorvastatin with usual medical care. Patients eligible for study participation were predefined based on diagnosis codes for coronary heart disease from US managed care database records; 66% of these patients were taking lipid-lowering medications at study entry. In contrast to standard clinical trials, ALLIANCE maintained a real-world environment by limiting the interactions of investigators with patients after dose titration of aggressive treatment to a low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol goal < 80 mg/dL (2.1 mmol/L) or maximum atorvastatin dose of 80 mg/day. After 51.5 months of follow-up, the study showed that aggressive treatment with atorvastatin was associated with significantly lower LDL cholesterol levels (147 mg/dL [3.8 mmol/L] to 95 mg/dL [2.5 mmol/L]) over usual care (146 mg/dL [3.8 mmol/L] to 111 mg/dL [2.9 mmol/L]). This greater reduction in LDL cholesterol was accompanied by improved outcomes in the composite primary end point of cardiovascular events (-17% with atorvastatin vs. usual care; P = 0.02) and particularly in the end point of nonfatal myocardial infarction (-47% with atorvastatin vs. usual care; P = 0.0002). No safety difference was noted between the 2 treatment groups. These results indicate that usual-care treatment was not equivalent to targeted statin therapy, even in a trial conducted to minimize potential bias owing to traditional patient selection and trial design methods.
