## Question

We are in the future, it's 2050, do we have a cure for autism?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether, in the year 2050, we have a cure for autism. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "cure" means in this context and whether that concept is ethically and clinically coherent for a neurodevelopmental condition. Then, I should verify the current state of evidence regarding treatments that modify core symptoms versus those that only address associated features. Next, I will examine the trajectory of research pipelines, including genetics, synaptic mechanisms, and early intervention, and assess their likelihood of delivering a cure by 2050. After that, I need to consider the heterogeneity of autism and how that affects the feasibility of a universal cure. Finally, I should integrate ethical and lived-experience perspectives and synthesize a cautious, reference-grounded conclusion.

> Let me first confirm the definition problem, because if I get this wrong, everything else will be off. "Cure" in medicine typically implies complete eradication of disease pathology and restoration of normal function; however, autism is a lifelong neurodevelopmental condition with heterogeneous etiologies and a developmental trajectory that begins in utero, so a literal cure would likely require reversing established brain wiring and developmental divergence, which is not currently achievable and may not be ethically acceptable to many autistic people who view autism as part of their identity rather than a disease to be eliminated [^e6e39b37] [^dcf9eaab].

> Wait, let me verify the current treatment landscape so I don't overstate anything. There are no approved medications that cure autism or reliably modify its core social communication and restrictive/repetitive behavior domains; approved pharmacotherapies like risperidone and aripiprazole target irritability and aggression, not the core syndrome, and behavioral interventions remain the mainstay with variable but meaningful improvements in functioning, not cures [^d485d07f] [^19c10f70].

> I will now examine the research trajectory that might tempt us to predict a cure. Advances in genetics have identified hundreds of risk genes and converging pathways, particularly around synaptic function and excitation–inhibition balance, and animal models of syndromic forms show phenotypic reversibility in some cases; however, translating this into safe, effective, and generalizable human therapies has been slow, and clinical trials of targeted agents remain early and limited to specific subtypes rather than idiopathic autism as a whole [^69e5dd19] [^24dfd97e] [^6fd04306].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about timelines. Even with promising translational frameworks and early signals from compounds like intranasal vasopressin or mechanism-based strategies, the field still lacks validated biomarkers for stratification, robust outcome measures for core symptoms, and a clear path to disease modification across the heterogeneous spectrum; major initiatives like EU-AIMS and contemporary reviews emphasize that we are moving toward precision approaches, but a universal cure by 2050 remains speculative rather than assured [^125c1412] [^5bf91547] [^b18aeb65].

> Let me consider heterogeneity more carefully, because this is the crux. Autism is not a single disease but a spectrum with diverse genetic architectures, neurodevelopmental timing, and phenotypic expressions; this biological and clinical heterogeneity undermines the concept of a one-size-fits-all cure and pushes the field toward stratified or personalized interventions rather than a monolithic cure, which further lowers the probability of a universal cure emerging by 2050 [^c5a44ac4] [^65588c84].

> I should double-check the ethical and lived-experience dimension before concluding. Many autistic adults reject the framing of autism as a condition needing a cure, citing identity, neurodiversity, and concerns about eugenics and selective termination; this ethical landscape shapes research priorities toward supports that enhance quality of life and functioning rather than eradication of autism itself, which materially constrains the development and social acceptance of any purported "cure" technology [^e6e39b37] [^01b71928] [^9e194d5b].

> But wait, what if early detection and intervention could effectively "prevent" autism in some cases; does that count as a cure? Early behavioral intervention improves outcomes, and there is growing interest in pre-symptomatic or neonatal strategies, yet even proponents note that complete prevention of autism-related impairments is not guaranteed and that such approaches raise ethical questions about labeling and resource allocation, reinforcing that this is not equivalent to a cure and remains controversial [^33a45286] [^62d740b7] [^d4e15f7c].

> Synthesizing this, I need to ensure my conclusion matches the weight of evidence. Given the current absence of disease-modifying therapies, the profound heterogeneity of autism, the early stage of targeted translational pipelines, and the ethical opposition to cure framing, it is highly unlikely that we will have a cure for autism by 2050; instead, the foreseeable future points toward earlier detection, stratified behavioral and pharmacologic interventions, and supports that enable autistic people to flourish on their own terms, with continued research into mechanism-based treatments for specific subtypes rather than a universal cure [^69e5dd19] [^dcf9eaab].

In 2050, **there is no cure for autism** [^notfound] because autism is a lifelong neurodevelopmental condition with diverse genetic and environmental causes [^69e5dd19] [^a4b1d5ef]. Current and emerging treatments focus on **early intervention** [^997f7a2d], behavioral therapies [^88c14678], and targeted medications for co-occurring symptoms [^250c94ed], but none reverse the core features of autism [^6fd04306]. Advances in genetics, neuromodulation, and personalized medicine may improve outcomes [^bc054e49] [^125c1412], yet a universal cure remains unlikely by 2050 [^notfound]. The field emphasizes **support, acceptance, and quality of life** [^dcf9eaab] rather than cure, aligning with neurodiversity perspectives [^e6e39b37].

---

## Current state of autism treatment

- **Behavioral interventions**: Early intensive behavioral interventions, such as applied behavior analysis (ABA) [^notfound], remain the cornerstone of autism treatment, significantly improving communication, social skills, and adaptive functioning [^notfound].

- **Pharmacological treatments**: Currently, there are no medications that cure autism or directly address its core symptoms [^250c94ed]. Medications are primarily used to manage co-occurring conditions such as anxiety, ADHD, and irritability [^9c9a6bef].

- **Genetic and personalized medicine**: Advances in genetic research have identified numerous autism risk genes [^69e5dd19], paving the way for personalized medicine approaches. However, these discoveries have not yet translated into curative therapies [^a9ba9f6e].

---

## Advances in autism research and potential future treatments

Several promising avenues of research may lead to **significant improvements** in autism management, though not necessarily a cure:

- **Gene therapy**: Techniques such as CRISPR-Cas9 [^fe6cd704] and antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) are being explored to target specific genetic mutations associated with autism [^fe6cd704]. While these approaches show potential, they are still in experimental stages and face significant ethical and technical challenges [^fe6cd704].

- **Neuromodulation**: Non-invasive brain stimulation techniques, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), are being investigated for their potential to modulate brain activity and improve social communication deficits in autism [^notfound].

- **Early detection and intervention**: Improved early detection methods, including digital biomarkers and artificial intelligence, may enable earlier intervention, potentially altering the developmental trajectory of autism [^d4e15f7c] [^f165c1ac].

---

## Ethical and societal considerations

The concept of a "cure" for autism is controversial and raises significant ethical and societal questions. Many individuals with autism and advocacy groups emphasize **neurodiversity**, arguing that autism is a natural variation of human neurology rather than a disease requiring a cure [^e6e39b37]. They advocate for acceptance, accommodation, and support rather than attempts to eliminate autism [^dcf9eaab].

---

## Projected state of autism treatment in 2050

Given current trends and advances, it is likely that by 2050, autism treatment will be characterized by:

- **Personalized interventions**: Tailored treatments based on genetic, environmental, and individual factors will become more prevalent, improving outcomes for individuals with autism [^bc054e49].

- **Enhanced early intervention**: Earlier detection and intervention will continue to improve developmental outcomes, though they will not constitute a cure [^997f7a2d].

- **Greater acceptance and inclusion**: Societal attitudes toward autism are expected to continue shifting toward acceptance and inclusion, aligning with neurodiversity principles [^dcf9eaab].

---

## Conclusion

In summary, **there will not be a cure for autism in 2050** [^c197d3cc]. Autism is a complex, lifelong neurodevelopmental condition with diverse causes, and current research focuses on improving quality of life through early intervention, behavioral therapies, and targeted treatments for co-occurring symptoms [^997f7a2d] [^88c14678] [^250c94ed]. While significant advances are expected, the concept of a cure remains unlikely and ethically contentious [^e6e39b37]. The future of autism treatment lies in personalized, evidence-based interventions that support individuals with autism to lead fulfilling lives [^bc054e49].

### Is autism curable? [^3260fefe]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder of multifactorial origin. Today, ASD is generally not curable, although it is treatable to a varying degree to prevent worse outcomes. Some reports indicate the possibility of major improvements or even recovery in ASD. However, these studies are based on scientific shortcomings, and the lack of a clear definition of 'cure' in ASD further compromises interpretation of research findings. The development of animal models and decreasing costs of genome sequencing provide new options for treatment research and individualized medicine in ASD. This article briefly reviews several issues related to the question whether there is recovery from ASD, starting with a short overview of the presumed aetiologies.

### Should newborn genetic testing for autism be introduced? [^62d740b7]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2025). Medium credibility.

Second, the current landscape of autism treatment is fraught with limited access to intervention due to several factors including a lack of effective sustainable/low-intensity intervention programmes, trained therapists, financial limitations in accessing interventions and geographical factors precluding access. Effective interventions for autismdo exist and lead to tangible gains in communication, cognitive and daily living skills in most children, but access to such interventions is a challenge in much of the world today. As such, providing timely, sustainable and effective interventions for children who are currently diagnosed with autism remains an immense challenge in most countries, both in the developed and developing world. Typical waitlists for autism treatments range from 1 to 2 years in most countries. Given this stark challenge, it is hard to posit that a healthcare system should and will be able to provide treatment for an infant or toddler who is at higher likelihood for autism based on a genetic test, in preference to older children who have been diagnosed and need treatment.

Third, current treatment options for autism entail behavioural intervention with positive but variable outcomes and do not cure or completely prevent the diagnosis. In other words, even with early and intensive behavioural intervention, it is not a given that the child will necessarily be completely well or not have any autism-related impairments in future. When coupled with the unpredictability of the exact phenotypic expression based on the genetic variant identified, this could result in an extremely stressful postnatal period for the family and caregivers of the infant in their attempts to process the information. In the scenario of an individual carrying a genetic risk variant but does not eventually manifest with the autism phenotype, knowledge of the genetic risk variant could do more harm than good. Identification of that specific genetic variant may violate the principle of non-maleficence by causing psychological harm to parents as explained above. Such information may also take resources and time away from the other siblings in the family and indirectly result in their detriment.

### Limitations of genomics to predict and treat autism: a disorder born in the womb [^1ba00dad]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2025). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, we urge researchers and practitioners to move beyond the mainstream reductive deterministic view of life that focuses too much on DNA sequence and to adopt an approach that integrates information coming from all areas of biology. This approach should consider the temporality of the onset of disorders and the dynamic basic property of brain networks to be able to detect and act before irreversible damage is done. Bringing all the resources and techniques together will require drawing on numerous scientific approaches, including epidemiology, anatomy, pathology, microbiology, physiology and developmental biology, an interdisciplinary challenge that we must meet if we are to make progress in alleviating and curing our many complex diseases.

### Therapeutic strategies for autism: targeting three levels of the central dogma of molecular biology [^a202608a]. Translational Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD) that is characterized by three core symptoms: the deficits in social interaction and communication, language development, and restrictive and repetitive behaviors. A large proportion of children diagnosed with ASD manifest additional symptoms including cognitive deficits, developmental delay, anxiety and other medical comorbidities with mood and psychiatric disorders. As of 2021, the CDC has approximated that 1 in 44, or ~2.3%, of children in the United States have ASD diagnosis.

The estimates suggest that 70% of individuals with ASD have limited ability to live independently. This lifelong dependency on caregivers as well as ASD-associated social, cognitive, and behavioral deficits can contribute to parental stress, leading to increased divorce rates in parents of ASD-diagnosed children. At a financial level, the projected cost of the resources needed to care for individuals with ASD will progressively increase to $5.54 trillion/year by 2060 due special education costs, productivity loss due to informal caretaking, and increased use of healthcare services. Given the prevalence of diagnosis, familial stress, and societal financial burden, it is imperative to develop and refine techniques to alleviate the social, cognitive, and behavioral symptoms in ASD.

### New developments in autism [^af69e0e3]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

The substantial increase in the prevalence of autism necessitates that practicing physicians become more familiar with the presentation of symptoms to improve early diagnoses and interventions, thus improving the prognosis for affected children. Autism is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder with a triad of core impairments in social interactions, repetitive behaviors, and communication. Clinically, autism appears as a spectrum, with many variations in the severity of defining behaviors and associated symptoms among children. Although the etiology of autism is unknown, it is thought to involve a genetic susceptibility that may be triggered by environmental factors. Because of the high variability in behaviors, biologic findings, and response to treatment, many specialists are assuming a theory of many different autisms, each of which may have a somewhat different etiology and response to treatment. Although there is no known cure for autism, many treatments are available to improve core and associated symptoms.

### Should newborn genetic testing for autism be introduced? [^39da4c58]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2025). Medium credibility.

Lastly, at the societal level, more widespread testing of children on the autism spectrum will enable more tailored treatment, better informed reproductive decision-making and earlier treatment, reducing costs to society. Further, it can potentially increase the scientific knowledge on the biological basis of autism and in turn, contribute to future advances in treatment in the field.

Indeed, from a distributive justice perspective, one can argue that every healthcare system should be able to provide genetic testing for autism. This includes being able to offer the tests, either locally or through international laboratories, having the necessary operational processes in place to run the tests and having trained healthcare professionals to counsel parents before and after genetic tests. Further, making genetic testing financially affordable or subsidised will be in the public interest in view of its impact not only on people on the autism spectrum, but also on their family, especially parents, and wider society.

### Editorial: addressing the "Cliff" for adults with autism spectrum disorder [^f7fff9b8]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Parents of young children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) desperately search for a cure for their child's disorder. Depending on their child's severity or lack of progress, parents shift from looking for a cure to finding arrangements where their child can live a fulfilling life as an adult when they are less involved and less able to help. Sadly, they too often find that the resources they have fought for their children to receive disappear when their youngsters leave school.

### Pharmacologic treatment of autism [^5e617e09]. Journal of Child Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

Autism is a chronic and lifelong pervasive developmental disorder for which there is yet no effective cure, and medical management remains a major challenge for clinicians. In spite of the possible similarities with conditions that have an established pharmacotherapy, and despite improvements in some associated "problematic behaviors" following the use of available medications, effective medical treatment for the core symptoms involving language and social cognition remains elusive. The purpose of the present article is to review current biologic knowledge about autism in an attempt to correlate clinical trials with known mechanisms of disease. In addition, the need for controlled studies and for the creation of homogeneous subgroups of patients based on clinical and genetic characteristics is emphasized. The application of molecular genetic investigations and pharmacogenetics in the diagnostic work-up of autistic patients can lead to more effective individualized medical care.

### Progress toward treatments for synaptic defects in autism [^6fd04306]. Nature Medicine (2013). Excellent credibility.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) encompasses a range of disorders that are characterized by social and communication deficits and repetitive behaviors. For the majority of affected individuals, the cause of ASD remains unknown, but in at least 20% of the cases, a genetic cause can be identified. There is currently no cure for ASD; however, results from mouse models indicate that some forms of the disorder could be alleviated even at the adult stage. Genes involved in ASD seem to converge on common pathways altering synaptic homeostasis. We propose, given the clinical heterogeneity of ASD, that specific 'synaptic clinical trials' should be designed and launched with the aim of establishing whether phenotype 'reversals' could also occur in humans.

### Global burden of autism spectrum disorders among population aged 70 years and older from 1990–2021, with projections to 2040: findings from the global burden of disease study 2021 [^9d49b245]. Molecular Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) is a lifelong neurodevelopmental condition that negatively affects older adults, yet it receives minimal priority and limited attention in research and healthcare services for this population. Using data from Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2021, we estimated the prevalence and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) of ASD among population aged ≥ 70 years globally from 1990–2021, with projections to 2040. Decomposition analysis was conducted. Globally, the number of ASD cases among individuals aged ≥ 70 years increased from 894.7 thousand in 1990 to 2478.9 thousand in 2021, corresponding to an increase of 177.1%, with population growth contributing to the largest increase, followed by increased age-specific prevalence rates. It is projected that by 2040, the number of cases will reach 5150.9 thousand worldwide, accounting for 864.7 thousand DALYs. Between 1990 and 2021, the prevalence rate of ASD among the older population increased by 13.2%, projecting to increase steadily by 2040. Males had a higher prevalence rate of ASD in 2021 (773.6 versus 287.8 per 100,000 people) than females. High sociodemographic index (SDI) countries had the highest rate and the greatest increase. Similar trend patterns were observed in the number of DALYs and DALY rates. To address this overlooked but increasingly severe challenge, more attention and timely development of effective interventions and management services are needed. High SDI countries should focus on developing effective intervention and treatment strategies, while middle and low SDI countries need to improve screening and diagnostic capacities and public awareness of ASD.

### Autism spectrum disorders: update of evaluation and treatment [^c66ea8e4]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2001). Low credibility.

Autistic spectrum disorders are a group of neurodevelopmental conditions that are increasingly capturing the attention of clinicians and investigators. New insights from genetics and neuropathophysiology of autism will increasingly inform treatment. Presently, individualized treatment approaches typically include a mix of behavioral and, occasionally, pharmacotherapeutic strategies. Concerning the latter, exquisite sensitivity to medication is not uncommon in some children with autism.

Unresolved controversies/research recommendations

Areas of autism management that require further research to assess their clinical and cost-effectiveness include:
A key worker approach
Group-based parent training interventions to manage behaviour that challenges
Sleep hygiene interventions or melatonin for sleep problems
Pharmacological and psychosocial interventions for comorbid anxiety
Teacher, parent and peer-mediated psychosocial interventions to manage the core symptoms of autism in preschool children.

Clinical bottom line

Although there is currently no cure for autism, much can be done to optimise quality of life for the children, young people and families affected.
This guideline takes a holistic approach to management using high quality evidence to ensure all those diagnosed with autism receive the best possible care.

### Gene hunting in autism spectrum disorder: on the path to precision medicine [^65588c84]. The Lancet: Neurology (2015). Medium credibility.

Autism spectrum disorder is typical of the majority of neuropsychiatric syndromes in that it is defined by signs and symptoms, rather than by aetiology. Not surprisingly, the causes of this complex human condition are manifold and include a substantial genetic component. Recent developments in gene-hunting technologies and methods, and the resulting plethora of genetic findings, promise to open new avenues to understanding of disease pathophysiology and to contribute to improved clinical management. Despite remarkable genetic heterogeneity, evidence is emerging for converging pathophysiology in autism spectrum disorder, but how this notion of convergent pathways will translate into therapeutics remains to be established. Leveraging genetic findings through advances in model systems and integrative genomic approaches could lead to the development of new classes of therapies and a personalised approach to treatment.

### Recent advances in understanding and managing autism spectrum disorders [^7d8567d8]. Journal of Child Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Autism spectrum disorder in children is a group of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by difficulties with social communication and behavior. Growing scientific evidence in addition to clinical practice has led the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) to categorize several disorders into the broader category of autism spectrum disorder. As more is learned about how autism spectrum disorder manifests, progress has been made toward better clinical management including earlier diagnosis, care, and when specific interventions are required. The 2014 Neurobiology of Disease in Children symposium, held in conjunction with the 43rd annual meeting of the Child Neurology Society, aimed to (1) describe the clinical concerns involving diagnosis and treatment, (2) review the current status of understanding in the pathogenesis of autism spectrum disorder, (3) discuss clinical management and therapies for autism spectrum disorder, and (4) define future directions of research. The article summarizes the presentations and includes an edited transcript of question-and-answer sessions.

### Translational approaches to the biology of autism: false dawn or a new era? [^816690f2]. Molecular Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

Discovering novel treatments for Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) is a challenge. Its etiology and pathology remain largely unknown, the condition shows wide clinical diversity, and case identification is still solely based on symptomatology. Hence clinical trials typically include samples of biologically and clinically heterogeneous individuals. 'Core deficits', that is, deficits common to all individuals with ASD, are thus inherently difficult to find. Nevertheless, recent reports suggest that new opportunities are emerging, which may help develop new treatments and biomarkers for the condition. Most important, several risk gene variants have now been identified that significantly contribute to ASD susceptibility, many linked to synaptic functioning, excitation–inhibition balance, and brain connectivity. Second, neuroimaging studies have advanced our understanding of the 'wider' neural systems underlying ASD; and significantly contributed to our knowledge of the complex neurobiology associated with the condition. Last, the recent development of powerful multivariate analytical techniques now enable us to use multi-modal information in order to develop complex 'biomarker systems', which may in the future be used to assist the behavioral diagnosis, aid patient stratification and predict response to treatment/intervention. The aim of this review is, therefore, to summarize some of these important new findings and highlight their potential significant translational value to the future of ASD research.

### The global epidemiology and health burden of the autism spectrum: findings from the global burden of disease study 2021 [^961d0b5e]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2025). High credibility.

In conclusion, GBD 2021 underlined several considerations for researchers, policy makers, and communities alike as they respond to the health burden experienced by autistic people. We estimated one in 127 individuals worldwide in 2021 was autistic, placing the autism spectrum within the top-ten causes for non-fatal health burden for children and adolescents younger than 20 years. Although the importance of early detection and intervention cannot be overstated, we must also reconsider how the service needs of autistic people evolve across the lifespan. Addressing not only the needs of autistic children and adolescents, but also those of adults, who often remain under-represented in research and service provision, is imperative. With epidemiological data only available for a limited number of global regions and countries, we urge researchers to initiate more inclusive population representative diagnostic surveys with active case finding to enhance geographical coverage. We hope that this study provides a foundation for future research and policy interventions, so that key stakeholders work to ensure that the unique needs of all autistic people are met, contributing to a better, more inclusive, and more understanding future.

### The way forward for mechanism-based therapeutics in genetically defined neurodevelopmental disorders [^8e56c485]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

Rare genetically defined neurodevelopmental disorders with increased risk of autism have recently become an entry point for autism-related drug discovery. Through exploration of downstream effects of the pathological mutations, specific mechanistic pathways have been identified as dysregulated. The identification of shared mechanisms across forms of autism opens the door for the development of novel "mechanism-based therapeutics". However, confidence in the therapeutic mechanism does not diminish the need for well-designed clinical trials.

Summary

Background

High-quality estimates of the epidemiology of the autism spectrum and the health needs of autistic people are necessary for service planners and resource allocators. Here we present the global prevalence and health burden of autism spectrum disorder from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2021 following improvements to the epidemiological data and burden estimation methods.

Methods

For GBD 2021, a systematic literature review involving searches in PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, the Global Health Data Exchange, and consultation with experts identified data on the epidemiology of autism spectrum disorder. Eligible data were used to estimate prevalence via a Bayesian meta-regression tool (DisMod-MR 2.1). Modelled prevalence and disability weights were used to estimate health burden in years lived with disability (YLDs) as the measure of non-fatal health burden and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) as the measure of overall health burden. Data by ethnicity were not available. People with lived experience of autism were involved in the design, preparation, interpretation, and writing of this Article.

Findings

An estimated 61.8 million (95% uncertainty interval 52.1–72.7) individuals (one in every 127 people) were on the autism spectrum globally in 2021. The global age-standardised prevalence was 788.3 (663.8–927.2) per 100 000 people, equivalent to 1064.7 (898.5–1245.7) autistic males per 100 000 males and 508.1 (424.6–604.3) autistic females per 100 000 females. Autism spectrum disorder accounted for 11.5 million (7.8–16.3) DALYs, equivalent to 147.6 (100.2–208.2) DALYs per 100 000 people (age-standardised) globally. At the super-region level, age-standardised DALY rates ranged from 126.5 (86.0–178.0) per 100 000 people in southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania to 204.1 (140.7–284.7) per 100 000 people in the high-income super-region. DALYs were evident across the lifespan, emerging for children younger than age 5 years (169.2 [115.0–237.4] DALYs per 100 000 people) and decreasing with age (163.4 [110.6–229.8] DALYs per 100 000 people younger than 20 years and 137.7 [93.9–194.5] DALYs per 100 000 people aged 20 years and older). Autism spectrum disorder was ranked within the top-ten causes of non-fatal health burden for people younger than 20 years.

Interpretation

The high prevalence and high rank for non-fatal health burden of autism spectrum disorder in people younger than 20 years underscore the importance of early detection and support to autistic young people and their caregivers globally. Work to improve the precision and global representation of our findings is required, starting with better global coverage of epidemiological data so that geographical variations can be better ascertained. The work presented here can guide future research efforts, and importantly, decisions concerning allocation of health services that better address the needs of all autistic individuals.

### Drug discovery for autism spectrum disorder: challenges and opportunities [^5bf91547]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2013). Medium credibility.

The rising rates of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and the lack of effective medications to treat its core symptoms have led to an increased sense of urgency to identify therapies for this group of neurodevelopmental conditions. Developing drugs for ASD, however, has been challenging because of a limited understanding of its pathophysiology, difficulties in modelling the disease in vitro and in vivo, the heterogeneity of symptoms, and the dearth of prior experience in clinical development. In the past few years these challenges have been mitigated by considerable advances in our understanding of forms of ASD caused by single-gene alterations, such as fragile X syndrome and tuberous sclerosis. In these cases we have gained insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying these conditions. In addition, they have aided in the development of animal models and compounds with the potential for disease modification in clinical development. Moreover, genetic studies are illuminating the molecular pathophysiology of ASD, and new tools such as induced pluripotent stem cells offer novel possibilities for drug screening and disease diagnostics. Finally, large-scale collaborations between academia and industry are starting to address some of the key barriers to developing drugs for ASD. Here, we propose a conceptual framework for drug discovery in ASD encompassing target identification, drug profiling and considerations for clinical trials in this novel area.

The existence of specific ASD genotypes also implies that these could be rescued (that is, 'manipulated') by specific, targeted molecular treatment. There is, therefore, now an opportunity to exploit these new findings and make progress on the development of new therapies for ASD, including both children and adults. For example, by specifically targeting CNVs of known developmental genes, efforts can be focused onto precisely those elements where these genes would be predicted to make the most impact. So far, drug discovery in ASD has also been hampered by the availability of valid human cellular assays that recapitulate normal and diseased neural function in vitro. Emerging data from both genetic and clinical studies in addition to rodent models of disease might, however, soon be used to configure cellular assays, which model the etiology of ASD. One approach being pioneered as part of a large-scale EU Innovative Medicines Initiative on Autism (EU-AIMS;) is to use induced human pluripotential stem cells from specific cohorts of patients to generate (in a culture dish) human neurons carrying the specific genotype of ASD individuals, and to examine the effect of these in mouse models. If successful, this approach will allow us to target specific aspects of neurobiology that are most atypical in ASD, rapidly 'assay' potential new treatments, and translate the findings from 'bench to bedside' (and back). Also, this approach may be used to find clusters of genotypes with similar neuronal phenotypes, which could then be used for case stratification in clinical studies and to evaluate the effect(s) of specific, targeted molecular treatment.

### The many meanings of autism: conceptual and ethical reflections [^e6e39b37]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Autism as a phenomenon has raised a plethora of ethical questions, both for clinicians and diagnosticians as well as for researchers. 1, 2, 3 For example, how should clinicians respond to the feeling sometimes expressed by certain scholars and in the media that 'too many children are given a psychiatric diagnosis nowadays'? 4 What if a child is officially in the so‐called subclinical range for autism but an autism approach would be of great benefit to the child? Should a diagnosis be withheld? Which terms should be used to explain autism to people who have recently received a diagnosis for themselves or their child? It may be helpful to use biological terminology ('a differently wired brain'), but should clinicians also convey the existing uncertainties regarding the aetiology of autism? Autism researchers and those who fund autism research may be confronted with questions related to how to set research priorities, and with sometimes incompatible views among stakeholders (parents of autistic children, adults with a diagnosis of autism, clinicians). Should research on autism be focussed on finding its biological origins, or on finding treatment? And does treatment consist of finding a 'cure' for autism for some of its more challenging behavioural expressions, or of finding better ways in which autistic people can flourish in society. Moreover, as some authors have argued, what wellbeing actually is for an 'autistic person' may very well not be the same as what wellbeing is for the more typically developing population. 5, 6 In this paper, I will use identity‐first language ('autistic person', 'autistic people'), as research suggests that this is the formulation that the majority of autistic people prefer. 7

In what follows, I will not tackle these questions as such; answering these questions presupposes that we first find a common ground about how to talk about autism. Therefore, I will first describe the conceptual challenges that ethicists face when making sense of the ethical questions surrounding autism. I will then give an overview of the normative function of biological explanations of autism in the debate. Finally, I use the idea of epigenetics, and the thinking of French medical doctor and philosopher Georges Canguilhem to suggest a non‐reductionist way of looking at autism that considers the lived experience of autistic people as scientifically relevant.

### How to diagnose autism [^8a62acce]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2007). Low credibility.

Over the past two decades, there has been an explosion of interest in autism and autism spectrum disorders. Knowledge and awareness of the condition has grown exponentially at all levels among the general public, parents, health professionals, the research community and, more recently, at parliamentary level. Alongside the increased understanding of these complex and disabling conditions is the acknowledgment of a broadening of the diagnostic criteria away from a narrow definition of autism to the autism spectrum with less clear diagnostic boundaries. Growing evidence of the importance of early diagnosis and intervention demands knowledge and skills from all professionals working with young children and in particular those involved in recognising early concerns about a child's development. This article outlines current clinical and research findings in relation to early diagnosis and considers the role of the paediatrician in this process. Reference is also made to the National Autism Plan for Children.

This is attested by anatomo-pathological signatures such as patches of cortical malformations and altered cortical columns, changes in numbers of neurons and size of brain structures. This calls for establishing reliable diagnostic methods to detect children with autism right at birth. Yet, in most developed countries, despite recommendations from both medical academies and political authorities, diagnosis is established only around 4–5 years, resulting in an apparent age of the onset of the developmental disorder around 18 months. Late detection misses the best window of opportunity for treatment and leads to a lifetime of disability that could have been substantially mitigated by early treatment (figure 3). The importance of early detection and intervention in curing children with ASD has been discussed thoroughly elsewhere.

The scheme also illustrates the relation between the timing of diagnosis and psycho-educative and drug treatment and the magnitude of deleterious sequelae. Early diagnosis and treatment are important to reduce the severity of sequelae, although a complete elimination of these is not likely to be possible for a disorder born in the womb.

### Molecular genetics of autism spectrum disorders [^475d0371]. Journal of Human Genetics (2003). Low credibility.

Autistic disorder belongs to a broad spectrum of pervasive developmental disorders. Autism is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous condition. It is characterized by impairment in a broad range of social interactions, communication, and repetitive patterns of behavior and interest. Although the exact etiology of the condition is not known, family and twin studies strongly support genetic factors in autism. Genome-wide scans suggest several susceptibility loci that may contain one or more predisposing genes. However, no such genes have been identified so far that predispose patients to autism. The condition is over 90% heritable, but the mode of inheritance is not clear. Moreover, it does not seem to be a single gene disorder. There is no cure for autism. Individualized structured education, family support services, and antipsychotic drugs are recommended. These may alleviate some behavioral problems. The identification of autism genes, an understanding of the neurobiology of the condition, and additional clinical studies may help to develop pharmacological interventions in the future.

### The foundations of autistic flourishing [^dcf9eaab]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

At the core of all good societies is an effort to enable all people to live full and flourishing lives, regardless of their background or characteristics. There has been much debate about the key elements of human flourishing, dating back to at least Aristotle, who wrote of people's need to "live well and do well" or, in short, to live a good life. Yet, remarkably, the idea of flourishing lives has rarely been applied to Autistic 1 people. Its absence, we contend, is rooted in the field's historic commitment to the conventional medical model, in which a person's functional limitations or "impairments" are the source of any disadvantages experienced, which can be remedied by treatment or cure. The absence of any meaningful discussion of flourishing could be because the challenges facing Autistic people can be substantial and lifelong, with the fundamental idea of a "good life" thus seeming out of reach. Or it might be that Autistic people have seldom been invited into the conversation about what such a good life constitutes for them, meaning that conventional accounts of human flourishing seem a long way from any putative Autistic norm. Whatever the reasons, it means that we do not know what a flourishing life might look like for Autistic people nor do we fully understand how we can help to build a foundation for such lives.

Here, our aim is not to provide a full account of Autistic flourishing. That is not our right, nor could it be achieved in a single paper. Rather, we aim here to outline a framework to help Autistic people, their families and allies, researchers, practitioners, and policymakers alike to begin a meaningful conversation about what Autistic flourishing may involve. We suggest that such understanding will require us to step away from key assumptions that have structured autism science for decades now — and to acknowledge the ways in which both hidden biases and methodological errors too often obscure understanding the key elements of Autistic flourishing. 2 In what follows below, we outline five ways in which we, as an autism research community, need to reconsider Autistic flourishing, functioning almost as a toolkit for those seeking to have conversations about such flourishing well into the future.

### Translational approaches to the biology of autism: false dawn or a new era? [^89b25949]. Molecular Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are a group of conditions in which heterogeneity, both causative and phenotypic, is emerging as a dominant theme. This poses a complex challenge to developing new treatments, and biomarkers. Also, case identification is still solely based on symptomatology (that is, impaired social communication, social reciprocity and repetitive/stereotypic behavior). Hence, clinical studies typically include samples of biologically heterogeneous cases, and this has hampered studies of clinical outcomes as well as research into the specific molecular and genetic underpinnings of the condition. However, several lines of evidence are now emerging that may unite findings from separate disciplines (for example, genetics, neuropathology and neuroimaging). These seem to converge in suggesting a common etiological pathway for ASD, namely: defective synaptic functioning, excitation–inhibition balance and brain connectivity. Further, they present new (and tractable) opportunities to identify biomarkers that can be used to fractionate the disorder and underpin the discovery of new drug targets. Here, we examine the genetic and neurobiological 'building blocks' of ASD, and suggest a pathway from abnormalities in the synapse to the formation of large-scale cortical systems (Figure 1).

### Current approaches to the pharmacologic treatment of core symptoms across the lifespan of autism spectrum disorder [^250c94ed]. Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

There are no approved medications for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) core symptoms. However, given the significant clinical need, children and adults with ASD are prescribed medication off label for core or associated conditions, sometimes based on limited evidence for effectiveness. Recent developments in the understanding of biologic basis of ASD have led to novel targets with potential to impact core symptoms, and several clinical trials are underway. Heterogeneity in course of development, co-occurring conditions, and age-related treatment response variability hampers study outcomes. Novel measures and approaches to ASD clinical trial design will help in development of effective pharmacologic treatments.

### The global epidemiology and health burden of the autism spectrum: findings from the global burden of disease study 2021 [^17fc427a]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2025). High credibility.

Fourth, the levels of severity within autism spectrum disorder were derived from a meta-analysis of studies capturing the proportion of autistic people by levels of intellectual disability. This analysis only produced an overall pooled severity distribution, with insufficient data to explore variations by location, age, or sex. We expect to see variation in the severity of health loss experienced by autistic people, for instance depending on the quality and availability of care received. New processes are under development within the GBD framework to incorporate variations in health-care access globally within disease severity. We hope to apply these processes to autism spectrum disorder in future GBD cycles.

Fifth, GBD does not yet estimate prevalence and DALYs by gender (as opposed to sex). There is emerging evidence indicating greater variation in gender diversity and sexual orientation amongst autistic people. The implications of not estimating prevalence by gender on the service needs of autistic people will not be reflected within our estimates and must be considered by service planners.

Sixth, it is important to consider the health burden experienced by autistic people that is not captured in GBD 2021. The comorbidity adjustment used within GBD assumes independent comorbidity, which underestimates the comorbidity between mental disorders in which the comorbidity distribution changes depending on the combination of disorders experienced. Autistic individuals are often at an increased risk of experiencing a range of other mental and physical health conditions compared with people who are not autistic. Additionally, although YLLs for autism spectrum disorder could not be estimated via GBD methods, there is strong evidence of an elevated risk of premature mortality within autistic people, with an increased risk of self-harm and suicide compared with the general population. In a separate analysis to GBD 2021, we explored the fatal burden attributable to the elevated risk of suicide among autistic people. We estimated 13 400 excess suicide deaths among autistic people globally in 2021, equivalent to 1.8% of all suicide deaths and 621 000 excess YLLs attributable to autism spectrum disorder. Collectively, the presence of comorbid conditions and elevated risk of mortality negatively affect the health of autistic individuals, in ways in which GBD 2021 burden estimates cannot yet quantify. This limitation needs to be addressed by future research and more importantly, through increased use of prevention, early identification, and management strategies that can mitigate the effects of comorbid health conditions and reduce the risk of mortality among autistic people.

### The global epidemiology and health burden of the autism spectrum: findings from the global burden of disease study 2021 [^60df5bc3]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2025). High credibility.

Added value of this study

This study presents updated global estimates of the prevalence and health burden of autism spectrum disorder for GBD 2021 following substantial revisions to their estimation process from previous iterations of the GBD. We present key methodological improvements in GBD 2021, such as exclusion of studies relying on passive case finding, new data from a systematic review update, and revisions to the estimation of disability weights. These updates contributed to substantial changes in the estimated prevalence and health burden of autism spectrum disorder. Globally, we estimated that one in 127 individuals in 2021 were autistic with prevalence and health burden persisting across the lifespan. Autism spectrum disorder was most common among children and adolescents younger than 20 years, for whom it ranked within the top ten causes of non-fatal health burden. Our analysis expands on the GBD 2021 capstone publication that presented the emerging trends in burden across all 371 diseases and injuries, but did not cover in detail the epidemiology and health burden of the autism spectrum.

Implications of all the available evidence

The revised estimation process and resulting prevalence and health burden estimates of autism spectrum disorder from GBD 2021 have important implications for future research, health-care provision, and policy planning. Our estimates highlight the necessity for early detection and lifelong support services for individuals on the autism spectrum. The persistence of the health burden across the lifespan demonstrates the need for policy planning and health-care provision that caters to autistic individuals at all stages of life. The limitations of our study, including the scarcity of epidemiological data, point to the need for more diagnostic surveys in many parts of the world. Our study highlights the pressing need for more comprehensive research and policy initiatives that can better meet the diverse needs of the global autistic population and improve their overall quality of life.

GBD is the largest scientific effort estimating prevalence and health burden of disorders, diseases, and injuries. Seven iterations of the GBD reporting on the autism spectrum have been completed, each quantifying the health burden using the disability-adjusted life-year (DALY). Each DALY represents a year of healthy life lost due to a cause. The term health burden in this Article refers specifically to DALY as it is used within GBD.

### Pharmacological treatment in autism: a proposal for guidelines on common co-occurring psychiatric symptoms [^e106e093]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Current ASD prevalence estimates are now 1 in 36 for children in the U.S. and in the last decade the global median prevalence of ASD children and adults is 10 per 1000. This jump in ASD rates is partly attributable to increased reporting and diagnosis, especially with the expanded Autism Spectrum Disorder diagnosis of the DSM-5. There is also evidence to suggest a true increase in global ASD occurrence, potentially relating to environmental exposures or reproductive health factors. A compelling recent BMC Medicine review outlines evidence for an array of prenatal environmental risk factors that are contributing to ASD prevalence. As we experience a rising number of new ASD patients entering the healthcare system and a growing cohort of young adults and aging adults, the limited availability of ASD specialists in the U.S. and significant disparities in access to care are raising systemic alarms. The current climate of ASD care absolutely requires that general practitioners receive the knowledge and training necessary to increase familiarity and comfort with ASD-specific prescribing practices, as referring to specialists for every case is no longer a sustainable model.

### The global epidemiology and health burden of the autism spectrum: findings from the global burden of disease study 2021 [^e78dcc3a]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2025). High credibility.

Changes in the burden of autism spectrum disorder across age highlight several considerations for how mental health services can better tailor the support available for autistic people. Given the higher burden estimated among children and adolescents, caregivers can be better supported by working closely with health professionals to monitor the development of their autistic child to jointly identify areas in which additional support is beneficial. Early intervention facilitating learning and behavioural support for young autistic children and programmes enhancing parental understanding are encouraged. School-age autistic children and adolescents could benefit from programmes addressing social communication difficulties, social skills training, or technology-based augmentative communication systems. Given the health burden of autistic spectrum disorder estimated during adulthood, autistic adults could benefit from programmes enhancing independence, such as life skills and employment training, but more research is required to identify the full range of effective services during adulthood. Despite their availability, many autistic people and their caregivers residing in high-income settings cannot access services in a timely or sustained manner, and many residing in low-income and middle-income settings cannot access these services entirely.

There are several limitations to our estimation process that need to be considered. First, we were not able to capture all variation in the prevalence and burden of autism spectrum disorder across countries, which were often presented within large and overlapping bounds of uncertainty. Our analyses were informed by epidemiological data from 34 countries (of 204) across 12 (of 21) GBD regions. Despite additional data from the review update, this method reflects a small drop in the geographical coverage from GBD 2019 due to the removal of estimates relying on passive case finding. Including estimates relying on passive case finding would improve geographical coverage; however, accurately quantifying the bias within these estimates remains challenging because of temporal and geographical heterogeneity in autism spectrum awareness, service coverage, referral pathways, and diagnostic practices. We strongly encourage researchers and other stakeholders to initiate population-representative diagnostic surveys and active case finding methods to investigate the prevalence of autism spectrum disorder, and to not rely solely on passive case finding methods, which we found can underestimate the prevalence of autism spectrum disorder within the population. These surveys should also investigate what proportion of autistic people are represented by passive case finding methods to help inform methods to incorporate existing data derived from passive case finding.

### Advancing the understanding of autism disease mechanisms through genetics [^69e5dd19]. Nature Medicine (2016). Excellent credibility.

Progress in understanding the genetic etiology of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) has fueled remarkable advances in our understanding of its potential neurobiological mechanisms. Yet, at the same time, these findings highlight extraordinary causal diversity and complexity at many levels ranging from molecules to circuits and emphasize the gaps in our current knowledge. Here we review current understanding of the genetic architecture of ASD and integrate genetic evidence, neuropathology and studies in model systems with how they inform mechanistic models of ASD pathophysiology. Despite the challenges, these advances provide a solid foundation for the development of rational, targeted molecular therapies.

### Pathways to drug development for autism spectrum disorders [^cc0836f6]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2012). Low credibility.

Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are neurodevelopmental disorders whose prevalence has risen over the past two decades. Current drug treatments for ASDs and the related disorders — fragile X syndrome (FXS) and Rett syndrome — target specific symptoms but do not address the basic underlying etiologies. However, based partly on an improved understanding of the neurochemical underpinnings of FXS, pharmacotherapy for this syndrome has progressed to the point of clinical trials of several novel drug treatments. By contrast, our overall understanding of the neuropathophysiology of ASDs is still rudimentary. There is hope in the field that knowledge and experience gained in the study of fragile X and Rett syndromes may be applicable to the larger autism patient population. In this review, we discuss how recent advances in our understanding of the biochemistry and neuropathology of these disorders could lead to new more effective treatments for ASDs.

Autism Awareness Month and World Autism Day — April 2015 — CDC highlights autism spectrum disorder (ASD) epidemiology and resources. April is Autism Awareness Month, and April 2 is World Autism Day. ASD is a developmental disability that can cause major social, communication, and behavioral challenges, with signs that begin during early childhood and usually last throughout a person's life; the cause of most cases is unknown, and there is currently no cure. CDC's most recent surveillance data indicate that about one in 68 children has been identified with ASD, which represents an almost 30% increase since the previous estimate in 2012. CDC, working with its state and academic partners, is committed to tracking changing numbers and characteristics, researching risk, and promoting early identification, and it provides information at http://www.cdc.gov/ADDM, a study page at http://www.cdc.gov/SEED, and free resources at http://www.cdc.gov/ActEarly.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) research agenda — The committee's 2009 strategic plan, updated in 2017, identified 7 areas for research funding: (1) early detection, (2) underlying biology, (3) genetic and environmental risk factors, (4) treatments and interventions, (5) services and implementation science, (6) lifespan services and supports, and (7) epidemiological surveillance and infrastructure, and research in all of these areas is critical to move forward with early diagnosis, effective treatment, and evidence-based interventions at each age. The committee recommended that multiple levels of inquiry be pursued simultaneously to inform evidence-based clinical care, including basic and translational science in the areas of genetics and epigenetics, neurobiology, and psychopharmacology to develop ASD-specific behavioral and pharmacologic therapies and to identify and understand ASD risk factors; research into the underlying neurobiology of sensory symptoms and restricted interests and repetitive behaviors to inform development of targeted interventions; clinical trials to test focused interventions based on the underlying biological processes involved with ASD to determine if they are appropriate for community application; epidemiological surveillance to gather data important for planning for current and future needs, including screening, diagnosis, and lifespan health and mental health services; and health services research to provide guidance for comprehensive, accessible, and culturally appropriate medical, educational, and behavioral care for children, youth, adults, and families affected by ASD.

Although the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is based on behavioral signs and symptoms, the evaluation of a child with ASD has become increasingly focused on the identification of the genetic etiology of the disorder. In this review, we begin with a clinical overview of ASD, highlighting the heterogeneity of the disorder. We then discuss the genetics of ASD and present updated guidelines on genetic testing. We then consider the insights gained from the identification of both single gene disorders and rare variants, with regard to clinical phenomenology and potential treatment targets.

### Attitudes of autistic adults toward genetic testing for autism [^01b71928]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2025). Medium credibility.

… While in some ways finding a genetic cause and test would be fascinating from a scientific and personal point of view I would worry about how it will be used by wider society. I feel like it will become a social engineering measure to breed autism out of the population which is a scary and undesirable prospect. Many pregnant people report being pressured to take the test for Down Syndrome. I fear the same would be true for autism.

Stated even more bluntly by a different participant:

Knowing the genetic role to being autistic doesn't help improve our lives and will lead to more discourse around "curing" autism when being autistic is not bad and doesn't need to be cured. Also, improving access to ABA should not be the goal because ABA is extremely harmful to autistic people… Autistic people don't need treatment, we need understanding and accommodations in society. The genetic counselling community should be aware of the risks for eugenics and violence that comes with searching for a genetic cause for autistic people.

### Big data approaches to decomposing heterogeneity across the autism spectrum [^f165c1ac]. Molecular Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Autism occurs in approximately 1–2% of the population and autistic individuals' mental health difficulties are a major public health issue. In economic terms, the lifetime individual cost of autism is estimated at $2.4 (£1.5) million in the United States and United Kingdom and annual population costs are around $268 billion in the United States. While interest in and science investigating autism has been growing rapidly, progress towards translating scientific knowledge into high-impact clinical practice has been small and slow in pace. We are still far from delivering more effective intervention for unwanted symptoms, more precise and earlier diagnosis, better understanding and prediction of prognosis and development, and personalization of support and intervention. All of these points are within the scope of stratified psychiatry and precision medicine. To arrive at this point, our contention is that we will first need to grapple with an important issue holding back progress — heterogeneity within the autistic population.

The field is currently addressing this issue. Some have argued that we are at a crossroad and must acknowledge that the concept of autism as a single entity lacks validity at a biological level and that autism must be taken apart. This idea relates to what others have discussed regarding autism as an umbrella label referring to many different kinds of 'autisms' and how the scientific community should abandon attempts to continue characterizing all of autism under a single theory. Research has begun along these new directions but is highly fractionated because heterogeneity is discussed across multiple levels of analysis, from genetics, neural systems, cognition, behavior and development, and clinical topics (e.g. response to treatment or outcome). Approaches differ in how heterogeneity should be decomposed, from utilizing theoretical a priori known stratifiers or dimensions to data-driven approaches. Models for understanding heterogeneity also differ, with some conceptualizing distinctions as categorical/qualitative, continuous/dimensional, and/or where distinctions or similarities may cut across diagnostic boundaries. Work can also differ with regards to aims that are specific to understanding heterogeneity within one level of analysis, while others attempt to explain heterogeneity across levels.

### The global epidemiology and health burden of the autism spectrum: findings from the global burden of disease study 2021 [^ac504e60]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2025). High credibility.

Results

DisMod-MR 2.1 was informed by 105 studies reporting 228 prevalence estimates across 33 countries and 11 of 21 regions (PRISMA diagrams in appendix 2 pp 6–7; figure 1). Most prevalence studies focused on childhood and adolescence with only six studies reporting prevalence for adults aged 20 years or older. There were six studies reporting 24 estimates of excess mortality across six countries within two regions. Eligible studies are available via the.

Figure 1
Number of studies per country used to inform the estimation of the prevalence of autism spectrum disorder

Locations coloured grey did not have eligible epidemiological data on autism spectrum disorder. Dotted lines indicate disputed territories.

The global age-standardised prevalence of autism spectrum disorder in 2021 was 788.3 (95% UI 663.8–927.2) per 100 000 people. This finding equates to 61.8 (52.1–72.7) million autistic people globally. The age-standardised prevalence in 1990 was 773.2 (651.3–914.7) per 100 000 people. In 2021 the age-standardised prevalence for males was significantly higher than for females, with 1064.7 (898.5–1245.7) autistic males per 100 000 males compared with 508.1 (424.6–604.3) autistic females per 100 000 females. Prevalence was highest at birth and decreased with age (figure 2). Between birth and age 59 years, prevalence ranged between 169.2 (115.0–237.4) per 100 000 people in children younger than 5 years to 132.0 (90.9–183.6) in adults aged 55–59 years. The rate of decline in prevalence increased from aged 60 years with prevalence ranging between 127.6 (87.8–178.2) per 100 000 people in adults aged 60–64 years and 27.9 (17.1–42.8) in adults aged 95 years and older. The estimated excess mortality among autistic people was 564.8 (474.4–666.8) per 100 000 autistic males per year and 740.1 (633.4–854.9) per 100 000 autistic females per year globally (age-standardised) in 2021.

### Immune therapy in autism: historical experience and future directions with immunomodulatory therapy [^6b1f683e]. Neurotherapeutics (2010). Low credibility.

Autism affects 1 in 110 new births, and it has no single etiology with uniform agreement. This has a significant impact on the quality of life for individuals who have been diagnosed with autism. Although autism has a spectrum quality with a shared diagnosis, it presents a uniquely different clinical appearance in each individual. Recent research of suspected immunological factors have provided more support for a probable immunological process or for processes that may play a role in the acquisition of an autistic condition. These factors include prenatal, genetic, and postnatal findings, as well as the discovery of a dysfunctional chronic pro-inflammatory state in brain tissue and cerebrospinal fluid in subsets of autistic patients. These findings offer new theories that may lead to the development of disease modification or preventative therapeutic options in the near future. This article reviews prenatal, genetic, and observed immune aspects of the autism condition that may be risk factors in the presentation of the autistic clinical phenotype. Historical immune interventions in autism are reviewed and potential new therapies and interventions are discussed.

### Incidence, prevalence, and global burden of autism spectrum disorder from 1990 to 2019 across 204 countries [^6e0c59d1]. Molecular Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) substantially contributes to the burden of mental disorders. Improved awareness and changes in diagnostic criteria of ASD may have influenced the diagnostic rates of ASD. However, while data on trends in diagnostic rates in some individual countries have been published, updated estimates of diagnostic rate trends and ASD-related disability at the global level are lacking. Here, we used the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study data to address this gap, focusing on changes in prevalence, incidence, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) of ASD across the world. From 1990 to 2019, overall age-standardized estimates remained stable globally. Both prevalence and DALYs increased in countries with high socio-demographic index (SDI). However, the age-standardized incidence decreased in some low SDI countries, indicating a need to improve awareness. The male/female ratio decreased between 1990 and 2019, possibly accounted for by increasing clinical attention to ASD in females. Our results suggest that ASD detection in low SDI countries is suboptimal, and that ASD prevention/treatment in countries with high SDI should be improved, considering the increasing prevalence of the disorder. Additionally, growing attention is being paid to ASD diagnosis in females, who might have been left behind by ASD epidemiologic and clinical research previously. ASD burden estimates are underestimated as GBD does not account for mortality in ASD.

Table 2
Age-standardised prevalence of ASD per 100 000 persons by region, super region, and globally, by sex, 2021

Autism spectrum disorder accounted for 11.5 million (95% UI 7.8–16.3) DALYs globally in 2021. Because of population growth, the DALYs attributable to autism spectrum disorder has increased from 7.9 million (5.4–11.1) DALYs globally in 1990. However, the age-standardised DALY rate remained largely unchanged between 1990 (144.5 [98.3–203.3] per 100 000 people) and 2021 (147.6 [100.2–208.2] DALYs per 100 000 people). In 2021 the age-standardised DALY rate varied significantly by sex, with 199.8 (136.3–282.0) DALYs per 100 000 males compared with 94.5 (64.5–133.0) DALYs per 100 000 females.

The age and geographical distribution of DALYs mirrored that of prevalence. DALYs emerged for children younger than age 5 years (169.2 [95% UI 115.0–237.4] DALYs per 100 000 people for children younger than 1 year) then decreased with age (163.4 [110.6–229.8] DALYs per 100 000 people younger than 20 years and 137.7 [93.9–194.5] per 100 000 people aged 20 years and older). At the super-region level, age-standardised DALY rates ranged from 126.5 (95% UI 86.0–178.0) per 100 000 people in southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania to 204.1 (140.7–284.7) per 100 000 people in the high-income super-region. At the region level, age-standardised DALY rates ranged between 114.4 (77.1–160.3) per 100 000 people in tropical Latin America and 293.9 (203.2–413.0) per 100 000 people in high-income Asia Pacific. The lowest age-standardised DALY rate was estimated for Bangladesh (110.3 [75.4–154.6] per 100 000 people), whereas the highest was estimated for Japan (299.1 [207.2–420.0] per 100 000 people; figure 3; appendix 2 pp 50–60).

### Functional and molecular characterization of a non-human primate model of autism spectrum disorder shows similarity with the human disease [^9c2f263c]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a highly prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder that affects > 1% of the population, of which 85% are idiopathic with no direct evidence of specific genetic causes. ASD is characterized by impaired social interaction and communication, repetitive behaviors, and restricted interests. Currently, its core symptoms cannot be cured and there is a need to develop pharmacological therapy. People with ASD typically show delayed development of social and language skills and are diagnosed at ~3 years old. However, early behavioral signs are predictive of pre-existing abnormalities in circuit development. Early behavioral intervention is recommended for children diagnosed with ASD, and better outcomes are expected if it is started earlier. Thus, there is an urgent need to identify biological abnormalities both to understand the pathogenesis and to develop effective pharmacological treatments that can be started during the early developmental stage.

### What the DSM-5 portends for research, diagnosis, and treatment of autism spectrum disorders [^75728b5f]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2012). Low credibility.

In May 2013 the APA will release DSM-5, which will restructure the diagnostic classification for autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) into a single category. The proposed changes in DSM-5 aim to better reflect the current state of research by consistently identifying the core features in social/communication and restrictive and repetitive behaviors that are specific to ASDs. This review describes the empirical and theoretical bases of research in the nosology of ASDs, given the impending shift in DSM-5 diagnostic criteria. General issues in diagnosis and prevalence are described, with differences between DSM-IV and DSM-5 highlighted. To address concerns about the application of the proposed DSM-5 criteria, the current literature assessing the sensitivity and specificity of the proposed DSM-5 criteria is reviewed. Last, we discuss the implications of the changes in DSM-5 for the treatment of ASDs and recommend areas for future research.

### Translational approaches to the biology of autism: false dawn or a new era? [^b107b27f]. Molecular Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Over the last decade, the behavioral diagnosis of ASD has been invaluable in the clinical setting, as it can accommodate all variations of the ASD spectrum, regardless of their etiology. However, for any biologist (geneticist or neuroscientist) trying to solve what is often referred to as the 'puzzle of neurobiology' in ASD, starting with the behavioral phenotype, represents a heuristic challenge, which can only be compared with solving an inverse problem. However, new approaches to genotype clustering and the identification of their common functional pathways may enable us in the future to find comparable (that is, homogenous) groups of individuals with ASD, which can be combined in order to elucidate their common underlying neurobiology. Given the genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity of ASD, neither 'top-down' clinical and translational studies, nor 'bottom-up' model system analysis are therefore likely to impact on ASD alone. Rather, we need to integrate proven technologies around animal models, cellular assays, together with new analytical approaches in clinical populations to elucidate the complex etiology and phenotype of the condition. Recent animal and postmortem studies are important steps forward in this quest. For example, recent workdemonstrate how causal interactions between geno- and phenotype can be established by means of active genetic manipulation. Furthermore, the discovery of multiple, specific ASD genotypes implies that these may be rescued (that is, 'manipulated') by specific, targeted molecular treatment. There is therefore now an opportunity to exploit these new findings and make progress on the development of new therapies for ASD, including both children and adults. There is no doubt that advances in genetic and imaging technologies offer promising new ways of finding biomarkers and/or treatment targets for ASD. If successful, these new approaches may one day prove invaluable in diagnosis, treating and characterizing ASD.

### Lessons learned from studying syndromic autism spectrum disorders [^24dfd97e]. Nature Neuroscience (2016). Medium credibility.

Syndromic autism spectrum disorders represent a group of childhood neurological conditions, typically associated with chromosomal abnormalities or mutations in a single gene. The discovery of their genetic causes has increased our understanding of the molecular pathways critical for normal cognitive and social development. Human studies have revealed that the brain is particularly sensitive to changes in dosage of various proteins from transcriptional and translational regulators to synaptic proteins. Investigations of these disorders in animals have shed light on previously unknown pathogenic mechanisms leading to the identification of potential targets for therapeutic intervention. The demonstration of reversibility of several phenotypes in adult mice is encouraging, and brings hope that with novel therapies, skills and functionality might improve in affected children and young adults. As new research reveals points of convergence between syndromic and nonsyndromic autism spectrum disorders, we believe there will be opportunities for shared therapeutics for this class of conditions.

### Autism and the environment: challenges and opportunities for research [^a4b1d5ef]. Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Autism spectrum disorder is a complex developmental disorder that dramatically affects the lives of patients and their families and the broader community. The causes of autism are unknown; however, evidence increasingly suggests that a complex interplay among environmental stressors, genetic mutations, and other biological factors likely plays a significant role in the development and/or progression of autism spectrum disorder. On April 18 and 19, 2007, the Institute of Medicine's Forum on Neuroscience and Nervous System Disorders hosted a workshop to provide a venue to bring together scientists; major sponsors of autism-related research; and members of the autism patient, family, and advocacy community to discuss the most promising and urgent scientific questions and opportunities. Broad participation by the autism community enriched the meeting significantly by contributing a valuable and personal perspective that is often missing from scientific meetings. It also began a much improved public-private partnership in which all stakeholders are represented. On the basis of the presentations and the discussions that followed, an array of important scientific opportunities were identified in 5 general categories: (1) opportunities to advance clinical research; (2) opportunities to enhance epidemiologic studies; (3) opportunities to improve the understanding of autism's pathology and etiology; (4) tools and infrastructure needs; and (5) opportunities for public-private partnerships. This workshop demonstrated that full public engagement can greatly enhance activities such as this workshop and its outcomes. Furthermore, we expect that this listing of scientific challenges, needs, and opportunities will help to frame a more comprehensive research agenda.

### Defining cure [^bcb17747]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2011). Low credibility.

This paper is a summary of the presentations made as Proposal 2-"Defining cure" to the 2nd Annual meeting of the ICI-Research Society, in Bristol, 16th June 2010. It reviews definitions of 'cure' and 'outcome', and considers the impact that varying definition may have on prevalence studies and cure rates. The difference between subjective and objective outcomes is considered, and the significance that these different outcomes may have for different stakeholders (e.g. clinicians, patients, carers, industry etc.) is discussed. The development of patient reported outcome measures and patient defined goals is reviewed, and consideration given to the use of composite end-points. A series of proposals are made by authors and discussants as to how currently validated outcomes should be applied, and where our future research activity in this area might be directed.

### Risk factors for autism: translating genomic discoveries into diagnostics [^8363be5e]. Human Genetics (2011). Low credibility.

Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are a group of conditions characterized by impairments in communication and reciprocal social interaction, and the presence of restricted and repetitive behaviors. The spectrum of autistic features is variable, with severity of symptoms ranging from mild to severe, sometimes with poor clinical outcomes. Twin and family studies indicate a strong genetic basis for ASD susceptibility. Recent progress in defining rare highly penetrant mutations and copy number variations as ASD risk factors has prompted early uptake of these research findings into clinical diagnostics, with microarrays becoming a 'standard of care' test for any ASD diagnostic work-up. The ever-changing landscape of the generation of genomic data coupled with the vast heterogeneity in cause and expression of ASDs (further influenced by issues of penetrance, variable expressivity, multigenic inheritance and ascertainment) creates complexity that demands careful consideration of how to apply this knowledge. Here, we discuss the scientific, ethical, policy and communication aspects of translating the new discoveries into clinical and diagnostic tools for promoting the well-being of individuals and families with ASDs.

### Developing new pharmacotherapies for autism [^8fe1b336]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Developing new pharmacotherapies for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a challenge. ASD has a complex genetic architecture, several neurobiological phenotypes and multiple symptom domains. However, new opportunities are emerging that could lead to the development of 'targeted' and individualized pharmacological interventions. Here, first we review these important new insights into the aetiology and neurobiology of ASD with particular focus on (i) genetic variants mediating synaptic structure and functioning and (ii) differences in brain anatomy, chemistry and connectivity in this condition. The characterization of the genotypic and phenotypic differences underlying ASD might in the future be invaluable for stratifying the large range of different individuals on the autism spectrum into genetically and/or biologically homogeneous subgroups that might respond to similar targeted interventions. Secondly, we propose a strategic framework for the development of targeted pharmacotherapies for ASD, which comprises several different stages in which research findings are translated into clinical applications. The establishment of animal models and cellular assays is important for developing and testing new pharmacological targets before initiating large-scale clinical trials. Finally, we present the European Autism Interventions - A Multicentre Study for Developing New Medications (EU-AIMS) Initiative, which was set up in the context of the EU Innovative Medicines Initiative as the first European platform for integrated translational research in ASD. The EU-AIMS Initiative consists of academic and industrial partners working in collaboration to deliver a more 'personalized' approach to diagnosing and treating ASD in the future.

### New models for considering the role of medication in the treatment and elucidation of the etiology of autism [^922f3515]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2012). Low credibility.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a lifelong neurodevelopmental disorder. Over the past decades, much research has been conducted to elucidate a single etiological factor and effective pharmacotherapuetics to address the core symptom domains of ASD with limited success. Research has changed focus from behavioral observations of ASD to translating findings from animal models, genomic manipulation studies and basic science studies to pharmacological agents with the aim to lessen or reverse core symptoms of ASD. This paper evaluates potential models for translating information from the biology of ASD to pharmacological treatments.

### Autism spectrum disorder genetics and the search for pathological mechanisms [^97a86b58]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Recent progress in the identification of genes and genomic regions contributing to autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has had a broad impact on our understanding of the nature of genetic risk for a range of psychiatric disorders, on our understanding of ASD biology, and on defining the key challenges now facing the field in efforts to translate gene discovery into an actionable understanding of pathology. While these advances have not yet had a transformative impact on clinical practice, there is nonetheless cause for real optimism: reliable lists of risk genes are large and growing rapidly; the identified encoded proteins have already begun to point to a relatively small number of areas of biology, where parallel advances in neuroscience and functional genomics are yielding profound insights; there is strong evidence pointing to mid-fetal prefrontal cortical development as one nexus of vulnerability for some of the largest-effect ASD risk genes; and there are multiple plausible paths forward toward rational therapeutics development that, while admittedly challenging, constitute fundamental departures from what was possible prior to the era of successful gene discovery.

### The global epidemiology and health burden of the autism spectrum: findings from the global burden of disease study 2021 [^7ce9bc26]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

This Article presents global estimates of prevalence and health burden for the autism spectrum from GBD 2021, following revision to the estimation process. In 2021, one in 127 people globally were estimated to be autistic, substantially higher than the one in 271 estimated by GBD 2019. This difference is mainly attributed to the change in GBD methods, with the exclusion of studies relying on passive case finding (eg, registry or administrative prevalence estimates) that probably underestimated the prevalence of the autism spectrum. The large increase in the estimated prevalence of the autism spectrum reflects necessary improvements in its epidemiological modelling and aligns global estimates with estimates derived from high-quality epidemiological surveys.

Despite the increase in prevalence of autism spectrum disorder in GBD 2021 compared with GBD 2019, the prevalence of autism spectrum disorder e stimated for the USA remains more conservative than findings from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that indicate that one in 36 children aged 8 years in the USA were autistic in 2020. This higher prevalence was derived from a review of case notes from clinical and educational records to establish whether individuals likely met diagnostic criteria for probable autism spectrum disorder. Because individuals were not clinically evaluated for autism spectrum disorder (as is done in population diagnostic surveys), this method can overestimate the prevalence of autism spectrum disorder.

The prevalence and DALYs attributable to autism spectrum disorder in GBD 2021 were higher in males than in females, with a global age-standardised sex ratio of 2.1 to 1. The removal of prevalence data relying on passive case finding resulted in a substantial decrease in the estimated sex ratio. This result was consistent with a previous meta-analysis which showed that studies reporting registry and administrative prevalence produced a substantially higher sex ratio than studies relying on active case finding. This meta-analysis illustrated a potential sex bias for receiving diagnoses of autism spectrum disorder and, together with our findings, highlights the need for more consideration into how screening procedures and services can be altered to ensure that both autistic female and male individuals receive support. However, there are caveats to the age-standardised global sex ratio estimated by DisMod-MR 2.1. Data-rich regions tended to have higher sex ratios than regions with minimal or no data informing prevalence. For data-sparce locations (eg, in sub-Saharan Africa), the sex ratio in prevalence was more conservative, contributing to a lower sex ratio. This area is one of ongoing review as more sex-specific prevalence estimates across more geographical locations become available.

### The global epidemiology and health burden of the autism spectrum: findings from the global burden of disease study 2021 [^294e2577]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2025). High credibility.

The global age-standardised prevalence of the autism spectrum reported by GBD 2019 was 369.4 per 100 000 people, which was relatively low compared with the prevalence of autism spectrum disorder from active case-finding methods (in which prevalence is estimated using a diagnostic instrument in a general population survey supplemented by a search in case registries or special education facilities). This low prevalence was largely attributed to the incorporation of estimates relying on passive case finding (in which prevalence is estimated using the number of pre-existing diagnoses identified through databases such as administrative or educational records). This type of prevalence estimation relies on autistic people being correctly identified through existing health-care practices within the population, which have historically underestimated prevalence. Bias corrections for these studies were implemented, but a method to incorporate how this bias varies by geography and time was not possible given the scarce available data reporting the proportion of autistic people represented using passive case-finding methods. For GBD 2021, estimates that made use of passive case finding were removed from the epidemiological modelling. This change, together with new data and revisions to the estimation of disability weights, has substantially changed estimates of the prevalence and health burden of autism spectrum disorder. These findings therefore supersede those from GBD 2019 and all previous GBD iterations. This Article summarises the revised process for estimating the prevalence and DALYs of autism spectrum disorder in 2021 and presents an overview of the prevalence and DALYs by age, sex, and geography. This Article was produced as part of the GBD Collaborator Network and in accordance with the GBD protocol.

Despite the remarkable number of scientific breakthroughs of the last 100 years, the treatment of neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g. autism spectrum disorder, intellectual disability) remains a great challenge. Recent advancements in genomics, such as whole-exome or whole-genome sequencing, have enabled scientists to identify numerous mutations underlying neurodevelopmental disorders. Given the few hundred risk genes that have been discovered, the etiological variability and the heterogeneous clinical presentation, the need for genotype — along with phenotype-based diagnosis of individual patients has become a requisite. In this review we look at recent advancements in genomic analysis and their translation into clinical practice.

### Autism spectrum disorder: incidence and time trends over two decades in a population-based birth cohort [^8879f453]. Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on autism spectrum disorder:

- **Definition**: ASD comprises a heterogeneous group of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by early-onset deficits in social communication as well as restricted and repetitive interests and behaviors.
- **Pathophysiology**: ASD is associated with alterations in brain connectivity resulting from a complex interaction of genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of ASD in the US is estimated at 1,250–2,410 persons per 100,000 population.
- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations include developmental delay, deficits in social interaction, communication, and repetitive/restricted behaviors. Approximately 75% of patients with ASD have comorbid psychiatric conditions including anxiety, depression, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, and Tourette syndrome.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Individuals with ASD have an estimated excess mortality rate ratio of 5.6. Associated medical disorders (including epilepsy with cognitive impairment) and accidents account for most of the deaths.

### Delivering paediatric precision medicine: genomic and environmental considerations along the causal pathway of childhood neurodevelopmental disorders [^7b629282]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

In this age of emerging genetic and molecular therapies making previously untreatable disorders potentially treatable, never has it been more important to determine and expand on the 'causes' of disease, and the 'contributors' to severity and functional impairment beyond the genome. Targeting the cumulative interaction of genetic and environmental specific aetiological and pathophysiological pathways is inherently logical and reflects the lived experience of a child with a neurodevelopmental disorder. An integrated biopsychosocial model will further our understanding of causal pathways and the development of novel therapeutic approaches. It should inform all areas of discovery research, including driving grant funding and collaboration. To not do this runs the risk of an inequitable, ineffective, and inefficient translation of research findings for children with neurodevelopmental disorders and their families.

### Lost in translation: traversing the complex path from genomics to therapeutics in autism spectrum disorder [^a9ba9f6e]. Neuron (2018). Low credibility.

Recent progress in the genomics of non-syndromic autism spectrum disorder (nsASD) highlights rare, large-effect, germline, heterozygous de novo coding mutations. This distinguishes nsASD from later-onset psychiatric disorders where gene discovery efforts have predominantly yielded common alleles of small effect. These differences point to distinctive opportunities for clarifying the neurobiology of nsASD and developing novel treatments. We argue that the path ahead also presents key challenges, including distinguishing human pathophysiology from the potentially pleiotropic neurobiology mediated by established risk genes. We present our view of some of the conceptual limitations of traditional studies of model organisms, suggest a strategy focused on investigating the convergence of multiple nsASD genes, and propose that the detailed characterization of the molecular and cellular landscapes of developing human brain is essential to illuminate disease mechanisms. Finally, we address how recent advances are leading to novel strategies for therapeutics that target various points along the path from genes to behavior.

### Cell therapy for diverse central nervous system disorders: inherited metabolic diseases and autism [^35daec31]. Pediatric Research (2018). Low credibility.

The concept of utilizing human cells for the treatment of medical conditions is not new. In its simplest form, blood product transfusion as treatment of severe hemorrhage has been practiced since the 1800s. The advent of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) began with the development of bone marrow transplantation for hematological malignancies in the mid-1900s and is now the standard of care for many hematological disorders. In the past few decades, HSCT has expanded to additional sources of donor cells, a wider range of indications, and the development of novel cell products. This trajectory has sparked a rapidly growing interest in the pursuit of innovative cell therapies to treat presently incurable diseases, including neurological conditions. HSCT is currently an established therapy for certain neurologically devastating inherited metabolic diseases, in which engrafting donor cells provide lifelong enzyme replacement that prevents neurological deterioration and significantly extends the lives of affected children. Knowledge gained from the treatment of these rare conditions has led to refinement of the indications and timing of HSCT, the study of additional cellular products and techniques to address its limitations, and the investigation of cellular therapies without transplantation to treat more common neurological conditions, such as autism spectrum disorder.

### The autism treatment network: bringing best practices to all children with autism [^d874405b]. Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

The Autism Treatment Network and Autism Intervention Research Network on Physical Health were established in 2008 with goals of improving understanding of the medical aspects of autism spectrum disorders. Over the past decade, the combined network has conducted > 2 dozen clinical studies, established clinical pathways for best practice, developed tool kits for professionals and families to support better care, and disseminated these works through numerous presentations at scientific meetings and publications in medical journals. As the joint network enters its second decade continuing this work, it is undergoing a transformation to increase these activities and accelerate their incorporation into clinical care at the primary care and specialty care levels. In this article, we describe the past accomplishments and present activities. We also outline planned undertakings such as the establishment of the Autism Learning Health Network, the increasing role of family members as co-producers of the work of the network, the growth of clinical trials activities with funding from foundations and industry, and expansion of work with primary care practices and autism specialty centers. We also discuss the challenges of supporting network activities and potential solutions to sustain the network.

### An update on psychopharmacological treatment of autism spectrum disorder [^19c10f70]. Neurotherapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

Classic medical management of medical conditions has largely revolved around pharmacological treatment. However, despite decades of research in ASD, current evidence has only established behavioral (non-pharmacological) treatments as the mainstay of management to address the core symptoms of ASD. Part of the reason for a lack of efficacy in many treatment studies stems from the heterogeneous etiology underlying the overall term of ASD. Some studies have subdivided enrolled patients either by their genetic etiology or phenotypic features to address this. The aim of this paper is to provide a current update on the pharmacological treatments available for ASD and therapeutic subtypes of ASD, covering both the established ones and upcoming/emerging treatments which have potential based on scientific evidence to become standard treatments in the next few years. A systematic literature search was completed on Medline, Scopus, and Embase with key search terms of "autism", "autism spectrum disorder", "targeted treatments", "pharmacological therapy", and "management" to identify relevant articles. Here we have highlighted the psychopharmacological treatments that have the most efficacy and are also, in most cases, available now or in the near future to clinicians. However, we also recognize the current mainstay of behavioral intervention in the management of ASD and will briefly review those which are supported by strong empirical evidence.

### Finding more constructive ways forward in the debate over vaccines with increased disability cultural competence [^ff3a9aeb]. Medical Humanities (2023). Medium credibility.

The societal problem narrative further suggests that autism is a personal death and a societal one. In the immunisation context, it is not unusual to express worry about the rising numbers of children with autism, followed by a comment about how this is going to destroy the world or be disastrous to society. The implication of this is that autism is perceived as a problem to be dealt with in the present if the future is to be saved. Andrew Wakefield and Del Bigtree, who are two key figures in today's antivaccination movement in the USA and beyond, frequently stress that the rising number of autism is going to be the end of society. Hence, the societal problem narrative is truly at the core of present-day antivaccination rhetoric.

The preventative narrative represents examples of when autism is discussed as something to be prevented. Here, prevention is synonymous to the desire for a future without autism. Many articles speak to medical solutions that may prevent autism entirely, thus fitting well into the goal of curing rather than caring common in modern medicine. This is an occurring phenomenon in other medical contexts as well, but not only in a rhetorical manner. The introduction of prenatal testing, for instance, was motivated on the grounds of prevention. That is prevention from future costs and prevention from suffering, an elaborate way of saying that children with disabilities are not wanted. In the immunisation context, this is further exemplified in articles that aim to debunk misinformation about the vaccine-autism link with possible ways to reduce autism in the future.

### The global epidemiology and health burden of the autism spectrum: findings from the global burden of disease study 2021 [^83609a63]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2025). High credibility.

Prevalence varied substantially by region, from one in 163 people in tropical Latin America to one in 65 people in high-income Asia Pacific. The high prevalence in high-income Asia Pacific was driven by high-quality data from South Korea and Japan indicating high prevalence in this region. There are many factors contributing to the geographical variation in prevalence, including varying exposure to risk factors, cultural variation in behavioural norms, validity and choice of screening and diagnostic tools, participants' responses to survey questions, or even their choice to participate.

Prevalence did not vary substantially over time. Studies reporting an increase in the prevalence of the autism spectrum have often relied on registries or administrative records to determine prevalence. Studies using random sampling or consistent active-case finding did not show this trend. This finding aligns with previous work suggesting autistic characteristics in the population have remained stable over time despite a rise in registered diagnoses. Nonetheless, the absence of temporal trends in our analysis should be interpreted with caution as we relied on a 15-year time window (reduced from 25 years) to model prevalence data. This time window might have limited our ability to explore temporal trends, but a further reduction was not possible because of data sparsity.

Autism spectrum disorder ranked within the top-ten causes of non-fatal health burden for young people (age < 20 years), emphasising the need for early detection and developmental support for autistic people. Most epidemiological investigations into the autism spectrum have been predominantly centred on children and adolescents, leaving a gap in our understanding of the autism spectrum in adults. The prevalence and health burden of autism spectrum disorder persisted across the lifespan, beginning to decline from age 60 years. DisMod MR 2.1 estimated prevalence while also taking into consideration data available from other epidemiological parameters. In this case, with most of our raw prevalence data limited to younger cohorts, the age pattern in prevalence was informed by excess mortality data modelled by DisMod-MR 2.1 because of limited available prevalence data in adulthood. Because of limited data availability, all mortality data sourced from the systematic review relied on passive case finding (eg, from administrative records). This method might overestimate excess mortality for all autistic people, leading to an underestimation of prevalence in adulthood.

### Secretin for the treatment of autism [^830d48ab]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the role of secretin in the treatment of children with autism.

Data Source

Literature was assessed through MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIOSIS (November 1998-August 2001), and the World Wide Web. Literature included scientific studies, anecdotal reports, and meeting abstracts. Key search terms included autism and secretin.

Data Synthesis

Autism is a pervasive developmental disorder. Although several treatments exist, no cure has been identified. New information suggests that secretin may be beneficial for this disorder. A critical evaluation of current information about the use of secretin in autism was conducted.

Conclusions

Currently, several anecdotal reports and a few controlled trials with conflicting results have been published regarding the use of secretin in autism. Further studies should be conducted to determine the safety and efficacy of secretin for autism.

### FDA takes action to make a treatment available for autism symptoms… [^700fd89a]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

- **For Immediate Release**: The U. S. Food and Drug Administration today initiated the approval of leucovorin calcium tablets for patients with cerebral folate deficiency, a neurological condition that affects folate transport into the brain. Individuals with cerebral folate deficiency have been observed to have developmental delays with autistic features, seizures, and problems with movement and coordination. The FDA has conducted a systematic analysis of literature published between 2009–2024, including published case reports with patient-level information, as well as mechanistic data, and has determined that the information supports a finding that leucovorin calcium can help individuals suffering from CFD. "We have witnessed a tragic four-fold increase in autism over two decades, ". said FDA Commissioner Marty Makary, M. D. M. P. H.

"Children are suffering and deserve access to potential treatments that have shown promise. We are using gold standard science and common sense to deliver for the American people". The FDA is working with GSK, the innovator of Wellcovorin, on a process to include the essential scientific information needed for the safe and effective use of these drug products for adults and pediatric patients with CFD. As the New Drug Application holder for this medicine, GSK has preliminarily agreed to work with the FDA on this relabeling effort. "The FDA is collaborating with GSK to broaden the existing Wellcovorin label, " said George Tidmarsh, M. D. Ph. D. Director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. "This effort reflects the FDA's commitment to identify opportunities to repurpose drugs to treat chronic diseases. The FDA remains committed to finding and treating the root causes of autism".

CFD has also been reported in a broader patient population with neuropsychiatric symptoms, including autistic features, and detectable serum autoantibodies to the folate receptor alpha; however, there are limitations on the available data for the use of leucovorin in this population and additional studies are needed to assess safety and efficacy. The FDA, an agency within the U. S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation's food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, radiation-emitting electronic products, and for regulating tobacco products.

Second, it was difficult to quantify the amount of variation due to true differences in prevalence or due to other methodological differences between studies. We adjusted for differences in case definition and sampling methods through bias corrections, but acknowledge that these adjustments represent a small sample of the between-study variation in methods. Studies differed in screening and diagnostic tools used, tool thresholds, and methods for accounting for non-response. These are avenues for future work to better respond to remaining biases within the epidemiological data.

Third, disability weights in GBD do not vary by location and are generated by the reactions of survey participants to lay descriptions of relevant health states. A separate analysis of GBD disability weights indicated that they remained relatively stable across locations; however this work was limited to the nine countries in which disability weights surveys were done. Additionally, for the autism spectrum, the lay descriptions used in these surveys could be considered simplistic, incomplete, and potentially stigmatising for autistic people. Many autistic people might embrace their diagnosis as an essential part of their identity and object to the view that their diagnosis is a disability or disorder. Regardless, many autistic people still require support and services, which are frequently delayed or unavailable. Without disability weights and subsequent DALY estimates, there is a risk of inadequate prioritisation of these essential resources for autistic people. Previous work suggests that lay people from the general public provide the most balanced responses when evaluating lay descriptions of health states, as respondents tend to underestimate the disability of their health states. Future disability-weight surveys should consider generating lay descriptions and disability weights for the autism spectrum derived in consultation with autistic people to adequately capture the disability and service needs of this population.

### Stem cell therapies in cerebral palsy and autism spectrum disorder [^0121a3be]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Across disciplines, there is great anticipation that evolving cell therapies may finally provide a therapeutic option for conditions in dire need. These conditions are typically complex and their pathophysiology incompletely understood, hindering the development of robust preclinical models and the precise assessment of therapeutic effects in human studies. This article provides an overview of the status of cell therapy investigations in two common neurodevelopmental disorders, cerebral palsy and autism spectrum disorder. Challenges facing this line of study, including inherent heterogeneity, knowledge gaps, and unrealistic expectations, are discussed. Much progress has been made in the past decade, but to definitively determine if cell therapies have a role in the treatment of neurodevelopmental disorders, both fields will need to evolve together. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: The safety profile of reported cell therapies in children with neurodevelopmental disorders is encouraging. Efficacy trials in cerebral palsy and autism spectrum disorder are ongoing in the United States and Asia. Unresolved issues pertain to the properties of the cells being studied and the characteristics of the neurodevelopmental conditions themselves.

### Attitudes of autistic adults toward genetic testing for autism [^9e194d5b]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2025). Medium credibility.

I have concerns that increased genetic testing for autism may lead to selective termination or curative approaches. I am more interested in genetic answers to conditions such as EDS (Ehlers‐Danlos syndrome), which are known to be genetic and that frequently co‐occur with autism.

And another wrote:

I think for syndromic autism it is very valuable. However, autism that is not connected to other developmental syndromes or intellectual disability doesn't strongly benefit from genetic testing. I believe that most autism is from epigenetic factors and therefore there is no one gene that is going to say if someone has autism. Additionally I think pursuing a gene for autism could invalidate a lot of autistic people who may not have the same mutation.

Prioritizing the autistic community's needs was another common thread by our respondents with one sharing:

There is no need for genetic testing in autism. What is most important is that we have community members we can connect with, but a genetic test does not help us form that community. The core features of autism… are [what help] me connect with other autistics, not the shared genetic markers. I worry that genetic testing for autism will further pathologize the condition and lead to increased stigmatization.

And another expressing:

I understand autism as a framework for how a person thinks/behaves rather than a disorder that needs to be cured. Overall, I feel that educating parents/community members about autism through the social model of disability is invaluable and should be prioritized over preventing autism.

Lastly, a sizable number of autistic participants objected outright to genetic testing in principle, expressing variants of the perspective that any investigation into the cause(s) of autism would be inevitably tied to discrimination against autistic people, selective abortion based on testing results, and/or additional discourse around treating/curing autism, which they fundamentally disagreed with. These perspectives varied in the strength of their opposition and whether or not they additionally mentioned behavioral autism interventions as something they additionally felt was harmful or fundamentally wrong (see Chapman & Bovell; Graber & Graber, for more on this issue).

### An update on pharmacologic treatments for autism spectrum disorders [^de50c40c]. Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Increasingly recognized over the past 20 years, autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are heterogeneous. Medication treatments remain fundamentally ameliorative, so prioritizing symptoms and matching medications to the patient's constellation of symptoms remains the psychopharmacologic approach to ASD. Atypical antipsychotic medications and glutamatergic agents are receiving increased attention, and antidepressants are being examined for specific symptoms and for younger patients who have autism. Large multisite networks (Research Units on Pediatric Psychopharmacology; Studies to Advance Autism Research and Treatment) have been constructed to expedite studies to elucidate effective treatments for ASD. Findings from these networks are coupled with those from recent independent trials.

This article critically reviews research done in the past 2 years concerning the pathophysiology and treatment of autism. Recent research in genetics, neuroimaging, neurochemistry, and pharmacologic treatment has advanced the body of knowledge about the pathophysiology of autism. Relatively new imaging technologies (eg, positron emission tomography) are increasingly being applied to the study of subjects with autism and have produced promising results that await replication. Neurochemical and challenge studies continue to suggest a role for 5-HT dysregulation in autism. Additional research is needed to determine the role of neuroendocrine and autoimmune factors in autism. Significant gains have been made in determining which pharmacologic treatments are efficacious in autism. Additional research is needed on agents that might ameliorate the core and associated symptoms of autism.

### Therapeutic strategies for autism: targeting three levels of the central dogma of molecular biology [^fe6cd704]. Translational Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

The past decade has yielded much success in the identification of risk genes for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), with many studies implicating loss-of-function (LoF) mutations within these genes. Despite this, no significant clinical advances have been made so far in the development of therapeutics for ASD. Given the role of LoF mutations in ASD etiology, many of the therapeutics in development are designed to rescue the haploinsufficient effect of genes at the transcriptional, translational, and protein levels. This review will discuss the various therapeutic techniques being developed from each level of the central dogma with examples including: CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) and gene replacement at the DNA level, antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) at the mRNA level, and small-molecule drugs at the protein level, followed by a review of current delivery methods for these therapeutics. Since central nervous system (CNS) penetrance is of utmost importance for ASD therapeutics, it is especially necessary to evaluate delivery methods that have higher efficiency in crossing the blood-brain barrier (BBB).

### Treating the whole person with autism: the proceedings of the autism speaks national autism conference [^f683d324]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2014). Low credibility.

The identification of autism spectrum disorders has increased dramatically over the past decade, with the latest estimates indicating prevalence as high as 1 in 54 boys. There is greater awareness of medical conditions that co-occur with autism and expansion of treatment options. Closer scrutiny has led to refinement of the diagnostic criteria, and there have been advances in genetics examining potential causal factors. Transition to adulthood is an area of growing concern, and professionals and families require guidance on this issue. This article summarizes the proceedings of the Autism Speaks conference on Treating the Whole Person with Autism: Care across the Lifespan. The conference was organized with the intent of providing a forum for both families and professionals to learn about the most current research in the field. Dr. Sue Swedo provides important background information regarding the changes in the diagnostic criteria for autism spectrum disorders. She particularly deals with the concerns of individuals and families that their autism diagnosis may change. Recommendations for genetic testing and its interpretation are provided by Dr. David Miller. His discussion helps make sense of the utility of genetic testing for ASD, along with demonstration of the complexity of determining which genetic factors are doing what and through which pathways. Dr. Jeremy Veenstra-VanderWeele provides useful background information on how medicines are initially identified and for what purpose and goes on to describe the present and future treatments in pharmacology. Medical issues are addressed by Dr. Paul Carbone, especially the coordination of comprehensive services through the medical home model of care. Dr. Julie Lounds Taylor concludes with guidance on preparation for adulthood, a topic of great importance to families as their child matures and for the professionals who will help guide this transition.

### Translational neuroscience approaches to understanding autism [^fb868187]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

While autism spectrum disorder affects nearly 2% of children in the United States, little is known with certainty concerning the etiologies and brain systems involved. This is due, in part, to the substantial heterogeneity in the presentation of the core symptoms of autism as well as the great number of co-occurring conditions that are common in autistic individuals. Understanding the neurobiology of autism is further hampered by the limited availability of postmortem brain tissue to determine the cellular and molecular alterations that take place in the autistic brain. Animal models therefore provide great translational value in helping to define the neural systems that constitute the social brain and mediate repetitive behaviors or interests. If they are based on genetic or environmental factors that contribute to autism, organisms from flies to nonhuman primates may serve as models of the neural structure or function of the autistic brain. Ultimately, successful models can also be employed to test the safety and effectiveness of potential therapeutics. This is an overview of the major animal species that are currently used as models of autism, including an appraisal of the advantages and limitations of each.

### An update on psychopharmacological treatment of autism spectrum disorder [^53d00a99]. Neurotherapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The current evidence-based management of ASD in children relies primarily on behavioral interventions to address the core symptoms of the condition. The role of pharmacological treatments currently is primarily to address co-morbid conditions associated with ASD and increases with age. These medications including anti-psychotic agents and stimulant medications are important in the clinical management of patients with ASD. However, the emergence of targeted treatments for subgroups of ASD where the genes responsible for the ASD are known and the neurobiology and potential targeted treatments have been studied to reverse the neurobiological abnormalities at least in the animal models has led to several recent achievements in patients as described here. Of note is that there are commonalities among disorders causing ASD that suggest that a targeted treatment for one disorder will be beneficial for other disorders. For instance, GABA deficits are seen in many forms of ASD and medications that are agonists for the GABA system such as CBD are likely to be helpful for many subtypes of ASD as described above. Mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with many forms of ASD, so medications that will improve mitochondrial dysfunction are likely to be helpful for many subtypes of ASD. The promise of gene therapy is becoming a reality for many disorders such as Duchene Muscular Dystrophy, Spinal Muscular Atrophy, and even Angelman Syndrome because of CRISPR/Cas 9 technology so in the next few years, many additional forms of ASD will be treated with gene therapy. Until then, some of the treatments outlined here can be tried and more will become available in the near future.

### Disentangling the heterogeneity of autism spectrum disorder through genetic findings [^c5a44ac4]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2014). Medium credibility.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) represents a heterogeneous group of disorders, which presents a substantial challenge to diagnosis and treatment. Over the past decade, considerable progress has been made in the identification of genetic risk factors for ASD that define specific mechanisms and pathways underlying the associated behavioural deficits. In this Review, we discuss how some of the latest advances in the genetics of ASD have facilitated parsing of the phenotypic heterogeneity of this disorder. We argue that only through such advances will we begin to define endophenotypes that can benefit from targeted, hypothesis-driven treatments. We review the latest technologies used to identify and characterize the genetics underlying ASD and then consider three themes-single-gene disorders, the gender bias in ASD, and the genetics of neurological comorbidities-that highlight ways in which we can use genetics to define the many phenotypes within the autism spectrum. We also present current clinical guidelines for genetic testing in ASD and their implications for prognosis and treatment.

### Leveraging a translational research approach to drive diagnostic and treatment advances for autism [^125c1412]. Molecular Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a prevalent and poorly understood neurodevelopmental disorder. There are currently no laboratory-based diagnostic tests to detect ASD, nor are there any disease-modifying medications that effectively treat ASD's core behavioral symptoms. Scientific progress has been impeded, in part, by overreliance on model organisms that fundamentally lack the sophisticated social and cognitive abilities essential for modeling ASD. We therefore saw significant value in studying naturally low-social rhesus monkeys to model human social impairment, taking advantage of a large outdoor-housed colony for behavioral screening and biomarker identification. Careful development and validation of our animal model, combined with a strong commitment to evaluating the translational utility of our preclinical findings directly in patients with ASD, yielded a robust neurochemical marker (cerebrospinal fluid vasopressin concentration) of trans-primate social impairment and a first-in-class medication (intranasal vasopressin) shown in a small phase 2a pilot trial to improve social abilities in children with ASD. This translational research approach stands to advance our understanding of ASD in a manner not readily achievable with existing animal models, and can be adapted to investigate a variety of other human brain disorders which currently lack valid preclinical options, thereby streamlining translation and amplifying clinical impact more broadly.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) epidemiology — In the United States, prevalence was estimated as 11.3 in 1,000, and rates of Asperger's disorder were reported as 2.6 in 10,000 (one fifth as common as typical autism). Autism is approximately 4 times more common in males than in females, and females with autism tend to have more severe intellectual disability. Within the United States, there may be underdiagnosis in minority communities.
