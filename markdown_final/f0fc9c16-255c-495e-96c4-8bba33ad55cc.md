## Question

Initial dose for diltiazem iv for atrial fibrillation rate control

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the initial intravenous diltiazem dose for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and how to administer it safely and effectively. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the guideline-backed standard bolus dose and infusion strategy. Then, I should verify the evidence supporting weight-based dosing versus fixed-dose alternatives. Next, I will review key safety contraindications and monitoring requirements. After that, I should consider special populations and dose adjustments. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, clinically actionable recommendation with supporting references.

> Let me first confirm the guideline-endorsed standard dose. The ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS guideline specifies an initial IV diltiazem bolus of 0.25 mg/kg actual body weight administered over 2 minutes, with the option to repeat with 0.35 mg/kg after 15 minutes if rate control is inadequate, followed by a continuous infusion of 5–15 mg/h for up to 24 hours, which aligns with FDA labeling and contemporary practice summaries [^112o8Bdt] [^114sWzoD] [^116Xz9ex].

> Wait, let me verify the rationale for weight-based dosing rather than a fixed milligram amount. Multiple studies show dose-dependent efficacy, with weight-based 0.25 mg/kg achieving higher early rate control than lower, non–weight-based strategies, and fixed 10–20 mg approaches may undertreat heavier patients while overtreating lighter patients. The FDA label explicitly notes that 20 mg is a reasonable dose for the average patient, underscoring that true standardization is weight-based rather than fixed [^1174Gczn] [^115TMwM7] [^114sWzoD].

> I should confirm the timing and infusion details. The initial bolus is given over 2 minutes, reassessment occurs at 15 minutes, and if needed, the second 0.35 mg/kg bolus is administered over 2 minutes. If ongoing control is required, a continuous infusion is started at 5–15 mg/h, titrated to heart rate and blood pressure, and generally not continued beyond 24 hours before transitioning to oral therapy [^114sWzoD] [^115nCuxs].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about safety without checking contraindications and monitoring. I need to ensure we avoid diltiazem in patients with LVEF ≤ 40% or decompensated heart failure because of negative inotropy, and I should confirm we do not use it in second- or third-degree AV block, sick sinus syndrome without a pacemaker, severe hypotension, or AF with pre-excitation/WPW. Continuous ECG and frequent blood pressure monitoring are required during IV administration, with resuscitation equipment available [^112o8Bdt] [^117GJMKM] [^115nCuxs].

> Let me consider special populations and dose adjustments. In older adults, some protocols cap the initial bolus at 10 mg and the second dose at 20 mg to mitigate hypotension risk, though this is not universal and should be individualized. In low body weight patients, strict mg/kg dosing prevents excessive dosing. In renal impairment, no adjustment is generally required, but hepatic dysfunction warrants caution due to prolonged half-life and reduced clearance. In pregnancy, beta-blockers are preferred first-line, with diltiazem as a second-line option if needed [^117Mp7Cx] [^114sWzoD] [^114Y7a1R] [^114HPDzo].

> I should double-check the comparative context with metoprolol and the risk of hypotension. Meta-analyses and ED studies suggest diltiazem may achieve rate control faster than metoprolol but is associated with more hypotension; this supports careful hemodynamic monitoring and consideration of pretreatment strategies such as IV calcium in patients at higher hypotension risk, although data are mixed and evolving [^116yHwAj] [^1154hvrQ] [^116bHtap].

> But wait, what if the patient is already on a beta-blocker chronically. Let me reconsider agent selection in that scenario. Observational data suggest that in patients on chronic beta-blockers, IV diltiazem may achieve rate control more reliably than IV metoprolol, though this is hypothesis-generating and should be balanced against hypotension risk and patient-specific factors [^113qz7fv].

> Next, I should review the practical steps to ensure safe administration. I need to check that continuous ECG and frequent blood pressure monitoring are in place, calculate the exact 0.25 mg/kg dose using actual body weight, administer over 2 minutes, reassess at 15 minutes, and if heart rate remains above target and blood pressure is adequate, administer the 0.35 mg/kg dose. If ongoing control is needed, start a 5–15 mg/h infusion and transition to oral diltiazem ER 120–360 mg daily once stable, while watching for hypotension and bradycardia throughout [^115nCuxs] [^114sWzoD] [^111q7U5a].

> Final synthesis: The initial IV diltiazem dose for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response is 0.25 mg/kg actual body weight administered over 2 minutes, with a second bolus of 0.35 mg/kg after 15 minutes if needed, followed by a continuous infusion of 5–15 mg/h for up to 24 hours. This weight-based approach is guideline-endorsed, supported by dose–response data, and balances efficacy with safety when combined with appropriate monitoring and contraindication screening [^112o8Bdt] [^114sWzoD] [^1174Gczn].

---

The initial IV diltiazem dose for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response is **0.25 mg/kg IV bolus over 2 minutes** [^112o8Bdt] [^114sWzoD]. If the heart rate remains uncontrolled after 15 minutes, administer a second bolus of **0.35 mg/kg IV over 2 minutes** [^116Xz9ex]. For elderly or frail patients, consider a lower initial dose (e.g. 10–15 mg) to reduce hypotension risk [^117Mp7Cx]. After rate control is achieved, start a continuous infusion at 5–15 mg/h [^115nCuxs] and monitor for hypotension and bradycardia [^112GLsyE].

---

## Recommended initial IV diltiazem dose

- **Initial dose**: 0.25 mg/kg IV bolus over 2 minutes [^112o8Bdt] [^114sWzoD].
- **Second dose**: If the heart rate remains uncontrolled after 15 minutes, administer 0.35 mg/kg IV bolus over 2 minutes [^116Xz9ex].
- **Maximum initial dose**: 20 mg (for average adult ~80 kg) [^notfound].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting the recommended dose

- **FDA labeling**: 0.25 mg/kg IV bolus over 2 minutes; repeat with 0.35 mg/kg after 15 minutes if needed [^114sWzoD].
- **ACC/AHA guidelines**: 0.25 mg/kg IV over 2 minutes; may repeat 0.35 mg/kg; then 5–15 mg/h infusion [^112o8Bdt].
- **Clinical trials**: Weight-based dosing achieves higher rate control at 30 minutes than lower fixed doses [^1174Gczn].

---

## Alternative dosing strategies

Alternative dosing includes a **lower initial dose** of 0.15 mg/kg IV bolus for elderly or frail patients to reduce hypotension risk, though duration of action may be shorter [^114sWzoD]. A **fixed-dose approach** of 10–20 mg IV bolus is sometimes used, but weight-based dosing is preferred for accuracy and efficacy [^115Q85ip] [^1174Gczn].

---

## Clinical outcomes associated with the recommended dose

- **Rate control**: Achieves HR < 100 bpm in ~55% at 30 minutes [^1174Gczn].
- **Time to effect**: Onset within 2–7 minutes; peak effect by 15 minutes [^114Y4yqy].
- **Duration**: Effect lasts 1–3 hours after bolus [^113B1CAL].

---

## Safety considerations and monitoring

- **Hypotension**: Monitor closely; occurs in ~3–18% of patients [^113B1CAL] [^1119RNHb].
- **Bradycardia**: Monitor for HR < 60 bpm [^1154hvrQ].
- **Contraindications**: Avoid in severe hypotension, cardiogenic shock, or accessory bypass tract (e.g. WPW) [^117GJMKM].

---

## Special populations and dose adjustments

In special populations, **elderly/frail patients** should start with a lower dose (e.g. 10–15 mg) to reduce hypotension risk [^117Mp7Cx]. Patients with **renal impairment** require no adjustment, but renal function should be monitored [^112qFaRP]. Patients with **hepatic impairment** should receive cautious dosing due to prolonged half-life and reduced clearance [^111bBdbB].

---

## Initial IV diltiazem dosing

| **Patient population** | **Initial dose** | **Second dose** | **Infusion** |
|-|-|-|-|
| General adult population | 0.25 mg/kg IV bolus over 2 min | 0.35 mg/kg IV bolus after 15 min if needed | 5–15 mg/h continuous infusion |
| Elderly/frail patients | 10–15 mg IV bolus (lower dose) | Adjust based on response | 5–10 mg/h continuous infusion |
| Renal impairment | No adjustment | No adjustment | Monitor renal function |
| Hepatic impairment | Use caution | Use caution | Use caution |

---

The initial IV diltiazem dose for AF with RVR is **0.25 mg/kg IV bolus over 2 minutes**, with a second 0.35 mg/kg bolus after 15 minutes if needed. Adjust dosing for elderly or frail patients, monitor for hypotension and bradycardia, and follow with a 5–15 mg/h infusion for sustained control.

### Calcium chloride before I.V. diltiazem in the management of atrial fibrillation [^111fxGgX]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Diltiazem is commonly used to treat atrial fibrillation or flutter (AFF) with rapid ventricular response (RVR). Although it is very effective for rate control, up to an 18% prevalence of reported diltiazem-induced hypotension [defined by systolic blood pressure (SBP) < 90 mm Hg], and a mean of 9.7% hypotension have been reported from several studies totaling over 450 patients. This hypotension may complicate therapy. Our objective was to determine if calcium chloride (CaCl(2)) pre-treatment would blunt a SBP drop after i.v. diltiazem, while allowing diltiazem to maintain its efficacy. A prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted. Seventy-eight patients with AFF and a ventricular rate of ≥ 120 beats per minute were enrolled. Half received i.v. CaCl(2) pre-treatment; the other half received placebo. All patients then received i.v. diltiazem in a standard, weight-based dose. A second dose of CaCl(2) pre-treatment or placebo and diltiazem was given if clinically indicated for additional rate control. Both CaCl(2) and placebo pre-treatment groups had equal lowering of heart rate (p < 0.001). There were no adverse events in the calcium pre-treatment study arm. One patient in the placebo group became paradoxically more tachycardic and apneic after the diltiazem infusion. Although i.v. CaCl(2) seems to be equally safe compared to placebo as a pre-treatment in the management of AFF with RVR, we were unable to find a statistically significant blunting of SBP drop with CaCl(2) i.v. pre-treatment. Until further research determines a benefit exists, we cannot recommend i.v. CaCl(2) pre-treatment before diltiazem in the treatment of AFF with RVR.

### The use of diltiazem for treating rapid atrial fibrillation in the out-of-hospital setting [^111VTWx5]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Study Objective

We sought to evaluate the use of intravenous diltiazem for treatment of rapid atrial fibrillation or flutter (RAF) in the out-of-hospital setting.

Methods

This study is a retrospective review of data with historical control subjects. Data were drawn from out-of-hospital patients reported to a statewide paramedic system who presented with atrial fibrillation or flutter and a ventricular response rate (VRR) of 150 beats/min or greater. The intervention (diltiazem) group included patients who received diltiazem during a 9-month period in 1999. The control group included patients from 1998 who did not receive diltiazem. Patients who were intubated or underwent cardioversion were omitted. Therapeutic response was defined as the occurrence of change to sinus rhythm, reduction of VRR to 100 beats/min or less, or reduction of baseline VRR by 20% or greater. Data were analyzed by using the chi(2) test, the Student's t test, and odds ratios (ORs). A Bonferroni adjusted P value of.005 was used to define statistical significance.

Results

Forty-three patients receiving diltiazem and 27 control subjects were included in the study. The mean total diltiazem dose was 19.8 mg (95% confidence interval 17.8 to 21.8). The diltiazem and control groups did not significantly differ with respect to age; sex; history of atrial fibrillation; prior use of digitalis, beta-blockers, or calcium channel blockers; concurrent out-of-hospital therapies; or baseline VRR or systolic blood pressure (P = .09 to 1.00). The difference in VRR reduction between the diltiazem and control groups was 38 beats/min (95% confidence interval 24 to 52); this difference was statistically significant (P < .001). The mean percentage reduction of VRR in the diltiazem group was -33.1%. The difference in systolic blood pressure change between the diltiazem and control groups was not statistically significant (P = .17). The diltiazem group had a higher prevalence of achieving VRR reduction to 100 beats/min or less than did the control group (OR 22.6; P < .001), of achieving a VRR reduction of 20% or greater (OR 19.3; P < .001), and of achieving overall therapeutic response (OR 19.3; P < .001). Few changed to sinus rhythm in either group (estimated OR 6.3; p = 0.15). No patients in the diltiazem group required treatment for hypotension, endotracheal intubation, resuscitation from cardiac arrest, or emergency treatment of unstable dysrhythmias.

Conclusion

The effects of diltiazem on RAF can be appreciated within the constraints of the out-of-hospital environment. Diltiazem should be considered as a viable field therapy for rate control of RAF.

Heart Rhythm (2016). Medium credibility.

Atrial flutter — acute treatment (2015 ACC/AHA/HRS SVT guideline) lists Class I recommendations: I A — oral dofetilide or intravenous ibutilide is useful for acute pharmacological cardioversion in patients with atrial flutter, with intravenous ibutilide converting atrial flutter to sinus rhythm in approximately 60% of cases; the major risk is torsades de pointes, patients receiving ibutilide should undergo continuous ECG monitoring during administration and for at least 4 hours after completion of dosing, and pretreatment with magnesium can increase the efficacy and reduce the risk of torsades de pointes. I B-R — intravenous or oral beta blockers, diltiazem, or verapamil are useful for acute rate control in patients with atrial flutter who are hemodynamically stable. I B-NR — elective synchronized cardioversion is indicated to stabilize patients with well-tolerated atrial flutter when a rhythm-control strategy is being pursued, and I B-NR — synchronized cardioversion is recommended for acute treatment of patients with atrial flutter who are hemodynamically unstable and do not respond to pharmacological therapies. I C-LD — rapid atrial pacing is useful for acute conversion of atrial flutter in patients who have pacing wires in place as part of a permanent pacemaker or implantable cardioverter–defibrillator or for temporary atrial pacing after cardiac surgery; atrial pacing is effective at terminating flutter in > 50% of cases, and pace-termination is performed by pacing approximately 5% to 10% above the atrial flutter rate and by maintaining pacing for ≥ 15 seconds with repeated attempts at incrementally faster rates (reducing the pacing cycle length by 5 to 10 ms) until normal sinus rhythm or AF occurs.

### Low-dose diltiazem in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response [^1119RNHb]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

Diltiazem is one of the most commonly used medications to control the rapid ventricular response in atrial fibrillation (AF). The recommended starting dose is an intravenous bolus of 0.25 mg/kg over 2 minutes. To avoid hypotension, we have empirically used a lower dose of diltiazem. We compared the efficacy and safety of different doses of diltiazem in rapid AF.

Methods

A retrospective chart review was undertaken in patients who presented to the emergency department with rapid AF. Patients were divided into 3 groups according to diltiazem dosage: low dose (≤ 0.2 mg/kg), standard dose (> 0.2 and ≤ 0.3 mg/kg), and high dose (> 0.3 mg/kg). We compared the rates of therapeutic response (adequate rate control) and complications (such as hypotension). Multivariate regression analysis was used to determine the effect of diltiazem dose on the occurrence of complications.

Results

A total of 180 patients were included in the analysis. There were no significant differences in the rates of therapeutic response for the low-, standard-, and high-dose groups (70.5%, 77.1%, and 77.8%; p = 0.605). The rates of hypotension in the low-, standard-, and high-dose groups were 18%, 34.9%, and 41.7%, respectively. After adjusting confounding variables, the rate of hypotension was significantly lower in the low-dose group in comparison with the standard-dose group (adjusted odds ratio, 0.39; 95% confidence interval, 0.16–0.94).

Conclusions

Low-dose diltiazem might be as effective as the standard dose in controlling rapid AF and reduce the risk of hypotension.

DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION

Direct Intravenous Single Injections (Bolus)

The initial dose of diltiazem hydrochloride injection should be 0.25 mg/kg actual body weight as a bolus administered over 2 minutes (20 mg is a reasonable dose for the average patient). If response is inadequate, a second dose may be administered after 15 minutes. The second bolus dose of diltiazem hydrochloride injection should be 0.35 mg/kg actual body weight administered over 2 minutes (25 mg is a reasonable dose for the average patient). Subsequent intravenous bolus doses should be individualized for each patient. Patients with low body weights should be dosed on a mg/kg basis. Some patients may respond to an initial dose of 0.15 mg/kg, although duration of action may be shorter. Experience with this dose is limited.

Continuous Intravenous Infusion

For continued reduction of the heart rate (up to 24 hours) in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, an intravenous infusion of diltiazem hydrochloride injection or diltiazem hydrochloride for injection may be administered. (For reconstitution of diltiazem hydrochloride for injection, see instructions contained within packaging.) Immediately following bolus administration of 20 mg (0.25 mg/kg) or 25 mg (0.35 mg/kg) diltiazem hydrochloride injection and reduction of heart rate, begin an intravenous infusion of diltiazem hydrochloride injection or diltiazem hydrochloride for injection. The recommended initial infusion rate of diltiazem hydrochloride injection or diltiazem hydrochloride for injection is 10 mg/h. Some patients may maintain response to an initial rate of 5 mg/h. The infusion rate may be increased in 5 mg/h increments up to 15 mg/h as needed, if further reduction in heart rate is required. The infusion may be maintained for up to 24 hours.

### Diltiazem hydrochloride (DILTIAZEM HYDROCHLORIDE in SODIUM CHLORIDE) [^114Y7a1R]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The systemic clearance of diltiazem has been found to be decreased in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, compared to healthy volunteers. In patients administered continuous infusions at 10 mg/h or 15 mg/h for 24 h, diltiazem systemic clearance averaged 42 L/h and 31 L/h, respectively. The plasma elimination half-life is approximately 3.4 h. Total radioactivity measurement following short IV administration in healthy volunteers suggests the presence of other unidentified metabolites which attain higher concentrations than those of diltiazem and are more slowly eliminated; half-life of total radioactivity is about 20 h compared to 2 to 5 h for diltiazem.

After constant rate intravenous infusion to healthy male volunteers, diltiazem exhibits nonlinear pharmacokinetics over an infusion range of 4.8 to 13.2 mg/h for 24 h. Over this infusion range, as the dose is increased, systemic clearance decreases from 64 to 48 L/h while the plasma elimination half-life increases from 4.1 to 4.9 h. The volume of distribution remains unchanged (360 to 391 L).

Specific Populations

Renal insufficiency, or even end-stage renal disease, does not appear to influence diltiazem disposition following oral administration. Liver cirrhosis reduces diltiazem's apparent clearance and prolong its half-life.

### 2023 ACC / AHA / ACCP / HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^112wWpUS]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Management of patients with heart failure (HF) and atrial fibrillation (AF) includes guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) for HF, thromboembolism prophylaxis, and risk factor modification, with cardioversion if indicated via electrical cardioversion (1) or pharmacological cardioversion (2a). For rate control with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 40%, NDCC (Diltiazem, Verapamil) is classified as (3: Harm), while beta blockers (1), digoxin (2a), and IV amiodarone* for acute rate control (2a) are listed; with LVEF > 40%, beta blockers or NDCC (1), digoxin (2a), and IV amiodarone* for acute rate control (2a) are listed. The figure also directs to evaluate if appropriate for rhythm control with catheter ablation.

### Diltiazem vs. metoprolol in the management of atrial fibrillation or flutter with rapid ventricular rate in the emergency department [^116yHwAj]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Diltiazem (calcium channel blocker) and metoprolol (beta-blocker) are both commonly used to treat atrial fibrillation/flutter (AFF) in the emergency department (ED). However, there is considerable regional variability in emergency physician practice patterns and debate among physicians as to which agent is more effective. To date, only one small prospective, randomized trial has compared the effectiveness of diltiazem and metoprolol for rate control of AFF in the ED and concluded no difference in effectiveness between the two agents.

Objective

Our aim was to compare the effectiveness of diltiazem with metoprolol for rate control of AFF in the ED.

Methods

A convenience sample of adult patients presenting with rapid atrial fibrillation or flutter was randomly assigned to receive either diltiazem or metoprolol. The study team monitored each subject's systolic and diastolic blood pressures and heart rates for 30 min.

Results

In the first 5 min, 50.0% of the diltiazem group and 10.7% of the metoprolol group reached the target heart rate (HR) of < 100 beats per minute (bpm) (p < 0.005). By 30 min, 95.8% of the diltiazem group and 46.4% of the metoprolol group reached the target HR < 100 bpm (p < 0.0001). Mean decrease in HR for the diltiazem group was more rapid and substantial than that of the metoprolol group. From a safety perspective, there was no difference between the groups with respect to hypotension (systolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg) and bradycardia (HR < 60 bpm).

Conclusions

Diltiazem was more effective in achieving rate control in ED patients with AFF and did so with no increased incidence of adverse effects.

Regarding medical management for atrial fibrillation, more specifically with respect to rate control, long-term control, beta-blockers and CCBs, ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend to initiate beta blockers or nondihydropyridine CCBs (diltiazem, verapamil) for long-term rate control, with the choice of agent based on the underlying substrate and comorbid conditions, in patients with AF.

Regarding medical management for atrial fibrillation, more specifically with respect to management of hypertension (anticoagulation), ESH 2023 guidelines recommend to be cautious when using nondihydropyridine CCBs (diltiazem or verapamil) for rate control, as they may interfere with OACs and increase bleeding risk.

Amiodarone versus calcium channel blockers

One RCT, one prospective and three retrospective comparative studies compared amiodarone and calcium channel blockers (Table 2, Additional file 1: Tables S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, and S6), all were relatively small with between eight and 61 patients included.

Table 2

b Statistically not significant

c Includes beta blockers group

d Includes beta blockers group no treatment groups

A small RCT of 60 patients compared diltiazem, amiodarone bolus and amiodarone bolus followed by an amiodarone infusion in a mixed ICU population. No evidence of a difference was identified between treatment groups in the primary study endpoint of rate reduction ≥ 30% at 4 h. Hypotension resulting in drug discontinuation was more common with diltiazem use (30%) vs amiodarone (0–5%). This study was judged to have a high risk of bias. A non-randomised study comparing diltiazem and amiodarone in a noncardiac surgical ICU population found no evidence of differences between the study groups in the proportion cardioverted at 24 h or in time to cardioversion. No evidence of a difference in rates of hypotension was identified. Similar length of ICU and hospital stays was also reported. This study was small and most likely underpowered to detect any treatment differences. A conference abstract found no statistically significant difference in mortality at discharge. Two studies compared rate and rhythm control between treatment groups but results were subject to much uncertainty due to the limited data reported and small sample size. Figure 2 shows rhythm control risk ratio results for studies comparing amiodarone with calcium channel blockers.

### Atrial fibrillation care improvement collaborative [^116LRRX3]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Strategy

The project team began meeting in February 2013. A standardized atrial fibrillation order set was developed for the emergency department, addressing the preferred rate control medication (diltiazem) and an alternative anticoagulant (dabigatran). The calcium channel blocker diltiazem was chosen rather than a beta blocker (such as esmolol) for several reasons including literature support for its use, the ability to use in patients with bronchospastic airway disease, the ability to administer as an IV drip via nomogram, provider familiarity, and ability to easily convert to oral therapy.

Dabigatran, rather than the more complex low molecular weight heparin and warfarin regimen, was offered as an option to patients when appropriate. Dabigatran was the only novel oral anticoagulant (NOAC) available for atrial fibrillation stroke prophylaxis when project planning began, and the project group elected to stay with a single agent through implementation despite availability of other NOACs subsequently. A 30 day supply of dabigatran was provided to patients who chose this option.

The emergency department atrial fibrillation order set also encompassed stroke risk calculation using the CHADS2 score, the role and timing of cardioversion, and utilization of the emergency department observation unit.

Stable local AF patients followed up with their primary care providers, rather than cardiologists, whenever possible. Cardiology and emergency department project champions communicated the order set and practice changes to their providers. Primary care project champions educated family medicine and primary care internal medicine staff via email and intranet, face to face presentations, and educational videos. Project leadership participated in an institution wide panel presentation and question and answer session. Initial rollout took place in July 2013.

The project group continued to meet after rollout to troubleshoot several issues, including the process of developing an AF order set for a busy emergency department. This task was completed within the project timeline. Additionally, providing a 30 day supply of dabigatran to patients proved challenging, but a medication discount applied within the pharmacy system improved access to this medication. Finally, the problematic connections between the emergency department control desk and the primary care practice scheduling desks were improved by providing the ED with phone numbers, electronic message access and clinic hours while at the same time educating primary care schedulers regarding prioritization of follow up for AF patients.

INDICATIONS & USAGE

Diltiazem Hydrochloride Injection or Diltiazem Hydrochloride for Injection are indicated for the following:

Atrial Fibrillation or Atrial Flutter

Temporary control of rapid ventricular rate in atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. It should not be used in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter associated with an accessory bypass tract such as in Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome or short PR syndrome.

In addition, Diltiazem Hydrochloride Injection is indicated for:

Paroxysmal Supraventricular Tachycardia

Rapid conversion of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardias (PSVT) to sinus rhythm. This includes AV nodal reentrant tachycardias and reciprocating tachycardias associated with an extranodal accessory pathway such as the WPW syndrome or short PR syndrome. Unless otherwise contraindicated, appropriate vagal maneuvers should be attempted prior to administration of diltiazem hydrochloride injection.

The use of diltiazem hydrochloride injection or diltiazem hydrochloride for injection should be undertaken with caution when the patient is compromised hemodynamically or is taking other drugs that decrease any or all of the following: peripheral resistance, myocardial filling, myocardial contractility, or electrical impulse propagation in the myocardium.

For either indication and particularly when employing continuous intravenous infusion, the setting should include continuous monitoring of the ECG and frequent measurement of blood pressure. A defibrillator and emergency equipment should be readily available.

### Comparison of the effectiveness of intravenous diltiazem and metoprolol in the management of rapid ventricular rate in atrial fibrillation [^112uRzKr]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the effectiveness of intravenous (IV) diltiazem and metoprolol in the management of rapid ventricular rate in atrial fibrillation (AF).

Methods

This prospective, randomised study was conducted in the Emergency Department of the Uludag University Medical Faculty Hospital, Bursa, Turkey. Forty AF patients with a ventricular rate ≥ 120/minute and systolic blood pressure ≥ 95 mm Hg were included and randomised to receive IV diltiazem 0.25 mg/kg (maximum 25 mg) or metoprolol 0.15 mg/kg (maximum 10 mg) over 2 minutes. Blood pressures and heart rate were measured at 2, 5, 10, 15, and 20 minutes. Successful treatment was defined as fall in ventricular rate to below 100/minute or decrease in ventricular rate by 20% or return to sinus rhythm.

Results

Between January 2000 and July 2002, 40 patients (18 men, 22 women) met the inclusion criteria. Of these 20 (8 men, 12 women; mean age 60.2 years, range 31–82) received diltiazem and 20 (10 men, 10 women; mean age 64.0 years, range 31–82) received metoprolol. The success rate at 20 minutes for diltiazem and metoprolol was 90% (n = 18) and 80% (n = 16), respectively. The success rate at 2 minutes was higher in the diltiazem group. The percentage decrease in ventricular rate was higher in the diltiazem group at each time interval. None of the patients had hypotension.

Conclusion

Both diltiazem and metoprolol were safe and effective for the management of rapid ventricular rate in AF. However, the rate control effect began earlier and the percentage decrease in ventricular rate was higher with diltiazem than with metoprolol.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

ACC/AHA/ESC 2006 atrial fibrillation — pharmacological rate control (Class I): Measurement of the heart rate at rest and control of the rate with pharmacological agents are recommended for persistent or permanent atrial fibrillation (AF) (Level of Evidence: B). In the absence of preexcitation, intravenous beta blockers (esmolol, metoprolol, or propranolol) or nondihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists (verapamil, diltiazem) are recommended to slow the ventricular response to AF in the acute setting, with caution in hypotension or heart failure (HF) (Level of Evidence: B). Intravenous digoxin or amiodarone is recommended to control heart rate in patients with AF and HF without an accessory pathway (Level of Evidence: B). For patients with activity-related AF symptoms, adequacy of rate control should be assessed during exercise and pharmacological treatment adjusted to keep the rate in the physiologic range (Level of Evidence: C). Oral digoxin is effective to control resting heart rate in AF and is indicated for HF, left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, or sedentary individuals (Level of Evidence: C).

### Intravenous metoprolol versus diltiazem for rate control in noncardiac, nonthoracic postoperative atrial fibrillation [^112QN4a7]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Little guidance exists on effective management of postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) following noncardiac, nonthoracic (NCNT) surgery.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to identify whether a difference exists between intravenous (IV) metoprolol and diltiazem when used to achieve hemodynamically stable rate control in POAF following NCNT surgery.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study examined critically ill adult surgical patients experiencing POAF with rapid ventricular response. Inclusion in the metoprolol or diltiazem treatment group was determined by the initial rate control agent chosen by the prescriber. The primary end point was hemodynamically stable rate control, defined by heart rate (HR) < 110 beats/min and blood pressure > 90 mm Hg, maintained for 6 hours.

Main Results

Patients on metoprolol (n = 66) and diltiazem (n = 55) were similar in age, comorbidities, surgical procedure distribution, acuity of illness, and home rate and rhythm control medications continued during hospitalization; 76% of diltiazem-treated patients achieved hemodynamically stable rate control, compared with only 53% of those receiving metoprolol (P = .005). Safety end points were similar between groups, including the portion requiring a new vasopressor or fluid bolus for hemodynamic support.

Conclusions

In NCNT surgery, patients with POAF, IV diltiazem more effectively controlled HR and hemodynamics compared with metoprolol. Results warrant further research into optimal medical management of POAF in this population using these 2 agents.

### Impact of an emergency department observation unit management algorithm for atrial fibrillation [^115Q85ip]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Initially, patients were assessed for stability, which was primarily determined by the discretion of the provider, with instability being suggested by chest pain, ST‐segment changes concerning for ischemia, respiratory distress, hypoxia, or hypotension. Patients deemed unstable were excluded from the treatment algorithm and were instead resuscitated as indicated by the clinical scenario.

After the initial evaluation and assessment of stability, intravenous (IV) diltiazem was recommended as the initial medication for rate control at an initial dose of 0.1 to 0.25 mg/kg or 10 to 20 mg IV over 2 minutes. This dose could be repeated 15 minutes later if the heart rate remained > 110 beats per minute (bpm) and blood pressure remained adequate. Simultaneously, 30 mg of oral diltiazem was recommended to be administered after the initial bolus was given, which would be scheduled to be given every 6 hours while the patient remained in the ED. If the patient's heart rate continued to be > 110 bpm after 2 doses of intravenous diltiazem and 30 mg of oral diltiazem, providers were instructed to consider initiation of a continuous diltiazem infusion at 5 mg/h titrated to a heart rate of 80 to 110 bpm, increased in increments of 3 to 5 mg/h every 5 minutes, as blood pressure allowed.

### Intravenous diltiazem is superior to intravenous amiodarone or digoxin for achieving ventricular rate control in patients with acute uncomplicated atrial fibrillation [^116bKBFd]. Critical Care Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

To compare the clinical efficacy of intravenous diltiazem, digoxin, and amiodarone for acute ventricular rate (VR) control in patients with acute symptomatic atrial fibrillation (AF) necessitating hospitalization.

Design

Randomized control trial.

Setting

Acute emergency medical admission unit in a regional teaching hospital in Hong Kong.

Patients

One hundred fifty adult patients with acute AF and rapid VR (> 120 bpm).

Interventions

Patients were randomly assigned in 1:1:1 ratio to receive intravenous diltiazem, digoxin, or amiodarone for VR control.

Measurements and Main Results

The primary end point was sustained VR control (< 90 bpm) within 24 hours; the secondary end points included AF symptom improvement and length of hospitalization. At 24 hours, VR control was achieved in 119 of 150 patients (79%). The time to VR control was significantly shorter among patients in the diltiazem group (log-rank test, p < 0.0001) with the percentage of patients who achieved VR control being higher in the diltiazem group (90%) than the digoxin group (74%) and the amiodarone group (74%). The median time to VR control was significantly shorter in the diltiazem group (3 hours, 1–21 hours) compared with the digoxin (6 hours, 3–15 hours, p < 0.001) and amiodarone groups (7 hours, 1–18 hours, p = 0.003). Furthermore, patients in the diltiazem group persistently had the lowest mean VR after the first hour of drug administration compared with the other two groups (p < 0.05). The diltiazem group had the largest reduction in AF symptom frequency score and severity score (p < 0.0001). In addition, length of hospital stay was significantly shorter in the diltiazem group (3.9 ± 1.6 days) compared with digoxin (4.7 ± 2.1 days, p = 0.023) and amiodarone groups (4.7 ± 2.2 days, p = 0.038).

Conclusions

As compared with digoxin and amiodarone, intravenous diltiazem was safe and effective in achieving VR control to improve symptoms and to reduce hospital stay in patients with acute AF.

Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter in pregnancy — rate control: In hemodynamically stable pregnant patients with AF or AFL with rapid ventricular rates (RVR), intravenous beta-blockers are recommended as the first-line option and diltiazem or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, alone or in combination, are recommended as second-line options for initial rate control in the absence of preexcitation (Class 1, C-LD). In pregnant patients with AF or AFL with RVR, beta-blockers, digoxin, or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers alone or in combination, are reasonable for rate control with the choice of drug dependent on the underlying maternal cardiac substrate (Class 2a, C-LD).

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Acute pharmacological cardioversion of atrial fibrillation (AF) — agent-specific notes: Intravenous esmolol may have modest efficacy for pharmacological cardioversion of recent-onset AF, but this has not been established by comparison with placebo; it is not useful in patients with persistent AF, a response may be expected within 1 h after initiation of intravenous infusion, and hypotension and bronchospasm are major adverse effects. Verapamil and diltiazem have not been found effective for pharmacological cardioversion of recent-onset or persistent AF but act rapidly to control the rate of ventricular response; negative inotropic effects might result in hypotension and caution should be used in patients with heart failure (HF). Digitalis glycosides are generally not more effective than placebo for conversion of recent-onset AF to sinus rhythm, may prolong episodes of paroxysmal AF, and manifestations of digitalis toxicity are dose related. Disopyramide has not been tested adequately for conversion of AF but may be effective when administered intravenously; adverse effects include drying of mucous membranes, constipation, urinary retention, and depression of left ventricular (LV) contractility, making it a relatively unattractive option. Sotalol has no proved efficacy for pharmacological cardioversion of recent-onset or persistent AF when given either orally or intravenously, but it does control the heart rate; in patients who tolerate AF relatively well, a wait-and-see approach using oral sotalol is an appropriate option, and side effects consist mainly of QT prolongation associated with torsades de pointes.

### Management of newly detected atrial fibrillation: a clinical practice guideline from the American Academy of Family Physicians and the American College of Physicians [^116XDtfT]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

The Joint Panel of the American Academy of Family Physicians and the American College of Physicians, in collaboration with the Johns Hopkins Evidence-based Practice Center, systematically reviewed the available evidence on the management of newly detected atrial fibrillation and developed recommendations for adult patients with first-detected atrial fibrillation. The recommendations do not apply to patients with postoperative or post-myocardial infarction atrial fibrillation, patients with class IV heart failure, patients already taking antiarrhythmic drugs, or patients with valvular disease. The target physician audience is internists and family physicians dedicated to primary care. The recommendations are as follows: RECOMMENDATION 1: Rate control with chronic anticoagulation is the recommended strategy for the majority of patients with atrial fibrillation. Rhythm control has not been shown to be superior to rate control (with chronic anticoagulation) in reducing morbidity and mortality and may be inferior in some patient subgroups to rate control. Rhythm control is appropriate when based on other special considerations, such as patient symptoms, exercise tolerance, and patient preference. Grade: 2A. RECOMMENDATION 2: Patients with atrial fibrillation should receive chronic anticoagulation with adjusted-dose warfarin, unless they are at low risk of stroke or have a specific contraindication to the use of warfarin (thrombocytopenia, recent trauma or surgery, alcoholism). Grade: 1A. RECOMMENDATION 3: For patients with atrial fibrillation, the following drugs are recommended for their demonstrated efficacy in rate control during exercise and while at rest: atenolol, metoprolol, diltiazem, and verapamil (drugs listed alphabetically by class). Digoxin is only effective for rate control at rest and therefore should only be used as a second-line agent for rate control in atrial fibrillation. Grade: 1B. RECOMMENDATION 4: For those patients who elect to undergo acute cardioversion to achieve sinus rhythm in atrial fibrillation, both direct-current cardioversion (Grade: 1C+) and pharmacological conversion (Grade: 2A) are appropriate options. RECOMMENDATION 5: Both transesophageal echocardiography with short-term prior anticoagulation followed by early acute cardioversion (in the absence of intracardiac thrombus) with postcardioversion anticoagulation versus delayed cardioversion with pre- and postanticoagulation are appropriate management strategies for those patients who elect to undergo cardioversion. Grade: 2A. RECOMMENDATION 6: Most patients converted to sinus rhythm from atrial fibrillation should not be placed on rhythm maintenance therapy since the risks outweigh the benefits. In a selected group of patients whose quality of life is compromised by atrial fibrillation, the recommended pharmacologic agents for rhythm maintenance are amiodarone, disopyramide, propafenone, and sotalol (drugs listed in alphabetical order). The choice of agent predominantly depends on specific risk of side effects based on patient characteristics. Grade: 2A.

### Acute ventricular rate control in atrial fibrillation: IV combination of diltiazem and digoxin vs. IV diltiazem alone [^115HLdau]. Chest (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To analyze the efficacy of an IV combination of diltiazem and digoxin vs IV diltiazem alone for acute ventricular rate control in patients with atrial fibrillation.

Design

Prospective, randomized, open-label study.

Patients and Methods

Fifty-two patients with atrial fibrillation and uncontrolled ventricular rates were randomized to receive either an IV combination of diltiazem and digoxin or IV diltiazem alone and were observed for 12 h. The successful rate control was defined as a ventricular rate < 100 beats per minute (bpm) persisting for 1 h or conversion to sinus rhythm. The loss of rate control was defined as an increase in the ventricular rate to > 100 bpm persistently for > 30 min or rebound to atrial fibrillation.

Results

In both treatment arms (n = 26 each), all patients achieved successful and comparable ventricular rate control at 12 h. The mean (± SD) time taken to achieve successful rate control was shorter in the combination arm (15 ± 16 vs. 22 ± 22 min). Six patients in the combination arm and 11 in the diltiazem-alone arm experienced episodes of loss of rate control. This loss in the combination arm was less than that in the diltiazem-alone arm (14 vs 39 episodes; p = 0.05). The loss of rate control per patient in the combination arm was also less than that in the diltiazem-alone arm (2.0 ± 1.0 vs. 3.5 ± 1.9 episodes per patient; p = 0.04).

Conclusions

This study demonstrates that in patients with atrial fibrillation who have a rapid ventricular response, the IV combination of diltiazem and digoxin results in a more efficacious ventricular rate control with fewer fluctuations than that achieved by therapy with IV diltiazem alone.

### How to manage atrial fibrillation secondary to ibrutinib [^113G2zRv]. JACC: CardioOncology (2021). Medium credibility.

How Do We Decide on Rate Control Versus Rhythm Control?

There is a paucity of randomized controlled trial data addressing the question of rate versus rhythm control in patients with hematologic malignancy. We typically advise a rate control strategy, because maintenance of sinus rhythm may be less likely in patients being treated with proarrhythmogenic cancer therapies. In specific populations, rhythm control may be more appropriate; for example, in young patients without structural heart disease who have completed proarrhythmogenic therapy or patients who are unable to tolerate their symptom load. When using a rate control strategy, we advise beta-blockers as first-line therapy. This is due to interactions between ibrutinib and calcium channel blockers (diltiazem and verapamil), which have a CYP3A4 inhibitory effect resulting in increased levels of ibrutinib and resultant exacerbation of AF and bleeding. Digoxin is also known to have P-glycoprotein interactions resulting in increased plasma levels of digoxin and so should be avoided whenever possible. If there are no other options, we suggest a lower dose of digoxin to be given 6 h before or after ibrutinib.

In our case, a decision was made for a rate control strategy based on: 1) patient's age; 2) need for ongoing Ibrutinib treatment; 3) low symptom burden reported by the patient; and 4) left atrial enlargement on echocardiogram suggesting that a rhythm control strategy was less likely to be successful.

### Weight-based versus non-weight-based diltiazem dosing in the setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response [^115TMwM7]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

There is conflicting evidence to support the superiority of weight-based (WB) dosing of intravenous (IV) diltiazem over non-weight-based (NWB) dosing strategies in the management of atrial fibrillation (AFib) with rapid ventricular response (RVR).

Methods

A retrospective review evaluated patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) in AFib with RVR and receiving IV diltiazem from 2015 to 2018. Those receiving a NWB dose were compared with those receiving a WB dose based on actual body weight (ABW). Secondary analyses evaluated safety profiles of the regimens and compared response in groups defined by ABW or ideal body weight (IBW).

Results

A total of 371 patients were included in the analysis. No significant difference was observed in achieving a therapeutic response (66.5% vs. 73.1%, p = 0.18) or adverse events between the groups. Patients receiving a WB dose were significantly more likely to have a HR < 100 bpm than those receiving a NWB dose (40.9% vs. 53.5%, p = 0.01). When groups were defined by IBW, WB dosing was associated with a significantly higher incidence of achieving a therapeutic response (62.7% vs. 74.3%, p = 0.02).

Conclusion

In patients presenting with AF with RVR, there was no significant difference in achieving a therapeutic response between the two strategies. A WB dosing approach did result in a greater proportion of patients with a HR < 100 bpm. The utilization of IBW for WB dosing may result in an increased achievement of a therapeutic response.

### Diltiazem hci [^111bBdbB]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

In patients with atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter, a significant correlation was observed between the percent reduction in HR and plasma diltiazem concentration using the Sigmoidal Emax model. Based on this relationship, the mean plasma diltiazem concentration required to produce a 20% decrease in heart rate was determined to be 80 ng/mL. Mean plasma diltiazem concentrations of 130 ng/mL and 300 ng/mL were determined to produce reductions in heart rate of 30% and 40%.

Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism

Following a single intravenous injection in healthy male volunteers, diltiazem hydrochloride appears to obey linear pharmacokinetics over a dose range of 10.5 to 21 mg. The plasma elimination half-life is approximately 3.4 hours. The apparent volume of distribution of diltiazem hydrochloride is approximately 305 L. Diltiazem hydrochloride is extensively metabolized in the liver with a systemic clearance of approximately 65 L/h.

After constant rate intravenous infusion to healthy male volunteers, diltiazem exhibits nonlinear pharmacokinetics over an infusion range of 4.8 to 13.2 mg/h for 24 hours. Over this infusion range, as the dose is increased, systemic clearance decreases from 64 to 48 L/h while the plasma elimination half-life increases from 4.1 to 4.9 hours. The apparent volume of distribution remains unchanged (360 to 391 L). In patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, diltiazem systemic clearance has been found to be decreased compared to healthy volunteers. In patients administered bolus doses ranging from 2.5 mg to 38.5 mg, systemic clearance averaged 36 L/h. In patients administered continuous infusions at 10 mg/h or 15 mg/h for 24 hours, diltiazem systemic clearance averaged 42 L/h and 31 L/h, respectively.

If not hemodynamically stable, rhythm control specifies "Synchronized cardioversion (Class I)", whereas rate control lists "IV amiodarone (Class IIb)".

Atrial fibrillation acute rate control — comparative trials report that "Intravenous diltiazem was more effective than intravenous digoxin in 2 small RCTs.6,7" In one emergency department trial, investigators "randomized 150 patients with AF without major comorbidities and a ventricular rate > 120 bpm in a 1:1:1 ratio to intravenous diltiazem, digoxin, and amiodarone.6" with "time to reduce the heart rate < 90 bpm" shorter with diltiazem. Another RCT of "30 patients" found diltiazem "significantly decreased heart rate within 5 minutes versus 3 hours with intravenous digoxin.7" Diltiazem also reduced rate "more rapidly than intravenous digoxin in a double-blinded RCT in 40 patients with rapid AF after CABG, with similar control at 12 to 24 hours". Additional evidence shows "In another RCT of 84 patients in rapid AF who presented to the emergency department, intravenous amiodarone resulted in faster control of the ventricular response compared with intravenous digoxin.8" and "Finally, 52 patients with rapid AF were randomized to receive either an intravenous combination of diltiazem and digoxin or intravenous diltiazem alone, with a more rapid and durable response to the combination.9"

### Diltiazem hci [^113B1CAL]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

In domestic controlled trials in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, bolus administration of diltiazem hydrochloride injection was effective in reducing heart rate by at least 20% in 95% of patients. Diltiazem hydrochloride injection rarely converts atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter to normal sinus rhythm. Following administration of one or two intravenous bolus doses of diltiazem hydrochloride injection, response usually occurs within 3 minutes and maximal heart rate reduction generally occurs in 2 to 7 minutes. Heart rate reduction may last from 1 to 3 hours. If hypotension occurs, it is generally short-lived, but may last from 1 to 3 hours.

A 24-hour continuous infusion of diltiazem hydrochloride injection in the treatment of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter maintained at least a 20% heart rate reduction during the infusion in 83% of patients. Upon discontinuation of infusion, heart rate reduction may last from 0.5 hours to more than 10 hours (median duration 7 hours). Hypotension, if it occurs, may be similarly persistent.

In the controlled clinical trials, 3.2% of patients required some form of intervention (typically, use of intravenous fluids or the Trendelenburg position) for blood pressure support following diltiazem hydrochloride injection.

In domestic controlled trials, bolus administration of diltiazem hydrochloride injection was effective in converting PSVT to normal sinus rhythm in 88% of patients within 3 minutes of the first or second bolus dose.

Symptoms associated with the arrhythmia were improved in conjunction with decreased heart rate or conversion to normal sinus rhythm following administration of diltiazem hydrochloride injection.

### Atrial fibrillation in heart failure: what should we do? [^116Kz6Bc]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Calcium channel blockers

Non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (verapamil or diltiazem) are not recommended in patients with significantly impaired left ventricular function due to their negative inotropic effects, although specific data are limited. In the Multicenter Diltiazem Postinfarction Trial, patients were randomized to diltiazem or placebo 3–15 days after the onset of myocardial infarction.HF patients, including 490 with evidence of pulmonary congestion, had an increase in the composite of cardiac death or non-fatal re-infarction (HR 1.41, 95% CI 1.01–1.96). In subsequent analysis, diltiazem was found to increase late-onset HF in those with LVEF < 40%. Verapamil did not improve outcomes after myocardial infarction in patients who developed HF in the Danish Verapamil Infarction Trials.

Heart rate targets for atrial fibrillation in the context of heart failure and reduced ejection fraction

Following the publication of the Rate Control Efficacy in Permanent Atrial Fibrillation (RACE II) trial, patients with AF can initially be treated to a more lenient heart rate regime (< 110 beats/min resting heart rate). To summarize, 614 patients with permanent AF were randomized to a heart rate < 80 b.p.m. at rest and < 110 b.p.m. during moderate exercise or lenient control, with results showing a similar rate of composite clinical events in each arm. There were also no differences in functional outcomes, hospital admissions, or symptoms. Fifteen percent of the population had LVEF < 40% but it remains unclear if these targets apply to AF patients with HFrEF. However, these findings are consistent with other results, and would suggest that heart rate in AF is more a marker of disease than a therapeutic target and that a lenient heart rate may be acceptable if symptoms are controlled and tachycardia is avoided. It is worth noting that other guideline recommendations continue to advocate a resting heart rate < 80 b.p.m. in patients with symptomatic AF and left ventricular dysfunction.

Specific rhythm-control strategies

Cardioversion

The first step in rhythm control is the restoration of sinus rhythm, which often requires cardioversion. Urgent cardioversion is recommended in any patient with significant haemodynamic impairment secondary to AF. Elective cardioversion is indicated in individuals with symptomatic persistent AF. Unfortunately, recurrence of AF after successful cardioversion is a frequent problem (∼50% at 6 months), particularly in patients with HF. Over half of inpatients undergoing cardioversion for atrial arrhythmias have HF.

### Adenosine versus fixed-dose intravenous bolus diltiazem on reversing supraventricular tachycardia in the emergency department: a multi-center cohort study [^117FTiPK]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is a common and therapeutically challenging cardiac dysrhythmia in the emergency department (ED). Adenosine and diltiazem are the most used pharmacological agents for SVT management, but few comparative studies exist.

Objective

To compare the efficacy of bolus intravenous (IV) adenosine versus diltiazem in the termination of spontaneous SVT.

Methods

This was a multicenter, retrospective, cohort study conducted in EDs in North Texas. Eligible subjects were adult patients presenting with stable SVT who received either a bolus of IV adenosine or diltiazem as the initial treatment. The primary outcome was the rate of successful conversion, which was defined as a sustained sinus rhythm within 30 min of the initial treatment. Secondary outcomes included time to conversion and response doses.

Results

A total of 344 cases were incorporated into the final analysis, 310 in the adenosine-first group and 34 in the diltiazem-first group. The rate of successful conversion trended higher for diltiazem; however, the difference was not significantly different (66.8% adenosine, 82.4% diltiazem, p = 0.08). The median time to conversion was significantly shorter for the adenosine group (3.0 min) to the diltiazem group (6.0 min, p = 0.02), with median response dosages of 12 mg and 15 mg, respectively. Of the cases that failed adenosine monotherapy, 18 (35%) were successfully rescued by diltiazem. Diltiazem also successfully controlled 77% of conversions to atrial fibrillation (AF) or flutter without hypotensive events.

Conclusion

This study showed that diltiazem and adenosine had similar conversion rates. In addition, diltiazem effectively rescued cases not responsive to adenosine.

### Comparison of weight-based dose vs. standard dose diltiazem in patients with atrial fibrillation presenting to the emergency department [^1114fh3d]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Despite evidence-based recommended weight-based (WB) dosing of diltiazem for the initial treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular response (RVR), many providers utilize lower initial doses of diltiazem.

Objective

We sought to determine whether a low, standard dose of diltiazem is noninferior to WB diltiazem as an initial bolus dose in the treatment of AF with RVR.

Methods

This retrospective review included patients who presented to the emergency department (ED) of an urban, academic tertiary medical center experiencing AF with RVR from November 2010 to August 2014. Adult patients were categorized by the dose of diltiazem received; 10 mg standard dose or 0.2–0.3 mg/kg WB dose. The primary outcome of successful treatment was defined as a composite of the following parameters 15 min after the initial bolus dose: heart rate (HR) < 100 beats/min, reduction of HR ≥ 20%, or a conversion to normal sinus rhythm.

Results

Four hundred and fifty-six patients who received diltiazem were included for study evaluation (standard dose: n = 255 patients, WB: n = 201 patients). Baseline characteristics, medical history, and medication use before ED presentation were similar between the groups. Significant differences at baseline between the groups included weight and HR at presentation. The primary outcome of successful treatment was attained in 60.8% of the standard dose patients and 68.7% of the WB patients (p = 0.082).

Conclusions

In patients presenting to the ED, we found that standard dose diltiazem was noninferior to WB dosing in the initial treatment of AF with RVR.

### Acute management of atrial fibrillation in congestive heart failure with reduced ejection fraction in the emergency department [^1169NLP5]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute heart rate control for atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular response (RVR) in the emergency department (ED) is often achieved utilizing intravenous (IV) non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (CCB) or beta blockers (BB). For patients with concomitant heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), the American Heart Association and other clinical groups note that CCB should be avoided due to their potential negative inotropic effects. However, minimal evidence exists to guide this current recommendation. The primary objective of this study was to compare the incidence of adverse effects in the HFrEF patient population whose AF with RVR was treated with IV diltiazem or metoprolol in the ED.

Methods

This single center, retrospective review included patients ≥ 18 years old with HFrEF who presented in AF with RVR and received IV diltiazem or metoprolol in the ED. The primary outcome was adverse effects of therapy defined as: 1) hypotension (systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg requiring fluid bolus or vasopressors) or bradycardia (heart rate < 60 beats/min) within 60 min of medication administration 2) worsening heart failure symptoms defined as increased oxygen requirements within four hours or inotropic support within 48 h. Secondary outcomes included the incidence of rate control failure, patient disposition, ED length of stay, hospital length of stay, and in-hospital mortality.

Results

One hundred and twenty-five patients met inclusion criteria, with 57 receiving diltiazem and 68 receiving metoprolol. Overall adverse effects for diltiazem and metoprolol were similar (32% vs. 21%, P = 0.217). However, there was a significantly higher incidence of worsening heart failure symptoms within the diltiazem group (33% vs 15%, P = 0.019). Rate control failure at 60 min did not differ significantly between diltiazem and metoprolol (51% vs 62%, P = 0.277).

Conclusions

In HFrEF patients with AF, there was no difference in total adverse events in patients treated with IV diltiazem compared to metoprolol. However, the diltiazem group had a higher incidence of worsening CHF symptoms defined as increased oxygen requirement within four hours or initiation of inotropic support within 48 h.

### Diltiazem hydrochloride (DILTIAZEM HYDROCHLORIDE in SODIUM CHLORIDE) [^115nCuxs]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 General Considerations

Administer intravenous diltiazem in a setting with continuous monitoring of the ECG and frequent measurement of blood pressure. A defibrillator and emergency equipment should be readily available.

Diltiazem Hydrochloride in Sodium Chloride Injection is a ready to administer product that requires no further dilution prior to infusion. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit.

2.2 Intravenous Single Injection

The initial dose of diltiazem hydrochloride should be 0.25 mg/kg actual body weight administered over 2 minutes (20 mg is a reasonable dose for the average patient). If response is inadequate, a second dose may be administered after 15 minutes. The second dose of diltiazem hydrochloride should be 0.35 mg/kg actual body weight administered over 2 minutes (25 mg is a reasonable dose for the average patient). Subsequent intravenous bolus doses should be individualized.

2.3 Continuous Intravenous Infusion

Immediately following bolus, the recommended initial infusion rate of diltiazem hydrochloride is 5 mg/hour. Adjust the infusion rate in 5 mg/hour increments up to a maximum of 15 mg/hour as needed to achieve satisfactory rate control. Infusions longer than 24 hours have not been studied. Patients should generally be transitioned to other antiarrhythmic agents within 24 hours [see Clinical Studies (14)].

2.4 Physical Incompatibilities

Do not mix diltiazem hydrochloride with any other drugs in the same container. If possible, use a dedicated line for diltiazem hydrochloride.

Diltiazem hydrochloride has demonstrated physical incompatibilities with acetazolamide, acyclovir, aminophylline, ampicillin, ampicillin sodium/sulbactam sodium, cefamandole, cefoperazone, diazepam, furosemide, hydrocortisone sodium succinate, insulin (regular: 100 units/mL), methylprednisolone sodium succinate, mezlocillin, nafcillin, phenytoin, rifampin, and sodium bicarbonate.

Atrial fibrillation with heart failure — rate control pharmacotherapy: In RATE-AF, 160 patients (≥ 60 years) with persistent AF and HF (81% with LVEF ≥ 50%) were randomized to digoxin or bisoprolol; there was no significant difference in the primary QOL endpoint at 6 months, secondary outcomes (including natriuretic peptides) were lower with digoxin, resting heart rate did not differ at 12 months, and adverse effects were less common with digoxin. Post hoc analyses in HF on chronic digoxin associated serum digoxin levels ≥ 1 ng/mL with increased mortality and hospitalization, whereas levels < 0.8 ng/mL were associated with the lowest mortality rate. In DAAF, among 239 patients (12% with HF), intravenous digoxin significantly decreased heart rate at 2 hours versus placebo. In critically ill patients, a randomized trial of 60 patients (13 with HF) showed significant rate control with both intravenous diltiazem and amiodarone, with a higher frequency of hypotension requiring discontinuation with diltiazem; a retrospective intensive care unit series of 38 patients (9 with HF) found intravenous amiodarone lowered ventricular rate without BP decrease compared with intravenous diltiazem and digoxin. The text cautions that intravenous beta blockers may cause hypotension in hemodynamic instability, that intravenous amiodarone can also be associated with hypotension (especially with bolus), and that the possibility of conversion to sinus rhythm and thromboembolism should factor into risk–benefit decisions when choosing intravenous amiodarone for rate control.

### Intravenous diltiazem infusions for rapid atrial fibrillation or flutter in the emergency department: a retrospective, exploratory analysis [^112ZnihR]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Emergency physicians commonly treat patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) or atrial flutter (AFL) with rapid ventricular response, and intravenous (IV) diltiazem is the most commonly used medication for rate control of such patients. We sought to compare rate control success and safety outcomes for emergency department (ED) patients with AF or AFL who, after a diltiazem bolus, received a diltiazem drip compared to those who did not receive a drip.

Methods

We performed a retrospective cohort study comparing outcomes of ED patients from a single hospital system with AF and AFL and a heart rate (HR) > 100 beats/min who received a diltiazem drip after an IV diltiazem bolus to those who received no drip. The primary outcome was a HR < 100 beats/min at the time of ED disposition. Secondary outcomes were hospital length of stay and safety (hypotension, electrical cardioversion, vasopressor use, and death). We compared groups using propensity score matching.

Results

Between January 1, 2020, and November 8, 2022, there were 746 AF or AFL patients eligible for analysis. Of those, 382 (51.2%) received a diltiazem drip and 364 (48.8%) did not. In the unadjusted analysis, the last recorded ED HR was < 100 beats/min in 55.2% of patients in the drip group compared to 65.9% in the no-drip group (difference 10.7%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.7 to 17.7). After propensity matching, diltiazem drip use was associated with lower likelihood of rate control in the ED (OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.48–0.99) and 22.5h (95% CI 12.2–36.8) longer hospital stay.

Conclusions

For patients with AF or AFL, the use of a diltiazem drip after an IV diltiazem bolus was associated with less rate control in the ED.

### Evaluation of diltiazem dosing strategies in the management of atrial fibrillation in the emergency department [^111nKZr6]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To compare the incidence of treatment failure between oral (PO) immediate release (IR) tablet and continuous intravenous infusion (CIVI) diltiazem following an initial loading dose in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular response (RVR).

Methods

This single center, retrospective cohort study evaluated patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) from July 1, 2022 to June 30, 2022 in AF with RVR who received oral or continuous diltiazem after an initial intravenous loading dose. The primary objective of this study is to identify the percentage of patients with treatment failure four hours after initiation of diltiazem IR PO tablet or continuous IV infusion. Secondary endpoints included hospital length of stay (LOS), ED disposition, and clinically significant hypotension.

Results

Of the 171 patients included, 85 received PO IR diltiazem and 86 received CIVI diltiazem. There was no significant difference in the composite outcome of treatment failure between the PO and CIVI groups (60% vs 59%, p = 0.93). Patients who received PO diltiazem were more frequently discharged from the ED (31.8% vs 4.7%, p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in hospital LOS (6.6 vs 6.5 days, p = 0.06) or clinically significant hypotension (11.7% vs 8.1% p = 0.428).

Conclusion

Initiating immediate-release oral diltiazem after an initial IV bolus does not result in more treatment failures than initiating a continuous infusion.

### Evaluation of metoprolol versus diltiazem for rate control of atrial fibrillation in the emergency department [^1154hvrQ]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness and safety of the metoprolol and diltiazem administration in the Emergency Department (ED) for rate control of supraventricular tachycardia.

Methods

This was a retrospective cohort study of adult patients who presented to the ED with ventricular rates ≥ 120 beats per minute (bpm) and who received bolus doses of either intravenous metoprolol or intravenous diltiazem. The primary outcome was achievement of rate control, defined as heart rate < 110 bpm, at two hours after administration of the last bolus dose of metoprolol or diltiazem. Safety outcomes included occurrence of hypotension, defined as systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure < 60 mmHg, and bradycardia, defined as heart rate < 60 bpm.

Results

There were 166 patients receiving metoprolol and 183 patients receiving diltiazem included in the study. The primary outcome, rate control at two hours after the last bolus dose of metoprolol or diltiazem was similar between the two groups (45.8% vs 42.6%, p = 0.590, respectively). The percentage of patients achieving rate control was also similar (47.0% vs 41.6%, p = 0.333) at one hour. At 0.5 h HR had a significantly greater numerical (diltiazem: 29.3 ± 23.1 bpm vs metoprolol: 21.8 ± 18.9 bpm, p = 0.012) and percent decrease (21.1% vs 15.94%, p = 0.014) in the diltiazem group compared to metoprolol. There was no significant difference in occurrence of bradycardia in the two groups (diltiazem: 3.83% vs metoprolol: 1.2%, p = 0.179). More patients in the diltiazem group compared to the metoprolol group experienced hypotension (39.3% vs 23.5%, p = 0.002). The difference in systolic hypotension events was not significantly different (9.29% vs 5.42%, p = 0.221), while the difference in diastolic hypotension events was significantly different (37.7% vs 22.3%, p = 0.002).

Conclusion

There was no difference in acute rate control effectiveness two hours after the last bolus dose of diltiazem and metoprolol for supraventricular tachycardias. There was a significantly higher occurrence of hypotension in the diltiazem group which was driven by higher rates of diastolic blood pressures less than 60 mmHg.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

In domestic controlled trials in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, bolus administration of diltiazem hydrochloride injection was effective in reducing heart rate by at least 20% in 95% of patients. Diltiazem hydrochloride injection rarely converts atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter to normal sinus rhythm. Following administration of one or two intravenous bolus doses of diltiazem injection, response usually occurs within 3 minutes and maximal heart rate reduction generally occurs in 2 to 7 minutes. Heart rate reduction may last from 1 to 3 hours. If hypotension occurs, it is generally short-lived, but may last from 1 to 3 hours.

A 24-hour continuous infusion of diltiazem injection in the treatment of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter maintained at least a 20% heart rate reduction during the infusion in 83% of patients. Upon discontinuation of infusion, heart rate reduction may last from 0.5 hours to more than 10 hours (median duration 7 hours). Hypotension, if it occurs, may be similarly persistent.

In the controlled clinical trials, 3.2% of patients required some form of intervention (typically, use of intravenous fluids or the Trendelenburg position) for blood pressure support following diltiazem hydrochloride injection.

In domestic controlled trials, bolus administration of diltiazem hydrochloride injection was effective in converting PSVT to normal sinus rhythm in 88% of patients within 3 minutes of the first or second bolus dose.

Symptoms associated with the arrhythmia were improved in conjunction with decreased heart rate or conversion to normal sinus rhythm following administration of diltiazem hydrochloride injection.

In controlled clinical trials, therapy with antiarrhythmic agents to maintain reduced heart rate in atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter or for prophylaxis of PSVT was generally started within 3 hours after bolus administration of diltiazem hydrochloride. These antiarrhythmic agents were intravenous or oral digoxin, Class 1 antiarrhythmics (e.g., quinidine, procainamide), calcium channel blockers, and oral beta-blockers.

### Reducing diltiazem-related hypotension in atrial fibrillation: role of pretreatment intravenous calcium [^111pupkx]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This study evaluated the efficacy of intravenous (IV) calcium pretreatment for preventing diltiazem-induced hypotension and assessed its safety in adult patients with atrial fibrillation (AF)/atrial flutter (AFL) with rapid ventricular response (RVR).

Methods

This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial included 217 adults with AF/AFL and a ventricular rate > 120 beats per minute, who were randomized into three groups: those who received an IV NaCl 0.9% placebo pretreatment prior to IV diltiazem (PD; 73 patients) and those who received 90 mg (C90D; 71 patients) and 180 mg (C180D; 73 patients) IV calcium chloride pretreatment before IV diltiazem. We compared participants' systolic blood pressure (SBP) and heart rate (HR) at baseline and at 5, 10, and 15 min post-treatment, as well as the incidence of adverse events (e.g., hypotension, urticaria, nausea) among the groups.

Results

The PD and C90D pretreatment groups had significantly lower HR measurements at 10 and 15 min compared to the C180D group. In addition, at 5 min, the mean SBP in the PD group was significantly lower compared to the C90D and C180D groups. At 10 min, the mean SBP was significantly higher in the C180D group than in the other groups. Furthermore, at 15 min, the mean SBP was significantly higher in both the C90D and C180D groups than in the PD group. There were no significant differences between the calcium pretreatment and placebo groups in terms of the need for additional diltiazem doses or the incidence of adverse events.

Conclusion

IV calcium pretreatment effectively prevents diltiazem-induced hypotension in patients with AF/AFL with RVR without compromising the efficacy of diltiazem in achieving and maintaining ventricular rate control.

### Metoprolol vs diltiazem for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate: systematic review and meta-analysis of adverse events [^112GLsyE]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Intravenous (IV) diltiazem and metoprolol are commonly used to achieve rate control for atrial fibrillation with RVR (Afib with RVR), and are both recommended as first-line by current guidelines. While prior studies investigated the efficacy of these medications, there is little evidence available regarding the risk of adverse events (AEs) with their use.

Methods

We identified randomized controlled trials (RCT) and observational studies reporting rates of AEs following administration of IV diltiazem and metoprolol for Afib with RVR by searching PubMed, SCOPUS, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library. Our primary outcome was the incidence of AEs and specifically hypotension and bradycardia, which were examined individually as secondary outcomes. We performed random-effects meta-analysis to identify rates of each AE. We used moderator analysis and meta-regressions to evaluate risk factors. We used the Cochrane Risk-of-Bias 2 tool and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale to assess study quality.

Results

We reviewed 13 studies and included 1660 patients, 888 (53%) treated with metoprolol and 772 (47%) with diltiazem. Metoprolol was associated with a 26% lower risk of AE (total incidence 10%) compared to diltiazem (total incidence 19%), (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.56–0.98, p = 0.034) with a prediction interval of 0.50–1.10. Patients with higher initial heart rates faced higher rates of AEs (Correlation Coefficient 0.11, 95% CI 0.03–0.19, p = 0.006). There was no difference with respect to rates of bradycardia (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.15–1.30, p = 0.14) or hypotension (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.61–1.04, p = 0.10).

Conclusion

Afib with RVR treated with metoprolol had lower rates of AE (bradycardia and/or hypotension) compared to those treated with diltiazem. We found no difference in rates of hypotension or bradycardia when individually assessed. Existing data are limited by small sample sizes, variability in dosing, and limited representation of important patient subgroups.

### Acute rate control with metoprolol versus diltiazem in atrial fibrillation with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction [^1117qHaG]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Compare heart rate control between parenteral metoprolol and diltiazem and identify safety outcomes in the acute management of atrial fibrillation (AFib) with rapid ventricular response (RVR) in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).

Methods

This retrospective, single-center, cohort study included adult patients with HFrEF who received intravenous (IV) metoprolol or diltiazem for AFib RVR in the emergency department (ED). The primary outcome was rate control defined as HR < 100 bpm or a HR reduction ≥ 20% within 30 min of first dose administration. The secondary outcomes included rate control within 60 min and 120 min from first dose, need for repeat dosing, and disposition. Safety outcomes included hypotensive and bradycardic events.

Results

Out of 552 patients, 45 patients met the inclusion criteria with 15 in the metoprolol group and 30 in the diltiazem group. Using bootstrapping method, patients treated with metoprolol were equally able to reach the primary outcome as those treated with diltiazem (BCa 95% CI: 0.14, 4.31). Hypotensive and bradycardia events remained zero in both groups.

Conclusion

Our study provides further evidence that short term use of diltiazem is likely as safe and effective as metoprolol in the acute management of HFrEF patients with AFib RVR and provides support for the use of non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (non-DHP CCBs) in this patient population.

1.4 Arrhythmias, atrial fibrillation

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common cardiac arrhythmia seen in older adults with prevalence increasing with age. 43 The primary goals of AF management include prevention of thromboembolic events, primarily ischemic stroke, and reduction of symptoms and hospitalizations. 43

Anticoagulation: Systemic anticoagulation should be considered in all patients with atrial fibrillation; however, concern over falls and subsequent bleeding may lead to under‐prescribing. Implementation of the HAS‐BLED and CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc scores may help guide pharmacotherapy decision‐making. 44, 45 Newer agents such as the direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are now considered the preferred option demonstrating similar efficacy in preventing stroke and systemic embolism, with a lower risk of major bleeding compared to warfarin. 46 Warfarin also seems to be associated with increased risk of osteoporotic fractures compared to the DOACs. 47 All DOACs require dose adjustments for renal function. Apixaban is often considered the preferred agent for older adults, as it has lower renal excretion than dabigatran and rivaroxaban. For those with end stage renal disease, either apixaban or warfarin is reasonable.

Rate vs rhythm control: Symptomatic management of AF consists of either rhythm control or rate control. Rhythm control was shown to be inferior to rate control with respect to mortality in older adults and is associated with more adverse drug events and hospitalizations. 48 Moreover, antiarrhythmic agents use is limited in this population due to co‐morbidities including structural heart disease, heart failure, and renal dysfunction. Amiodarone may often be the only appropriate option, although its use is associated with many long term side effects. Once AF becomes permanent and the decision to pursue rate control is made, all antiarrhythmic agents should be discontinued. Rate control is usually achieved with beta‐blockers, or a nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (CCB) such as diltiazem. 49 Atenolol should be avoided in this population due to its renal excretion. Digoxin may also be used for rate control when hypotension limits beta‐blocker or CCB use, but it requires strict monitoring to ensure therapeutic drug levels. Chronic digoxin use appears to be associated with increased mortality. 50 Therefore, initiation of digoxin therapy in older adults with atrial fibrillation alone should generally be avoided when possible.

### Hemodynamic comparison of intravenous push diltiazem versus metoprolol for atrial fibrillation rate control [^115j9vYP]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Intravenous push (IVP) diltiazem and metoprolol are commonly used for management of atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular rate (RVR) in the emergency department (ED). This study's objective was to determine if there was a significant difference in blood pressure reduction between agents.

Methods

This was a single-center, retrospective study of adult patients initially treated with IVP diltiazem or metoprolol in the ED from 2008 to 2018. Primary endpoint was mean reduction in systolic blood pressure (SBP) from baseline to nadir during the study period. Study period was defined as time from first dose of IVP intervention to 30 min after last dose of IVP intervention or first dose of maintenance therapy, whichever came first.

Results

A total of 63 diltiazem patients and 45 metoprolol patients met eligibility criteria. Baseline characteristics were similar except for initial ventricular rate (VR) and home beta-blocker use. Median dose of initial intervention was 10 [10–20] mg and 5 [5–5] mg for diltiazem and metoprolol respectively. Mean SBP reduction was 18 ± 22 mmHg for diltiazem compared to 14 ± 15 mmHg for metoprolol (p = .33). Clinically relevant hypotension was similar between groups 14% vs. 16% (p = .86). Rate control was achieved in 35 (56%) of the diltiazem group and 16 (36%) of the metoprolol group (p = .04).

Conclusion

IVP diltiazem and metoprolol caused similar SBP reduction and hypotension when used for initial management of AF with RVR in the ED. However, rate control was achieved more often with diltiazem.

### Comparison of sustained rate control in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate: metoprolol vs. diltiazem [^117Nsyuh]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to compare sustained rate control with intravenous (IV) diltiazem vs. IV metoprolol in acute treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular rate (RVR) in the emergency department (ED).

Methods

This retrospective chart review at a large, academic medical center identified patients with AF with RVR diagnosis who received IV diltiazem or IV metoprolol in the ED. The primary outcome was sustained rate control defined as heart rate (HR) < 100 beats per minute without need for rescue IV medication for 3 h following initial rate control attainment. Secondary outcomes included time to initial rate control, HR at initial control and 3 h, time to oral dose, admission rates, and safety outcomes.

Results

Between January 1, 2016 and November 1, 2018, 51 patients met inclusion criteria (diltiazem n = 32, metoprolol n = 19). No difference in sustained rate control was found (diltiazem 87.5% vs. metoprolol 78.9%, p = 0.45). Time to rate control was significantly shorter with diltiazem compared to metoprolol (15 min vs. 30 min, respectively, p = 0.04). Neither hypotension nor bradycardia were significantly different between groups.

Conclusions

Choice of rate control agent for acute management of AF with RVR did not significantly influence sustained rate control success. Safety outcomes did not differ between treatment groups.

### Diltiazem hydrochloride (DILTIAZEM HYDROCHLORIDE in SODIUM CHLORIDE) [^116goSw5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Intravenous diltiazem hydrochloride 20 mg prolongs AH conduction time and AV node functional and effective refractory periods by approximately 20%. PR in healthy volunteers and HR in patients with atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter are dependent on plasma level of diltiazem. Based on this relationship, the mean plasma diltiazem concentration required to produce a 20%, 30% and 40% decrease in heart rate was determined to be 80 ng/mL, 130 ng/mL and 300 ng/mL, respectively.

In patients with cardiovascular disease, diltiazem hydrochloride administered intravenously in single bolus doses, followed in some cases by a continuous infusion, reduced blood pressure, systemic vascular resistance, the rate-pressure product, and coronary vascular resistance and increased coronary blood flow. In a limited number of studies of patients with compromised myocardium (severe congestive heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), administration of intravenous diltiazem produced no significant effect on contractility, left ventricular end diastolic pressure, or pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. The mean ejection fraction and cardiac output/index remained unchanged or increased. Maximal hemodynamic effects usually occurred within 2 to 5 minutes of an injection. However, in rare instances, worsening of congestive heart failure has been reported in patients with preexisting impaired ventricular function.

Circulation (2011). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation — dronedarone safety, interactions, and dosing are detailed as follows: In patients with recently decompensated heart failure and depressed LV function, dronedarone increased mortality after a median follow-up of only 2 months; 8.1% in the dronedarone group died and 3.8% in the placebo group died (HR 2.13; 95% CI, 1.07 to 4.25; P = 0.03). Therefore, dronedarone should not be administered to patients with depressed ventricular function and recent heart failure decompensation or NYHA class IV heart failure. The major adverse cardiac effects are bradycardia and QT prolongation, and torsades de pointes has been reported. Dronedarone inhibits renal tubular secretion of creatinine without reducing glomerular filtration rate and increases digoxin levels 1.7- to 2.5-fold. It is predominantly metabolized by CYP3A4 with a half-life of approximately 19 hours; it should not be administered with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 but can be administered with verapamil or diltiazem using low initial doses titrated to response and tolerance. Dronedarone does not alter the international normalization ratio when used with warfarin. The recommended oral dose is 400 mg twice a day with meals, and an intravenous form is not available.

### DOsing strategy effectiveness of diltiazem in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response [^1174Gczn]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

To evaluate the dose-dependent comparative safety and effectiveness between weight-based and alternative dosing strategies for diltiazem in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study included adult patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response who received treatment with intravenous diltiazem. Groups were retrospectively categorized according to the initial dose: low (< 0.1875 mg/kg), weight-based (0.1875 to 0.3125 mg/kg), and high (> 0.3125 mg/kg). The primary outcome was rate control (heart rate < 100 beats/min) within 30 minutes of treatment.

Results

Of 345 records, 252 were included. Because of scarcity (N = 6), outcomes for the high-dose group were not analyzed. By 30 minutes, the weight-based dosing group had more often achieved rate control (weight-based 55%; low 27%; difference 29% [95% confidence interval (CI) 17% to 40%]). Regression analysis identified the weight-based dosing group (odds ratio 3.63, 95% CI 2.06 to 6.39) and initial heart rate of less than 145 beats/min (odds ratio 2.56, 95% CI 1.46 to 4.51) as variables associated with the primary outcome. The weight-based dosing group less often required rescue therapy (weight-based 6%; low 17%; difference -12% [95% CI -20% to -4%]) relative to the low-dose group. Mortality was higher in the low-dose group than in the weight-based dosing group (low 7%; weight-based 1%; difference 6% [95% CI 1% to 11%]).

Conclusion

This study shows dose-dependent hemodynamic effects with diltiazem in patients with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Weight-based diltiazem (0.25 mg/kg) was associated with greater rate control with no evidence of increased adverse effects. There was no perceived advantage in using lower, alternative doses.

### Impact of intravenous calcium with diltiazem for atrial fibrillation / flutter in the emergency department [^116bHtap]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of early intravenous (IV) calcium on systolic blood pressure (SBP) when administered with IV diltiazem in subjects with atrial fibrillation (AF) or flutter (AFL) with rapid ventricular response (RVR) in the Emergency Department (ED).

Methods

This was a multicenter, retrospective cohort study that evaluated adults admitted to the ED with documented AF or AFL, heart rate (HR) > 120 bpm, SBP 90 to 140 mmHg, and received treatment with IV diltiazem for rate control. The primary outcome was the change in SBP 60 min (± 30 min) after initial IV diltiazem administration. Secondary outcomes included time to initial rate control (HR < 100 bpm), time to sustained rate control (HR < 100 bpm for 3 h), change in HR, rates of hypotension, bradycardia, hypercalcemia, and line extravasation within 24 h of initial diltiazem administration.

Results

There were 198 subjects in the diltiazem monotherapy group and 56 subjects in the diltiazem with calcium group meeting the inclusion criteria. The primary outcome, median change in SBP 60 min after initial IV diltiazem administration, was similar between groups (-2 mmHg vs -1.5 mmHg; p = 0.642), but this difference was not statistically significant. All secondary outcomes were found to be similar between groups. Although not statistically significant, hypotension occurred more often in the diltiazem with calcium group (20.2% vs 32.1%; p = 0.060) while bradycardia occurred more often in the diltiazem monotherapy group (4.5% vs 0%; p = 0.213). In terms of achieving rate control, the administration of calcium with diltiazem did not significantly change the time to initial rate control (1.4 h vs 1.8 h; p = 0.141) or time to sustained rate control (7.9 h vs 7.7 h; p = 0.570) compared to diltiazem alone.

Conclusions

In the setting of AF/AFL with RVR, administration of IV calcium with IV diltiazem did not show a significant impact on clinical or safety outcomes compared to IV diltiazem monotherapy.

Recommendation-specific supportive evidence — randomized trials of acute rate control report the following quantitative results: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of continuous intravenous diltiazem infusion for 24-hour heart rate control during AF and AFL, seventeen of the 23 patients (74%) receiving diltiazem infusion and none of the 21 with placebo infusion maintained a therapeutic response for 24 hours. In another randomized clinical trial of intravenous diltiazem, digoxin, or amiodarone for ventricular rate control, at 24 hours, rate control was achieved in 119 of 150 patients (79%), and the percentage who achieved rate control was higher in the diltiazem group (90%) than the digoxin group (74%) and the amiodarone group (74%). In a randomized, parallel, open-label study of esmolol versus verapamil in acute AF or AFL, fifty percent of esmolol-treated patients with new onset of arrhythmias converted to sinus rhythm, whereas only 12% of those who received verapamil converted, with mild hypotension observed in both treatment groups.

### Amiodarone versus diltiazem for rate control in critically ill patients with atrial tachyarrhythmias [^1137oYJU]. Critical Care Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the rate-lowering effect of diltiazem and two amiodarone regimens in critically ill patients with recent-onset atrial tachyarrhythmias.

Design

Prospective, randomized, controlled study.

Setting

Medical cardiologic intensive care unit in a university hospital.

Patients

Sixty critically ill patients (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation [APACHE] III score 70 ± 30, age 67 ± 10 yrs).

Interventions

Patients with atrial fibrillation (n = 57), atrial flutter (n = 2), or atrial tachycardia (n = 1, and a heart rate consistently > 120 beats/min over 30 mins were randomly assigned to one of three intravenous treatment regimens. Group 1 received diltiazem in a 25-mg bolus followed by a continuous infusion of 20 mg/hr for 24 hrs, group 2 received amiodarone in a 300-mg bolus, and group 3 received amiodarone in a 300-mg bolus followed by 45 mg/hr for 24 hrs.

Measurements and Main Results

The primary study end point was a > 30% rate reduction within 4 hrs. The secondary study end point was a heart rate < 120 beats/min (a patient was considered to have uncontrolled tachycardia if heart rate was > 120 beats/min 4 hrs after study drug). The primary study end point was achieved in 14/20 (70%), 11/20 (55%), and 15/20 (75%) of patients in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively (chi2 = 1.95, p = .38). Uncontrolled tachycardia was more frequently observed in group 2 (0/20, 9/29 [55%], and 1/20 [5%] of patients in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively; chi2 = 17, p = .00016). In patients achieving tachycardia control, diltiazem showed a significantly better rate reduction (p = .0001 group 1 vs. group 3, p = .0001 over time; p = .0001 group 1 vs. group 2, p = .001 over time) when compared with the amiodarone groups. Premature drug discontinuation due to hypotension was required significantly more often in group 1 (6/20 [30%], 0/20, and 1/20 [5%] for groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively; chi2 = 10, p = .01).

Conclusion

Sufficient rate control can be achieved in critically ill patients with atrial tachyarrhythmias using either diltiazem or amiodarone. Although diltiazem allowed for significantly better 24-hr heart rate control, this effect was offset by a significantly higher incidence of hypotension requiring discontinuation of the drug. Amiodarone may be an alternative in patients with severe hemodynamic compromise.

### Association of atrial fibrillation risk alleles and response to acute rate control therapy [^1179nDHv]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

Given the sparse evidence for selection of first-line therapy for acute atrial fibrillation (AF) based on clinical factors alone, incorporation of genotype data may improve the effectiveness of treatment algorithms and advance the understanding of interpatient heterogeneity. We tested whether candidate nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) related to AF physiologic responses are associated with ventricular rate control after intravenous diltiazem in the emergency department (ED).

Methods

We conducted an analysis within a prospective observational cohort of ED patients with acute symptomatic AF, ventricular rate > 110 beats per minute within the first 2 hours, initially treated with intravenous diltiazem, and who had DNA available for analysis. We evaluated 24 candidate SNPs that were grouped into 3 categories based on their phenotype response (atrioventricular nodal [AVN] conduction, resting heart rate, disease susceptibility) and calculated 3 genetic scores for each patient. Our primary outcome was maximum heart rate reduction within 4 hours of diltiazem administration. Multivariable regression was used to identify associations with the outcome while adjusting for age, sex, baseline heart rate, and diltiazem dose.

Results

Of the 142 patients, 127 had complete data for the primary outcome. None of the genetic scores for AVN conduction, resting heart rate, or AF susceptibility showed a significant association with maximal heart rate response.

Conclusion

Using a candidate SNP approach, screening for genetic variants associated with AVN conduction, resting heart rate, or AF susceptibility failed to provide significant data for predicting successful rate control response to intravenous diltiazem for treating acute AF in the ED.

Atrial fibrillation long-term rate control — recommendations emphasize first-line agents and safety limits. In patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), beta blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (diltiazem, verapamil) are recommended for long-term rate control, and for patients in whom measuring serum digoxin levels is indicated, it is reasonable to target levels < 1.2 ng/mL. In AF with heart failure (HF) symptoms, digoxin is reasonable for long-term rate control in combination with other rate-controlling agents, or as monotherapy if other agents are not preferred, not tolerated, or contraindicated. In AF with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 40%, nondihydropyridine calcium channel–blocking drugs should not be administered given their potential to exacerbate HF, and in patients with permanent AF who have risk factors for cardiovascular events, dronedarone should not be used for long-term rate control.

### 2023 ACC / AHA / ACCP / HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^1176FeNJ]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation long-term rate control — synopsis highlights effective classes and selection considerations. Both nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (verapamil and diltiazem) and beta blockers are effective for long-term rate control, and these agents are useful in ventricular rate control in the absence of preexcitation. Digoxin may be useful in patients with limited tolerability to other agents, or as adjunct therapy in patients with a difficult to control ventricular rate. Limited data exist comparing various rate control agents, especially in the setting of chronic rate control, and selection of specific agents should consider patient-specific characteristics (ie, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction [HFrEF], reactive airway disease) and response.

Regarding medical management for atrial fibrillation, more specifically with respect to rate control, acute control, choice of agents, ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend to consider administering IV magnesium in addition to standard rate control measures to achieve and maintain rate control in patients with AF with rapid ventricular response.

### Achieving ventricular rate control in patients taking chronic β-blocker therapy [^113qz7fv]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Study Objective

The objective of this study is to evaluate the difference in response to ventricular rate control with intravenous (IV) metoprolol compared to IV diltiazem in patients taking chronic beta-blocker therapy who present to the emergency department (ED) in atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular rate (RVR).

Methods

This was a single-center, retrospective study of adult patients taking chronic oral metoprolol. Chronic metoprolol therapy was defined as patients prescribed and taking oral metoprolol within 5days of study inclusion. Rate control was defined as either a decrease in ventricular rate < 100bpm or < 120bpm if the decrease was at least 20% from the presenting heart rate.

Results

A total of 332 patients were included, with 16 patients in the IV diltiazem group and 316 patients in the IV metoprolol group. In the diltiazem arm, 68.8% of patients achieved successful rate control compared to 42.4% of patients in the metoprolol group (p = 0.067). Treatment with IV metoprolol resulted in more hospital admissions (58% vs. 6.25% with diltiazem, p < 0.001). Treatment with diltiazem was associated with a greater incidence of bradycardia compared to IV metoprolol (13% vs. 0%, p = 0.002).

Conclusions

The use of IV diltiazem was associated with a higher rate of successful response to rate control compared to IV metoprolol in patients in AF with RVR on chronic beta-blocker therapy, however the difference between groups was not statistically significant.

CONTRAINDICATIONS

Injectable forms of diltiazem are contraindicated in:

Patients with sick sinus syndrome except in the presence of a functioning ventricular pacemaker.

Patients with second- or third-degree AV block except in the presence of a functioning ventricular pacemaker.

Patients with severe hypotension or cardiogenic shock.

Patients who have demonstrated hypersensitivity to the drug.

Intravenous diltiazem and intravenous beta-blockers should not be administered together or in close proximity (within a few hours).

Patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter associated with an accessory bypass tract such as in WPW syndrome or short PR syndrome.

As with other agents which slow AV nodal conduction and do not prolong the refractoriness of the accessory pathway (e.g., verapamil, digoxin), in rare instances patients in atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter associated with an accessory bypass tract may experience a potentially life-threatening increase in heart rate accompanied by hypotension when treated with injectable forms of diltiazem. As such, the initial use of injectable forms of diltiazem should be, if possible, in a setting where monitoring and resuscitation capabilities, including DC cardioversion/defibrillation, are present (see OVERDOSAGE). Once familiarity of the patient's response is established, use in an office setting may be acceptable.

Patients with ventricular tachycardia. Administration of other calcium channel blockers to patients with wide complex tachycardia (QRS ≥ 0.12 seconds) has resulted in hemodynamic deterioration and ventricular fibrillation. It is important that an accurate pretreatment diagnosis distinguish wide complex QRS tachycardia of supraventricular origin from that of ventricular origin prior to administration of injectable forms of diltiazem.

Atrial fibrillation rate control — comparative drug effects and emergency department outcomes show heart rate reductions across agents and similar acute care outcomes between classes. In a prospective, randomized, investigator-blinded, crossover study, the 24-hour mean heart rate was 96 ± 12 bpm at baseline (no treatment), 75 ± 10 bpm with diltiazem, 81 ± 11 bpm with verapamil, 82 ± 11 bpm with metoprolol, and 84 ± 11 bpm with carvedilol, with all drugs significantly reducing heart rate versus baseline. In a retrospective cohort from two urban emergency departments, a total of 259 consecutive patients were enrolled, with 100 receiving calcium channel blockers and 159 receiving beta blockers; twenty-seven percent of patients taking beta blockers were admitted, while 31.0% of patients taking calcium channel blockers were admitted, with no significant differences in emergency department length of stay, adverse events, or 7- or 30-day revisits. A follow-up analysis of the AFFIRM study reported no difference in all hospitalization and all-cause mortality among participants receiving beta blockers, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, or digoxin as a single rate-control agent at baseline.

General thoracic surgery (GTS) postoperative atrial fibrillation — calcium-channel blocker prophylaxis (diltiazem): Class IIa recommendation: Diltiazem prophylaxis is reasonable in most patients undergoing major pulmonary resection who are not taking a β-blocker preoperatively, though hypotension may develop and dose reduction or other pressure-elevating therapies may be required (Level of evidence B). Several randomized trials show the incidence of atrial fibrillation is reduced by approximately one half: 10.6% versus 21.5% (relative risk 0.50; 95% confidence interval: 0.34 to 0.73), and because diltiazem has a far lower rate of hypotension than verapamil, diltiazem is the recommended calcium-blocking agent. Although the only placebo-controlled diltiazem study used an IV load and 24-hour infusion followed by oral therapy, it may be reasonable to administer prophylactic diltiazem orally alone; oral diltiazem begun in the recovery room is reasonable after lung resection at 30 to 60 mg every 6 hours, and orders should include "hold parameters". These data come from a meta-analysis that included 11 studies, with trials collectively including more than 1,300 participants.

### Metoprolol vs. diltiazem in the acute management of atrial fibrillation in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction [^117JARSL]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to examine the effects of metoprolol versus diltiazem in the acute management of atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular response (RVR) in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).

Methods

This retrospective cohort study of patients with HFrEF in AF with RVR receiving either intravenous push (IVP) doses of metoprolol or diltiazem was conducted between January 2012 and September 2016. The primary outcome was successful rate control within 30 min of medication administration, defined as a heart rate (HR) < 100 beats per minute or a HR reduction ≥ 20%. Secondary outcomes included rate control at 60 min, maximum median change in HR, and incidence of hypotension, bradycardia, or conversion to normal sinus rhythm within 30 min. Signs of worsening heart failure were also evaluated.

Results

Of the 48 patients included, 14 received metoprolol and 34 received diltiazem. The primary outcome, successful rate control within 30 min, occurred in 62% of the metoprolol group and 50% of the diltiazem group (p = 0.49). There was no difference in HR control at predefined time points or incidence of hypotension, bradycardia, or conversion. Although baseline HR varied between groups, maximum median change in HR did not differ. Signs of worsening heart failure were similar between groups.

Conclusions

For the acute management of AF with RVR in patients with HFrEF, IVP diltiazem achieved similar rate control with no increase in adverse events when compared to IVP metoprolol.

### Intravenous metoprolol versus diltiazem for rate control in atrial fibrillation [^113ruAyP]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Currently, it remains unclear whether β-blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are preferred for the acute management of atrial fibrillation (AF).

Objective

The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of intravenous (IV) metoprolol and diltiazem for rate control.

Methods

This was a single-center, retrospective cohort study of patients who presented to the emergency department between 2015 and 2019 with AF with rapid ventricular rate (RVR) and received IV metoprolol or diltiazem. The primary outcome was the percentage of patients who achieved rate control (defined as heart rate < 100 beats per minute). Secondary outcomes included time to rate control, percentage of patients requiring additional agents for rate control, and incidence of cardioversion, bradycardia, and hypotension.

Results

A total of 200 patients were included in this study. Rate control was achieved in 35% and 41% of the metoprolol and diltiazem groups, respectively (P = 0.38). Mean time to rate control was not significantly different between the metoprolol and diltiazem groups (35 vs 21 minutes, P = 0.23). One patient developed hypotension, no patient developed bradycardia, and 4 patients required electric cardioversion. No adverse events were observed in patients with ejection fraction ≤ 40%.

Conclusion and Relevance

There was no difference in the achievement of rate control between IV metoprolol and diltiazem. This is the largest study to date comparing the two classes of agents for acute rate control in AF. No patient-specific factors were identified that would influence the preferential use of one medication over the other.

### What is the best agent for rate control of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response? [^11737sxq]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common dysrhythmia associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Although many patients have stable AF, some patients can present with a rapid ventricular response (RVR). In these patients, it is important to lower their heart rate. However, there are several options available for rate control in the emergency department setting.

Clinical Question

What is the most effective agent for rate control for the patient with AF in RVR?

Evidence Review

Studies retrieved included two prospective, randomized, double-blind studies and six retrospective cohort studies. These studies provide estimates of the efficacy and safety of calcium channel blockers and β-blockers for rate control in those with AF with RVR.

Conclusion

Based upon the available literature, diltiazem likely achieves rate control faster than metoprolol, though both agents seem safe and effective. Clinicians must consider the individual patient, clinical situation, and comorbidities when selecting a medication for rate control.
