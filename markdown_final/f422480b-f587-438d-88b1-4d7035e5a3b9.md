## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about a patient with markedly abnormal liver chemistries, a very high CEA, H. pylori positivity, and severe hyperglycemia, to determine the most likely diagnosis and immediate next steps. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the liver test pattern and severity to classify the injury. Then, I should verify the implications of the markedly elevated CEA in the context of cholestasis. Next, I will consider the differential diagnosis for obstructive jaundice and prioritize malignancy risk. After that, I need to outline the immediate diagnostic workup, including imaging and tumor markers. Finally, I should address H. pylori and diabetes management in parallel while ensuring urgent hepatobiliary evaluation proceeds without delay [^notfound].

> Let me first confirm the liver test pattern and its severity. The AST and ALT are in the several-hundred range, but the alkaline phosphatase is markedly elevated at 866, and the total bilirubin is 15.5 mg/dL, which together indicate a cholestatic process with mixed hepatocellular injury and severe hyperbilirubinemia; I should double-check that this fits a cholestatic or mixed pattern rather than purely hepatocellular, and yes, the disproportionate ALP and high bilirubin support cholestasis with secondary hepatocellular injury, not isolated hepatocellular disease [^1155asMt] [^116MrpTo].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiology yet. I need to check whether this degree of cholestasis and bilirubin elevation is more consistent with extrahepatic obstruction versus intrahepatic cholestasis; given bilirubin around 15 mg/dL with marked ALP elevation, extrahepatic biliary obstruction becomes highly likely, and I should confirm this with imaging before pursuing serologies or biopsy, because management hinges on identifying and relieving obstruction if present [^112SbFyr].

> Next, I should review the CEA of 54.9 ng/mL. Wait, let me verify the implications: CEA is not specific, but in the setting of obstructive jaundice, a markedly elevated CEA raises concern for malignant biliary obstruction, particularly from pancreatic head or cholangiocarcinoma, even though CEA alone is not diagnostic; I should also remember that CA 19–9 can be falsely low in Lewis antigen–negative individuals, so obtaining CEA and CA-125 in that scenario is reasonable, but here the CEA is already high and should heighten suspicion for malignancy rather than attributing it solely to cholestasis [^114zFbS4] [^114apKKw].

> I will now examine the differential diagnosis for this pattern. The leading concern is malignant obstruction of the distal bile duct from pancreatic head adenocarcinoma or cholangiocarcinoma, given the classic triad of obstructive jaundice, high ALP, and high bilirubin; choledocholithiasis is possible but less likely to produce bilirubin this high without imaging evidence of stones, and drug-induced liver injury or autoimmune cholangiopathies would typically not cause this degree of cholestatic hyperbilirubinemia without supportive serologies or history; I should confirm that pancreatic head tumors frequently present with obstructive jaundice and abnormal liver enzymes, which they do [^111UTvti] [^1155asMt].

> Let me think about immediate next steps, and I need to ensure I do not delay urgent imaging. Right upper quadrant ultrasound is the appropriate first-line test to assess for biliary dilatation and look for masses or stones; if ducts are dilated, MRCP or contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen/pelvis should follow to define the level and cause of obstruction, with ERCP reserved for tissue diagnosis and potential stenting if malignant obstruction is suspected; I should double-check that this sequence aligns with guideline-based algorithms for cholestatic injury, and it does [^112SbFyr] [^114k6r3r].

> But wait, what if the ultrasound is normal despite this degree of cholestasis? I should confirm hepatic origin of ALP with GGT, and if GGT is elevated and ultrasound is unrevealing, proceed to MRCP to evaluate for subtle strictures or small periampullary lesions; if imaging and cholangiography are non-diagnostic and cholestasis persists, I should consider liver biopsy, but in this case the clinical probability of extrahepatic obstruction is high enough that advanced biliary imaging should precede biopsy [^114k6r3r] [^113iKdyp].

> Next, I should review tumor markers and laboratory adjuncts. I need to check CA 19–9, recognizing that a very high value supports malignant obstruction but is not specific and can be elevated in benign cholestasis; in Lewis antigen–negative patients, CEA and CA-125 can be informative, and here the already elevated CEA supports the concern for malignancy; I should also obtain a complete blood count, INR, and albumin to assess synthetic function and screen for cholangitis or systemic involvement [^114zFbS4] [^114apKKw].

> I should confirm that this presentation warrants urgent hepatology and surgical oncology input. Given bilirubin around 15 mg/dL with cholestatic enzymes and a markedly elevated CEA, I need to ensure expedited referral for biliary decompression if malignant obstruction is confirmed, because relief of obstruction improves liver function, facilitates systemic therapy, and may improve survival; this urgency is consistent with standards for obstructive jaundice due to suspected malignancy [^notfound].

> Now, regarding H. pylori, I need to ensure I do not conflate gastric pathology with this patient's liver presentation. H. pylori is a recognized carcinogen for gastric cancer and is associated with peptic ulcer disease, but it does not explain obstructive jaundice; nonetheless, I should treat and eradicate H. pylori using a guideline-concordant regimen and confirm eradication, while prioritizing the hepatobiliary workup, because eradication reduces gastric cancer risk and is indicated when found, even if it is unrelated to the current jaundice [^111aJCbW] [^1175JxFt].

> Let me consider the severe hyperglycemia with A1C 13.8%. I should confirm that this degree of uncontrolled diabetes warrants immediate diabetes management and that metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease is a consideration in chronic liver disease, but this acute cholestatic jaundice pattern is not typical of isolated MASLD; still, optimizing glycemic control is essential and, per ADA guidance, patients with T2DM at higher fibrosis risk should be referred for liver evaluation, which can be addressed after the urgent obstructive workup is completed [^114S35eD].

> In summary, I should double-check that my prioritized diagnosis and plan are coherent: the most likely diagnosis is malignant obstruction of the distal bile duct, most commonly pancreatic head adenocarcinoma, given severe cholestatic jaundice with markedly elevated ALP and a very high CEA; immediate actions include urgent right upper quadrant ultrasound, followed by contrast-enhanced CT or MRCP if biliary dilatation is present, measurement of CA 19–9, and urgent hepatology/surgical oncology referral for tissue diagnosis and biliary decompression; parallel steps include treating H. pylori and initiating aggressive diabetes management, but the hepatobiliary evaluation must not be delayed [^111UTvti] [^112SbFyr] [^114zFbS4].

---

The most likely diagnosis is **malignant biliary obstruction** (pancreatic or cholangiocarcinoma) given the markedly elevated ALP, GGT, and direct bilirubin with a very high CEA [^111UTvti] [^113EquiN]. The severe transaminase elevation suggests concurrent hepatocellular injury from cholestasis or ischemia [^116AMfR6]. H. pylori is unrelated to this liver picture, and the A1C reflects uncontrolled diabetes, which is a risk factor for malignancy. Immediate **MRCP or contrast-enhanced CT** is essential to confirm obstruction and guide tissue diagnosis and biliary drainage [^115Txxj6].

---

## Differential diagnosis

### Primary considerations

- **Malignant biliary obstruction**: Pancreatic head or cholangiocarcinoma is strongly suggested by the cholestatic pattern and markedly elevated CEA [^111UTvti].

- **Severe cholestasis**: The ALP and GGT elevations with direct hyperbilirubinemia indicate obstruction or intrahepatic cholestasis [^1155asMt].

- **Hepatocellular injury**: The AST/ALT elevations likely reflect secondary hepatocellular injury from cholestasis or ischemia [^116AMfR6].

---

### Secondary considerations

- **Drug-induced liver injury (DILI)**: Less likely given the severity and cholestatic pattern, but medication history should be reviewed [^1156xFwp].

- **Alcoholic hepatitis**: Typically AST/ALT < 400 U/L with AST/ALT ratio > 1.5, which does not fit this profile [^114mwBou].

- **Autoimmune hepatitis**: Usually presents with hepatocellular injury rather than cholestasis [^115AgRSj].

- **Wilson disease**: Unlikely without hemolysis or neurological symptoms [^notfound].

## Clinical significance of laboratory abnormalities

| **Laboratory test** | **Result** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|-|
| Total bilirubin | 15.5 mg/dL | Severe hyperbilirubinemia indicating cholestasis or hepatocellular injury [^1155asMt] |
| Direct bilirubin | Not specified | Likely elevated, suggesting cholestasis or hepatocellular injury [^113iG5vj] |
| Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) | 866 U/L | Markedly elevated, indicating cholestasis or biliary obstruction [^114k6r3r] |
| Gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) | Not specified | Likely elevated, supporting cholestatic process [^116kNH6E] |
| AST | 318 U/L | Moderately elevated, suggesting hepatocellular injury [^111Zqb9T] |
| ALT | 631 U/L | Markedly elevated, indicating hepatocellular injury [^116xdYTr] |
| CEA | 54.9 ng/mL | Markedly elevated, suggesting malignancy (pancreatic, cholangiocarcinoma, or colorectal) [^notfound] |
| H. pylori | Positive | Unrelated to current liver pathology, but important for gastric cancer risk [^111aJCbW] |
| A1C | 13.8% | Severe hyperglycemia, indicating poorly controlled diabetes mellitus [^notfound] |

## Recommended diagnostic evaluation

### Immediate imaging studies

Order **MRCP or contrast-enhanced CT** of the abdomen and pelvis to assess for biliary obstruction, masses, or strictures [^115Txxj6]. Also obtain a **right upper quadrant ultrasound** as an initial screening tool to evaluate biliary dilatation and liver parenchyma [^115xNaAK].

---

### Laboratory tests

- **Fractionated bilirubin**: Confirm direct hyperbilirubinemia [^113iG5vj].

- **Hepatitis serologies**: HAV, HBV, HCV to exclude viral hepatitis [^1155asMt].

- **Autoimmune markers**: ANA, ASMA, AMA to evaluate for autoimmune hepatitis or primary biliary cholangitis [^114k6r3r].

- **Tumor markers**: CA 19–9, AFP to support malignancy diagnosis [^notfound].

- **Complete blood count, INR, albumin**: Assess liver synthetic function and screen for hematologic abnormalities [^111Zqb9T].

---

### Endoscopic evaluation

Perform **ERCP** if imaging confirms obstruction, both for diagnosis and therapeutic biliary drainage [^114k6r3r].

---

## Management plan

- **Urgent hepatology and oncology consultation**: For expedited evaluation and management [^notfound].

- **Biliary drainage**: ERCP with stenting or percutaneous biliary drainage if malignant obstruction is confirmed [^notfound].

- **Tissue diagnosis**: Biopsy or brushings during ERCP or EUS-guided biopsy if feasible [^notfound].

- **Medical management**: Address complications of cholestasis, including pruritus, nutritional deficiencies, and infection prophylaxis [^notfound].

- **Diabetes management**: Aggressive glycemic control to reduce perioperative risk and improve outcomes [^notfound].

- **H. pylori eradication**: Standard triple therapy followed by confirmation of eradication, given gastric cancer risk [^115jkK6F].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis depends on the **underlying etiology**, stage at diagnosis, and response to therapy. Malignant biliary obstruction generally carries a **poor prognosis**, with 5-year survival rates below 20% for pancreatic cancer and cholangiocarcinoma. Early detection, biliary drainage, and definitive therapy (surgery, chemotherapy, radiation) can improve outcomes [^notfound].

---

The most likely diagnosis is **malignant biliary obstruction** (pancreatic or cholangiocarcinoma) given the cholestatic pattern and markedly elevated CEA. Immediate imaging and hepatology/oncology input are critical.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^113LJvTk]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Abnormal liver chemistries — bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, albumin, and prothrombin time interpretation includes that an elevated GGT suggests that the alkaline phosphatase elevation is of hepatic origin, alkaline phosphatase levels increase in children and the elderly, especially females over 50 years of age, and the total serum bilirubin is usually < 1.1 mg/dl with an elevated direct bilirubin indicating hepatocellular dysfunction or cholestasis; fractionation of total bilirubin is most helpful when the ALT, AST, and alkaline phosphatase levels are normal or near normal, and if the total bilirubin is elevated and fractionation shows the majority of the elevation is unconjugated bilirubin, hepatocellular disease is unlikely; albumin is a plasma protein exclusively synthesized by the liver with a circulating half-life of 3 weeks, a reduction in albumin (normal ≥ 3.5 g/dl) usually indicates liver disease of more than 3 weeks duration, and prothrombin time may be prolonged in patients with severe liver disease of < 24 h duration.

### Care of the patient with abnormal liver test results [^1155Yms9]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Liver tests are commonly performed in primary care and may signal the presence of acute or chronic liver disease. Abnormal results are defined by standardized rather than individual laboratory thresholds and must be interpreted in the context of a patient's history and examination. The pattern and severity of liver injury may provide clues about the cause of disease and should guide diagnostic evaluation with serologic testing and liver imaging. A systematic, stepwise approach to the evaluation and management of abnormal liver test results is recommended to optimize high-value care.

### AGA clinical practice update on diagnosis and management of immune checkpoint inhibitor colitis and hepatitis: expert review [^111PM54b]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Checkpoint inhibitor hepatitis — incidence, pathology, and monitoring: Abnormal liver enzymes are less commonly observed with ICI therapy than enterocolitis, with an incidence of < 5% in clinical trials of ICI monotherapy, but the incidence rises with combination treatments, with approximately one-quarter of patients on ipilimumab and nivolumab combination therapy developing hepatitis and hepatitis also more common with chemotherapy or targeted therapy combinations. The majority of ICI hepatitis cases are associated with either a lymphocytic or granulomatous pattern of hepatocellular injury, and plasma cell infiltration commonly observed in autoimmune hepatitis appears to be less common in ICI hepatitis. Routine monitoring of liver blood tests (ie, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, AST, and ALT) is standard of care for patients treated with immunotherapy, generally at the time of ICI initiation and each treatment cycle, and patients should have pre-treatment testing for hepatitis B virus infection with measurement of surface antigen, surface antibody, and core antibody. Hepatitis is often detected incidentally in asymptomatic patients through routine liver testing, but can present with jaundice, fevers, and malaise; many patients are managed by oncology teams according to CTCAE-based management guidelines that use ALT/AST thresholds to direct diagnostic testing and treatment recommendations.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^115wEbB4]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

What constitutes a standard liver blood test panel?

There are remarkably few data to determine what an optimal liver blood test panel should include, although this would be influenced by the clinical setting. The Health Technology Assessment commissioned Birmingham and Lambeth Liver Evaluation Testing Strategies (BALLETS) study reported that ALT and ALP identified the vast majority of adults with necro-inflammatory liver disease. The routine addition of GGT led to a marginal increase in sensitivity but at the cost of a loss of specificity and a higher false-positive rate. But the analysis did not include adults with NAFLD or alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD), which account for 90% of liver mortality, in whom liver blood tests and the follow-on liver aetiology screen are seldom diagnostic. In this setting GGT and AST would aid the sensitivity of detecting such patients. Addition of GGT to a liver blood test panel increases the likelihood of an adult having abnormal liver blood tests from around 15% to 30%and, notably, a raised GGT is associated with increased liver as well as all-cause (including cancer) mortality, with the greatest risk being observed in those with the most significant elevations of GGT. In addition, the routine addition of AST to the initial panel did not improve the detection of specific disease.

Laboratory test results

Laboratory test results performed at least two years before the diagnosis PDAC for cases and censoring for controls were retrieved and considered as normal, abnormal (elevated or decreased) or missing. Only biologically plausible laboratory test results were included, specifically those related to liver function (alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, bilirubin), pancreatic function (lipase, amylase), inflammatory state (complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase), and cachexia (albumin, total cholesterol, glycated haemoglobin A1c).

Statistical analysis

Patient characteristics, comorbidities and blood results were described using frequencies and proportions for categorical variables. We evaluated the association of various health conditions and test results with PDAC using conditional logistic regression. For the multivariable analysis, we employed backward selection with a significance threshold of p < 0.05 to identify the most relevant variables, computing odds ratios (OR) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). All statistical analyses were performed using R 4.3.1 with the 'survival' package.

### Evaluation of abnormal liver tests in the adult asymptomatic patient [^112Rymzo]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Liver blood tests, including bilirubin, aminotransferases, and alkaline phosphatase, are among the most commonly encountered tests in medicine. With roles including the investigation of symptoms, medication monitoring, assessment of chronic disease, and routine assessment, these tests serve many purposes and result in abnormality in up to 40% of patients.

Recent Findings

The toll of liver disease continues to rise and abnormal liver tests offer an opportunity to identify hepatic disease early, when treatment is most effective and before patients suffer the potential downstream consequences of cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and hepatocellular carcinoma. By utilizing diagnostic strategies including detailed history gathering, alcohol use assessment, recognition of metabolic syndrome, and identifying patterns of liver test abnormalities, clinicians can develop a systematic approach to address abnormal liver tests. For these reasons, developing an evidence-based, systematic approach to handling abnormal liver tests is critically important.

Summary

This review seeks to synthesize key elements of the best evidence, presently available guidelines, and expert opinion in drafting a strategy to aid clinicians and patients in the timely and accurate diagnosis of liver disease for the adult asymptomatic patient with abnormal liver tests.

### Alanine aminotransferase: a clinical and regulatory tool for detecting liver injury-past, present, and future [^116xdYTr]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2012). Low credibility.

Assay of the serum activity of the enzyme alanine aminotransferase (ALT) has become the primary screening tool for detecting acute liver injury. But what does an elevated value mean? Not what it is too often mistakenly believed to indicate. It is not a test of liver function. It does not necessarily predict worse effects to come (in a given person). It is not a valid measure of severity of liver injury or dysfunction. It is too unspecific to be reliable in screening for relatively rare effects on the liver. Although these are substantial limitations, ALT is a very useful biomarker if understood and used properly. It is important to consider how and why these erroneous concepts came to have such wide acceptance, and how elevations of ALT activity for evaluating patients and subjects under study might be interpreted better.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^1155asMt]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — abnormal liver chemistries evaluation and interpretation states that serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin are the most common liver chemistries; hepatocellular injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of AST and ALT compared with alkaline phosphatase, whereas cholestatic injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of alkaline phosphatase as compared with AST and ALT. A true healthy normal ALT level ranges from 29 to 33 IU/l for males, 19 to 25 IU/l for females and levels above this should be assessed. Evaluation of hepatocellular injury includes testing for viral hepatitis A, B, and C; assessment for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic liver disease; screening for hereditary hemochromatosis, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson's disease, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency; and a history of prescribed and over-the-counter medicines should be sought. For alkaline phosphatase elevation determined to be of hepatic origin, testing for primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis should be pursued. Total bilirubin elevation can occur from hepatocellular or cholestatic diseases; elevated total serum bilirubin levels should be fractionated to direct and indirect bilirubin fractions, and an elevated serum conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or biliary obstruction in most settings. A liver biopsy may be considered when serologic testing and imaging fails to elucidate a diagnosis, to stage a condition, or when multiple diagnoses are possible.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^115udJMp]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — cholestatic liver test evaluation recommends disease‑specific testing. Patients with alkaline phosphatase elevation with or without bilirubin elevation should undergo testing for primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) with anti‑mitochondrial antibody. Patients with alkaline phosphatase elevation with or without bilirubin elevation should undergo testing for primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) with MR cholangiography or ERCP in conjunction with IgG4. Both are labeled Strong recommendation, very low level of evidence.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^114Kk3U6]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Abnormal liver chemistries — bilirubin and cholestasis evaluation: In contrast to indirect hyperbilirubinemia, conjugated (direct) hyperbilirubinemia generally implies the presence of parenchymal liver damage or biliary obstruction. There are two rare inherited conditions associated with direct hyperbilirubinemia: Dubin–Johnson syndrome and Rotor syndrome. An elevated bilirubin should be evaluated by determining conjugated and unconjugated fractions of bilirubin. If there are signs of acute liver failure, urgent hepatology consultation with referral to a liver transplant center should be undertaken immediately. Those who present with an elevation in alkaline phosphatase with normal AST, ALT, and bilirubin levels should have their alkaline phosphatase elevation confirmed with a GGT level and if elevated a right upper quadrant ultrasound of the liver should be ordered. If the imaging is normal, autoimmune markers should be ordered. A liver biopsy may ultimately be required to obtain a diagnosis. Extrahepatic causes such as hemolysis should also be assessed.

The risk of an abnormal liver test in 813 patients with multiple sclerosis or clinically isolated syndrome enrolled in placebo arms of clinical trials was greater than expected for alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (relative risk [RR] 3.7; 95% CI: 2.3 to 6.0) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (RR 2.2; 95% CI: 1.3 to 3.6), although not alkaline phosphatase (AP) or total bilirubin, at first presentation. Abnormal test results were associated with higher body mass index (ALT only), male gender (ALT only), and a relapsing-remitting (vs secondary-progressive) course (ALT and AST only).

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^117MpALN]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Clinicians are required to assess abnormal liver chemistries on a daily basis. The most common liver chemistries ordered are serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin. These tests should be termed liver chemistries or liver tests. Hepatocellular injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of AST and ALT levels compared with alkaline phosphatase levels. Cholestatic injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of alkaline phosphatase level as compared with AST and ALT levels. The majority of bilirubin circulates as unconjugated bilirubin and an elevated conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or cholestasis. Multiple studies have demonstrated that the presence of an elevated ALT has been associated with increased liver-related mortality. A true healthy normal ALT level ranges from 29 to 33IU/l for males, 19 to 25IU/l for females and levels above this should be assessed. The degree of elevation of ALT and or AST in the clinical setting helps guide the evaluation. The evaluation of hepatocellular injury includes testing for viral hepatitis A, B, and C, assessment for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic liver disease, screening for hereditary hemochromatosis, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson's disease, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. In addition, a history of prescribed and over-the-counter medicines should be sought. For the evaluation of an alkaline phosphatase elevation determined to be of hepatic origin, testing for primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis should be undertaken. Total bilirubin elevation can occur in either cholestatic or hepatocellular diseases. Elevated total serum bilirubin levels should be fractionated to direct and indirect bilirubin fractions and an elevated serum conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or biliary obstruction in most settings. A liver biopsy may be considered when serologic testing and imaging fails to elucidate a diagnosis, to stage a condition, or when multiple diagnoses are possible.

NCCN Invasive Breast Cancer — findings concerning for progression of metastatic disease — findings concerning for progression of disease include worsening symptoms such as pain or dyspnea, evidence of worsening or new disease on physical examination, declining performance status, unexplained weight loss, increasing alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), or bilirubin, hypercalcemia, new radiographic abnormality or increase in the size of pre-existing radiographic abnormality, new areas of abnormality on functional imaging (eg, bone scan, PET/CT), and increasing tumor markers (eg, carcinoembryonic antigen [CEA], CA 15–3, CA 27.29). Rising tumor markers (eg, CEA, CA 15–3, CA 27.29) are concerning for tumor progression, but may also be seen in the setting of responding disease, and an isolated increase in tumor markers should rarely be used to declare progression of disease; changes in bone lesions are often difficult to assess on plain or cross-sectional radiology or on bone scan, and for these reasons, patient symptoms and serum tumor markers may be more helpful in patients with bone-dominant metastatic disease.

### Mildly elevated liver transaminase levels in the asymptomatic patient [^114h9YzH]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Mild elevations in liver chemistry tests such as alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase can reveal serious underlying conditions or have transient and benign etiologies. Potential causes of liver transaminase elevations include viral hepatitis, alcohol use, medication use, steatosis or steatohepatitis, and cirrhosis. The history should be thorough, with special attention given to the use of medications, vitamins, herbs, drugs, and alcohol; family history; and any history of blood-product transfusions. Other common health conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, and thyroid disease, can cause or augment liver transaminase elevations. The recent American Gastroenterological Association guideline regarding the evaluation and management of abnormal liver chemistry tests proposes a practical, algorithmic approach when the history and physical examination do not reveal the cause. In addition to liver chemistries, an initial serologic evaluation includes a prothrombin time; albumin; complete blood count with platelets; hepatitis A, B, and C serologies; and iron studies. Depending on the etiology, management strategies may include cessation of alcohol use, attention to medications, control of diabetes, and modification of lifestyle factors such as obesity. If elevations persist after an appropriate period of observation, further testing may include ultrasonography and other serum studies. In some cases, biopsy may be indicated.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^112RBbyZ]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

What constitutes a liver blood test?

Liver blood tests are readily available biochemical laboratory tests, with the standard panel varying from hospital to hospital. They have historically been referred to as LFTs, yet the predominant abnormality relates not to liver dysfunction, but to elevations of hepatobiliary liver enzymes. For this reason this guideline will refer to liver blood tests and not LFTs as it more accurately captures their usage in clinical practice. Hepatobiliary enzymes, when interpreted in isolation convey information on the level of ongoing injury, whereas bilirubin, albumin and INR convey information on liver function, with platelets conveying information on the level of fibrosis. In this guideline an abnormal liver blood test is defined as being a value outside the standard reference interval, although there is an emerging literature suggesting that the current reference intervals for ALT may be too high.

Bilirubin is predominantly the by-product of the breakdown of the haem component of haemoglobin by the reticuloendothelial system. It exists in two forms, unconjugated and conjugated. Bilirubin is transported to the liver in its insoluble unconjugated form, where it is converted into soluble conjugated bilirubin in order to be excreted. Unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia is usually due to haemolysis or impaired conjugation whereas conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia is typically due to parenchymal liver disease or obstruction of the biliary system.

Most laboratories will routinely report total bilirubin, which comprises unconjugated and conjugated fractions. Elevations of either fraction will therefore lead to a rise in the measured bilirubin concentration. The most common cause of an isolated elevated bilirubin concentration is Gilbert's syndrome, which is an inherited disorder of metabolism and leads to impaired conjugation via reduced activity of the enzyme glucuronyltransferase.

### Ocrelizumab (Ocrevus) [^115t16N1]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.7	Liver Injury

Clinically significant liver injury, without findings of viral hepatitis, has been reported in the postmarketing setting in patients treated with anti-CD20 B-cell depleting therapies approved for the treatment of MS, including OCREVUS. Signs of liver injury, including markedly elevated serum hepatic enzymes with elevated total bilirubin, have occurred from weeks to months after administration.

Patients treated with OCREVUS found to have an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) greater than 3× the upper limit of normal (ULN) with serum total bilirubin greater than 2× ULN are potentially at risk for severe drug-induced liver injury.

Obtain liver function tests prior to initiating treatment with OCREVUS [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)], and monitor for signs and symptoms of any hepatic injury during treatment. Measure serum aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin levels promptly in patients who report symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including new or worsening fatigue, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine, or jaundice. If liver injury is present and an alternative etiology is not identified, discontinue OCREVUS.

Laboratory abnormalities may signal obstruction as "Elevations in routine or diagnostic liver enzyme testing, especially increased levels of bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase, may lead to a diagnosis of cholestasis due to biliary obstruction localized to the head of the pancreas". In contrast, "patients with pancreatic malignancy in the body and tail typically present with more advanced-stage disease and normal liver biochemistry results because of the absence of biliary obstruction", and "Symptoms generally do not occur until advanced disease is present among patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma involving the body or tail". For serum markers, "CA19–9 levels are elevated in the peripheral blood of the majority of patients with pancreatic cancer, but this finding does not achieve the performance required for either early detection or diagnosis, because of the potential for both false positive and false negative results". Nonetheless, "CA 19–9 is the only U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved biomarker recommended for use in the routine management of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma" and "It has been used for prognosis and as a marker of disease burden (ie, recurrence or disease progression)".

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^113iG5vj]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Elevation of total bilirubin level — evaluation and interpretation: Elevated serum total bilirubin levels should be fractionated to direct and indirect bilirubin, and an elevated serum conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or biliary obstruction in most settings. The first step in investigating elevated bilirubin is determining conjugated (direct) vs. unconjugated (indirect) hyperbilirubinemia, and elevated unconjugated or indirect bilirubin is due to over-production, decreased hepatic uptake, or decreased hepatic conjugation. In Gilbert's syndrome, affecting 3–7% of the US population, total bilirubin levels almost never exceed 6 mg/dl and are usually < 3 mg/dl; fasting or significant illness can increase the unconjugated bilirubin by 2- to 3-fold and will decrease with eating or administration of phenobarbital. In hemolysis, hemolysis infrequently causes a bilirubin level > 5 mg/dl unless co-existent renal disease, liver disease, or severe acute hemolysis is present. In asymptomatic, healthy individuals with mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia (< 4 mg/dl), evaluation should exclude medications that cause hyperbilirubinemia, exclude evidence of hemolysis, and confirm normal serum transaminases and alkaline phosphatase levels; if these are found, then a presumptive diagnosis of Gilbert's syndrome can be made and additional evaluation is not routinely necessary.

### Are unexpected positive dipstick urine bilirubin results clinically significant? A retrospective review [^113PVjaR]. Laboratory Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Urine-bilirubin measurement is common in urinalysis dipsticks, which are known to yield a high rate of false positive results. We evaluated the usefulness of this test after multiple physicians in our system reported that they do not act on positive dipstick urine bilirubin findings.

Methods

We queried past records to determine how many samples with positive urine bilirubin results had associated abnormal results for liver function tests (LFTs) within 2 weeks before the positive urine bilirubin result. (LFTs included aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alanine transaminase [ALT], gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase [GGT], and total bilirubin.) We labeled positive results on these test as expected positives. We labeled the positive test results for samples from patients who had not had abnormal LFT results within 2 weeks before the current testing as unexpected positives.

Results

During a 20-month period, we performed 241,929 urine-bilirubin tests. Of these, 831 (0.3%) yielded positive results. Of these positives, 60% were from patients who had abnormal LFT results in the previous 2 weeks. The remaining 40% of positive results were deemed to be unexpected positives. Of these, 80% had had LFTs ordered within 2 weeks after the positive urine bilirubin results. A total of 85% of those LFTs yielded an abnormal result.

Conclusion

In patients with an unexpected positive urine bilirubin test result, 85% had abnormal LFT results after their positive urine bilirubin result. However, these unexpected positives amounted to only 0.13% of all test results. Urine bilirubin does not appear to add significant information toward the diagnosis of most patients.

### Approach to the liver biopsy in the patient with chronic low-level aminotransferase elevations [^116HcWAh]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Pathologists sometimes encounter a liver biopsy from an asymptomatic patient with unexplained low-level parenchymal liver enzyme elevations. These biopsies often have minor histologic changes but are otherwise almost entirely normal. This can lead to the quandary of whether or not the features are clinically meaningful and how one must formulate a diagnosis from the possibly nonspecific findings of a near-normal biopsy. The following discussion focuses on the histologic changes that can be seen in these biopsies and the practical issues involved in making a diagnosis that provides useful information to the clinician. The literature and textbooks addressing the histologic and clinical features of these cases are reviewed with an emphasis on the clinical implications of finding nonspecific histologic alterations in these patients.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^115PkWRv]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries — initial steps should confirm the abnormality and structure history and examination. Before initiation of evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries, one should repeat the lab panel and/or perform a clarifying test (e.g. GGT if serum alkaline phosphatase is elevated) to confirm that the liver chemistry is actually abnormal. The initial history should assess risk factors for liver diseases including viral hepatitis, metabolic liver disease, exposures to toxins, and medications including alcohol and complementary-alternative medicines, associated diseases including inflammatory bowel disease, hematologic diseases, pulmonary disease, and cardiac disease as well as hereditary forms of liver disease. In those who present with jaundice and abdominal pain, obtaining a history of prior hepatobiliary disease including gallstones and inflammatory bowel disease is recommended. The physical examination of a patient with abnormal liver tests is typically normal, but certain findings might help to confirm the presence of chronic liver disease including jaundice, ascites, splenomegaly, palmar erythema, spiders, and hepatic encephalopathy.

### Marked elevation in serum transaminases: an atypical presentation of choledocholithiasis [^1177apKg]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Choledocholithiasis causes elevations in levels of alkaline phosphatase out of proportion to aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Isolated marked elevation in AST and ALT levels over 1,000 IU/L has been reported infrequently in patients with choledocholithiasis.

Methods

The charts of 18 patients who presented between 1971 and 2002 with documented choledocholithiasis and AST or ALT levels greater than 1,000 IU/L were retrospectively reviewed. An extensive work-up for coexisting disease processes to account for the abnormal AST and ALT levels was negative.

Results

Eighteen patients (16 women, 16 Hispanics, age 38 ± 3 yr) presented with symptoms of choledocholithiasis and marked transaminase elevation. Peak levels of AST and ALT were 1,062 ± 129 and 1,119 ± 90, respectively. Following successful management of gallstone disease, AST and ALT levels fell rapidly to 129 ± 22 and 268 ± 61, respectively, within 3–14 days. There was also a concomitant improvement in the levels of bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase.

Conclusions

In the absence of other hepatobiliary or pancreatic disease, choledocholithiasis can result in elevations in AST and/or ALT greater than 1,000 IU/L. These levels fall markedly once the gallstone disease is appropriately managed.

If the evaluation is negative, then "If evaluation negative and alkaline phosphatase > 2x ULN → consider liver biopsy" or "If evaluation negative and alkaline phosphatase 1–2x ULN → consider observation", and "If AMA positive → evaluate for primary biliary cirrhosis/cholangitis", with persistence prompting "If persistent elevation of serum alkaline phosphatase after 6 months observation → consider liver biopsy". Under "Elevated serum transaminases ± elevated bilirubin", perform "History and physical exam Check right upper quadrant ultrasound"; if "If ductal dilatation → ERCP, MRCP" and if "If no ductal dilatation → check AMA, ANA, SMA". Next, "If AMA positive → evaluate for primary biliary cirrhosis/cholangitis", whereas "If AMA negative and alkaline phosphatase > 2x ULN → consider liver biopsy or MRCP" or "If AMA negative and alkaline phosphatase 1–2x ULN → consider observation", and persistent elevation leads to "If persistent elevation of serum alkaline phosphatase after 6 months observation → consider liver biopsy or MRCP".

ACG Clinical Guideline — initial evaluation steps for abnormal liver chemistries emphasize confirming true abnormalities, medication/supplement review, selective biopsy, and GGT use. Before initiating a workup, repeat the laboratory panel and/or perform a clarifying test to confirm the abnormality. Physicians should ask about prescribed/over‑the‑counter drugs, complementary/alternative medicines, and dietary/herbal supplements that may be associated with drug‑induced liver injury (DILI). A liver biopsy is recommended when serologic testing and imaging fails to elucidate a diagnosis, to stage a condition, or when multiple diagnoses are possible. An elevation of alkaline phosphatase should be confirmed with an elevation in gamma‑glutamyl transferase (GGT), and GGT should not be used as a screening test for underlying liver disease without other abnormal chemistries. All are stated as Strong recommendation, very low level of evidence.

In the pooled safety population of patients with CRC who received LUMAKRAS 960 mg in combination with panitumumab [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)], hepatotoxicity occurred in 15% of patients, of which 4.8% were Grade 3. A total of 7% of patients who received LUMAKRAS had increased ALT or increased AST, of which 0.8% were Grade 3. The median time to first onset of increased ALT or increased AST was 10 weeks (range: 2 to 22). Increased ALT or increased AST leading to dose interruption occurred in 2.4% of patients. A total of 3.2% of patients who received LUMAKRAS had hyperbilirubinemia, of which 2.4% were Grade 3. The median time to first onset of hyperbilirubinemia was 12 weeks (range: 0, 29). Hyperbilirubinemia leading to dose interruption occurred in 1.6% of patients. Among patients with hepatotoxicity, 21% received corticosteroids.

Monitor liver function tests (ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin) prior to the start of LUMAKRAS, every 3 weeks for the first 3 months of treatment, then once a month or as clinically indicated, with more frequent testing in patients who develop transaminase and/or bilirubin elevations. Withhold, reduce the dose or permanently discontinue LUMAKRAS based on severity of the adverse reaction [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^115xNaAK]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Cholestatic liver diseases — evaluation of elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and the role of gamma‑glutamyl transferase (GGT) is outlined as follows: cholestatic liver diseases are associated with elevated alkaline phosphatase, with or without elevated bilirubin, and once alkaline phosphatase has been confirmed to be of hepatic origin, an ultrasound of the liver should be performed to assess the hepatic parenchyma and bile ducts. Biliary dilatation suggests an extrahepatic cause, whereas a non-dilated biliary system suggests that the cause of elevated alkaline phosphatase is intrahepatic; some disease of extrahepatic cholestasis may not be apparent by ultrasound and cholangiography by MR/MRCP or endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography should be undertaken when these disorders are suspected. With isolated alkaline phosphatase elevation, confirmation with GGT, or fractionation of alkaline phosphatase isoenzymes can be used to help differentiate alkaline phosphatase from non-liver sources; however, GGT elevation is not specific for cholestatic liver disease and can be elevated in > 50% of alcoholic patients without obvious evidence of liver disease, so GGT should not be used as a screening test for underlying liver disease in the absence of abnormal liver chemistries. In hospitalized patients with isolated alkaline phosphatase elevations, one study reported that ~80% could be given a clinical diagnosis solely based on history and physical examination, routine labs, and chest X-ray.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines for diagnosis and management of autoimmune hepatitis [^115AgRSj]. Gut (2025). Medium credibility.

Biochemistry

Serum alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) at presentation (while sometimes modestly raised, and occasionally normal) are typically about 10 times higher than normal (sometimes even higher). Serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) can be mildly raised in active disease, but marked elevation suggests primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) or primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) variant syndromes (Section N).

AIH presentation might vary between races. African-American patients are (compared with Caucasian patients) younger, with a higher prevalence of cirrhosis and liver failure. Non-Caucasian patients had more cholestatic histological features and a higher rate of non-response to treatment, not fully explained by differences in access to medical care.

Severity assessment

Although no unified severity classification exists for AIH, there are seven distinct patterns. These incorporate current understanding of acute and chronic liver disease and are determined by the severity of the acute (mild, icteric, severe, fulminant) and chronic (mild, fibrosis, and cirrhosis, compensated and decompensated) components of liver injury:

Asymptomatic disease: (a) mild or (b) with fibrosis/cirrhosis

Asymptomatic patients might not have mild disease. While they tend to have lower serum transaminases than symptomatic patients, severity of necro-inflammation and fibrosis are similar, as is death/transplantation rate. Treating asymptomatic patients is associated with improved survival (Section F).

Chronic hepatitis

This is the most common form of AIH, with insidious onset and non-specific symptoms.

Cirrhosis: (a) compensated and (b) decompensated

About one-third of patients with AIH have cirrhosis at diagnosis. Sometimes patients (usually elderly) present with cirrhosis complications. Cirrhosis and decompensation are poor prognostic features.

Acute hepatitis with or without jaundice

Initial severity of inflammation has prognostic implications. Patients with initial serum AST > 10 x ULN are less likely than those with values < 10 x ULN) to present with cirrhosis and/or decompensation, and to die due to (or need transplantation for) liver disease.

Acute on chronic liver failure (ACLF)

ACLF is acute injury developing in patients with (often unrecognised) cirrhosis, and sometimes with extrahepatic organ failure. In patients with AIH, a disease 'flare' might precipitate ACLF. Such patients might benefit from corticosteroids and most treated patients recover (Section F). However, in the UK, a label of ACLF is a potential mechanism to expedite liver transplant.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® abnormal liver function tests [^112SbFyr]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Liver function tests are commonly obtained in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Various overlapping lab patterns can be seen due to derangement of hepatocytes and bile ducts function. Imaging tests are pursued to identify underlying etiology and guide management based on the lab results. Liver function tests may reveal mild, moderate, or severe hepatocellular predominance and can be seen in alcoholic and nonalcoholic liver disease, acute hepatitis, and acute liver injury due to other causes. Cholestatic pattern with elevated alkaline phosphatase with or without elevated γ-glutamyl transpeptidase can be seen with various causes of obstructive biliopathy. Acute or subacute cholestasis with conjugated or unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia can be seen due to prehepatic, intrahepatic, or posthepatic causes. We discuss the initial and complementary imaging modalities to be used in clinical scenarios presenting with abnormal liver function tests. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^115LahNR]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Importance of context

Interpretation of abnormal liver blood tests requires an understanding of the context in which they arise. This can be illustrated in the extreme by a patient receiving statin therapy who has an ALT of 80 U/L, who is well and requires continued treatment with the statin compared with a patient with end-stage alcohol-related liver disease with an ALT in the normal reference interval at 30 U/L and who may have a life expectancy of weeks. A common assumption is that the detected abnormality represents the first presentation of abnormal LFTs, when it should be standard practice to review previous blood test records and past/current medical history before requesting additional investigations and referrals.

Another setting in which liver bloods are commonly abnormal but not necessarily of clinical concern is pregnancy where the alkaline phosphatase and serum albumin are often elevated and reduced, respectively. Other changes in liver bloods in this setting may indicate worsening of pre-existing disease or the development of pregnancy-related disease, which would warrant prompt investigation.

Recommendation 2: Abnormal liver blood test results should only be interpreted after review of the previous results, past medical history and current medical condition. (level 5, grade D)

### Evaluation of jaundice in adults [^113EquiN]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Jaundice in adults can be an indicator of significant underlying disease. It is caused by elevated serum bilirubin levels in the unconjugated or conjugated form. The evaluation of jaundice relies on the history and physical examination. The initial laboratory evaluation should include fractionated bilirubin, a complete blood count, alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, ?-glutamyltransferase, prothrombin time and/or international normalized ratio, albumin, and protein. Imaging with ultrasonography or computed tomography can differentiate between extrahepatic obstructive and intrahepatic parenchymal disorders. Ultrasonography is the least invasive and least expensive imaging method. A more extensive evaluation may include additional cancer screening, biliary imaging, autoimmune antibody assays, and liver biopsy. Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia occurs with increased bilirubin production caused by red blood cell destruction, such as hemolytic disorders, and disorders of impaired bilirubin conjugation, such as Gilbert syndrome. Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia occurs in disorders of hepatocellular damage, such as viral and alcoholic hepatitis, and cholestatic disorders, such as choledocholithiasis and neoplastic obstruction of the biliary tree.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^117VSnab]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Extent of abnormality

It is assumed that the magnitude of derangement of a liver blood test panel correlates with prognosis, and for this reason threshold values above the upper limit of the reference interval are commonly used when directing the need for further investigation. However, this assumption is not supported by the literature, and prognosis is more clearly determined by diagnosis and context within which the tests are requested. To illustrate this consider two patients; a patient with an acute hepatitis A infection can have ALT values > 1000 U/L, whereas a patient with hepatitis C can have an ALT within the normal reference interval, yet 10 years later the patient with hepatitis A is likely to be alive and well irrespective of how they are managed, whereas the patient with hepatitis C if not investigated and diagnosed is at substantial risk of progressing to end-stage liver disease. Indeed, the the most common causes of abnormal liver blood tests leading to chronic liver disease — namely non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, alcohol-related liver disease and hepatitis C, are frequently associated with only mild or moderate liver blood test abnormalities. Therefore, despite the increasing use of liver blood tests, patients continue to present with undiagnosed end-stage liver disease, which might have been preventable by earlier diagnosis.

Moreover, the current upper limit of normal for many of the liver enzymes (for example ALT) may be too high, which is probably a consequence of patients with occult NAFLD being included in the generation of normal serum ALT ranges. This is perhaps best appreciated in patients with chronic hepatitis B, where treatment guidelines recommend an ALT of > 30 U/L as being significant in males and > 19 U/L significant for females. Further, indirect evidence for this comes from the recognition that in some patients with autoimmune hepatitis their fibrosis stage progresses despite apparent control of their inflammatory process via perceived normal aminotransferase levels. This is compounded by the knowledge that many patients with significant liver fibrosis may have liver enzymes in the normal reference range and normal synthetic function, increasing the difficulty of their early identification. Thus, the clinical assessment of such individuals is critical in determining what the question is (do they have fibrosis?), which tests should be ordered and how should they be interpreted.

Recommendation 3: The extent of liver blood test abnormality is not necessarily a guide to clinical significance. This is determined by the specific analyte which is abnormal (outside the reference range) and the clinical context. (level 5, grade D)

### A multidisciplinary approach to the diagnosis and management of Wilson disease: 2022 practice guidance on Wilson disease from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^114i1ouT]. Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Biochemical liver tests — patterns in Wilson disease include that serum aminotransferase activities are generally abnormal except at a very early age (infancy), and the elevation may be relatively mild and disproportionate to the severity of liver disease. In patients with cirrhosis, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) is often elevated at levels above alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Transient hyperbilirubinemia, mainly unconjugated, may occur with brief self-limited episodes of hemolysis. Low-normal or subnormal serum alkaline phosphatase is typical of Wilson disease associated with intravascular hemolysis; it is also found with severe disease not meeting criteria for ALF (acute liver injury [ALI] without hepatic encephalopathy) and may be associated with episodic hemolysis.

### AGA institute rapid review of the gastrointestinal and liver manifestations of COVID-19, meta-analysis of international data, and recommendations for the consultative management of patients with COVID-19 [^116nnGkp]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

AGA Institute COVID-19 gastrointestinal and liver manifestations — Cholankeril, 2020 (Stanford University Hospitals): In n = 116, survival was 0.9% died, 86.2% discharged, and 4.3% still hospitalized; age was M 50 y (IQR, 35–67), 46.6% females, and disease severity was 71.6% evaluated in ED/clinic only, 20.7% admitted to the medical floor, and 7.8% admitted to ICU. Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms present on admission included diarrhea 10.3% (12), nausea and/or vomiting 10.3% (12), and abdominal pain 8.8% (10); 31.9% reported GI symptoms, median duration 1 day (IQR, 0–4), and none had isolated GI symptoms or GI as the initial symptoms. Liver tests showed aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (n = 65) M 35 (IQR, 22–58) and, in those with any abnormal LFT, M 64 (IQR, 24–76); alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (n = 65) M 32 (IQR, 22–48) and, with abnormal LFT, M 59 (IQR, 22–76); total bilirubin (n = 65) M 0.4 (IQR, 0.3–0.7) and, with abnormal LFT, M 0.5 (IQR, 0.3–0.7). Additionally, 26 patients developed liver enzyme elevation, 22 of whom had normal baseline liver enzymes.

### Gastrointestinal predictors of severe COVID-19: systematic review and meta-analysis [^115L4QyM]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

COVID-19 pandemic has created a need to identify potential predictors of severe disease. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of gastrointestinal predictors of severe COVID-19.

Methods

An extensive literature search was performed using PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and Cochrane. Odds ratio (OR) and mean difference (MD) were calculated for proportional and continuous outcomes using a random-effect model. For each outcome, a 95% confidence interval (CI) and P-value were generated.

Results

A total of 83 studies (26912 patients, mean age 43.5 ± 16.4 years, 48.2% female) were included. Gastrointestinal predictors of severe COVID-19 included the presence of diarrhea (OR 1.50, 95%CI 1.10–2.03; P = 0.01), elevated serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (OR 4.00, 95%CI 3.02–5.28; P < 0.001), and elevated serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (OR 2.54, 95%CI 1.91–3.37; P < 0.001). Significantly higher levels of mean AST (MD 14.78 U/L, 95%CI 11.70–17.86 U/L; P < 0.001), ALT (MD 11.87 U/L, 95%CI 9.23–14.52 U/L; P < 0.001), and total bilirubin (MD 2.08 mmol/L, 95%CI 1.36–2.80 mmol/L; P < 0.001) were observed in the severe COVID-19 group compared to non-severe COVID-19 group.

Conclusion

Gastrointestinal symptoms and biomarkers should be assessed early to recognize severe COVID-19.

### Evaluation of jaundice in adults [^115Txxj6]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Jaundice is an indication of hyperbilirubinemia and is caused by derangements in bilirubin metabolism. It is typically apparent when serum bilirubin levels exceed 3 mg/dL and can indicate serious underlying disease of the liver or biliary tract. A comprehensive medical history, review of systems, and physical examination are essential for differentiating potential causes such as alcoholic liver disease, biliary strictures, choledocholithiasis, drug-induced liver injury, hemolysis, or hepatitis. Initial laboratory evaluation should include assays for bilirubin (total and fractionated), a complete blood cell count, aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, gamma-glutamyltransferase, alkaline phosphatase, albumin, prothrombin time, and international normalized ratio. Measuring fractionated bilirubin allows for determination of whether the hyperbilirubinemia is conjugated or unconjugated. Ultrasonography of the abdomen, computed tomography with intravenous contrast media, and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography are first-line options for patients presenting with jaundice, depending on the suspected underlying etiology. If the etiology of jaundice is unclear despite laboratory testing and imaging, liver biopsy may be required to establish the diagnosis, prognosis, and management of the disease.

### AGA clinical practice update on the management of refractory Helicobacter pylori infection: expert review [^116JMZ31]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for Helicobacter pylori infection, more specifically with respect to management of treatment failure, choice of regimen, AGA 2021 guidelines recommend to recognize that inadequate acid suppression is associated with H. pylori eradication failure. Consider administering high-dose and more potent PPIs, PPIs not metabolized by CYP2C19, or potassium-competitive acid blockers, if available, in patients with refractory H. pylori infection.
