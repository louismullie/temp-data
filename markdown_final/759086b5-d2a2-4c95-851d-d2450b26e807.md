## Question

what are the types of Hepatitis B vaccines?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the types of hepatitis B vaccines are, including historical generations, antigenic composition, novel adjuvants, formulations, therapeutic versus prophylactic use, and dosing schedules. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the historical evolution from plasma-derived to recombinant vaccines. Then, I should verify how recombinant products differ by antigenic content, including tri-antigenic formulations. Next, I need to check which vaccines use novel adjuvants and their schedules. After that, I will review monovalent versus combination formulations and correct any misclassification. Then, I should distinguish prophylactic from experimental therapeutic vaccines. Finally, I must confirm dosing strategies, special populations, nonresponder approaches, and programmatic elements like the birth dose and global recommendations, ensuring each assertion has appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the historical categories. The first-generation hepatitis B vaccines were plasma-derived, using 22-nm HBsAg particles purified from donor plasma and inactivated by chemical and heat treatments, with Heptavax-B and Hevac B as exemplars; these were fully supplanted by second-generation recombinant HBsAg vaccines beginning in 1986, which became the global standard for routine immunization programs [^1133Q1de] [^113pzA8v]. I should double-check durability signals from the plasma-era cohorts as context; long-term follow-up of Alaskan recipients of plasma-derived vaccine demonstrated persistence of protection and anamnestic responses decades later, supporting the foundational efficacy of the earliest platforms [^111PkbPX].

> Now, I need to distinguish within recombinant vaccines by antigenic composition. Wait, let me verify the mono-antigenic versus tri-antigenic constructs. The conventional yeast-derived products are mono-antigenic, containing only the S protein as HBsAg, whereas mammalian-cell–derived tri-antigenic vaccines include pre-S1 and pre-S2 in addition to S, with glycosylation patterns that may enhance immunogenicity, particularly in harder-to-immunize populations [^117CLAkP]. Let me confirm comparative performance; in the PROTECT phase 3 trial, the tri-antigenic vaccine Sci-B-Vac/PreHevbrio achieved noninferior overall and superior seroprotection in adults ≥ 45 years versus Engerix-B, indicating a clinically meaningful immunogenicity advantage in older adults, although cost and programmatic considerations limit universal use [^116kAnr6] [^117CLAkP].

> Next, I should review vaccines with novel adjuvants. Heplisav-B incorporates a CpG 1018 TLR9 agonist and is licensed as a 2-dose series at 0 and 1 month for adults ≥ 18 years; randomized data show higher seroprotection rates compared with Engerix-B, which is operationally valuable for rapid series completion in adults [^116n9Wrn] [^112JGZuo] [^116BfqY1]. Hold on, I need to check special situations; ACIP notes limited data in pregnancy and dialysis for Heplisav-B, recommending traditional recombinant products in pregnancy when vaccination is indicated, so product selection should be tailored to clinical context [^113mcJqz].

> I will now examine formulation classes. Monovalent HepB vaccines are used across ages, while combination formulations simplify schedules. Initially, I thought DTaP-IPV-Hib-HepB was pentavalent; wait, that's incorrect — counting D, T, aP, IPV, Hib, and HepB makes this a hexavalent vaccine used from 6 weeks of age in infants, with guidance on minimum ages and the requirement that the final HepB-containing dose be at ≥ 24 weeks to ensure adequate response [^1163CEdx]. Let me also confirm the HepA-HepB adult combination Twinrix, which is licensed for persons ≥ 18 years and can be useful for co-immunization needs and certain booster strategies in specific settings [^11785rWE] [^114C8nwV].

> I need to ensure I clearly separate prophylactic vaccines from therapeutic candidates. Prophylactic vaccines prevent HBV infection and include plasma-derived historical products, recombinant mono-antigenic, tri-antigenic, and adjuvanted formulations, while therapeutic vaccine platforms aiming to restore HBV-specific T cell responses in chronic infection remain investigational; examples include peptide-based HepTcell and vector or DNA-based approaches, which have shown safety and immunogenicity signals but have not yet translated into consistent clinical cure endpoints [^115W8CeF] [^115BxZHY] [^1155un3A].

> Let me think about dosing and schedules across life stages. Standard infant immunization entails a birth dose followed by 2–3 additional doses per WHO and national schedules, while adults generally receive a 3-dose series at 0, 1, and 6 months with Engerix-B or Recombivax HB, or a 2-dose series at 0 and 1 month with Heplisav-B if age ≥ 18 years; if series are interrupted, they should not be restarted, and minimum intervals must be observed for validity and immunogenicity [^112PcLgv] [^113tL6Wx] [^116BfqY1]. I should confirm labeled pediatric dosing; Recombivax HB pediatric series is 0.5 mL IM at 0, 1, and 6 months, with defined adolescent alternatives, while adult dosing uses the higher volume or antigen content per product labeling [^117DDyYc] [^114putcj].

> Hold on, I should review strategies for suboptimal responders and special populations. Approximately 5–10% of healthy adults do not achieve seroprotection after a standard series, with lower responses in older age, obesity, diabetes, smoking, and immunocompromise; approaches include completing additional doses, using higher antigen doses, employing adjuvanted or tri-antigenic vaccines, or in some settings using double-dose Twinrix for revaccination of nonresponders, which has yielded high seroprotection in small studies [^117CLAkP] [^116DUw4t] [^1132KgjH] [^116kAnr6]. I should double-check that memory persists even when titers wane; anamnestic responses decades after primary series are well documented, supporting durable immune memory despite declining anti-HBs levels over time [^1115fH9V] [^1115fH9V].

> Next, I should verify programmatic priorities, especially the birth dose. The first dose administered within 24 hours of birth is a cornerstone of preventing perinatal transmission and is recommended by WHO and pediatric bodies, with evidence that broad scale-up of timely birth dose to 90% coverage could avert hundreds of thousands of deaths in coming birth cohorts; implementation science shows that nursing-led workflow changes can markedly improve on-time birth dose delivery [^112PcLgv] [^115cMa1s] [^112w5PWo] [^113hQypN]. Let me also confirm adult policy trends; ACIP now recommends universal adult vaccination for ages 19–59 years and risk-based vaccination for older adults, aligning adult prevention with population-level control goals [^113tL6Wx].

> Let me reconsider the taxonomy to ensure completeness. In summary, the main categories are first-generation plasma-derived vaccines, second-generation recombinant mono-antigenic vaccines, tri-antigenic recombinant vaccines, adjuvanted recombinant vaccines such as Heplisav-B, and combination formulations including infant hexavalent DTaP-IPV-Hib-HepB and adult HepA-HepB; therapeutic vaccine candidates remain investigational and are distinct from prophylactic vaccination used in routine programs, and dosing schedules vary by product and age with strong emphasis on a timely birth dose and adherence to validated intervals for series completion [^1133Q1de] [^116kAnr6] [^116n9Wrn] [^1163CEdx] [^11785rWE] [^115W8CeF] [^113tL6Wx] [^112PcLgv].

Hepatitis B vaccines include **recombinant vaccines** (Engerix-B, Recombivax HB) for infants, children, and adults [^113mcJqz] [^117DDyYc]; **adjuvanted vaccines** (Heplisav-B) for adults ≥ 18 years with a 2-dose schedule [^112JGZuo] [^116n9Wrn]; and **combination vaccines** (Twinrix [^11785rWE], Pediarix, Hexaxim [^1163CEdx]) for streamlined immunization [^116eSRrs]. All are **highly effective and safe** [^1112D9aW], with long-term protection [^111PkbPX] and no need for routine boosters in immunocompetent individuals [^1115fH9V].

---

## Recombinant hepatitis B vaccines

Recombinant vaccines are the standard for universal infant and adult immunization [^112UHDGe]; they are produced in yeast [^1133Q1de] and contain **HBsAg** with an **aluminum adjuvant**.

| **Vaccine name** | **Manufacturer** | **Formulation** | **Indication** | **Schedule** |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| Engerix-B | GlaxoSmithKline | Recombinant HBsAg | Infants, children, adults | 0, 1, 6 months |
| Recombivax HB | Merck | Recombinant HBsAg | Infants, children, adults | 0, 1, 6 months |

---

For recombinant hepatitis B vaccines, **immunogenicity** exceeds 95% seroprotection [^117CLAkP] in healthy infants, children, and young adults, with lower responses in older adults and immunocompromised persons. **Safety** is excellent, with no association with SIDS, chronic fatigue syndrome, or MS [^1112D9aW].

---

## Adjuvanted hepatitis B vaccines

Adjuvanted vaccines use novel **adjuvants** [^116n9Wrn] to enhance **immunogenicity**, particularly in adults and other lower-response populations.

| **Vaccine name** | **Manufacturer** | **Adjuvant** | **Indication** | **Schedule** |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| Heplisav-B | Dynavax | CpG 1018 | Adults ≥ 18 years | 0, 1 month |
| Fendrix | GlaxoSmithKline | AS04 (MPL + alum) | ≥ 15 years with renal insufficiency (EU) | 0, 1, 2, 6 months |

---

For adjuvanted hepatitis B vaccines, **immunogenicity** reaches 90–100% seroprotection [^112JGZuo] with a 2-dose series and is superior to standard 3-dose regimens. **Safety** is comparable to standard vaccines, with no significant increase in adverse events [^112JGZuo] [^116n9Wrn].

---

## Combination hepatitis B vaccines

Combination vaccines include hepatitis B with other antigens to **simplify schedules and improve coverage** [^116eSRrs] [^114XQCxn].

| **Vaccine name** | **Components** | **Indication** | **Schedule** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Twinrix | Hepatitis A + B | Adults ≥ 18 years | 0, 1, 6 months |
| Pediarix | DTaP + IPV + HepB | Infants | 2, 4, 6 months |
| Hexaxim | DTaP + IPV + Hib + HepB | Infants | 2, 4, 6 months |

---

In combination hepatitis B vaccines, **immunogenicity** is comparable to monovalent vaccines, with high seroprotection rates [^11785rWE]. **Safety** is similar to monovalent vaccines, with no significant increase in adverse events [^11785rWE] [^116eSRrs].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pregnancy**: Engerix-B and Recombivax HB are preferred; Heplisav-B is not recommended due to limited data [^113mcJqz] [^111vGXpw].
- **Immunocompromised individuals**: Higher doses or additional doses may be needed to achieve seroprotection [^117CLAkP] [^112UHDGe].
- **Nonresponders**: Additional doses or alternative vaccines (e.g. Heplisav-B) can improve response [^116DUw4t] [^116n9Wrn] [^1132KgjH].

---

## Long-term protection and booster doses

The **duration of protection** is at least 20–30 years after the primary series [^116mW2HR], and immune memory persists even if anti-HBs declines [^111PkbPX]. Booster doses are **not routinely needed** in immunocompetent individuals [^111PkbPX] but may be considered in immunocompromised or high-risk populations.

---

Hepatitis B vaccines include recombinant, adjuvanted, and combination formulations, all of which are **highly effective and safe**, providing long-term protection against HBV infection [^112UHDGe] [^1143Rqe4].

### Considerations for hepatitis B as part of a combination vaccine [^116eSRrs]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2001). Low credibility.

In 1991, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) developed a comprehensive strategy to eliminate the transmission of the hepatitis B virus in the United States, which includes immunization of all infants. Today, as the number of recommended childhood vaccinations increases, combination vaccines are needed to simplify the immunization schedule and improve coverage levels.

- **Methods**: A review of the literature was performed to determine the considerations that should be taken when the hepatitis B virus vaccine (HepB) is included as part of a combination vaccine.

- **Results**: A combination vaccine that incorporates HepB and other routine infant vaccine antigens has been developed for administration at 2, 4, and 6 months of age. Clinical studies have demonstrated that administration of HepB, either as a monovalent or combination vaccine at 2, 4, and 6 months of age, induces a seroprotective immune response similar to that achieved with monovalent HepB administered at 0, 1, and 6 months of age. In addition, the combination vaccine results in similar or fewer adverse reactions compared with separate administration of its components. Infants given a dose of monovalent HepB at birth will receive a total of four doses of HepB when the combination is used. The extra dose of HepB has not led to increased adverse reactions.

- **Conclusions**: A HepB-containing combination vaccine administered at 2, 4, and 6 months of age is as safe and immunogenic as separate administration of its components and will help simplify the childhood immunization schedule.

### Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices for use of a hepatitis B vaccine with a novel adjuvant [^112JGZuo]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). High credibility.

Hepatitis B (HepB) vaccination is the primary means of preventing infections and complications caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV). On February 21, 2018, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended Heplisav-B (HepB-CpG), a yeast-derived vaccine prepared with a novel adjuvant, administered as a 2-dose series (0, 1 month) for use in persons aged ≥ 18 years. The ACIP Hepatitis Vaccines Work Group conducted a systematic review of the evidence, including data from four randomized controlled trials assessing the prevention of HBV infection and six randomized controlled trials assessing adverse events in adults. Seroprotective antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs) levels were achieved in 90.0%-100.0% of subjects receiving HepB-CpG (Dynavax Technologies Corporation), compared with 70.5%-90.2% of subjects receiving Engerix-B (GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals). The benefits of protection with 2 doses administered over 1 month make HepB-CpG an important option for the prevention of HBV.

### Universal hepatitis B vaccination in adults aged 19–59 years: updated recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices - United States, 2022 [^113mcJqz]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2022). Low credibility.

The safety and effectiveness of Heplisav-B and PreHevbrio have not been established in adults on hemodialysis. Data are not available to assess the effects of Heplisav-B and PreHevbrio on breastfed infants or on milk production and excretion. Data on Heplisav-B and PreHevbrio are currently insufficient to inform vaccine-associated risks in pregnancy. Thus, providers should vaccinate pregnant women needing HepB vaccination with Engerix-B, Recombivax HB, or Twinrix.

- **Recommended doses and schedules**: The recommended doses and schedules of hepatitis B vaccine are outlined for adults aged ≥ 18 years and persons aged 11–19 years, by vaccine type and age group. If the HepB vaccination schedule is interrupted, the series does not need to be restarted. If a 3-dose series is interrupted after the first dose, the second dose should be administered as soon as possible; the second and third doses should be separated by an interval of ≥ 8 weeks. If only the third dose has been delayed, it should be administered as soon as possible. The final dose of a 3-dose series must be administered ≥ 8 weeks after the second dose and ≥ 16 weeks after the first dose; the minimum interval between the first and second doses is 4 weeks. Inadequate doses of hepatitis B vaccine or doses received following a shorter-than-recommended dosing interval should be readministered using the correct dosage or schedule. Vaccine doses administered ≤ 4 days before the minimum interval or age are considered valid.

### Protection and antibody levels 35 years after primary series with hepatitis B vaccine and response to a booster dose [^111PkbPX]. Hepatology (2022). Low credibility.

- **Participants and methods**: In 1981, a total of 1630 persons were given three doses of the Heptavax plasma-derived HBV vaccine on a 0-, 1-, and 6-month schedule. Persons aged 20 years or older received a 20-µg dose for all three primary doses, while those under 20 years received 10-µg doses. Of these individuals, 1578 remained serologically negative for HBsAg and HBcAg (anti-HBc) throughout the primary series. Participants were recruited for this long-term vaccine demonstration project from 15 study communities in a remote region of Alaska where HBV was endemic at the time.

Persons who received an inadvertent nonstudy HBV booster dose were removed from follow-up at the time of the fourth HBV dose. Beginning at the 22-year follow-up, individuals with an anti-HBs level below 10 mIU/ml were offered an intramuscular 10-µg booster HBV vaccine dose on a subsequent visit (Recombivax HB; Merck, Kenilworth, NJ, USA). Seven communities were visited for the 22-year follow-up, and the remaining eight communities (not visited at the 22-year follow-up) were visited at the 30-year follow-up.

During the 35-year follow-up in the fall of 2016, visits were made to 15 remote communities and three urban areas. Persons who had received an HBV booster dose at the 22- or 30-year follow-up were not actively recruited at the 35-year time point. The study team made three visits to each of the 15 study communities: the first to recruit participants and conduct HBV serology tests; the second to offer a booster dose to persons whose anti-HBs level fell below 10 mIU/ml; and the third, one month after the second, to check the response to the booster dose.

### Licensure of a diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis, inactivated poliovirus, Haemophilus influenzae type b conjugate, and hepatitis B vaccine, and guidance for use in infants [^1163CEdx]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Low credibility.

For the prevention of hepatitis B, children are recommended to receive 3 doses of a HepB vaccine at ages 0, 1–2, and 6–18 months, with variations depending on the maternal hepatitis B infection status, infant birthweight, and vaccine manufacturer. Universal HepB vaccination of all infants beginning at birth provides a critical safeguard and prevents infection among infants born to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)–positive mothers not identified prenatally. DTaP-IPV-Hib-HepB is not licensed for the birth dose but can be used for doses given at age ≥ 6 weeks to infants of HBsAg-negative mothers. In addition to this FDA-approved use, 3 doses of DTaP-IPV-Hib-HepB can be administered to an infant aged ≥ 6 weeks born to a woman who is HBsAg-positive or whose HBsAg status is unknown. For an adequate immune response, the last dose of the HepB vaccine should be given at age ≥ 24 weeks; therefore, the third dose of DTaP-IPV-Hib-HepB is not recommended to be given before age 24 weeks. If it is given earlier, an additional dose of the HepB vaccine should be given at age ≥ 24 weeks, maintaining proper spacing with previous doses.

Data are limited on the safety and immunogenicity of interchanging vaccines from different manufacturers for the vaccination series in a child. Whenever feasible, the same manufacturer's product should be used to complete the primary series; however, vaccination should not be deferred if the specific vaccine product previously administered is unavailable or unknown.

DTaP-IPV-Hib-HepB can be used for children aged < 5 years requiring a catch-up schedule.

### Guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis, care and treatment for people with chronic hepatitis B infection [^117Eq5A8]. Geneva: World Health Organization (2024). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for hepatitis B virus infection, specifically in relation to immunizations, WHO 2024 guidelines recommend ensuring that the delivery of the hepatitis B vaccine within 24 hours of birth is a performance indicator in all immunization programs. Additionally, they advise strengthening reporting and monitoring systems to improve the quality of data on the birth dose.

### Progress in vaccination against hepatitis B in the Americas [^116UpuxF]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2005). Low credibility.

Hepatitis B is a serious public health problem that leads to chronic infection, liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) recommend routine universal infant vaccination against hepatitis B as the main strategy for controlling hepatitis B and its severe consequences. PAHO additionally recommends routinely vaccinating healthcare workers.

As of 2005, all countries in the Americas, except Haiti and Dominica, have included the hepatitis B vaccine in their childhood immunization schedule; 13 countries and territories include a hepatitis B dose given at birth. The hepatitis B vaccine has been incorporated into national schedules using different modalities; notably, 28 countries use a combination vaccine comprising diphtheria tetanus pertussis, Haemophilus influenzae type b, and hepatitis B (DTP+Hib+Hep B) for infants. Coverage levels for the third dose of hepatitis B are usually over 80%; however, overall hepatitis B vaccine coverage is lower than for the third dose of DTP.

Insufficient information is available at this time to assess the use of the hepatitis B vaccine in healthcare workers in the Americas. The most important factor associated with the success of hepatitis B vaccination implementation has been the strong commitment of country governments. This experience can be used as a model for implementing new health technologies as they become available. However, much still needs to be done to improve hepatitis B coverage.

### Hepatitis B vaccines [^115XTRn5]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

Viral hepatitis type B, caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV), is a serious, potentially life-threatening disease that can be prevented by vaccination. Most people who are newly HBV infected remain asymptomatic and do not know their hepatitis status for many years. Only some individuals newly infected with HBV experience symptoms (acute hepatitis) [1, 2]. Symptoms can include extreme fatigue, abdominal pain, nausea, and jaundice. Most available scientific evidence suggests that HBV is not directly cytopathic, but that liver damage is caused by the cellular response to viral proteins in infected hepatocytes [3].

For many people, hepatitis B is a short-term illness as clinical signs and symptoms typically resolve within 1 to 3 months. Fulminant liver failure occurs in approximately 0.5% to 1.0% of adults with acute hepatitis B. In a subset of individuals, HBV can also cause a chronic liver infection that may progress to cirrhosis (scarring of the liver) or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The course of chronic HBV infection is dynamic, with different clinical phases, each potentially lasting for decades [5]. Most of the disease burden associated with HBV infection occurs among individuals with chronic infection.

The age of acquisition of the HBV infection is the primary determinant in the clinical expression of acute disease and the development of chronic infection [9]. Fewer than 10% of children younger than 5 years who become infected exhibit initial clinical signs or symptoms of the disease.

### Benefits of early hepatitis B immunization programs for newborns and infants [^112PSmeN]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Despite the availability of safe and effective hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccines for over 20 years, strategies targeting risk groups have failed to sufficiently control hepatitis B disease at the population level, primarily due to difficulties in risk identification and program implementation. Consequently, the global burden of disease from HBV remains substantial. The World Health Organization recommends universal vaccination against hepatitis B to eliminate HBV ultimately. By the end of 2006, this recommendation had been progressively implemented to reach 168 countries with a universal program.

However, hepatitis B immunization is at risk of losing its place on the agendas of governments, agencies, and international organizations. This shift is mainly due to the increasing success of these immunization programs and the growing interest in newer vaccine-preventable diseases and related programs. This publication aims to demonstrate that vaccination programs targeting newborns and infants are preferable for achieving this goal.

The benefits of universal HBV vaccination for newborns and infants include a higher impact on the chronic carrier rate and transmission, established potential for high vaccine coverage in this age group, opportunities to combine HBV vaccination with existing universal vaccination programs for newborns and infants, and the impact on perinatal transmission if vaccination is started shortly after birth. Moreover, the safety, immunogenicity, and long-term efficacy of newborn and infant HBV vaccination have been extensively proven.

### Approaches, progress, and challenges to hepatitis C vaccine development [^116Wgm5W]. Gastroenterology (2019). Low credibility.

There are significant deficits in our tools for the development of an HCV vaccine. Elucidating the mechanisms through which antigen-specific immune cell populations mediate long-term protection is an important goal. Vaccine strategies meant to overcome the enormous diversity of HCV must generate a broad immune response, capable of responding to abundant variations. Selecting antigens to maximize the induction of T-cell and antibody responses that elicit successful responses remains an active area of research.

At least four types of HCV antigens have been proposed to maximize the induction of robust and cross-protective responses:

- **Specific previously defined T-cell epitopes**: Include these for improved response.
- **A single circulating HCV variant quadrivalent genotype 1a/1b/2a/3a VLP**: A strategic choice for diverse immunity.
- **Antigens generated computationally**: Minimize the degree of sequence dissimilarity between a vaccine strain and contemporary circulating viruses. One study demonstrated the potential of computer-generated sequences to elicit cross-reactive T-cell responses compared to previously defined T-cell epitopes or circulating HCV variants. These data support the use of a synthetically generated sequence as a vaccine antigen to elicit robust CD8+ T-cell responses. However, computational strategies to aid in antigen design have not been used in HCV vaccines.

Methods for introducing antigens are also being explored, with novel vectors in development for use against HCV and other viral targets. Studies in small animal models and macaques have shown that the addition of class-II invariant chain to an immunogen encodes further benefits for immune response.

### Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices for use of a hepatitis B vaccine with a novel adjuvant [^1136MA2s]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

CDC guidance for use includes interchangeability and dosing schedule. Data are limited on the safety and immunogenicity effects when HepB-CpG is interchanged with HepB vaccines from other manufacturers. When feasible, the same manufacturer's vaccines should be used to complete the series. However, vaccination should not be deferred when the manufacturer of the previously administered vaccine is unknown or when the vaccine from the same manufacturer is unavailable.

The 2-dose HepB vaccine series only applies when both doses in the series consist of HepB-CpG. Series consisting of a combination of 1 dose of HepB-CpG and a vaccine from a different manufacturer should consist of 3 total vaccine doses and should adhere to the 3-dose schedule minimum intervals of 4 weeks between dose 1 and 2, 8 weeks between dose 2 and 3, and 16 weeks between dose 1 and 3. Doses administered at less than the minimum interval should be repeated. However, a series containing 2 doses of HepB-CpG administered at least 4 weeks apart is valid, even if the patient received a single earlier dose from another manufacturer.

### Is there still hope for the prophylactic hepatitis C vaccine? A review of different approaches [^111Cie8z]. Journal of Medical Virology (2024). Low credibility.

Despite remarkable progress in the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, it remains a significant global health burden, necessitating the development of an effective prophylactic vaccine. This review paper presents the landscape of HCV vaccine candidates and approaches, including more traditional methods based on inactivated virus, and more modern methods such as subunit protein, vectored, nucleic acids (DNA and mRNA), and virus-like particles.

The concept of the HCV vaccine is first put in the context of viral genetic diversity and adaptive responses to HCV infection, an understanding of which is crucial in guiding the development of an effective vaccine against such a complex virus. Ethical dimensions are also significant in vaccine research, development, and potential deployment, and we address them in this paper. The road to a safe and effective vaccine to prevent HCV infection remains bumpy due to the genetic variation of HCV and its ability to evade immune responses.

Progress in cell-culture systems has allowed for the production of an inactivated HCV vaccine candidate, which can induce cross-neutralizing antibodies in vitro, but whether this could prevent infection in humans is unknown. Subunit protein vaccine candidates that entered clinical trials elicited HCV-specific humoral and cellular responses, though it remains to be shown whether they translate into effective prevention of HCV infection or progression of infection to a chronic state. Such responses were also induced by a clinically tested vector-based vaccine candidate, which decreased rates of infection progression.

### DNA-based immunotherapy: Potential for treatment of chronic viral hepatitis [^1141L7ou]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2002). Low credibility.

Persistent HBV and HCV infections represent major causes of chronic liver disease with a high risk of progression to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Conventional protein-based vaccines are highly efficacious in preventing HBV infection; however, in therapeutic settings with chronically infected patients, results have been disappointing. Prophylactic vaccination against HCV infection has not yet been achieved due to many impediments, including frequent spontaneous mutations of the virus that allow escape from immune system control.

Using animal models, it has been demonstrated that DNA-based immunisation strategies may overcome this problem because of their potential to induce immunity against multiple viral epitopes. DNA-based vaccines mimic the effect of live attenuated viral vaccines, eliciting cell-mediated immunity in addition to inducing humoral responses. Efficacy may be further improved by the addition of DNA encoding immunomodulatory cytokines. More recently, direct genetic modulation of antigen-presenting cells, such as dendritic cells (DC), has been shown to increase antigen-specific immune responses.

This review focuses on the immunological aspects of chronic HBV and HCV infection and on the potential of DNA- and DC-based vaccines for the treatment of chronic viral hepatitis.

### The impact of the timely birth dose vaccine on the global elimination of hepatitis B [^112w5PWo]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

In 2016, the World Health Organization set the goal of eliminating hepatitis B globally by 2030. Horizontal transmission has been greatly reduced in most countries by scaling up coverage of the infant HBV vaccine series, and vertical transmission is therefore becoming increasingly dominant. Here we show that scaling up timely hepatitis B birth dose vaccination to 90% of newborns in 110 low- and middle-income countries by 2030 could prevent 710,000 (580,000 to 890,000) deaths in the 2020 to 2030 birth cohorts compared to the status quo, with the greatest benefits in Africa. Maintaining this could lead to elimination by 2030 in the Americas, but not before 2059 in Africa. Drops in coverage due to disruptions in 2020 may lead to 15,000 additional deaths, mostly in South-East Asia and the Western Pacific. Delays in planned scale-up could lead to an additional 580,000 deaths globally in the 2020 to 2030 birth cohorts.

### A randomized controlled trial to evaluate a potential hepatitis B booster vaccination strategy using combined hepatitis A and B vaccine [^114C8nwV]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Booster doses could play a major role in non-responders or low responders to the primary hepatitis B (HB) vaccine. The planned time point for hepatitis A vaccination in China provides a good opportunity to carry out an HB booster dose by using a combined hepatitis A and B vaccine.

- **Methods**: A randomized, double-blinded clinical trial was conducted to compare the immunogenicity and safety of toddlers 18–24 months of age receiving three different vaccination regimens: two doses of inactivated hepatitis A vaccine (group 1), one dose of inactivated hepatitis A vaccine plus one dose of combined hepatitis A and B vaccine (group 2), or two doses of combined hepatitis A and B vaccine (group 3).

- **Results**: All three groups showed 100% seroprotection for antihepatitis A virus antibody after vaccination. The seroprotection rate for anti-HB antibody before vaccination ranged from 79.5% to 92.9% in the three groups. After the second inoculation, anti-HBs seroprotection increased from 92.9% to 100% in group 2 with a postvaccination geometric mean concentration (GMC) of 2258.3 mIU/mL, and from 79.5% to 98.9% in group 3 with a postvaccination GMC of 2055.3 mIU/mL. The adverse events were not statistically different among groups (P = 0.345).

-Conclusions: The combined hepatitis A and B vaccine could stimulate a high level of both antihepatitis A virus and anti-HBs antibodies without increasing adverse events, providing a new choice for an HB booster.

### Antibody levels and protection after hepatitis B vaccine: Results of a 22-year follow-up study and response to a booster dose [^1115fH9V]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

The duration of protection in children and adults, including health care workers, resulting from the hepatitis B vaccine primary series is unknown.

- **Methods**: To determine the protection afforded by the hepatitis B vaccine, Alaska Native persons who had received plasma-derived hepatitis B vaccine when they were over 6 months of age were tested for antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs) 22 years later. Those with levels ≥ 10 mIU/mL received a booster dose. A booster dose was administered to 164 persons, and 77% responded with an anti-HBs level ≥ 10 mIU/mL at 10–14 days, reaching 81% by 60 days. Response to a booster dose was positively correlated with younger age, peak anti-HBs response after primary vaccination, and the presence of detectable anti-HBs before boosting. Considering persons with an anti-HBs level ≥ 10 mIU/mL at 22 years and those who responded to the booster dose, protection was demonstrated in 87% of the participants. No new acute or chronic hepatitis B virus infections were identified.

- **Conclusions**: The protection afforded by primary immunization with plasma-derived hepatitis B vaccine during childhood and adulthood lasts at least 22 years. Booster doses are not needed.

### Elimination of perinatal hepatitis B: Providing the first vaccine dose within 24 hours of birth [^113hQypN]. Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

After the introduction of the hepatitis B vaccine in the United States in 1982, a reduction of more than 90% in new infections was achieved. However, approximately 1000 new cases of perinatal hepatitis B infection are still identified annually in the United States. Prevention of perinatal hepatitis B relies on the proper and timely identification of infants born to mothers who are hepatitis B surface antigen positive and to mothers with unknown status. This ensures the administration of appropriate postexposure immunoprophylaxis with the hepatitis B vaccine and immune globulin. To further reduce the incidence of perinatal hepatitis B transmission, the American Academy of Pediatrics endorses the recommendation of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that all newborn infants with a birth weight greater than or equal to 2000 g receive the hepatitis B vaccine by 24 hours of age.

### Universal hepatitis B vaccination in adults aged 19–59 years: Updated recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices - United States, 2022 [^113tL6Wx]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2022). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for hepatitis B virus infection, specifically concerning immunizations, the CDC 2022 guidelines recommend offering vaccination against HBV to adults aged 19–59 years and adults aged ≥ 60 years with the following risk factors for hepatitis B:

- **Persons at risk for infection by sexual exposure**: Sex partners of persons testing positive for HBsAg; sexually active persons not in a long-term, mutually monogamous relationship (such as persons with > 1 sex partner during the previous 6 months); persons seeking evaluation or treatment for an STI; MSM.

- **Persons at risk for infection by percutaneous or mucosal exposure to blood**: Persons with recent injection drug use; household contacts of persons testing positive for HBsAg; residents and staff members of facilities for persons with developmental disabilities; healthcare and public safety personnel with reasonably anticipated risk for exposure to blood or blood-contaminated body fluids; patients on maintenance dialysis, including in-center or home hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis, and predialysis patients; patients with diabetes at the discretion of the treating clinician.

- **Other**: International travelers to countries with high or intermediate levels of endemic HBV infection (HBsAg prevalence of ≥ 2%); patients with HCV infection; patients with chronic liver disease — including, but not limited to, those with cirrhosis, fatty liver disease, alcoholic liver disease, autoimmune hepatitis, and an ALT or AST level > 2× the upper limit of normal.

Regarding preventative measures for hepatitis B virus infection, more specifically with respect to immunizations, the WHO 2024 guidelines recommend administering the first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine to all infants as soon as possible after birth, preferably within 24 hours. This should be followed by 2–3 additional doses to complete the primary immunization series.

### Persistence of HBsAg-specific antibodies and immune memory two to three decades after hepatitis B vaccination in adults [^116mW2HR]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2019). Low credibility.

This phase IV study in two countries with low HBV endemicity showed that 90.1% of individuals who had received a complete three- or four-dose primary HBsAg vaccination series during adulthood in routine practice had anti-HBs levels ≥ 10 mIU/mL 20–30 years later. All participants mounted an anamnestic response within 30 days of receiving an HBsAg vaccine challenge dose during the study, including the 9.9% of participants who had anti-HBs concentrations < 10 mIU/mL prechallenge. Both HBsAg-specific memory B and CD4+ T cells increased markedly postchallenge. These results indicate that the immune response can still be boosted 20–30 years after vaccination and suggest sustained immune memory and long-term protection 20–30 years following a complete primary HBsAg vaccination course in immunocompetent adults.

### Variation in hepatitis B immunization coverage rates associated with provider practices after the temporary suspension of the birth dose [^115N6Dpp]. BMC Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Further assessment of the scheduling of hepatitis B vaccination indicated that the typical timing of all three doses in the hepatitis B vaccine series varied across the five provider groups, both during the baseline period and following the hepatitis B birth dose suspension.

- **Variation in the timing of hepatitis B vaccinations**: In Groups A and B, where hepatitis B vaccination at birth was infrequent, children born following the birth dose suspension typically received their hepatitis B vaccine doses at similar or earlier ages compared to the baseline cohort. In Group C, where 49% of children received a hepatitis B birth vaccination and where an improvement in hepatitis B immunization coverage among 24-month-olds was observed, slight shifts toward delayed receipt of the first and second doses occurred during the suspension period; at the same time, the most common timing of the third dose remained at age 5–6 months (38% baseline vs. 31% suspension) or age 9–10 months (24% baseline vs. 28% suspension). In contrast, while 89–90% of children in Group D and Group E had received a hepatitis B vaccination at birth during the baseline period, the most common age at receipt of the first hepatitis B vaccination shifted to 5–6 months of age during the birth dose suspension (62% in each group). In these two provider groups, delays and less uniformity in the timing of the second and third dose of hepatitis B vaccine were also observed during the birth dose suspension.

### Cost effectiveness of hepatitis B vaccination at HIV counseling and testing sites [^113JLznK]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Despite recent significant achievements in controlling hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, immunizing high-risk groups against the disease remains a public health challenge in the United States. The aims of this article are to evaluate the projected cost-effectiveness of hepatitis B vaccination of adults attending two major types of publicly funded HIV counseling and testing sites (CTSs) — freestanding HIV CTSs and sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinics, and to compare the cost-effectiveness of alternative vaccination and testing strategies in different subgroups in this population.

- **Methods**: A decision model was developed to determine the economic and clinical consequences, from a societal perspective, of the following strategies in two hypothetical cohorts of 100,000 adults attending each type of site: (1) routine vaccination without screening, (2) screening for antibody to hepatitis B core antigen with an initial vaccine dose during the first visit, (3) screening and vaccination based on screening results, and (4) no intervention. Life expectancy, expected quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and medical care costs were estimated for each strategy and at each site.

- **Results**: Routine vaccination was both more effective and more cost-effective than either screening strategy; under base-case assumptions, routine vaccination would cost $4,400 both per QALY and per life year saved. Results for STD clinics were very similar in magnitude to those for freestanding CTSs. Results were most sensitive to clients' time and travel costs for return visits and the time-discount.

### Long term antibody response to hepatitis B vaccination beginning at birth and to subsequent booster vaccination [^111Xxtbe]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2003). Low credibility.

Few studies have examined the long-term persistence of antibodies after hepatitis B immunization beginning at birth and the response to a subsequent challenge with a booster dose of vaccine.

- **Methods**: Two groups of children received the hepatitis B vaccine on a schedule of birth and 1 and 6 months of age. Group 1 received the recombinant vaccine and a booster dose at 5 years of age. Group 2 received the plasma-derived vaccine and a booster dose at 9 years of age. Group 1 children were tested for antibodies after the primary vaccine series. All children were tested for antibodies before the administration of the booster dose and at 2 and 4 weeks and 1 year after the booster. In addition, all children were tested for markers of hepatitis B virus infection.

- **Results**: Antibody testing conducted after the primary series for children in Group 1 (n = 70) showed that 90% had protective antibody concentrations at 13 months of age, and testing before the booster dose showed that 41% had protective antibody concentrations. All children with protective antibody concentrations after the primary series had an anamnestic antibody response to the booster dose. In Group 2 (n = 41), 39% of children had protective antibody concentrations before the booster dose, and 93% had an anamnestic antibody response to the booster dose. One year after the booster dose, there were 26-fold and 11-fold declines in antibody concentration in Groups 1 and 2, respectively.

- **Conclusions**: A primary vaccination series with either plasma-derived or recombinant hepatitis B vaccine affords long-term protection for children.

### Hepatitis B vaccines [^114GyTgF]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

By the end of 2019, 189 (97%) countries had incorporated hepatitis B vaccination into their national immunization schedules. Globally, major progress has been achieved, with immunization coverage for three doses of the hepatitis B vaccine during infancy increasing from 1% in 1990 to 85% in 2019. This achievement was made possible through several developments, including the removal of cost-related barriers (less than $1 per dose) and the financial and logistical support from the Global Alliance for Vaccination and Immunization (GAVI), which has allowed the world's poorest countries to obtain the vaccine since 2001.

Pentavalent vaccine coverage in GAVI-supported countries increased from 1% in 2000 to 81% in 2019. However, there are still substantial variations across WHO regions. The Western Pacific region (90%), the American region (89%), and the Southeast Asia region (87%) are currently above the global average. In contrast, the European region (81%), the Eastern Mediterranean region (80%), and the African region (75%) have lower coverage.

### Progress in the prevention and control of viral hepatitis type B: Closing remarks [^116j4vuQ]. Journal of Medical Virology (2002). Low credibility.

Hepatitis Type B remains an important disease globally. Rapid advances have been made during the last two decades in the understanding of the biology of HBV, the complex interaction between the virus and the host, and the pathology and clinical aspects of infection. Mass vaccination has been shown to be a safe and highly effective means for the control and prevention of hepatitis B. The presence of a large worldwide reservoir of carriers requires continuous efforts to develop new drugs for the treatment of persistent HBV infection. Efforts to sustain immunization programs and make vaccines and drugs available to countries with limited resources are the main challenges to the eradication of hepatitis B in the next few decades.

### Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices for use of a hepatitis B vaccine with a novel adjuvant [^116n9Wrn]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). High credibility.

Hepatitis B (HepB) vaccination is the primary means of preventing infections and complications caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV). On February 21, 2018, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended Heplisav-B (HepB-CpG), a yeast-derived vaccine prepared with a novel adjuvant, administered as a 2-dose series (0, 1 month) for use in persons aged ≥ 18 years. The ACIP Hepatitis Vaccines Work Group conducted a systematic review of the evidence, including data from four randomized controlled trials assessing prevention of HBV infection and six randomized controlled trials assessing adverse events in adults. Seroprotective antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs) levels were achieved in 90.0%–100.0% of subjects receiving HepB-CpG (Dynavax Technologies Corporation), compared with 70.5%–90.2% of subjects receiving Engerix-B (GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals). The benefits of protection with 2 doses administered over 1 month make HepB-CpG an important option for prevention of HBV.

### Therapeutic vaccination for treatment of chronic hepatitis B [^115W8CeF]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2021). Low credibility.

Strong T cell responses to multiple HBV epitopes are important in the clearance of acute HBV. Most of our knowledge of HBV epitopes is skewed towards HLA‐A✱02‐restricted epitopes, although it is clear that HBV‐infected people with different human leucocyte antigen (HLA) alleles recognize other HBV epitopes. Peptide vaccine FP‐02.2 (HepTcell) incorporates nine HBV T cell epitopes in conserved regions of the HBV genome, which might increase its chances of being immunogenic among populations with various HLA types. Early results of a Phase I study (NCT02496897) confirmed safety when administered to participants with chronic HBV, and a Phase 2 trial is now recruiting (NCT04684914).

An advantage of vaccines that target conserved areas of the HBV genome is that they are more likely to be able to induce immunogenicity among different genotypes. Further work to discover immunoprotective HBV epitopes among different HBV genotypes in people with diverse HLA haplotypes is another approach to inform better vaccine design.

### Response to challenge dose among young adults vaccinated for hepatitis B as infants: Importance of detectable residual antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen [^1147ZsTo]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2015). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to determine whether a difference in antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs) response to a hepatitis B vaccine challenge dose existed among persons with a baseline anti-HBs level of 0 mIU/mL (group 1) and those with "non-zero" levels of 0.1–4.9 (group 2) and 5.0–9.9 (group 3) mIU/mL, according to the VITROS ECi anti-HBs assay.

The study design consisted of a subanalysis of a randomized clinical trial. Response was defined as a postchallenge anti-HBs level of at least 10 mIU/mL and a 4-fold rise in anti-HBs level 2 weeks following a single challenge dose of 10 vs 20 µg Engerix-B. Baseline was defined as the anti-HBs level immediately before administration of the challenge dose.

The setting for this study was a pediatric integrated healthcare system near Houston, Texas. The participants included three hundred nineteen US-born 16–19-year-olds who completed the hepatitis B vaccine series during the first year of life.

Results showed that one hundred seventy-eight persons had zero (group 1), and one hundred forty-one (114 group 2 and 27 group 3) had non-zero anti-HBs levels at baseline. Response to the challenge dose was significantly higher among those with non-zero vs zero anti-HBs levels, irrespective of challenge dosage; only one person with a non-zero anti-HBs level failed to respond to the challenge dose (group 3, 27/27 [100%] vs. group 2, 113/114 [99%] vs. group 1, 145/178 [82%]; p < 0.0001).

In conclusion, among participants with residual anti-HBs levels less than 10 mIU/mL 16–19 years after primary hepatitis B vaccination during infancy, non-zero anti-HBs levels, with rare exceptions, indicated persistence of immune memory to HBsAg.

### Improving timeliness of hepatitis B vaccine birth dose administration [^115cMa1s]. Hospital Pediatrics (2021). Low credibility.

When given within 24 hours of birth, the hepatitis B vaccine is up to 90% effective in preventing perinatal infection. The American Academy of Pediatrics now recommends administration within 24 hours for infants with a birth weight greater than 2 kg, but a national benchmark for compliance with this time frame has not been established. We aimed to increase the monthly average of eligible newborns receiving the vaccine on time from 40% to 80% over a 9-month period.

- **Methods**: A series of plan-do-study-act cycles were conducted to improve the timeliness of hepatitis B vaccine birth dose administration among newborns in the level 1 nursery at our academic community hospital. Interventions included staff education, nurse-driven consent and vaccine ordering, and earlier initial newborn assessments performed by nursing staff. Our primary outcome was the monthly percentage of newborns receiving the vaccine within 24 hours of birth, and our secondary outcome was the frequency of nonvaccination events. Statistical process control was used to analyze the effectiveness of interventions.

- **Results**: Our mean monthly rate of vaccine administration within the 24-hour time frame increased from 40% to 92%. The predischarge vaccination rate improved from a mean of 13 to 61 cases between infants discharged without vaccination.

- **Conclusions**: Nurse-led interventions, including the ability to obtain consent and incorporation of the vaccine into our nurse-activated admission order set, were significant contributors to improvement in the timeliness of hepatitis B vaccine administration.

### Comparison of a triple antigen and a single antigen recombinant vaccine for adult hepatitis B vaccination [^116bVGbt]. Journal of Medical Virology (2001). Low credibility.

Hepatitis B and its sequelae are a major public health problem. Vaccines have been available for almost 20 years; however, the disease still remains a global problem. Many factors contribute to the failure to control hepatitis B, including the limited nature of the vaccination programs implemented initially. Only relatively recently has mass childhood vaccination begun to be implemented, and vaccination of high-risk groups, other than healthcare workers, is still not general policy.

Additional factors contributing to the continued persistence of hepatitis B in the developed world include the present vaccines not being fully utilized by those recommended for vaccination. Even when vaccination is carried out appropriately, there remain some who fail to achieve adequate protection. Clearly, the protection of at-risk groups who have an inadequate response to vaccines, and those who are unwilling or unable to comply with protracted multi-dose vaccine regimens, could be improved if there were a more potent vaccine and/or a shorter vaccination regimen available.

Adults who had never been vaccinated against hepatitis B were randomized to receive a vaccination course of either a present single antigen (S) vaccine (Recombivax-HB) or a novel triple antigen (S, pre-S1, and pre-S2) recombinant vaccine (Hepacare Medeva Pharma plc). Doses were given at baseline, and 1 month and 6 months later. Hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) levels were measured at 2, 4, 6, and 7 months after beginning vaccination. The primary efficacy parameter was the degree of protection, measured as the percentage.

### Effect of combination vaccines on hepatitis B vaccine compliance in children in the United States [^114XQCxn]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2017). Low credibility.

An increasingly crowded immunization schedule threatens the completion and compliance of hepatitis B vaccinations (HepB), the primary method of hepatitis B prevention. Combination vaccines have been proposed to alleviate this problem.

- **Methods**: Data from the 2011 National Immunization Survey Public-Use Data File were utilized (GSK study identifier: HO-11–770) to compare HepB completion and compliance rates between three groups of children: those who received the HepB combination vaccine, those who received a non-HepB combination vaccine, and those who received the HepB single-antigen vaccine only. Completion was defined as the accumulation of three HepB doses by 18 months. Compliance was defined as the receipt of vaccine doses within the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices' recommended age ranges.

- **Results**: Of a sample of 4,040,116 children, 39.4% received a HepB combination vaccine, 43.0% received a non-HepB combination vaccine, and 17.5% received a HepB single-antigen vaccine. Overall, 91.2% of children completed all three recommended doses, but only 61.8% completed them at age-appropriate times. Those receiving the single-antigen only (odds ratio = 0.25, 95% confidence interval: 0.17–0.35) or non-HepB combination vaccines (odds ratio = 0.50, 95% confidence interval: 0.37–0.69) were substantially less likely to complete three doses of HepB than those who received the HepB combination vaccine.

- **Conclusions**: Although completion rates were high, a large proportion of children did not receive HepB doses at age-appropriate times. The combination vaccine was associated with both higher completion and compliance rates.

### Immunogenicity and safety of a tri-antigenic versus a mono-antigenic hepatitis B vaccine in adults (PROTECT): a randomised, double-blind, phase 3 trial [^116kAnr6]. The Lancet. Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

The seroprotection rate (SPR) of hepatitis B vaccination in adults is suboptimal. The aim of this study was to compare the SPR of a tri-antigenic hepatitis B vaccine (TAV) with a mono-antigenic vaccine (MAV) in adults of all ages.

- **Methods**: This was a multicentre, double-blind, phase 3, randomised controlled trial (PROTECT) comparing the immunogenicity and safety of TAV with MAV in 28 community and hospital sites in the United States, Finland, Canada, and Belgium. Adults (aged ≥ 18 years), seronegative for hepatitis B virus (HBV) and including those with well-controlled common chronic conditions, were randomly assigned (1:1) and stratified by study centre and age according to a web-based permuted blocked randomisation. Participants received either TAV or MAV, which were administered as an intramuscular dose (1 mL) of TAV (10 μg; Sci-B-Vac, VBI Vaccines [SciVac, Rehovot, Israel]) or MAV (20 μg; Engerix-B [GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, Rixensart, Belgium]) on days 0, 28, and 168, with six study visits and 24 weeks of follow-up after the third vaccination. Participants, investigators, and those assessing outcomes were masked to group assignment. The co-primary outcomes were to show non-inferiority of the SPRs 4 weeks after the third vaccination with TAV versus MAV in adults aged 18 years and older, as well as superiority in adults aged 45 years and older. SPR was defined as the percentage of participants attaining anti-HBs titres of 10 mIU/mL or higher. Non-inferiority of TAV to MAV was concluded if the lower limit of the 95% CI for the between-group difference was greater than -5%.

### Hepatitis B vaccines [^112UHDGe]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

Hepatitis B is caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV), which infects the liver and may lead to chronic liver disease, including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. HBV represents a worldwide public health problem, causing major morbidity and mortality. Affordable, safe, and effective, hepatitis B vaccines are the best tools we have to control and prevent hepatitis B. In 2019, coverage of three doses of the hepatitis B vaccine reached 85% worldwide compared to around 30% in 2000.

The effective implementation of hepatitis B vaccination programs has resulted in a substantial decrease in the HBV carrier rate and hepatitis B-related morbidity and mortality. This article summarizes the great triumphs of the hepatitis B vaccine, the first anticancer and virus-like-particle-based vaccine. In addition, existing unresolved issues and future perspectives on hepatitis B vaccination required for global prevention of HBV infection are discussed.

### Excellent response rate to a double dose of the combined hepatitis A and B vaccine in previous nonresponders to hepatitis B vaccine [^1132KgjH]. Journal of Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

The hepatitis B vaccine has been shown to be highly efficient in preventing hepatitis B. However, 5%-10% of individuals fail to develop protective levels (≥ 10 mIU/mL) of antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs) and are considered nonresponders.

- **Methods**: A total of 48 nonresponders and 20 subjects naive to the HBV vaccine received a double dose of combined hepatitis A and B vaccine (Twinrix) at 0, 1, and 6 months. The levels of anti-HBs and antibodies to hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) were determined before vaccination and 1 month after each dose.

- **Results**: Among 44 nonresponders, protective anti-HBs levels were found in 26 (59%) after the first dose and in 42 (95%) after the third dose. Among the control subjects, the corresponding figures were 10% and 100%, respectively. All subjects seroconverted to anti-HAV. The titers of both anti-HBs and anti-HAV were lower in the previously nonresponsive subjects (P < .01).

- **Conclusion**: Revaccination of nonresponders to the standard hepatitis B vaccine regimen with a double dose of the combined hepatitis A and B vaccine was highly effective. This is most likely explained by the increased dose, a positive bystander effect conferred by the hepatitis A vaccine, or both.

### Experience with hepatitis A and B vaccines [^113pzA8v]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

The lengthy history of efforts to understand the pathogenesis and means of preventing and controlling both hepatitis A and B is noteworthy for many exceptional scientific achievements. Among these are the development of vaccines to prevent the spread of infection through the induction of active immunity to hepatitis A virus (HAV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV). The first plasma-derived hepatitis B vaccine was licensed in the United States in 1981 and was replaced by recombinant hepatitis B vaccines in 1986 and 1989. Vaccines to prevent HAV infection were licensed in the United States in 1995 and 1996. Subsequently, combination vaccines that included both hepatitis A and B vaccine components, or the hepatitis B component in combination with other commonly administered vaccines, were licensed in the United States. Despite significant reductions in hepatitis-related morbidity and mortality that have resulted from widespread use of these vaccines, vaccine-preventable morbidity and mortality still occur.

The purposes of this article are to review clinical trial and other experiences with hepatitis A and B vaccines in healthy individuals as well as in those with chronic liver disease, infected with the human immunodeficiency virus, or requiring hemodialysis; describe the impact that these vaccines and national recommendations for vaccination have had on reducing the incidence of HAV and HBV infection; and recommend expansion of these recommendations to include universal vaccination of adults as a means of further reducing the burden of viral hepatitis.

### Vaccines and immunotherapies against hepatitis B and hepatitis C viruses [^114iFsJL]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2007). Low credibility.

Both hepatitis B and hepatitis C viruses (HBV and HCV) cause chronic infections worldwide that are associated with the development of liver diseases, ranging from mild liver inflammation to hepatocellular carcinomas. While efficient preventive vaccines are available for HBV, efforts are ongoing to develop one for HCV. Both infections share the challenge that current therapeutic agents for established infections are inefficient, toxic, or associated with the development of resistance. Thus, novel immune-based therapies are actively being developed to complement or replace standard antiviral treatments. A major area of effort is the development of therapeutic vaccines. Peptide-, recombinant protein-, or viral vector-based vaccines have been engineered and tested at preclinical and clinical levels. Methods to adjuvant these vaccines are being pursued, including approaches based on combining vaccines of different types. This review outlines major advances in the field of both HBV and HCV therapeutic vaccine development, with a particular focus on candidates presented at the 12th International Symposium on Viral Hepatitis and Liver Disease (July 2006, Paris, France).

### Therapeutic vaccination for treatment of chronic hepatitis B [^115BxZHY]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2021). Low credibility.

Selection of vaccine vector:

To give the best chance of inducing the strong T cell responses required to clear HBV infection, vaccine candidates should use platforms known to induce T cell responses of the highest magnitude. Several vaccination approaches designed to induce high‐magnitude HBV T cell responses are currently being evaluated in clinical trials. These include vaccine VBI‐2601, which utilizes a virus‐like particle platform (ACTRN12619001210167), and the administration of DNA vaccine JNJ‐64300535 using electroporation technology (NCT03463369).

Other strategies known to induce strong CD8 T cell responses use vectors given in heterologous prime‐boost strategies and have been successful in inducing functional cure in animal models of chronic hepatitis B. Vaccination with particulate HBsAg and HBcAg has been successful in inducing HBsAg loss in a murine model of chronic HBV infection when combined with a booster vaccination using a modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA)‐encoding HBV core and surface regions. This approach of combining HBsAg and HBcAg with MVA boost vaccination requires further investigation in human studies.

Simian adenoviral vector prime MVA vectors boost vaccine strategies are among the most potent vaccine combinations for inducing T cell responses in humans. There are several advantages to these platforms that might be advantageous for HBV therapy. First, they are able to encode large immunogens, making it possible for almost the entire HBV genome to be incorporated into the vaccine. This increases the probability that T cell responses towards multiple antigens will be elicited.

### Implementation of newborn hepatitis B vaccination — worldwide, 2006 [^112KBFgi]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2008). Low credibility.

Globally, hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections are a major cause of cirrhosis and liver cancer, resulting in an estimated 620,000 deaths annually. In 1992, the World Health Organization (WHO) set a goal for all countries to introduce the hepatitis B (HepB) vaccine into national routine infant immunization programs by 1997. In countries where a high percentage of HBV infections are acquired perinatally (where the general population prevalence of chronic HBV infection is ≥ 8%), WHO recommends administering the first HepB vaccine dose within 24 hours of birth.

- **Global uptake**: As of 2006, the HepB vaccine had been incorporated into national infant immunization programs in 165 (85%) of 193 WHO member states. However, global implementation of the birth dose, which is critical for preventing perinatal HBV transmission, remained low in many regions.

- **Prevalence of chronic infection**: Among 2004 birth cohorts in 130 countries with a high (≥ 8%) chronic HBV infection prevalence, HepB vaccine birth dose coverage was 36%. These findings highlight the global need to implement this key hepatitis B prevention strategy more widely.

### Hepatitis B vaccine effectiveness among vaccinated children in Africa: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1142feyA]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Hepatitis B virus infection and its complications are a significant global issue. Children represent a high-risk population for HBV infection. Neonatal HBV vaccination is the most effective measure in preventing HBV infection, especially in countries with intermediate to high HBV endemicity. The WHO recommends that all infants receive the hepatitis B vaccine. A positive immune response to this vaccine is indicated by the development of anti-HBs at a titer greater than 10 mIU/mL. Vaccine effectiveness is typically assessed after completion of the recommended vaccination schedule, ideally 1 to 3 months following the final dose.

In this systematic review, the presence of anti-HBs was utilized as evidence of seroprotection provided by the hepatitis B vaccine. The studies included used both recombinant and plasma-derived HBV vaccines, administered through varying vaccination schedules. An anti-HBs level exceeding 100 mIU/mL is a crucial marker for good responders, although not all studies reported this data. Conversely, an anti-HBs level above 10 mIU/mL was a consistent endpoint across all included studies when assessing the vaccine's effectiveness. Therefore, this study measures vaccine effectiveness by considering an anti-HBs level greater than 10 mIU/mL as the threshold for seroprotectiveness among the vaccinated children.

### Comparative long term immunogenicity of two recombinant hepatitis B vaccines and the effect of a booster dose given after five years in a low endemicity country [^112n8fjS]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Few data are available concerning the long-term immunogenicity of the pediatric doses of hepatitis B vaccines administered to preteenagers. The long-term effect of the booster dose in teenagers is unknown. We evaluated the immunogenicity of two pediatric hepatitis vaccines after primary vaccination and following a booster dose.

- **Methods**: A prospective 15-year follow-up study on the immunogenicity of two hepatitis B vaccines was initiated in 1995 in Quebec City, Canada. One year apart, 1129 children aged 8–10 years received the Engerix-B 10 microg (EB) vaccine, and 1126 received the Recombivax-HB 2.5 microg (RB) vaccine, both following a 0-, 1-, 6-month schedule. After five years, one-third of each cohort was randomly selected. A booster dose of either EB 10 microg or RB 5 microg was administered according to the vaccine used in the primary immunization. Antibodies were measured before, one month after, and one year post-booster injection.

- **Results**: Before the booster dose, anti-hepatitis B surface antibody (HBs) was detected in 94.7% of the EB subjects and 95.2% of the RB subjects (P = 0.85). The geometric mean titer (GMT) was higher for the EB group compared to the RB group, with 252 mIU/mL versus 66 mIU/mL, respectively (P < 0.0001). One month after the booster dose, 99.9% of subjects in both groups had anti-HBs levels ≥ 10 mIU/mL. The anti-HBs GMT was 113,201 mIU/mL in the EB group and 16,623 mIU/mL in the RB groups (P < 0.0001). One year after the booster, 99.3% of subjects in the EB group and 100% in the RB group had detectable anti-HBs, with 97.9% and 98.5%, respectively.

### Hepatitis B vaccines [^1155un3A]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

As treatment for chronic hepatitis B is not curative, therapeutic immunization for persons with chronic HBV infection and restoring the defective immune tolerance to HBV remains an important goal. Great efforts have been taken using different approaches to stimulate the humoral and/or cellular immune responses. However, until now, the clinical efficacy shown in clinical trials in humans is limited. Also, new vaccine formulations have been and are being developed to meet the challenges of nonresponse or low response among older adults and immunocompromised individuals. Additionally, novel injection devices (e.g. Uniject) and intradermal, oral, and nasal prophylactic hepatitis B vaccines, which might be easier to administer than injections, are under investigation.

Following the endorsement of the Global Health Sector Strategy on viral hepatitis (2016–2021) by the World Health Assembly, the WHO developed ambitious targets for the elimination of hepatitis, including HBV as public health threats by 2030 [74]. Service targets include further improvement in childhood vaccine coverage, major increases in birth-dose vaccine coverage or other methods for mother-to-child HBV prevention, and massive expansion of case finding. These service improvements are aligned with impact targets of a 90% reduction in new HBV infections and a 65% reduction in HBV-related deaths compared with 2015 WHO estimates.

### Randomized trial to determine safety and immunogenicity of two strategies for hepatitis B vaccination in healthy urban adolescents in the United States [^116uDHnW]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Multiple studies have shown excellent response rates after hepatitis B immunization in youth; however, one previous study conducted in urban youth demonstrated poor responses.

- **Methods**: Urban youth, ages 12 to 17 years, at participating Adolescent Medicine Trials Network for HIV/AIDS Interventions Clinical/Research sites were randomized to receive either 2 doses of Recombivax HB (10 µg hepatitis B surface antigen) or Twinrix (20 µg hepatitis B surface antigen and 720 EL.U hepatitis A antigen) at 0 and 24 weeks. Safety data were collected, and antibody measures were performed at 0, 28, and 76 weeks.

- **Results**: A total of 123 subjects were enrolled, and 102 had week 28 serum samples available for antibody measure. A positive response (serum antibody ≥ 10 mIU/mL) to hepatitis B antigen was documented in 41 of 47 (87.2%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 74.3%-95.2%) Recombivax HB recipients and in 52 of 55 (94.6%; 95% CI 84.9%-98.9%) Twinrix recipients (P = 0.295). In an adjusted analysis, those identified as Hispanic ethnicity (N = 86) were more likely to have a positive response (odds ratio 7.38, 95% CI 1.56–34.95; P = 0.0018), whereas those who identified as not heterosexual (N = 9) were less likely to respond (odds ratio = 0.12, 95% CI 0.02–0.74). The majority of youth in the Twinrix arm were hepatitis A antibody positive at baseline (26/51; 51%); however, 24 of 25 hepatitis A antibody negative youth responded to the hepatitis A component. Both vaccines were safe.

- **Conclusions**: Response rate to 2 doses of Recombivax HB in urban youth is lower than previous studies.

### Hepatitis B vaccines [^113cG6sQ]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

A variety of hepatitis B vaccine schedules have been used due to different requirements for inducing protective immunity, which vary by product and the recipient's age. Traditionally, the standard 3-dose hepatitis B vaccine series comprises two priming doses administered one month apart, followed by a third dose six months after the first. Today, the WHO offers several options for integrating hepatitis B vaccines into existing infant immunization schedules. These schedules include a monovalent birth dose followed by two doses of either monovalent or combination vaccine at 1 and 6 months, 2, 4, and 6 months, 3, 5, and 11 months, 8, 12, and 16 weeks with a follow-up at 12 or 15 months, or 6, 10, and 14 weeks, as outlined by the WHO's Expanded Programme on Immunization schedule. Worldwide, a variety of hepatitis B vaccine schedules are implemented effectively. Generally, preferred schedules are those that are effective with minimal additional visits, promoting compliance and simplifying logistics.

IgG antibodies to HBsAg (anti-HBs) following vaccination completion are a marker of immunity to HBV. An anti-HBs antibody concentration of 10 mIU/mL or more, measured 1–3 months after the last dose of the primary vaccination series, is regarded as a reliable marker of protection against HBV infection.

### Hepatitis B vaccines [^1133Q1de]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

The success of hepatitis B immunization

- **History and development of the first anticancer vaccine**: The first hepatitis B vaccines, commercially available since 1982, were plasma-derived vaccines. The American microbiologist Maurice Hilleman produced these vaccines by harvesting subvirion particles of HBsAg (22-nm particles) from the plasma of asymptomatic chronic HBV-infected donors. The particles in the pooled plasma were highly purified, and any residual infectious particles were inactivated by various combinations of urea, pepsin, formaldehyde, and heat. Plasma-derived vaccines have been investigated with success in several hundred million individuals, leading to the first licensed hepatitis B vaccines. These first HBV vaccines were manufactured under the name Heptavax B (Merck) and Hevac B (Institut Pasteur) and targeted a number of high-risk groups, the main focus of the immunization program at that time.

Although concerns about the safety of these vaccines regarding transmission of bloodborne pathogens, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), have proven to be unfounded, public anxieties over the safety of the plasma-derived vaccine persisted and hampered its acceptance in many populations. Other barriers to high coverage included high vaccine costs and the lack of global vaccine policies.

In 1986, the first genetically engineered hepatitis B vaccine was developed with recombinant HBsAg, resulting in a second generation of HBV vaccines that completely replaced plasma-derived vaccines.

### Approaches, progress, and challenges to hepatitis C vaccine development [^116aGYA2]. Gastroenterology (2019). Low credibility.

Trials of vaccines designed to elicit T-cell responses

It is a challenge to translate what we have learned about protective T-cell responses into the design of vaccines that elicit these responses. The most effective vaccines might induce sterilizing immunity, but most hepatitis C virus (HCV)-associated diseases are caused by chronic infection. Immune responses that prevent the persistence of infection could decrease HCV morbidity and mortality without reducing the incidence of infection. The feasibility of testing vaccines that reduce rates of chronic HCV infection, rather than reducing the incidence of infection, has been studied. Reducing viremia during the early acute phase of infection with a vaccine could reduce HCV transmission by lowering the residual infectious virus titers in injecting equipment. So, it might be reasonable to lower the bar for vaccine development, setting goals of decreased persistence or population HCV RNA levels to effect reductions in disease sequelae and transmission.

Another approach is to target the relatively conserved viral proteins within the nonstructural region of the genome to induce a broad T-cell response, with or without including envelope glycoprotein as a target. The nonstructural (NS) proteins (NS3, NS4, and NS5) are more conserved across HCV genotypes than the envelope glycoproteins and are the dominant targets of CD8+ T cells. A variety of strategies have been developed to introduce NS protein antigens in an immunogenic way, including DNA-based immunization, DNA priming followed by recombinant virus vector or HCV protein boosting, and recombinant adenovirus priming.

### Protective efficacy, immunotherapeutic potential, and safety of hepatitis B vaccines [^1112D9aW]. Journal of Medical Virology (2006). Low credibility.

Hepatitis B vaccines are highly effective and safe. They have been incorporated into national immunization programs in over 150 countries. The major humoral immune response targets the common "a" determinant of the surface antigen protein of the virus. Approximately 5–10% of healthy immunocompetent subjects do not mount an antibody response (anti-HBs). Non-response is associated with different HLA-DR alleles and impaired Th cell response, along with factors such as the route of injection, age, gender, and body mass. Important hepatitis B surface antigen variants have also been identified, which may impact immunization and routine screening of blood, blood products, tissues, and organs for transplantation.

- **Strategies for hepatitis B immunization**: Over 1 billion doses of the hepatitis B vaccine have been administered with an outstanding safety record. There is no evidence linking hepatitis B vaccines with sudden infant death syndrome, chronic fatigue syndrome, or multiple sclerosis (MS).

- **Advancements in treatment studies**: Several studies are investigating the treatment of chronic hepatitis B infection through immunization with multiple antigenic components, combinations of vaccines with antiviral drugs and cytokines, T cell vaccines, DNA vaccines alone or with DNA-encoded immunomodulatory cytokines, and direct genetic manipulation of antigen-presenting cells.

### SPL drug information for hepatitis B vaccine (recombinant adjuvanted) [^111vGXpw]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Regarding the use of the hepatitis B vaccine IM (also known as Recombivax HB, Heplisav-B) in pregnant patients for all trimesters, it should be used only if the benefits outweigh potential risks. There is evidence of fetal harm in animals. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends vaccination during pregnancy when the likelihood of disease exposure is high, potential infection would cause harm to the mother or fetus, and when the vaccine is unlikely to cause harm.

The drug hepatitis B vaccine IM (also known as Recombivax HB, Heplisav-B) is classified under category B2 in the Australian categorization system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug has been taken by only a limited number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age, without an increase in the frequency of malformation or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the human fetus having been observed. Studies in animals are inadequate or may be lacking, but available data show no evidence of an increased occurrence of fetal damage.

### Progress toward the elimination of mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B virus - worldwide, 2016–2021 [^113NyV8x]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2022). Low credibility.

Immunization activities - Immunization is a key intervention to prevent mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of the hepatitis B virus (HBV). The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that all newborns receive a timely dose of the hepatitis B birth dose (HepB-BD) followed by two to three additional doses of hepatitis B vaccine (HepB) according to national schedules. Countries report immunization data to WHO annually through the WHO and UNICEF Joint Reporting Form. WHO and UNICEF review reported coverage data and surveys to generate country-specific coverage estimates. This activity was reviewed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.

By 2020, 190 (98%) of 194 countries had introduced universal infant hepatitis B vaccination compared with 186 (96%) in 2016. In 2020, 110 (57%) countries provided HepB-BD to all newborns, a 10% increase from 100 (52%) in 2016. During 2016–2020, 33 to 34 (17%-18%) countries, mostly in the European Region, administered HepB-BD selectively to newborns of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive mothers (i.e. selective or targeted birth dose vaccination) each year. The number of countries that had not introduced routine HepB-BD vaccination declined by 15%, from 60 (31%) in 2016 to 51 (26%) in 2020. Most of these countries are in the African Region where 34 (72%) of 47 countries do not provide a HepB-BD.

### A randomized trial of alternative two- and three-dose hepatitis B vaccination regimens in adolescents: Antibody responses, safety, and immunologic memory [^115SKd1d]. Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

Hoping to increase hepatitis B (HB) vaccination of adolescents, the study aimed to:

- **Assess antibody generation**: Study if modified regimens of the recombinant HB vaccine, Recombivax HB (2 or 3 doses of 5 or 10 microg given over 4 or 6 months), induce protective anti-hepatitis B surface antibody [anti-HBsAb] levels (≥ 10 mIU/mL) comparable to the recommended regimen (5 microg at 0, 1, and 6 months).
- **Early response measurement**: Measure early antibody response following a single dose.
- **Immunologic memory evaluation**: Assess immunologic memory after 2- and 3-dose regimens.

One thousand twenty-six adolescents were randomized to one of five treatment groups (10 microg at 0 and 4 or 0 and 6 months; 5 microg at 0 and 6 or 0, 2, and 4 or 0, 1, and 6 months) in an open trial. Anti-HBsAb was measured in all participants just before and one month after the last dose, and at several other times in a subset of vaccinees. Anti-HBsAb response to a booster dose two years later was examined to assess immunologic memory in participants vaccinated with 5 microg at 0 and 6 or 0, 1, and 6 months.

All regimens induced ≥ 10 mIU/mL of anti-HBs in ≥ 95% of vaccinees. Geometric mean titers ranged from 674.8 to 3049.4 mIU/mL. Geometric mean titers were higher with regimens using the following:

- **Dose comparison**: 10 versus 5 microg.
- **Number of doses**: 3 versus 2 doses.
- **Vaccination intervals**: 6 versus 4 months.

After six months, 63.8% of vaccinees given one 10-microg dose had ≥ 10 mIU/mL of anti-HBsAb versus 41.6% after one 5-microg dose. Participants vaccinated with either two or three 5-microg doses retained robust immunologic memory.

### Prevention strategies for blood-borne viruses in the era of vaccines, direct acting antivirals, and antiretroviral therapy [^113XvZEF]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2016). Low credibility.

Effective immune protection in the community contributes greatly to the prevention and eradication of viral infections. A safe and effective vaccine against HBV has been available since 1982, and nowadays, vaccination against HBV has been successfully implemented with 47 European countries having adopted universal HBV vaccination programs. HBV vaccination leads to the appearance of anti-HBs: generally, levels > 100 U/l are considered to represent a good response, while levels > 10 U/l are still protective. In individuals at risk from HBV infection, antibody levels should be rechecked after 10 years. The introduction of the vaccine has contributed to a 96% decline in the incidence of acute hepatitis B in children and adolescents.

For HEV, there is currently no global vaccine available even though in 2011, the first vaccine to prevent HEV infection (HEV239 vaccine) was registered in China. It remains to be seen whether this will soon be available in other countries. Up to now, there is no effective prophylactic vaccine available for HCV or HIV infections. Several vaccine candidates for HCV are in phase I/II clinical trials, but their clinical usefulness remains to be demonstrated. Similarly, HIV vaccine research has been ongoing for several years, but an effective and safe preparation has thus far remained elusive.

- **Secondary prevention**: Secondary prevention strategies aim to identify infected people and to provide appropriate medical management to reduce the risk of chronic diseases.

### Hepatitis B vaccines [^1143Rqe4]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

Hepatitis B is caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV), which infects the liver and may lead to chronic liver disease, including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. HBV represents a worldwide public health problem, causing major morbidity and mortality. Affordable, safe, and effective hepatitis B vaccines are the best tools we have to control and prevent hepatitis B. In 2019, the coverage of three doses of the hepatitis B vaccine reached 85% worldwide compared to around 30% in 2000. The effective implementation of hepatitis B vaccination programs has resulted in a substantial decrease in the HBV carrier rate and hepatitis B-related morbidity and mortality. This article summarizes the great triumphs of the hepatitis B vaccine, the first anticancer and virus-like particle-based vaccine. Additionally, existing unresolved issues and future perspectives on hepatitis B vaccination required for global prevention of HBV infection are discussed.

### Immune response of hepatitis B vaccine among persons with diabetes: A systematic review of the literature [^116DUw4t]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Administration of additional doses of the hepatitis B vaccine improves the proportion of persons responding to it. Additional doses have not caused unusual adverse reactions. It is recommended that healthcare personnel at continuing risk of hepatitis B exposure and infants with perinatal hepatitis B exposure repeat a primary series of the hepatitis B vaccine if they are found to be nonresponsive to the initial series. Among healthcare personnel who did not respond following a primary series, 67.6% mounted a protective response to up to three additional doses.

Data exclusively on revaccination of nonresponding persons with diabetes are sparse. Although postvaccination serology to determine responses among adults with diabetes is not cost-effective (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2011, unpublished data) and not recommended, using schedules requiring four rather than three doses or administering additional doses of the hepatitis B vaccine remains an option.

A longer interval between the final two doses of the primary hepatitis B vaccine series has been associated with higher final anti-HBs levels in general. Findings from this review suggest that a longer interval between the final two doses also is associated with increased seroprotection proportions among persons with diabetes. Excessively long intervals have the drawback of increasing the risk for acquisition of HBV infection among those with an incomplete series.

Other strategies that may augment the response to the hepatitis B vaccine in persons with diabetes include the use of novel adjuvants, higher dosages, or combination vaccines.

### Hepatitis B vaccines [^117CLAkP]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

The recombinant hepatitis B vaccines are highly immunogenic. A variety of immunization schedules have been shown to induce levels of seroprotection of greater than 95% in healthy infants, children, and young adults. However, studies indicated that older adults (> 40 years of age) are less likely to achieve a seroprotective response to hepatitis B vaccination, and this drops to 60%–70% in adults aged 60 years and older [33]. Obesity, smoking, HIV infection, genetic factors, and chronic disease may also result in lower response rates. The recombinant HBsAg particles differ from natural viral particles in lacking the preS domain of HBsAg and lacking glycosylation due to their production in yeast [34]. Mammalian cell-derived vaccines contain glycosylated pre-S1 and pre-S2 proteins, in addition to the major HBsAg protein. By covering not only the HBsAg S epitope, these vaccines, as well as some new vaccine adjuvants that have been and are being developed, have been shown to be more immunogenic compared to the second-generation vaccines. Although they are too costly to be included in universal vaccination programs, they can confer protection to immunocompromised persons and nonresponders [35].

- **Implementing strategies for hepatitis B vaccination**: When hepatitis B vaccines became available, strategies for HBV control were initially focused on vaccination of high-risk groups [28]. However, high-risk individuals are mostly difficult to reach and are often infected before vaccination. Consequently, coverage of three doses of hepatitis B vaccine remained low in most high-risk groups.
