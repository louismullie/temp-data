## Question

At what lymphocyte count are you concerned for lymphoma?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking at what lymphocyte count we should be concerned for lymphoma. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the question refers to lymphocytosis versus lymphopenia. Then, I should verify disease-specific thresholds that actually trigger concern or action. Next, I will review prognostic cutoffs that, while not diagnostic, signal worse outcomes. After that, I need to consider age-adjusted thresholds for incidental lymphocytosis. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically grounded answer with clear next steps and caveats.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame, because "concerned for lymphoma" can mean two different things: elevated lymphocytes suggesting a lymphoproliferative disorder, or low lymphocytes indicating poor host immunity and worse prognosis in established lymphoma. I need to ensure I'm not conflating these scenarios, as the thresholds and implications differ substantially [^8d5f5fa0] [^dc25af28].

> For lymphocytosis, I should confirm the CLL/SLL threshold, since that is the prototypical lymphoma where absolute lymphocyte count drives diagnosis and staging. The diagnostic bar for CLL is an absolute clonal B-lymphocyte count of at least 5 × 10⁹/L, whereas counts below that, in the absence of nodes or symptoms, meet criteria for monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis and warrant observation rather than treatment, so an ALC ≥ 5 × 10⁹/L is where concern for CLL/SLL rises meaningfully [^71d82b88] [^bfe85dfc] [^82e98e30].

> Wait, let me verify the age effect for incidental lymphocytosis, because many older adults have small clonal B-cell populations. In patients 50 years and older, studies suggest that an ALC around 4.0–4.4 × 10⁹/L is a reasonable trigger for smear review and flow cytometry to evaluate for a clonal process, acknowledging that many such cases will be MBL rather than requiring immediate therapy, so the threshold for "concern" is slightly lower than the formal CLL diagnostic cutoff in older adults [^64f2a2a6].

> For lymphopenia, I need to check which cutoffs carry prognostic weight across lymphoma subtypes. In advanced classical Hodgkin lymphoma, lymphocytopenia defined as less than 8% of the WBC and/or less than 600/μL is an adverse factor in the International Prognostic Score and correlates with worse survival, so an ALC below about 0.6 × 10⁹/L should heighten concern for outcome even if it is not diagnostic of lymphoma itself [^161e2e45] [^96a111cf].

> Hold on, I should verify DLBCL data, because lymphopenia at diagnosis is repeatedly linked to worse outcomes. Multiple studies show that an ALC below roughly 0.84–1.0 × 10⁹/L at diagnosis independently predicts inferior overall and progression-free survival in DLBCL, so an ALC in this range is a red flag for prognosis and may influence risk-adapted management discussions, even though it is not a diagnostic threshold [^393e9f34] [^4c0c64b9] [^dc25af28].

> Let me consider T-cell lymphomas briefly. In peripheral T-cell lymphoma, unspecified, lymphopenia less than 1,000/μL has been associated with worse survival and chemoresponse, reinforcing that an ALC below about 1.0 × 10⁹/L signals higher risk in that entity as well, again as a prognostic rather than diagnostic marker [^50a85651].

> I should double-check that I'm not implying treatment decisions based on ALC alone in CLL/SLL, because that would be misleading. NCCN and iwCLL emphasize that an elevated ALC alone is not an indication to treat in the absence of symptoms, cytopenias, bulky disease, or rapid progression, so even when the ALC exceeds 5 × 10⁹/L, "concern" should translate into staging and surveillance, not automatic therapy [^8d5f5fa0] [^1763a9a6] [^25253402].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure the answer is precise. For lymphocytosis, an ALC ≥ 5 × 10⁹/L is the diagnostic threshold for CLL/SLL and should prompt hematology evaluation. In adults 50 and older, an ALC around 4.0–4.4 × 10⁹/L warrants smear review and flow cytometry to assess for clonal B-cell disease, recognizing many will be MBL. For lymphopenia, an ALC < 0.6 × 10⁹/L is prognostically adverse in classical Hodgkin lymphoma, and an ALC < 0.84–1.0 × 10⁹/L is associated with worse outcomes in DLBCL and some T-cell lymphomas, so these ranges should trigger closer risk stratification and follow-up even if they are not diagnostic by themselves [^71d82b88] [^64f2a2a6] [^161e2e45] [^393e9f34] [^50a85651].

> But wait, what if the lymphocyte count is normal and the clinician still suspects lymphoma? I should confirm that normal ALC does not exclude lymphoma, and that tissue diagnosis remains the gold standard when clinical suspicion is high. Persistent symptoms, lymphadenopathy, organomegaly, B symptoms, or imaging abnormalities justify biopsy irrespective of ALC, so I need to emphasize that ALC thresholds complement, but do not replace, clinical judgment and histopathology [^54f27d6f] [^2b4c610d].

A lymphocyte count **> 5 × 10⁹/L** [^71d82b88] is the key threshold for concern for lymphoma, specifically chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) [^cbea02fc], and warrants evaluation for a clonal B-cell disorder. For other lymphomas, **< 1.0 × 10⁹/L** (lymphopenia) is a poor prognostic sign [^dc25af28] and should prompt closer follow-up, but it is not diagnostic. Persistent lymphocytosis above 4.0–4.4 × 10⁹/L in adults, especially with atypical morphology or symptoms, should trigger flow cytometry [^64f2a2a6] and hematology referral [^notfound], while isolated mild elevations are often reactive and require clinical correlation [^816e2466].

## Lymphocyte count thresholds and lymphoma

Key thresholds for lymphocyte counts in lymphoma evaluation:

| **Lymphocyte count** | **Clinical significance** | **Recommended action** |
|-|-|-|
| > 5 × 10⁹/L | Diagnostic threshold for CLL/SLL [^71d82b88] | - Flow cytometry [^notfound] <br/> - Hematology referral [^notfound] |
| 4.0–4.4 × 10⁹/L | Threshold for evaluating clonal lymphocytosis in adults [^64f2a2a6] | - Smear review [^64f2a2a6] <br/> - Flow cytometry [^64f2a2a6] |
| < 1.0 × 10⁹/L (lymphopenia) | Poor prognostic factor in lymphomas [^dc25af28] | - Close follow-up [^notfound] <br/> - Evaluate for opportunistic infections [^e9bc354c] |

---

## Clinical context and morphology

- **Morphology**: Atypical lymphocytes (e.g. cleaved, folded nuclei) increase suspicion for lymphoma [^notfound].
- **Symptoms**: B symptoms (fever, night sweats, weight loss), lymphadenopathy, or organomegaly strengthen concern [^5a6d4a34].
- **Trends**: Persistent or rising lymphocytosis is more concerning than transient elevations [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

When lymphoma is suspected, the following steps are recommended:

- **Flow cytometry**: Detects clonal lymphocyte populations and immunophenotypes [^fcb3960d].
- **Peripheral smear**: Identifies atypical lymphocyte morphology [^fe19822e].
- **Imaging**: CT or PET-CT for lymphadenopathy or organ involvement [^d101dda8].
- **Bone marrow biopsy**: For CLL/SLL confirmation and staging [^notfound].
- **Molecular testing**: IGHV mutation status, FISH for cytogenetics in CLL/SLL [^notfound].

## Lymphopenia and prognosis

Lymphopenia (** < 1.0 × 10⁹/L**) is a poor prognostic factor in lymphomas, including DLBCL [^393e9f34] and Hodgkin lymphoma [^161e2e45], and reflects impaired host immunity [^dc25af28]; it warrants closer follow-up and infection risk assessment [^e9bc354c].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **> 5 × 10⁹/L**: Evaluate for CLL/SLL with flow cytometry and hematology referral [^71d82b88].
- **4.0–4.4 × 10⁹/L**: Consider flow cytometry, especially in older adults or with atypical cells [^64f2a2a6].
- **< 1.0 × 10⁹/L**: Recognize poor prognosis and monitor closely [^dc25af28].
- **Always interpret counts with symptoms, morphology, and trends** to guide next steps [^816e2466].

---

A lymphocyte count **> 5 × 10⁹/L** is the primary threshold for lymphoma concern, especially for CLL/SLL [^71d82b88], while **< 1.0 × 10⁹/L** signals poor prognosis and warrants closer follow-up [^dc25af28].

Epilogue

The dramatic increase in information regarding lymphoid tumours and their molecular complexity suggests that Fyodor Dostoyevsky's famous words, " Reality is infinitely diverse (… and) Reality resists classification " hold true for lymphoma classifications.

We are aware that any classification is arbitrary and subject to further evolution as new evidence arises. Moreover, since the development and differentiation of lymphocytes represent a continuous spectrum rather than a sequence of distinct steps, we acknowledge that any classification system breaks up a disease continuum into groups using arbitrary (and yet evidence-based) borders. Furthermore, our daily work demands the naming, and hence, the diagnosis, of discrete entities to allow for treatment decisions and for patient management. Therefore, following the principles of Linnaeus, classification also provides the basis for preserving knowledge and providing a template for future work.

We are grateful to - and stand on the shoulders of - countless individuals and research teams, who have contributed significantly to establish the foundations of the current lymphoma classification. We thank the numerous authors and contributors whose input and thoughts have created the herein outlined 'snapshot-in-time' of the classification. We are confident that the present proposal, albeit by definition imperfect, will provide a robust framework for future generations of scientists to continue our efforts, to further disentangle the universe of lymphoma biology, for the benefit of patient care.

There was consensus that all patients newly diagnosed with lymphoma should receive initial imaging via FDG-PET/CT. There was consensus that patients should be routinely screened for hepatitis B and C serologies, and patients with decreased neutrophil and absolute lymphocyte counts from CBC tests, as well as low levels of serum IgG. There was consensus that all patients with newly diagnosed lymphoma should receive assessment of their cardiovascular history and risk factors prior to receiving potentially cardiotoxic therapies (including some forms of radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapies). These patients should be examined and routinely monitored through methods such as transthoracic echocardiogram and ECG based on risk assessment.

### Lymphocytopenia as a prognostic marker for diffuse large B cell lymphomas [^4c0c64b9]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2008). Low credibility.

Lymphocytopenia has been reported to confer adverse outcomes in a number of hematological malignancies. Recently, it has been reported to be associated with poor outcome in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of lymphocytopenia at diagnosis in patients with DLBCL, and to confirm its significance as a prognostic factor, particularly in relation to the international prognostic index (IPI). Medical and laboratory records of 165 patients diagnosed with DLBCL were retrieved and analysed. Lymphocyte counts were correlated with overall survival and role as a prognostic marker independent of IPI was determined. Lymphocytopenia (lymphocyte count ≤ 1x10(9)/L) was noted in 35.8%; it correlated adversely with overall survival (3.4 years vs. 10.3 years, p = 0.002). A Cox regression model established that the prognostic significance was independent of the IPI.

### The classification of lymphomas: a new beginning or the end of an era? [^09dffb7a]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2003). Low credibility.

The World Health Organisation Classification of Tumours of the Haematopoietic and Lymphoid Tissues has recently been published. This is the latest in a long line of classifications of haematological malignancies and will be the international standard. It is now possible to achieve high levels of diagnostic accuracy for the main types of lymphoma. However, many of the entities encompass a wide spectrum of clinical outcomes and this approach to classification may be insufficiently precise for the future needs of haematological oncology. Rapid progress in targeted therapies may require further developments in tumour classification based on pathogenic features rather than arbitrary morphological criteria.

### T-cell lymphomas, version 2.2022, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^f6472d65]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2022). High credibility.

Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) response criteria — Complete remission requires disappearance of all disease with normal lymph nodes, extranodal masses, spleen, liver, skin, peripheral blood, and bone marrow, and each criterion must be present for at least 4 weeks; provided that < 5% of flower cells remain, complete remission is judged to have been attained if the absolute lymphocyte count, including flower cells, is < 4 × 10⁹/L. Uncertified complete remission is defined as a stable residual mass in a bulky lesion with ≥ 75% decrease in lymph nodes and extranodal masses and normal spleen, liver, skin, peripheral blood, and bone marrow. Partial remission requires regression of disease with ≥ 50% decrease in lymph nodes and extranodal masses, no increase in spleen and liver, ≥ 50% decrease in skin and peripheral blood, and bone marrow irrelevant. Stable disease is failure to attain complete/partial remission and no progressive disease, with no change in size across lymph nodes, extranodal masses, spleen, liver, and skin, and no change in peripheral blood and bone marrow. Relapsed disease or progressive disease is new or increased lesions with new or ≥ 50% increase in lymph nodes, extranodal masses, spleen and liver, ≥ 50% increase in skin, new or ≥ 50% increase in peripheral blood, and reappearance in bone marrow; where footnoted, ≥ 50% increase is defined by ≥ 50% increase from nadir in the sum of the products of measurable disease, and for peripheral blood by ≥ 50% increase from nadir in the count of flower cells and an absolute lymphocyte count, including flower cells, of > 4 × 10⁹/L. Decrease thresholds are calculated by the sum of the products of the greatest diameters of measurable disease. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### The derived neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio is an independent prognostic factor in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma [^5c026f60]. British Journal of Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Inflammation has been identified to be a critical component of tumour progression, highlighting the role of the microenvironment, which is largely orchestrated by inflammatory cells as an indispensable participant in the neoplastic process, fostering proliferation, survival and migration. For different solid tumours, as well as lymphomas, inflammation parameters, including leukocytes, neutrophils, lymphocytes and C-reactive protein, have been associated with higher mortality rates.

In addition to absolute counts of inflammation parameters, also the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) has been identified as an independent prognostic factor for OS and progression free survival (PFS) in various types of cancer, including renal cell carcinoma, colorectal cancer, sarcoma and pancreatic cancer. Recently, the NLR has been suggested to be a simple, inexpensive, standardized prognostic factor to assess clinical outcomes in DLBCL patients treated with R-CHOP. Frequently, the absolute lymphocyte count is not routinely documented in clinical trials despite determining a differential white cell count. To solve this problem, the derived neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (dNLR) was recently implemented, consisting of neutrophil count divided by (leukocyte count−neutrophil count). In this study by), they proposed a similar prognostic value of the dNLR compared with the NLR in different solid cancer types but not explicitly for DLBCL patients. However, for hematological malignancies, the dNLR has not been validated yet. In the present study, therefore, we evaluated for the first time the prognostic significance of baseline dNLR in a large cohort of 290 patients, diagnosed with DLBCL.

### AIDS-related Burkitt lymphoma in the United States: what do age and CD4 lymphocyte patterns tell us about etiology and / or biology? [^07a3906c]. Blood (2010). Low credibility.

Trimodal or bimodal age-specific incidence rates for Burkitt lymphoma (BL) were observed in the United States general population, but the role of immunosuppression could not be excluded. Incidence rates, rate ratios, and 95% confidence intervals for BL and other non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), by age and CD4 lymphocyte count categories, were estimated using Poisson regression models using data from the United States HIV/AIDS Cancer Match study (1980–2005). BL incidence was 22 cases per 100 000 person-years and 586 for non-BL NHL. Adjusted BL incidence rate ratio among males was 1.6× that among females and among non-Hispanic blacks, 0.4× that among non-Hispanic whites, but unrelated to HIV-transmission category. Non-BL NHL incidence increased from childhood to adulthood; in contrast, 2 age-specific incidence peaks during the pediatric and adult/geriatric years were observed for BL. Non-BL NHL incidence rose steadily with decreasing CD4 lymphocyte counts; in contrast, BL incidence was lowest among people with ≤ 50 CD4 lymphocytes/μL versus those with ≥ 250 CD4 lymphocytes/μL (incidence rate ratio 0.3 [95% confidence interval = 0.2–0.6]). The bimodal peaks for BL, in contrast to non-BL NHL, suggest effects of noncumulative risk factors at different ages. Underascertainment or biological reasons may account for BL deficit at low CD4 lymphocyte counts.

### Low absolute lymphocyte count is a poor prognostic factor in diffuse-large-B-cell-lymphoma [^393e9f34]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2008). Low credibility.

The prognostic value of absolute lymphocytic count (ALC), has been a recent matter of debate in non-Hodgkin-lymphoma (NHL). We assessed prospectively the value of ALC at diagnosis and also after the completion of immuno-chemotherapy in 101 diffuse-large-B-cell-lymphoma (DLBCL). Analysis of prognostic factors with respect to overall survival (OS), event free survival (EFS) and progression free survival (PFS) was done by two-tailed log-rank test. The ALC cut-off value was calculated as < 0.84 × 10⁹/L at diagnosis: this was a strong negative prognostic factor for OS (p = 0.0004), EFS (p < 0.00001) and PFS (p < 0.00001) and in multivariate analysis was independent from the revised-international-prognostic-index (R-IPI). ALC after chemo-immunotherapy was not of prognostic value. As R-IPI and ALC < 0.84 × 10⁹/L, were the factors better discriminating poor prognosis, a new trichotomous score (ALC/R-IPI) was built up: (1) low risk: R-IPI = very good or good and ALC < 0.84 × 10⁹/L; (2) intermediate risk: patients with at least one risk factor (R-IPI = poor or ALC < 0.84 × 10⁹/L). (3) high risk: patients with both risk factors. This new prognostic score was highly significant in univariate analysis for OS (p = 0.0002), EFS (p < 0.00001) and PFS (p < 0.00001). In multivariate analysis ALC/R-IPI was the most predictive factor for OS (OR = 2.954; p = 0.002) and EFS (OR = 2.381; p < 0.00001) and the only predictive factor for PFS (OR = 4.018; p < 0.00001). Our data, show that ALC at diagnosis has a strong prognostic relevance and is independent from the R-IPI. The new score including both values proved the most powerful predictor at multivariate analysis.

### Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) clinical practice guideline on immunotherapy for the treatment of lymphoma [^d101dda8]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

General recommendations

Participation in a clinical trial may be a consideration for any patient with lymphoma. Supporting this, a systematic review of patient outcomes determined that participation in a clinical trial, on average, does not result in worse health outcomes for patients. Because participation in clinical trials does not represent an inherent risk to patient health, participation in clinical trials may be recommended as a matter of routine practice, especially in cases where approved treatment options may be limited.

Initial imaging is an important step in staging lymphoma following diagnosis as well as for monitoring response to treatment. Evidence from a systematic review supports a combination of fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) and computed tomography (CT) as superior to either modality alone in terms of diagnostic performance.

Patients being treated for lymphoma may be at increased risk of infection as a consequence of immunosuppression, due to either their disease or immunosuppressive or cytotoxic therapies. For example, rituximab or anti-CD19 CAR T cell treatment may lead to hypogammaglobulinemia, and adoptive cell transfer therapies (eg, CAR T cell infusion) frequently necessitate lymphodepletion. Therefore, it is important to monitor patients for the development of both cytopenias and hypogammaglobulinemia during treatment for lymphoma.

A number of therapeutic agents used in the treatment of lymphoma have the potential to cause cardiotoxicity, including some types of immunotherapy, chemotherapy, particularly anthracycline-based regimens, and radiation. For this reason, a thorough baseline workup for cardiovascular function and regular testing of cardiac parameters is important for any patient undergoing lymphoma treatment.

Panel recommendations

There was consensus that clinical trials should be strongly considered as a treatment option at each stage of therapy for eligible patients with lymphoma.
There was consensus that all patients newly diagnosed with lymphoma should receive initial imaging via FDG-PET-CT.
There was consensus that patients should be routinely administered complete blood count (CBC) and serum IgG tests. Infection precautions may be considered in patients with decreased neutrophil and absolute lymphocyte counts from CBC tests, as well as low levels of serum IgG.
There was consensus that all patients with newly diagnosed lymphoma should receive assessment of their cardiovascular history and risk factors prior to receiving potentially cardiotoxic therapies (including some forms of radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapies). These patients should be examined and routinely monitored through methods such as transthoracic echocardiogram and ECG based on risk assessment.

### The absolute monocyte and lymphocyte prognostic score predicts survival and identifies high-risk patients in diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma [^e05ef59a]. Leukemia (2011). Low credibility.

Despite the use of modern immunochemotherapy regimens, almost 50% of patients with diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma will relapse. Current prognostic models, including the International Prognostic Index, incorporate patient and tumor characteristics. In contrast, recent observations show that variables related to host adaptive immunity and the tumor microenvironment are significant prognostic variables in non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Therefore, we retrospectively examined the absolute monocyte and lymphocyte counts as prognostic variables in a cohort of 366 diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma patients who were treated between 1993 and 2007 and followed at a single institution. The absolute monocyte and lymphocyte counts in univariate analysis predicted progression-free and overall survival when analyzed as continuous and dichotomized variables. On multivariate analysis performed with factors included in the IPI, the absolute monocyte and lymphocyte counts remained independent predictors of progression-free and overall survival. Therefore, the absolute monocyte and lymphocyte counts were combined to generate a prognostic score that identified patients with an especially poor overall survival. This prognostic score was independent of the IPI and added to its ability to identify high-risk patients.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: Hodgkin lymphoma, version 2.2022 [^08cfb119]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2022). High credibility.

Advanced classical Hodgkin lymphoma (stage III–IV) prognostic factors and International Prognostic Score (IPS) derive from an international collaborative effort evaluating > 5000 patients with advanced CHL (stage III–IV), each of which reduced survival rates by 7% to 8% per year: age ≥ 45 years, male gender, stage IV disease, albumin level < 4 g/dL, hemoglobin level < 10.5 g/dL, leukocytosis (white blood cell [WBC] count > 15,000/mm3), and lymphocytopenia (lymphocyte count < 8% of the WBC and/or lymphocyte count < 600/mm3). The International Prognostic Score (IPS) is defined by the number of adverse prognostic factors present at diagnosis and helps to determine the clinical management and predict prognosis for patients with stage III–IV disease.

### Idiopathic CD4 lymphocytopenia [^4b3303b1]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

A severe decrease of CD4 T cells predisposes humans to opportunistic infections. In adults, HIV is certainly the most common cause of CD4 lymphocytopenia, but other causes, such as infections, autoimmune diseases, immunosuppressive therapy, lymphoma and idiopathic forms need to be considered. This review summarizes the current knowledge of the poorly understood syndrome of idiopathic CD4 lymphocytopenia.

Recent Findings

Little research has tried to systematically dissect this probably heterogeneic syndrome after its initial description in 1992. Numerous cases presenting with opportunistic infections have been reported. Disturbed differentiation of stem cell precursors may contribute to CD4 lymphocytopenia. Because infections and lymphoma may also cause CD4 lymphocytopenia, the distinction between cause and effect may evolve only during follow-up.

Summary

The manifestation of opportunistic infections calls for the evaluation of the immune system for CD4 lymphocytopenia. The differential diagnosis of this condition in adults comprises primarily HIV infection and less often other diseases or drugs. Idiopathic CD4 lymphocytopenia is very rare. The clinical significance of low CD4 cell counts in HIV negative patients still awaits its systematic analysis. Prophylaxis of opportunistic infections is oriented at the recommendations of HIV-infected individuals and causal treatment remains experimental.

Response assessment in patients receiving agents that mobilize lymphoma cells from lymph nodes and bone marrow into the blood

Some agents can inhibit adhesion mechanisms in tumor cells causing redistribution of tumor cells from lymph nodes and/or bone marrow into the blood. Thus, while lymph node size decrease in response to therapy, the tumor cell count increases in the blood, creating another form of "pseudo-progression". With continued therapy, blood lymphocytosis decrease as tumor cells start to die. This phenomenon has been observed with BTK and PI3K inhibitors. Accordingly, increased lymphocytosis in the setting of a decrease in lymph node measurement is not considered PD, and response designation should depend on lymph nodes and extra-nodal disease measurement. Lymphocytosis can be included as annotation. For example, PR with increased lymphocytosis.

Appearance of a new extranodal lesion

With the use of PET imaging, a new small PET avid lesion may appear during or after therapy, but there are no guidelines on how to interpret such lesions to define PD. Ideally, such lesions should be biopsied where clinically feasible to clarify their nature, but frequently they are too small to biopsy. Eventually, with observation, the nature of such lesions is clarified. Pulmonary or skin infection and arthritis may result in false positive PET activity and may be confused with an early progression. A retrospective approach may not be appropriate as it creates confusions as patients' records and source documents will require corrections. On the other hand, a delayed declaration of PD may also create concerns of data integrity for regulatory oversight of clinical trials, especially when a drug is undergoing an approval process by a regulatory authority. Therefore, a uniform and transparent approach should be implemented.

Recommendation

A minimum of 1 cm in largest diameter of new extra-nodal lesions is required to assign PD directly. New smaller but suspicious lesion should be designated as equivocal, and if later confirmed (by CT or biopsy) as being due to lymphoma, the documented date of progression should be the date of when it was first identified as equivocal

Integrating target and nontarget lesions in the response assessment

In case of disseminated disease, the status of non-target lesions should be taken into account before formulating the final response status. A recommended approach is shown in Table 3.

### Lymphocytosis, lymphadenopathy: benign or malignant? [^816e2466]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2015). Low credibility.

The increasing use of immunophenotypic and molecular analysis in the routine evaluation of patients with lymphocytosis, lymphadenopathy, or other hematologic disorders has led to the identification of unexpected small clonal lymphoid populations. These clones, sometimes with disease-specific markers, such as the t(14;18), are especially challenging for the clinician because of their unknown biologic potential and uncertain clinical behavior. Study of these early lymphoid lesions is providing important clues to the process of lymphomagenesis, and may provide the rationale for preemptive therapy in the future. More and more, the hematologist/oncologist is consulted regarding otherwise healthy individuals with lymphadenopathy and/or lymphocytosis, and pathology reports that confound the referring internist or surgeon. The report does not name a malignant lymphoproliferative disorder, but is not completely "normal". Does the patient have a benign or malignant condition? How should they be evaluated? Is treatment indicated? These patients prove challenging for the consulting hematologist as well as the referring physician. In this review, we will focus on some of these scenarios and attempt to provide guidance for their management.

A regression equation and risk-scoring table (Table 4) were constructed to predict persistent SARS-CoV-2 infection based on significant risk factors:

Table 4
Risk scoring table

Notes

1 Lymphocyte Count: The coefficient is negative, indicating that a higher lymphocyte count is associated with lower risk. Therefore, when calculating the total score, if the lymphocyte count is above a certain threshold (which needs to be determined based on actual data), a negative score is given (i.e. subtract 1 point). If it is below the threshold, no score is given or a positive score is given based on specific circumstances (but in this table, for simplification, we assume that all patients' lymphocyte counts are below this threshold, so they all lose 1 point). However, in practical applications, a more refined approach may be to assign scores based on specific lymphocyte count values, such as dividing into several ranges, each corresponding to a different score

2 Other Risk Factors: For hypertension, immunosuppression, and lung lesions, if the patient has the risk factor, the corresponding score is given

Risk Score Calculation:

Add the scores for each risk factor the patient has, to obtain the total risk score

Note that since the score for lymphocyte count is negative, when calculating the total score, if the lymphocyte count is above the threshold, the negative score needs to be subtracted from the total score (i.e. add 1 point because negative times negative equals positive). But in this simplified table, we assume that all patients' lymphocyte counts result in them losing 1 point

Risk Level Classification

The higher the total score, the higher the risk of the patient developing persistent SARS-CoV-2 infection

Different thresholds can be set based on the total score to classify risk levels, such as:

### Assessment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and small lymphocytic lymphoma by absolute lymphocyte counts in 2, 126 patients: 20 years of experience at the university of Texas M.D. anderson cancer center… [^228e6561]. ASCO (2007). Low credibility.

Abstract Purpose Chronic lymphocytic leukemia and small lymphocytic lymphoma are currently considered the same entity, but controversy remains over whether CLL and SLL should be treated similarly. We assessed whether characteristics of patients with CLL and SLL differ in ways other than the absolute lymphocyte count and evaluated treatment outcomes and prognostic factors. Results Among 2, 126 consecutive CLL/SLL patients, 312 had ALC less than 5 × 10. 9/L. Patients with ALC less than 5 × 10 9/L had lower rates of cytogenetic abnormalities and higher rates of CD38-positive results and had mutated immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region gene status. Rates of response, survival, and failure-free survival were not different among ALC groups. Regimens that included rituximab and a nucleoside analog were associated with superior rates of response and FFS compared with other therapies, irrespective of ALC.

Deletion 17p or 6q with or without other cytogenetic abnormalities, age at least 60 years, β 2-microglobulin at least 2 mg/L, albumin less than 3. 5 g/dL, and creatinine at least

1. 6 mg/dL were each found to independently predict shorter survival and formed the basis of a scoring system. Conclusion Patients with CLL or SLL can be treated similarly. A new prognostic score is proposed.

### Peripheral blood lymphocyte / monocyte ratio at diagnosis and survival in classical Hodgkin's lymphoma [^012a7f64]. Haematologica (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Lymphopenia and tumor-associated macrophages are negative prognostic factors for survival in classical Hodgkin's lymphoma. We, therefore, studied whether the peripheral blood absolute lymphocyte count/absolute monocyte count ratio at diagnosis affects survival in classical Hodgkin's lymphoma.

Design and Methods

We studied 476 consecutive patients with classical Hodgkin's lymphoma followed at the Mayo Clinic from 1974 to 2010. Receiver operating characteristic curves and area under the curve were used to determine cut-off values for the absolute lymphocyte count/absolute monocyte count ratio at diagnosis, while proportional hazards models were used to compare survival based on the absolute lymphocyte count/absolute monocyte count ratio at diagnosis.

Results

The median follow-up period was 5.6 years (range, 0.1–33.7 years). An absolute lymphocyte count/absolute monocyte count ratio at diagnosis of 1.1 or more was the best cut-off value for survival with an area under the curve of 0.91 (95% confidence interval, 0.86 to 0.96), a sensitivity of 90% (95% confidence interval, 85% to 96%) and specificity of 79% (95% confidence interval, 73% to 88%). Absolute lymphocyte count/absolute monocyte count ratio at diagnosis was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (hazard ratio, 0.18; 95% confidence interval, 0.08 to 0.38, P < 0.0001); lymphoma-specific survival (hazard ratio, 0.10; 95% confidence interval, 0.04 to 0.25, P < 0.0001); progression-free survival (hazard ratio, 0.35; 95% confidence interval, 0.18 to 0.66, P < 0.002) and time to progression (hazard ratio, 0.27; 95% confidence interval, 0.17 to 0.57, P < 0.0006).

Conclusions

The ratio of absolute lymphocyte count/absolute monocyte count at diagnosis is an independent prognostic factor for survival and provides a single biomarker to predict clinical outcomes in patients with classical Hodgkin's lymphoma.

Impact of lymphopenia on tumor evolution

Lymphopenia is correlated with patient survival and toxicity of chemotherapy

Lymphopenia observed in advanced disease correlates with patients' performance status (PS) as well as with specific unfavorable prognostic factors.

Studies performed by our group and others, including over 3,000 patients with advanced cancers, have shown that regardless of the histological subtype and treatment, global and CD4 + lymphopenia are powerful independent predictors of risk of high grade toxicity associated with chemotherapy including febrile neutropenia (FN), severe thrombocytopenia requiring platelet transfusion, severe anemia requiring red blood cells (RBC) transfusion and increased risk of early death after chemotherapy.

Randomized clinical trials have demonstrated the ability of prophylactic recombinant G-CSF (Filgrastim, ELYPSE-2) and EPOα (ELYPSE-4) to reduce FN and RBC transfusion requirements, respectively in these high risk lymphopenic patients.

Prognostic Value of lymphopenia for PFS and OS

A peripheral lymphopenia impacts on patient PFS and OS in many advanced solid tumors (Table 1). In breast and ovarian carcinomas, NHL, DLBCL, T-cell lymphomas (PTCL, PTCLU), follicular lymphoma, sarcomas and colon carcinoma, a global (< 1000/mm 3) or severe (< 700/mm 3) lymphopenia detected before treatment, early after chemotherapy treatment (5 or 15 days) or after radiotherapy (RT) (for review :) is associated with a worse PFS and OS.

### Monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL): biology, natural history and clinical management [^0b0a13d2]. Leukemia (2010). Low credibility.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and the other low-grade non-Hodgkin lymphomas are among the most common lymphoid malignancies. Recent studies suggest that more than 4% of the general population over age 40 harbor a population of clonal B cells with the phenotype of either CLL or another B-cell malignancy, a condition now designated monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL). Although all cases of CLL appear to be preceded by MBL, the majority of individuals with MBL will not develop a hematologic malignancy. The biologic characteristics and clinical implications of MBL appear to differ based on whether it is identified during the diagnostic evaluation of lymphocytosis or incidentally discovered through screening of individuals with normal lymphocyte counts as part of research studies using highly sensitive detection methods. In this paper, we provide a state of the art review on the prevalence, nomenclature, biology, natural history and clinical management of MBL.

Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) response assessment defines complete response (CR) as disappearance of disease with an absolute lymphocyte count, including flower cells, < 4 × 10⁹/L in the peripheral blood; partial response (PR) requires ≥ 50% reduction in measurable disease, ≥ 50% reduction in skin involvement, and ≥ 50% reduction in absolute lymphocyte counts without new lesions or organ enlargement. Stable disease (SD) is failure to achieve CR or PR with no progressive disease (PD); PD includes new lesions or ≥ 50% increase in lymph node or extranodal disease, ≥ 50% increase in skin involvement, 50% increase from nadir in flower cells, or an increase in absolute lymphocyte count, including flower cells, of > 4 × 10⁹/L. Each criterion should be observed for a minimal period of 4 weeks to qualify, and an unconfirmed complete response (CRu) is defined as ≥ 75% reduction in tumor size with residual mass and an absolute lymphocyte count, including flower cells, of < 4 × 10⁹/L.

### Importance of early immune recovery after autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation in lymphoma patients [^7f25925f]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2019). Medium credibility.

Lymphomas constitute the second most common indication for autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (AHCT). Graft infusion is followed by a rapid hematological recovery and slower immune recovery. The number of natural killer cells and CD3 + T lymphocytes achieve normal counts usually within a month, whereas the recovery of CD3 + CD4 + T lymphocytes is much slower. Early immune recovery is usually defined as the absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) ≥ 0.5×10 9 /L, which has been associated with improved progression-free and even overall survival. Several factors have been associated with early immune recovery, including higher infused lymphocyte and CD34 + cell doses, both of which are affected by the choice of mobilization. This review summarizes the clinical importance of early immune recovery for long-term success of AHCT in lymphomas. Factors known to affect early immune recovery are discussed and suggestions made how to improve mobilization and collection processes to optimize immune recovery and post-transplant outcomes.

### The ratio of the absolute lymphocyte count to the absolute monocyte count is associated with prognosis in Hodgkin's lymphoma: correlation with tumor-associated macrophages [^4679c986]. The Oncologist (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Although most patients with classical Hodgkin's lymphoma (cHL) have a long survival duration, the current risk stratification is imperfect. A recent study suggested a prognostic role for the peripheral blood absolute lymphocyte count/absolute monocyte count (ALC/AMC) ratio at diagnosis in cHL. It is intriguing to investigate the significance of the ALC/AMC ratio in relation to tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), yet another prognostic factor for cHL.

Methods

We examined the prognostic impact of the ALC, AMC, and ALC/AMC ratio in 312 cHL patients (median age, 37 years) using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis for optimal cutoff values, and compared these with TAM content.

Results

The median follow-up was 65 months (range, 0.1–245 months). On univariate analysis, a low ALC/AMC ratio (< 2.9) was correlated with a poorer overall survival (OS) outcome. A subgroup analysis of patients with limited-stage disease showed that the ALC/AMC ratio was significantly correlated with the OS time. Multivariate analysis showed the ALC/AMC ratio to be an independent prognostic factor for OS outcome. A Spearman correlation test of TAM content showed a negative correlation with the ALC/AMC ratio and a positive correlation with the peripheral blood macrophage percentage.

Conclusions

This study suggests that the ALC/AMC ratio may be a simple, inexpensive, and independent prognostic factor for OS outcome in patients with cHL and may have a role in the stratification of cHL patients in addition to the International Prognostic Score and TAM content.

Leukocytosis is one of the most common laboratory abnormalities in medicine, and one of the most frequent reasons for hematologic consultation. Effective evaluation of leukocytosis requires an attentive history, careful physical examination, meticulous review of the complete blood count and peripheral blood smear, judicious application of laboratory and radiologic testing, and thoughtful analysis. Definitive diagnosis may require bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, imaging studies, and specialized molecular tests. The differential diagnosis of leukocytosis includes physiologic responses to a broad range of infectious and inflammatory processes, as well as numerous primary hematologic disorders such as leukemias, lymphomas, and myeloproliferative neoplasms.

### Laboratory workup of lymphoma in adults: guideline from the American Society for Clinical Pathology and the college of American pathologists [^bce463be]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Context —

The diagnostic workup of lymphoma continues to evolve rapidly as experience and discovery led to the addition of new clinicopathologic entities and techniques to differentiate them. The optimal clinically effective, efficient, and cost-effective approach to diagnosis that is safe for patients can be elusive, in both community-based and academic practice. Studies suggest that there is variation in practice in both settings.

Objective —

To develop an evidence-based guideline for the preanalytic phase of testing, focusing on specimen requirements for the diagnostic evaluation of lymphoma.

Design —

The American Society for Clinical Pathology, the College of American Pathologists, and the American Society of Hematology convened a panel of experts in the laboratory workup of lymphoma to develop evidence-based recommendations. The panel conducted a systematic review of literature to address key questions. Using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach, recommendations were derived based on the available evidence, strength of that evidence, and key judgements as defined in the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation Evidence to Decision framework.

Results —

Thirteen guideline statements were established to optimize specimen selection, ancillary diagnostic testing, and appropriate follow-up for safe and accurate diagnosis of indolent and aggressive lymphoma.

Conclusions —

Primary diagnosis and classification of lymphoma can be achieved with a variety of specimens. Application of the recommendations can guide decisions on specimen suitability, diagnostic capabilities, and correct use of ancillary testing. Disease prevalence in patient populations, availability of ancillary testing, and diagnostic goals should be incorporated into algorithms tailored to each practice environment.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) response definitions after treatment — Group A tumor load and Group B hematopoietic function define complete remission (CR), partial remission (PR), progressive disease (PD), and stable disease (SD). CR requires all criteria: no lymph nodes ≥ 1.5 cm in longest dimension; spleen size < 13 cm with liver size normal; no constitutional symptoms; normal circulating lymphocyte count; platelet count ≥ 100,000/μL; hemoglobin ≥ 11 g/dL (untransfused and without erythropoietin); normocellular marrow with no CLL cells and no B-lymphoid nodules; and neutrophils ≥ 1500/μL. PR requires at least 2 Group A and 1 Group B improvements if previously abnormal (with the stated single-parameter exception), with decreases ≥ 50% from baseline in nodes/organomegaly and circulating lymphocyte count, platelets ≥ 100,000/μL or increase ≥ 50% over baseline, hemoglobin ≥ 11 g/dL or increase ≥ 50% over baseline, and marrow that may show CLL cells or B-lymphoid nodules or be not done. PD is met by any one criterion from Groups A or B such as increases ≥ 50% from baseline or from response in nodes or liver/spleen, increase ≥ 50% over baseline in circulating lymphocyte count, platelet decrease ≥ 50% over baseline secondary to CLL, hemoglobin decrease of ≥ 2 g/dL from baseline secondary to CLL, or increase of marrow CLL cells by ≥ 50% on successive biopsies. SD reflects intermediate changes (e.g., change of −49% to +49% for tumor-burden measures, and for hemoglobin: Increase < 11.0 g/dL or < 50% over baseline, or decrease < 2 g/dL) and constitutional symptoms alone do not define PD.

### Low absolute peripheral blood CD4 + T-cell count predicts poor prognosis in R-CHOP-treated patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma [^d919881c]. Blood Cancer Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone (R-CHOP) therapy is indicated for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients regardless of the revised International Prognostic Index (IPI). Although the 3-year overall survival (OS) in the poor-risk group in revised IPI was 60%, it has been known that patients with DLBCL had more severe prognosis, suggesting a need for other useful prognostic markers at diagnosis. An absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) is known to be a strong prognostic factor in DLBCL that is the most common non-Hodgkin lymphoma type. A low ALC, and high absolute monocyte count (AMC) in peripheral blood before and after R-CHOP therapy can predict short-term survival in DLBCL, and a low ALC is also known to negatively affect survival, not in germinal center (GC)-type DLBCL but in non-GC-type according to Hans algorithm. Currently, tumor-specific CD4+ T cells are known to have a role in the immune response against cancer, because CD4+ T cells facilitate the activation of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells and the antitumor effects of CD8+ T cells are limited in the absence of CD4+ T cells. In addition, CD4+ T cells can also target cancer cells in the absence of CD8+ T cells. Abnormalities in the CD4+ T-cell compartment, including the Th1 and Th2 subsets and related cytokines, have been shown to affect the occurrence of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, demonstrating that CD4+ T cells exert the strongest immunological response against tumors. On the other hand, it is not known whether peripheral blood T-cell subsets interfere with the prognosis of DLBCL. Recently, the ACD4C was identified as a prognostic marker in indolent lymphomas. Even in DLBCL, ACD4C was suggested as a prognostic marker in patients with R-CHOP. To further investigate the relationships of the host immunity at diagnosis with survival of DLBCL patients after R-CHOP and with other prognostic factors of DLBCL are crucial factors for improving the standard therapy in DLBCL. Thus, we primarily investigated the relationships of the pretreatment absolute lymphocyte subset counts with survival and other prognostic factors in de novo DLBCL patients.

### Prognostic significance of the ratio of absolute neutrophil count to absolute lymphocyte count in classic Hodgkin lymphoma [^82eb9ee6]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2012). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to determine the prognostic effect of the absolute neutrophil count/absolute lymphocyte count ratio (ANC/ALC ratio) in patients with classic Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL). We performed a retrospective analysis of 312 patients with cHL. Univariate analysis revealed that a high ANC/ALC ratio (≥ 4.3) correlated with poor overall survival (OS) (P < .001). Subgroup analysis of advanced-stage disease showed that the ANC/ALC ratio was significant for OS (P = 0.032). Multivariate analysis revealed the ANC/ALC ratio to be an independent prognostic factor for OS (P = 0.048). The ANC/ALC ratio allowed further risk stratification in patients who were considered to be at low risk on the basis of an International Prognostic Score less than 4 (P = 0.002). The ANC/ALC ratio is a simple, inexpensive, and independent prognostic factor for OS that may improve the ability to identify high-risk patients with cHL.

### The relationship between absolute lymphocyte count with PFS in patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma undergoing autologous hematopoietic cell transplant [^2952c5e9]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2008). Low credibility.

Previous reports in Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) patients undergoing autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (AHCT) have demonstrated a significant association between the absolute lymphocyte count at day 15 (ALC-15) with survival. To evaluate this finding further, we analyzed 146 patients with relapsed/refractory HL who underwent AHCT to evaluate the relationship between lymphocyte counts at apheresis and at two time points (days 15 and 90) after AHCT with PFS. We found no association between the ALC-15 and the ALC-90 with PFS. We found lymphocyte counts at apheresis and disease sensitive to salvage chemotherapy were predictive of PFS. In conclusion, our study does provide some support for the theory that the immune system may be important in disease control but further and more detailed studies in this area are required.

### Lymphopenia predicts preclinical relapse in the routine follow-up of patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma [^5e73f7ba]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2015). Low credibility.

The absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) has been reported to predict relapse in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). We performed the present study to determine whether the ALC could identify preclinical relapse during routine follow-up. Among all 148 patients analyzed, 39 patients exhibited relapse. Patients without relapse had a higher ALC compared with those with proven relapse at the time of relapse as well as 1 and 3 months before relapse. Low ALC (< 950/μL) at 1 and 3 months before relapse had a positive predictive value of 74.2% and 69.0% and a negative predictive value of 86.3% and 84.0%, respectively, to predict relapse. Low ALC at both 1 and 3 months before relapse was significantly associated with relapse by univariate and multivariate analysis. Our data suggest the potential of lymphopenia to detect preclinical relapse in DLBCL. This may help to identify patients requiring salvage chemotherapy at the time of minimal disease rather than clinically overt relapse.

Table 1
Classification of peripheral blood involvement in patients with cutaneous T‐cell lymphoma (mycosis fungoides or Sézary syndrome)

In 2011, the ISCL, the US Cutaneous Lymphoma Consortium, and the Cutaneous Lymphoma Task Force (CLTF) of the EORTC published consensus guidelines for defining clinical endpoints. These recommended that, in clinical trials, an absolute count of CD4 + CD26 − cells (or CD4 + CD7 − in CD26 + patients) assessed using flow cytometry should be used to determine the level of blood involvement. Moreover, because the ISCL–EORTC 2007 classification of B2 was determined by absolute numbers of Sézary cells per µL (≥ 1000 per µL), it was suggested that B0 should be defined by an absolute count of < 250 per µL CD4 + CD26 − or CD4 + CD7 − T cells by flow cytometry, or < 250 per µL Sézary cells by manual cell count (this value allowing for a 15% upper limit of normal for CD4 + CD26 − or CD4 + CD7 − cells; loss of CD26 or CD7 can occur at lower levels in normal populations and benign dermatoses). These new flow cytometry‐based definitions were included in the most recent EORTC–CLTF recommendation for classifying blood involvement and response in MF and SS, which further highlight the need for objective and standardized measurements of lymphocyte counts using flow cytometry.

### Timing of autologous stem cell transplantation from last chemotherapy affects lymphocyte collection and survival in non-Hodgkin lymphoma [^f08c220f]. British Journal of Haematology (2006). Low credibility.

The infused autograft absolute lymphocyte count (A-ALC) is an independent prognostic factor for survival in non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) status after autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). An A-ALC is dependent on the preaphaeresis absolute lymphocyte count (PA-ALC) at the time of aphaeresis. The factors affecting PA-ALC, as a surrogate marker of the host immune status at the time of aphaeresis, remain unknown. This study evaluated the hypothesis that PA-ALC is directly dependent upon the time interval from last chemotherapy (TILC), as a marker of immune recovery time from the myelosuppressive effects of chemotherapy prior to proceeding with aphaeresis collection.

Measuring treatment response in cutaneous T‐cell lymphoma

To date, blood classifications used in published studies have varied. However, in MF and SS, use of standardized objective definitions of blood involvement is essential if we are to formulate comparable endpoints that will allow us to assess response to treatment in clinical trials and clearly evaluate therapeutic management in clinical practice. The EORTC–CLTF guidelines on clinical trial endpoints indicate that, in patients with MF or SS, an absolute CD4 + CD26 − T‐cell count obtained using flow cytometry is the most reasonable objective measure for quantifying blood involvement, and thereby blood response to treatment. Assessment of CD4 + CD7 − count is the suggested alternative in patients who are CD26 +. These recommendations were updated by the EORTC–CTLF in 2018 (Table 3). Notable changes to the 2011 recommendations are that movement between blood classes B0 and B1 should not be considered when assessing treatment response, and, in patients who are in B2, an increase in T‐cell count of ≥ 50% should be considered progressive disease, with no requirement for ≥ 5000 Sézary cells per µL.

### Prognostic relevance of the neutrophil / lymphocyte ratio in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: a systematic review and meta-analysis and dose-response evidence [^7a53f3c3]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2025). Medium credibility.

Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma exhibits substantial prognostic heterogeneity, and inflammatory biomarkers such as the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) may provide complementary risk information to established clinical scores. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis including 20 studies with 5,770 patients for overall survival (OS) and 3,612 for progression-free survival (PFS). Higher pretreatment NLR was associated with inferior OS (HR 1.47, 95% CI 1.20–1.80; I ² = 84%) and inferior PFS (HR 1.51, 95% CI 1.01–2.27; I ² = 0%). Regionally, the OS association was strongest in European cohorts (HR 2.01, 95% CI 1.5–2.5), followed by Latin-American studies (HR 1.63, 95% CI 1.2–2.1), and was not evident in Asian series (HR 1.13, 95% CI 0.8–1.5). Using a cutoff NLR ≥ 4 strengthened associations for both OS (HR 1.61, 95% CI 1.39–1.87; I ² = 15%) and PFS (HR 1.81, 95% CI 1.33–2.46; I ² = 51%), whereas lower cutoffs were not consistently prognostic. Sensitivity analyses modestly reduced heterogeneity without altering conclusions. Publication-bias tests (Egger's test; trim-and-fill) attenuated pooled effects (OS HR 1.06; PFS HR 1.14), supporting cautious interpretation. In individual-participant data from 1,137 patients treated mainly with R-CHOP (median follow-up 50 months), baseline NLR showed a nonlinear dose-response association with OS; risk increased 39% across NLR 2.0–5.9 (HR 1.39; c-index 0.589). Clinically, NLR is inexpensive, universally available, and may refine risk stratification alongside IPI/NCCN-IPI particularly in resource-limited settings. Prospective, region-specific validation and standardization of an operational threshold (e.g. NLR ≥ 4) should be prioritized to enable clinical adoption.

### Lymphopenia as a prognostic factor in patients with peripheral T-cell lymphoma, unspecified [^50a85651]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2010). Low credibility.

Peripheral T-cell lymphoma, unspecified (PTCLU) is the most common T-cell lymphoma variant. The molecular heterogeneity of PTCLU is reflected by a diverse clinical course. Several prognostic factors have been studied, but further refinement is needed. The aim of our study was to retrospectively evaluate the presence of lymphopenia, defined as a lymphocyte count of < 1000 cells/mm³, as a prognostic factor for survival in patients with PTCLU. Sixty-nine cases with a pathological diagnosis of PTCLU were included in our analysis. Lymphopenia was seen in 38% of the patients and was statistically associated with a worse response to chemotherapy. In univariate analysis, lymphopenia, IPI score > 2, and Prognostic Index for PTCLU (PIT) score > 2 were associated with a worse overall survival. In multivariate analysis, lymphopenia and a PIT score > 2 were the only independent poor prognostic factors, implying an important role of the patient's immune system in both response to therapy and survival.

### A prognostic model for patients with lymphoma and COVID-19: a multicentre cohort study [^736c395e]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In the present study, we evaluated the impact of COVID-19 on survival of Italian lymphoma patients. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest series of patients reported so far and has some unique characteristics that may impact clinical practice: (1) it includes a large prospective cohort (n = 619), (2) it has the longest follow-up to date, and (3) it includes both hospitalized and not-hospitalized patients. Overall, we could draw conclusions on a population with a wide age distribution, affected by lymphoid malignancies with variable disease status, and with several lymphoma histologies that were well represented. With the present study, we can conclusively say that fatality rate of hospitalized patients with lymphoma is high (33.4%), which was in line with smaller retrospective series from the literature on lymphoma patientsor on HM in general. Furthermore, we could establish for the first time the relatively low mortality rate (3.8%) of patients that were managed as outpatients. Our analysis confirmed that the demographic characteristics of the patients are of main importance in the COVID-19–and–cancer scenario. Male gender and advanced age (> 65 years old) by themselves conferred a significant higher risk of death to patients with lymphoma and COVID-19, with hazard ratios in the range of 2 and 3.5, respectively. When demographic characteristics were paired by platelet and lymphocyte count, we could build an easy-to-use prognostic model that identified patients with ∼50% probability of death in the initial 2 months after COVID-19 infection (Table 4; Figure 2). Our prognostic model successfully applied both to admitted and not-admitted patients. The detrimental role of lymphopenia in our model may be related to the impaired humoral and cell-mediated response, associated to the reduced seroconversion related to lymphopenia. Thrombocytopenia instead may be related to the degree of acute inflammation, when proinflammatory mediators are released, and systemic endothelial damage occurs. Of note, the reason for death was registered as a prerequisite in our database to avoid overestimation bias in the rate of death due to comorbidities or other reasons that were not COVID related. Indeed, 91% of the registered and computed deaths were reported as COVID related. We acknowledge that the performance of our model was not verified in independent series, although it was validated internally (Figure 2), and therefore we need to consider our findings as hypothesis-generating for future external validation. Overall, these findings may assist hematologists and national health commissions in their decision-making processes regarding preventive measures and treatment in this patient population. Vaccination has been shown to be not as effective in lymphoma patients as in the normal setting, making this population more vulnerable to COVID-19. A substantial subset of vaccinated lymphoma patients may be at high risk of breakthrough COVID-19 infection. Adapted vaccination schedules for lymphoma patients, especially when exposed to anti-CD20–including regimens, are urgently needed, as this highlights the need for continuous, careful monitoring of this frail population.

### Kinetics of blood neutrophil and lymphocyte count in critically ill neutropenic patients with hematological malignancies [^87410ad3]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

In critically ill patients with hematological malignancies (HM), neutropenia and lymphopenia often coexist, whether related to HM or critical illness immunoparalysis. Both cytopenias expose patients to increased risk of infection and possibly mortality. However, little is known about the kinetics of neutrophil and lymphocyte count in neutropenic patients, which might affect the risk of serious infections in this vulnerable population.

We aimed to describe the course of blood neutrophil and lymphocyte count over time in adult patients with HM admitted to the ICU with severe neutropenia (neutrophil count ≤ 0.5 × 10 9 /L within 24 h of ICU admission) between 2008 and 2018.

All neutrophil and lymphocyte counts during hospital admission were collected along with demographics, underlying HM, main laboratory values on ICU admission, vital organ support in ICU and hospital mortality.

We included 210 patients (59% males, median age 61 [IQR 47–67] years), mostly with acute leukemias (66%) and lymphomas (22%) (Table 1). Vasopressors, invasive mechanical ventilation and renal replacement therapy were required in 44%, 42% and 8% of patients, respectively. Hospital mortality was 40%.

Table 1
Patients' main characteristics

Results are presented as median (interquartile range) and number (percentage) for continuous and categorical variables, respectively

Figure 1 a displays the course of blood neutrophil and lymphocyte counts over time: The mean neutrophil count sharply decreased to reach its nadir (mean ± SEM 0.19 ± 0.17 × 10 9 /L) on ICU admission with subsequent re-increase. The duration of severe neutropenia was 6 (3–12) days for survivors. By contrast, the lymphocyte count followed a flat curve with mean values consistently ≤ 0.5 × 10 9 /L throughout admission. The mean ± SEM lymphocyte count on ICU admission was 0.35 ± 0.02 × 10 9 /L. Severe lymphopenia (≤ 0.5 × 10 9 /L) was present on ICU admission in 137 patients, and its duration was 10 (4–17) days for survivors. Severe lymphopenia persisted for more than 3 and 7 days in 157 (75%) and 109 (52%) patients, respectively.

### A prognostic model for patients with lymphoma and COVID-19: a multicentre cohort study [^d58da734]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Lymphoma represents a heterogeneous hematological malignancy (HM), which is characterized by severe immunosuppression. Patients diagnosed of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) during the course of HM have been described to have poor outcome, with only few reports specifically addressing lymphoma patients. Here, we investigated the clinical behavior and clinical parameters of a large multicenter cohort of adult patients with different lymphoma subtypes, with the aim of identifying predictors of death. The study included 856 patients, of whom 619 were enrolled prospectively in a 1-year frame and were followed-up for a median of 66 days (range 1–395). Patients were managed as outpatient (not-admitted cohort, n = 388) or required hospitalization (n = 468), and median age was 63 years (range 19–94). Overall, the 30- and 100-days mortality was 13% (95% confidence interval (CI), 11% to 15%) and 23% (95% CI, 20% to 27%), respectively. Antilymphoma treatment, including anti-CD20 containing regimens, did not impact survival. Patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma had the more favorable survival, but this was partly related to significantly younger age. The time interval between lymphoma diagnosis and COVID-19 was inversely related to mortality. Multivariable analysis recognized 4 easy-to-use factors (age, gender, lymphocyte, and platelet count) that were associated with risk of death, both in the admitted and in the not-admitted cohort (HR 3.79 and 8.85 for the intermediate- and high-risk group, respectively). Overall, our study shows that patients should not be deprived of the best available treatment of their underlying disease and indicates which patients are at higher risk of death. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04352556.

### Chronic lymphocytic leukemia / small lymphocytic lymphoma, version 2.2024, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^cbea02fc]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma — overview and epidemiology: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) are characterized by progressive accumulation of leukemic cells in the peripheral blood, bone marrow, and lymphoid tissues, and morphologically these leukemic cells appear as small, mature lymphocytes that may be admixed with occasional larger or atypical cells or prolymphocytes. CLL remains the most prevalent adult leukemia in Western countries, and in 2025, an estimated 23,690 people will be diagnosed with CLL in the United States, and an estimated 4460 people will die from the disease. CLL and SLL are essentially different manifestations of the same disease that are similarly managed, with the major difference that in CLL abnormal lymphocytes are found circulating in blood in addition to being resident in bone marrow and lymphoid tissue, while in SLL the bulk of disease is in lymph nodes, bone marrow, and other lymphoid tissues and there are few (if any) abnormal lymphocytes circulating in blood.

### Enhancement of the follicular lymphoma international prognostic index (FLIPI) with lymphopenia (FLIPI-L): a predictor for overall survival and histologic transformation [^86bbc0c8]. Blood Cancer Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Dear Editor,

Follicular lymphoma (FL) accounts for one-third of adult non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHLs) in the Western hemisphere. Treatment, including observation, chemoimmunotherapy, surgery, or radiation, is guided by several prognostic indices.

The original Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (FLIPI) was created from five clinicobiological features and defines low (0–1), intermediate (2), and high (3–5) risk groups with 5-year overall survival (OS) of 91%, 78%, and 53%, respectively. Other prognostic indices have been modified FLIPI, adding cardiovascular diseaseor β2-microglobulin and bone marrow involvement in PRIMA-PI. Finally, molecular models (m7-FLIPI) use mutational status based on next-generation sequencing of seven genes.

Absolute lymphopenia has prognostic consequence in several hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. The impact of lymphopenia in diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) suggests enhanced risk stratification in FL, given the intertwined carcinogenesis and potential for transformation. Prior studies have demonstrated that lymphopenia was associated with worsened OS in FL. Therefore, we hypothesized that lymphopenia may be integrated with existing FLIPI to better stratify long-term survival outcomes and predict for transformation.

After institutional review board approval/informed consent waiver, patients at our institution diagnosed with FL between January 1999 and April 2016 were retrospectively reviewed. Clinicopathologic characteristics and absolute lymphocyte count was abstracted from the medical record. Absolute lymphopenia was defined as < 1.0 × 10 9 /L. Transformation to high-grade DLBCL, the presence of double hit confirmed with myc fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), and the presence of double expressor phenotype (> 40% myc overexpression on immunohistochemistry (IHC)) were documented.

Therapeutic outcomes according to the ALC, ACD8C, AMC and ACD4C

The overall response rate was higher in patients with high ALCs than those with low ALCs. The overall response rate was 96% in the high ALC group versus 84% in the low ALC group (P < 0.001), 97% in the high ACD4C group versus 74% in the low ACD4C group (P < 0.00000001) and 94% in the high ACD8C versus 72% in the low ACD8C (P < 0.00001), whereas the overall response rate was not dependent on AMC (91% in the low AMC group versus 86% in the high AMC group, P = 0.18). Similar trends were observed in the achievement of the complete response rate for the ALC (90% in the high ALC group versus 82% in the low ALC group, P = 0.04) and ACD4C (92% in the high ACD4C group versus 73% in the low ACD4C group, P < 0.0001), and ACD8C (89% in the high ACD8C group versus 72% in the low ACD8C group, P < 0.001), whereas the complete response rate was not dependent on AMC (87% in the low AMC group versus 82% in the high ACD8C group, P = 0.23). The estimated PFS and OS rates were significantly different between high and low lymphocyte subsets. Kaplan–Meier analyses yielded the 5-year PFS rates of 76.5% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 68.0–82.9) and 57.8% (95% CI = 49.3–65.5) in the high and low ALC groups (P < 0.0001), 73.7% (95% CI = 66.7–79.5) and 50.3% (95% CI = 39.0–60.6) in the high and low ACD4C groups (Figure 2a, P < 0.00001), 71.0% (95% CI = 64.5–76.6) and 46.1% (95% CI = 31.3–59.7) in the high and low ACD8C groups (P < 0.00001), and 56.9% (95% CI = 63.0–76.0) and 70.1% (95% CI = 45.2–67.0) in the high and low AMC groups (P = 0.01), respectively. Furthermore, the 5-year OS rates were 85.8% (95% CI = 78.4–90.8) and 67.1% (95% CI = 58.9–74.1) in the high and low ALC groups (P < 0.0001), 83.3% (95% CI = 77.1–88.0) and 59.0% (95% CI = 47.9–68.5) in the high and low ACD4C groups (Figure 2b, P < 0.00000001), 80.2% (95% CI = 74.4–84.8) and 55.6% (95% CI = 40.1–68.7) in the high and low ACD8C groups (P < 0.00001), and 68.8% (95% CI = 72.0–83.5) and 78.4% (95% CI = 57.4–77.7) in the high and low AMC groups (P = 0.07), respectively.

### Infused peripheral blood autograft absolute lymphocyte count correlates with day 15 absolute lymphocyte count and clinical outcome after autologous peripheral hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma [^9eaf9351]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2004). Low credibility.

Absolute lymphocyte count at day 15 (ALC-15) after autologous peripheral blood hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (APHSCT) is an independent prognostic factor for survival in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Factors affecting ALC-15 remain unknown. We hypothesized that dose of infused autograft lymphocytes (A-ALC) directly impacts upon ALC-15. A total of 190 consecutive NHL patients received A-ALC between 1993 and 2001. The primary end point was correlation between A-ALC and ALC-15. A strong correlation was identified (r = 0.71). A higher A-ALC was infused into patients achieving an ALC-15 ≥ 500/microl vs ALC-15 < 500/microl (median of 0.68 x 10(9)/kg (0.04–2.21 x 10(9)/kg), vs 0.34 x 10(9)/kg (0.04–1.42 x 10(9)/kg), P < 0.0001). The median follow-up for all patients was 36 months (maximum of 109 months). The A-ALC threshold was determined at 0.5 x 10(9)/kg. The median overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) times were longer in patients who received an A-ALC ≥ 0.5 x 10(9)/kg vs A-ALC < 0.5 x 10(9)/kg (76 vs 17 months, P < 0.0001; 49 vs 10 months, P < 0.0001, respectively). Multivariate analysis demonstrated A-ALC to be an independent prognostic indicator for OS and PFS. These data support our hypothesis that ALC-15 and survival are dependent upon the dose of infused A-ALC in NHL.

### Prognostic roles of absolute monocyte and absolute lymphocyte counts in patients with advanced-stage follicular lymphoma in the rituximab era: an analysis from the FOLL05 trial of the fondazione italiana linfomi [^d011cbdd]. British Journal of Haematology (2015). Low credibility.

Recently, in an attempt to improve the discrimination power of the international prognostic index (IPI), patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma were evaluated to determine the prognostic roles of peripheral blood absolute monocyte count (AMC) and absolute lymphocyte count (ALC). Here, we analysed data of 428 patients with follicular lymphoma (FL) enrolled in a prospective, randomized trial (FOLL05 study) conducted by Fondazione Italiana Linfomi, to assess the impact of AMC and ALC on progression-free survival (PFS). All patients had been treated with one of three treatment combinations: (i) rituximab (R) plus cyclophosphamide, vincristine and prednisone; (ii) R plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone or (iii) R plus mitoxantrone and fludarabine. We showed that only AMC was a powerful predictor of PFS, and possibly overall survival, in patients with FL treated with combination chemotherapy regimens that contained R. The AMC can be used alone as a novel, simple factor that can predict survival outcome in patients with FL, independent of the immunochemotherapy regimen. It may therefore be widely used by clinicians, due to its simplicity and broad applicability. Additionally, it can be combined with other factors that determine the IPI or FLIPI, to increase the discriminating ability of these indices.

Indications to start treatment in CLL/SLL include symptoms and disease progression, while isolated ALC elevation is insufficient. Indications include severe fatigue, weight loss, night sweats, fever without infection, threatened end-organ function, progressive bulky disease (enlarged spleen or lymph nodes), progressive anemia or thrombocytopenia, or steroid-refractory autoimmune cytopenia; ALC alone is not an indication in the absence of leukostasis, which is rarely seen in CLL.

### Absolute monocyte count at diagnosis could improve the prognostic role of early FDG-PET in classical Hodgkin lymphoma patients [^2825a952]. British Journal of Haematology (2018). Low credibility.

Recently published international guidelines suggested that positron emission tomography (PET)‐computed tomography (CT) could be utilized for response assessment using the Deauville criteria in fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)‐avid lymphomas (Meignan et al, 2012). Interim PET (I‐PET) scanning seems highly predictive of treatment failure in Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL) patients.

We recently showed that the absolute monocyte count (AMC) has prognostic value in patients with classical HL (cHL) (Tadmor et al, 2015). Here, we show that the combined use of I‐PET and AMC at diagnosis enables a more accurate projection of patient outcome in cHL.

The present study is an ancillary branch of the analysis reported by Tadmor et al, (2015). Patients with histopathological diagnosis of cHL previously enrolled in the Gruppo Italiano Studio Linfomi trials were eligible if data on all clinical and laboratory features and treatments, reported I‐PET results, treatment response and follow‐up were available. Response was defined according to the revised International Working Group guidelines (Cheson et al, 1999). An absolute lymphocyte count < 0·6 × 10 9 /l and AMC > 0·75 × 10 9 /l were used as cut‐off points. I‐PET was performed after 2 cycles of treatment. A positive or negative I‐PET was defined by the local investigators' interpretation of the nuclear physician's scan report, which was based on a visual qualitative assessment.

Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) subtypes — smoldering and chronic: The Lymphoma Study Group of the Japan Clinical Oncology Group (JCOG) has classified ATLL into four subtypes (smoldering, chronic, acute, or lymphoma). The smoldering (10%) and chronic (10%) subtypes are considered indolent, usually characterized by ≥ 5% abnormal T-lymphocytes in the peripheral blood, and may have skin or pulmonary lesions (but no ascites or pleural effusion). For smoldering disease, associated features include a normal lymphocyte count, normal serum calcium level, LDH levels within 1.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN), and no involvement of the liver, spleen, central nervous system (CNS), bone, or gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The chronic subtype is characterized by absolute lymphocytosis (≥ 4 ×10^9/L) with T lymphocytes ≥ 3.5 × 10^9/L, normal calcium level, LDH levels within two times the ULN, and no involvement of CNS, bone, or GI tract; lymphadenopathy and involvement of liver and spleen may be present.

### Peripheral blood lymphocyte / monocyte ratio at diagnosis and survival in nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma [^b40cea8a]. British Journal of Haematology (2012). Low credibility.

The pathological background in nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (NLPHL) consists of lymphocytes and histocytes. This study analysed the peripheral blood absolute lymphocyte count/absolute monocyte count ratio at diagnosis (ALC/AMC-DX) on the impact of survival in NLPHL. One hundred and three consecutive NLPHL patients that were followed at Mayo Clinic from 1974 to 2010 were included in the study. Receiver operating characteristic and area under the curve were used for ALC/AMC-DX cut-off value analysis and proportional-hazards models were used to compare survival based on the ALC/AMC-DX ratio. With a median follow-up of 8·9 years (range: 0·3–31 years), an ALC/AMC-DX ≥ 2·1 was the best cut-off value for survival with an area under the curve of 0·82, a sensitivity of 70% and specificity of 84%. After adjusting for the International Prognostic Score (IPS), ALC/AMC-DX remained an independent prognostic factor for overall survival [Hazard Ratio (HR), 0·33, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0·15–0·71%, P < 0·004]; lymphoma-specific survival (HR, 0·05; 95%CI, 0·01–0·68%, P < 0·002); progression-free survival (HR, 0·30; 95%CI, 0·14–0·60%, P < 0·006), and time to progression (HR, 0·06, 95%CI, 0·04–0·30%, P < 0·004). ALC/AMC-DX is a low cost, already standarized, biomarker to predict clinical outcomes in NLPHL.

### Prognostic value of lymphocyte / monocyte ratio in advanced Hodgkin lymphoma: correlation with international prognostic score and tumor associated macrophages [^3600b888]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2016). Low credibility.

We studied the prognostic significance of the absolute lymphocyte/monocyte count ratio (ALC/AMC), its contribution to the prognostic value of the International Prognostic Score (IPS), and evaluated if ALC/AMC could serve as a proxy for the frequency of CD68+tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in 101 patients with advanced Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve identified best cut-off values of 2.0 for ALC/AMC and 25% for CD68+TAM. Patients with ALC/AMC < 2, IPS > 2 and > 25% CD68+TAM had an inferior overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS). Spearman's test also uncovered a significant correlation between the ALC/AMC and TAM. Multivariate analysis identified ALC/AMC < 2, IPS > 2 and > 25% CD68+TAM as poor prognostic factors of OS and EFS. After evaluating ALC/AMC and IPS, we stratified patients into three progressively-worse-outcome groups (low-risk: 0 risk factors; intermediate: 1 risk factor; high: 2 risk factors). Our study encourages the combination of ALC/AMC with IPS, for refining risk prediction in advanced HL patients.

When to Initiate Treatment

In addition to diagnostic criteria, the iwCLL guidelines dictate when to initiate treatment, based on patients' symptoms, full blood counts and physical examination. The presence of constitutional symptoms, progressive lymphocytosis, a doubling time of less than 6 months, an Hb of less than 100 g/L or a platelet count of less than 100 x 10 9 /L as well as progressive or symptomatic bulky lymphadenopathy/organomegaly or treatment-resistant autoimmune thrombocytopaenia or anaemia are indications to start treatment. In some circumstances, treatment may be initiated at diagnosis, but it is much more common for patient to be monitored for signs of increasing disease activity often over many years.

### Establishing absolute lymphocyte count thresholds for further review of peripheral blood lymphocytosis to judiciously screen for monoclonal B-cell populations in older adults [^64f2a2a6]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Lymphocytosis may represent either a lymphoproliferative disorder (LPD) or a reactive process. The absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) threshold for further evaluation of lymphocytosis is not well established.

Methods

We prospectively performed flow cytometry on blood samples from patients 50 years or older with ALCs of 4.0 × 109 cells/L or greater without a history of an LPD.

Results

Monoclonal B-cell populations were found in 34 (19.1%) of 178 cases, with incidence increasing with age. In patients younger than 75 years, no monoclonal B-cell population was identified in patients with ALCs less than 4.4 × 109 cells/L, while such clones were found below and above this threshold in patients 75 years and older.

Conclusions

These findings support a threshold for smear review and flow cytometry no lower than 4.4 × 109 cells/L in patients younger than 75 years and a threshold as low as 4.0 × 109 cells/L in patients 75 years and older.

### Predictive significance of absolute lymphocyte count and morphology in adults with a new onset peripheral blood lymphocytosis [^fe19822e]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2014). Low credibility.

Aims

Lymphocytosis is commonly encountered in the haematology laboratory. Evaluation of blood films is an important screening tool for differentiating between reactive and malignant processes. The optimal lymphocyte number to trigger morphological evaluation of the smear has not been well defined in the literature. Likewise, the significance of lymphocyte morphology has not been well studied and there are no consensus guidelines or follow-up recommendations available. We attempt to evaluate the significance of lymphocyte morphology and to define the best possible cut-off value of absolute lymphocyte count for morphology review.

Methods

71 adult patients with newly detected lymphocytosis of 5.0×10(9)/L or more were categorised to either a reactive process or a lymphoproliferative disorder. We performed statistical analysis and morphology review to compare the difference in age, gender, lymphocyte count and morphological features between the two groups. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed to determine an optimal lymphocyte number to trigger morphology review.

Results

Lymphoproliferative disorders are associated with advanced age and higher lymphocyte count. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy of lymphocyte morphology as a screening test were 0.9, 0.59, 0.60, 0.58 and 0.71, respectively. The optimal cut-off of lymphocyte number for morphology review was found to be close to 7×10(9)/L.

Conclusions

We found a moderate interobserver agreement for the morphological assessment. 'Reactive' morphology was very predictive of a reactive process, but 'malignant' morphology was a poor predictor of a lymphoproliferative disorder.

### Monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis: definitions and natural history [^19b342cc]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2009). Low credibility.

The diagnostic term monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL) is used to characterise individuals with a circulating population of clonal B-cells, a total B-cell count of < 5 x 10(9)/L, and no other features of a B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder. The clinical implications of MBL may differ depending on whether an individual with a normal lymphocyte count is identified via a screening assay (screening MBL) or identified through clinical evaluation of lymphocytosis (clinical MBL). The B-cell count used to distinguish between clinical MBL (< 5 x 10(9)/L) and CLL (≥ 5 x 10(9)/L) was selected largely based on tradition and technological advances and it is unknown whether the natural history of 'clinical MBL' differs from that of patients with Rai stage 0 CLL. Since, a diagnosis of 'leukemia' may lead to profound psychologic distress for patients, we believe the diagnosis of CLL should be based on an individual's risk of developing symptoms, requiring chemotherapeutic treatment and/or dying of disease. Additional studies are needed to determine whether the clinical outcome of patients with MBL differs from that of patients with Rai stage 0 CLL and to identify what B-cell threshold optimally distinguishes between these conditions.

### CD19-positive lymphocyte count is critical for acquisition of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG after vaccination in B-cell lymphoma [^a992a81b]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

We then further analyzed the lymphoid group, which had a particularly lower antibody acquisition rate after vaccination than other groups. In patients with lymphoid malignancies (47 with B-cell lymphoid [BCL] malignancies and 4 with T-cell lymphoid malignancies) undergoing immunotherapy and/or chemotherapy (under treatment or within 3 months after the last administration of therapeutics), a positive antibody titer was not observed in any of the cases, except for 1 patient with T-cell lymphoma (Figure 1A; supplemental Table 2). Next, we examined the relationship between duration since the last administration and acquired antibody titers in patients with BCL who received anti-CD20 antibody therapeutics (n = 82; Figure 1B). Patients who were within 10 months of the last dose of anti-CD20 antibody therapeutics tended to have more difficulty in acquiring antibodies than those with an interval of more than 10 months, which was consistent with previous reports. In addition, in our cohort, 37.8% of the patients beyond 12 months after antibody treatment (n = 37) did not mount an antibody response after vaccination (Figure 1B). Based on these results, the factors involved in antibody response after vaccination among patients treated with anti-CD20 antibodies were examined in detail, focusing on blood cell counts, including lymphocyte subsets, and globulin levels at the time of vaccination (supplemental Figure 2; supplemental Table 4). The results showed that the number of CD19 + and CD4 + cells in the peripheral blood and serum IgM titer correlated significantly with the acquired antibody titer. These trends were also seen in patients with hematologic diseases overall, but were particularly pronounced in patients treated with anti-CD20 antibody therapeutics (supplemental Table 4). Using receiver operating characteristic analyses, we calculated the cutoff values as a CD19 + cell count of 20 cells per microliter, CD4 + cell count of 320 cells per microliter, and serum IgM level of 20 mg/dL (supplemental Figure 3). With these criteria, CD19-positive cell counts in peripheral blood showed the strongest correlation with increased anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG titers (r = 0.844; P < .001), with 0% antibody gain at a titer of < 20 per microliter and 76.7% gain at > 20 per microliter (Figure 1C). In addition, CD4 + cell counts of more than 320 cells per microliter and IgM levels of more than 20 mg/dL also significantly correlated with increased antibody titers (Figure 1D-E, supplemental Figure 4), although the correlation coefficient was lower than that of CD19 + cell count.

### Chronic lymphocytic leukemia / small lymphocytic lymphoma, version 2.2024, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^15cacf1e]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) — overview and epidemiology states that CLL and SLL are characterized by progressive accumulation of leukemic cells in the peripheral blood, bone marrow, and lymphoid tissues, with cells morphologically appearing as small, mature lymphocytes admixed with occasional larger or atypical cells, or prolymphocytes. CLL remains the most prevalent adult leukemia in Western countries, and in 2025, an estimated 23,690 people will be diagnosed with CLL in the United States, and an estimated 4460 people will die from the disease. CLL and SLL are essentially different manifestations of the same disease that are similarly managed, with the major difference that in CLL a significant number of abnormal lymphocytes are found circulating in blood in addition to being resident in bone marrow and lymphoid tissue, whereas in SLL the bulk of disease is in lymph nodes, bone marrow, and other lymphoid tissues and there are few (if any) abnormal lymphocytes circulating in blood.

Response criteria (iwCLL) for chronic lymphocytic leukemia — In clinical practice, response assessment involves both physical examination and evaluation of blood parameters, and treatment with cBTKi and noncovalent (reversible) BTKi and PI3Ki causes mobilization of lymphocytes into blood early during treatment initiation, resulting in a transient lymphocytosis in most patients, which does not signify disease progression. The revised iwCLL response criteria allow for the response category, partial response (PR) with lymphocytosis (PR-L), for patients receiving BTKi or PI3Ki, defined as clinical response with reduction in lymph nodes and splenomegaly with persistent lymphocytosis in the absence of other indicators of progressive disease; isolated progressive lymphocytosis in the setting of reduced lymph node size or organomegaly or improvement in hemoglobin/platelets will not be considered progressive disease.

American Society for Clinical Pathology and College of American Pathologists guideline — laboratory workup of lymphoma in adults aims to develop an evidence-based guideline for the preanalytic phase of testing, focusing on specimen requirements for the diagnostic evaluation of lymphoma. Using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, recommendations were derived based on the available evidence, the strength of that evidence, and key judgments as defined in the GRADE Evidence to Decision framework. Thirteen guideline statements were established to optimize specimen selection, ancillary diagnostic testing, and appropriate follow-up for safe and accurate diagnosis of indolent and aggressive lymphoma, and the conclusions state that primary diagnosis and classification of lymphoma can be achieved with a variety of specimens and that application of the recommendations can guide decisions about specimen suitability, diagnostic capabilities, and correct utilization of ancillary testing, while disease prevalence in patient populations, availability of ancillary testing, and diagnostic goals should be incorporated into algorithms tailored to each practice environment.

### Prognostic value of peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets in children and adolescents with high-grade mature B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma: a real-world outcomes study [^112c5921]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Little progress has been made in determining prognostic factors for patients with high-grade mature B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (HG B-NHL). Based on the important role of lymphocytes in cancer progression, this study aimed to explore the effect of peripheral blood lymphocytes on the prognosis of pediatric HG B-NHL.

Methods

Patients aged less than 18 years with newly diagnosed HG B-NHL were enrolled. Peripheral blood lymphocyte subset levels were detected at diagnosis, and their optimal cutoff values were determined according to event-free survival (EFS).

Results

In total, 206 patients were enrolled. The 5-year EFS and overall survival (OS) rates of the whole group were 92.1% ± 1.9% and 96.6% ± 1.3%, respectively. The 5-year EFS rate was worse in patients with a low relative CD4 + T-cell count (87.2% vs. 97.0%, p = 0.008), high relative CD8 + T-cell count (79.1% vs. 93.4%, p = 0.03), low CD4/CD8 ratio (80.5% vs. 94.2%, p = 0.01), and low B-cell count (80.0% vs. 93.4%, p = 0.02) at diagnosis than their counterparts. Cox multivariate analysis identified low relative CD4 + T-cell (HR = 4.91) and B-cell (HR = 3.87) counts at diagnosis as independent adverse prognostic factors. Patients with simultaneously low levels of CD4 + T and B cells had the worst outcomes in the entire cohort, with a 5-year EFS rate of 60.0%.

Conclusion

Low relative CD4 + T-cell and B-cell counts at diagnosis are associated with poor prognosis in children and adolescents with HG B-NHL in the real world.
