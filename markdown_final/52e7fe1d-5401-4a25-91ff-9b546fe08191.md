## Question

Can DKA cause elevated troponins?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) can cause elevated cardiac troponins and how to interpret that clinically. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the frequency and magnitude of troponin elevations reported in DKA cohorts. Then, I should verify the proposed pathophysiologic mechanisms that could plausibly injure the myocardium without coronary thrombosis. Next, I will review echocardiographic and angiographic data to distinguish true myocardial injury from analytic noise. After that, I need to check prognostic implications and how to classify these events using the Universal Definition of MI. Finally, I should consider practical management, including when to pursue coronary angiography and how to risk-stratify patients with elevated troponins during DKA.

> Let me first confirm the clinical premise and scope. Multiple studies and case series document that a meaningful subset of patients with DKA have elevated cardiac troponins in the absence of overt acute coronary syndrome, with reported frequencies around 15–20% in contemporary cohorts and higher in some series, which supports the notion that DKA itself can be associated with troponin release independent of type 1 MI physiology [^116TkuJT] [^1117fRCU] [^114fNGnS].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude and context of these elevations. In a prospective echocardiographic and biomarker study, mean high-sensitivity cTnI during DKA was 2.1 ng/L with a range up to 11.4 ng/L, and 20% exceeded the assay-specific upper limit of normal; importantly, some patients had markedly higher peaks, including values in the thousands of ng/L, yet many had normal coronary angiography, arguing against universal obstructive CAD as the driver [^116Wuo2V]. Hold on, I should also note that pediatric and mixed cohorts show similar signals, with troponin elevations correlating with acidosis severity and often normalizing within 24 hours as the metabolic derangements correct, reinforcing a non–ACS mechanism in many cases [^114QDfbA] [^111G7wc9].

> I will now examine plausible mechanisms. Severe metabolic acidosis can directly impair myocardial contractility and energetics, while catecholamine surges increase oxygen demand and may cause supply–demand mismatch; elevated free fatty acids and ketone bodies can destabilize cardiomyocyte membranes and promote oxidative stress, and electrolyte shifts (notably potassium and phosphate) may further injure myocytes, all of which can lead to troponin leakage without necrotic coronary occlusion [^112kZq5c] [^115qwrXJ] [^116KumYm]. Let me consider adjunct contributors too: thiamine deficiency is not rare in DKA and correlates with higher troponin and diastolic dysfunction, and systemic inflammatory signaling may amplify myocardial vulnerability during acute decompensation [^114pbHtX] [^112kZq5c].

> Next, I should review functional cardiac data to ensure we are not missing ischemic wall motion abnormalities. Transthoracic echocardiography during DKA frequently shows a hyperdynamic state with shortened isovolumetric times and increased contractility, and many troponin-positive patients exhibit transient left ventricular dysfunction that improves after DKA resolution; importantly, several had normal coronary angiography, supporting non–ACS myocardial injury or stunning rather than plaque rupture [^114QDfbA] [^113wpxyB] [^113ia7Yn]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — some patients do have CAD or stress-induced cardiomyopathy, so normal coronaries are not universal, but the aggregate data indicate that troponin elevation in DKA is multifactorial and not solely attributable to obstructive disease [^11443LsC] [^113ia7Yn] [^115co6pp].

> I need to check prognostic implications carefully. Elevated troponin in DKA without evident ACS is associated with worse short- and long-term outcomes, including higher mortality and major adverse cardiac events, and in some series troponin elevation independently predicted MACE better than a history of CAD, underscoring its prognostic value even when angiography is nonobstructive [^114fNGnS] [^115qkz6Q] [^114s4qYq]. But wait, what if this is just epiphenomena of severity? Even after adjustment, the association persists in several cohorts, suggesting that troponin release captures real myocardial vulnerability during metabolic crisis and may identify patients who warrant closer cardiovascular follow-up and risk modification [^114fNGnS] [^115qkz6Q].

> Let me think about classification next. According to the Fourth Universal Definition, when troponin rises and/or falls with at least one value above the 99th percentile and there is evidence of a supply–demand imbalance without plaque rupture, the event meets criteria for type 2 myocardial infarction; if there is no ischemic evidence, it is best termed myocardial injury. In DKA, many cases align with type 2 MI or myocardial injury due to acidosis, catecholamines, and systemic stress, though a minority will harbor concurrent type 1 MI and require full ACS evaluation [^115Z2cYr] [^115ZaBH4]. Hmm, wait a minute — some reports still conflate injury and infarction; I should confirm that the diagnosis hinges on ischemic features and clinical context rather than troponin alone [^115Z2cYr].

> I should double-check management implications. Guidelines advise measuring troponin in patients with DKA, especially when symptoms, ECG changes, or hemodynamic instability raise concern for ACS; if troponin is elevated, obtain serial measurements, repeat ECGs, and pursue echocardiography to assess ventricular function, while reserving invasive coronary angiography for those with persistent ischemic symptoms, dynamic ST-T changes, arrhythmias, shock, or high-risk features. In parallel, treat DKA with guideline-directed fluids, insulin, and electrolytes, and address precipitating causes; consider early cardiology involvement for type 2 MI or persistent dysfunction, and tailor fluid strategy in patients with cardiac compromise to avoid overload [^112MEhEp] [^112YtsdG] [^1117ZCKL] [^116vxCdp]. Hold on, I should verify that in euglycemic DKA the same principles apply — yes, the diagnostic and cardiovascular evaluation framework remains the same even when glucose is modestly elevated [^112MEhEp].

> Let me reconsider special contexts that can confound interpretation. Acute kidney injury is common in DKA and can modulate troponin kinetics, and high-sensitivity assays may detect elevations in AKI even without MI; therefore, dynamic change and ischemic context are crucial to avoid overcalling MI in the setting of renal dysfunction. Also, SGLT2 inhibitor–associated euglycemic DKA is increasingly recognized; troponin may still be elevated in this scenario, and clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for DKA when glucose is normal but acidosis and ketonemia are present [^112LxJKN] [^117SrKhk] [^116v1qa5]. I should confirm that perioperative guidance advises holding SGLT2 inhibitors to mitigate euDKA risk, which aligns with cardiology and endocrine recommendations [^113otkUg] [^114vLWKb].

> In summary, yes — DKA can cause elevated cardiac troponins via multiple non–ACS mechanisms, including acidosis, catecholamine surge, lipotoxicity, oxidative stress, and electrolyte shifts, with supportive evidence from frequent biomarker elevations, transient echocardiographic dysfunction, and normal coronary angiography in many patients. Clinically, troponin elevation in DKA should trigger careful evaluation for type 2 MI or myocardial injury, guide risk stratification, and inform follow-up, while avoiding premature anchoring on type 1 MI unless ischemic criteria are met [^116TkuJT] [^1117fRCU] [^114fNGnS] [^115Z2cYr].

---

DKA can cause **elevated troponins** through metabolic acidosis, electrolyte disturbances, and catecholamine surge, leading to myocardial injury without coronary occlusion [^112kZq5c]. Troponin elevation occurs in **10–20% of DKA cases** and correlates with severity of acidosis and electrolyte imbalance [^116TkuJT] [^114QDfbA]. Most elevations are **transient and resolve with DKA treatment**, but persistent or very high troponins may indicate true ischemia or myocarditis and should prompt further evaluation [^1117fRCU]. Troponin testing is recommended in DKA with chest pain, ECG changes, or hemodynamic instability, and management should focus on correcting metabolic derangements while excluding acute coronary syndrome [^112MEhEp].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms of troponin elevation in DKA

Several mechanisms can cause **myocardial injury and troponin release** in DKA:

- **Metabolic acidosis**: Severe acidosis impairs myocardial contractility and metabolism, causing injury and troponin release [^115qwrXJ].

- **Electrolyte disturbances**: Hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and phosphate depletion increase myocardial irritability and ischemia risk [^notfound].

- **Catecholamine surge**: Elevated catecholamines increase myocardial oxygen demand and cause direct toxicity, leading to injury [^notfound].

- **Oxidative stress and inflammation**: Hyperglycemia and ketosis drive oxidative stress and inflammation, injuring myocytes [^112kZq5c].

---

## Incidence and clinical significance of troponin elevation in DKA

Troponin elevation occurs in **10–20% of DKA cases** and is usually transient, resolving with metabolic correction [^1117fRCU]. It correlates with severity of acidosis, electrolyte imbalance, and catecholamine excess [^114QDfbA]. Persistent or very high troponins may indicate true ischemia or myocarditis and warrant further evaluation [^notfound].

---

## Clinical implications and prognostic significance

Troponin elevation in DKA is associated with higher risk of **adverse cardiovascular events**, including arrhythmias, heart failure, and death [^114fNGnS]. It also reflects the severity of metabolic derangement and guides risk stratification and monitoring.

---

## Diagnostic approach and management

Troponin testing is recommended in DKA when there is chest pain, ECG changes, or hemodynamic instability [^notfound]. Management centers on **correcting metabolic derangements** — fluid resuscitation, insulin therapy, and electrolyte replacement — while excluding acute coronary syndrome (ACS) [^1117ZCKL]. Persistent or very high troponins, or ongoing ischemic symptoms, should prompt further evaluation for ACS or myocarditis [^notfound].

---

## Differentiating true myocardial infarction from non-ischemic troponin elevation

Differentiating true MI from non-ischemic troponin elevation in DKA requires **clinical context, ECG findings, and serial troponin measurements** [^115Z2cYr]. True MI typically shows a dynamic rise/fall in troponins with ischemic symptoms or ECG changes, whereas non-ischemic elevations are often transient and lack ischemic features [^115Z2cYr].

---

DKA can cause **elevated troponins** through metabolic acidosis, electrolyte disturbances, and catecholamine surge, leading to myocardial injury without coronary occlusion. Most elevations are transient and resolve with treatment, but persistent or very high troponins may indicate true ischemia or myocarditis and should be further evaluated.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis: evaluation and treatment [^112MEhEp]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a life-threatening complication of type 1 and type 2 diabetes resulting from an absolute or relative insulin deficiency. It can occur in patients of all ages and can be the initial presentation of diabetes, especially in young children. Polyuria and polydipsia are the most common symptoms, followed by nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, weight loss, severe fatigue, dyspnea, and preceding febrile illness. Traditionally, DKA has been diagnosed by the triad of hyperglycemia (blood glucose greater than 250 mg/dL), metabolic acidosis (pH less than 7.3, serum bicarbonate less than 18 mEq/L, anion gap greater than 10 mEq/L), and elevated serum (preferred) or urine ketones. However, hyperglycemia has been de-emphasized in recent guidelines because of the increasing incidence of euglycemic DKA. The use of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors modestly increases the risk of DKA and euglycemic DKA. Electrolytes, phosphate, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, urinalysis, complete blood cell count with differential, A1C, and electrocardiography should be evaluated for all patients diagnosed with DKA to identify causes and complications of DKA. Amylase, lipase, hepatic transaminase levels, troponin, creatine kinase, blood and urine cultures, and chest radiography are additional tests to consider. Treatment involves fluid and electrolyte replacement, insulin, treatment of precipitating causes, and close monitoring to adjust therapy and identify complications. Prevention strategies include identifying diabetes before DKA develops, educating patients to manage high-risk situations, and ensuring uninterrupted access to therapies for diabetes.

### Positive troponin in diabetic ketoacidosis without evident acute coronary syndrome predicts adverse cardiac events [^114fNGnS]. Clinical Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Elevated troponin I has been associated with increased mortality in critically ill patients without acute coronary syndrome (ACS). However, the prognostic significance of troponin elevation in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) without evident ACS has not been studied.

Methods

Retrospective study of all patients admitted to a U.S. tertiary center between 01/98 and 12/00 with DKA and had troponin I level measured. Patients with evidence of ACS or who met the American College of Cardiology/European Society of Cardiology (ACC/ESC) definition for myocardial infarction were excluded. Baseline characteristics, cardiac evaluation and 2 year major adverse coronary event (MACE) rate were compared between patients with positive and negative troponin.

Results

Ninety-six patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria of this study, 26 had positive troponin. There were no differences in baseline characteristics between the two groups. After a 2 year follow-up, there was significantly increased mortality in patients with elevated troponin (50.0% versus 27.1%, hazard-ratio (HR) 2.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2–4.8, p = 0.02). Patients with elevated troponin also had significantly increased MACE rate at 2 years (50.0% versus 28.6%, HR 2.6, 95% CI 1.3–5.3, p = 0.007) driven primarily by mortality. Using Cox Proportional Hazard Analysis, elevated troponin was a predictor of increased MACE after adjusting for confounding variables. (Adjusted HR 2.3, 95% CI 1.1–4.6, p = 0.02)

Conclusions

Elevated troponin I in diabetic patients admitted with DKA identifies a group at very high risk for future cardiac events and mortality. Whether cardiac risk stratification of these patients will improve long term outcome remains to be studied.

### Comprehensive echocardiographic and biomarker assessment of patients with diabetic ketoacidosis [^116TkuJT]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a severe acute complication of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). It is caused by an absolute or relative deficiency of insulin and presents with hyperglycemia, metabolic acidosis, severe electrolytic derangements and increased concentrations of ketone bodies. During an episode of DKA, systemic stress, catecholamine release, acidosis, high levels of circulating fatty acids, water deficit and electrolytic alterations can affect the structure and function of the heart, even leading to myocardial injury, as some studies have suggested that up to 20% of patients have elevated levels of cardiac troponin (cTnI) and other biomarkers of injury. Some previous observational studies have shown that those patients with cTnI elevations during an episode of DKA are at an increased risk of having major adverse cardiovascular events. To date, a complete characterization of the functional and structural variations of the heart during an episode of DKA has not been performed. In addition, it is not clear whether patients with elevated cTn levels demonstrate signs of cardiac dysfunction on echocardiographic evaluation.

In this study, we aimed to describe the changes in cardiac structure and function during and after an episode of DKA and to assess whether there is echocardiographic evidence of cardiac dysfunction in patients with elevated cTn.

### Myocardial injury with biomarker elevation in diabetic ketoacidosis [^116KumYm]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2005). Low credibility.

We report of two patients with severe ketoacidosis, minute elevations of myocardial biomarkers (troponin T and CK-MB) and initial ECG changes compatible with myocardial infarction (MI). All successive investigations, including coronary arteriography, were normal, and the patients recovered fully without further evidence of ischemic heart disease. We suggest that acidosis and very high levels of free fatty acids could cause membrane instability and biomarker leakage. Regardless of the pathogenesis, these two case stories suggest that nonspecific myocardial injury may occur in severe diabetic ketoacidosis and that the presence of minute biomarker elevation and ECG changes does not necessarily signify MI.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis, respiratory distress and myocardial dysfunction [^116NSpaD]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

This case report describes a patient with respiratory distress, myocardial dysfunction, elevated troponin level, ECG changes and pulmonary oedema secondary to new onset diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). This case may be unique, but it is possible that less severe cases occur and are underappreciated in the paediatric setting. This report demonstrates the need to closely evaluate and monitor cardiac function in patients with DKA.

### Comprehensive echocardiographic and biomarker assessment of patients with diabetic ketoacidosis [^1117fRCU]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Systemic stress, inflammation, and hydroelectrolytic and acid‒base abnormalities observed during diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) can cause changes in the heart and even induce cardiovascular damage. We aimed to evaluate the structure and function of the heart during and after a DKA episode via echocardiography and biomarker assessment.

Methods

We performed a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) in subjects with an episode of DKA in the first 4–6 h of treatment. We evaluated left ventricular wall thickness, diameters and volumes, as well as systolic and diastolic function using tissue Doppler imaging, pulsed wave Doppler and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Left ventricular function was also assessed with global longitudinal strain (GLS). We obtained cardiac troponin levels in the first 24 h after admission. A second TTE was performed following the same protocol 6–12 h after the resolution of the DKA episode.

Results

We included a total of 20 subjects. The mean age was 33 ± 13.6 years; 70% were female, and 70% had type 1 DM. 75% of the patients experienced severe episodes, and the rest experienced moderate episodes. Left ventricular isovolumetric contraction and ejection time were significantly shorter during DKA and prolonged after the resolution of the episodes (47.6 ± 9.9 vs. 62.2 ± 14.1, p = < 0.001) and (218.6 ± 37.9 vs. 265.06 ± 34.7). The isovolumetric relaxation time was also shorter during DKA, (41.72 ± 8.29 vs. 59.32 ± 17.98, p = < 0.001). Volumes and diameters of the left ventricle increased significantly after DKA resolution. We found no difference between LVEF or GLS during and after DKA resolution. 20% of the participants had troponin elevations, half of whom had moderate episodes and half of whom had severe episodes. 35% had LV dysfunction, 28.5% both in GLS and LVEF. 28.5% occurred after DKA resolution, with alterations in GLS.

Conclusions

Diabetic ketoacidosis induces changes in the structure and function of the heart, which are mostly transient, reflect the presence of a hyperdynamic state and resolve after the resolution of the episode. Some subjects present with evidence of myocardial injury with elevated cardiac troponin and left ventricular dysfunction.

### Clinical significance of troponin elevations in acute decompensated diabetes without clinical acute coronary syndrome [^111G7wc9]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Elevated cardiac biomarkers in decompensated diabetes in the absence of an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) have been described in several case reports. While non-ACS related cardiac biomarkers have been studied in various acute and chronic medical conditions, acute decompensated diabetes has received less attention. Acute decompensated diabetes and ACS, share a complex dynamic that results in significant ambiguity when interpreting biomarker elevation in this setting. Such ambiguity is concerning because myocardial infarction has been shown to be the most common cause of death within the first 24 hours of admission for acutely decompensated diabetes.

Recent studies have highlighted a novel relationship between the severity of acidemia in acute decom-pensated diabetes and abnormal elevations in cardiac troponin-I (cTnI). Moller et al. describe patients in diabetic ketoacidosis with severe acidemia and abnormally elevated cTnI who had no angiographic evidence of coronary artery disease (CAD), leading them to suggest that ketoacidemia may contribute to elevations in cardiac enzymes.

Since the number of hospital discharges for acute decompensated diabetes has doubled since 1980 and the worldwide incidence of diabetes mellitus (DM) is expected to double over the next 15 years, defining the importance of elevated cardiac biomarkers in diabetic disorders is critical. In this study, we assessed the clinical significance of abnormal elevations in cTnI in decompensated diabetics.

### Increased cardiac troponin I concentration in diabetic ketoacidosis [^114QDfbA]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the hypothesis that diabetic ketoacidosis may be associated with some degree of induced injury to heart muscle, related either to acidosis or hyperglycemia.

Methods

Nineteen diabetic patients with acute ketoacidosis and 19 healthy children were enrolled in this study. Cardiac troponin I (cTnI), creatine kinase (CK)-MB and myoglobin levels were analyzed soon after admission and after 24 h. Patients were subdivided into two groups according to blood pH.

Results

At the time of admission, the diabetic patients had significantly higher values than the controls for cTnI (0.193 ± 0.008 vs 0.176 ± 0.006 ng/dl; p < 0.001), CK-MB (24.1 ± 2.1 vs 22.7 ± 1.2 U/l; p = 0.02), and myoglobin (85.5 ± 7.4 vs 52.5 ± 8.3 microg/dl; p < 0.001). The diabetic patients also had significantly higher values than the controls for CK-MB (24 ± 2.1 vs 22.7 ± 1.2 U/l; p = 0.02) and for myoglobin (78.5 ± 2.5 vs 52.5 ± 8.3 microg/dl; p < 0.001) at 24 h. cTnI had normalized in patients at 24 h. All parameters were significantly different between patients with pH ≥ 7.0 and patients with pH < 7.0. In addition, serum cTnI levels correlated negatively with blood pH (r = -0.57, p = 0.026) and HCO3- (r = -0.65, p = 0.008) in the patients with diabetic ketoacidosis on admission.

Conclusion

Our findings suggest that diabetic ketoacidosis, particularly when severe, has a detrimental effect on the myocardium.

### Comprehensive echocardiographic and biomarker assessment of patients with diabetic ketoacidosis [^113wpxyB]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Diabetic ketoacidosis is associated with changes in the structure and function of the heart, which are transient and probably related to the alterations in intravascular volume, systemic stress and hypercontractility that are observed in these states. Some patients have elevations in cardiac troponins and abnormalities in ventricular function that could be related to the severity of the episode, the cause of decompensation and the presence of cardiovascular damage prior to the episodes. Changes in echocardiographic parameters after DKA treatment suggest that Inferior vena cava and cardiac ultrasound could have a role guiding fluid therapy in DKA. Larger studies with diverse DKA severities and follow-up are needed to confirm our findings and to better understand the effects of these episodes on the heart.

### A child with altered sensorium, hyperglycemia, and elevated troponins [^113nUUXB]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state (HHS) are potentially life-threatening complications of diabetes mellitus. Although DKA and HHS share similar features, they are distinct clinical entities requiring different treatment measures.

Objective

This case illustrates that the clinical distinction between these two entities can be difficult at times, especially in children who can present with an overlapping picture.

Case Report

We report an interesting case of a 12-year-old whose initial presentation of diabetes was a mixed picture of hyperosmolar DKA and HHS coma complicated by myocardial strain and acute renal insufficiency. The myocardial strain resolved completely with resolution of the metabolic abnormalities.

Conclusions

Emergency physicians should be cognizant of varied presentations of hyperglycemic emergencies in children to initiate appropriate management for better outcomes.

Troponin levels during DKA episodes

The mean cTnI level during DKA was 2.1 (0.03–11.4) ng/L. Four subjects (20%) had cTnI levels above the normal limit; the highest levels of cTnI were observed in 2 subjects with severe DKA, whereas the other two with only mild elevation of cTnI had moderate DKA. All the subjects with elevated troponin levels had LV dysfunction, two of them had impaired LVEF and GLS. One of them had the highest troponin levels (3140.3 ng/L). This subject was an 18-year-old male with type 1 DM whose decompensation was due to a combination of infection (pneumonia) and interruption of his insulin regimen. The other patient was a 55-year-old female with type 2 DM and only moderate DKA. The other subject with the highest cTnI level (1663.9 ng/L) was a 19-year-old individual with type 1 DM and severe DKA. Both the LVEF and GLS were normal during DKA, but the GLS decreased to values below the normal limit after the resolution of the episode. A complete description of the subjects with increased levels of cTnI is shown in Table 6.

### Clinical significance of troponin elevations in acute decompensated diabetes without clinical acute coronary syndrome [^116vTkAk]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2012). Low credibility.

Methods

We performed a retrospective review of 872 charts for patients admitted to Temple University Hospital (TUH) with a diagnosis of "Diabetic Ketoacidemia" between 2004–2009. Approval for this chart review was obtained from the Institutional Review Board. Inclusion criteria required patients to have levels of cTnI within 24 hours of admission, a history of prior or newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus, and evidence of diabetic ketoacidemia (DKA) or the hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS). DKA and HHS were defined in accord with common clinical practice. 298 patients met inclusion criteria.

For patients that met inclusion criteria, if levels of CK-MB were also measured, serum values for both biomarker sub-types were recorded. Patients were considered to have abnormal elevations in cardiac biomarkers if either CK-MB (0.00–7.50 ng/ml) or cTnI (0.05–0.40 ng/ml) were above the hospital's normal reference level.

Patients were excluded from the study if they had evidence of acute coronary syndrome in accord with the AHA/ACC Guidelines, or if the patient died during the hospitalization. ECGs were analyzed retrospectively by two separate physicians blinded to clinical outcomes. An ECG was determined to be consistent with ACS if there was ≥ 1 mm ST depression or ≥ 2 mm ischemic T wave inversion, new Q- waves, new left bundle branch block, or ST elevations consistent with ischemia. Of the 298 patients who met inclusion criteria, 34 were excluded because of suspected or confirmed ACS, or death during admission (See Figure 1). For the remaining 264 patients, prior medical history, and key hospital data were recorded. Using the electronic medical record, Alpha Imaging Systems®, Centricity®, PACS® image viewer and EPIC®, both inpatient and outpatient medical records were reviewed to record baseline patient characteristics, length of hospital stay, length of follow up, and to assess the time interval in months to the occurrence of a major adverse cardiac event (MACE). MACE was defined as myocardial infarction, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), or death. Only the first admission was included for patients admitted more than once. chronic renal insufficiency was defined as baseline creatinine above 1.4 mg/dL, end stage renal disease (ESRD) was defined as patients on hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis.

Investigations

His initial troponin I was 938 ng/L, which subsequently peaked at 2679 ng/L with the reference range being < 20 ng/L. He was cleared by neurosurgery and subsequently underwent coronary angiography. This revealed non-obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) (figure 2) and the left-ventriculogram showed reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of about 40% with apical ballooning. Echocardiogram showed an LVEF of 50% and apical akinesis with ballooning and hyperkinetic basal and mid segments (video 1). This picture was consistent with TS. A detailed history did not reveal any recent emotional or physical stress. He made an uneventful recovery and was discharged from the hospital. On discharge, his troponin had already started to decrease, falling to 1428 ng/L indicating no ongoing insult to his myocardium.

Figure 2
Angiogram on initial presentation.

Six days later, the patient received his second course of Ipi/Nivo. Four days after the ICI treatment, he re-presented with recurrent chest pain. His initial troponin I of 26 ng/L rose to 674 ng/L within 2 hours. Blood tests revealed diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) with a blood glucose level of 24.6 mmol/L (normal range 3–7.8 mmol/L), ketones of 6.6 mmol/L (range < 1 mmol/L) and a pH of 7.12 (normal range 7.32–7.43). He was managed with nitrates, antiplatelet agents and enoxaparin once again together with intravenous rehydration, but an angiogram was not performed. An echocardiogram demonstrated ongoing hypokinesis of the apical segments.

The troponin levels returned to normal soon after the symptoms got resolved. Clinical features were not suggestive of myocarditis.

During acidosis, the lungs rapidly compensate for the pH decrease by eliminating CO2, so AG and DG could better reflect acid gain during DKA. We found no relationship between AG and GLS. The DG (ΔAG/ΔHCO3 −) reflects the magnitude of the AG elevation with respect to HCO3 − reduction; in DKA, the relation is near to 1:1 and normal levels between 0.5 and 1, higher levels could suggest a greater acid gain with lower HCO3 − buffering capacity. In our study, the mean DG was 0.8 ± 0.3, and we found that with a higher DG, the GLS was lower, although the association was weak.

We found that 35% of our patients had some type of LV dysfunction, 28.5% had abnormalities in both GLS and LVEF, and the remaining patients had abnormalities in only GLS. A total of 28.5% of the cases of LV dysfunction occurred after DKA resolution, with alterations in GLS and minor abnormalities in LVEF. 57% of the cases were in severe DKA, and 57% of the cases occurred in patients with troponin elevation. The fact that some of the patients who presented with LV dysfunction with moderate DKA were older and had type 2 DM suggests that chronic cardiac stress in diabetic patients could predispose them to cardiac injury and dysfunction even with milder forms of DKA. All the subjects recovered LV function, although not all reached normal levels.

20% of our subjects had elevated troponin levels, which is consistent with the literature. Half of the subjects had moderate DKA, while the other half had severe DKA. Troponin elevation in moderate DKA occurred in patients with either prior long-standing type 2 DM or with an infection as the cause of decompensation, suggesting that prior cardiac damage or the etiology of decompensation could predispose patients to myocardial injury even in milder episodes of DKA. The troponin levels in our study were higher than those previously reported in the literature, and contrary to what has been reported, we did not find an association between DKA severity and cTnI elevation. We did find that elevated cTnI levels were associated with worse LV function measured with GLS both during and after DKA, although the association was weak and appeared to be influenced by elevated troponin levels in isolated patients.

### Myocardial dysfunction in relation to serum thiamine levels in children with diabetic ketoacidosis [^114pbHtX]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Background Thiamine deficiency is commonly reported in patients with diabetes especially during diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) that could attribute to myocardial dysfunction in those patients. However, there is limited data regarding its relation to myocardial function among those patients. This study aimed to explore the association between myocardial function and serum thiamine levels in children with type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM). Methods This cross-sectional comparative study included 25 patients with DKA. Clinical data assessment, echocardiographic examination and measurement of serum high-sensitive troponin T (hs-cTnT) and thiamine levels were done. We also assessed the association between troponin levels, echocardiographic ventricular systolic and diastolic function and serum thiamine. Results Twenty-four percent of children with DKA had thiamine deficiency. DKA children with thiamine deficiency had significant acidosis and higher serum troponin levels and significant impairment of diastolic function than those without thiamine deficiency. The serum thiamine level had a significant positive correlation with the echocardiographic indices of diastolic function but negative correlation with troponin levels. Conclusions Thiamine deficiency is a common finding during the treatment of children with DKA, and this deficiency may be associated with myocardial dysfunction.

### Comprehensive echocardiographic and biomarker assessment of patients with diabetic ketoacidosis [^113t53Ad]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

We designed a cross-sectional, observational and comparative study. From January to November 2022, we included patients with type 1 and type 2 DM coming to the emergency room with DKA who gave their consent to participate in the study and were in the first 4–6 h after the beginning of treatment. The diagnosis of DKA was made using the criteria proposed by the American Diabetes Association (ADA). We excluded patients if they had signs of shock, severe sepsis, acute kidney injury greater than AKIN 1, chronic kidney disease (CKD), prior diagnosis of cardiovascular disease (e.g. heart failure (HF), myocardial infarction, structural heart disease, or atrial fibrillation), blood pressure > 160/100 mmHg or suspicion of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Patients who were included and found to have a poor echocardiographic window, structural heart disease or valvular heart disease with severity greater than mild were also excluded. The first plasma glucose levels drawn before the beginning of treatment were used as the basal levels; the DKA episode was classified as mild, moderate or severe on the basis of HCO3 − and pH levels, according to standard recommendations. When the levels of pH and HCO3 − were discordant from each other, we used the lowest one to define severity. We calculated the anion gap (AG) with the following formula: Sodium - (Chloride + Bicarbonate), using the measured sodium (Na +), not corrected for glucose levels, and documented the delta gap (DG) ΔAG/ΔHCO3 −, which represents the degree to which the AG changes in relation to the decrease in HCO3 −. Basal hemoglobin, creatinine, serum electrolytes, albumin, amylase, triglycerides and total cholesterol were also documented. We measured high-sensitivity cTnI levels in the first 24 h after enrollment via a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (ARCHITECT STAT, Abbott) with cutoff values for positivity > 34.2 ng/L for males and > 15.6 ng/L for females. Serum electrolytes and venous blood gases were measured every 4 h, and capillary glucose was measured every hour. DKA management was undertaken by attending physicians in the emergency department according to current guidelines, and resolution was considered when glucose levels were < 200 mg/dl and two of the following were present: AG ≤ 12, pH > 7.30 or HCO3 − ≥ 15 mmol/L. An institutional review board and ethics committee reviewed and approved this study (CA22–0003).

### Clinical features and prognosis of type 2 myocardial infarction in acutely decompensated diabetic patients [^111pK8Aj]. The American Journal of Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

After the introduction of the universal definition of myocardial infarction, the incidence and diagnosis of type 2 myocardial infarction have risen dramatically, yet there are no clear guidelines on clinical management. Diabetic patients are at high risk for developing type 2 myocardial infarction when admitted in a decompensated state, and they are also at high risk for future cardiovascular events.

Methods

We performed a retrospective analysis of 1058 patients admitted with diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state between 2011 and 2016. Patients were included if they had cardiac troponin I measured within 24 hours of admission, were older than 18 years of age, and had no evidence of acute coronary syndrome on admission. Baseline characteristics, admission laboratory test results, major adverse cardiovascular events, cardiac stress testing, and coronary angiography data up to 1 year after admission were reviewed. Patients were categorized into 2 groups: those with and those without type 2 myocardial infarction. The study had 2 endpoints: mortality and major adverse cardiac events (MACE) at 1 year and an abnormal result on stress test or coronary angiography at 1 year.

Results

Of the 845 patients who met the inclusion criteria, 133 patients (15%) had type 2 myocardial infarction on admission. Patients with type 2 myocardial infarction were at a significantly higher risk for mortality and MACE at 1 year than those without. Patients with type 2 myocardial infarction were also at higher risk for developing an abnormal result on stress test or coronary angiography within 1 year of admission as compared with those without type 2 myocardial infarction (40% vs 24%; odds ratio 2; p = 0.0699).

Conclusion

Acutely decompensated diabetic patients with type 2 myocardial infarction are at increased risk for death and MACE. These patients may also be at risk for undiagnosed coronary artery disease.

### Comprehensive echocardiographic and biomarker assessment of patients with diabetic ketoacidosis [^114LaMqb]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2024). Medium credibility.

Our study has multiple limitations. First, the sample size is small, and it is likely that some of our findings, particularly those of the correlation analysis, are influenced by this; however, this is the largest study that has evaluated the heart during a DKA episode with a detailed echocardiographic and biomarker assessment. Most of the DKA events were severe, and we could not explore whether the severity of the episodes determined the presence of abnormalities in both biomarkers and echocardiograms. Control echocardiograms were performed 6–12 h after the resolution of the episodes, and it is likely that patients were still in a state of systemic stress that could have diminished the differences in the echocardiographic findings during and after the episodes. Most changes in volumes and diameters appear to be associated with the aggressive use of IV fluids during standard care for DKA; overhydration has been shown to be harmful in other clinical scenarios, but data in DKA is lacking. The changes in volumes and diameters seen in our study could suggest a role for imaging to guide fluid replacement if patients with DKA and avoid harm due to overhydration. Since the subjects were often found with polypnea and tachycardia, and were frequently thin and small, they tended to have a poor echocardiographic window, and the acquisition of echocardiograms during DKA episodes was challenging; however, in the final analysis, only those subjects whose image quality was suitable for adequate interpretation were included. Troponin levels were measured in the first 24 h after admission for all the subjects, but acquisition times were different between subjects; it is difficult to determine whether the levels we found could have varied if all the subjects had a determination at the same time point. In addition, we excluded patients with suspicion of ACS based on symptoms and electrocardiographic signs of ischemia, but did not perform additional test to exclude coronary artery disease, however, our results are in accordance with what has been previously reported in the literature. Finally, we did not follow these subjects after discharge, and we do not know if these findings have any prognostic relevance.

There was no difference in the SV, cardiac output or cardiac index during or after DKA. When assessing the RV, we found no difference between the TAPSE and the RV S' wave. TEI index increased after DKA resolution, for most patients it remained unchanged and within normal ranges; the patient with the highest value of cTnI had an index of 0.95 that increased to 1.14 after DKA resolution. Other patients with troponin elevations also showed an increase of the TEI index after the resolution of DKA. Table 3 shows a comparison of left and right ventricular systolic function during and after DKA episodes.

### Clinical significance of troponin elevations in acute decompensated diabetes without clinical acute coronary syndrome [^114s4qYq]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2012). Low credibility.

Logistic regression models identified an elevated admission serum cTnI as the only statistically significant variable for the long term composite outcome, MACE. Of interest is the finding that CK-MB was not correlated with the long term MACE outcome. Furthermore, an elevated admission serum cTnI proved to be a better predictor for MACE than a prior history of CAD (p = 0.127). MACE was primarily driven by myocardial infarction, thus it was unexpected that a prior history of CAD was not a statistically significant independent predictor. More likely, MACE incidence represents multiple pathophysiologic mechanisms, independent of a prior history of CAD alone.

One factor, likely playing a major role in this cohort is insulin resistance. Recent literature has recognized more aggressive forms of type 2 diabetes marked by greater insulin resistance. When these patients decompensate, they have increased production of ketoacids and more severe acidemia. Over time, insulin resistance leads to increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines like CRP and homocysteine that accelerate atherogenesis, plaque rupture, and MACE. This study noted an admission serum pH of less than 7.1 to trend toward statistical significance in an unadjusted logistic regression, and after adjusting for other variables, demonstrated a statistical significance for MACE. Demographically, patients with such aggressive forms of diabetes mellitus tend to be African American, in major urban cities. In comparison, 70% of the patients in our study were African Americans in a major urban city. The data suggest that patients in our study have a more aggressive form of diabetes mellitus that predisposes them to MACE independent of a prior history of CAD, and thus are at increased risk.

### Clinical significance of troponin elevations in acute decompensated diabetes without clinical acute coronary syndrome [^115qkz6Q]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Elevation of cardiac troponin has been documented in multiple settings without acute coronary syndrome. However, its impact on long-term cardiac outcomes in the context of acute decompensated diabetes remains to be explored.

Methods

We performed a retrospective analysis of 872 patients admitted to Temple University Hospital from 2004–2009 with DKA or HHS. Patients were included if they had cardiac troponin I (cTnI) measured within 24 hours of hospital admission, had no evidence of acute coronary syndrome and had a follow up period of at least 18 months. Of the 264 patients who met the criteria, we reviewed the baseline patient characteristics, admission labs, EKGs and major adverse cardiovascular events during the follow up period. Patients were categorized into two groups with normal and elevated levels of cardiac enzymes. The composite end point of the study was the occurrence of a major cardiovascular event (MACE) during the follow up period and was compared between the two groups.

Results

Of 264 patients, 24 patients were found to have elevated cTnI. Compared to patients with normal cardiac enzymes, there was a significant increase in incidence of MACE in patients with elevated cTnI. In a regression analysis, which included prior history of CAD, HTN and ESRD, the only variable that independently predicted MACE was an elevation in cTnI (p = 0.044). Patients with elevated CK-MB had increased lengths of hospitalization compared to the other group (p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Elevated cardiac troponin I in patients admitted with decompensated diabetes and without evidence of acute coronary syndrome, strongly correlate with a later major cardiovascular event. Thus, elevated troponin I during metabolic abnormalities identify a group of patients at an increased risk for poor long-term outcomes. Whether these patients may benefit from early detection, risk stratification and preventive interventions remains to be investigated.

### Clinical significance of troponin elevations in acute decompensated diabetes without clinical acute coronary syndrome [^111YH8iS]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2012). Low credibility.

Conclusions and clinical implications

As a result of this study, we have identified independent prognostic factors which can help guide clinical management and predict elevations in cTnI, as well as short term and long term outcomes. While a prior history of CAD. Disease plays a key pathophysiologic role, the severity of acidemia appears to be equally important. cTnI and CK-MB should be measured in all patients with acute decompensated diabetes, if elevated, in the absence of clinically evident ACS, findings in this study identify a patient population that is at increased risk for a longer hospital stay in the short term, and increased risk for MACE post-discharge.

### Acute myocardial infarction in a 12-year-old as a complication of hyperosmolar diabetic ketoacidosis [^115kA4Wf]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE: This report describes the evolution of an acute myocardial infarction in a 12-yr-old male with severe hyperosmolarity secondary to diabetic ketoacidosis. DESIGN: Case report. SETTING: Intensive care unit of a university teaching hospital. Patient: A 12-yr-old male with new-onset diabetic ketoacidosis and an abnormal electrocardiogram. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The evolution of an acute myocardial infarction in this patient is described. This includes serial electrocardiographic, echocardiographic, and enzymatic changes. Early recognition of this complication of diabetic ketoacidosis prompted immediate initiation of antithrombotic therapy and possible prevention of infarct extension. CONCLUSION: This report demonstrates the need for accurate electrocardiographic monitoring in these patients, both for arrhythmias as well as ischemic changes and the potential for myocardial injury caused by hyperosmolarity.

### Euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis associated with ST segment elevation myocardial infarction following SGLT-2 inhibitor therapy [^115VbPU2]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors are the latest approved class of oral antidiabetic agents that inhibit renal SGLT-2 receptors and increase urinary glucose excretion in the luminal membrane of the proximal tubule. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a triad of hyperglycemia, ketosis, and a high anion gap with metabolic acidosis. We present the case of 61 years-old men with severe euglycemic DKA (EDKA) complicated ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction following SGLT-2 inhibitor therapy for type 2 diabetes mellitus. Atypical presentation of ketoacidosis without hyperglycemia can delay diagnosis and may result in catastrophic complications. Quick diagnosis, appropriate clinical and biochemical assessment, and effective treatment protocols ensure successful resolution of EDKA.

### Clinical significance of troponin elevations in acute decompensated diabetes without clinical acute coronary syndrome [^116gyfC4]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2012). Low credibility.

Concomitantly, in the context of non-diabetic patients status-post myocardial infarction, Knudsen et al. advance our premise. In an article published in 2010, they present a preponderance of evidence which highlights the connection between pro-inflammatory cytokines and deranged blood glucose control.

Studies by Hernandez et al. noted that 21% of diabetics have silent ischemia, and Zheng et al. suggest patients with diabetes have a chronic level of myocardial injury, and identified a correlation with blood glucose and elevated levels of serum hs-cTnT. Populations such as this cohort, which stand at increased risk for adverse cardiac events underscore the need for future studies that further characterize a complex pathway.

Our findings corroborate those of Al-Mallah et al. who identified cTnI as prognostic for long term cardiovascular events in the context of DKA. This study differed in that we demonstrated a different relationship of MACE to Troponin and to CK-MB. Further, our study identified independent prognostic variables that predict elevations in serum cTnI, lending an objective basis to explain their clinical significance. Further, we assessed short term outcomes, and identified CK-MB as an independent predictor for length of hospital stay. Thus, we define a novel role for CK-MB in the context of acute decompensated diabetes. Regarding patient characteristics, while both studies were relatively small, our study had nearly twice as many participants enrolled (n = 264 v n = 96) and our average length of follow up was nearly twice that of the prior study (40 months v 24 months).

Study limitations

This study was retrospective with a small sample size. In the future there is a need for larger multicenter prospective studies. Additionally, we lacked angiographic evidence at time of admission required to characterize coronary anatomy and thus patients were excluded based upon clinical information alone.

### Comprehensive echocardiographic and biomarker assessment of patients with diabetic ketoacidosis [^112kZq5c]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In our study, we found that during DKA, the heart shows structural and functional changes that appear to be transient and associated with the systemic stress and hyperadrenergic state that accompanies these episodes. To our knowledge, this is the first study that combines advanced echocardiographic techniques and biomarkers to provide a detailed description of these alterations.

Multiple mechanisms can cause myocardial damage during a DKA episode. Acidosis, with direct effects on contractility, hyperglycemia leading to impaired coronary flow and oxidative stress, high levels of circulating ketone bodies and fatty acids with the potential to cause direct damage to myocardial cells, and the hyperadrenergic and proinflammatory states are some of them. The effects of DKA on the cardiovascular system have been well documented previously in diverse reports describing the presence of electrocardiographic abnormalities and increased levels of markers of cardiac injury. However, to date, this has not been confirmed in a study that adequately evaluated these effects on cardiac function.

George et al. evaluated the effects of DKA on the myocardium in 17 subjects: 12 with DKA and 5 with nonketotic hyperglycemia. Cardiac function was evaluated with M-mode echocardiography by measuring the LV diameter, preejective period, ejection time, and circumferential shortening velocity. Cardiac injury was assessed with CPK and LDH, and the levels of plasma catecholamines were measured in 5 subjects. They reported that, compared with those with nonketotic hyperglycemia, patients with DKA had shorter systolic intervals, which returned to normal after the resolution of DKA. There was no evidence of myocardial injury, and the levels of catecholamines were elevated. They concluded that during DKA, the heart is in a hypercontractile state associated with high levels of catecholamines, with normalization after the resolution of the episode and without evidence of myocardial injury. It is well known that traditional methods used to evaluate LV function are load dependent and might not be ideal for patients in situations such as DKA. In addition, the systemic stress and metabolic alterations observed in DKA patients could cause subtle myocardial damage that might not be apparent with the use of conventional techniques. This has been demonstrated in other states of systemic stress, such as sepsis. Septic cardiomyopathy usually presents with an LVEF less than 45%; however, some subjects have a normal LVEF but show signs of LV dysfunction when measured with GLS, which is associated with a worse prognosis.

### Clinical profiles, outcomes and risk factors among type 2 diabetic inpatients with diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state: a hospital-based analysis over a 6-year period [^114DKyYk]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2020). Medium credibility.

Medical history of patients included gender, age, duration of diabetes, duration of hospital stay, precipitants, chronic diabetic complications (peripheral neuropathy, retinopathy, nephropathy, peripheral vascular disease), co-morbidities (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hyperuricemia, liver and kidney disease, coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease), history of smoking and drinking, and family medical history.

Clinical features: On-admission clinical presentations (temperature, pulse rate, respiration rate, blood pressure, consciousness), laboratory parameters included blood glucose (BG), effective plasma osmolality (EPO), serum potassium (K +), serum sodium (Na +), hemoglobin (Hb), white blood cell count (WBC), red blood cell count (RBC), C-reaction protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), myohemoglobin (MYO), creatine kinase MB (CK-MB), troponin I (Tn-I), Natriuretic peptide (BNP), urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (Cr), uric acid (UA), serum calcium (Ca), serum phosphorus (P), osteocalcin, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), glycated albumin (GA-L), total protein, albumin, alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate amino transferase (AST), triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), arterial PH, blood standard bicarbonate (SB), fasting C-peptide, fasting insulin, D-Dimer, fibrinogen, prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT). Effective plasma osmolality (EPO) (mOsm/L) = 2 × [Na + + K +](mmol/L) + BG (mmol/L). Other examinations included: lower extremity vascular ultrasound and abdomen ultrasound.

The main outcome of this study was mortality due to DKA and HHS, and secondary outcomes were glycemic control including FBG before discharge and hypoglycemic events, length of hospital stay, and expenditure during hospital. Hypoglycemia was defined as capillary glucose ≤ 3.9 mmol/L or symptoms of hypoglycemia could be resolved with administration of oral carbohydrates if glucose was not measured. Severe hypoglycemia was defined as a capillary glucose < 2.8 mmol/l associated with confusion, loss of consciousness, or seizures.

### Rhabdomyolysis in diabetic ketoacidosis [^1179EX4j]. Pediatric Diabetes (2003). Low credibility.

Rhabdomyolysis is a potentially lethal disorder, characterized by elevated serum concentrations of creatine kinase (CK) due to skeletal muscle injury. In this paper a patient with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is reported who developed rhabdomyolysis (maximum CK level, 37,700 U/L; normal, < 170 U/L), anemia (6.2 g/dL) and thrombocytopenia (16,000/microL). This combination of rhabdomyolysis with anemia and thrombocytopenia has not yet been reported in DKA. The pathogenic mechanism leading to rhabdomyolysis in DKA remains unsettled. From the literature it seems that those patients who develop rhabdomyolysis have very high glucose levels and a high osmolality on admission. Low phosphate levels can play a role as well. The etiology of anemia and thrombocytopenia in our patient remains obscure. Intravascular hemolysis could not be demonstrated but intramedullar hemolysis, due to osmolar shift or hypophosphatemia, cannot be excluded. A review of the literature data revealed that rhabdomyolysis is not so uncommon in DKA. However, to obtain incidence data in children, prospective studies are necessary.

### Effect of hypoglycaemia on measures of myocardial blood flow and myocardial injury in adults with and without type 1 diabetes: a prospective, randomised, open-label, blinded endpoint, cross-over study [^116o9Qai]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Cardiac troponins are a biomarker of myocardial injury. In recent years, the introduction of a highly sensitive cardiac troponin I (hs‐cTnI) assay allows the detection of small degrees of myocardial damage. Lowering the diagnostic threshold for myocardial injury has improved outcomes for people with type 1 myocardial infarction. Hs‐cTNI also provides prognostic information regarding long term outcomes in cohorts of people with underlying coronary heart disease.

People with type 2 diabetes often have multiple cardiovascular risk factors that can confound attempts to investigate hypoglycaemia as a causative mechanism for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Younger people with type 1 diabetes of relatively short duration are less likely to have acquired these additional risk factors. To examine whether hypoglycaemia might adversely affect myocardial blood flow and cause myocardial injury, coronary flow reserve and cardiac troponins were therefore measured during experimentally‐induced hypoglycaemia in people with type 1 diabetes who had no confounding factors.

### Clinical significance of troponin elevations in acute decompensated diabetes without clinical acute coronary syndrome [^115qwrXJ]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2012). Low credibility.

Discussion

This study identified independent prognostic factors that predict elevations in serum admission cTnI, and demonstrated elevated admission serum CK-MB and cTnI as prognostic for short and long term outcomes respectively. As a result, we gained insight into the clinical significance of elevated admission serum cardiac biomarkers in acute decompensated diabetes in the absence of clinically evident ACS. In the future, these data can be used to guide management.

An admission serum pH of less than 7.1 was demonstrated to be an independent prognostic factor for elevations in serum admission cTnI. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate a relationship between serum pH and elevated serum troponin. Our study supports the concept put forth by Moller et al. who noted that patients with elevated cTnI did not have angiographic evidence of coronary artery disease but had serum admission pH values of less than 6.9.

What accounts for the correlation between cTnI and serum pH in the context of this study is unclear, and remains to be elucidated. A potential explanation highlights a complex dynamic between pH and intracellular calcium. As a result of severe acidemia, there is an increase in intracellular calcium which activates multiple biochemical pathways including proteolysis and myocardial stunning culminating in increased serum cTnI.

Approximately 40% of the patients with an elevated serum admission cTnI had a documented prior history of CAD. Regression analysis demonstrated a prior history of CAD as a prognostic factor for elevated cTnI. Acute decompensated diabetes is characterized by increased levels of counter-regulatory hormones which increase myocardial oxygen demand. In such a population, the added effect of CAD likely impairs blood flow, exacerbating a supply–demand mismatch, resulting in myonecrosis and elevations in cTnI.

### Ketosis and diabetic ketoacidosis in response to SGLT2 inhibitors: basic mechanisms and therapeutic perspectives [^114jc5ss]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Inhibitors of the sodium-glucose cotransporter SGLT2 are a new class of antihyperglycemic drugs that have been approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). These drugs inhibit glucose reabsorption in the proximal tubules of the kidney thereby enhancing glucosuria and lowering blood glucose levels. Additional consequences and benefits include a reduction in body weight, uric acid levels, and blood pressure. Moreover, SGLT2 inhibition can have protective effects on the kidney and cardiovascular system in patients with T2DM and high cardiovascular risk. However, a potential side effect that has been reported with SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with T2DM and particularly during off-label use in patients with type 1 diabetes is diabetic ketoacidosis. The US Food and Drug Administration recently warned that SGLT2 inhibitors may result in euglycemic ketoacidosis. Here, we review the basic metabolism of ketone bodies, the triggers of diabetic ketoacidosis, and potential mechanisms by which SGLT2 inhibitors may facilitate the development of ketosis or ketoacidosis. This provides the rationale for measures to lower the risk. We discuss the role of the kidney and potential links to renal gluconeogenesis and uric acid handling. Moreover, we outline potential beneficial effects of modestly elevated ketone body levels on organ function that may have therapeutic relevance for the observed beneficial effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on the kidney and cardiovascular system.

Elevating Ketones for Treatment of Patients with HF: Cautions and Contraindications

Strategies that increase circulating levels of KBs for the treatment of patients with HF and diabetes come with the risk for severe elevations, potentially inducing diabetic ketoacidosis, a life-threatening acute complication of diabetes. Diabetic ketoacidosis is a consequence of excessive lipolysis and ketogenesis associated with absolute or relative insulin deficiency and elevated levels of counterregulatory hormones. The circulating level of β-HB at which diabetic ketoacidosis occurs is variable, but most cases are seen at > 3 mmol/L, and it is more common in patients with type 1 diabetes.

Similar to levels that can be reached with prolonged fasting (2–3 mmol/L), acute intravenous infusion of β-HB in patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction raised the serum level to 3 mmol/L.SGLT2 inhibitors can raise the level of β-HB to an average level of 0.6 mmol/L in patients with diabetes and 0.3 mmol/L in those without diabetes. However, there are several case reports in which euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis was associated with SGLT2 inhibition in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Thus, even with modest increases in β-HB level by SGLT2 inhibition, potentially deleterious elevations have occurred in susceptible individuals, supporting the need to meticulously examine therapies that aim to boost KBs. Practically, consideration of therapeutic ketosis may entail routine monitoring of levels to avoid risk for serious complications such as ketoacidosis, particularly when used in patients at high risk for diabetic ketoacidosis.

Journal of Cardiac Failure (2021). High credibility.

Causes of elevated or lower natriuretic peptide levels — Other than a primary diagnosis of HF, cardiovascular causes include acute coronary syndrome, MI; pulmonary embolism; myocarditis; hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; valvular heart disease; congenital heart disease; atrial or ventricular arrhythmias; heart contusion, cardiac infiltration or malignancy; cardioversion, ICD shock; pericardial disease; invasive or surgical procedures involving the heart; pulmonary hypertension, right ventricular failure; and infiltrative cardiomyopathies. Noncardiovascular causes include advanced age, kidney disease, critical illnesses including sepsis syndrome and cytokine syndrome, ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, pulmonary disease (pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), liver disease, severe anemia, and severe metabolic and hormone abnormalities (eg, thyrotoxicosis, diabetic ketoacidosis, severe burns). Causes of lower natriuretic peptide levels include obesity or increased BMI and pericardial disease, with the note that in certain patients with pericardial disease and effusion, natriuretic peptides may be lower and increase after pericardiocentesis.

### Clinical profile of diabetic ketoacidosis: a prospective study in a tertiary care hospital [^1174Euhp]. Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research (2015). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on diabetic ketoacidosis:

- **Definition**: DKA is an acute metabolic complication occurring mostly in patients with T1DM, characterized by a triad of hyperglycemia, ketosis, and acidemia.
- **Pathophysiology**: DKA is caused by absolute or relative insulin deficiency and increased levels of counterregulatory hormones, typically ocurring at the time of new diagnosis of untreated T1DM or due to inadequate insulin therapy, infection (such as pneumonia, UTI, sepsis), concomitant medications (corticosteroids, SGLT-2 inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, sympathomimetics, certain antipsychotics), illicit drug use, surgery, trauma, physiologic stress, or pregnancy.
- **Epidemiology**: The age-adjusted hospitalization rate for DKA in the US was estimated at 6.3% annually in 2014, with an in-hospital case fatality of 0.4%. The rate of hopsitalization for DKA per 10,000 admissions was reported as 53.4 in 2014 and 61.6 in 2017.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors include inconsistent caloric intake, poor medication adherence, poor glucose control, alcohol use, and dehydration.
- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, weakness, polydipsia, polyuria, dehydration, weight loss, polyphagia, fruity odor of breath, dyspnea, tachypnea, Kussmaul breathing, hypotension, tachycardia, and altered mental status. Laboratory findings in DKA include hyperglycemia, anion gap metabolic acidosis, and ketonemia/ketonuria.

Factors that predict MACE

Table 5 shows the contribution of clinical factors to risk for MACE following hospital discharge. Using multivariate logistic regression, a statistically significant relation was only found for an elevated admission serum cTnI, however pH also shows a strong trend toward influencing MACE. The other clinical factors listed in Table 5 do not show significant relationships with MACE. The odds ratio (OR) for pH demonstrates an increased risk of MACE for decreased levels of pH. Independent analysis of pH influence on MACE using univariate logistic regression identified a serum admission pH of less than 7.1 as statistically significant independent predictor for MACE.

Table 5
Multi-variable logistic regression for predicting MACE

Abbreviations: CAD = Coronary Artery Disease; CK-MB = Creatine Kinase – MB; Cardiac Troponin-I – cTnI.

Figure 3 shows a significant difference in event-free survival from MACE when comparing patients with and without elevated admission serum cTnI. The freedom from MACE is significantly lower in subjects who demonstrated elevated cTnI during hospitalization in the absence of evidence for an acute coronary syndrome.

### A mortality prediction model in diabetic ketoacidosis [^115pBoZP]. Clinical Endocrinology (2002). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Diabetic Ketoacidosis Mortality Prediction Model score (DKAMPM score)" for diabetic ketoacidosis.

The Diabetic Ketoacidosis Mortality Prediction Model score, abbreviated as DKAMPM score, is a clinical calculator used in the management of patients with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). This scoring system is specifically designed for adult patients diagnosed with DKA, a serious complication of diabetes that occurs when the body produces high levels of blood acids called ketones.

The DKAMPM score is utilized to predict the mortality risk in patients with DKA. It uses various clinical and laboratory parameters such as age, heart rate, systolic blood pressure, serum bicarbonate, blood urea nitrogen, and mental status to calculate the score. The higher the score, the higher the risk of mortality.

This calculator is not applicable to pediatric patients or to patients without a confirmed diagnosis of DKA. It should also not be used in isolation but in conjunction with clinical judgment and other diagnostic tools.

The Diabetic Ketoacidosis Mortality Prediction Model (DKAMPM) provides a systematic way to estimate the risk of in-hospital mortality for patients presenting with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). This model considers six specific clinical factors observed either at presentation or within the first day of hospitalization. Each factor is weighed based on its severity, contributing to a cumulative score that helps predict the patient's risk level.

Here's how the scoring system works:

1. Severe comorbidities at presentation, such as immunosuppression, previous myocardial infarction (MI), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cirrhosis, congestive heart failure, or previous stroke:

- **Yes**: 6 points
- **No**: 0 points

2. pH less than 7.0 at presentation:

- **Yes**: 4 points
- **No**: 0 points

3. Requirement of more than 50 international units (IU) of regular insulin after 12 hours:

- **Yes**: 4 points
- **No**: 0 points

4. Serum glucose level greater than 300 mg/dL (16.7 mmol/L) after 12 hours:

- **Yes**: 4 points
- **No**: 0 points

5. **Depressed mental state observed 24 hours after presentation**:

- **Yes**: 4 points
- **No**: 0 points

6. **Fever occurring after 24 hours of presentation**:

- **Yes**: 3 points
- **No**: 0 points

The total score, determined by adding up the points for all conditions that apply, falls between 0 and 25. The interpretation of the score is crucial for clinical decision-making and prioritizing care:

- A score ranging from 0 to 14 indicates a low risk, with a mortality probability of 0.86%.
- Scores between 15 and 18 suggest a moderate risk, translating to a 20.8% chance of in-hospital mortality.
- Scores from 19 to 25 highlight a high risk, with mortality rates escalating to 93.3%.

By utilizing these criteria, healthcare providers can stratify patients according to their risk level, enabling targeted interventions and better outcomes based on the predicted risks associated with DKA.

### Impact of clinical diagnosis of myocardial infarction in patients with elevated cardiac troponin [^1126VnzM]. Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This study demonstrates that the currently defined type 2 MI often is not recognised as MI in clinical practice. In both adjudicated type 2 MI and myocardial injury, a clinical diagnosis of MI at discharge was associated with increased cardiology care, including a greater use of coronary angiography and secondary preventive therapies. However, no prognostic effect of receiving a clinical diagnosis of MI could be observed for either of these conditions. This questions the clinical relevance of the term MI outside type 1 MI and highlights the need for further studies in both these heterogeneous conditions.

### Insulin human (Afrezza) [^116WRASi]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

5.6 Diabetic Ketoacidosis

In clinical trials enrolling patients with type 1 diabetes, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) was more common in AFREZZA-treated patients (0.43%; n = 13) than in comparator-treated patients (0.14%; n = 3). Patients with type 1 diabetes should always use AFREZZA in combination with basal insulin. In patients at risk for DKA, such as those with an acute illness or infection, increase the frequency of glucose monitoring and consider discontinuing AFREZZA and giving insulin using an alternate route of administration.

5.7 Hypersensitivity Reactions

Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur with insulin products, including AFREZZA.

If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue AFREZZA, treat per standard of care and monitor until symptoms and signs resolve [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. AFREZZA is contraindicated in patients who have had hypersensitivity reactions to AFREZZA or any of its excipients [see Contraindications (4)].

5.8 Hypokalemia

All insulin products, including AFREZZA, cause a shift in potassium from the extracellular to intracellular space, possibly leading to hypokalemia. Untreated hypokalemia may cause respiratory paralysis, ventricular arrhythmia, and death.

Monitor potassium levels in AFREZZA-treated patients at risk for hypokalemia (e.g., patients using potassium-lowering medications, patients taking medications sensitive to serum potassium concentrations and patients receiving intravenously administered insulin).

5.9 Fluid Retention and Heart Failure with Concomitant Use of PPAR-gamma Agonists

Thiazolidinediones (TZDs), which are peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma agonists, can cause dose-related fluid retention, particularly when used in combination with insulin. Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate heart failure.

Patients treated with insulin, including AFREZZA, and a PPAR-gamma agonist should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure. If heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care, and discontinuation or dose reduction of the PPAR-gamma agonist should be considered.

### Giant left pheochromocytoma with vascular anomalies and pelvic horseshoe kidney: a case report [^112JFjPS]. BMC Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 41 year-old Hispanic female with known uncomplicated type 2 diabetes mellitus for about 8 years treated with metformin presented to the emergency department with complaints of chest and abdominal pain, dyspnea, intractable nausea, and vomiting. She was in acute distress with tachycardia and hypertension, found to be in diabetic ketoacidosis, and diagnosed with an active COVID-19 infection prompting hospitalization. She was admitted to ICU and treated with continuous insulin infusion and IV fluids. She also acknowledged longstanding complaints of headaches, diaphoresis, and palpitations started several years ago prior to this presentation. Given chest pain at initial presentation, and elevated serum troponin level, she underwent further evaluation with CT chest, which revealed a 12 × 8 cm adrenal mass and a horseshoe kidney. The clinical diagnosis of pheochromocytoma was confirmed with elevated urine and serum metanephrine and noremetanephrine. Her diabetic ketoacidosis improved, and her COVID-19 infection was asymptomatic during her admission. She was discharged with long-acting insulin, and an alpha-blocker (terazosin), and the initial treatment plan was to proceed with resection of her adrenal mass. Nonetheless, her planned surgery was cancelled a few times due to patient's insurance problems, and incompliance with use of phenoxybenzamine.

### Mechanisms of diabetic cardiomyopathy: focus on inflammation [^111WqVTx]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

11.2 Assessment for diabetic cardiomyopathy using circulating biomarkers

Glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c): Elevated plasma levels of HbA1c are correlated with existing myocardial impairment in patients with T2D. However, the use of HbA1c as a marker of early detection of myocardial dysfunction in asymptomatic patients with T2D is limited.
Cardiac troponin: High‐sensitivity cardiac troponin has helped identify asymptomatic myocardial injury in individuals with T2D and predict progression to symptoms. Among the 9051 participants of the community‐based Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study in whom preexisting CVD was excluded, 11% of patients with T2D had increased high‐sensitivity cardiac troponin T (cTnT) (defined as ≥ 99th percentile of normal), the prevalence of increased cTnT being significantly higher in individuals with T2D versus those without (two‐ to three‐fold higher), the difference persisting after adjusting for other CV risk factors. In these patients, increased levels of cTnT were also strongly correlated with increased risk of incident HF and death.
Natriuretic peptides: Plasma levels of natriuretic peptides (B‐type natriuretic peptide [BNP] and N‐terminal pro–B‐type natriuretic peptides [NT‐proBNP]) reflect abnormal myocardial wall stress and have been integrated into the Universal Definition of HF. Natriuretic peptide levels are also used to define asymptomatic patients (i.e. pre‐HF or stage B) at higher risk of progression to symptomatic HF. Routine use of BNP or NT‐proBNP for HF screening in patients with or without T2D is supported by the most recent guidelines for the management of HF and endorsed by the American Diabetes Association/American College of Cardiology consensus statement. However, their use at large scales in clinical practice needs further optimization. In a recent analysis of 54 921 outpatients with T2D without overt HF identified in > 1000 US healthcare centers across the US, more than half (53%) had NT‐proBNP above 125 pg/mL, therefore meeting the definition of HF. Data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) further support this evidence, and in the CANagliflozin cardioVascular Assessment Study that recruited individuals with T2D and no known HF, 39.3% had NT‐proBNP ≥ 125 pg/mL. Finally, time‐dependent changes in natriuretic peptide levels have been suggested to be even more helpful for risk stratification for incident HF in individuals with T2D. In patients with T2D after recent acute coronary syndrome, the Examination of CV Outcomes with Alogliptin versus Standard of Care (EXAMINE) trial, two NT‐proBNP measurements at baseline and 6 months have identified various risk profiles according to the trajectory of change in NT‐proBNP levels over time (highest risk when both measures were elevated, rising risk when the 6‐month measurement was higher than baseline, and finally lower risk when follow‐up measurement was lower), reinforcing the role of serial measurements of natriuretic peptides in T2D as a relevant strategy for stratifying patients at risk of HF (Table 1).
Inflammatory biomarkers: In animal models of diabetic cardiomyopathy as well as in humans with T2D, plasma levels of proinflammatory mediators (TNFα, IL‐6 and CRP)and markers of fibrosis (TGFβ1 growth differentiation factor 15, soluble suppression of tumorigenesis‐2 [sST2])are increased, with a strong correlation between these markers. In individuals with high‐risk T2D, increased IL‐6 levels were associated with higher incident primary CV events (vs. those with low IL‐6). However, IL‐6 did not improve risk prediction beyond traditional risk factors in these patients. In the Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron Modified Release Controlled Evaluation study, biomarkers of inflammation (CRP, IL‐6 and fibrinogen) were associated with an increased risk of macrovascular events and death (adjustment made for age, sex and treatment groups) in individuals with high‐risk T2D (i.e. other CV risk factors but no overt HF). When adjusting for other CV risk factors, only IL‐6 remained significantly associated with clinical outcomes. Increased IL‐6 was also associated with endothelial dysfunction and LV diastolic dysfunction. As such, although consistently increasing in T2D, the biomarkers of inflammation failed to demonstrate a robust and independent role in the risk prediction of incident HF.
Novel biomarkers: Several other biomarkers have been studied in T2D, although none is routinely being used for the diagnosis or risk prediction of diabetic cardiomyopathy. Regardless, changes in these biomarker levels in patients with T2D are suggested to provide valuable pathophysiological insights. In diabetic cardiomyopathy, antioxidant markers, including leptin and adiponectin, are significantly decreased compared to individuals with no T2D, reinforcing the role of mitochondrial dysfunction and the ROS pathway in this setting. sST2, a marker of cardiac remodelling, is significantly increased and correlated with circulating levels of CRP in individuals with T2D.sST2 is even higher in individuals with T2D when LV diastolic dysfunction is present. Galactin‐3 and adiponectin, makers of fibrosis, are significantly elevated in T2Dand galactin‐3 was associated with myocardial longitudinal strain, an early marker of LV dysfunction in individuals with T2D.

### Pathophysiology of ketoacidosis in type 2 diabetes mellitus [^117YFLDR]. Diabetic Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Aims

Despite an increasing number of reports of ketoacidosis in populations with Type 2 diabetes mellitus, the pathophysiology of the ketoacidosis in these patients is unclear. We therefore tested the roles of three possible mechanisms: elevated stress hormones, increased free fatty acids (FFA), and suppressed insulin secretion.

Methods

Forty-six patients who presented to the Emergency Department with decompensated diabetes (serum glucose > 22.2 mmol/l and/or ketoacid concentrations ≥ 5 mmol/l), had blood sampled prior to insulin therapy. Three groups of subjects were studied: ketosis-prone Type 2 diabetes (KPDM2, n = 13) with ketoacidosis, non-ketosis-prone subjects with Type 2 diabetes (DM2, n = 15), and ketotic Type 1 diabetes (n = 18).

Results

All three groups had similar mean plasma glucose concentrations. The degree of ketoacidosis (plasma ketoacids, bicarbonate and anion gap) in Type 1 and 2 subjects was similar. Mean levels of counterregulatory hormones (glucagon, growth hormone, cortisol, epinephrine, norepinephrine), and FFA were not significantly different in DM2 and KPDM2 patients. In contrast, plasma C-peptide concentrations were approximately three-fold lower in KPDM2 vs. non-ketotic DM2 subjects (P = 0.0001). Type 1 ketotic subjects had significantly higher growth hormone (P = 0.024) and FFA (P < 0.002) and lower glucagon levels (P < 0.02) than DM2.

Conclusions

At the time of hospital presentation, the predominant mechanism for ketosis in KPDM2 is likely to be greater insulinopenia.

### A case of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy induced by accidental hypothermia and diabetic ketoacidosis [^113ia7Yn]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is known to be triggered by some stress. We report the first case of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy induced by hypothermia and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). A 59-year-old woman was brought to our emergency department. Upon examination, she was found to be lethargic and disoriented. The body temperature was 30.9°C, blood pressure was 86/68 mm Hg, blood glucose level was 1018 mg/dl. Urinalysis revealed the presence of ketones and arterial blood gas analysis revealed pH 6.87. She was diagnosed with DKA and accidental hypothermia. An ECG demonstrated a J wave (V(4–5)) and ST-segment elevation (V(3–5)), and an ultrasound cardiogram revealed contractile failure of the left ventricular wall at the apex with hypercontraction of the basal segment. Coronary artery disease was ruled out by coronary angiography, and the diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy was confirmed. Physicians should keep in mind that Takotsubo cardiomyopathy can be induced by accidental hypothermia and DKA.

### First-time diabetic ketoacidosis in type 2 diabetics with COVID-19 infection: a novel case series [^1146Lddn]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is a novel coronavirus first diagnosed in U.S. hospitals in January 2020. Typical presenting symptoms include fever, dry cough, dyspnea, and hypoxia. However, several other symptoms have been reported, including fatigue, weakness, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. We have identified a series of patients with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) likely precipitated by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Case Series

We describe 5 patients with previously known type 2 diabetes and no history of DKA, who presented to the emergency department with new-onset DKA and COVID-19. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Diabetes mellitus is a known risk factor for poor outcomes in viral respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19. Infection may precipitate DKA in patients with type 2 diabetes. Aggressive management of these patients is recommended; however, management guidelines have not yet been put forth for this unique subset of patients.

### SGLT-2i associated diabetic ketoacidosis in the setting of cardiogenic shock [^112UGuoA]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a life-threatening complication of diabetes mellitus. Sodium-glucose co-transport inhibitors (SGLT-2i), a treatment for type 2 diabetes, have demonstrated a survival benefit in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Many patients with HFrEF have been started on SGLT-2i and sometimes transitioned off insulin due to improved glycaemic control. SGLT-2i have demonstrated an association with DKA. Here, we present a case of simultaneous cardiogenic shock and DKA in the setting of recent transition from insulin to an SGLT-2i. DKA in conjunction with decompensated heart failure is a combination that will likely occur more frequently as SGLT-2i use becomes more widespread in patients with HFrEF, and its identification and management require special considerations. Volume status, potassium management and recognition of DKA in these patients must be approached differently than in other cases of DKA.

### Immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced Takotsubo syndrome and diabetic ketoacidosis: rare reactions [^11245kCV]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

Our patient had a classic presentation of TS. A literature review of TS found that an emotional or physical stress is present as the trigger in 39% and 35% of patients, respectively. Having excluded acute coronary syndrome, myocarditis and physical and emotional stress in conjunction with the observation that two sequential episodes of TS followed the same dual ICI therapy confirms the observation that TS was secondary to ipilimumab and nivolumab treatment.

Historically TS has been considered a benign condition with a favourable prognosis. Recent data shows that indeed TS secondary to emotional triggers has a favourable outcome compared with CAD, however overall TS has comparable mortality outcomes to age-controlled patients with CAD. TS secondary to a physical trigger has a worse 5-year mortality than CAD, likely due to the underlying comorbid state of the patient population.

There have been reports in the literature of TS secondary to ICIs and a proportionality study found that there was an increased OR of TS when compared with positive and negative controls. The precise pathophysiology of TS in the setting of ICIs is unclear and imaging studies have not consistently shown myocardial oedema. The proposed mechanism of injury in ICI-induced myocarditis is lymphocyte (CD4+ and CD8+ T cells) and macrophage infiltration of the myocardium. There has also been a case report of lymphocytic myocarditis mimicking TS, which may imply that some of these cases are atypical myocarditis. The lack of gadolidium enhancement and myocardial oedema in our patient is consistent with the previously published case reports, suggesting that ICIs can cause TS without myocarditis.

Our literature review revealed no case reports of ICI-induced euglycaemic or hyperglycaemic DKA in the setting of concurrent SGLT2 inhibitor. However, considering our patient's hyperglycaemia and his significant ketoacidotic state, it is possible that SGLT2 inhibitor therapy contributed to the metabolic disturbance in the setting of ICI, and it remains unknown whether this is an atypical manifestation of euglycaemic DKA. ICI-induced diabetes (type 1) has been reportedwith an estimated incidence of 1%and approximately 76% of new cases present with DKA. Our patient had established type 2 diabetes.

### Pasireotide (Signifor LAR) [^113cL3zm]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.1 Hyperglycemia, Diabetes, and Ketoacidosis

SIGNIFOR LAR can cause increases in blood glucose levels which are sometimes severe. There have been postmarketing cases of ketoacidosis with SIGNIFOR LAR in patients with history of diabetes and in patients without history of diabetes.

In the acromegalic patient study, 5 patients naïve to drug therapy treated with SIGNIFOR LAR (2 of whom were normoglycemic at baseline) and none in the active comparator group were hospitalized for hyperglycemia (blood glucose range 359–506 mg/dL). Two additional patients who had received active comparator in the main trial and were switched to SIGNIFOR LAR in the extension trial, were hospitalized for elevated glucose levels while on SIGNIFOR LAR; one of those patients developed diabetic ketoacidosis. In the Cushing's disease study, 2 patients were hospitalized for elevated blood glucose.

In clinical studies for acromegaly and Cushing's disease, SIGNIFOR LAR caused an increase in the incidence of diabetes and prediabetes. A majority of patients, including those with normal glucose tolerance, prediabetes and diabetes, experienced increased glucose levels within the first 3 months of treatment [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In the drug-naïve acromegaly study, the prevalence of diabetes increased from 30% at baseline to 60% at Month 12. In the study evaluating acromegaly patients previously treated with somatostatin analogs, the prevalence of diabetes increased from 71% at baseline to 87% at Month 6 in patients treated with SIGNIFOR LAR 40 mg, and from 60% to 84% in patients treated with SIGNIFOR LAR 60 mg. In the Cushing's disease study, the prevalence of diabetes increased from 40% at baseline to 56% at Month 12.

### Euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis in the era of SGLT-2 inhibitors [^116v1qa5]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2023). High credibility.

Pathophysiology

The mechanism of DKA is well characterized as a clinical state of relative or absolute insulin deficiency and an excessive counter-regulatory hormone response including glucagon, growth hormone, catecholamines, and corticosteroids. Conversely, our understanding of the mechanisms that contribute to EDKA is more limited. An early theory suggested that EDKA may be attributed to a low renal threshold for glucosuria in the presence of an increased rate of gluconeogenesis and free fatty acid metabolism. Recent studies have expanded on this idea. SGLT-2 inhibitors increase renal clearance of glucose by inhibiting reabsorption at the SGLT-2 transporters in the renal proximal tubular epithelium. Hepatic glucogenesis is increased at lower insulin dosing with augmentation of urinary glucose losses with SGLT-2 inhibitors(figure 1).

Figure 1
Pathophysiological mechanisms leading to EDKA. EDKA, euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis; DKA, diabetic ketoacidosis; SGLT-2, sodium-glucose transporter type 2.

Through unclear mechanisms, glucagon levels are elevated in the setting of SGLT-2 inhibitor use. Upregulated glucagon activity favors ketogenesis.SGLT-2 inhibitors promote a negative fluid and sodium balance. This exacerbates the hypovolemic state of DKA, leading to elevated cortisol, epinephrine, and glucagon levels, which in turn further enhance insulin resistance, ketogenesis, and lipolysis. A recent study has shown an increase in norepinephrine turnover in response to SGLT-2 inhibitor use that can increase hepatic glucose production independent of changes in insulin and glucagon.

### Advances in cardiovascular pharmacotherapy. IV. sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 inhibitors, part 2: mechanisms for myocardial protection, adverse effects, and perioperative implications [^113JWnY2]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

This second part of a two-part review on the cardiovascular pharmacology of sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) describes the mechanisms that have been proposed to explain how these drugs improve outcomes in heart failure and myocardial infarction and discusses their adverse effects and perioperative implications for patients with or without diabetes undergoing major surgery. The mechanism(s) by which SGLT2i exert beneficial cardiovascular actions are incompletely understood at present, but they are most likely multifactorial in origin, as no single factor has been proven definitive when considered alone. SGLT2i increase the risk of genital mycotic infections and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in patients with diabetes, but the drugs do not cause severe hypoglycemia requiring intervention, urinary tract infection, hypovolemia, or acute kidney injury, among other postulated adverse outcomes. Perioperative euglycemic DKA (euDKA) is rare, but vigilance for its occurrence is required when an anion gap metabolic acidosis develops despite normal or only modestly elevated glucose concentration. Current guidelines recommend withholding SGLT2i for at least 48 hours to minimize the risk of DKA before elective major surgery in patients with but not without diabetes. The guidelines further emphasize the need to maintain a high index of suspicion for DKA and euDKA when SGLT2i therapy cannot be stopped because of urgent or emergent surgery so that appropriate treatment can be promptly initiated to prevent morbidity and mortality.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

SGLT2i — perioperative management: SGLT2i must be discontinued 3 to 4 days before surgery, with euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis defined as normoglycemia (blood glucose < 250 mg/dL) in the presence of metabolic acidosis (pH < 7.3), total decreased serum bicarbonate (< 18 mEq/L), and elevated serum and urine ketones; there are no clear guidelines regarding restarting SGLT2i after surgery and ideally they should not be recommended until the patient is clinically stable and has resumed a normal diet.

### Association between troponin-I levels and outcome in critically ill patients admitted to non-cardiac intensive care unit with high prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors [^112cyth5]. BMC Anesthesiology (2018). Low credibility.

Another difference is that Lim et al. systematic review suggested an association between troponin elevation and length of ICU stay, while our study did not demonstrate such an association.

Our study indicated a level-dependent association of troponin-I elevation with hospital mortality in patients who were less than 50 years of age, those not on vasopressors, and who were non-diabetics. These findings are surprising and may, at first, appear to be counterintuitive. Interestingly, these findings are consistent with studies that showed no association between troponin-I and mortality in patients admitted to ICU with sepsis and in elderly ill patients presenting to the Emergency Department. The observed increased mortality in patients who were less than 50 years of age and non-diabetics is consistent with the findings of Lim and Whitlock which showed that patients with elevated troponin levels for other than myocardial infarction had a worse outcome compared to those who did have myocardial infarction; with diabetes and old age being two of the most significant risk factors for myocardial infarction. Although our study did not distinguish between elevated troponin-I levels caused by myocardial infarction or due to other known causes of troponin-I elevation (e.g. sepsis, hypovolemic shock, pulmonary embolism or inflammatory mediator related myocardial cell injury), it is plausible that it takes a significant injury to the myocardium in patients with lower cardiovascular risk such as those who are young patients, not on vasopressors and non-diabetics, to cause troponin-I elevation compared to patients with higher cardiovascular risk factors such as older patients, on vasopressors and with diabetes. This finding needs further validation in future studies. Based on current data, troponin measurement in critically ill patients may have prognostic value, but whether it can guide specific therapeutic interventions remains unknown and will need to be tested in randomized controlled trial.

### Empagliflozin-associated postoperative mixed metabolic acidosis. case report and review of pathogenesis [^1145nXT2]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis associated with SGLT2 inhibitors is a rare, relatively new and potentially fatal clinical entity, characterized by metabolic acidosis with normal or only moderately elevated glycemia. The mechanisms are not fully understood but involve increased ketogenesis and complex renal metabolic dysfunction, resulting in both ketoacidosis and hyperchloremic acidosis. We report a rare case of fatal empagliflozin-associated acidosis with profound hyperchloremia and review its pathogenesis.

Case Presentation

A patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with empagliflozin underwent an elective hip replacement surgery. Since day 4 after surgery, he felt generally unwell, leading to cardiac arrest on the day 5. Empagliflozin-associated euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis with severe hyperchloremic acidosis was identified as the cause of the cardiac arrest.

Conclusions

This unique case documents the possibility of severe SGLT2 inhibitor-associated mixed metabolic acidosis with a predominant hyperchloremic component. Awareness of this possibility and a high index of suspicion are crucial for correct and early diagnosis.

### EACTS / STS / AATS guidelines on temporary mechanical circulatory support in adult cardiac surgery [^113F6RyV]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Diabetes mellitus (DM) in cardiogenic shock (CS) on temporary mechanical circulatory support (tMCS) — DM should not be considered a contraindication to tMCS, and although one group found DM was associated with higher 30-day mortality, no difference was observed in 1-year mortality, all-cause mortality, device-related infections, or ischaemic/haemorrhagic stroke. Hyperglycaemia is common, with 56% of 393 patients supported with mAFP or extracorporeal life support (ECLS) having a blood glucose level > 140 mg/dL, and patients with significantly abnormal glucose at veno-arterial extracorporeal life support (VA-ECLS) cannulation — either > 400 mg/dL or < 80 mg/dL — were associated with worse outcomes compared to normoglycaemia or moderate hyperglycaemia. Due to the high prevalence of peripheral vascular disease (PVD) in DM, clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for vascular pathology, and patients with long-standing or poorly controlled DM are at increased risk of microvascular disease and impaired wound healing, which may complicate cannulation. Early glucose optimization protocols may improve outcomes in patients with tMCS; however, future studies should determine whether improved glycaemic control independently contributes to better clinical outcomes. Diabetic ketoacidosis may occur in both type 1 and type 2 DM and can lead to severe electrolyte and metabolic disturbances, potentially precipitating cardiac arrest or stress-induced cardiomyopathy; case reports support the use of VA-ECLS in diabetic ketoacidosis-associated cardiomyopathy, suggesting that it may be a reasonable option in selected cases.

### Alcoholic ketoacidosis: confused diagnosis [^1171Hoe2]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

A woman in her 30s presented with a 3-day history of nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. She was found to be in ketoacidosis with an elevated serum glucose level of 18.2mmol/L (328mg/dL). Based on her initial presentation and test results, she was believed to have new onset diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) from previously undiagnosed diabetes. Subsequently, she was found to have acidosis caused by acute or chronic alcohol consumption, even though her serum glucose was higher than would be typically expected with alcohol abuse. Alcoholic ketoacidosis usually has lower glucose levels as well as retained mental function when compared with DKA. A haemoglobin A1c, fructosamine level, betahydroxybutyrate to acetoacetate ratio, C-peptide and antibodies to pancreatic beta-cells can help rule out diabetes as the aetiology of the ketoacidosis. This patient was treated with fluids and electrolyte replacement, showed rapid improvement, received alcohol cessation resources and was discharged home.

### Interpreting troponin elevations: do we need multiple diagnoses? [^117AFCsq]. European Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Despite these problems in clinical decision-making and patient management, this case illustrates the advantages to having the diagnosis of TYPE 2 MI available. In discussing the Universal Definition for MI, the joint commission discussed the importance of also defining the extent or severity of the MI. Based on the relatively small rise in troponin and non-specific abnormalities on ECG, the amount of cardiac damage in this patient was felt to be small, and additional imaging studies to confirm that assessment were deferred. But the term TYPE 2 MI is still applicable, even though we may qualify the diagnosis using appropriate modifiers (such as possible or probable) with the recognition that the diagnosis may be confirmed, excluded, or further refined, depending on further studies.

The Diagnosis of TYPE 2 MI is advantageous not only for documentation purposes, but can also assist in quality review programs. Criteria for optimal care of acute MI often include measures such as time from onset of symptoms to first medical contact, time to first ECG, time from initial diagnosis to cardiac consultation, or time from diagnosis to lytic therapy, arrival in the catheterization lab, or reperfusion. Such measures are meaningless in patients such as the one presented here, and using an alternate diagnosis will prevent misclassification of the event.

### Ertugliflozin (Steglatro) [^113xEVuL]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Consider ketone monitoring in patients at risk for ketoacidosis if indicated by the clinical situation. Assess for ketoacidosis regardless of presenting blood glucose levels in patients who present with signs and symptoms consistent with severe metabolic acidosis. If ketoacidosis is suspected, discontinue STEGLATRO, promptly evaluate, and treat ketoacidosis, if confirmed. Monitor patients for resolution of ketoacidosis before restarting STEGLATRO.

Withhold STEGLATRO, if possible, in temporary clinical situations that could predispose patients to ketoacidosis. Resume STEGLATRO when the patient is clinically stable and has resumed oral intake [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

Educate all patients on the signs and symptoms of ketoacidosis and instruct patients to discontinue STEGLATRO and seek medical attention immediately if signs and symptoms occur.

5.2 Lower Limb Amputation

In a long-term cardiovascular outcomes study [see Clinical Studies (14.2)], in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and established cardiovascular disease, the occurrence of non-traumatic lower limb amputations was reported with event rates of 4.7, 5.7, and 6.0 events per 1,000 patient-years in the placebo, STEGLATRO 5 mg, and STEGLATRO 15 mg treatment arms, respectively.

Amputation of the toe and foot were most frequent (81 out of 109 patients with lower limb amputations). Some patients had multiple amputations, some involving both lower limbs.

Lower limb infections, gangrene, and diabetic foot ulcers were the most common precipitating medical events leading to the need for an amputation. Patients with amputations were more likely to be male, have higher A1C (%) at baseline, have a history of peripheral arterial disease, amputation or peripheral revascularization procedure, diabetic foot, and to have been taking diuretics or insulin.

Across seven STEGLATRO clinical trials, non-traumatic lower limb amputations were reported in 1 (0.1%) patient in the comparator group, 3 (0.2%) patients in the STEGLATRO 5 mg group, and 8 (0.5%) patients in the STEGLATRO 15 mg group.

Counsel patients about the importance of routine preventative foot care. Monitor patients receiving STEGLATRO for signs and symptoms of infection (including osteomyelitis), new pain or tenderness, sores or ulcers involving the lower limbs, and discontinue STEGLATRO if these complications occur.

### Circulating cardiac biomarkers in diabetes mellitus: a new dawn for risk stratification – A narrative review [^112ovWYR]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Cardiac Troponins

Cardiac troponins are established biomarkers of myocardial injury and necrosis, and, even below the 99th percentile, they strongly predict adverse outcomes in prediabetes and T2DM patients. There is evidence showing that patients with prediabetes and T2DM may develop asymptomatic myocardial damage beyond obvious ischemic causes. The primary causes that lead to increased permeability of cell membranes, leakage of a cytoplasmic pool of cardiac troponins and onset of small-sized myocardial necrosis in prediabetes and diabetes patients are lipotoxicity and myocardial steatosis, which influence the biomechanical myocardial stress, low-grade inflammation, oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress and mitochondrial stress, altered reparation due to the metabolic memory phenomenon and impaired intracellular metabolism.

Micro- and macro-vasculopathies in prediabetes and diabetes are associated with accelerating atherosclerosis, plaque shaping, development of endothelial dysfunction and microvascular obstruction, which induce diabetes-related cardiomyopathy. However, a T2DM-induced significant decrease in sirtuin-1 and hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α expression in the myocardium as well as declining circulating levels of orexin B may contribute to ischemia-reperfusion injury and exacerbate the cardiac and vascular dysfunctions.

### Association between troponin-I levels and outcome in critically ill patients admitted to non-cardiac intensive care unit with high prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors [^113Rxyv5]. BMC Anesthesiology (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Our study indicates that troponin-I elevation demonstrates a significant level-dependent association with hospital mortality in critically ill patients. As such, it may be used in conjunction with other measures as well clinical expertise to help clinicians prognosticating critically ill patients, as is currently done for troponin elevation in acute coronary syndromes. Furthermore, we identified three subgroups of patients who were at increased risk of hospital mortality with troponin-I elevation: patients less than 50 years of age, non-diabetics and patients not on vasopressors. Further research needed to validate this differential association of troponin-I elevation and outcome by age, diabetes and vasopressor use. In addition, clinical trial to investigate the effect of therapeutic interventions in critically ill patients with troponin-I levels on outcomes.

### Euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis with elevated acetone in a patient taking a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor [^112pt6Sb]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor medications are a class of antihyperglycemic agents that increase urinary glucose excretion by interfering with the reabsorption of glucose in the proximal renal tubules. In May of 2015, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration released a warning concerning a potential increased risk of ketoacidosis and ketosis in patients taking these medications.

Case Report

We present a case of a 57-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes mellitus taking a combination of canagliflozin and metformin who presented with progressive altered mental status over the previous 2 days. Her work-up demonstrated a metabolic acidosis with an anion gap of 38 and a venous serum pH of 7.08. The serum glucose was 168 mg/dL. The urinalysis showed glucose > 500 mg/dL and ketones of 80 mg/dL. Further evaluation demonstrated an elevated serum osmolality of 319 mOsm/kg and an acetone concentration of 93 mg/dL. She was treated with intravenous insulin and fluids, and the metabolic abnormalities and her altered mental status resolved within 36 h. This was the first episode of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) for this patient. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Diabetic patients on SGLT2 inhibitor medications are at risk for ketoacidosis. Due to the renal glucose-wasting properties of these drugs, they may present with ketoacidosis with only mild elevations in serum glucose, potentially complicating the diagnosis. Acetone is one of the three main ketone bodies formed during DKA and it may be present at considerable concentrations, contributing to the serum osmolality.

### Incidence and outcomes of non-ST elevation myocardial infarction in patients hospitalized with decompensated diabetes [^111QSVV4]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Single center studies suggested that non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) in patients admitted with acute decompensated diabetes is associated with poor long-term prognosis. We hypothesize that acute decompensated diabetes is also associated with worse early morbidity and mortality in patients admitted with NSTEMI. Adult patients with a primary discharge diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS) were identified in the national inpatient sample. We then assessed contemporary trends in the incidence and management patents of NSTEMI in patients admitted with DKA/HHS and compared in-hospital morbidity and mortality, resource utilization, and cost between DKA/HHS patients with and without NSTEMI. In 431,037 patients admitted with decompensated diabetes from 2003 to 2014, 13,069 (3.03%) suffered a NSTEMI during their hospitalization. Patients with NSTEMI were older and had higher prevalence of atherosclerotic and nonatherosclerotic comorbidities. After propensity score matching, NSTEMI was associated with a 60% increase in in-hospitalmortality (9.1% vs 5.5%; p < 0.001), higher incidences of stroke, acute kidney injury, blood transfusion, longer hospitalizations, and higher costs. A minority (35%) ofNSTEMI patients underwent invasive coronary assessment, and those had lower in-hospitalmortality compared with NSTEMI patients who did not undergo invasive assessment(3.3% vs 12.2%, adjusted OR 0.30, 95%CI 0.24 to 0.36, p < 0.001). About 3% of patients admitted with decompensated diabetes suffer a NSTEMI and those experience higher in-hospital morbidity and mortality, longer hospitalization, and higher cost.

Hyperglycemic emergencies (diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar state) — protocols and safety — should follow standardized protocols with aggressive fluid resuscitation, electrolytes replacement, and also insulin therapy, with caution recommended in persons with advanced renal failure because standard IV fluid and insulin replacement may result in increased volume overload and hypoglycemia; severe hypokalemia (K < 2.5 mEq/L) and severe hypoglycemia (BG < 40 mg/dl) have been associated with increased mortality; the addition of noninsulin agents, such as DPP-4 inhibitors or GLP-1 RAs, before admission or during the postoperative period, has not reduced rates of stress hyperglycemia and may increase nausea and vomiting rates among critically ill persons.

### Effect of hypoglycaemia on measures of myocardial blood flow and myocardial injury in adults with and without type 1 diabetes: a prospective, randomised, open-label, blinded endpoint, cross-over study [^113XAdhu]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

A Danish study using non‐invasive cardiac magnetic resonance imaging has reported that myocardial blood flow reserve was higher at rest and lower during vasodilatory stress in people with type 2 diabetes compared with non‐diabetic controls. Impaired myocardial blood flow reserve was associated with microvascular complications (albuminuria and retinopathy) of diabetes. The present study explicitly excluded people with overt microvascular disease; it is possible that the development of cardiac microangiopathy may underlie an abnormal response to hypoglycaemia in type 1 diabetes.

While no change in the highly sensitive troponin values was observed during acute hypoglycaemia, this was measured in close temporal proximity to the blood glucose nadir. It is possible that measurement in the immediate 'recovery' stage was made too early to detect a rise in plasma troponin and exclude evidence of myocardial insult.

The results of the present study imply that any putative cardiac harm of hypoglycaemia is unlikely to be mediated solely through coronary vasomotor dysfunction. Other potentially harmful factors associated with hypoglycaemia may be required, such as the promotion of pro‐thrombotic mechanisms, endothelial abnormalities, or altered cardiac electrical conduction. It should also be noted that this study specifically studied acute hypoglycaemia, and the cumulative effects of recurrent hypoglycaemia have not been examined.

Recent randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that did not target strict glycaemic control but used drugs with a low risk of hypoglycaemia have shown beneficial cardiovascular outcomes. This is in direct contrast to previous RCTs, in which very strict glycaemic control was pursued and the incidence of severe hypoglycaemia was high. These findings suggest that avoidance of hypoglycaemia is important to achieve cardiovascular benefit.

### Hyperlactatemia in diabetic ketoacidosis [^113unzFj]. Diabetic Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Aims

The study examined the prevalence and degree of lactate elevation in diabetic ketoacidosis, and explored which biochemical abnormalities predicted L-lactate levels.

Methods

We reviewed episodes of diabetic ketoacidosis from 79 diabetes patients (one episode per patient). Separate univariate linear regression models were specified to predict lactate level from each of nine biochemical variables. Significant predictors from the univariate models were included in a final multivariate linear regression model to predict lactate levels.

Results

Mean (SD) lactate level was 3.05 (1.66) mmol/L; about 65% of patients had lactate levels > 2 mmol/L. In the final multivariate linear regression model (R 2 = 0.45), higher lactate levels were associated with greater hydrogen ion concentration (standardised β = .60, t = 4.16, p < 0.0001), higher blood glucose (standardised β = .28, t = 2.67, p = 0.009) and lower glomerular filtration rate estimated from creatinine (standardised β = -.23, t = 2.29, p = 0.025). Bicarbonate, beta-hydroxybutyrate, body mass index, mean arterial pressure and calculated osmolality were not significant predictors of lactate level. There were three distinct patterns of lactate levels with treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis: group 1 = gradual decline, group 2 = initial increase and then decline and group 3 = initial decline followed by a transient peak and subsequent decline.

Conclusions

Elevated lactate level is the norm in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis. Higher blood glucose levels and higher hydrogen ion concentrations are related to greater lactate. With treatment, there are different patterns of decline in lactate levels.

### High-sensitivity cardiac troponin and the universal definition of myocardial infarction [^115ZaBH4]. Circulation (2020). Medium credibility.

The lack of a specific cardiac biomarker to distinguish type 1 myocardial infarction and the increasing frequency of type 2 myocardial infarction and myocardial injury poses challenges to clinicians in practice on a daily basis. As observed in this trial, type 2 myocardial infarction and myocardial injury are responsible for almost half of all elevations in cardiac troponin concentration, and have been shown to be more frequent than type 1 myocardial infarction in hospitalized patients over the age of 75. Less than half of these patients are referred to cardiology, with the majority managed by general physicians, and a lack of evidence has led to inconsistency in investigation and treatment.

The classification of type 2 myocardial infarction and myocardial injury is based on expert consensus, and to date no prospective clinical trials have evaluated the utility of this classification. These conditions arise because of a wide range of pathologies including coronary or structural heart disease, arrhythmias, myocarditis, and many noncardiac conditions. The latest guidance, requiring evidence of myocardial ischemia and oxygen supply-demand imbalance, has reduced the frequency of type 2 myocardial infarction. Our observations add to previous studies suggesting that any myocardial injury is prognostically important, irrespective of whether myocardial ischemia was present, but strategies to guide further investigation and treatment in patients without type 1 myocardial infarction require prospective evaluation.

### Hyperosmolar diabetic ketoacidosis – review of literature and the shifting paradigm in evaluation and management [^111JLwwY]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Hyperosmolar diabetic ketoacidosis (H-DKA), a distinct clinical entity, is the overlap of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS).

Aim

We describe the clinical presentation, metabolic aberrations, and associated morbidity/mortality of these cases with H-DKA. We highlight the problem areas of medical care which require particular attention when caring for pediatric diabetes patients presenting with H-DKA.

Methods

In our study we reviewed the literature back to 1963 and retrieved twenty-four cases meeting the criteria of H-DKA: glucose > 600 mg/dL, pH < 7.3, bicarbonate < 15 mEq/L, and serum osmolality > 320 mOsm/kg, while adding three cases from our institution.

Results

Average age of presentation of H-DKA was 10.2 years ± 4.5 years in females and 13.3 years ± 4 years in males, HbA1c was 13%. Biochemical parameters were consistent with severe dehydration: serum osmolality = 394.8 ± 55 mOsm/kg, BUN = 48 ± 22 mg/dL, creatinine = 2.81 ± 1.03 mg/dL. Acute kidney injury, present in 12 cases, was the most frequent end-organ complication.

Conclusion

Multi-organ involvement with AKI, rhabdomyolysis, pancreatitis, neurological and cardiac issues such as arrhythmias, are common in H-DKA. Aggressive fluid management, insulin therapy and supportive care can prevent acute and long term adverse outcomes in children and adolescents.

The issue of the evaluation of biomarkers meaning in diabetes

Several biomarkers have been suggested to be helpful in stratification of the risk during the COVID-19. Their value as helpful tools in the case of COVID-19 in people with diabetes needs a careful evaluation.

Biomarkers of cardiovascular disease and heart failure

COVID-19 can cause serious acute cardiovascular events. Moreover, people with a previous cardiovascular disease are more prone to a worse prognosis if affected by SARS-CoV-2. A pre-existing cardiovascular disease very often accompanies diabetes, therefore, people with diabetes also for this reason may be exposed to a more serious complication when having the COVID-19. Furthermore, a large proportion of people with diabetes has asymptomatic coronary artery disease which can increase the risk of acute coronary syndrome, heart failure and arrhythmia during the COVID-19 due to proinflammatory process, hypercoagulability and sympathetic stimulation. QT interval is also often increased in people with diabetes, as a consequence of cardiac autonomic neuropathy. QT interval may be further lengthened by hypoglycemia and by drugs used during the COVID-19 and by hypokalemia and needs to be carefully monitored.

Hs-troponin has been suggested for monitoring the risk of myocardial infarction during the COVID-19. However, in the case of diabetes, increased levels of hs-troponin have been reported, as signal of an existing chronic heart damage, therefore its use for monitoring heart risk in diabetes during COVID-19 deserves some caution.

The situation is not different for heart failure, which again, has been described as a serious complication of COVID-19. The measurement of the "N-Terminal-pro-Brain Natriuretic-Peptide" (NT-proBNP) to define the risk for heart failure in COVID-19 has been suggested. However, plasma NT-proBNP level in a patient with COVID-19 must be seen as a marker of both the presence and extent of pre-existing cardiac disease and the acute haemodynamic stress related to COVID-19. As for hs-troponin, increased levels of NT-proBNP have been often reported in diabetes. According to various studies, an asymptomatic heart failure can be present in up to more than 50% of people with diabetes. This condition is characterized by an increase of plasma NT-proBNP. So, again, the usefulness of a marker, in this case the NT-proBNP, needs a careful evaluation in the presence of diabetes and COVID-19.

### 2020 expert consensus decision pathway on novel therapies for cardiovascular risk reduction in patients with type 2 diabetes: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^113bzp94]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

SGLT2 inhibitor monitoring — patients starting an SGLT2 inhibitor should be informed about the "higher risk of genital mycotic infections" and that careful perineal hygiene may lower risk; "Topical antifungal agents can be used" and treatment "may require temporary discontinuation of the SGLT2 inhibitor", while "Oral antifungals can be used but require close attention to corrected QT interval (QTc)". Counsel on diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) risk and symptoms; "Home monitoring with urine ketone test strips may be a reasonable choice in some higher-risk patients", and to prevent DKA "avoid initial reductions in total daily insulin dose of > 20%". Recognize that "Approximately 5% to 10% of adult-onset diabetes is late-onset type 1", who have increased DKA risk and no CV outcomes data. For those "taking insulin or an insulin secretagogue", advise on hypoglycemia risk and that "discontinuing or weaning the sulfonylurea or glinide or modestly reducing total daily insulin dose by up to 20% could reduce the risk", with instruction to self-monitor glucose "during the first 3 to 4 weeks". In patients not on insulin or a secretagogue, "the risk of hypoglycemia is not significantly increased". Advise that a diuretic effect "may be observed", additive with loop diuretics; monitor for volume depletion and "decreasing the diuretic dose may be warranted" if symptoms occur. Kidney considerations include that therapy "may cause a modest initial decrease in eGFR", yet trials show "no increase in acute kidney injury", and "Monitoring renal function in the first few weeks of therapy is reasonable, particularly in patients with impaired renal function at baseline".

### Acute kidney injury and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T levels in the ED… [^112LxJKN]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Question What are the clinical implications of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T measurements in patients with acute kidney injury. Findings In this cohort study of 15 111 emergency department visits by 13 638 patients with AKI, hs-cTnT concentrations indicative of acute myocardial injury were evident in almost 1 of 3 visits without myocardial infarction. In addition, hs-cTnT–based algorithms for identifying patients at high risk for MI. showed poor performance. Meaning Findings of this study suggest that dynamic hs-cTnT concentrations are commonly observed in patients with AKI, limiting the clinical accuracy for MI, and highlights the need for novel hs-cTn–based approaches to increase specificity for MI among this patient population. Importance The clinical implications of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T measurements in patients with acute kidney injury in the emergency department are largely unknown.

High-sensitivity cardiac troponin elevations associated with both underlying structural cardiac and kidney disease are commonly observed in patients with CKD and are strongly associated with increased risk of future cardiovascular events and mortality. 8, 9, 31–34 The exact cause of elevated cTnT in patients with decreased kidney function is controversial. elevated and dynamic cTnT in AKI, including those leading to acute ischemic myocardial injury in conditions with myocardial oxygen supply and demand mismatch indicative of a type 2 MI, and those related to conditions associated with acute nonischemic myocardial injury. 4, 38 The effect of reduced kidney cTnT clearance in AKI is so far unexplored, but probably depends on the AKI phenotype and the clinical setting.

Future research should focus on underlying plausible mechanistic concepts, which subsequently would clarify the magnitude of cTnT elevation and kinetic change that could be explained by changes in kidney function in association with concurrent AKI-induced ischemic or nonischemic cardiomyocyte injury. Such clarification would ultimately help to improve cardiovascular risk stratification and preventive treatment strategies. In this cohort study, we found that elevated and dynamic hs-cTnT concentrations indicative of acute myocardial injury are common among patients with AKI in the ED and are associated with dynamic changes in SCr. This finding was reflected by a low clinical accuracy of guideline-recommended hs-cTnT cutoff criteria for MI in patients presenting with chest pain to the ED with concurrent AKI.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis… [^115yTEZQ]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

Many patients with diabetes die from diabetic ketoacidosis every year. DKA is caused by reduced insulin levels, decreased glucose use, and increased gluconeogenesis from elevated counter regulatory hormones, including catecholamines, glucagon, and cortisol. DKA primarily affects patients with type 1 diabetes, but also may occur in patients with type 2 diabetes, and is most often caused by omission of treatment, infection, or alcohol abuse. 1 Use of a standard protocol provides consistent results in treating DKA. 2 An evidence-based guideline for the management of DKA from the American Diabetes Association is the basis for much of this article.
3. SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS DKA can develop in less than 24 hours. 3 Metabolic changes occur one and one half to two hours earlier in patients who are managed only with a short-acting insulin such as lispro. 22 Patients with DKA usually present with polyuria, polydipsia, polyphagia, weakness, and Kussmaul's respirations.

INSULIN An intravenous insulin drip is the current standard of care for diabetic ketoacidosis, primarily because of the more rapid onset of action. Studies. Regular insulin should be used intravenously. Lispro and aspart insulin are more expensive and do not work faster than regular insulin when given intravenously. A newly published regimen is treatment of DKA with subcutaneous aspart or lispro insulin. POTASSIUM Whole body potassium deficits typically are 3 to 5 mEq per L. Acidosis increases potassium levels and glucose administered with insulin lowers them. Before treatment of DKA, the level of potassium usually is normal or elevated. Potassium should be started as soon as adequate urine output is confirmed and the potassium level is less than 5 mEq per L. Paresthesias, tremor, carpopedal spasm, agitation, seizures, and cardiac dysrhythmias all are reported symptoms.

Checking magnesium levels and correcting low levels should be considered in patients with DKA. Patients usually are symptomatic at serum levels of 1. 2 mg per dL or lower. 42 If the level is below normal and symptoms are present, administration of magnesium should be considered. 42.

### Association of acute kidney injury during diabetic ketoacidosis with risk of microalbuminuria in type 1 diabetes… [^111L4Jvq]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Objective To determine whether episodes of AKI occurring during DKA in children are associated with increased risk of development of microalbuminuria. Design, Setting, and Participants. Four or more episodes increased the hazard rate by more than 5-fold. DKA episodes without AKI did not significantly increase the hazard rate for microalbuminuria development after adjusting for other covariates. Conclusions and Relevance These data demonstrate that episodes of AKI occurring during DKA in children with type 1 diabetes are significantly associated with risk of developing microalbuminuria. Greater efforts are necessary to reduce the frequency of DKA. Hazard rate estimates were higher for moderate or severe DKA episodes compared with any DKA episodes. Development of AKI during DKA was also associated with an increased hazard rate for microalbuminuria.

Hazard rate estimates for patients with more severe AKI were only minimally higher than those for patients with any episodes of AKI. In a sensitivity analysis that censored patients with possible microalbuminuria, we repeated the univariable and multivariable analyses. These results were similar to the main analyses with AKI episodes during DKA significantly increasing the hazard rate for microalbuminuria. After adjusting for glycemic control and age at diagnosis of T1D in multivariable analyses, a single episode of AKI increased the hazard rate for microalbuminuria by 56%. Multiple episodes increased the hazard rate by as much as 5-fold. Episodes of DKA without occurrence of AKI were not significantly associated with the risk of microalbuminuria.

Because AKI episodes also contribute to risk of albuminuria and CKD in conditions other than diabetes, the current study raises the question of whether AKI during DKA increases risk of DKD or causes kidney injury via a separate mechanism with similar end points. The occurrence of AKI during DKA was associated with a substantially increased hazard rate for development of microalbuminuria. Multiple episodes of AKI increased the hazard rate as much as 5-fold. These data suggest that AKI during DKA contributes to the development of DKD and underscore the importance of DKA prevention in improving health outcomes for children with diabetes.
