65 year old patient complains of left upper leg numbness and stinging that started about 3 days ago. what is the workup

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the workup of a 65-year-old with 3 days of left upper leg numbness and stinging, likely in the L2–L4 territory. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate safety and red flags. Then, I should localize the neuroanatomy and refine the physical examination strategy. Next, I will decide when to image versus when to manage conservatively. After that, I should specify MRI protocols and correlation pitfalls, outline when electrodiagnostics help, consider targeted diagnostic injections, and reserve advanced imaging for unresolved cases. Finally, I need to map treatment escalation and long-term monitoring, while explicitly considering mimics common in upper lumbar distributions [^113sgg8c] [^112BNubN] [^114kY8YK].

> Let me first confirm red flags and immediate risks, because I need to ensure we are not missing cauda equina, infection, cancer, fracture, or other emergent causes; I should ask about cancer history, weight loss, fever, recent or low-velocity trauma, immunosuppression, steroid use, and new bladder or bowel dysfunction, and I should not forget saddle anesthesia or rapidly progressive motor deficit which would necessitate urgent MRI and surgical evaluation. Hold on, I should verify that in older adults even minor trauma and osteoporosis lower the threshold for early imaging and fracture assessment, so I will keep that in mind if any trauma or fragility risk is elicited. Given the neuropathic descriptors of "stinging" and numbness, I will also consider radicular pain phenomenology, typically electric, shocking, or burning with paresthesia or dysesthesia, although distribution can be reminiscent of, but not identical to, classic dermatomes [^113sgg8c] [^114UwfEa] [^112BNubN] [^112P9eXD].

> I will now examine the neuroanatomy and physical exam plan; I need to test L2–L4 myotomes (hip flexion and knee extension), map pinprick and light touch in L2–L4 dermatomes, and assess the patellar reflex, while also observing gait for antalgia or quadriceps insecurity. Wait, I initially thought the straight leg raise would be most informative, but for proximal anterior thigh symptoms suggestive of upper lumbar roots, the femoral nerve stretch is actually more anatomically appropriate, although its diagnostic accuracy is less robust than for lower lumbar tests; SLR and Lasegue's are still useful global dural tension screens but have better utility for L4–S1 patterns than for L2–L4, so I should not overinterpret a negative SLR here. I need to also screen the hip joint to avoid missing osteoarthritis or intra-articular pathology that can mimic L2–L4 radicular symptoms in the anterior thigh and medial knee, because hip pathology is a frequent masquerader in upper lumbar presentations [^113pSq1m] [^115begMi] [^114qNwGW].

> Next, I should review the imaging triage logic; hold on, let's not jump to conclusions that being 65 alone mandates immediate MRI. ACR 2021 supports early imaging in the presence of red flags such as cancer suspicion, infection, immunosuppression, fracture risk including low-velocity trauma with osteoporosis, or progressive neurologic deficits, whereas in the absence of red flags, conservative care for up to 4–6 weeks with reassessment is appropriate to reduce false positives and unnecessary interventions. I need to double-check that in elderly patients, documentation of even minor trauma or fragility osteoporosis tips the scale toward earlier X-ray and/or MRI to exclude occult fracture or compressive lesions [^113sgg8c] [^114UwfEa] [^1151j7Un].

> If there are no red flags and no progressive deficit, let me consider initial conservative management; I should encourage activity rather than bed rest, begin gentle physical therapy with core stabilization and careful stretching, and consider NSAIDs if not contraindicated, with neuropathic pain agents like duloxetine or gabapentin when stinging dysesthesias predominate. I need to ensure expectations are set that many radiculopathies improve within 4–6 weeks, and I should remind myself that MRI abnormalities are common even in asymptomatic people, so early imaging without a plan to act on it can be misleading. Wait, I should confirm that this conservative interval still allows me to pivot early if new red flags or deficits emerge, which would change the timeline immediately [^114kY8YK] [^113pSq1m] [^1151j7Un].

> If not improved by about 4–6 weeks or if the exam is concerning, I should order a lumbar MRI; let me verify protocol specifics: start without IV contrast, add contrast if there is prior surgery, suspected neoplasm, or infection, and ensure sagittal and axial T2 sequences adequately cover upper lumbar levels given the anterior thigh distribution. High-field scanners are preferred, but hold on, I should not dismiss low-field viability; comparative data show good agreement for key degenerative findings, so image quality at lower field strengths may still be clinically actionable. Hmm, wait a minute, I often cite that "73% have concordant compression and 45% have asymptomatic compression" to caution about false positives; I should acknowledge that robust quantitative data come from cervical cohorts yet the principle of imperfect clinicoradiologic concordance applies similarly in the lumbar spine, so I will correlate MRI with focal exam findings and symptom topography rather than treating images in isolation [^111NsmvU] [^115g9pgr] [^113sgg8c].

> If diagnosis remains uncertain or if MRI findings are equivocal or multilevel, I should consider electrodiagnostic testing between weeks 3 and 6; let me first confirm that needle EMG with paraspinals and limb muscles is the core test, complemented by nerve conduction studies to exclude peripheral neuropathies or entrapments that mimic radiculopathy, especially in older adults. Wait, I initially thought to add an H-reflex, but I need to check that this mainly assists with S1 involvement and is less informative for suspected L2–L4, so I should prioritize proximal quadriceps and iliopsoas sampling with paraspinals for an upper lumbar evaluation. I should also remember that EMG has modest sensitivity but high specificity, complements imaging, and positive EMG findings are associated with better responses to epidural steroids and surgery, which can guide prognostication and selection for interventions [^111bipo2] [^111akkLN] [^116QpqRB].

> If the clinical picture suggests a specific culprit root but imaging and EDX are discordant, I should consider a targeted diagnostic injection; a fluoroscopically guided selective nerve root block using small-volume anesthetic can both reproduce and then relieve the familiar pain, improving localization, and can be combined with corticosteroid for short-term therapeutic effect. Hold on, I should verify the reality of adjacent double-root contributions; yes, dual-level reproduction of pain occurs in a sizeable subset, so if the presentation or imaging suggests overlap, staged or combined diagnostic blocks may be necessary. But I need to be cautious: no diagnostic injection is a perfect gold standard, and test performance depends on disease prevalence and clinical context, so I will integrate block responses with exam and imaging, and I won't forget that a diagnostic hip joint injection can clarify hip-driven pain with high accuracy when the exam points to intra-articular pathology [^1115zYRH] [^113Ma1tW] [^114bRH8x] [^111WgvrR].

> If symptoms persist despite nondiagnostic MRI and equivocal EDX, I should review whether advanced imaging could fill the gap; diffusion-weighted MR neurography and DTI can demonstrate nerve root swelling and altered diffusion metrics that correlate with neurophysiology, and 3D MR radiculography can improve visualization of foraminal or extraforaminal pathology that standard planes may miss. Let me verify alternatives if MRI is contraindicated or nondiagnostic; CT myelography remains a reasonable option for operative planning or when metal artifact obscures MRI, and I should not overlook extraspinal causes like retroperitoneal processes such as hydronephrosis compressing the psoas that can mimic radiculopathy when imaging or the clinical course is atypical [^112A9M8M] [^112PddrU] [^111X2Bye] [^115Bvxxi] [^111wzs63].

> Based on a confirmed diagnosis by week 6–12, I need to align treatment with severity and trajectory; if symptoms are mild and improving, I will continue conservative care, but if there is moderate to severe pain with concordant compression and functional limitation, an epidural corticosteroid injection can offer short-term relief over weeks to months, while persistent intractable pain or progressive neurological deficit after an adequate conservative trial warrants surgical referral for decompression such as discectomy. Hold on, I should confirm guardrails: do not offer discectomy for low back pain without radiculopathy, avoid adhesiolysis and avoid fusion for radiculopathy from disc herniation, and use surgery to accelerate recovery primarily when there is ongoing compressive radiculopathy that fails to improve after 4–6 weeks of appropriate nonoperative care [^1157A2Hc] [^112nUiaX] [^116djsME] [^116kcJqv] [^1169Kw5h].

> But wait, what if this isn't an upper lumbar radiculopathy at all; I need to consider mimics that are common in the L2–L4 territory, including hip osteoarthritis and intra-articular pathology, femoral neuropathy, meralgia paresthetica, and myofascial pain, the latter accounting for roughly one fifth of referrals for suspected radiculopathy in some series, and I should remember that true L1–L3 radiculopathies are relatively rare, so pretest probability favors mimics in many proximal anterior thigh presentations. I should double-check for lumbosacral plexopathies and radiculoplexus neuropathies when the pattern is patchy, painful, or involves autonomic or weight loss features, and I should be aware that imaging level and physiological level can occasionally mismatch, especially with upper lumbar stenosis patterns, so clinicophysiologic correlation remains paramount [^113eXhDU] [^114qNwGW] [^1125kYvd] [^111WRb8K] [^115Zd4Eq].

> For long-term monitoring and prevention after resolution, I need to ensure progressive rehabilitation with core strengthening and postural education, address bone health and osteoporosis given the patient's age to reduce future fracture risk, implement fall-prevention strategies, and reserve repeat imaging for new or changing deficits rather than routine surveillance. If interventional procedures were performed, I will remember that expected post-injection MRI changes like localized edema can occur and should not be overinterpreted as complications in the absence of clinical red flags [^113sgg8c] [^113BeGVg].

> In summary, I should proceed in a staged, verification-driven manner: screen for red flags and localize the problem clinically, start conservative care when safe, time MRI thoughtfully and interpret it with clinical correlation, deploy EDX to clarify competing diagnoses, use selective blocks judiciously when localization remains uncertain, consider advanced imaging or extraspinal sources if the usual workup is negative, and escalate to epidural steroids or surgery only when the diagnosis and the failure of conservative care are clear. Let me reiterate to myself not to anchor prematurely on imaging in an older adult and to maintain vigilance for hip and peripheral nerve mimics, because getting the diagnosis right is what determines whether interventions help or harm [^113sgg8c] [^1151j7Un] [^111bipo2] [^114kY8YK].

For a 65-year-old with new left upper leg numbness and stinging, the workup should begin with a **focused history and exam** to localize the deficit and screen for **red flags** [^112BNubN]. If **red flags** are present, obtain an **urgent MRI** of the lumbar spine and pelvis [^114UwfEa]; otherwise, obtain MRI if symptoms persist or progress after 4–6 weeks of conservative care [^1151j7Un]. Electrodiagnostic testing (**EMG/NCS**) is indicated when the diagnosis is unclear or to distinguish radiculopathy from peripheral neuropathy or plexopathy [^111bipo2] [^111akkLN]. Consider vascular studies when pulses are diminished or when vascular claudication is suspected. Early imaging is warranted if the patient is elderly, has osteoporosis, or is on chronic steroids [^113sgg8c].

---

## Clinical history and physical examination

### Clinical history

Elicit onset and duration; an **acute 3-day onset** suggests radiculopathy, plexopathy, or peripheral neuropathy. Characterize pain with neuropathic descriptors — burning, stinging, or electric quality — which suggest nerve involvement [^112P9eXD]. Review associated symptoms, including weakness, gait instability, bowel or bladder dysfunction, and systemic features such as fever or weight loss. Obtain a medical history of diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, smoking, malignancy, recent trauma, infections, and autoimmune disorders, and review medications, including anticoagulants, immunosuppressants, and chronic corticosteroid use. Screen for **red flags** such as rapid progression, severe weakness, saddle anesthesia, bowel or bladder dysfunction, fever, weight loss, and history of malignancy [^112BNubN].

---

### Physical examination

Perform a **focused neurological examination**, including sensory testing (light touch, pinprick, vibration, proprioception), myotomal motor strength, reflexes (patellar, Achilles), coordination, and gait assessment. Include special tests — straight leg raise, femoral nerve stretch test, and Tinel's sign at the inguinal ligament for meralgia paresthetica — and perform a vascular examination assessing pulses, bruits, and capillary refill [^113pSq1m] [^1122AtEq]. Identify **red flags**, including motor weakness, hyperreflexia, Babinski sign, saddle anesthesia, and bowel or bladder dysfunction.

---

## Differential diagnosis

The differential diagnosis for acute left upper leg numbness and stinging includes:

| **Category** | **Conditions** |
|-|-|
| Radiculopathy | - Lumbar disc herniation (L2-L4) [^117X8FP5] <br/> - Lumbar spinal stenosis [^114GkY1G] <br/> - Foraminal stenosis <br/> - Degenerative disc disease |
| Peripheral neuropathy | - Femoral neuropathy <br/> - Lateral femoral cutaneous neuropathy (meralgia paresthetica) <br/> - Diabetic neuropathy [^116QpqRB] <br/> - Entrapment neuropathies [^111akkLN] |
| Plexopathy | - Lumbosacral plexopathy (diabetic amyotrophy, neoplastic infiltration, radiation-induced) [^111WRb8K] [^111xa8up] |
| Vascular | - Peripheral arterial disease [^1122AtEq] <br/> - Femoral artery aneurysm <br/> - Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) |
| Musculoskeletal | - Hip osteoarthritis <br/> - Greater trochanteric pain syndrome [^114qNwGW] <br/> - Myofascial pain syndrome [^113eXhDU] |
| Systemic | - Multiple sclerosis <br/> - Guillain-Barré syndrome <br/> - Amyloidosis [^111wUq3K] |

## Diagnostic workup

### Initial laboratory tests

- **CBC**: Evaluate for infection, anemia, malignancy.
- **ESR/CRP**: Inflammatory markers for infection, inflammatory arthritis, malignancy [^112BNubN].
- **CMP**: Electrolyte abnormalities, renal/hepatic dysfunction.
- **HbA1c**: Screen for diabetes mellitus.
- **TSH**: Evaluate thyroid dysfunction.
- **Vitamin B12**: Screen for deficiency-related neuropathy.

---

### Imaging studies

- **MRI lumbar spine**: Preferred initial imaging for suspected radiculopathy, spinal stenosis, or disc herniation [^1151j7Un].
- **MRI pelvis**: Evaluate for plexopathy, femoral neuropathy, or pelvic masses [^111xa8up].
- **MRI hip**: Assess for hip joint pathology, greater trochanteric pain syndrome [^114qNwGW].
- **CT myelography**: Alternative if MRI contraindicated [^115Bvxxi].
- **Ultrasound**: Evaluate for DVT, femoral artery aneurysm.

---

### Electrodiagnostic studies

Electrodiagnostic studies comprise **EMG/NCS**, which help differentiate radiculopathy from peripheral neuropathy or plexopathy and assess severity and chronicity [^111akkLN] [^111bipo2].

---

### Additional tests (if indicated)

Order **lumbar puncture** when CNS infection or inflammatory demyelinating disease (e.g. Guillain-Barré syndrome) is suspected [^115ziHjH]. Use a selective nerve root block as a diagnostic and therapeutic tool for radiculopathy [^1115zYRH]. Obtain vascular studies, such as ankle-brachial index and Doppler ultrasound, when vascular claudication is suspected.

---

## Indications for urgent or emergent evaluation

Immediate evaluation and intervention are required if:

- **Rapidly progressive neurological deficits**: Motor weakness, hyperreflexia, Babinski sign.
- **Cauda equina syndrome**: Saddle anesthesia, bowel/bladder dysfunction.
- **Suspected vascular compromise**: Acute limb ischemia, DVT.
- **Suspected infection or malignancy**: Fever, weight loss, history of malignancy [^112BNubN].

---

## Management plan

Begin with **conservative management**, including physical therapy, analgesics, neuropathic pain agents such as gabapentin or pregabalin, and corticosteroids for inflammation. Consider interventional procedures — epidural steroid injections and selective nerve root blocks — if symptoms persist or if localization supports a focal source [^1157A2Hc]. Reserve surgical intervention for severe or progressive neurological deficits, refractory radiculopathy, or structural lesions causing nerve compression [^112nUiaX].

---

A 65-year-old patient with acute left upper-leg numbness and stinging requires a **focused history, physical exam, and targeted diagnostics** to localize the lesion and identify the cause. MRI is the preferred initial imaging modality for suspected radiculopathy or spinal stenosis [^1151j7Un], while EMG/NCS help differentiate radiculopathy from peripheral neuropathy or plexopathy [^111bipo2]. Urgent evaluation is necessary for **rapidly progressive deficits, cauda equina syndrome, vascular compromise** [^1122AtEq], or **suspected infection or malignancy** [^114UwfEa].

### Evaluation of persons with suspected lumbosacral and cervical radiculopathy: Electrodiagnostic assessment and implications for treatment and outcomes (Part II) [^111akkLN]. Muscle & Nerve (2020). Low credibility.

The electrodiagnostic (EDX) examination with needle electromyography (EMG) is the most important means of testing for radiculopathy. This test has modest sensitivity but high specificity and complements imaging of the spine. In this second part of a two-part review, the implications of electrodiagnostic findings for diagnosis and clinical management of persons with radiculopathy are reviewed. An EMG-confirmed lumbosacral radiculopathy is associated with better clinical outcomes for persons undergoing aggressive conservative management. A positive EMG test portends a better clinical response to epidural corticosteroid injections. If a person undergoes spine surgery, a positive pre-operative EMG for radiculopathy is also associated with better outcomes.

- **Preoperative and intraoperative imaging analysis**: The preoperative lumbar spine X-ray showed a wedge-shaped deformity of the L4 vertebral body with bone cement injection indicated by a white arrow. Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a protruded L4-L5 disc herniation with upward migration, marked by a white arrowhead. The MRI axial view showed severe foraminal stenosis at the left L4-L5 level, noted with an asterisk.

- **Intraoperative findings and procedure**: After resecting the superior articular process, the partial inferior articular process, and removing bone fragments, the compressed exiting nerve root of L4 and the upward herniated disc were exposed. The nerve root was decompressed by removing the disc fragment with forceps or a hook. The decompressed nerve root was indicated by white dash lines, and the resected herniated disc was pointed out by a white arrow.

- **Statistical analysis**: Quantitative variables were calculated as means ± standard deviations, and qualitative variables as numbers. Two-sample t-tests were performed for continuous variables. A P-value of < 0.05 represented a statistically significant difference.

### Musculoskeletal mimics of lumbosacral radiculopathy [^113eXhDU]. Muscle & Nerve (2025).

Myofascial pain syndrome is defined as pain originating from an exquisitely tender, taut muscular band within skeletal muscle that reproduces the patient's pain experience. Although there is incomplete consensus, it is often observed in regional pain syndromes and features radiation of pain that can mimic radiculopathy. In one study of patients referred for suspected lumbosacral radiculopathy, 20% were found to have myofascial pain.

The hallmark of myofascial pain is subjective pain resulting from firm manual pressure over bands of muscle fibers by the clinician. Myofascial referral patterns often encompass several dermatomal territories of the lower extremities. As a result, myofascial pain often leads to paresthesiae and dysesthesiae in anatomical regions that are remote from the site of trigger points, thus mimicking radiculopathy arising from multiple root levels.

There is a high prevalence of myofascial pain among patients referred for electrodiagnostic studies, and it is much more common in individuals with normal studies than those with electrodiagnostically proven dysfunction of the peripheral nervous system. There are no specific "special tests" that can be used to diagnose myofascial pain. While diagnostic imaging such as ultrasound has been described for evaluating myofascial pain syndrome and accompanying myofascial trigger points, it has yet to be widely adopted into clinical practice, in part due to limited evidence.

### Recommendations for terminology and the identification of neuropathic pain in people with spine-related leg pain. Outcomes from the NeuPSIG working group [^112P9eXD]. Pain (2023). Low credibility.

Radicular pain is likely associated with hyperexcitability and ectopic discharges of dorsal roots or dorsal root ganglia. This hyperexcitability and ectopic discharges may result from inflammatory irritation, ischaemia, mechanical deformation of neural structures, or a combination of these factors and their downstream mechanisms, such as inflammation.

The pain may be described as shocking, lancinating, electric, stabbing, or shooting and is often accompanied by a dull background ache. We have further added sharp and burning as potential pain descriptors, as these are frequently reported by patients with lumbar radicular pain. With radicular pain, the pain may be spontaneous or evoked, for instance, by certain movements of the spine or leg. In addition to pain, patients may experience paraesthesia and dysaesthesia, such as tingling, a "woolen feeling", or "a block of ice".

The pain can be felt deep or cutaneous and may radiate into the leg in areas reminiscent of, but not necessarily identical to, dermatomes. The working group further agreed to remove the original description of "band-like" location of the pain, which seemed sufficiently covered by "areas reminiscent of, but not necessarily identical to, dermatomes".

### Radiculopathy in the setting of lumbar nerve root compression due to an extradural intraforaminal lipoma: A report of 3 cases [^112WU5aU]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2015). Low credibility.

A true adult spinal lipoma is an exceedingly rare cause of lumbar compression neuropathy. Only five cases of true extradural intraforaminal lipomas have been documented in the medical literature. The diagnostic criteria and treatment guidelines for this specific lipoma have yet to be established. This report features three histologically confirmed cases of extradural intraforaminal spinal lipomas that recently presented to the authors' practice. In addition, the literature was surveyed to include the five previously reported cases of true adult extradural intraforaminal spinal lipomas. The consistency in presentation, response to surgical intervention, and postoperative recovery in these eight cases supports surgical intervention at the time of diagnosis.

The authors' findings support elevated clinical suspicion, efficient diagnosis based on MRI, and early surgical intervention for this rare pathological entity. All cases presented in this report were symptomatic and occurred in the absence of other significant pathologies such as general spinal epidural lipomatosis, intradural lesions, tethering, or severe degenerative stenosis or herniated discs. The clinical, neuroradiological, and histological findings characteristic of a true adult extradural intraforaminal lipoma are emphasized to differentiate this lesion from the more common etiologies for lumbar compression neuropathy. Heightened awareness and clinical suspicion for the focal, foraminal spinal lipoma as a cause of radiculopathy symptoms will enable more efficient diagnosis and treatment.

### Accuracy of clinical tests in detecting disk herniation and nerve root compression in subjects with lumbar radicular symptoms [^115begMi]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2018). Low credibility.

The objective of this study is to investigate the accuracy of three commonly used neurodynamic tests: the slump test, the straight-leg raise (SLR) test, and the femoral neurodynamic test. Additionally, two clinical assessments, radiculopathy I (one neurologic sign) and radiculopathy II (two neurologic signs corresponding to one specific nerve root), were employed to detect magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings, namely extrusion, subarticular nerve root compression, and foraminal nerve root compression.

- **Design**: This is a validity study conducted in a secondary care setting.

- **Participants**: The study included 99 subjects, with a mean age of 58 years and 54% women, who were referred for epidural steroid injection due to lumbar radicular symptoms. All participants had positive clinical and MRI findings. Positive clinical findings included the slump test (n = 67), SLR test (n = 50), femoral neurodynamic test (n = 7), radiculopathy I (n = 70), and radiculopathy II (n = 33). Positive MRI findings were extrusion (n = 27), subarticular nerve compression (n = 14), and foraminal nerve compression (n = 25).

- **Interventions**: Not applicable.

- **Main outcome measures**: The accuracy of clinical tests in detecting MRI findings was evaluated using sensitivity, specificity, and receiver operating characteristics analysis with an area under the curve (AUC).

- **Results**: The slump test had the highest sensitivity in detecting extrusion (.78) and subarticular nerve compression (1.00), although the specificity for these was low (.36 and .38, respectively). Radiculopathy I was most sensitive in detecting foraminal nerve compression (.80) but also had low specificity (.34). Only one assessment demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity, highlighting the challenge in achieving both in clinical evaluations.

### Motor amplitudes may predict electromyography-confirmed radiculopathy in patients referred for radiating limb pain [^113ioPMJ]. Muscle & Nerve (2019). Low credibility.

Radiculopathy is diagnosed by needle electromyography, with nerve conduction studies excluding alternative diagnoses.

- **Methods**: In patients referred for electrodiagnostic evaluation of radiating limb pain, we compared ulnar motor amplitudes between those with and without electromyographically confirmed C8 radiculopathy, as well as fibular motor amplitudes between those with and without electromyographically confirmed L5 radiculopathy.

- **Results**: Patients with electromyographically confirmed C8 or L5 radiculopathy demonstrated decreased ulnar or fibular motor amplitudes, respectively, as compared to patients without radiculopathy. Receiver operating characteristic curves demonstrated good diagnostic accuracy, with areas under the curve of 0.85 and 0.82, respectively. Optimal cut-offs for electromyographically confirmed C8 and L5 radiculopathies were 10.2 mV and 3.6 mV, respectively, with associated sensitivities/specificities of 0.86/0.74 and 0.92/0.60.

- **Discussion**: Ulnar and fibular motor amplitudes may have clinical utility in assessing the likelihood of patients demonstrating electromyographically confirmed C8 and L5 radiculopathies with active denervation. The findings may be particularly useful in patients intolerant of needle electromyography. Muscle Nerve 59:561–561, 2019.

### Causes of lumbosacral plexopathy [^111xa8up]. Clinical Radiology (2006). Low credibility.

The lumbosacral plexus represents the nerve supply to the lower back, pelvis, and legs. This review focuses on diseases and disorders affecting the pathway, as demonstrated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT). It stresses the importance of reviewing the lumbosacral plexus in patients with non-specific symptoms, such as back, hip, and pelvic pain, and in those presenting with sciatica not accompanied by demonstrable intervertebral disc prolapse. The imaging appearances may be non-specific, reinforcing the significance of clinical history and the use of tissue sampling to achieve an accurate diagnosis.

### The electrodiagnostic sensitivity of proximal lower extremity muscles in the diagnosis of L5 radiculopathy [^113dkJ3V]. Muscle & Nerve (2012). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to assess the electrodiagnostic (EDx) sensitivity of proximal lower extremity muscles, including the tensor fascia lata (TFL) and gluteus medius (GMED), in diagnosing L5 radiculopathy. Eleven EDx recordings with L5 radiculopathy were collected; the motor unit action potentials were assessed for morphology, stability, and firing characteristics. A descriptive analysis was performed.

- **Findings in muscles**: In proximal L5-supplied muscles, 4 of 11 recordings were abnormal in TFL only, with normal GMED; 4 of 11 recordings had similar findings in both muscles; 2 of 11 had abnormal findings in both muscles, but TFL had more noticeable findings; and 1 had abnormal findings in both muscles, but GMED findings were more noticeable. No patient had abnormalities limited to GMED.

- **Conclusion**: TFL was more sensitive than GMED in detecting L5 radiculopathy. Knowing which muscles are more likely to show abnormalities can improve the efficiency of EMG and reduce patient discomfort.

### Incidence of and risk factors for lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy in adults: a systematic review [^115Q14bg]. European Spine Journal (2025). Low credibility.

Our review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 statement. Details of our protocol were registered in the international prospective register of systematic reviews (PROSPERO No. CRD42011001197). This review was initially conducted in partial fulfilment of a doctoral dissertation in epidemiology as an unpublished manuscript, which we updated to September 2023.

- **Data sources and search strategy**: We systematically searched Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Trials Registry, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Database of Abstracts Related to Effects; initially from 1970 to March 2016. In February 2022, we conducted an update and identified records published between April 2016 and January 2022. We ran a final search update to 21 September 2023. Search strategies combined terms from three key concepts: intervertebral disc herniation, lumbar spine, and etiology, and were developed in consultation with an experienced information specialist (Appendix 1 in Online Supplementary Material). The reference lists of all eligible studies were also searched for additional relevant studies.

- **Eligibility criteria**: Eligible were studies published in English, French, or Spanish that used cohort, case–control, or randomized trial (only potentially eligible for risk factor evidence) designs to examine the incidence of and/or risk factors for LDH with radiculopathy in adults (aged 18 years or older). We excluded studies of asymptomatic LDH, or LDH due to neoplasm, infection, fracture, dislocation, or s

### Relationships between the integrity and function of lumbar nerve roots as assessed by diffusion tensor imaging and neurophysiology [^112PddrU]. Neuroradiology (2017). Low credibility.

Evidence has shown that L5 and S1 nerve roots respond to neurophysiological testing differently. Previous work on the sensitivity of neurophysiological testing for each level of lumbar nerve root lesion found that the percentage of positive pathological results on EMG and in F-wave latencies was higher in L5 nerve root lesions than in S1 nerve root lesions. This may also explain the correlation between neurophysiology and DTI, which was not evident for the S1 nerve root but was found for the L5 nerve root. Alternatively, the discrepancy in correlations could be explained by the lack of variability in our healthy subject data; the DTI data were consistent, and the neurophysiological data were within normal ranges. It is therefore possible that associations might be revealed under pathological conditions, where changes in both neurophysiological and structural parameters are likely. A further study of the relationships between DTI metrics and neurophysiological measures in patients with compressed lumbar nerve roots is currently in progress.

In conclusion, the findings provide a preliminary set of normative values of diffusion metrics for L5 and S1 nerve roots. This suggests the potential for this DTI technique to be used in assessing lumbar spinal nerves in clinical settings, as the values from the healthy subjects were highly consistent across the nerves of both sides as well as across levels. The relationships between DTI parameters and neurophysiological measures demonstrate the utility of using DTI metrics as a measure of nerve integrity and function.

### Musculoskeletal mimics of lumbosacral radiculopathy [^114qNwGW]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Low credibility.

Musculoskeletal mimics of L1 radiculopathies tend to cause pain in the inguinal region. Epidemiologically, L1 radiculopathies are rare, and clinicians should strongly consider the possibility of an alternative diagnosis. Similarly, L2 radiculopathies are rare; for patients with pain in the groin and proximal thigh referred for suspected L2 radiculopathy, the examining clinician should strongly consider other diagnoses. Radiculopathy affecting the L3 nerve root, which typically causes pain in the medial knee, is uncommon, whereas musculoskeletal conditions that reproduce pain in this region are common. Radiculopathies affecting the L4 nerve root, which cause pain in the medial leg, are also uncommon compared to L5 and S1 radiculopathies, but more common than L1–L3 radiculopathies. Although L5 and S1 radiculopathies, which typically cause pain in the anterolateral leg and posterior thigh respectively, comprise the bulk of lumbosacral radiculopathies, conditions that mimic radicular pain in these distributions are also common. Common musculoskeletal mimics of radiculopathy are summarized in Table 2.

- **Anatomical landmarks for palpation tenderness**: Landmarks for palpation tenderness relevant to the assessment of these conditions are illustrated in Figure 2. Palpation of the selected anatomical landmarks can be useful for identifying potential generators of patients' pain. The presence of pain on palpation at these landmarks as part of a comprehensive history and physical examination may suggest the particular musculoskeletal mimic in question.

### Electrodiagnostic characteristics of upper lumbar stenosis: Discrepancy between neurological and structural levels [^115Zd4Eq]. Muscle & Nerve (2020). Low credibility.

Radiculopathies caused by spinal stenosis in the upper lumbar spinal canal (L1/2, L2/3, L3/4) have not been comprehensively investigated.

- **Methods**: This retrospective study reviewed 14 patients from a tertiary hospital outpatient clinic. The inclusion criteria were upper lumbar stenosis seen on MRI and radiculopathies with active denervation confirmed on electromyography. Patients with any other conditions that could explain the clinical or electrophysiological manifestations were excluded.

- **Results**: Neurogenic findings were predominantly observed in L5 or S1 myotomes on electromyography. Abnormal spontaneous activity was observed in distal muscles in all patients and in proximal muscles in eight patients. Axonal involvement was bilateral in 10 patients and unilateral in 4 patients. MRI showed redundant nerve roots in 13 patients with chronic reinnervation on electromyography.

- **Conclusions**: Upper lumbar spinal stenosis usually causes L5 or S1 radiculopathies with diverse patterns. This discrepancy may cause diagnostic confusion.

### Relationships between the integrity and function of lumbar nerve roots as assessed by diffusion tensor imaging and neurophysiology [^112A9M8M]. Neuroradiology (2017). Low credibility.

Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has the potential to complement standard MRI, as it provides a quantitative measure of tissue microstructure and nerve integrity. However, DTI of the lumbar spine is challenging due to the relatively small cross-sectional area of the lumbar nerve roots, susceptibility artifacts around the spinal cord from tissue-bone interfaces, and the co-localization of large stores of body fat. Despite these challenges, initial work with DTI and tractography to visualize and evaluate these nerves in healthy subjects and patients with lumbar nerve compression has shown promising results. Lower fractional anisotropy (FA) and higher mean diffusivity (MD) or apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) have been observed in compressed nerve roots compared to both contralateral uncompressed nerve roots and equivalent nerve roots in healthy subjects.

The function of nerve roots can be assessed using neurophysiology. Combined with DTI, this provides an opportunity to test the degree to which alteration in nerve integrity relates to function. Work in the central nervous system shows correlations between diffusion metrics and neurophysiological measures. For example, corpus callosum DTI parameters correlate with interhemispheric inhibition measured by paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), suggesting that structural abnormalities demonstrated by DTI have a functional impact. The function of lumbar spinal nerves is routinely assessed using neurophysiological testing (e.g. nerve conduction studies) and is altered in patients with radiculopathy. However, whethe…

### General principles of diagnostic testing as related to painful lumbar spine disorders: A critical appraisal of current diagnostic techniques [^114bRH8x]. Spine (2002). Low credibility.

Study design: The literature on diagnostic tests available to the spine clinician for the evaluation of chronic low back pain was reviewed.

- **Objectives**: To review critically the available information and data on invasive diagnostic tests used for evaluation of chronic low back pain.

- **Summary of background information**: Numerous published studies have described the technique and clinical results of diagnostic blocks for chronic low back pain. There are various methodologies, but most lack an adequate "gold standard" with which to compare the results of the diagnostic test.

- **Methods**: The available published studies of diagnostic tests commonly used in the evaluation of chronic low back pain were reviewed, with a focus on invasive techniques. The techniques were evaluated based on the data available to support the conclusions that could be drawn for each of these techniques. The principles of diagnostic testing, including specificity and sensitivity, were reviewed and applied in the context of the data available for each of these invasive tests.

- **Results**: The essential features the clinician seeks in a diagnostic test are accuracy, safety, and reproducibility. It is essential to have a gold standard with which to compare the accuracy of a given diagnostic test. There is no completely reliable gold standard with which to compare a diagnostic test (or injection) when the absence of pain is the endpoint. The clinical setting in which the test is used directly affects the test results. The prevalence of the disease therefore affects the meaningfulness of the test results.

### Diagnostic capability of low- versus high-field magnetic resonance imaging for lumbar degenerative disease [^111NsmvU]. Spine (2015). Low credibility.

This cohort study investigates the diagnostic capability of low-field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) compared with high-field MRI for degenerative disease of the lumbar spine. Low-field MRI offers several advantages over high-field systems, such as easier installation, and lower purchase and maintenance costs. However, its diagnostic capability for lumbar spine degenerative disease has not been directly compared to that of high-field MRI.

The study involved 100 patients (mean age: 56.3 years, range: 32–80; female:male ratio = 59:41) with neurogenic claudication or sciatica. All patients underwent MRI of the lumbar spine using both low-field (0.25T) and high-field (1.5T or 3.0T) systems. Two radiologists evaluated intervertebral disc herniation, central canal, lateral recess, and exit foraminal stenosis, as well as nerve root compression at L3-L4, L4-L5, and L5-S1, using established reliable grading systems.

The results showed excellent agreement between low- and high-field MRI in grading the presence and severity of disc herniation (r = 0.92–0.94; P < 0.05), central canal stenosis (r = 0.89–0.91; P < 0.05), lateral recess stenosis (r = 0.81–0.87; P < 0.05), and exit foraminal stenosis (r = 0.81–0.89; P < 0.05). Nerve root compression was observed in 52% of patients at the L3-L4, L4-L5, or L5-S1 levels, with good agreement between low-field and high-field MRI (r = 0.71–0.76; P < 0.05) for nerve root compression.

### Magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbar spine after epidural and nerve root injection therapy: Evaluation of soft tissue changes [^113BeGVg]. Clinical Imaging (2006). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed to evaluate soft tissue changes after nerve root and epidural injections in the lumbar spine of patients with radiculopathy.

- **Materials/methods**: Patients underwent a multiple-shot injection protocol to the nerve root/epidural space. The MRI protocol included T1-weighted, T2-weighted, STIR, and contrast-enhanced, fat-saturated T1-weighted sequences both before and after treatment.

- **Results**: In all treated patients, a diffuse wedge-shaped edema in paravertebral tissues with slight contrast enhancement was seen. Two small hematomas in the paravertebral muscle were noted. No changes in the epidural space, such as abscess or lipodystrophy, in the epidural/nerve root space occurred.

- **Conclusion**: Normal tissue changes after injection therapy for lumbar radiculopathy include wedge-shaped tissue edema at the injection level. In a minority of patients, small hematomas may occur.

### Comparison of surgical and electrodiagnostic findings in single root lumbosacral radiculopathies [^114sGY4m]. Muscle & Nerve (2003). Low credibility.

To identify the segmental innervation of L-2-S-1 muscles, we compared the preoperative electrodiagnostic examinations of 45 patients with single-level lumbosacral radiculopathies confirmed radiologically and surgically. The electrodiagnostic findings were classified as abnormal only by the needle examination and only if muscles demonstrated active denervation or a marked neurogenic motor unit potential firing pattern.

In comparison to other surgical, intraoperative root stimulation, and clinical studies, we found several differences. Overall, there was little overlap among L-2–4, L-5, and S-1 radiculopathies. The tibialis anterior was predominantly L-5 innervated, the gastrocnemius (medial and lateral head) predominantly S-1 innervated, and the biceps femoris (short and long head) exclusively S-1 innervated. The two heads of biceps femoris were not affected in any patients with L-5 radiculopathy in whom they were examined. These findings help guide both the clinician and surgeon in the diagnosis and treatment of lumbosacral radiculopathies.

### Compression of root level in a patient with hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging [^113igpiy]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2016). Low credibility.

Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is characterized by acute, painless, and recurrent mononeuropathies that are secondary to compression or minor trauma. This case is the first to report an intraspinal compression of the radicular nerve by schwannoma in a patient with HNPP. A 66-year-old woman developed left foot drop and paresthesia of the lateral aspects of the left distal lower leg. An electromyography showed left L5 radiculopathy and severe peripheral polyneuropathy. A lumbosacral magnetic resonance imaging revealed a radicular nerve in the intradural and extramedullary space being compressed by schwannoma. She previously had symptoms of foot drop several years ago, and HNPP was confirmed by peripheral myelin protein 22 deletion. She was surgically treated for L5 radiculopathy, which might have been caused by a traction of the nerve root by schwannoma at the intradural and extramedullary space. After surgical treatment, her symptoms of foot drop improved from zero grade to IV+ grade within 4 weeks. The occurrence of HNPP and schwannoma in the same patient may be coincidental, but it is tempting to speculate that they share a common genetic basis. Therefore, for patients with HNPP, it is important to consider not only an electrophysiologic study but also a magnetic resonance imaging to locate the exact pathologic site.

### A sensitive electrodiagnostic method for detecting sensory conduction deficits in an experimental single lumbar radicular lesion [^113SgnPb]. Spine (2002). Low credibility.

For a single L5 radicular lesion produced by constant, localized compression, sequential changes of epidurally recorded potentials after sciatic nerve stimulation or direct L5 root stimulation were compared with those after indirect L5 root stimulation with a collision technique in rats.

- **Objective**: To determine whether the use of the collision technique improves the diagnostic yield of the lumbosacral-evoked potential study for a single radicular lesion.

- **Summary of background data**: Clinical recording of the evoked potentials at serial intervertebral spaces after stimulation of the peroneal or the tibial nerve was less sensitive than what might be expected for a single radicular lesion, presumably because peripheral nerve stimulation activates more than a nerve root, thereby normal responses arising from the unaffected roots tending to mask mild conduction abnormalities of the diseased root. Furthermore, direct stimulation of the nerve root with a monopolar electrode, despite potential advantages, produces an overloading stimulus artifact. This precludes accurate recording because of the short distance between the stimulus and recording sites. A collision technique should circumvent these problems.

- **Methods**: A vascular clip was applied to the L5 root and evoked potentials were recorded epidurally at T10–11 after sciatic nerve stimulation (Group 1, 11 rats), L5 root stimulation (Group 2, 14 rats), or a combination of L6 root and sciatic nerve stimulation (Group 3, 11 rats), at 3-minute intervals during a 15-minute period of compression and additionally for 15 minutes.

### Three-dimensional magnetic resonance rendering imaging of lumbosacral radiculography in the diagnosis of symptomatic extraforaminal disc herniation with or without foraminal extension [^111X2Bye]. Spine (2012). Low credibility.

The study design involved a retrospective analysis of lumbosacral radiculography using three-dimensional (3D) magnetic resonance (MR) rendering in patients with extraforaminal disc herniation.

The objective was to investigate the significance of lumbosacral radiculography as depicted by 3D MR rendering in diagnosing symptomatic extraforaminal disc herniation with or without foraminal extension.

- **Summary of background data**: Accurate evaluation of extraforaminal zones on routine axial and sagittal images is challenging, often leading to overlooked extraforaminal disc herniations. Oblique coronal images along intervertebral foramina and MR myelography may not clearly demonstrate a detailed view of nerve root changes. Detecting morphologic changes in the nerve root is crucial for diagnosing symptomatic extraforaminal disc herniation. Therefore, a reliable method to evaluate the nerve root for diagnosis is necessary.

- **Methods**: Twenty-four patients with extraforaminal and combined (extraforaminal with foraminal) lumbar disc herniations were included in this study. Conventional spin-echo sequences and 3D coronal fast-field echo sequences with selective water excitation using the principles of the selective excitation technique (Proset imaging) were employed. The study evaluated indentation and swelling of nerve roots and dorsal root ganglion (DRG) on symptomatic sides and levels based on 3D MR rendering images of the lumbar spine.

### Value of 3D MR lumbosacral radiculography in the diagnosis of symptomatic chemical radiculitis [^117BWMeH]. AJNR. American Journal of Neuroradiology (2012). Low credibility.

Radiologic methods for the diagnosis of chemical radiculitis associated with anular tears in the lumbar spine have been rare. Provocative diskography is one of the methods for diagnosing diskogenic chemical radiculitis but is invasive. A reliable imaging method for replacing provocative diskography and diagnosing chemical radiculitis is required. Our aim was to investigate the value of 3D MR radiculography depicted by rendering imaging in the diagnosis of symptomatic chemical radiculopathy associated with anular tears.

- **Materials and methods**: The study population consisted of 17 patients (age range, 32–88 years) with unilateral radiculopathy. Symptomatic chemical radiculopathy was confirmed with provocative CT diskography and/or provocative selective nerve root block for agreement of sides and levels. Through adhering to the principles of selective excitation (Proset imaging), we acquired 3D coronal FFE sequences with selective water excitation. Morphologic changes in the ipsilateral symptomatic nerve root caused by chemical radiculopathy were compared with those in the contralateral nerve root on 3D MR lumbosacral radiculography.

- **Results**: Pain reproduction at the contrast-leak level during diskography (n = 4) and selective nerve root injection (n = 13) showed concordant pain in all patients. All patients with symptomatic chemical radiculopathy showed nerve root swelling in both ipsilateral levels and sides on 3D MR radiculography. The most common nerve root affected by the chemical radiculopathy was the L5 nerve root (n = 13).

### L5 radiculopathy due to foraminal stenosis accompanied with vacuum phenomena of the L5/S disc on radiography images in extension position [^117Ryaeh]. Spine (2015). Low credibility.

The study employs a retrospective design to investigate L5 radiculopathy caused by foraminal stenosis accompanied by vacuum phenomena (VP) at the L5/S disc. The objective is to examine the influence of the L5/S VP on L5 radiculopathy resulting from L5/S foraminal stenosis.

Foraminal stenosis is a condition often detected via imaging. However, despite its recognition, it is occasionally overlooked during diagnosis because spinal nerve compression is not always visible on stationary images.

Patients who underwent lumbar spine surgery were evaluated to determine the presence of foraminal stenosis (n = 194). The presence of VP and the range of motion of the L5/S disc were assessed on radiography images with the lumbar spine in the extended and flexed positions. The shapes of the L5/S foramina were confirmed using sagittal magnetic resonance imaging. Patients showing VP were divided into two groups: those with (group A) and without (group B) symptomatic foraminal stenosis. The relationship between VP and symptomatic foraminal stenosis was examined.

A total of 35 cases of VP at the L5/S disc were noted on lateral radiography. In 14 of these 35 cases, L5 radiculopathy due to L5/S foraminal stenosis was identified. The ranges of L5/S angles were 10° ± 4° in group A and 5° ± 3° in group B, with these values showing significant difference (P < 0.01). Out of the 23 L5/S foramina exhibiting VP and completely occupied by a disc below the caudal edge of the vertebra, 11 (48%) demonstrated symptomatic foraminal stenosis.

In conclusion, our results indicate that VP, which…

### Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging of symptomatic nerve root of patients with lumbar disk herniation [^114icEGu]. Neuroradiology (2011). Low credibility.

Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) can provide valuable structural information that may be useful for evaluating pathological changes of the lumbar nerve root. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) neurography has recently been introduced as an alternative way to visualize nerves, but at the time of writing, quantitative DWI and MR neurography have not been applied to evaluate the pathology of lumbar nerve roots.

- **Methods**: Our purpose was to visualize lumbar nerve roots and to analyze their morphology by MR neurography, and to measure the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of lumbar nerve roots compressed by herniated disks using 1.5-T MR imaging. Ten consecutive patients (median age, 48.0 and range, 20–72 years) with monoradicular symptoms caused by a lumbar herniated disk and 14 healthy volunteers were studied. Regions of interest were placed on the lumbar roots at dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and distal spinal nerves on DWI to quantify mean ADC values. The spinal nerve roots were also visualized by MR neurography.

- **Results**: In the patients, mean ADC values were significantly greater in the compressed DRG and distal spinal nerves than in intact nerves. MR neurography also showed abnormalities such as nerve swelling at and below the compression in the symptomatic nerve root. Increased ADC values were considered to be due to edema and Wallerian degeneration of compressed nerve roots.

- **Conclusion**: DWI is a potential tool for analysis of the pathophysiology of lumbar nerve roots compressed by herniated disks.

### A pilot study of radiculopathy following osteoporotic vertebral fracture in elderly patients: An algorithmic approach to surgical management [^112tPf6A]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2021). Low credibility.

- **Preoperative imaging findings**:
	- (A) Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sagittal view shows fracture in the lower L4 vertebral body.
	- (B) Preoperative computed tomography (CT) shows the bone fragment compressed intervertebral foramen space.
	- (C) Preoperative MRI shows the fragment covered in a fibrous film of the posterior wall of the fractured vertebral body compressing the L4 root from the front at the foramen (red ring).
	- (D) Preoperative MRI axial view shows severe foraminal stenosis at the L4-L5 right side (yellow ring).
	- (E and F) Introduced endoscopy and performed foraminoplasty using the drill.
	- (G) Well decompressed nerve root.
	- (H) Resected the superior articular process and removed bone fragment (blue ring).

- **Postoperative imaging findings**:
	- Anterioposterior and lateral X-ray films after kyphoplasty.

- **Case study 2**:
	- A 73-year-old female suffered from low back pain with left calf radiating pain and numbness for two months. Tracing back her medical history, type II diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis, and Ahlback Grade III osteoarthritis of the right knee status post total knee arthroplasty were noted. Additionally, an old L4 osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture (OVCF) status post vertebroplasty was revealed by lumbar X-ray and MRI. Due to concern about her baseline condition and risk of conventional surgery, a transforaminal full endoscopic lumbar foraminotomy decompression (FELFD) was performed to address her L4-L5 left foraminal stenosis and upward-migrated disc herniation. Her symptoms improved immediately after the surgery. One day after the operation, her visual analog scale (VAS) leg pain decreased to 2, which was 7 preoperatively. Thus, she was discharged and accepted for regular follow-up.

### Evaluation of persons with suspected lumbosacral and cervical radiculopathy: Electrodiagnostic assessment and implications for treatment and outcomes (Part I) [^116QpqRB]. Muscle & Nerve (2020). Low credibility.

Persons with back, neck, and limb symptoms constitute a major referral population to specialists in electrodiagnostic (EDX) medicine. The evaluation of these patients involves consideration of both common and less common disorders. The EDX examination with needle electromyography (EMG) is the most important means of testing for radiculopathy. This test has modest sensitivity but high specificity and complements imaging of the spine well. Needle EMG, in combination with nerve conduction testing, is valuable in excluding entrapment neuropathies and polyneuropathy — conditions that frequently mimic radicular symptoms. This first part of a two-part review presents the optimal EDX evaluation of persons with suspected radiculopathy. In part two, the implications of EDX findings for diagnosis and clinical management of persons with radiculopathy are reviewed.

### Musculoskeletal mimics of lumbosacral radiculopathy [^111hJa24]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Low credibility.

Musculoskeletal disorders are common in patients referred to electrodiagnostic medicine specialists. Not all pain that radiates to the buttock, thigh, leg, or foot arises from compression of one or more lumbosacral spinal nerve roots. Recognition of musculoskeletal disorders that may mimic radiculopathy is important to avoid unnecessary diagnostic testing and potentially inappropriate invasive procedures, thereby improving patient care and satisfaction.

### Synovial chondromatosis presenting with lumbar radiculopathy [^112TKgP1]. Spine (2009). Low credibility.

A case report of lumbar synovial chondromatosis with radiculopathy is presented. The objective is to report a case of synovial chondromatosis of a lumbar facet joint that extended into the spinal canal, compromising the lumbar nerve root and raising spinal surgeons' awareness of this unusual clinical problem.

Synovial chondromatosis is an uncommon disorder characterized by the formation of multiple cartilaginous nodules in the synovium of a facet joint. It most commonly affects large joints, but synovial chondromatosis in the spine is rare, with no previous reports of associated lumbar radiculopathy.

A 24-year-old woman presented with low back pain and right sciatica lasting 5 months. She showed no objective weakness. Computed tomography scans showed multiple calcified nodules anterior and medial to the right apophyseal joint of L5-S1, extending into the spinal canal. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a lobulated, heterogeneous enhancing extradural mass arising from the anteromedial aspect of the right L5-S1 facet joint. The lesion was removed in multiple pieces with a curette following exposure of the corresponding intervertebral space through a conventional interlaminar approach. Histologic examination showed nodules of hyaline cartilage beneath the synovial cell lining.

The patient was completely free of low back pain and right sciatica 5 days after the surgery, and all neurologic tests were normal from that point onward.

Synovial chondromatosis may compromise lumbar nerve roots when it extends into the spinal canal.

### Exhausting fatigue influences F-wave and peripheral conduction velocity, following lumbar radiculopathy [^111QiePR]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2002). Low credibility.

The purpose of the study was to determine whether mechanical nerve root compression could indirectly contribute to early muscle fatigue due to impaired activation.

- **Method**: The patients' two legs and the control group's dominant leg were subjected to exhausting foot dorsiflexion against a 2 kg weight. Electrophysiological parameters were measured under three conditions: before, upon completion of, and five minutes after the exhausting effort (i.e. causing unbearable fatigue). The study was conducted in a warm room at 24 degrees Celsius, in the EMG laboratory of a rehabilitation center using standard equipment. Eighteen patients participated in the study (12 males and six females, mean age 47.8 ± 12.0 years). They suffered from lumbar radiculopathy and unilateral complaints at the L4, L5 innervation territory. There were 22 matched controls (18 males and 4 females, mean age 44.4 ± 9.9 years) who were healthy subjects. The patients' two legs and the dominant leg of the control participants were tested. The peroneal nerve was stimulated supramaximally, behind the fibular head. Recording the activity of the anterior tibial muscle served to calculate F-wave latency, the conduction velocity of the nerve and muscle complex (NMCV), the compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitude, and the exhaustion time.

- **Results**: Following the exhausting fatigue, the symptomatic, asymptomatic, and control legs exhibited a significant decrease in NMCV and reduced CMAP amplitude (p < 0.05). In each condition (rest, effort, recovery), the patients' two leg types exhibited similar NMCV.

### Identifying lumbosacral plexus nerve root abnormalities in patients with sciatica using 3T readout-segmented echo-planar diffusion weighted MR neurography [^111mrqow]. Insights into Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

This adjunct sequence, including b-50 images, added 10 minutes to a routine lumbar spine MR protocol (7 minutes if b-50 imaging is not obtained), which is not an insignificant time penalty. However, we consider that the benefits, such as the objective demonstration of a radiculopathy, may outweigh this time cost. It may be particularly beneficial for patients when the initial clinical diagnosis is uncertain, and it may also have a useful role in assessing response to treatment.

A technical limitation of this study is that despite the MR system passing all QA performance tests, a magnetic susceptibility artifact was noted on the DWI-RESOLVE images acquired from some patients. This artifact degrades image quality and, in particular, adversely affected the quality of the DWI-RESOLVE images of nerves located at the margins of the defined FOV, typically the sciatic nerve. The artifact may obscure the affected nerve or give the false impression of asymmetric nerve signal intensity; however, it is relatively easily identified by radiologists. In this study, nerve evaluation was avoided at the level where the artifact was identified. The study showed that the L5 and S1 nerves were principally affected compared with the S2 and/or sciatic nerves, which was in line with a previous study of 97 patients with radicular symptoms that found the number of abnormalities involving the L5 and S1 lumbosacral nerves was higher than for the L4, S2, and S3 lumbosacral nerves. Of note, all patients characterized as positive with regard to nerve abnormality in this study matched the expected pattern.

### Double crush syndrome [^112g8yCT]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2015). Low credibility.

Double crush syndrome is a distinct compression at two or more locations along the course of a peripheral nerve that can coexist and synergistically increase symptom intensity. In addition, dissatisfaction after treatment at one site may result from persistent pathology at another site along a peripheral nerve. Double crush syndrome is a controversial diagnosis; some scientists and surgeons believe it is an illness construct that may do more harm than good because it emphasizes an objective pathophysiologic explanation for unexplained symptoms, disability, and dissatisfaction that may be more psychosocially mediated. However, peripheral neuropathy may coexist with compressive neuropathy and contribute to suboptimal outcomes following nerve decompression. To better manage patients' expectations, treating practitioners should be aware of the possibility of concomitant cervical radiculopathy and carpal tunnel syndrome, as well as the presence of underlying systemic neuropathy.

### Adjacent double-nerve root contributions in unilateral lumbar radiculopathy [^113Ma1tW]. AJNR. American Journal of Neuroradiology (2010). Low credibility.

Image-guided selective nerve root block/steroid injection is commonly performed for lumbar radiculopathy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical and imaging characteristics and injection response of adjacent double-root contributions to unilateral lumbar radiculopathy in a typical interventional spine practice.

- **Materials and methods**: In 132 of 350 patients (37.7%) with unilateral radiculopathy, adjacent double-nerve root block/steroid injection was performed based on preprocedural clinical and imaging characteristics. Clinical presentation, including pain pattern and VAS, response to injection, and imaging features of potential root compression or irritation (disk protrusion, subarticular/foraminal stenosis), were tabulated.

- **Results**: Clinically, a subset of patients with both L4+L5 and L5+S1 radiculopathy presented with proximal sciatica only, in addition to those with typical L4, L5, or S1 radicular patterns. Preprocedural imaging demonstrated evidence of adjacent double-root abnormality in 56 of 79 (71%) patients without prior surgery (single-level disease, 32; two-level disease, 24) and in all 53 patients with prior lumbar surgery (scar, 42; separate-level root abnormality, 13). Adjacent double-level replication of the patient's familiar pain was present in 82 of 132 (62%) patients, with single-root replication in 37 (28%) and no response in 13 (10%). Typical sciatica was encountered by injection at L4 (15%-33%), likely reflecting the furcal nerve lumbar plexus contribution from L5. Sensations from each injected root usually replicated separate recognizable pain patterns.

Electromyographic (EMG) recordings were obtained bilaterally from the target muscles, tibialis anterior (TA) and soleus (SOL). Pairs of Ag/AgCl electrodes (self-adhesive, 2 cm diameter, CareFusion, UK) were positioned parallel to the muscle fibre orientation. A ground electrode was placed over the left lateral malleolus. For TA, electrodes were positioned at one-third of the way down a line between the head of the fibula and the superior aspect of the medial malleolus; for SOL, two-thirds of the way down a line between the medial condyle of the femur and the medial malleolus. Participants were additionally asked to contract the target muscles by ankle dorsiflexion or plantarflexion to confirm that the electrodes were located over the most prominent muscle bulk. EMG data were filtered (10–1000 Hz), amplified (1000×; Iso-DAM, World Precision Instruments, UK), and sampled at 2 kHz using a Power 1401 data acquisition system and Signal v5 software (Cambridge Electronic Design [CED], UK) connected to a computer for subsequent offline analysis.

- **Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)**: TMS was delivered to the motor cortex using a Magstim 200 2 mono-phasic stimulator (The Magstim Company Ltd, UK) connected to a figure-of-eight coil (wing outer diameter 10 cm). It was positioned over the approximate location of the primary motor cortex at a site which elicited a maximal motor-evoked potential (MEP) in the contralateral target muscle.

- **Experimental parameters**: Measurements were conducted while participants were seated in an armchair with the torso supported by the backrest and feet strapped securely on a wood plate on the floor.

### Utility of electrodiagnostic testing in evaluating patients with lumbosacral radiculopathy: An evidence-based review [^111bipo2]. Muscle & Nerve (2010). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for lumbar spinal stenosis, specifically with respect to electromyography (EMG), the AANEM 2010 guidelines recommend considering the following electrodiagnostic studies to aid the clinical diagnosis in patients with suspected lumbosacral radiculopathy:

- **Peripheral limb EMG**: Obtain peripheral limb EMG for diagnostic evaluation.

- **Paraspinal mapping with needle EMG in lumbar radiculopathy**: Perform paraspinal mapping to better understand lumbar radiculopathy.

- **H-reflex in S1 radiculopathy**: Utilize H-reflex testing specifically for S1 radiculopathy.

### An algorithmic approach to treating lumbar spinal stenosis: An evidenced-based approach [^114GkY1G]. Pain Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Patients with lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) have a history of symptoms that are notable for pain and discomfort that radiate to the lower leg, thigh, and/or buttocks, a condition known as neurogenic claudication. Patients with more pronounced LSS may develop lower extremity weakness, muscle cramping, numbness, and imbalance in gait. Typically, patients report symptoms of neurogenic claudication that abate with sitting down or leaning forward, referred to as the "shopping cart sign". When spinal stenosis predominantly affects the neuroforamen or lateral recess, patients may report radicular pain following a specific dermatomal distribution. As LSS is a slowly progressing condition, the rapid onset of these symptoms may refer to a different pathology.

To confirm clinical suspicion of LSS, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) myelogram studies are required. MRI remains the most common imaging modality to assess LSS, as physical examination and x-ray imaging do not have high sensitivity or specificity. There is great variability in the description and assessment of LSS among radiologists, and a lack of standardization may contribute to increased heterogeneity of the patient population undergoing surgery for LSS. However, radiographs are low cost and readily available. Radiological anteroposterior (AP) and lateral images may show nonspecific degenerative findings such as disc height loss, disc space narrowing, and osteophyte formation, whereas flexion/extension radiographs may show segmental instability and subtle degenerative spondylolisthesis. Causes that are unrelated to back pain, such as sacroiliac joint pathology, may also be considered.

### Musculoskeletal mimics of lumbosacral radiculopathy [^113pSq1m]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Low credibility.

Physical examination tests have poor sensitivity and/or specificity for identifying radiculopathy when used in isolation, whether radiculopathy is due to disc herniation or other causes. Nevertheless, recommended physical examination maneuvers for the diagnosis of lumbosacral radiculopathy include: manual muscle testing (positive predictive value [PPV] of ankle dorsiflexion weakness 69% and lateral four toe extension weakness 76% for L4/5 radiculopathy), sensory testing (PPV 76% and 50% for sensory abnormalities in the L5 and S1 dermatomes, respectively), supine straight leg raise (sensitivity 0.67, superior to the seated straight leg raise, sensitivity 0.41), supine Lasegue's sign (sensitivity 0.77–0.83), and supine crossed Lasegue's sign (specificity 0.74–0.89).

Other physical examination maneuvers which may aid in diagnosing lumbosacral radiculopathy include reflexes at the patellar and Achilles tendons. Ipsilateral absent or reduced reflexes at the patellar tendon (sensitivity 0.18–0.67; specificity 0.66–0.90) and Achilles tendon (sensitivity 0.14–0.67; specificity 0.60–0.93) suggest patients may have L4 or L5/S1 radiculopathies, respectively.

Imaging modalities, particularly MRI, are frequently used to investigate low back pain and/or suspected radiculopathy. However, abnormalities on MRI are highly prevalent, even among persons who are asymptomatic. Consequently, resource stewardship organizations such as Choosing Wisely (USA) and Choosing Wisely Canada, as well as numerous specialty societies, recommend judicious selection of patients who require imaging.

### Diffuse age-related lumbar MRI changes confound diagnosis of single (L5) root lesions [^114RqT9H]. Muscle & Nerve (2014). Low credibility.

L5 radiculopathy has characteristic clinical and electrodiagnostic features including radicular pain; weakness or denervation of hip abductors, ankle dorsiflexors, and inverters; and pre-ganglionic dorsal foot sensory loss. It is unknown how often patients with this distinctive clinical-electrodiagnostic presentation have isolated L5-root compression on neuroimaging or more widespread, possibly age-related, lumbar neuroforaminal or spinal stenosis.

- **Methods**: A study-blinded neuroradiologist quantitated lumbosacral neuroforaminal, lateral recess, and spinal stenosis in 26 consecutive patients with unilateral, clinically and EMG-ascertained L5 monoradiculopathy, and quantitated a global neuroforaminal and spinal stenosis score (SSS).

- **Results**: Only 9 patients (35%) had isolated L5-root compression, 14 (54%) had multi-root compression, and 3 (12%) had normal neuroimaging. Increasing age correlated with SSS, and the 9 patients with isolated L5-root compression were significantly younger than patients with multi-root involvement.

- **Conclusions**: This study underscores the role of clinical and electrodiagnostic data when interpreting lumbosacral neuroimaging, particularly in older patients.

### Clinical reasoning: A 61-year-old man with progressive right leg numbness and weakness [^111WRb8K]. Neurology (2024). High credibility.

Approaching patients with lumbosacral plexopathies or radiculoplexus neuropathies can be challenging, and a well-defined strategy considering specific etiologies is necessary to arrive at the correct diagnosis. In this case, a 61-year-old man presented with a 10-year history of slowly progressive right lower extremity numbness and weakness. His examination was marked by right lower extremity weakness, decreased temperature/pinprick and proprioceptive/vibratory sensations, hypotonia, muscle atrophy, and absent right patellar and ankle deep tendon reflexes. His workup was notable for electrodiagnostic findings of chronic lumbosacral radiculoplexus neuropathy and neuroimaging revealing marked enlargement, T2 signal abnormality, and faint contrast enhancement in multiple nerves. A targeted fascicular nerve biopsy yielded the final diagnosis of a rare disease. This case highlights the differential diagnoses of lumbosacral plexopathies or radiculoplexus neuropathies, including a guided workup. We also discuss the typical features of a rare diagnosis and its therapeutic options.

### Root compression on MRI compared with clinical findings in patients with recent onset cervical radiculopathy [^115g9pgr]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

To evaluate the occurrence of symptomatic and asymptomatic root compression caused by herniated discs and spondylotic foraminal stenosis by MRI in patients with recent onset cervical radiculopathy, researchers conducted a study with 78 patients who had symptoms and signs of cervical radiculopathy for less than one month.

The authors determined the clinically suspected level of root compression in each patient. Two neuroradiologists independently evaluated MRIs, blinded to the clinical findings. For each patient, the level of root compression seen on MRI was compared with the clinically affected level. The study also examined the cause of compression, whether it was due to a herniated disc, spondylotic foraminal stenosis, or both.

In 73% of patients, the clinically affected root was compressed on MRI. In 45%, MRI showed root compression without a clinical substrate, along with or to a lesser extent without, the coexistence of compression of the clinically affected root. MRIs were assessed as normal in 13–15% of cases. In 9–10%, only asymptomatic roots were compressed. Herniated discs without spondylosis were more often responsible for root compressions only at the clinically affected level, while spondylotic foraminal stenosis was responsible for multiple root compressions, including compression of clinically unaffected roots.

The study concludes that MRI findings in patients with cervical radiculopathy should be interpreted together with clinical findings, as false-positive and false-negative MRIs occur rather frequently.

### Chronic tophaceous gout mimicking widespread metastasis [^112KmsjV]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Gout is a common crystal-induced arthropathy affecting mainly the joints of the appendicular skeleton; however, rarely this condition affects the axial skeleton as well. Spinal gout can cause radiculopathy, cord compression, canal stenosis, and discitis. We describe a case of a 71-year-old woman where the initial presentation of destructive arthropathy and spinal masses secondary to axial gout was mistaken for a metastatic malignancy. Despite chronic polyarthropathy and bilateral subcutaneous gouty tophi, spinal gout was not considered a differential diagnosis during the initial assessment. The patient was managed conservatively with pharmacological treatment, resulting in improvement of her upper limb radiculopathy and systemic joint pain, although there was little improvement in mobility. Such extensive involvement is rare, and the masses can mimic an underlying metastatic disease. Careful history and clinical examination recognizing polyarthropathy and subcutaneous tophi can aid the clinician in making the correct diagnosis and instituting appropriate treatment. Delay in recognizing gout as a differential diagnosis can lead to marked morbidity, as illustrated in our case.

### Efgartigimod as add-on treatment in refractory Guillain-Barré syndrome: A case report [^115ziHjH]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

The patient's medical history was unremarkable, apart from having undergone sequestrectomy 2 months prior for L5 radiculopathy.

Nerve conduction studies (NCS) revealed an increase in distal latencies, a reduction in conduction velocities, and reduced persistence of F waves. The sural nerve sensory action potential (SAP) was normal.

Cerebrospinal fluid analysis, performed 6 hours after admission, showed normal findings, whereas whole spinal cord MRI indicated gadolinium enhancement of the cauda equina.

The patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit because she was tetraplegic, requiring intubation, mechanical ventilation, and a nasogastric tube for nutrition. The next morning, PLEX was started at 3 L/session on alternate days, for a total of five sessions. Tracheostomy was performed 8 days after admission, and a gastrostomy was positioned 14 days after admission. At the end of PLEX treatment, the patient remained severely tetraparetic and mechanically ventilated.

Blood tests, including white and red blood cell count, electrophoresis, and reactive C protein, along with serological tests for IgM and IgG for Cytomegalovirus, Epstein–Barr virus, and Hepatitis E, were all negative. Serum collected at admission was tested for anti-ganglioside antibodies (GM‐1 IgG and IgM, GT1a IgG and IgM, GD1a IgG and IgM, GD1b IgG and IgM, GQ1b IgG and IgM), and antibodies directed against nodal/paranodal structures (Caspr‐1, Contactin‐1, Neurofascin‐155 and ‐186), all yielding negative results.

At day 14, NCS demonstrated inexcitable nerves in the lower limbs and a severe reduction of compound muscle action potential (CMAP) of median and u.

### F-waves of peroneal and tibial nerves in the differential diagnosis and follow-up evaluation of L5 and S1 radiculopathies [^114RM2qH]. European Spine Journal (2018). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to investigate F-wave as a method to identify a specific root lesion of L5 or S1 and to quantitatively evaluate the severity and progression of motor root lesions in lumbosacral radiculopathies (LR).

- **Methods**: Both peroneal and tibial F-waves were performed bilaterally in 142 patients with unilateral L5 or S1 radiculopathies and 37 controls, along with Medical Research Council (MRC) evaluation. Soleus H-reflexes were tested bilaterally in 78 of these 142 cases. Both F-wave and MRC were re-evaluated approximately one year after the initial examination in 65 patients.

- **Results**: Abnormal peroneal F-waves were found in 34 patients with L5 radiculopathy (34/67, 50.7%), along with normal tibial F-waves and soleus H-reflexes in all tested cases. In contrast, 27 patients with S1 radiculopathy presented abnormal tibial F-waves (27/76, 36.0%), with normal peroneal F-waves in all 76 cases, and abnormal soleus H-reflexes in 38 of 47 (80.9%) cases. There were significant differences in involved side F-duration among different MRC scales in both radiculopathy groups (P < 0.05). Follow-up analysis demonstrated slow progression of both F-wave abnormalities and muscle weakness in patients undergoing conservative treatment (P < 0.05).

- **Conclusions**: Comparing F-waves between the same nerve on both sides and between peroneal and tibial nerves in the same leg may clearly increase the validity of F-waves for evaluating a specific motor root lesion of L5 or S1. Furthermore, a quantitative comparison of F-waves may provide additional information on the severity of individual root lesions.

### Clinical evidence of chemical radiculopathy [^114d1og5]. Pain Physician (2002). Low credibility.

It is universally accepted that an anatomic abnormality, such as a herniated disc or spinal stenosis, can lead to radicular leg pain. There is some controversy as to whether radicular pain can be caused by a non-structural, solely biochemical disorder. Prior studies using biochemical analysis of inflammatory mediators of the disc or surrounding structures have enumerated many possible biochemical mediators of radicular pain. However, such studies have not definitively demonstrated whether these inflammatory mediators are the causes of radicular pain or whether these mediators are simply products of the degenerative cascade.

The purpose of this paper is to report upon patients who satisfy strict criteria affirming a diagnosis of radiculopathy in the presence of normal imaging studies. The study was designed as a prospective case series of patients fulfilling inclusion and exclusion criteria at a university hospital outpatient physiatric spine practice. Inclusion criteria consisted of symptoms of extremity pain greater than axial pain, examination findings demonstrating a new myotomal deficit correlating with the root level predicted by the dermatomal pain distribution, and failure to improve after at least four weeks of active physical therapy. Magnetic resonance imaging, void of local nerve root pathology as reviewed by the first author and the interpreting radiologist, was required. Each patient had to exhibit a positive electromyographic study for acute radiculopathy and a positive fluoroscopically guided diagnostic selective nerve root block.

### Clinical applications of diffusion magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbar foraminal nerve root entrapment [^115PZqGC]. European Spine Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) can provide valuable structural information about tissues that may be useful for clinical applications in evaluating lumbar foraminal nerve root entrapment. Our purpose was to visualize the lumbar nerve root, analyze its morphology, and measure its apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in healthy volunteers and patients with lumbar foraminal stenosis using 1.5-T magnetic resonance imaging. Fourteen patients with lumbar foraminal stenosis and 14 healthy volunteers were studied. Regions of interest were placed at the fourth and fifth lumbar root at dorsal root ganglia and distal spinal nerves (at L4 and L5) and the first sacral root and distal spinal nerve (S1) on DWI to quantify mean ADC values. The anatomic parameters of the spinal nerve roots can also be determined by neurography. In patients, mean ADC values were significantly higher in entrapped roots and distal spinal nerves than in intact ones. Neurography also showed abnormalities such as nerve indentation, swelling, and running transversely in their course through the foramen. In all patients, leg pain was ameliorated after selective decompression (n = 9) or nerve block (n = 5). We demonstrated the first use of DWI and neurography of human lumbar nerves to visualize and quantitatively evaluate lumbar nerve entrapment with foraminal stenosis. We believe that DWI is a potential tool for the diagnosis of lumbar nerve entrapment.

### Musculoskeletal mimics of lumbosacral radiculopathy [^1125kYvd]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Low credibility.

Electrodiagnostic evaluations are commonly requested for patients with suspected radiculopathy. Understanding lower extremity musculoskeletal conditions is essential for electrodiagnostic medicine specialists, as musculoskeletal disorders often mimic or coexist with radiculopathy. This review delineates radicular pain from other types originating from the lumbosacral spine and describes musculoskeletal conditions frequently mimicking radiculopathy, such as those that cause radiating pain and sensorimotor dysfunction.

In clinical evaluation, a history of pain radiating along a specific dermatomal territory with associated sensory disturbance suggests radiculopathy. Physical examination findings consistent with radiculopathy include myotomal weakness, depressed or absent muscle stretch reflexes, focal atrophy along a discrete nerve root territory, and potentially positive dural tension maneuvers like the straight leg raise.

However, electrodiagnostic medicine specialists must be knowledgeable of musculoskeletal mimics, which may manifest as incomplete radiation within or beyond a dermatomal territory, non-radiating pain, tenderness, and give-way weakness, in the context of a normal neurological examination. A systematic approach to musculoskeletal examination is vital, and this review focuses on high-yield physical examination maneuvers and diagnostic investigations to differentiate between musculoskeletal conditions and radiculopathy. This approach ensures accurate diagnoses, promotes resource stewardship, enhances patient satisfaction, and optimizes care delivery.

### Identifying lumbosacral plexus nerve root abnormalities in patients with sciatica using 3T readout-segmented echo-planar diffusion weighted MR neurography [^116rT7iX]. Insights into Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

A 63-year-old man is suffering from severe right leg pain and numbness. DWI-RESOLVE images with b values of 50, 500, and 800 are presented. The arrows on each of the b-value images correlate to the right L5 nerve root. The nerve was evaluated by both readers on axial DWI-RESOLVE images as positive for abnormality, graded as IV for abnormal size and signal intensity. Sagittal T2W TSE of the lumbar spine demonstrates no significant disc herniation or other potential cause for symptoms. The color-mapped image demonstrates the asymmetry of the right L5 nerve where long arrows indicate the abnormal right L5 nerve and short arrows indicate the normal contralateral left L5 nerve.

The inter-observer agreement κ for each nerve graded by the readers was calculated. The κ values revealed excellent inter-observer agreement for the evaluation of all lumbosacral nerve abnormalities for the DWI-RESOLVE sequence, ranging from 0.87 to 0.94. Inter-observer agreement values were 0.92 (95% CI: 0.87–0.97), 0.87 (95% CI: 0.75–0.99), 0.94 (95% CI: 0.85–1.0), and 0.93 (95% CI: 0.8–1.1) for L5, S1, S2, and the sciatic nerve, respectively.

### Rare extraspinal cause of acute lumbar radiculopathy [^111wzs63]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

A 60-year-old man presented to an outpatient pain management clinic with an antalgic gait and left lower extremity (LLE) radiculopathy from an unknown etiology. A lumbar MRI revealed minimal disc protrusion at L3 and a partially visualized left-sided kidney abnormality. Abdominal and pelvic CT demonstrated severe hydronephrosis of the left kidney compressing the left psoas major. The patient was immediately referred to an outside hospital for a nephrology workup, and following nephrostomy tube insertion, his radicular pain resolved. He remained asymptomatic at the four-week follow-up.

We found two cases of postsurgical, retroperitoneal fluid collections that caused lumbar radiculopathy, but none associated with hydronephrosis. To our knowledge, this is the first case in the literature to report hydronephrosis as the potential etiology of lumbar radiculopathy. This highlights an important clinical reminder: consider extraspinal etiologies in all patients who present with lumbar radiculopathy when clinical symptoms, examination findings, and diagnostic studies present with unusual characteristics.

### Imaging of lumbar spinal surgery complications [^111KfCik]. Insights into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Patient with L5–S1 laminectomy and discectomy. Sagittal and axial T2 weighted images (a and b) show hypointense soft tissue in the left lateral recess. Postcontrast image (c) shows a centrally non-enhancing disc surrounded by more infiltrating, enhancing granulation tissue along the left lateral aspect of the canal and left lateral recess.

Assessment of new diseases or disease progression should not be performed in the immediate postoperative period. Early postdisectomy changes with annulus fibrosis, epidural space edema, and granulation tissue can resemble the preoperative appearance in 80% of the patients. Even when there is residual or reherniation, this may be stable and asymptomatic or spontaneously regress. Similarly, epidural fibrosis is frequently asymptomatic. Some authors have described epidural fibrosis as a radiological entity independent of clinical symptoms, while others have concluded that diffuse epidural scarring correlates to symptoms, but small focal scarring does not. Epidural scarring may be occult on MR, evident only on epiduroscopy; thus epiduroscopy may be considered to evaluate for fibrosis in symptomatic patients with negative MR findings. Discernment between fibrosis and reherniation is of clinical value as reoperation may be beneficial in reherniation but not fibrosis.

Sterile arachnoiditis is a cause of persistent pain in 6–16% of postsurgical cases. Arachnoiditis has a spectrum of MR imaging findings with variable enhancement of clumped nerve roots, an "empty" thecal sac with the nerve adhered to the dural walls, or mass.

### Diagnostic challenges in hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis with polyneuropathy: avoiding misdiagnosis of a treatable hereditary neuropathy [^111wUq3K]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Hereditary transthyretin (ATTR) amyloidosis was misdiagnosed in 49 out of 150 cases (32%). The common alternative diagnoses considered were chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), lumbar and sacral radiculopathy, lumbar canal stenosis, paraproteinaemic peripheral neuropathy, AL amyloidosis, and other causes of acquired neuropathy.

Thirty patients (61%) received immune therapy, which included intravenous immunoglobulins (22 patients, 45%), steroids (25 patients, 51%), and immune suppressors (6 patients, 12%) or a combination of these treatments (22 cases, 45%) without clinical improvement. Moreover, 11 patients (22%) previously diagnosed with lumbar spinal stenosis and radiculopathy secondary to degenerative spine disorder underwent spine surgery with no or only transient clinical improvement of symptoms.

The delay from disease onset to correct diagnosis was significantly longer in misdiagnosed patients compared to those not misdiagnosed (46.4 ± 25.4 months vs 34.7 ± 26 months; p = 0.01).

- **Factors associated with misdiagnosis**: In a multivariate logistic regression model, late onset after 55 years, absence of family history, male gender, and absence of symptomatic heart involvement were independently linked with misdiagnosis. Notably, autonomic dysfunction, small fiber neuropathy symptoms, and mutation type (Val30Met vs non-Val30Met) were not associated with misdiagnosis.

Seventy-six patients underwent a tissue biopsy before being referred to our center. The tissue biopsy failed to demonstrate amyloid deposit in 9 out of 35 nerve biopsies (25%) and 15 out of 32 fat pad biopsies (47%).

### Musculoskeletal mimics of lumbosacral radiculopathy [^117X8FP5]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Low credibility.

Radiculopathy is a syndrome of neurological impairment of sensory and/or motor function of a spinal nerve root that arises from nerve root injury or compression. Patients' symptoms and signs vary depending on which nerve root is affected, as outlined in Table 1 and Figure 1. Although the precise frequency of lumbosacral radiculopathies is unknown, the vast majority involve the L5 and/or S1 nerve roots, as the L4/L5 and L5/S1 intervertebral discs are the most likely to herniate. Depending on the direction of herniation, either the L5 and/or S1 nerve root can be affected. Like radiculopathy from disc herniation, radiculopathy due to other etiologies, including degenerative spondyloarthropathy, typically resolves spontaneously in weeks to months but may persist in some patients.

- **Common features of radiculopathies by level**: Radiculopathy often, but not always, includes radiating pain and/or sensory loss along dermatomal territories and can be termed "sciatica" by patients and healthcare providers. The character of the pain may be neuropathic — burning, electric — or may be described as dull or aching. Patients may or may not have concomitant low back pain. Factors on history that correlate highly with nerve root impingement on imaging and/or radiculopathy on EDX include pain that radiates within a specific dermatome (odds ratio [OR] 4.1), pain with coughing or sneezing (OR 3.2), subjective muscle weakness (OR 2.2), and subjective sensory loss (OR 2.1).
