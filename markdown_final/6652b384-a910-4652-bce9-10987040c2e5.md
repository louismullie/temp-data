## Question

Paxlovid instructions

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir) instructions, including indication, timing, dosing by renal function, administration, drug interactions, special populations, safety, and patient counseling. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the FDA-labeled indication and scope of use. Then, I should verify the timing of initiation relative to symptom onset. Next, I will review standard adult dosing and then renal dose adjustments, including any discrepancies between FDA labeling and IDSA guidance. After that, I need to check administration instructions and what to do if a dose is missed. I will then examine drug–drug interactions, contraindications, and monitoring. Finally, I should consider special populations, safety signals including rebound, and synthesize practical counseling points with appropriate citations throughout.

> Let me first confirm the indication and scope of use. Paxlovid is indicated for treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in adults and pediatric patients aged 12 years and older weighing at least 40 kg who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death, and it is not approved for pre-exposure or post-exposure prophylaxis, so I need to ensure we do not overextend its use beyond treatment in eligible outpatients [^1131pYvb] [^115RQKHX].

> Wait, let me verify the timing because this is critical for efficacy. Treatment should be initiated as soon as possible after a positive COVID-19 test and within 5 days of symptom onset, even if symptoms are mild, to preserve antiviral activity during the early viral replication phase; delays beyond 5 days are generally not recommended outside of exceptional circumstances, so I should double-check that the clock starts at symptom onset, not test date, when advising patients [^115AUa3d] [^112eotbS].

> I will now examine the standard adult dosing. The recommended regimen is 300 mg nirmatrelvir (two 150 mg tablets) plus 100 mg ritonavir (one 100 mg tablet) taken together orally every 12 hours for 5 days; I need to ensure both components are coadministered because ritonavir boosts nirmatrelvir exposure and omitting ritonavir risks subtherapeutic levels and treatment failure [^111zKNif] [^111Ddqnq].

> Hold on, I should verify renal dose adjustments because this is a frequent source of errors. For moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30–59 mL/min), the dose is reduced to 150 mg nirmatrelvir with 100 mg ritonavir every 12 hours for 5 days; for severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min), including hemodialysis, the FDA labeling supports a further reduced regimen of 300 mg/100 mg on Day 1 followed by 150 mg/100 mg once daily on Days 2–5, with doses given after dialysis on dialysis days, so I should confirm eGFR before prescribing and specify the numeric doses of each component on the prescription to avoid dispensing errors [^1178k9w5] [^111zKNif]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought severe renal impairment was an absolute contraindication; that aligns with older IDSA guidance recommending against use when eGFR is less than 30 mL/min, but the FDA label does provide a reduced-dose regimen for severe impairment, so I should reconcile this by noting the FDA allows reduced dosing while some expert guidelines still advise against use in severe renal disease pending additional data, and I should document the rationale if I deviate from guideline recommendations [^113KMK6C] [^1145yERo] [^1178k9w5].

> Next, I should review administration instructions and adherence. Tablets should be swallowed whole with or without food at approximately the same times each day; if a dose is missed within 8 hours, take it as soon as possible and resume the normal schedule, but if more than 8 hours have passed, skip the missed dose and do not double up, and I need to emphasize completing the full 5-day course and maintaining isolation per public health guidance to maximize viral clearance and minimize transmission [^1178k9w5] [^115AUa3d].

> I need to check drug–drug interactions carefully because ritonavir is a strong CYP3A inhibitor. Prior to prescribing, I should review all prescription, OTC, and herbal products, hold or adjust interacting drugs as needed, and avoid strong CYP3A inducers that can reduce Paxlovid levels; high-risk interactions include certain antiarrhythmics, ergots, statins like lovastatin/simvastatin, immunosuppressants such as tacrolimus and cyclosporine, and many others, so I should use authoritative interaction resources and consider alternatives or temporary interruption of interacting medications when feasible [^111GTV4R] [^115VkDcr] [^115bDMR2].

> But wait, what about special populations and scenarios. In pregnancy and lactation, available data suggest low transfer into breast milk and no clear safety signals in observational cohorts, and professional societies increasingly support use in pregnant patients at high risk given the maternal–fetal benefits of preventing severe disease; I should counsel on infant monitoring if breastfeeding and align with obstetric guidance and patient preference [^116jSSsU] [^116iPmXa] [^1153D351]. For pediatrics, the labeled indication applies to those aged 12 years and older and weighing at least 40 kg, with adult dosing used; for children under 12 or under 40 kg, remdesivir is generally preferred, and pediatric-specific Paxlovid data remain limited, so I should confirm age and weight before prescribing [^115RQKHX] [^115DxuHG]. For patients with HIV, coadministration with existing ritonavir- or cobicistat-containing regimens is acceptable without dose changes, but I should monitor for additive adverse effects and counsel on the theoretical risk of HIV protease inhibitor resistance if HIV is uncontrolled, reinforcing the need to assess HIV status and antiretroviral therapy [^1124k7zU] [^111HhdyJ].

> I should confirm hepatic impairment considerations. No dose adjustment is recommended for mild or moderate hepatic impairment, but severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) is not recommended due to lack of data, so I should screen liver disease history and avoid use in severe impairment [^116oPo2D].

> Next, I should review safety signals and the rebound phenomenon. Common adverse effects include dysgeusia and diarrhea, and randomized data show rebound of viral RNA or symptoms occurs in a minority of patients with similar frequencies in treated and placebo groups, generally not associated with hospitalization or death; rare treatment-emergent Mpro substitutions with reduced susceptibility have been observed, but surveillance shows no concerning rise in resistance to date, so I should reassure patients while advising symptom monitoring after treatment [^1122RAcQ] [^111xDZ5W] [^114gbFEr].

> Hold on, I should verify what to do if the patient deteriorates or requires hospitalization. If a patient progresses to severe or critical COVID-19 after starting Paxlovid, the full 5-day outpatient course can be completed per clinician discretion, recognizing that inpatient management shifts toward corticosteroids, remdesivir, and supportive care rather than continuing oral antivirals as primary therapy [^115AUa3d] [^115D5xaw].

> Finally, I need to ensure comprehensive patient counseling. I will explain the 5-day regimen, timing relative to symptom onset, renal dose adjustments, what to do if a dose is missed, the importance of completing the course, and isolation guidance; I will also warn about taste disturbance and GI upset, review all medications for interactions, advise on contraception because ritonavir may reduce efficacy of combined hormonal contraceptives, and provide a written interaction list and emergency contact for adverse effects or questions [^1178k9w5] [^115d27oE] [^116jSSsU].

## References

### Nirmatrelvir and ritonavir (Paxlovid) [^115AUa3d]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The 5-day treatment course of PAXLOVID should be initiated as soon as possible after a diagnosis of COVID-19 has been made, and within 5 days of symptom onset even if baseline COVID-19 symptoms are mild. Should a patient require hospitalization due to severe or critical COVID-19 after starting treatment with PAXLOVID, the patient should complete the full 5-day treatment course per the healthcare provider's discretion.

If the patient misses a dose of PAXLOVID within 8 hours of the time it is usually taken, the patient should take it as soon as possible and resume the normal dosing schedule. If the patient misses a dose by more than 8 hours, the patient should not take the missed dose and instead take the next dose at the regularly scheduled time. The patient should not double the dose to make up for a missed dose.

PAXLOVID (both nirmatrelvir and ritonavir tablets) can be taken with or without food [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The tablets should be swallowed whole and not chewed, broken, or crushed.

2.2	Recommended Dosage

The recommended dosage for PAXLOVID is 300 mg nirmatrelvir (two 150 mg tablets) with 100 mg ritonavir (one 100 mg tablet) with all 3 tablets taken together orally twice daily in the morning and at bedtime for 5 days.

2.3 Dosage in Patients with Renal Impairment

Prescriptions should specify the numeric dose of each active ingredient within PAXLOVID. Providers should counsel patients about renal dosing instructions [see Patient Counseling Information (17)].

No dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with mild renal impairment [estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 60 to < 90 mL/min].

In patients with moderate renal impairment (eGFR ≥ 30 to < 60 mL/min) or with severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min) including those requiring hemodialysis, the dosage of PAXLOVID should be reduced as shown in Table 1. PAXLOVID should be administered at approximately the same time each day for 5 days. On days patients with severe renal impairment undergo hemodialysis, the PAXLOVID dose should be administered after hemodialysis [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), and How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16)].

8.5 Geriatric Use

Clinical studies of PAXLOVID include subjects 65 years of age and older and their data contributes to the overall assessment of safety and efficacy [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical Studies (14.1)]. Of the total number of subjects in the integrated dataset consisting of EPIC-HR and EPIC-SR who were randomized to and received PAXLOVID (N = 1,578), 165 (10%) were 65 years of age and older and 39 (2%) were 75 years of age and older. No overall differences in safety were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in safety between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.

8.6 Renal Impairment

Renal impairment increases nirmatrelvir exposure, which may increase the risk of PAXLOVID adverse reactions. No dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with mild renal impairment (eGFR ≥ 60 to < 90 mL/min). Reduce the PAXLOVID dosage in patients with moderate renal impairment (eGFR ≥ 30 to < 60 mL/min). Reduce the PAXLOVID dose and dose frequency in patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min), including those requiring hemodialysis. On days when patients undergo hemodialysis, the PAXLOVID dose should be administered after hemodialysis [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Adverse Reactions (6.1), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Prescriptions should specify the numeric dose of each active ingredient within PAXLOVID. Providers should counsel patients about renal dosing instructions [see Patient Counseling Information (17)].

8.7 Hepatic Impairment

No dosage adjustment of PAXLOVID is recommended for patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) or moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment. No pharmacokinetic or safety data are available regarding the use of nirmatrelvir or ritonavir in subjects with severe (Child-Pugh Class C) hepatic impairment, therefore, PAXLOVID is not recommended for use in patients with severe (Child-Pugh Class C) hepatic impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Nirmatrelvir and ritonavir (Paxlovid) [^1178k9w5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Severe Renal Impairment (Including Those Requiring Hemodialysis)

To ensure appropriate dosing in patients with severe renal impairment, including those requiring hemodialysis, instruct patients that they will be taking two 150 mg nirmatrelvir tablets with one 100 mg ritonavir tablet together once on Day 1, followed by one 150 mg nirmatrelvir tablet with one 100 mg ritonavir together once daily on Days 2–5. Instruct patients to take their dose at approximately the same time each day. On days when patients undergo hemodialysis, instruct them to take the PAXLOVID dose after hemodialysis [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

Administration Instructions

Inform patients to take PAXLOVID with or without food at approximately the same time each day as instructed. Advise patients to swallow all tablets for PAXLOVID whole and not to chew, break, or crush the tablets. Alert the patient of the importance of completing the full 5-day treatment course and to continuing isolation in accordance with public health recommendations to maximize viral clearance and minimize transmission of SARS-CoV-2. If the patient misses a dose of PAXLOVID within 8 hours of the time it is usually taken, the patient should take it as soon as possible and resume the normal dosing schedule. If the patient misses a dose by more than 8 hours, the patient should not take the missed dose and instead take the next dose at the regularly scheduled time. The patient should not double the dose to make up for a missed dose [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

### Nirmatrelvir combined with ritonavir for preventing and treating COVID-19 [^111G1xkn]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Oral nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid®) aims to avoid severe COVID-19 in asymptomatic people or those with mild symptoms, thereby decreasing hospitalization and death. Due to its novelty, there are currently few published study results. It remains to be evaluated for which indications and patient populations the drug is suitable. OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy and safety of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid®) plus standard of care compared to standard of care with or without placebo, or any other intervention for treating COVID-19 and for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection. To explore equity aspects in subgroup analyses. To keep up to date with the evolving evidence base using a living systematic review (LSR) approach and make new relevant studies available to readers in-between publication of review updates.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, Scopus, and WHO COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease database, identifying completed and ongoing studies without language restrictions and incorporating studies up to 11 July 2022. This is a LSR. We conduct monthly update searches that are being made publicly available on the open science framework (OSF) platform.

Selection Criteria

Studies were eligible if they were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus standard of care with standard of care with or without placebo, or any other intervention for treatment of people with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, irrespective of disease severity or treatment setting, and for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We screened all studies for research integrity. Studies were ineligible if they had been retracted, or if they were not prospectively registered including appropriate ethics approval.

Data Collection and Analysis

We followed standard Cochrane methodology and used the Cochrane risk of bias 2 tool. We rated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach for the following outcomes: 1. to treat outpatients with mild COVID-19; 2. to treat inpatients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19: mortality, clinical worsening or improvement, quality of life, (serious) adverse events, and viral clearance; 3. to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection in post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP); and 4. pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) scenarios: SARS-CoV-2 infection, development of COVID-19 symptoms, mortality, admission to hospital, quality of life, and (serious) adverse events. We explored inequity by subgroup analysis for elderly people, socially-disadvantaged people with comorbidities, populations from LICs and LMICs, and people from different ethnic and racial backgrounds.

Main Results

As of 11 July 2022, we included one RCT with 2246 participants in outpatient settings with mild symptomatic COVID-19 comparing nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus standard of care with standard of care plus placebo. Trial participants were unvaccinated, without previous confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, had a symptom onset of no more than five days before randomization, and were at high risk for progression to severe disease. Prohibited prior or concomitant therapies included medications highly dependent on CYP3A4 for clearance and CYP3A4 inducers. We identified eight ongoing studies. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for treating COVID-19 in outpatient settings with asymptomatic or mild disease For the specific population of unvaccinated, high-risk patients nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus standard of care compared to standard of care plus placebo may reduce all-cause mortality at 28 days (risk ratio (RR) 0.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.00 to 0.68; 1 study, 2224 participants; estimated absolute effect: 11 deaths per 1000 people receiving placebo compared to 0 deaths per 1000 people receiving nirmatrelvir/ritonavir; low-certainty evidence, and admission to hospital or death within 28 days (RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.27; 1 study, 2224 participants; estimated absolute effect: 61 admissions or deaths per 1000 people receiving placebo compared to eight admissions or deaths per 1000 people receiving nirmatrelvir/ritonavir; low-certainty evidence). Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus standard of care may reduce serious adverse events during the study period compared to standard of care plus placebo (RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.41; 1 study, 2224 participants; low-certainty evidence). Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus standard of care probably has little or no effect on treatment-emergent adverse events (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.10; 1 study, 2224 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and probably increases treatment-related adverse events such as dysgeusia and diarrhoea during the study period compared to standard of care plus placebo (RR 2.06, 95% CI 1.44 to 2.95; 1 study, 2224 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus standard of care probably decreases discontinuation of study drug due to adverse events compared to standard of care plus placebo (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.80; 1 study, 2224 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). No study results were identified for improvement of clinical status, quality of life, and viral clearance. Subgroup analyses for equity Most study participants were younger than 65 years (87.1% of the: modified intention to treat (mITT1) population with 2085 participants), of white ethnicity (71.5%), and were from UMICs or HICs (92.1% of study centres). Data on comorbidities were insufficient. The outcome 'admission to hospital or death' was investigated for equity: age (< 65 years versus ≥ 65 years) and ethnicity (Asian versus Black versus White versus others). There was no difference between subgroups of age. The effects favoured treatment with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for the White ethnic group. Estimated effects in the other ethnic groups included the line of no effect (RR = 1). No subgroups were reported for comorbidity status and World Bank country classification by income level. No subgroups were reported for other outcomes. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for treating COVID-19 in inpatient settings with moderate to severe disease No studies available. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection (PrEP and PEP) No studies available.

Authors' Conclusions

There is low-certainty evidence that nirmatrelvir/ritonavir reduces the risk of all-cause mortality and hospital admission or death based on one trial investigating unvaccinated COVID-19 participants without previous infection that were at high risk and with symptom onset of no more than five days. There is low- to moderate-certainty evidence that nirmatrelvir/ritonavir is safe in people without prior or concomitant therapies including medications highly dependent on CYP3A4. Regarding equity aspects, except for ethnicity, no differences in effect size and direction were identified. No evidence is available on nirmatrelvir/ritonavir to treat hospitalized people with COVID-19 and to prevent a SARS-CoV-2 infection. We will continually update our search and make search results available on OSF.

### Nirmatrelvir combined with ritonavir for preventing and treating COVID-19 [^1164vcwq]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Oral nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid) aims to avoid severe COVID-19 in asymptomatic people or those with mild symptoms, thereby decreasing hospitalization and death. It remains to be evaluated for which indications and patient populations the drug is suitable.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus standard of care (SoC) compared to SoC with or without placebo, or any other intervention for treating COVID-19 or preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection. To explore equity aspects in subgroup analyses. To keep up to date with the evolving evidence base using a living systematic review (LSR) approach and make new relevant studies available to readers in-between publication of review updates.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, Scopus, and World Health Organization COVID-19 Research Database, identifying completed and ongoing studies without language restrictions and incorporating studies up to 15 May 2023. This is a LSR. We conduct update searches every two months and make them publicly available on the open science framework (OSF) platform.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus SoC to SoC with or without placebo, or any other intervention for treatment of people with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, irrespective of disease severity or treatment setting, and for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We screened all studies for research integrity. Studies were ineligible if they had been retracted, or if they were not prospectively registered including appropriate ethics approval.

Data Collection and Analysis

We followed standard Cochrane methodology and used the Cochrane RoB 2 tool. We rated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach for the following outcomes: 1. to treat outpatients with mild COVID-19; 2. to treat inpatients with moderate to severe COVID-19: mortality, clinical worsening or improvement, quality of life, (serious) adverse events, and viral clearance; 3. to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection in postexposure prophylaxis (PEP); and 4. pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) scenarios: SARS-CoV-2 infection, development of COVID-19 symptoms, mortality, admission to hospital, quality of life, and (serious) adverse events. We explored inequity by subgroup analysis for elderly people, socially-disadvantaged people with comorbidities, populations from low-income countries and low- to middle-income countries, and people from different ethnic and racial backgrounds.

Main Results

As of 15 May 2023, we included two RCTs with 2510 participants with mild and mild to moderate symptomatic COVID-19 in outpatient and inpatient settings comparing nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus SoC to SoC with or without placebo. All trial participants were without previous confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and at high risk for progression to severe disease. Randomization coincided with the Delta wave for outpatients and Omicron wave for inpatients. Outpatient trial participants and 73% of inpatients were unvaccinated. Symptom onset in outpatients was no more than five days before randomisation and prior or concomitant therapies including medications highly dependent on CYP3A4 were not allowed. We excluded two studies due to concerns with research integrity. We identified 13 ongoing studies. Three studies are currently awaiting classification. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for treating people with asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 in outpatient settings Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus SoC compared to SoC plus placebo may reduce all-cause mortality at 28 days (risk ratio (RR) 0.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.00 to 0.68; 1 study, 2224 participants; low-certainty evidence) and admission to hospital or death within 28 days (RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.27; 1 study, 2224 participants; low-certainty evidence). Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus SoC may reduce serious adverse events during the study period compared to SoC plus placebo (RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.41; 1 study, 2224 participants; low-certainty evidence). Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus SoC probably has little or no effect on treatment-emergent adverse events (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.10; 1 study, 2224 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and probably increases treatment-related adverse events such as dysgeusia and diarrhoea during the study period compared to SoC plus placebo (RR 2.06, 95% CI 1.44 to 2.95; 1 study, 2224 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus SoC probably decreases discontinuation of study drug due to adverse events compared to SoC plus placebo (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.80; 1 study, 2224 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). No studies reported improvement of clinical status, quality of life, or viral clearance. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for treating people with moderate to severe COVID-19 in inpatient settings We are uncertain whether nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus SoC compared to SoC reduces all-cause mortality at 28 days (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.86; 1 study, 264 participants; very low-certainty evidence), or increases viral clearance at seven days (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.58; 1 study, 264 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and 14 days (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.20; 1 study, 264 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No studies reported improvement or worsening of clinical status and quality of life. We did not include data for safety outcomes due to insufficient and inconsistent information. Subgroup analyses for equity For outpatients, the outcome 'admission to hospital or death' was investigated for equity regarding age (less than 65 years versus 65 years or greater) and ethnicity. There were no subgroup differences for age or ethnicity. For inpatients, the outcome 'all-cause mortality' was investigated for equity regarding age (65 years or less versus greater than 65 years). There was no difference between subgroups of age. No further equity-related subgroups were reported, and no subgroups were reported for other outcomes. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection (PrEP and PEP) No studies available.

Authors' Conclusions

Low-certainty evidence suggests nirmatrelvir/ritonavir reduces the risk of all-cause mortality and hospital admission or death in high-risk, unvaccinated COVID-19 outpatients infected with the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2. There is low- to moderate-certainty evidence of the safety of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir. Very low-certainty evidence exists regarding the effects of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir on all-cause mortality and viral clearance in mildly to moderately affected, mostly unvaccinated COVID-19 inpatients infected with the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2. Insufficient and inconsistent information prevents the assessment of safety outcomes. No reliable differences in effect size and direction were found regarding equity aspects. There is no available evidence supporting the use of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection. We are continually updating our search and making search results available on the OSF platform.

Abstract

Background

Oral nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid®) aims to avoid severe COVID‐19 in asymptomatic people or those with mild symptoms, thereby decreasing hospitalization and death. Due to its novelty, there are currently few published study results. It remains to be evaluated for which indications and patient populations the drug is suitable.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid®) plus standard of care compared to standard of care with or without placebo, or any other intervention for treating COVID‐19 and for preventing SARS‐CoV‐2 infection.

To explore equity aspects in subgroup analyses.

To keep up to date with the evolving evidence base using a living systematic review (LSR) approach and make new relevant studies available to readers in‐between publication of review updates.

Search methods

We searched the Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register, Scopus, and WHO COVID‐19 Global literature on coronavirus disease database, identifying completed and ongoing studies without language restrictions and incorporating studies up to 11 July 2022.

This is a LSR. We conduct monthly update searches that are being made publicly available on the open science framework (OSF) platform.

Selection criteria

Studies were eligible if they were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus standard of care with standard of care with or without placebo, or any other intervention for treatment of people with confirmed COVID‐19 diagnosis, irrespective of disease severity or treatment setting, and for prevention of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection.

We screened all studies for research integrity. Studies were ineligible if they had been retracted, or if they were not prospectively registered including appropriate ethics approval.

Data collection and analysis

We followed standard Cochrane methodology and used the Cochrane risk of bias 2 tool. We rated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach for the following outcomes: 1. to treat outpatients with mild COVID‐19; 2. to treat inpatients with moderate‐to‐severe COVID‐19: mortality, clinical worsening or improvement, quality of life, (serious) adverse events, and viral clearance; 3. to prevent SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in post‐exposure prophylaxis (PEP); and 4. pre‐exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) scenarios: SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, development of COVID‐19 symptoms, mortality, admission to hospital, quality of life, and (serious) adverse events.

We explored inequity by subgroup analysis for elderly people, socially‐disadvantaged people with comorbidities, populations from LICs and LMICs, and people from different ethnic and racial backgrounds.

Main results

As of 11 July 2022, we included one RCT with 2246 participants in outpatient settings with mild symptomatic COVID‐19 comparing nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus standard of care with standard of care plus placebo. Trial participants were unvaccinated, without previous confirmed SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, had a symptom onset of no more than five days before randomization, and were at high risk for progression to severe disease. Prohibited prior or concomitant therapies included medications highly dependent on CYP3A4 for clearance and CYP3A4 inducers.

We identified eight ongoing studies.

Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for treating COVID‐19 in outpatient settings with asymptomatic or mild disease

For the specific population of unvaccinated, high‐risk patients nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus standard of care compared to standard of care plus placebo may reduce all‐cause mortality at 28 days (risk ratio (RR) 0.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.00 to 0.68; 1 study, 2224 participants; estimated absolute effect: 11 deaths per 1000 people receiving placebo compared to 0 deaths per 1000 people receiving nirmatrelvir/ritonavir; low‐certainty evidence, and admission to hospital or death within 28 days (RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.27; 1 study, 2224 participants; estimated absolute effect: 61 admissions or deaths per 1000 people receiving placebo compared to eight admissions or deaths per 1000 people receiving nirmatrelvir/ritonavir; low‐certainty evidence).

Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus standard of care may reduce serious adverse events during the study period compared to standard of care plus placebo (RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.41; 1 study, 2224 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus standard of care probably has little or no effect on treatment‐emergent adverse events (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.10; 1 study, 2224 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence), and probably increases treatment‐related adverse events such as dysgeusia and diarrhoea during the study period compared to standard of care plus placebo (RR 2.06, 95% CI 1.44 to 2.95; 1 study, 2224 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus standard of care probably decreases discontinuation of study drug due to adverse events compared to standard of care plus placebo (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.80; 1 study, 2224 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).

No study results were identified for improvement of clinical status, quality of life, and viral clearance.

Subgroup analyses for equity

Most study participants were younger than 65 years (87.1% of the: modified intention to treat (mITT1) population with 2085 participants), of white ethnicity (71.5%), and were from UMICs or HICs (92.1% of study centres). Data on comorbidities were insufficient.

The outcome 'admission to hospital or death' was investigated for equity: age (< 65 years versus ≥ 65 years) and ethnicity (Asian versus Black versus White versus others). There was no difference between subgroups of age. The effects favoured treatment with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for the White ethnic group. Estimated effects in the other ethnic groups included the line of no effect (RR = 1). No subgroups were reported for comorbidity status and World Bank country classification by income level. No subgroups were reported for other outcomes.

Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for treating COVID‐19 in inpatient settings with moderate to severe disease

No studies available.

Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for preventing SARS‐CoV‐2 infection (PrEP and PEP)

No studies available.

Authors' conclusions

There is low‐certainty evidence that nirmatrelvir/ritonavir reduces the risk of all‐cause mortality and hospital admission or death based on one trial investigating unvaccinated COVID‐19 participants without previous infection that were at high risk and with symptom onset of no more than five days. There is low‐ to moderate‐certainty evidence that nirmatrelvir/ritonavir is safe in people without prior or concomitant therapies including medications highly dependent on CYP3A4.

Regarding equity aspects, except for ethnicity, no differences in effect size and direction were identified.

No evidence is available on nirmatrelvir/ritonavir to treat hospitalized people with COVID‐19 and to prevent a SARS‐CoV‐2 infection.

We will continually update our search and make search results available on OSF.

### Nirmatrelvir and ritonavir (Paxlovid) [^111zKNif]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1	Important Dosage and Administration Information

PAXLOVID is nirmatrelvir tablets co-packaged with ritonavir tablets. There are three different dose packs available:

PAXLOVID (nirmatrelvir; ritonavir) co-packaged for oral use 300 mg;100 mg [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].
PAXLOVID (nirmatrelvir; ritonavir) co-packaged for oral use 150 mg;100 mg for patients with moderate renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].
PAXLOVID (nirmatrelvir; ritonavir) co-packaged for oral use 300 mg;100 mg (Day 1) and 150 mg;100 mg (Days 2–5) for patients with severe renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

Nirmatrelvir must be co-administered with ritonavir. Failure to correctly co-administer nirmatrelvir with ritonavir may result in plasma levels of nirmatrelvir that are insufficient to achieve the desired therapeutic effect.

Prescriptions should specify the numeric dose of each active ingredient within PAXLOVID [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3)]. Completion of the full 5-day treatment course and continued isolation in accordance with public health recommendations are important to maximize viral clearance and minimize transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

WARNING: SIGNIFICANT DRUG INTERACTIONS WITH PAXLOVID

PAXLOVID includes ritonavir, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, which may lead to greater exposure of certain concomitant medications, resulting in potentially severe, life-threatening, or fatal events [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), and Drug Interactions (7)].
Prior to prescribing PAXLOVID: 1) Review all medications taken by the patient to assess potential drug-drug interactions with a strong CYP3A inhibitor like PAXLOVID and 2) Determine if concomitant medications require a dose adjustment, interruption, and/or additional monitoring [see Drug Interactions (7)].
Consider the benefit of PAXLOVID treatment in reducing hospitalization and death, and whether the risk of potential drug-drug interactions for an individual patient can be appropriately managed [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Drug Interactions (7), and Clinical Studies (14)].

### Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (paxlovid) for mild coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in pregnancy and lactation [^116iPmXa]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (Paxlovid) is recommended to reduce the risk of hospitalization from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in pregnancy. Data on use in pregnancy, including prescribing patterns and patient experience (adverse effects, incidence of rebound), are limited. We performed a cross-sectional study in which we surveyed a cohort of vaccinated pregnant or lactating individuals with breakthrough COVID-19. Of 35 pregnant respondents, 51.4% were prescribed and 34.3% took nirmatrelvir-ritonavir; of these, 91.7% experienced dysgeusia and 50.0% had rebound (50.0% positive test result, 33.3% return of symptoms). Three of five lactating respondents were prescribed and two took nirmatrelvir-ritonavir. There were no significant adverse outcomes. Unknown risk was the most common reason for declining nirmatrelvir-ritonavir. More research is needed to establish the safety of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir in pregnancy and lactation, to improve public health messaging, and to increase uptake of this treatment.

### Impact of extended-course oral nirmatrelvir / ritonavir in established long COVID: a case series [^111yyJRq]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Prior case series suggest that a 5-day course of oral Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir) benefits some people with Long COVID, within and/or outside of the context of an acute reinfection. To the best of our knowledge, there have been no prior case series of people with Long COVID who have attempted longer courses of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir.

Methods

We documented a case series of 13 individuals with Long COVID who initiated extended courses (> 5 days; range: 7.5–30 days) of oral nirmatrelvir/ritonavir outside (n = 11) of and within (n = 2) the context of an acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Participants reported on symptoms and health experiences before, during, and after their use of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir.

Results

Among those who take an extended course of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir outside of the context of an acute infection, some experience a meaningful reduction in symptoms, although not all benefits persist. Others experience no effect on symptoms. One participant stopped early due to intense stomach pain. For the two participants who took an extended course of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir within the context of an acute reinfection, both report eventually returning to their pre-re-infection baseline.

Conclusions

Extended courses of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir may have meaningful benefits for some people with Long COVID but not others. We encourage researchers to study how and why nirmatrelvir/ritonavir benefits some and what course length is most effective, with the goal of informing clinical recommendations for using nirmatrelvir/ritonavir and/or other antivirals as a potential treatment for Long COVID.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^111go1FB]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir (Paxlovid) — indications and supporting evidence in children with HIV: "Ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir (Paxlovid) is an oral protease inhibitor (PI) that has an EUA for the treatment of COVID-19 in children aged ≥ 12 years and who weigh ≥ 40 kg who are at high risk of progression to severe disease". In adults, "ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir reduced the risk of hospitalization or death by 89% compared to placebo in non-hospitalized adults (≥ 18 years) with COVID-19 who were at high risk of progression to severe disease", and "It is unclear whether any participants had HIV". Pediatric data are emerging: "A case series of nine children who received ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir reported few adverse events and no hospitalizations after receiving treatment", and exposure is expected to be similar because "Ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir is expected to achieve similar drug exposure in adolescents aged ≥ 12 years and who weigh ≥ 40 kg as in adults, and there is extensive experience with the use of ritonavir in children". Based on these data, the guidance states the Panel "recommends that ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir should be considered in the outpatient setting for the treatment of laboratory-confirmed or clinically suspected mild to moderate COVID-19 in children with HIV who are aged ≥ 12 years and weigh ≥ 40 kg who are at high risk of progressing to severe COVID-19 due to advanced or untreated HIV or another high-risk condition as defined by CDC (BII*)".

5.1	Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions Due to Drug Interactions

Initiation of PAXLOVID, which contains ritonavir, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, in patients receiving medications metabolized by CYP3A or initiation of medications metabolized by CYP3A in patients already receiving PAXLOVID, may increase plasma concentrations of medications metabolized by CYP3A. Medications that induce CYP3A may decrease concentrations of PAXLOVID. These interactions may lead to:

Clinically significant adverse reactions, potentially leading to severe, life-threatening, or fatal events from greater exposures of concomitant medications.
Loss of therapeutic effect of PAXLOVID and possible development of viral resistance.

Severe, life-threatening, and/or fatal adverse reactions due to drug interactions have been reported in patients treated with PAXLOVID. The most commonly reported concomitant medications resulting in serious adverse reactions were calcineurin inhibitors (e.g., tacrolimus, cyclosporine), followed by calcium channel blockers.

Prior to prescribing PAXLOVID, review all medications taken by the patient to assess potential drug-drug interactions and determine if concomitant medications require a dose adjustment, interruption, and/or additional monitoring (e.g., calcineurin inhibitors) [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7)]. See Table 2 for clinically significant drug interactions, including contraindicated drugs. Drugs listed in Table 2 are a guide and not considered a comprehensive list of all possible drugs that may interact with PAXLOVID.

Consider the benefit of PAXLOVID treatment in reducing hospitalization and death, and whether the risk of potential drug-drug interactions for an individual patient can be appropriately managed [see Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Studies (14)].

5.2	Hypersensitivity Reactions

Anaphylaxis, serious skin reactions (including toxic epidermal necrolysis and Stevens-Johnson syndrome), and other hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with PAXLOVID [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. If signs and symptoms of a clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction or anaphylaxis occur, immediately discontinue PAXLOVID and initiate appropriate medications and/or supportive care.

5.3	Hepatotoxicity

Hepatic transaminase elevations, clinical hepatitis, and jaundice have occurred in patients receiving ritonavir. Therefore, caution should be exercised when administering PAXLOVID to patients with pre-existing liver diseases, liver enzyme abnormalities, or hepatitis.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information).

Drug Interactions

Inform patients that PAXLOVID may interact with certain drugs and is contraindicated for use with certain drugs; therefore, advise patients to report to their healthcare provider the use of any prescription, non-prescription medication, or herbal products [see Boxed Warning, Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), and Drug Interactions (7)].

Hypersensitivity Reactions

Inform patients that anaphylaxis, serious skin reactions, and other hypersensitivity reactions have been reported, even following a single dose of PAXLOVID. Advise them to immediately discontinue the drug and to inform their healthcare provider at the first sign of a skin rash, hives or other skin reactions, difficulty in swallowing or breathing, any swelling suggesting angioedema (for example, swelling of the lips, tongue, face, tightness of the throat, hoarseness), or other symptoms of an allergic reaction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Dosage Modification in Patients with Renal Impairment

Moderate Renal Impairment

To ensure appropriate dosing in patients with moderate renal impairment, instruct such patients that they will be taking one 150 mg nirmatrelvir tablet with one 100 mg ritonavir tablet together twice daily for 5 days [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

Types of interventions

All doses and regimens of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir were eligible for this systematic review. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir is authorized and approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) at a dose of 300 mg (as two 150 mg tablets) of nirmatrelvir with one 100 mg tablet of ritonavir, given twice‐daily for five days (EUA for Paxlovid).

We compared nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus SoC to SoC with or without placebo, or to any other intervention for treating COVID‐19 and for preventing SARS‐CoV‐2 infection including traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). We planned to investigate different active comparators in separate comparisons. Co‐interventions (SoC) must have been comparable between the study arms.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

Co-administration of PAXLOVID can alter the plasma concentrations of other drugs and other drugs may alter the plasma concentrations of PAXLOVID. Consider the potential for drug interactions prior to and during PAXLOVID therapy and review concomitant medications during PAXLOVID therapy. (4, 5.1, 7, 12.3)

7.1	Potential for PAXLOVID to Affect Other Drugs

PAXLOVID (nirmatrelvir co-packaged with ritonavir) is a strong inhibitor of CYP3A, and an inhibitor of CYP2D6, P-gp and OATP1B1. Co-administration of PAXLOVID with drugs that are primarily metabolized by CYP3A and CYP2D6 or are transported by P-gp or OATP1B1 may result in increased plasma concentrations of such drugs and increase the risk of adverse events. Co-administration of PAXLOVID with drugs highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious and/or life-threatening events is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7.3) Table 2]. Co-administration with other CYP3A substrates may require a dose adjustment or additional monitoring as shown in Table 2.

7.2	Potential for Other Drugs to Affect PAXLOVID

Nirmatrelvir and ritonavir are CYP3A substrates; therefore, drugs that induce CYP3A may decrease nirmatrelvir and ritonavir plasma concentrations and reduce PAXLOVID therapeutic effect [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7.3) Table 2].

7.3	Established and Other Potentially Significant Drug Interactions

Table 2 provides a listing of clinically significant drug interactions, including contraindicated drugs [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Drugs listed in Table 2 are a guide and not considered a comprehensive list of all possible drugs that may interact with PAXLOVID. The healthcare provider should consult other appropriate resources such as the prescribing information for the interacting drug for comprehensive information on dosing or monitoring with concomitant use of a strong CYP3A inhibitor such as ritonavir.

### Recommendations for the management of drug-drug interactions between the COVID-19 antiviral nirmatrelvir / ritonavir (paxlovid) and comedications [^113tiAj8]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) antiviral nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid) has been granted authorization or approval in several countries for the treatment of patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 at high risk of progression to severe disease and with no requirement for supplemental oxygen. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir will be primarily administered outside the hospital setting as a 5-day course oral treatment. The ritonavir component boosts plasma concentrations of nirmatrelvir through the potent and rapid inhibition of the key drug-metabolizing enzyme cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4. Thus nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, even given as a short treatment course, has a high potential to cause harm from drug-drug interactions (DDIs) with other drugs metabolized through this pathway. Options for mitigating risk from DDIs with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir are limited due to the clinical illness, the short window for intervention, and the related difficulty of implementing clinical monitoring or dosage adjustment of the comedication. Pragmatic options are largely confined to preemptive or symptom-driven pausing of the comedication or managing any additional risk through counseling. This review summarizes the effects of ritonavir on drug disposition (i.e., metabolizing enzymes and transporters) and discusses factors determining the likelihood of having a clinically significant DDI. Furthermore, it provides a comprehensive list of comedications likely to be used in COVID-19 patients which are categorized according to their potential DDI risk with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir. It also discusses recommendations for the management of DDIs which balance the risk of harm from DDIs with a short course of ritonavir, against unnecessary denial of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir treatment.

### Impact of extended-course oral nirmatrelvir / ritonavir in established long COVID: a case series [^1157DpqD]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

If clinical trials do indeed detect a signal, there should be a clear regulatory pathway to ensure that these drugs can be made accessible to patients, especially since there are currently no FDA-approved treatments specifically for Long COVID. This might entail consideration of options like expanded access, fast-track designation, and breakthrough therapy designation to both encourage industry participation and increase access of pharmaceutical treatments to Long COVID patients.

In conclusion, while the case series findings are heterogeneous, we describe the use of long courses of Paxlovid as a potentially promising pharmaceutical treatment to support at least some people with Long COVID. These cases provide strong rationale for the ongoing study of antivirals for Long COVID to determine if, when, and how they should be used in this patient population.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^1124k7zU]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

COVID-19 treatment in children with HIV — ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir use, dosing, interactions, and safety: Ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir may be administered with other ARVs, including those that contain ritonavir or cobicistat, without any interruption or modification to the child's usual antiretroviral therapy (AIII). Children taking an ARV regimen that includes ritonavir or cobicistat should be monitored for increased side effects, but doses of ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir and/or other ARVs do not need to be adjusted. Patients with untreated or poorly controlled HIV could theoretically develop PI resistance while taking ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir. Renal and hepatic function should be evaluated prior to initiating ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir, and doses should be adjusted if needed. Ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir should be started within 5 days of symptom onset (BII*) and administered orally twice daily for 5 days. Patients should be advised that a small proportion experience rebound 2 to 8 days after taking ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir, and the potential for viral rebound should not dissuade providers from offering it to patients at high risk of progressing to severe COVID-19 who could potentially benefit (AIII). Ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir has potential for drug–drug interactions due to being both a cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A inhibitor and a CYP3A substrate; providers should consult the FDA Paxlovid Emergency Use Authorization Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers, the Infectious Diseases Society of America resource, and/or the University of Liverpool COVID-19 Drug–Drug Interaction website for guidance. Other potential side effects include gastrointestinal upset (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea), altered taste, and increased blood pressure.

Intervention and Follow-Up

Participants were given VV116 oral tablets or nirmatrelvir-ritonavir oral tablets after randomization according to their treatment allocation. They were instructed to take oral 600-mg VV116 tablets every 12 hours on day 1 and 300 mg every 12 hours on days 2 through 5 or oral nirmatrelvir-ritonavir tablets with 300 mg of nirmatrelvir plus 100 mg of ritonavir every 12 hours for 5 days. Participants were required to record their intake of the study drugs in a medication log.

Starting from day 6, after completion of the 5-day course of study drug treatment, participants were asked to return every other day until day 28 and then every week until day 60. At each visit, a trained study nurse collected oropharyngeal swab samples from each participant, and the cycle threshold (Ct) value on each visit day was tested using quantitative reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) for SARS-CoV-2. In addition, COVID-19–related target symptoms were evaluated on each follow-up day using an expanded 23-item symptoms scoring system. A 4-point Likert scale was used for each symptom reported, where 0 indicated absent, 1 indicated mild, 2 indicated moderate, and 3 indicated severe, by asking the participant "what was the severity of your [insert symptom] at its worst over the last 24 hours?" The range of the overall score is 0 to 69, with higher scores indicating greater symptom severity.

In a clinical lactation study in 8 lactating women, nirmatrelvir and ritonavir were estimated to be present in human milk at a mean weight-normalized infant daily dose of 0.16 mg/kg/day (1.8% of maternal weight-adjusted daily dose) and 0.006 mg/kg/day (0.2% of maternal weight-adjusted daily dose), respectively (see Data).

There are no available data on the effects of nirmatrelvir or ritonavir on the breastfed infant or on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for PAXLOVID and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from PAXLOVID or from the underlying maternal condition. Breastfeeding individuals with COVID-19 should follow practices according to clinical guidelines to avoid exposing the infant to COVID-19.

Data

In a clinical pharmacokinetics study, 8 healthy lactating women who were at least 12 weeks postpartum were administered 3 oral doses every 12 hours (steady state dosing) of 300 mg/100 mg nirmatrelvir/ritonavir. The mean daily amount of nirmatrelvir and ritonavir recovered in breast milk was 0.752 mg and 0.027 mg, respectively, representing 0.13% and 0.014% of the corresponding administered daily maternal doses (unadjusted for weight). The estimated daily infant dose (assuming average milk consumption of 150 mL/kg/day), was 0.16 mg/kg/day and 0.006 mg/kg/day, 1.8% and 0.2% of the maternal dose, respectively, for nirmatrelvir and ritonavir.

Results

We report on the results of 13 cases who had Long COVID at the time of taking nirmatrelvir/ritonavir. Cases 1–11 (Tables 1 and 2) took an extended course of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir while negative for SARS-CoV-2, outside of the context of an acute infection; Cases 12–13 (Table 3) did so while positive for SARS-CoV-2, in the context of an acute refinfection. We also report SARS-CoV-2 vaccination history; unless otherwise noted, vaccination did not affect patients' Long COVID symptoms and patients reported no more than temporary side effects.

Table 1
Summary of cases who took extended courses of Paxlovid outside the context of an acute re-infection and experienced any improvement

For individuals indicated as having short-term improvements but not sustained improvements, this means that any improvements observed eventually dissipated. For case 4, he started valacyclovir one day before he started the long course of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, so it is difficult to determine if the benefits are due to nirmaltrelvir/ritonavir, valacyclovir, or both.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Nirmatrelvir is a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antiviral drug [see Microbiology (12.4)].

Ritonavir is an HIV-1 protease inhibitor but is not active against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Ritonavir inhibits the CYP3A-mediated metabolism of nirmatrelvir, resulting in increased plasma concentrations of nirmatrelvir.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Cardiac Electrophysiology

At 3 times the steady state peak plasma concentration (Cmax) at the recommended dose, nirmatrelvir does not prolong the QTc interval to any clinically relevant extent.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

The pharmacokinetics of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir were similar in healthy subjects and in subjects with mild-to-moderate COVID-19.

Nirmatrelvir AUC increased in a less than dose proportional manner over a single dose range from 250 mg to 750 mg (0.83 to 2.5 times the approved recommended dose) and multiple dose range from 75 mg to 500 mg (0.25 to 1.67 times the approved recommended dose), when administered in combination with 100 mg ritonavir. Nirmatrelvir steady state was achieved on Day 2 following administration of the approved recommended dosage and the mean accumulation ratio was approximately 2-fold.

The pharmacokinetic properties of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir are displayed in Table 3.

The predicted Day 5 nirmatrelvir exposure parameters in adult subjects with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 who were treated with PAXLOVID in EPIC-HR are presented in Table 4.

Effect of Food

No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of nirmatrelvir were observed following administration of a high fat meal (800–1,000 calories; 50% fat) to healthy subjects.

There were no clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of nirmatrelvir based on age (18 to 86 years), sex, or race/ethnicity.

Pediatric Patients

The pharmacokinetics of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir in patients less than 18 years of age have not been established.

COVID-19 outpatient treatment for children with HIV — ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir (Paxlovid) should be considered for laboratory-confirmed or clinically suspected mild to moderate COVID-19 in children with HIV who are aged ≥ 12 years, weigh ≥ 40 kg, and are at high risk of progressing to severe COVID-19 due to advanced or untreated HIV or another high-risk condition as defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir should be started within 5 days of symptom onset; it may be administered with antiretrovirals, including those that contain ritonavir or cobicistat, without any interruption of or modification to the antiretroviral therapy. Remdesivir (Veklury) may be considered in the outpatient setting for children with HIV who are aged ≥ 28 days, weigh ≥ 3 kg, and are at high risk as defined by CDC, and remdesivir should be started within 7 days of symptom onset, but its use could be considered in children with HIV with severe immunosuppression who have had > 7 days of symptoms. For non-hospitalized children with HIV aged ≥ 12 years at high risk, ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir is the preferred treatment, but remdesivir may be considered if ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir is unavailable or contraindicated.

At a crucial time with rapid spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Omicron variant globally, the United States Food and Drug Administration has issued an emergency use authorization for 2 oral antivirals, molnupiravir (in persons aged ≥ 18 years) and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (Paxlovid) (in persons aged ≥ 12 years weighing ≥ 40 kg), for the outpatient treatment of patients with mild to moderate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who are at risk for progression. Molnupiravir is a nucleoside analogue, whereas nirmatrelvir is a SARS-CoV-2 main protease inhibitor, and ritonavir is a human immunodeficiency virus type 1 protease inhibitor. Drug interactions are a major concern for nirmatrelvir-ritonavir. Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir demonstrated a greater risk reduction in hospitalization and death than molnupiravir compared to placebo. Both drugs need to be started within 5 days of symptoms onset and given for 5 days' duration. This article reviews the 2 oral COVID-19 antiviral drugs including the mechanisms of action, antiviral activity, pharmacokinetics, drug interactions, clinical experience including trials, adverse events, recommended indications, and formulary considerations.

TABLE 1
Characteristics of Outpatient COVID-19–Positive Patients: Treated With Paxlovid Within 0–5 Days Versus Not Treated for (Outpatient) Paxlovid Within 0–5 Days

Patients who received nirmatrelvir/ritonavir prescription ≤ 5 days of COVID-19 diagnosis ("treated") comprised 1.9% (408 of 20 959) of the analytic cohort (Table 1). The remainder included those not receiving a nirmatrelvir/ritonavir prescription ≤ 5 days of diagnosis ("untreated"; n = 20 551). Supplemental Figure 3 illustrates quarterly nirmatrelvir/ritonavir prescription counts. Within the analytic cohort, 18.3% (3837 of 20 959) patients were identified as having a chronic or complex chronic disease; of these patients, only 5.0% (190 of 3837) received a nirmatrelvir/ritonavir prescription ≤ 5 days of COVID-19 infection. The percentage of patients in the treated group who were obese (32.6%) was more than double that in the untreated group (15.1%). We also identified extremely limited use of several alternative COVID-19 therapeutics,: Monoclonal antibodies ≤ 7 days of index COVID-19 date(0.5% [∼119 of 20 959]); remdesivir ≤ 10 days of index date(0.1% [∼31 of 20 959]), and molnupiravir ≤ 5 days of index date(0.0% [below reporting threshold]). Virtually all receipt of these medications occurred among patients untreated with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir.

In December 2021/January 2022, the SARS-CoV-2 antiviral drug, nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, was authorized in the United States, Canada, and Europe. However, ritonavir has significant drug-drug interaction potential, and information resources were incomplete or provided conflicting advice for certain DDIs. Within the challenging pandemic setting, nirmatrelvir/ritonavir was being prescribed largely by clinicians unfamiliar with ritonavir. COVID-19 affects people with comorbidities and polypharmacy who could benefit from therapy, but prescriber uncertainty surrounding the appropriate management of DDIs was a barrier to the use of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir. To support clinicians, the National Institutes of Health COVID-19 Guidelines Panel, the Ontario Science Table, and the University of Liverpool independently developed prescribing guidelines. Ultimately, the groups united to establish the LiON-PK (Liverpool-Ontario-NIH Pharmacokinetics) collaboration. Here we describe how the team developed pragmatic and harmonized guidance for managing DDIs with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir. This framework may inform development of prescribing resources for other complex medications, or for future pandemic preparedness.

Certainty of the evidence

The certainty of evidence for prioritized outcomes presented in the summary of findings table ranged from low to moderate (Table 1).

We downgraded the certainty of evidence for all outcomes included in our summary of findings table due to risk of bias arising from use of an inappropriate per‐protocol analysis only including participants randomly assigned to study intervention who took ≥ 1 dose of study intervention and had ≥ 1 post‐baseline visits through day 28. Additionally, the outcomes 'treatment‐related adverse events during the study period' and 'discontinuation of study medication due to adverse events' were not prospectively registered. All‐cause mortality at 28 days and serious adverse events during the study period were further downgraded for serious imprecision due to low number of events. The outcome 'admission to hospital or death within 28 days' was additionally downgraded for serious indirectness as the study only assessed COVID‐19 related hospitalizations.

We did not consider downgrading for publication bias because the intervention is new and most of the studies are still ongoing.

We identified no study results reporting on improvement of clinical status, quality of life, and viral clearance.

### Nirmatrelvir combined with ritonavir for preventing and treating COVID-19 [^115V2NPG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Description of the intervention

Pfizer's drug combination nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid) aims to avoid severe COVID‐19 in asymptomatic people or those with mild symptoms, thereby decreasing hospitalization and death. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir is a combination of the SARS‐CoV‐2 protease inhibitor nirmatrelvir, and ritonavir, a CYP3A4 inhibitor used in the treatment of HIV to enhance HIV protease inhibitors. Nirmatrelvir blocks the activity of the SARS‐CoV‐2‐3CL pro protease, an enzyme needed for viral replication. In humans, nirmatrelvir is metabolized by the P450 cytochrome enzyme CYP3A4. In order to remain active in the body for longer periods of time, nirmatrelvir is co‐administered with low‐dose ritonavir, to slow down the breakdown of nirmatrelvir (Pfizer 2021). Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir is to be administered orally within five days of symptom onset and taken twice daily for five days. Given the inactivation of CYP3A4 by ritonavir, a common enzyme in drug metabolism, ritonavir interferes with the metabolism of many drugs, can alter their plasma concentrations, and increase drug‐related adverse effects. The applicability of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir may thus be limited in some populations at high risk of severe COVID‐19, such as those with comorbidities requiring medications metabolized using the CYP3A4 enzyme. As 3CL pro, the substrate‐binding site is highly conserved among all coronaviruses and shares no homology with human proteases, a SARS‐CoV‐2‐3CL pro antagonist will be highly specific to SARS‐CoV‐2 and less affected by virus mutations (Dai 2020) compared to antivirals binding to other sites, more prone to mutation.

### Association of treatment with nirmatrelvir and the risk of post-COVID-19 condition [^111P3oBW]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Post–COVID-19 condition (PCC), also known as long COVID, is the disease encompassing the post–acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and it affects millions of people around the world. Despite PCC affecting a substantial portion of the patient population, there is no approved medication for the prevention or treatment of PCC. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the underlying mechanisms of PCC including persistence of the virus (or its fragments) or intensity of the inflammation during the acute phase of the disease. The antiviral nirmatrelvir (in combination with ritonavir, marketed under the name Paxlovid) that has been shown to reduce the risk of progression to severe acute COVID-19 has been suggested as a candidate drug that may reduce the risk of developing PCC. In December 2021, oral nirmatrelvir was approved in the US for the treatment of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection (typically within 5 days of symptom onset) in nonhospitalized people at risk of progression to severe COVID-19 illness. Millions of people in the US have since received treatment with nirmatrelvir. Urgent calls have been made to evaluate whether treatment with nirmatrelvir in the acute phase of COVID-19 reduces the risk of PCC — but data have thus far been lacking. Addressing this question will guide treatment approaches of SARS-CoV-2 infections and will inform the effort to develop and optimize prevention and treatment strategies for PCC.

### Evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 RNA rebound after nirmatrelvir / ritonavir treatment in randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials-United States and international sites, 2021–2022 [^1122RAcQ]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). Medium credibility.

Rebound of SARS-CoV-2 shedding or COVID-19 signs and symptoms has been described after treatment with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid). The direct association of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir to COVID-19 rebound remains unclear because most reports are based on individual cases or nonrandomized studies. Viral RNA shedding data from two phase 2/3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Evaluation of Protease Inhibition for COVID-19 in High-Risk Patients [EPIC-HR] and Evaluation of Protease Inhibition for COVID-19 in Standard-Risk Patients [EPIC-SR]) were analyzed to investigate the role of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir treatment in COVID-19 rebound. Rates of rebound of SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding, identified based on an increase in nasopharyngeal viral RNA levels from day 5 (end-of-treatment) to day 10 or day 14, were similar between nirmatrelvir/ritonavir and placebo recipients. Among subjects with a virologic response through day 5, viral RNA rebound occurred in 6.4%-8.4% of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir recipients and 5.9%-6.5% of placebo recipients across EPIC-HR and the 2021/pre-Omicron and 2022/Omicron enrollment periods of EPIC-SR. Viral RNA rebound after nirmatrelvir/ritonavir treatment was not associated with COVID-19-related hospitalization or death. Data from randomized trials demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 rebound can occur with or without antiviral treatment, supporting the Food and Drug Administration's determination of safety and efficacy of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir in eligible patients at high risk for severe COVID-19.

Clinical Antiviral Activity

In clinical trial EPIC-HR, which enrolled subjects who were primarily infected with the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant, PAXLOVID treatment was associated with a 0.83 log10copies/mL greater median decline in viral RNA shedding levels in nasopharyngeal samples through Day 5 (mITT1 analysis set, all treated subjects with onset of symptoms ≤ 5 days who at baseline did not receive nor were expected to receive COVID-19 therapeutic mAb treatment); similar results were observed in the mITT2 analysis set (all treated subjects with onset of symptoms ≤ 5 days). In the EPIC-SR trial, which included subjects who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 Delta (79%) or Omicron (19%) variants, PAXLOVID treatment was associated with a 1.05 log10copies/mL greater median decline in viral RNA shedding levels in nasopharyngeal samples through Day 5, with similar declines observed in subjects infected with Delta or Omicron variants. The degree of reduction in viral RNA levels relative to placebo following 5 days of PAXLOVID treatment was similar between unvaccinated high-risk subjects in EPIC-HR and vaccinated high-risk subjects in EPIC-SR.

Timing of outcome measurement

We collected information on outcomes from all time points reported in the publications and study reports. If only a few studies contributed data to an outcome, we planned to pool different time points, provided the studies produced valid data and pooling was clinically reasonable. The current review version included one study.

In case of time‐to‐event analysis, e.g. for time to death, we planned to use the longest follow‐up time measured from randomization.

We have reported time points of outcome measurement in the footnotes of the forest plots. We included SAEs and AEs occurring during the study period, includingAEs during active treatment and long‐term AEs. If sufficient data had been available, we planned to group the measurement time points of eligible outcomes into those measured directly after treatment (up to seven days), medium‐term outcomes (up to 14 days), and longer‐term outcomes (28 days or more).

Secondary outcomes

This review specifies no secondary outcomes. All outcomes were treated as a primary outcome set which informed the summary of findings tables.

Pfizer has ongoing trials for nirmatrelvir/ritonavir on clinical outcomes for patients with COVID‐19 at high and standard risk, and for post‐exposure prophylaxis (Pfizer 2021). We expect that many new studies investigating nirmatrelvir/ritonavir will be initiated in hospitals worldwide after Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This review is designed as a living systematic review with continuous monitoring of new and ongoing studies. We aim to keep the evidence based on clinical studies investigating nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for COVID‐19 up to date.

4 CONTRAINDICATIONS

PAXLOVID is contraindicated in patients with a history of clinically significant hypersensitivity reactions [e.g., toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) or Stevens-Johnson syndrome] to its active ingredients (nirmatrelvir or ritonavir) or any other components of the product.

PAXLOVID is contraindicated with drugs that are primarily metabolized by CYP3A and for which elevated concentrations are associated with serious and/or life-threatening reactions and drugs that are strong CYP3A inducers where significantly reduced nirmatrelvir or ritonavir plasma concentrations may be associated with the potential for loss of virologic response and possible resistance. There are certain other drugs for which concomitant use with PAXLOVID should be avoided and/or dose adjustment, interruption, or therapeutic monitoring is recommended. Drugs listed in this section are a guide and not considered a comprehensive list of all drugs that may be contraindicated with PAXLOVID. The healthcare provider should consult other appropriate resources such as the prescribing information for the interacting drug for comprehensive information on dosing or monitoring with concomitant use of a strong CYP3A inhibitor like PAXLOVID [see Drug Interactions (7.3)]:

### Effectiveness of molnupiravir vs nirmatrelvir-ritonavir in non-hospitalised and hospitalised patients with COVID-19: a target trial emulation study [^111pXUKJ]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The ongoing spread of COVID-19 has highlighted the need for effective antiviral treatments. Two oral antiviral drugs, molnupiravir (Lagevrio) and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (Paxlovid) have shown promise as novel treatment options for adults with COVID-19 from phase III randomised controlled trials, namely the Evaluation of Protease Inhibition for COVID-19 in High-Risk Patients (EPIC-HR) trial and the Molnupiravir for Oral Treatment of COVID-19 in an Outpatient Setting (MOVe-OUT) trial. There is limited evidence directly comparing the effectiveness of these two antiviral treatments. Nevertheless, several clinical guidelines, including National Institutes of Health from US and National Health and Medical Research Council in Australia, recommend nirmatrelvir–ritonavir over molnupiravir, provided that patients do not have any contraindications to either drugs. Consequently, understanding their relative effectiveness profiles is crucial for informing public health policy and guiding clinical practice.

### Post-COVID condition in patients with cardiovascular disease: are antivirals the answer? [^117MyiFu]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Where do we go from this study? As new evidence emerges, eligible patients may be more keen to take nirmatrelvir-ritonavir. At present, those with pre-existing conditions who are eligible for the drug may choose not to take it. However, it would be appropriate to inform them that in observational studies, nirmatrelvir-ritonavir has been shown to reduce the incidence of PASC. Only then can patients make a fully informed decision.

On the research front, randomized studies looking at the use of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir in the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection or in those suffering from long COVID already for the sole hypothesis of reducing the occurrence or severity of PASC are currently underway (PAxlovid loNg cOvid-19 pRevention triAl with recruitMent in the Community in Norway [PanoramicNOR] RECOVER-VITAL: platform protocol to measure the effects of antiviral therapies on long COVID symptoms; A decentralized, randomized phase 2 efficacy and safety study of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir in adults with long COVID). Once those have been completed, then we can finally know the true value of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir in reducing PASC, but on the basis of the current observational data, it would seem that in the future, nirmatrelvir-ritonavir will have a role to play in PASC prevention.

### SARS-CoV-2 rebound with and without use of COVID-19 oral antivirals [^112UKNge]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). Medium credibility.

Early treatment with a first-line therapy (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir [Paxlovid] or remdesivir) or second-line therapy (molnupiravir) prevents hospitalization and death among patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 who are at risk for severe disease and is recommended by the National Institutes of Health COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines. On May 25, 2023, the Food and Drug Administration approved nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for treatment of adults at high risk for severe disease. Although antiviral therapies are widely available, they are underutilized, possibly because of reports of SARS-CoV-2 rebound after treatment. To enhance current understanding of rebound, CDC reviewed SARS-CoV-2 rebound studies published during February 1, 2020- November 29, 2023. Overall, seven of 23 studies that met inclusion criteria, one randomized trial and six observational studies, compared rebound for persons who received antiviral treatment with that for persons who did not receive antiviral treatment. In four studies, including the randomized trial, no statistically significant difference in rebound rates was identified among persons receiving treatment and those not receiving treatment. Depending on the definition used, the prevalence of rebound varied. No hospitalizations or deaths were reported among outpatients who experienced rebound, because COVID-19 signs and symptoms were mild. Persons receiving antiviral treatment might be at higher risk for rebound compared with persons not receiving treatment because of host factors or treatment-induced viral suppression early in the course of illness. The potential for rebound should not deter clinicians from prescribing lifesaving antiviral treatments when indicated to prevent morbidity and mortality from COVID-19.

### Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic-led guidance for patients with cystic fibrosis taking elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir for the treatment of COVID-19 [^113ozXiy]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

One notable therapeutic challenge is in the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2)). In people with CF, viral respiratory tract infections can lead to acute pulmonary exacerbations with a negative impact on lung function.COVID‐19 infection triggers a cytokine storm which can lead to the life‐threatening respiratory distress syndrome, potentially putting the population with CF infected with COVID‐19 at high risk of serious illness. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has recently issued an emergency use authorization for the use of the nirmatrelvir‐ritonavir (Paxlovid) for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID‐19. Nirmatrelvir‐ritonavir treatment significantly reduces hospital admissions and deaths among people with COVID‐19 who are at high risk of severe illness. Nirmatrelvir is coadministered with ritonavir, a CYP3A inhibitor, to boost nirmatrelvir concentrations to achieve therapeutic levels. However, due to the potent inhibition effect of ritonavir, it may increase plasma concentrations of drugs that are primarily metabolized by CYP3A. Therefore, coadministration of nirmatrelvir‐ritonavir is contraindicated with drugs highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which elevated concentrations are associated with serious and/or life‐threatening reactions. Since all three components of elexacaftor‐tezacaftor‐ivacaftor are eliminated mainly through CYP3A, nirmatrelvir‐ritonavir is expected to exhibit a significant drug interaction with elexacaftor‐tezacaftor‐ivacaftor. Thus, the use of nirmatrelvir‐ritonavir in people with CF would require an adjusted dosing regimen of elexacaftor‐tezacaftor‐ivacaftor to prevent increased plasma concentrations and potential adverse drug reactions. However, there are currently no clinical data available regarding the interactions of elexacaftor‐tezacaftor‐ivacaftor with nirmatrelvir‐ritonavir, and no specific dosing guidelines have been established. Therefore, there is an urgent need for the proper guidance regarding the use of nirmatrelvir‐ritonavir for people with CF to prevent progression of COVID‐19 to severe disease.

Viral RNA Rebound and Treatment-Emergent Substitutions

EPIC-HR and EPIC-SR were not designed to evaluate COVID-19 rebound; exploratory analyses were conducted to assess the relationship between PAXLOVID use and rebound in viral RNA shedding levels.

Post-treatment increases in SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding levels in nasopharyngeal samples were observed on Day 10 and/or Day 14 in a subset of PAXLOVID and placebo recipients in EPIC-HR and EPIC-SR, irrespective of COVID-19 symptoms. The frequency of detection of post-treatment viral RNA rebound varied according to analysis parameters, but was generally similar among PAXLOVID and placebo recipients. A similar or smaller percentage of placebo recipients compared to PAXLOVID recipients had nasopharyngeal viral RNA results < lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) at all study timepoints in both the treatment and post-treatment periods.

In EPIC-HR, of 59 PAXLOVID-treated subjects identified with post-treatment viral RNA rebound and with available viral sequence data, treatment-emergent substitutions in Mpropotentially reducing nirmatrelvir activity were detected in 2 (3%) subjects, including E166V in 1 subject and T304I in 1 subject. Both subjects had viral RNA shedding levels < LLOQ by Day 14.

Post-treatment viral RNA rebound was not associated with the primary clinical outcome of COVID-19 related hospitalization or death from any cause through Day 28 following the single 5-day course of PAXLOVID treatment. The clinical relevance of post-treatment increases in viral RNA following PAXLOVID or placebo treatment is unknown.

Cross-Resistance

Cross-resistance is not expected between nirmatrelvir and remdesivir or any other anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents with different mechanisms of action (i.e., agents that are not Mproinhibitors).

### Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and symptoms in adults with postacute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection: the STOP-PASC randomized clinical trial [^114cMFVc]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

The study STOP-PASC was published by Linda N Geng and colleagues in 2024 in the journal JAMA Intern Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Long COVID. In the STOP-PASC study, the trial question was: what is the role of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir in patients with post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 infection? In the STOP-PASC study, the study design was: single center, double blinded, RCT. In the STOP-PASC study, the population was: 155 patients (92 female, 63 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with at least 3 months of moderate-to-severe post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 symptoms. The key exclusion criteria were pregnancy or lactation; severe liver disease; acute COVID-19 infection; receipt of COVID-19-specific treatment within 30 days, COVID-19 vaccination within 28 days or other vaccine within 14 days of randomization; receipt of medications interacting with the study drug. In the STOP-PASC study, the interventions were: n = 102 nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (oral dose of 300/100 mg BID for 15 days) n = 53 placebo and ritonavir (matching oral placebo and ritonavir BID for 15 days). In the STOP-PASC study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in reduction in severity of 6 core COVID-19 symptoms including fatigue, brain fog, shortness of breath, body aches, gastrointestinal symptoms, and cardiovascular symptoms at 10 weeks (23.02% vs. 28%; AD -4.98%, 95% CI -10.18 to 0.22). In the STOP-PASC study, the secondary outcomes were: borderline significant decrease in Patient Global Impression of Change score at 10 weeks (3.38 points vs. 3.13 points; B 0.1, 95% CI -0.48 to 0.67) Borderline significant decrease in Patient Global Impression of Severity score at 10 weeks (4 points vs. 3.79 points; B 0.19, 95% CI -0.25 to 0.62) No significant difference in the percentage of patients experiencing relief at 10 weeks (32.4% vs. 41.5%; OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.09). In the STOP-PASC study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in adverse and serious adverse events. In the STOP-PASC study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with at least 3 months of moderate-to-severe post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 symptoms, nirmatrelvir/ritonavir was not superior to placebo and ritonavir with respect to reduction in severity of 6 core COVID-19 symptoms including fatigue, brain fog, shortness of breath, body aches, gastrointestinal symptoms, and cardiovascular symptoms at 10 weeks.

Patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 who are at high risk of progression to severe disease admitted to the hospital may also receive nirmatrelvir/ritonavir. Options for treatment and management of ambulatory patients include nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, remdesivir for a 3-day course, molnupiravir, and neutralizing monoclonal antibodies.

Certainty of the evidence

The certainty of evidence for prioritized outcomes presented in the summary of findings tables ranged from low to moderate for outpatients (Table 1), and was very low for inpatients (Table 2).

For outpatients, we downgraded the certainty of evidence for all outcomes included in our summary of findings table due to risk of bias arising from use of an inappropriate per‐protocol analysis only including participants randomly assigned to study intervention who received one or greater more doses of study intervention and had one or more postbaseline visits by day 28. Additionally, the outcomes 'treatment‐related adverse events during the study period; and 'discontinuation of study medication due to adverse events' were not prospectively registered. All‐cause mortality at 28 days and SAEs during the study period were further downgraded for serious imprecision due to low number of events. The outcome 'admission to hospital or death within 28 days' was additionally downgraded for serious indirectness as the study only assessed COVID‐19‐related hospitalizations.

For inpatients, we downgraded the certainty of evidence for all outcomes included in our summary of findings table for indirectness due to an atypical hospital population of mildly to moderately affected patients and twice for imprecision using the minimally contextualized approach.

We did not consider downgrading for publication bias because the intervention is new and most of the studies are still ongoing.

We identified no study results reporting on improvement of clinical status, quality of life, and viral clearance.

Nirmatrelvir is a reversible and time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A, but not an inhibitor CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP2D6. Nirmatrelvir is an inducer of CYP2B6, 2C8, 2C9, and 3A4, but there is minimal risk for pharmacokinetic interactions arising from induction of these CYP enzymes at the proposed therapeutic dose.
Ritonavir is a substrate of CYP2D6 and CYP3A. Ritonavir is an inducer of CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2B6, and CYP3A.

12.4 Microbiology

Mechanism of Action

Nirmatrelvir is a peptidomimetic inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro), also referred to as 3C-like protease (3CLpro) or nonstructural protein 5 (nsp5) protease. Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 Mprorenders it incapable of processing the viral polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab, preventing viral replication. Nirmatrelvir inhibited the activity of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Mproin a biochemical assay with a Kivalue of 3.1 nM and an IC50value of 19.2 nM. Nirmatrelvir was found to bind directly to the SARS-CoV-2 Mproactive site by X-ray crystallography.

### Independent FDA analyses of nirmatrelvir / ritonavir resistance in the phase 2 / 3 trials EPIC-HR and EPIC-SR [^114gbFEr]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

PAXLOVID consists of nirmatrelvir, an inhibitor of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) main protease (Mpro), copackaged with ritonavir, a pharmacokinetic enhancer. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir received emergency use authorization in the United States in 2021 and was approved in 2023. However, there is limited published information on SARS-CoV-2 clinical resistance to nirmatrelvir/ritonavir.

Methods

To investigate SARS-CoV-2 resistance development to nirmatrelvir/ritonavir in treated patients, we analyzed baseline and matching post-baseline SARS-CoV-2 next-generation sequencing data from 1862 participants (912 nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, 950 placebo) in Evaluation of Protease Inhibition for COVID-19 in High-Risk Patients (EPIC-HR) and Evaluation of Protease Inhibition for COVID-19 in Standard-Risk Patients (EPIC-SR), which were Phase 2/3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in participants with mild-to-moderate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Potential resistance-associated substitutions (RAS) were defined as those that were enriched in nirmatrelvir/ritonavir-treated participants or occurred at Mpro positions of interest, defined using nonclinical data. SARS-CoV-2 sequence databases were analyzed to characterize temporal frequencies of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir RAS in circulating viruses.

Results

In EPIC-HR, nirmatrelvir/ritonavir RAS included Mpro T21I (n = 1), E166V (n = 3), A173T (n = 1), and T304I (n = 1), with E166V being the clearest RAS observed. In EPIC-SR, no RAS were detected. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir RAS were not associated with hospitalization or death. Analyses of SARS-CoV-2 sequence databases did not reveal concerning increases in the frequencies of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir RAS over time.

Conclusions

In clinical trials, emergence of SARS-CoV-2 resistance to nirmatrelvir/ritonavir was infrequent (< 0.3%-1.1%). Surveillance data currently indicate a low frequency of circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir RAS. Collectively, these results provide the most comprehensive analysis of SARS-CoV-2 resistance to nirmatrelvir/ritonavir in the clinical setting to date. Viral sequences should continue to be closely monitored to identify the potential emergence of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir-resistant variants.

### Pharmacokinetics of oral nirmatrelvir / ritonavir, a protease inhibitor for treatment of COVID-19, in subjects with renal impairment [^113bBscr]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir (PF‐07321332)/ritonavir) is a novel, orally administered inhibitor of the 3‐chymotrypsin‐like cysteine protease (M pro) of SARS‐CoV‐2. In addition to exhibiting a high level of conservation across human coronaviruses, including SARS‐CoV‐2, M pro performs the essential role of processing viral polyproteins into functional units, and inhibition is not likely to exhibit off‐target activity due to the absence of known human analogs; thus, it is an ideal target for viral inhibition. Preclinical studies found that nirmatrelvir, given alone, is primarily metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4); nirmatrelvir is therefore administered in combination with ritonavir (Norvir; AbbVie Inc. Chicago, IL, USA), a CYP3A4 inhibitor, in clinical studies to maintain effective nirmatrelvir plasma concentrations. Nirmatrelvir in combination with ritonavir exhibited overwhelming efficacy in a recent phase II/III study (Evaluation of Protease Inhibition for COVID‐19 in High‐Risk Patients (EPIC‐HR); NCT04960202) in nonhospitalized adults with mild to moderate COVID‐19 who were at increased risk of progression to severe disease due to demographic or underlying clinical characteristics, including renal impairment. Among patients who initiated treatment within 3 days following symptom onset, nirmatrelvir/ritonavir was 89% efficacious at preventing COVID‐19–related hospitalization and all‐cause death within 28 days. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir was recently granted EUA in the United States for treatment of mild to moderate COVID‐19 in patients who are ≥ 12 years of age (weighing ≥ 40 kg) with confirmed COVID‐19 and at high risk for progression to severe COVID‐19.

Initial pharmacokinetic (PK) studies suggested that when CYP3A metabolism is inhibited by ritonavir, the main route of elimination of nirmatrelvir is by renal excretion. Chronic kidney disease is a key risk factor for severe COVID‐19 (refs.); because nirmatrelvir/ritonavir is intended for use in patients at high risk for severe disease, including those with renal impairment, this study aimed to evaluate the effects of renal impairment on PK parameters of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir. Findings from this study will influence dosing recommendations for individuals with renal impairment.

### Interactions of the protease inhibitor, ritonavir, with common anesthesia drugs [^115S7tYf]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2022). Medium credibility.

A full list of drug interactions with ritonavir is available from the UK NIH COVID‐19 treatment guidelines (Paxlovid HCP fact Sheet 03182022.pdf). A comprehensive guide to drugs that can be compromised during ritonavir administration has been published by Manzolini and colleagues. These drugs can be grouped using a traffic light system that ranges from red (do not co‐administer) through orange (potential interaction) to yellow (weak interaction) and green (no interaction expected). Drugs discussed in this current review fall under the "red or orange" classification.

Current guidelines from pediatric anesthesia societies often recommend postponement of nonessential anesthesia and surgery in children until at least 14 days after onset of COVID‐19 symptoms. This delay avoids anesthesia in the early course of the disease when nirmatrelvir–ritonavir might be given. There will be occasions when the need for medical intervention cannot be postponed and anesthesiology practitioners should be mindful of potential interactions between ritonavir and drugs used during anesthesia and adapt perioperative care appropriately.

We review drugs interactions with ritonavir in order to help guide anesthetic practice. Pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic simulation is used to demonstrate impact of interactions and why some interactions may have little clinical importance while others have major clinical impact. We demonstrate that most, if not all, anticipated effects of drug interactions relevant to anesthesia could be anticipated and dealt with if the nature those interactions were better understood.

Harms — nirmatrelvir/ritonavir emphasize safety signals and interactions: Limited evidence from hospitalized patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 receiving nirmatrelvir/ritonavir suggest increased serious adverse events and adverse events (RR 1.20; 95% CI: 0.38, 3.84; low CoE and RR: 1.40; 95% CI: 0.65, 3.04; low CoE). Serious treatment-emergent adverse events were not reported in the FDA EUA. Given co-formulation with ritonavir as a pharmacokinetic booster, there is potential for significant drug interactions. Contraindications exist between agents that can have their levels increased or decreased by nirmatrelvir and/or ritonavir and agents that can increase the metabolism of the components of nirmatrelvir and/or ritonavir, resulting in a loss of virologic response and possible resistance. These drug interactions can result in treatment failure or serious adverse events.

The study RECOVERY (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir) was published by RECOVERY Collaborative Group. and colleagues in 2025 in the journal Lancet Infect Dis. This study is related to the following diseases: COVID-19 infection. In the RECOVERY (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir) study, the trial question was: what is the role of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir in patients hospitalized with COVID-19? In the RECOVERY (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir) study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the RECOVERY (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir) study, the population was: 137 patients (60 female, 77 male). The inclusion criteria were patients hospitalized with COVID-19.

In the RECOVERY (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir) study, the interventions were: n = 68 nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (at a dose of 300 mg/100 mg PO BID for 5 days plus standard of care) n = 69 usual care (standard of care only). In the RECOVERY (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir) study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in death at day 28 (19% vs. 19%; HR 1.02, 95% CI 0.47 to 2.23). In the RECOVERY (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir) study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in the rate of discharged alive within 28 days (71% vs. 78%; RR 0.8, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.2) No significant difference in invasive mechanical ventilation or death (21% vs. 19%; RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.54 to 2.08) No significant difference in receipt of ventilation (8% vs. 17%; RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.18 to 1.33). In the RECOVERY (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in adverse events. In the RECOVERY (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir) study, the conclusion was: in patients hospitalized with COVID-19, nirmatrelvir/ritonavir was not superior to usual care with respect to death at day 28.

### Nirmatrelvir combined with ritonavir for preventing and treating COVID-19 [^115D5xaw]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

There are several therapeutic options for people with COVID‐19. Choice of therapy depends on severity of illness; drug availability; route of administration; time of onset of symptoms to starting treatment; co‐administered medication; and patient‐specific factors such as age, pregnancy, or current lactation. In people who are at the highest risk of hospitalization or progression to severe illness, including consideration in women who are pregnant or lactating, the WHO Living Guideline for Therapeutics and COVID‐19 includes a strong recommendation for use of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, in addition to symptomatic management (WHO 2023b). Alternative therapeutics for people in this group include remdesivir, which requires intravenous administration, and in some countries, the oral antiviral molnupiravir. Molnupiravir has a conditional recommendation for use by the WHO in people with non‐severe COVID‐19 at highest risk of hospitalization, excluding pregnant or breastfeeding women, and children. It is noted at the current time that the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has recommended the refusal of the marketing authorization of molnupiravir; however, this drug is available outside the EU.

Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir is not recommended by the WHO for people with severe COVID‐19; recommended therapeutics in these patients include corticosteroids, interleukin‐6 receptor blockers (tocilizumab, sarilumab), remdesivir (an antiviral), and the janus kinase inhibitor baricitinib in addition to cardiorespiratory support measures as indicated (WHO 2023b).

The WHO also has a conditional recommendation against the use of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir in people with non‐severe illness at the lowest risk of hospitalization (WHO 2023b).

The WHO currently does not recommend any therapeutic to prevent COVID‐19 in close contacts of infected patients or in other high‐risk groups (WHO 2023c).

### A mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 immunity predicts paxlovid rebound [^117Fs8Ci]. Journal of Medical Virology (2023). Medium credibility.

Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid), an oral antiviral medication targeting SARS-CoV-2, remains an important treatment for COVID-19. Initial studies of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir were performed in SARS-CoV-2 unvaccinated patients without prior confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection; however, most individuals have now either been vaccinated and/or have experienced SARS-CoV-2 infection. After nirmatrelvir/ritonavir became widely available, reports surfaced of "Paxlovid rebound", a phenomenon in which symptoms (and SARS-CoV-2 test positivity) would initially resolve, but after finishing treatment, symptoms and test positivity would return. We used a previously described parsimonious mathematical model of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 infection to model the effect of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir treatment in unvaccinated and vaccinated patients. Model simulations show that viral rebound after treatment occurs only in vaccinated patients, while unvaccinated (SARS-COV-2 naïve) patients treated with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir do not experience any rebound in viral load. This work suggests that an approach combining parsimonious models of the immune system could be used to gain important insights in the context of emerging pathogens.

Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir pharmacology and authorization — Nirmatrelvir is an inhibitor to the main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2; inhibition of this enzyme blocks viral replication, and nirmatrelvir is a substrate of cytochrome P450 3A4 co-packaged with the HIV-1 protease inhibitor ritonavir, a potent inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A4; coadministration results in higher concentrations and a longer half-life of nirmatrelvir, allowing for every-12-hour dosing. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted EUA to nirmatrelvir/ritonavir on December 22, 2021 for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in adults and pediatric patients (≥ 12 years of age and weighing ≥ 40 kg) who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death.

Children with or exposed to HIV — COVID-19 therapy for non-hospitalized children at high risk of progression to severe COVID-19 includes weight- and age-based dosing. Aged ≥ 28 Days to < 12 Years, remdesivir (Veklury) dosing is ≥ 3 to < 40 kg: Lyophilized powder only; IV loading dose: 5 mg/kg/dose on Day 1, followed by 2.5 mg/kg/dose once daily on Days 2 and 3, and ≥ 40 kg: Injection solution or lyophilized powder; IV loading dose: 200 mg on Day 1, followed by 100 mg once daily on Days 2 and 3. Aged ≥ 12 Years and ≥ 40 kg, nirmatrelvir 300 mg and ritonavir 100 mg, administered together (Paxlovid), twice daily for 5 days. Remdesivir is administered intravenously; when given to non-hospitalized patients, duration is for 3 days, and when given to hospitalized patients, duration is generally 5 days or until hospital discharge, whichever is first, but may extend to up to 10 days based on clinical response. Remdesivir should be started within 7 days of symptom onset but could be considered if presenting with > 7 days of symptoms in children with severe immunosuppression.

IDSA COVID-19 guidelines — nirmatrelvir/ritonavir other considerations state that the panel agreed the overall certainty of evidence for ambulatory treatment was low with limited study details and imprecision, and that the EUA did not report safety data; the panel agreed benefits are likely to outweigh potential harms in high‑risk patients, but drug interactions must be considered. The evidence confirms maximum benefit when used early in the disease process with high viral loads; it is critical to rapidly diagnose and treat ambulatory patients early, observational studies have shown a similar benefit among vaccinated patients infected with newer variants, and the panel recognized the need for additional evidence for hospitalized patients. According to the EUA, use may be associated with a risk of developing HIV resistance to HIV protease inhibitors in individuals with uncontrolled or undiagnosed HIV‑1 infection.

### Cardiovascular drug interactions with Nirmatrelvir / ritonavir in patients With COVID-19: JACC Review topic of the week [^1149xLpy]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (NMVr) is used to treat symptomatic, nonhospitalized patients with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) who are at high risk of progression to severe disease. Patients with cardiovascular risk factors and cardiovascular disease are at a high risk of developing adverse events from COVID-19 and as a result have a higher likelihood of receiving NMVr. Ritonavir, the pharmaceutical enhancer used in NMVr, is an inhibitor of the enzymes of CYP450 pathway, particularly CYP3A4 and to a lesser degree CYP2D6, and affects the P-glycoprotein pump. Co-administration of NMVr with medications commonly used to manage cardiovascular conditions can potentially cause significant drug-drug interactions and may lead to severe adverse effects. It is crucial to be aware of such interactions and take appropriate measures to avoid them. In this review, we discuss potential drug-drug interactions between NMVr and commonly used cardiovascular medications based on their pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic properties.

### Paxlovid for the treatment of severe or critical COVID-19 in children [^11614Rtw]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic brought over 774 million infections and 7 million fatalities worldwide. Up to now, there are still 200–300 thousand additional cases and several hundred deaths per week across the globe. Nirmatrelvir/Ritonavir (Paxlovid) has been proven effective for the treatment of COVID-19 in adults. However, clinical data on its use in children remain limited. While Phase II/III trials for pediatric patients (NCT05261139) are ongoing, no published results are yet available. Only a few case reports and small case series have assessed Paxlovid in children, with one retrospective study evaluating its safety and efficacy in 31 pediatric ICU patients, including 9 who received Paxlovid. Due to the lack of robust evidence, current guidelines recommend the use of Paxlovid in children on a case-by-case basis. This uncertainty can present challenges for clinicians in making treatment decisions.

Although Paxlovid has been recommended for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 in adults, specifically when administered within 5 days of symptom onset, its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated in severe or critical cases. While COVID-19 in children is generally less severe than in adults, children with underlying health conditions are at a higher risk for complications such as hospitalization, intensive care, mechanical ventilation, and even death. A global study involving 1,500 children with cancer found that 20% experienced severe or critical COVID-19, with a mortality rate of 3%. Given that an estimated 400,000 children and adolescents aged 0–19 are diagnosed with cancer annually, this suggests that approximately 12,000 children could potentially die from COVID-19. Therefore, providing Paxlovid to children, especially those with compromised immune systems due to underlying conditions, may help prevent the progression of COVID-19 to severe stages and reduce mortality rates.

To further assess the safety and effectiveness of Paxlovid in pediatric populations, we conducted a prospective observational study. This study included children and adolescents treated with Paxlovid, with cases stratified by severity, and followed up over a 6-month period.

Risk of bias in included studies

We assessed methodological quality and risk of bias for the included trial (EPIC‐HR 2021) using the RoB 2 tool recommended in Chapter 8 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2022a). The included trial contributed 12 study results to six outcomes. Six study results (whole study population) contributed to all six outcomes and six additional study results (subgroups for age and ethnicity) contributed to one of the six outcomes. To account for different analysis sets used for subgroup analyses in the trial, the outcome 'hospitalization or death' has been assessed for the whole population as well as the individual subgroups using ROB 2. The RoB 2 judgements for all study results per outcome and for all domains are available in an interactive risk of bias table (Supplementary File_Nirmatrelvir_Risk of Bias) and are briefly summarized below. The completed RoB 2 tool with responses to all assessed signalling questions is available online at: Supplementary File_Nirmatrelvir_Risk of Bias

Overall risk of bias by study

All 12 study results included from EPIC‐HR 2021 have been assessed as some concerns for the overall risk of bias.

Overall risk of bias by outcome

This section summarises the risk of bias per outcome for all outcomes included in the Table 1.

We have some concern regarding risk of bias for all outcomes included in the Table 1. For the outcomes 'all‐cause mortality at 28 days', 'worsening of clinical status: admission to hospital or death at 28 days', 'serious adverse events (SAEs) during the study period' and 'any grade treatment‐emergent adverse events during the study period' the included study been assessed as overall some concern of bias due to use of an inappropriate per‐protocol analysis (EPIC‐HR 2021). For the outcome 'admission to hospital or death at 28 days', we applied the respective risk of bias assessments to the subgroup analyses, as well (EPIC‐HR 2021). For the outcomes 'treatment‐related adverse events during the study period' and 'discontinuation of study medication due to adverse events' the study has been assessed as overall some concern of bias due to use of an inappropriate per‐protocol analysis and lack of prospective outcome registration (EPIC‐HR 2021).

Study Highlights

WHAT IS THE CURRENT KNOWLEDGE ON THE TOPIC?

☑ Nirmatrelvir, a novel inhibitor of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2), has shown high efficacy against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19)–related hospitalization or all‐cause death among individuals at increased risk of progression to severe disease when administered in combination with ritonavir. Preliminary data have highlighted the importance of the renal pathway in nirmatrelvir pharmacokinetics when given with ritonavir, which inhibits the metabolism of nirmatrelvir.

WHAT QUESTION DID THIS STUDY ADDRESS?

☑ This study evaluated whether renal impairment was associated with altered nirmatrelvir pharmacokinetics.

WHAT DOES THIS STUDY ADD TO OUR KNOWLEDGE?

☑ Increases in nirmatrelvir systemic exposure were observed with increasing renal impairment severity following a single nirmatrelvir dose enhanced with ritonavir, particularly in the moderate (approximately twofold higher than normal renal function) and severe (approximately threefold higher) renal impairment groups. Nirmatrelvir renal clearance was correspondingly lower in these groups. The safety profile of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir was acceptable in all groups.

HOW MIGHT THIS CHANGE CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY OR TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE?

☑ Findings from this study were used to specify dosing recommendations for nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for patients with renal disease.

Emerging treatments

As the virus becomes better understood, the therapeutic strategy against covid-19 develops. Over 2000 ongoing trials are currently assessing certain treatment strategies for covid-19. Recently, antiviraldrugs including molnupiravir (Lagevrio) and nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid) have been approved in the UK, US, and Europefor treating covid-19 in certain risk groups. Similarly, sotrovimab (Xevudy), a monoclonal antibody treatment, has recently been approved for use in treating certain patients with covid-19 in the UK, US, and Europe. These drugs have been shown to be effective at preventing poor clinical outcomes, including death, in those individuals vulnerable to severe covid-19 infection. Other drug treatments, such as janus kinase inhibitors, corticosteroids, and anti-inflammatory drugs, have contrasting evidence to support their use; therefore, the use of specific drugs is either recommended for or against by certain treatment and management guidelines, which are discussed below.

### Tacrolimus drug-drug interaction with nirmatrelvir / ritonavir (paxlovid ™) managed with phenytoin [^112KesNg]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19) pandemic has had a significant impact on communities and health systems. The Federal Drug Administration (FDA) authorized Pfizer's nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid™) through an EUA for the treatment of mild to moderate cases of COVID-19 at high risk for progression to severe disease. Patients with a history of transplant who test positive for COVID-19 are considered high risk because of their immunosuppression and are therefore candidates for nirmatrelvir/ritonavir.

Case Report

This is a case of a 67-year-old female with a past medical history of orthotopic heart transplant who received tacrolimus as part of her immunosuppressive regimen. She originally presented with complaints of dyspnea and cough for several days in the setting of COVID-19. The patient was started on nirmatrelvir/ritonavir due to her high risk for progression to severe disease. Four days after starting nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, she presented to the ED for slowed speech, fatigue, weakness, and loss of appetite. Upon admission she was found to have a supratherapeutic tacrolimus level of 176.4 ng/mL and an acute kidney injury. In this case, phenytoin was used as a CYP3A4 inducer to quickly decrease the tacrolimus level to within therapeutic range.

Conclusion

This case highlights the strong and important drug-drug interaction between tacrolimus and nirmatrelvir/ritonavir leading to toxic levels of tacrolimus. It also demonstrates the utility and effectiveness of phenytoin as a "rescue" medication for tacrolimus toxicity.

Ritonavir Interactions With ASMs

Another potential clinically relevant interaction exists between lamotrigine (LTG) and ritonavir (r), an element of the WHO recommendation for PEP. Ritonavir (r) can reduce lamotrigine (LTG) concentration by 50% within days, therefore lamotrigine dosing may need to be modified during short-term PEP treatment containing ritonavir (r). Irrespective of potential lamotrigine adjustments or decreases during PEP, the removal of ritonavir (r) may contribute to a rise in serum lamotrigine concentration. This may be associated with both transient increased adverse effects of lamotrigine, similar to those during the placebo week of estrogen-containing oral contraceptives, as well as increased risk of Steven's Johnson Syndrome (SJS). Data from withdrawal of lamotrigine during long-term inpatient monitoring suggest the risk of SJS is low if lamotrigine dosing was lower for less than 7 days, but the duration of ritonavir (r) in PEP typically lasts 4 weeks. Therefore, during this period of PEP and afterward, the dosing of lamotrigine may need to be increased and additional counseling provided regarding monitoring for SJS. In addition to lamotrigine, the European Medicines agency recently issues a warning regarding the interaction with everolimus and ritonavir, which also is an element of treatment for Covid-19 in combination with nirmatrelvir in Paxlovid.

Other ASMs and Other ARTs Without Known Interactions

In addition to highlighting the presence of known or theoretical interaction between certain ASMs and many of the ARTs used in PrEP/PEP, we emphasize that there are several ASMs without known or limited interactions. When possible, patients with anticipated need for PrEP/PEP should aim to achieve seizure and side effect freedom with these noninteracting ASMs. However, one third of patients with epilepsy have medication-resistant epilepsy, defined by failure by 2 or more appropriately prescribed and tolerated ASMs, therefore this may not be possible. Additionally, while levetiracetam (LEV) was recently added to the WHO essential medications list, these modern ASMs often are not widely available globally due to cost, regulatory approval, and supply chain challenges. Analogously, modern ARTs typically have fewer drug–drug interactions; therefore, they may emerge as preferred elements of PrEP and PEP regimens in people taking ASMs.

### Innovative randomized phase I study and dosing regimen selection to accelerate and inform pivotal COVID-19 trial of nirmatrelvir [^111QYLCF]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) is a continued threat to public health worldwide more than 2 years after its emergence. Despite availability of effective vaccines, infection rates remain high, and COVID‐19 continues to be a leading cause of hospitalization and death. Intravenously administered monoclonal antibodies (casirivimab, imdevimab, bamlanivimab, etesevimab, and sotrovimab) were the first outpatient therapies to be made available under emergency use authorization (EUA) to patients at high risk of severe COVID‐19. However, logistical constraints could affect administration, and reduced effectiveness has been observed for some monoclonal antibodies, leading the US Government to recommend not using them for some severe acute respiratory syndrome‐coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) variants. More recently, a 3‐day course of the intravenous RNA polymerase inhibitor remdesivir also received EUA for non‐hospitalized patients at risk of severe disease. Nirmatrelvir (PAXLOVID TM) is the first oral antiviral treatment authorized for the treatment of COVID‐19 under EUA. The nucleoside inhibitor molnupiravir received EUA shortly after nirmatrelvir in adults at risk of severe COVID‐19 for whom other treatments are unavailable or inappropriate. At the time of this study, no therapy that could be self‐administered at home was available to treat COVID‐19; there was therefore an urgent need for safe and efficacious orally administered therapies, particularly for individuals at high risk of severe illness.
