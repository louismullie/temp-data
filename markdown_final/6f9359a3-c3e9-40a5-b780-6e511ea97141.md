## Question

Dysfunctional uterine bleeding

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about dysfunctional uterine bleeding, preserving the thinking process and self-verification language throughout. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about modernizing the terminology and classification framework. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology and core diagnostic principles. Next, I will review the differential diagnosis using PALM-COEIN and outline the evaluation strategy. After that, I need to stratify management by acuity and patient goals, including medical, interventional, and surgical options. Finally, I should consider special populations, summarize evidence gaps, and synthesize a practical algorithm with key takeaways, ensuring each step is supported by appropriate references and self-checks along the way [^113fHGnu] [^115L1hCU] [^112Rqtnw].

> Let me first confirm the terminology shift, because "dysfunctional uterine bleeding" is outdated and imprecise; FIGO replaced it with "abnormal uterine bleeding" and standardized nomenclature using System 1 descriptors (frequency, duration, regularity, flow) and System 2 causal classification (PALM-COEIN), which I should explicitly adopt to avoid ambiguity and align with contemporary care pathways [^113fHGnu] [^115L1hCU] [^112Rqtnw].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiology; I need to check the pathophysiology. Most cases historically labeled DUB reflect anovulatory bleeding due to unopposed estrogen driving endometrial proliferation and unstable shedding, with risk of hyperplasia over time, so the therapeutic logic should target progesterone opposition and cycle stabilization while excluding structural and systemic causes first [^115EZtcu] [^11774Peq].

> Next, I should review the differential using PALM-COEIN systematically. Structural causes include polyps, adenomyosis, leiomyoma, and malignancy/hyperplasia; nonstructural causes include coagulopathy, ovulatory dysfunction, endometrial disorders, iatrogenic, and not otherwise classified, and I need to ensure I map patient features to these buckets before committing to a treatment plan [^113fHGnu] [^111FKHQz] [^112Rqtnw].

> I will now examine the evaluation framework. Let me first confirm that pregnancy is excluded in all reproductive-aged patients, then obtain a structured bleeding history using FIGO System 1 descriptors, perform a focused exam, and order a CBC to assess anemia; I should add TSH and prolactin when clinically indicated, and reserve endometrial sampling for women aged 45 or older, those younger than 45 with risk factors for endometrial cancer, or anyone with persistent bleeding despite appropriate therapy, while using transvaginal ultrasound as first-line imaging when structural disease is suspected or symptoms persist [^11774Peq] [^113KNAgg] [^112Rqtnw].

> Wait, let me verify the approach to acute AUB with hemodynamic instability. I need to ensure immediate stabilization with IV access, fluids, and blood products as needed, then consider high-dose IV conjugated estrogen, multidose combined oral contraceptives, multidose oral progestins, or tranexamic acid, escalating to uterine tamponade, D&C, uterine artery embolization, or hysterectomy if medical therapy fails or the patient is unstable, documenting the rationale for escalation at each step [^117NxJgW] [^11774Peq].

> For chronic AUB presumed secondary to endometrial dysfunction, I should double-check the hierarchy of medical options. The levonorgestrel intrauterine system achieves the greatest reduction in menstrual blood loss (about 71–95%) and is first-line when acceptable; combined oral contraceptives, extended-cycle oral progestins, and tranexamic acid are also effective, with NSAIDs offering modest benefit and often used adjunctively; I should confirm contraindications and patient preferences before choosing among these [^113YF2MP] [^11774Peq].

> Let me consider ovulatory dysfunction next. Cyclic progestins in the luteal phase can stabilize the endometrium, and combined hormonal contraception can regulate cycles; however, I should acknowledge that high-quality randomized evidence comparing progestin-only versus combined regimens is limited, so shared decision-making and individualized trials are reasonable while monitoring response and tolerability [^115p6g3S] [^11774Peq].

> I need to ensure I address fertility goals explicitly. For those desiring future fertility, I should prioritize medical therapy and avoid endometrial ablation or hysterectomy; for those who have completed childbearing, the LNG-IUS, endometrial ablation, or hysterectomy can be considered based on symptom burden, risk tolerance, and preferences, with explicit counseling on permanence and potential complications [^112J8fSX] [^11774Peq].

> Next, I should review surgical and procedural options with balanced framing. Endometrial ablation is effective and less invasive than hysterectomy but carries a meaningful reoperation risk over time; randomized data show both ablation and hysterectomy solve the bleeding problem for most patients at 24 months, with hysterectomy more effective but with more adverse events; hysterectomy remains definitive when other options fail or are declined, and pre-ablation endometrial thinning with GnRH agonists can improve amenorrhea rates, which I should discuss during preoperative planning [^114fZf2y] [^111msc61] [^112zJ6re].

> But wait, what if the patient is an adolescent or young adult. I should confirm that anovulatory bleeding is common in the first years after menarche, screen for bleeding disorders such as von Willebrand disease when indicated, correct iron deficiency, and use hormonal therapy (COCs, cyclic progestins, or LNG-IUS) as first-line; case-based reports suggest acupuncture may help selected adolescents after conventional therapy fails, though evidence quality is low and should be framed as adjunctive or alternative within shared decision-making [^115DMgHx] [^1121vm1s] [^1163tuiy].

> I should double-check special hematologic scenarios. In women with VWD or other inherited bleeding disorders, hormonal therapy (CHC or LNG-IUS) or tranexamic acid are preferred over desmopressin in many cases, with desmopressin reserved for select type 1 VWD contexts; multidisciplinary care and iron management are essential, and I must avoid overpromising desmopressin efficacy where it is unlikely to help [^115dRQLw] [^116RW6MW].

> Hold on, I should verify anticoagulation-related AUB. Women on anticoagulants, particularly DOACs, have higher rates of heavy menstrual bleeding, with rivaroxaban often worse than apixaban or dabigatran; management includes optimizing anticoagulant choice when feasible, using hormonal therapies or tranexamic acid, and coordinating with hematology, recognizing that dabigatran may be preferred in some menstruating patients due to relatively lower AUB rates observed in observational data [^116QcHsm].

> Let me reconsider evidence gaps so I don't overstate certainty. Randomized data directly comparing progestin-only versus combined regimens for anovulatory bleeding are sparse, and many recommendations rely on indirect evidence and expert consensus; similarly, comparative effectiveness data between LNG-IUS, ablation, and hysterectomy are growing but heterogeneous, reinforcing the need to align therapy with patient values and local expertise [^115p6g3S] [^111msc61].

> I should now synthesize a practical algorithm. Start with FIGO System 1 to characterize bleeding, apply PALM-COEIN to structure the differential, exclude pregnancy, and assess hemodynamic stability; in acute unstable bleeding, stabilize and use high-dose medical therapy or procedural control; in chronic stable bleeding, prioritize LNG-IUS or COCs, add tranexamic acid or NSAIDs as appropriate, escalate to ablation or hysterectomy based on failure, fertility goals, and preferences; throughout, screen for anemia, correct iron deficiency, and reassess periodically for new structural or systemic causes if bleeding persists [^112Rqtnw] [^11774Peq] [^113YF2MP].

> Key takeaway, and let me double-check that I'm not missing anything critical: modern AUB care hinges on standardized FIGO nomenclature, a structured PALM-COEIN differential, risk-stratified evaluation with judicious use of endometrial sampling, and a stepwise treatment ladder that prioritizes medical therapy while aligning invasive options with fertility goals and patient preferences; persistent bleeding despite appropriate therapy should trigger re-evaluation for missed structural or systemic etiologies rather than automatic escalation [^113fHGnu] [^11774Peq] [^112Rqtnw].

---

Dysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB) is **abnormal uterine bleeding** [^113X7SoY] without structural or systemic disease, most often due to anovulation [^115EZtcu]. It is a **diagnosis of exclusion** [^115B7EjJ] that requires ruling out pregnancy, structural lesions, coagulopathies, and endocrine or iatrogenic causes [^11774Peq]. Management is **medical first-line** [^11774Peq], with combined oral contraceptives or progestins for cycle control [^113YF2MP]; the levonorgestrel intrauterine system is highly effective for heavy menstrual bleeding [^113YF2MP]. Reserve surgery for refractory cases or when malignancy is suspected [^11774Peq], and address anemia and patient preferences throughout care [^116275Nz].

---

## Definition and classification

DUB is defined as **abnormal uterine bleeding** [^113X7SoY] without identifiable structural or systemic disease [^115EZtcu]. The FIGO PALM-COEIN system classifies AUB into structural (PALM) and non-structural (COEIN) causes; DUB falls under COEIN, particularly ovulatory dysfunction (AUB-O) and endometrial causes (AUB-E) [^113fHGnu] [^111FKHQz].

---

## Etiology and pathophysiology

DUB is **primarily associated with anovulation** [^115EZtcu], leading to unopposed estrogen stimulation of the endometrium, causing irregular shedding and unpredictable bleeding [^115EZtcu]. Common causes include:

- **Puberty and perimenopause**: Hormonal fluctuations causing anovulatory cycles [^115EZtcu].
- **Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)**: Chronic anovulation with unopposed estrogen [^117PA1a1].
- **Thyroid dysfunction**: Hypo- or hyperthyroidism disrupting menstrual regulation [^117PA1a1].
- **Stress, weight changes, and exercise**: Altered hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis function [^notfound].

---

## Clinical presentation

DUB typically presents with **irregular menstrual cycles**, unpredictable bleeding, and variable flow volume [^115p6g3S]. Heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) is common and may lead to anemia, fatigue, and impaired quality of life [^116iWzwU].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

DUB is a **diagnosis of exclusion** [^115B7EjJ]; the evaluation includes:

- **History and physical examination**: Detailed menstrual history, assessment of hemodynamic stability, and pelvic examination [^11774Peq].
- **Laboratory tests**: Pregnancy test, complete blood count, thyroid function tests, prolactin levels, and coagulation studies if indicated [^11774Peq].
- **Imaging**: Transvaginal ultrasound to exclude structural lesions (polyps, fibroids) [^11774Peq].
- **Endometrial sampling**: Indicated in women ≥ 45 years, younger women with risk factors (obesity, PCOS), or persistent bleeding despite medical therapy [^11774Peq] [^113KNAgg].

---

## Management strategies

Medical management is **first-line** [^11774Peq]; surgery is reserved for refractory cases or when malignancy is suspected:

| **Medical therapy** | **Surgical therapy** |
|-|-|
| Combined oral contraceptives (COCs) | Endometrial ablation |
| Progestins (oral, injectable, intrauterine) | Hysterectomy |
| Levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) | Myomectomy (if fibroids present) |
| Tranexamic acid (antifibrinolytic) | Uterine artery embolization (UAE) |
| Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) | Polypectomy (if polyps present) |

---

Combined oral contraceptives regulate cycles and reduce bleeding [^113YF2MP]; progestins stabilize the endometrium and induce regular shedding; the LNG-IUS is highly effective for HMB, achieving **71–95% reduction** in menstrual blood loss [^113YF2MP]. Tranexamic acid and NSAIDs reduce bleeding by inhibiting fibrinolysis and prostaglandin synthesis, respectively [^113YF2MP].

---

## Complications

Untreated DUB can lead to **anemia** (iron deficiency anemia from chronic blood loss), endometrial hyperplasia, and increased risk of endometrial cancer due to chronic unopposed estrogen exposure [^117PA1a1]. Psychological distress and impaired quality of life are also common [^112Rqtnw].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis is **generally favorable** with appropriate medical management [^113YF2MP]. Most patients experience significant improvement in symptoms and quality of life. Persistent or refractory bleeding warrants re-evaluation for underlying structural or systemic causes [^11774Peq].

---

## Patient education and counseling

Patient education is essential, covering the nature of DUB, treatment options, and potential side effects. Counseling should emphasize adherence to therapy, recognition of warning signs (e.g. excessive bleeding, anemia), and the importance of regular follow-up [^116Kc3vU].

---

DUB is abnormal uterine bleeding without structural or systemic disease, most often due to anovulation [^115EZtcu]. Management is **medical first-line** [^116RUHof], with surgery reserved for refractory cases or suspected malignancy. Prognosis is favorable with appropriate treatment, but persistent bleeding requires re-evaluation [^11774Peq].

### Progestogens versus oestrogens and progestogens for irregular uterine bleeding associated with anovulation [^113X7SoY]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Dysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB) is excessively heavy, prolonged or frequent bleeding of uterine origin which is not due to pregnancy or to recognisable pelvic or systemic disease. Anovulation may be inferred from a number of observations but, in the normal clinical situation, anovulation is often assumed when a woman presents with heavy, prolonged or frequent bleeding, particularly in those who are at the extremes of reproductive life and in women known to have polycystic ovarian syndrome. Menstrual bleeding that is irregular or excessive is poorly tolerated by the majority of women. Changes in the length of the menstrual cycle generally imply disturbances of the hypothalamo-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis. In anovulatory DUB with acyclic (irregular) oestrogen production there will be no progesterone withdrawal from oestrogen primed endometrium and so cycles are irregular. Prolonged oestrogen stimulation may cause a build up of endometrium with erratic bleeding as it breaks down and is expelled. This is the rationale for using cyclical progestogens during the second half of the menstrual cycle, in order to provoke a regular withdrawal bleed. Continuous progestogen is intended to induce endometrial atrophy and hence to prevent oestrogen-stimulated endometrial proliferation. Progestogens, and oestrogens and progestogens in combination are already widely used in the management of irregular or excessive bleeding due to DUB but the regime, dose and type of progestogen used varies widely, with little consensus about the optimum treatment approach.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness and acceptability of progestogens alone and oestrogens and progestogens in combination in the management of irregular bleeding associated with anovulation.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Trials Register (searched 4 May 2007), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2007, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1966 to May 2007), EMBASE (1985 to May 2007), CINAHL (1982 to May 2007), Biological Abstracts (1969 to May 2007), Current Contents (1980 to 2007) and reference lists of articles.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials of progestogens (via any route) alone or in combination with oestrogens in the treatment of irregular bleeding associated with anovulation.

Data Collection and Analysis

Study quality assessment and data extraction were carried out independently by two review authors. Both authors were experts in the content matter.

Main Results

No randomised trials were identified which compared progestogens with oestrogens and progestogens or with placebo in the management of irregular bleeding associated with anovulation. Only one small, non-randomised study compared two progestogen regimes in the management of heavy and irregular bleeding in women with confirmed anovulation. One randomised study compared the effects of two progestogens on endometrial histology in women with a variety of menstrual symptoms, half of whom had cystic glandular hyperplasia.

Authors' Conclusions

There is a paucity of randomised studies relating to the use of progestogens and of oestrogens and progestogens in combination in the treatment of irregular bleeding associated with anovulation. Further research is needed to establish the role of these treatments in the management of this common gynaecological problem.

### Abnormal uterine bleeding in adolescents [^115DMgHx]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) is a common diagnosis in the adolescent female population. In recent years, changes have been made to standardize nomenclature, evaluation and management of AUB in adolescents. The terms "abnormal uterine bleeding" and "heavy menstrual bleeding" have replaced terms including "dysfunctional uterine bleeding", "menorrhagia", "metrorrhagia", and "menometrorrhagia". Due to a high prevalence of these diagnoses in this population and resulting effects on quality of life, clinicians should understand and practice current evidence-based care, yet variability continues to exist. Evaluation should be focused on common etiologies of AUB in adolescents, namely non-structural causes, rather than those etiologies more common in adult females. The aim of this article is to review the existing definition, etiologies, pathophysiology, evaluation and management of AUB in adolescent females, with an emphasis on current universally accepted nomenclature and guidelines for use in clinical care.

### Abnormal uterine bleeding [^115B7EjJ]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Abnormal uterine bleeding is a common presenting symptom in the family practice setting. In women of childbearing age, a methodical history, physical examination, and laboratory evaluation may enable the physician to rule out causes such as pregnancy and pregnancy-related disorders, medications, iatrogenic causes, systemic conditions, and obvious genital tract pathology. Dysfunctional uterine bleeding (anovulatory or ovulatory) is diagnosed by exclusion of these causes. In women of childbearing age who are at high risk for endometrial cancer, the initial evaluation includes endometrial biopsy; saline-infusion sonohysterography or diagnostic hysteroscopy is performed if initial studies are inconclusive or the bleeding continues. Women of childbearing age who are at low risk for endometrial cancer may be assessed initially by transvaginal ultrasonography. Postmenopausal women with abnormal uterine bleeding should be offered dilatation and curettage; if they are poor candidates for general anesthesia or decline dilatation and curettage, they may be offered transvaginal ultrasonography or saline-infusion sonohysterography with directed endometrial biopsy. Medical management of anovulatory dysfunctional uterine bleeding may include oral contraceptive pills or cyclic progestins. Menorrhagia is managed most effectively with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or the levonorgestrel intrauterine contraceptive device. Surgical management may include hysterectomy or less invasive, uterus-sparing procedures.

### Abnormal uterine bleeding: current classification and clinical management [^113fHGnu]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Abnormal uterine bleeding is now classified and categorized according to the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics classification system: PALM-COEIN. This applies to nongravid women during their reproductive years and allows more clear designation of causes, thus aiding clinical care and future research.

### Clinical practice guideline for abnormal uterine bleeding: hysterectomy versus alternative therapy [^116Kc3vU]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2011). Low credibility.

Study Objective

To develop recommendations in selecting treatments for abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB).

Design

Clinical practice guidelines.

Setting

Randomized clinical trials compared bleeding, quality of life, pain, sexual health, satisfaction, the need for subsequent surgery, and adverse events between hysterectomy and less-invasive treatment options.

Patients

Women with AUB, predominantly from ovulatory disorders and endometrial causes.

Interventions

On the basis of findings from a systematic review, clinical practice guidelines were developed. Rating the quality of evidence and the strength of recommendations followed the Grades for Recommendation Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system.

Measurements and Main Results

This paper identified few high-quality studies that directly compared uterus-preserving treatments (endometrial ablation, levonorgestrel intrauterine system and systemically administered medications) with hysterectomy. The evidence from these randomized clinical trials demonstrated that there are trade-offs between hysterectomy and uterus-preserving treatments in terms of efficacy and adverse events.

Conclusion

Selecting an appropriate treatment for AUB requires identifying a woman's most burdensome symptoms and incorporating her values and preferences when weighing the relative benefits and harms of hysterectomy versus other treatment options.

### Management of abnormal uterine bleeding with emphasis on alternatives to hysterectomy [^112J8fSX]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) is a common problem that negatively impacts a woman's health-related quality of life and activity. Initial medical treatment includes hormonal and nonhormonal medications. If bleeding persists and no structural abnormalities are present, a repeat trial of medical therapy, a levonorgestrel intrauterine system, or an endometrial ablation can be used dependent on future fertility wishes. The levonorgestrel intrauterine system and endometrial ablation are effective, less invasive, and safe alternatives to a hysterectomy in women with AUB. A hysterectomy is the definitive treatment of AUB irrespective of the suspected cause when alternative treatments fail. Future studies should focus on detection of predictors for treatment outcomes.

### Hysterectomy compared with endometrial ablation for dysfunctional uterine bleeding: a randomized controlled trial [^114fZf2y]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the effectiveness of hysterectomy and endometrial ablation in women with dysfunctional uterine bleeding.

Methods

The Surgical Treatments Outcomes Project for Dysfunctional Uterine Bleeding was a multicenter, randomized controlled trial. Eligible women were premenopausal with dysfunctional uterine bleeding and aged 18 years or older. Primary outcomes were problems that led the woman to seek care solved, bleeding, pain, and fatigue at 12 months. Additional outcomes included quality of life, adverse events, reoperation, and others at 24 months and up to 5 years.

Results

We randomly assigned 237 women between January 1998 and June 2001. Follow-up ended in June 2003. We completed 24 months of follow-up on 114 of 123 women assigned to endometrial ablation and 111 of 114 assigned to hysterectomy. Approximately 85% of women were aged younger than 45 years; 76.4% classified themselves as white, 18.6% as African American, less than 1% as Asian, 4.6% as American Indian, and 8.4% as Hispanic (classification within more than one category possible). Both endometrial ablation and hysterectomy were effective at 24 months in solving the problem that led women to seek care (84.9% compared with 94.4%), and in relieving bleeding, pain, fatigue, and other symptoms, although hysterectomy was more effective for bleeding. By 48 months, 32 of the 110 women initially receiving endometrial ablation required reoperation. Adverse events were more frequent with hysterectomy.

Conclusion

Both endometrial ablation and hysterectomy are effective treatments in women with dysfunctional uterine bleeding. Hysterectomy (as the index surgery) was associated with more adverse events and a substantial number of patients receiving endometrial ablation had reoperation.

### Nonsurgical management of heavy menstrual bleeding: a systematic review [^113YF2MP]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the effectiveness of nonsurgical abnormal uterine bleeding treatments for bleeding control, quality of life (QOL), pain, sexual health, patient satisfaction, additional treatments needed, and adverse events.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, Cochrane databases, and Clinicaltrials.gov were searched from inception to May 2012. We included randomized controlled trials of nonsurgical treatments for abnormal uterine bleeding presumed secondary to endometrial dysfunction and abnormal uterine bleeding presumed secondary to ovulatory dysfunction. Interventions included the levonorgestrel intrauterine system, combined oral contraceptive pills (OCPs), progestins, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and antifibrinolytics. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists, danazol, and placebo were allowed as comparators.

Methods Of Study Selection

Two reviewers independently screened 5,848 citations and extracted eligible trials. Studies were assessed for quality and strength of evidence.

Tabulation, Integration, and Results

Twenty-six articles met inclusion criteria. For reduction of menstrual bleeding in women with abnormal uterine bleeding presumed secondary to endometrial dysfunction, the levonorgestrel intrauterine system (71–95% reduction), combined OCPs (35–69% reduction), extended cycle oral progestins (87% reduction), tranexamic acid (26–54% reduction), and NSAIDs (10–52% reduction) were all effective treatments. The levonorgestrel intrauterine system, combined OCPs, and antifibrinolytics were all superior to luteal-phase progestins (20% increase in bleeding to 67% reduction). The levonorgestrel intrauterine system was superior to combined OCPs and NSAIDs. Antifibrinolytics were superior to NSAIDs for menstrual bleeding reduction. Data were limited on other important outcomes such as QOL for women with abnormal uterine bleeding presumed secondary to endometrial dysfunction and for all outcomes for women with abnormal uterine bleeding presumed secondary to ovulatory dysfunction.

Conclusion

For the reduction in mean blood loss in women with heavy menstrual bleeding presumed secondary to abnormal uterine bleeding presumed secondary to endometrial dysfunction, we recommend the use of the levonorgestrel intrauterine system over OCPs, luteal-phase progestins, and NSAIDs. For other outcomes (QOL, pain, sexual health, patient satisfaction, additional treatments needed, and adverse events) and for treatment of abnormal uterine bleeding presumed secondary to ovulatory dysfunction, we were unable to make recommendations based on the limited available data.

### Management of pre-, peri-, and post-menopausal abnormal uterine bleeding: when to perform endometrial sampling? [^113KNAgg]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) is defined as abnormal volume, duration, or frequency of menstrual period and is a common symptom in women of all ages (premenopausal, perimenopausal, and postmenopausal). The acronym PALM-COEIN, introduced by the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO), facilitates the evaluation and differential diagnosis of AUB, mostly in premenopausal women with AUB. Endometrial evaluation (including ultrasound or hysteroscopic imaging and tissue sampling) for subtle pathology is proposed in patients who are at high risk for endometrial cancer and in patients at low risk who present with AUB and who present poor correspondence in medical treatment. Many new diagnostic modalities are available in clinicians in order to help the assessment of women presenting with abnormalities in their menstrual pattern. The present study reviews the optimal management of women presenting with AUB, taking into consideration the actual need for invasive management in these women, who of them require it, and who can be diagnosed without histological verification. The importance of endometrial tissue sampling in women who present with AUB as well as the best timing for a clinician to conduct a biopsy are two axons analyzed below, according to the latest worldwide guidelines and major publications about this subject.

### Progestogens with or without oestrogen for irregular uterine bleeding associated with anovulation [^115p6g3S]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Irregular menstrual bleeding may arise due to exogenous sex steroids, lesions of the genital tract or be associated with anovulation. Irregular bleeding due to oligo/anovulation (previously called dysfunctional uterine bleeding or DUB) is more common at the extremes of reproductive life, and in women with ovulatory disorders such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). In anovulatory cycles there may be prolonged oestrogen stimulation of the endometrium without progesterone withdrawal and so cycles are irregular and bleeding may be heavy. This is the rationale for using cyclical progestogens during the second half of the menstrual cycle, in order to provoke a regular withdrawal bleed. Continuous progestogen is intended to induce endometrial atrophy and hence to prevent oestrogen-stimulated endometrial proliferation. Progestogens, and oestrogens and progestogens in combination, are widely used in the management of irregular menstrual bleeding, but the regime, dose and type of progestogen used vary widely, with little consensus about the optimum treatment approach.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness and acceptability of progestogens alone or in combination with oestrogens in the regulation of irregular menstrual bleeding associated with oligo/anovulation.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases in February 2012: Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Trials Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and reference lists of articles.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials of progestogens (via any route) alone or in combination with oestrogens in the treatment of irregular menstrual bleeding associated with oligo/anovulation.

Data Collection and Analysis

Study quality assessment and data extraction were carried out independently by two review authors. All authors were experts in the content of this review.

Main Results

No randomised trials were identified that compared progestogens with oestrogens and progestogens or with placebo in the management of irregular bleeding associated with oligo/anovulation.

Authors' Conclusions

There is a paucity of randomised studies relating to the use of progestogens and of oestrogens and progestogens in combination in the treatment of irregular menstrual bleeding associated with anovulation. There is no consensus about which regimens are most effective. Further research is needed to establish the role of these hormonal treatments in the management of this common gynaecological problem.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 557: management of acute abnormal uterine bleeding in nonpregnant reproductive-aged women [^117NxJgW]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2013). Low credibility.

Initial evaluation of the patient with acute abnormal uterine bleeding should include a prompt assessment for signs of hypovolemia and potential hemodynamic instability. After initial assessment and stabilization, the etiologies of acute abnormal uterine bleeding should be classified using the PALM-COEIN system. Medical management should be the initial treatment for most patients, if clinically appropriate. Options include intravenous conjugated equine estrogen, multi-dose regimens of combined oral contraceptives or oral progestins, and tranexamic acid. Decisions should be based on the patient's medical history and contraindications to therapies. Surgical management should be considered for patients who are not clinically stable, are not suitable for medical management, or have failed to respond appropriately to medical management. The choice of surgical management should be based on the patient's underlying medical conditions, underlying pathology, and desire for future fertility. Once the acute bleeding episode has been controlled, transitioning the patient to long-term maintenance therapy is recommended.

### Acupuncture treatment for dysfunctional uterine bleeding in an adolescent [^116EZKF4]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

Dysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB) is common among adolescent girls. Approximately 9%–30% of reproductive-aged women have menstrual irregularities requiring medical attention. Treatment options are different medical regimens for a few months or longer. Treatment failure, non-compliance and side effects are all concerns. Metformin and combined oral contraceptives for reduction of irregular bleeding had low or moderate strength of evidence for effectiveness. Traditional Chinese acupuncture may provide benefit as an adjunctive or alternative treatment in cases where medical therapies have not been successful.

### Society of Family Planning clinical recommendations: management of individuals with bleeding or thrombotic disorders undergoing abortion [^114VgUF3]. Contraception (2021). High credibility.

Bleeding disorders — clinical considerations note that individuals with bleeding disorders may be at greater risk for increased blood loss, hemorrhage, and possible complications during medication abortion and procedural abortion; the most common inherited bleeding disorder is von Willebrand disease (VWD), caused by decreased levels of von Willebrand factor or, more rarely, a dysfunctional protein; the prevalence of symptomatic VWD is estimated to be 0.01%; and increased estrogen during pregnancy leads to progressively higher von Willebrand factor levels over the second and third trimesters, which mitigates to some extent bleeding risk for women with symptomatic VWD.

### The FIGO systems for nomenclature and classification of causes of abnormal uterine bleeding in the reproductive years: who needs them? [^115P618Q]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2012). Low credibility.

In November 2010, the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics formally accepted a new classification system for causes of abnormal uterine bleeding in the reproductive years. The system, based on the acronym PALM-COEIN (polyps, adenomyosis, leiomyoma, malignancy and hyperplasia-coagulopathy, ovulatory disorders, endometrial causes, iatrogenic, not classified) was developed in response to concerns about the design and interpretation of basic science and clinical investigation that relates to the problem of abnormal uterine bleeding. A system of nomenclature for the description of normal uterine bleeding and the various symptoms that comprise abnormal bleeding has also been included. This article describes the rationale, the structured methods that involved stakeholders worldwide, and the suggested use of the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics system for research, education, and clinical care. Investigators in the field are encouraged to use the system in the design of their abnormal uterine bleeding-related research because it is an approach that should improve our understanding and management of this often perplexing clinical condition.

Figure 4
The modern effect of menstruation

Previously, women experienced menstruation approximately 40 times in their lifetime, owing to pregnancy and lactational amenorrhea. Women may now expect to have more than 400 episodes of menstruation, mainly as a result of fertility management. Therefore, AUB is increasingly common. Women may experience significant anemia resulting in a poor physical quality of life. A negative financial effect occurs because of the cost of managing their blood loss and an inability to work outside the home. These costs, alongside a loss of caring ability, will have a negative effect on the wider family. The cost to society through loss of work days and healthcare costs is significant.

II. A classification system for abnormal uterine bleeding

To provide diagnostic precision and specific treatment of AUB, classification of causes of uterine bleeding is crucial. The FIGO Menstrual Disorders Committee has led on the classification systems for causes of chronic AUB in the reproductive years. As already mentioned, there are 2 systems: the first system focuses on terminology with an encouragement for the removal of ill-defined terminologies such as "menorrhagia" and "dysfunctional uterine bleeding", and the second system focuses on the underlying causes of AUB, using the acronym PALM-COEIN, for structural and nonstructural causes, respectively (Figure 5). It is hoped that these 2 FIGO systems will be used globally to improve the management of women with AUB.

### Uterine artery embolisation for acute dysfunctional uterine bleeding with failed medical therapy: a novel approach to management [^113mwtME]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

A 35-year-old woman with a history of three previous caesarean sections was admitted with acute dysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB) complicated by anaemia; she had a haemoglobin level of 5.3g/dL, requiring multiple blood transfusions. Investigations performed excluded pelvic pathology and haematological causes for her acute DUB. Despite the use of various pharmacological agents, her bleeding persisted and she eventually underwent uterine artery embolisation (UAE) to arrest bleeding. She was well postprocedure and was discharged on combined oral contraceptives. However, she presented a year later with another episode of acute DUB that required a repeat UAE. This case report summarises the use of UAE in the management of acute DUB following failed medical therapy.

### Imaging of complications following gynecologic surgery [^112H6TNN]. Radiographics (2010). Low credibility.

Despite new nonsurgical treatment methods for gynecologic diseases (eg, endometrial radiofrequency ablation for dysfunctional uterine bleeding, uterine artery embolization for uterine fibroids), surgery continues to be the main treatment modality in this setting. New and improved surgical techniques include laparoscopic hysterectomy, which is performed much more frequently than abdominal hysterectomy because it offers the advantages of speedy postsurgical recovery and a short hospital stay. Nevertheless, a number of early and delayed complications continue to occur following gynecologic surgery. Radiologists with access to multiple imaging modalities play an important role in the diagnosis and management of these postsurgical complications and can assist the surgeon at this critical juncture. Improved computed tomographic and magnetic resonance imaging techniques have made imaging more reliable for early diagnosis. Familiarity with normal postsurgical anatomy, pitfalls in interpretation, and imaging-guided interventional procedures will facilitate the diagnosis and management of complications following gynecologic surgery.

### The medical management of abnormal uterine bleeding in reproductive-aged women [^116RUHof]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

In the treatment of women with abnormal uterine bleeding, once a thorough history, physical examination, and indicated imaging studies are performed and all significant structural causes are excluded, medical management is the first-line approach. Determining the acuity of the bleeding, the patient's medical history, assessing risk factors, and establishing a diagnosis will individualize their medical regimen. In acute abnormal uterine bleeding with a normal uterus, parenteral estrogen, a multidose combined oral contraceptive regimen, a multidose progestin-only regimen, and tranexamic acid are all viable options, given the appropriate clinical scenario. Heavy menstrual bleeding can be treated with a levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system, combined oral contraceptives, continuous oral progestins, and tranexamic acid with high efficacy. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs may be utilized with hormonal methods and tranexamic acid to decrease menstrual bleeding. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists are indicated in patients with leiomyoma and abnormal uterine bleeding in preparation for surgical interventions. In women with inherited bleeding disorders all hormonal methods as well as tranexamic acid can be used to treat abnormal uterine bleeding. Women on anticoagulation therapy should consider using progestin-only methods as well as a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist to treat their heavy menstrual bleeding. Given these myriad options for medical treatment of abnormal uterine bleeding, many patients may avoid surgical intervention.

### Evaluation and management of abnormal uterine bleeding in premenopausal women [^117PA1a1]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Up to 14 percent of women experience irregular or excessively heavy menstrual bleeding. This abnormal uterine bleeding generally can be divided into anovulatory and ovulatory patterns. Chronic anovulation can lead to irregular bleeding, prolonged unopposed estrogen stimulation of the endometrium, and increased risk of endometrial cancer. Causes include polycystic ovary syndrome, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, thyroid dysfunction, hyperprolactinemia, and use of antipsychotics or antiepileptics. Women 35 years or older with recurrent anovulation, women younger than 35 years with risk factors for endometrial cancer, and women with excessive bleeding unresponsive to medical therapy should undergo endometrial biopsy. Treatment with combination oral contraceptives or progestins may regulate menstrual cycles. Histologic findings of hyperplasia without atypia may be treated with cyclic or continuous progestin. Women who have hyperplasia with atypia or adenocarcinoma should be referred to a gynecologist or gynecologic oncologist, respectively. Ovulatory abnormal uterine bleeding, or menorrhagia, may be caused by thyroid dysfunction, coagulation defects (most commonly von Willebrand disease), endometrial polyps, and submucosal fibroids. Transvaginal ultrasonography or saline infusion sonohysterography may be used to evaluate menorrhagia. The levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system is an effective treatment for menorrhagia. Oral progesterone for 21 days per month and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are also effective. Tranexamic acid is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of ovulatory bleeding, but is expensive. When clear structural causes are identified or medical management is ineffective, polypectomy, fibroidectomy, uterine artery embolization, and endometrial ablation may be considered. Hysterectomy is the most definitive treatment.

### Management of uterine bleeding during hematopoietic stem cell transplantation [^111CxgGi]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Hematopoietic stem cell transplant is an effective treatment strategy for a variety of hematologic disorders, but patients are at risk for dysfunctional coagulation and abnormal bleeding. Gynecologists are often consulted before transplant for management of abnormal uterine bleeding, which may be particularly challenging in this context.

Case

A premenopausal woman with MonoMAC (a rare adult-onset immunodeficiency syndrome characterized by monocytopenia and Mycobacterium avium complex infections resulting from mutations in GATA2, a crucial gene in early hematopoiesis) presented with pancytopenia, evolving leukemia, and recent strokes, necessitating anticoagulation. During preparation for hematopoietic stem cell transplant, she experienced prolonged menorrhagia requiring transfusions. Surgical therapy was contraindicated, and medical management was successful only when combined with balloon tamponade.

Conclusion

Balloon tamponade may be a potentially life-saving adjunct to medical therapy for control of uterine hemorrhage before hematopoietic stem cell transplant.

### The FIGO classification of causes of abnormal uterine bleeding in the reproductive years [^111FKHQz]. Fertility and Sterility (2011). Low credibility.

At this juncture, clinical management, education for medical providers, and the design and interpretation of clinical trials have been hampered by the absence of a consensus system for nomenclature for the description of symptoms as well as classification of causes or potential causes of abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB). To address this issue, the Fédération Internationale de Gynécologie et d'Obstétrique (FIGO) has designed the PALM-COEIN (Polyp, Adenomyosis, Leiomyoma, Malignancy and Hyperplasia, Coagulopathy, Ovulatory Disorders, Endometrial Disorders, Iatrogenic Causes, and Not Classified) classification system for causes of AUB in the reproductive years.

### Contemporary evaluation of women and girls with abnormal uterine bleeding: FIGO systems 1 and 2 [^112Rqtnw]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) is common, often debilitating, and may affect over 50% of reproductive-aged women and girls. Whereas AUB is a collection of symptoms that include intermenstrual bleeding and abnormalities in period duration, cycle length, and regularity, it is heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) that is most contributory to iron deficiency and related anemia. It is apparent that AUB, in general, and HMB, in particular, remain underrecognized and underreported. FIGO created two systems for assessing and classifying AUB. FIGO System 1 defines the bleeding pattern using four primary descriptors: frequency, duration, regularity, and flow volume. FIGO System 2 provides a structured classification system of possible causes of AUB, using the acronym PALM-COEIN. "PALM" refers to structural causes of AUB (Polyp, Adenomyosis, Leiomyoma, Malignancy), and "COEI" refers to nonstructural causes (Coagulopathy, Ovulatory dysfunction, Endometrial, and Iatrogenic). The "N" is reserved for those entities that are currently not otherwise classified. Using FIGO System 1 as a gateway to FIGO System 2 streamlines the investigation of reproductive-aged women and girls with AUB. Understanding the pathogenesis of the FIGO System 2 "PALM-COEIN" causes helps interpret investigations and the onward management of AUB. Numerous evidence gaps exist concerning AUB; however, if researchers and trialists universally adopt FIGO Systems 1 and 2 for the assessment and diagnosis of AUB, clear translatable research findings can be applied globally.

### Society of Family Planning clinical recommendation: management of hemorrhage at the time of abortion [^116pkpye]. Contraception (2024). High credibility.

Society of Family Planning clinical recommendation — management of hemorrhage at the time of abortion notes that hemorrhage after abortion is rare, occurring in fewer than 1% of abortions, and that although medication abortion is associated with more bleeding than procedural abortion, overall bleeding for the two methods is minimal and not clinically different. The Society of Family Planning recommends preoperative identification of individuals at high risk of hemorrhage as well as development of an organized approach to treatment, and specifically states that individuals with a uterine scar and complete placenta previa seeking abortion at gestations after the first trimester should be evaluated for placenta accreta spectrum. For those at high risk of hemorrhage, referral to a higher-acuity center should be considered. An algorithm for treating postabortion hemorrhage is provided as follows: (1) assessment and examination, (2) uterine massage and medical therapy, (3) resuscitative measures with laboratory evaluation and possible reaspiration or balloon tamponade, and (4) interventions such as embolization and surgery. Evidence supports the use of oxytocin as prophylaxis for bleeding with dilation and evacuation; methylergonovine prophylaxis, however, is associated with more bleeding at the time of dilation and evacuation, and future research is needed on tranexamic acid as prophylaxis and treatment and misoprostol as prophylaxis.

### Heavy menstrual bleeding: an update on management [^111bMQhf]. Thrombosis Research (2017). Low credibility.

Heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) is defined as excessive menstrual blood loss (MBL) > 80 mL per cycle, that interferes with a woman's physical, emotional, social wellbeing and quality of life. Aetiology is due to underlying uterine pathologies, coagulopathy, ovulation dysfunction, or iatrogenic. Up to 20% of women with HMB will have an underlying inherited bleeding disorder (IBD). Assessment of HMB should entail a menstrual and gynaecological history and a bleeding score to distinguish those women who require additional haematological investigations. A pelvic examination and ultrasound scan help to rule out presence of any underlying pathology. Management depends on the underlying cause and the woman's preference and her fertility wishes. Medical therapies include hormonal treatments; levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) and combined hormonal contraceptives are most commonly used. Ulipristal acetate is an approved preoperative treatment for uterine fibroids, and has demonstrated efficacy in reducing MBL. Haemostatic therapies include tranexamic acid and DDAVP (1-deamino-8-D-arginine). DDAVP is used for HMB associated with certain IBDs. These therapies can be used in isolation or in combination with hormonal treatments. HMB associated with certain severe IBDs may require factor concentrate administration during menses to alleviate symptoms. Endometrial ablation is a minor surgical procedure that is associated with low operative morbidity and can be performed as an outpatient. Hysterectomy remains the definitive treatment of choice when medical therapies have failed and endometrial ablation is not suitable.

Abstract

Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) is common, often debilitating, and may affect over 50% of reproductive‐aged women and girls. Whereas AUB is a collection of symptoms that include intermenstrual bleeding and abnormalities in period duration, cycle length, and regularity, it is heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) that is most contributory to iron deficiency and related anemia. It is apparent that AUB, in general, and HMB, in particular, remain underrecognized and underreported. FIGO created two systems for assessing and classifying AUB. FIGO System 1 defines the bleeding pattern using four primary descriptors: frequency, duration, regularity, and flow volume. FIGO System 2 provides a structured classification system of possible causes of AUB, using the acronym PALM‐COEIN. "PALM" refers to structural causes of AUB (Polyp, Adenomyosis, Leiomyoma, Malignancy), and "COEI" refers to nonstructural causes (Coagulopathy, Ovulatory dysfunction, Endometrial, and Iatrogenic).

### A systematic review comparing hysterectomy with less-invasive treatments for abnormal uterine bleeding [^111msc61]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2011). Low credibility.

Study Objective

To compare hysterectomy with less-invasive alternatives for abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) in 7 clinically important domains.

Design

Systematic review.

Setting

Randomized clinical trials comparing bleeding, quality of life, pain, sexual health, satisfaction, need for subsequent surgery, and adverse events between hysterectomy and less-invasive treatment options.

Patients

Women with AUB, predominantly from ovulatory disorders and endometrial causes.

Interventions

Systematic review of the literature (from inception to January 2011) comparing hysterectomy with alternatives for AUB treatment. Eligible trials were extracted into standardized forms. Trials were graded with a predefined 3-level rating, and the strengths of evidence for each outcome were evaluated with the Grades for Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation system.

Measurements and Main Results

Nine randomized clinical trials (18 articles) were eligible. Endometrial ablation, levonorgestrel intrauterine system, and medications were associated with lower risk of adverse events but higher risk of additional treatments than hysterectomy. Compared to ablation, hysterectomy had superior long-term pain and bleeding control. Compared with the levonorgestrel intrauterine system, hysterectomy had superior control of bleeding. No other differences between treatments were found.

Conclusion

Less-invasive treatment options for AUB result in improvement in quality of life but carry significant risk of retreatment caused by unsatisfactory results. Although hysterectomy is the most effective treatment for AUB, it carries the highest risk for adverse events.

4 SYSTEM 1

4.1 Normal and abnormal uterine bleeding definitions and terminology

FIGO System 1 was developed to formalize the nomenclature and definitions of normal and abnormal menstrual bleeding, allowing clinicians, investigators, and patients to align on the description of the bleeding patterns of those complaining of AUB (Figure 1). Each element is considered in the context of a structured history and defines normal and, therefore, abnormal features generally based on the fifth to 95th percentiles from large‐scale clinical studies. System 1 was the product of a rigorous Delphi process that was used to develop simple and translatable definitions while identifying and removing the need for obsolete terminologies such as menorrhagia, menometrorrhagia, and dysfunctional uterine bleeding.

FIGURE 1
FIGO Abnormal Uterine Bleeding (AUB) System 1, defining the nomenclature and definition of AUB (30). *The normal range is age dependent, with shortest to longest days for 18–25 years at ≤ 9 days, 26–41 years at ≤ 7 days, and 42–45 years at ≤ 9 days.

As seen in Figure 1, application of FIGO System 1 in a clinical scenario requires a structured history that allows a description of the four parameters of frequency, duration, regularity, and subjective flow volume, as well as the presence or absence of IMB and unscheduled bleeding for those on progestin‐based gonadal steroid formulations. Of course, cyclical administration of estrogen and progestin‐containing agents, typically for contraception, is expected to result in cyclical withdrawal bleeding from the endometrium. All the metrics are based on the previous 6 months, provided there has been no pregnancy or puerperium.

Frequency

The number of days in an average menstrual cycle from the first day of bleeding in one cycle to the first day of the next cycle. The normal length of a menstrual cycle ranges from 24 to 38 days, whereas abnormal frequency of menstruation is less than 24 days (frequent menses) or more than 38 days (infrequent menses). The absence of menstrual bleeding, without an iatrogenic cause, should be characterized as amenorrhea, as this too is abnormal.

Duration

The number of consecutive bleeding days in each cycle, where the count begins with the onset of bleeding and ends on the last day of blood flow, including the light bleeding, often called spotting. It is normal for women to bleed for up to eight consecutive days, whereas longer than this would be considered prolonged and abnormal.

### Review of the confusion in current and historical terminology and definitions for disturbances of menstrual bleeding [^116bRtHM]. Fertility and Sterility (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

There has been increasing recent recognition of the worldwide confusion in the terminology and definitions for abnormalities of menstrual and uterine bleeding. The present review was undertaken to objectively explore some of the origins and current uses of terms for symptoms, signs, and causes of abnormal uterine bleeding and to demonstrate the international lack of uniformity.

Design

A detailed, but not systematic, search of the huge current and historical literature across the range of menstrual terminology, definitions, and some causes, with an emphasis on "menorrhagia" and "dysfunctional uterine bleeding".

Setting

An international collaboration to study ways of reaching worldwide agreement on descriptive terms and definitions for abnormal bleeding.

Result(S)

A large number of synonyms and overlapping terms for heavy menstrual bleeding have been identified, as well as smaller numbers of terms for other symptoms and causes of abnormal uterine bleeding. The origins and meanings of several of these terms have been explored in detail and wide variations in meaning demonstrated.

Conclusion(S)

There is great confusion in the way these terminologies are used and there is an urgent need for international agreement on consistent use of terms and definitions for symptoms, signs, and causes of abnormal uterine bleeding.

Perioperative considerations in individuals with a bleeding disorder/on anticoagulation — risk factors and hemoglobin thresholds: When approaching surgical planning it is important to consider factors that potentially increase the risk of bleeding, including higher gestational age (second trimester vs. first trimester), multiple pregnancy, prior cesarean section or uterine surgery, abnormal placentation, baseline anemia, and if anticoagulated, whether the anticoagulation dosing is therapeutic or prophylactic; hemoglobin thresholds vary by setting, but procedural abortion in an outpatient setting should generally not be attempted in individuals with a hemoglobin of less than 8 g/dL and is not recommended in a hospital-based setting without availability of pre-operative or intraoperative transfusion in a patient with a hemoglobin of less than 7 g/dL.

### Special considerations for women of reproductive age on anticoagulation [^112LLoQR]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

METHODS

To understand rates of abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) experienced by women of reproductive age on anticoagulation, we searched PubMed and EMBASE using the following key terms: "reproductive health" OR "childbearing age" OR "reproductive age" OR "menstrual cycle" OR menstruat* OR menstrual* OR "heavy menstrual bleeding" OR "Menstruation Disturbances" OR "uterine hemorrhage" OR "vaginal bleeding" OR menorrhagia OR "breakthrough bleeding" OR "spotting" OR "dysfunctional uterine bleeding" OR "ovarian cysts" OR "ovarian cyst" AND (Anticoagulants OR anticoagulant* OR anticoagulat*). We selected articles that included observational and comparative studies, clinical trials, meta-analyses, reviews, and practice guidelines. With the goal of identifying current literature, search dates were restricted to the prior decade (2011–2021), which aligns with the initial US Food and Drug Administration approval of the direct-acting oral anticoagulants. From 204 records screened, 20 articles were included in this review (see Supplementary Material).

We also draw on the IBM Micromedex and LactMed databases for clinical data regarding drug safety and adverse events of six commonly used anticoagulants: apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban, dabigatran, enoxaparin, and warfarin. We will refer to both the anti-Xa inhibitors (i.e. apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban) and direct thrombin inhibitors (i.e. dabigatran) as direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs). By summarizing key information from these resources and select society guidelines, we have created a practical reference to guide clinical discussions with women of reproductive age regarding risks and benefits of anticoagulation.

### Uterine fibroids: diagnosis and treatment [^1133dkdo]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Uterine fibroids are common benign neoplasms, with a higher prevalence in older women and in those of African descent. Many are discovered incidentally on clinical examination or imaging in asymptomatic women. Fibroids can cause abnormal uterine bleeding, pelvic pressure, bowel dysfunction, urinary frequency and urgency, urinary retention, low back pain, constipation, and dyspareunia. Ultrasonography is the preferred initial imaging modality. Expectant management is recommended for asymptomatic patients because most fibroids decrease in size during menopause. Management should be tailored to the size and location of fibroids; the patient's age, symptoms, desire to maintain fertility, and access to treatment; and the experience of the physician. Medical therapy to reduce heavy menstrual bleeding includes hormonal contraceptives, tranexamic acid, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists or selective progesterone receptor modulators are an option for patients who need symptom relief preoperatively or who are approaching menopause. Surgical treatment includes hysterectomy, myomectomy, uterine artery embolization, and magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound surgery.

### Abnormal uterine bleeding in premenopausal women [^11774Peq]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Abnormal uterine bleeding is a common symptom in women. The acronym PALM-COEIN facilitates classification, with PALM referring to structural etiologies (polyp, adenomyosis, leiomyoma, malignancy and hyperplasia), and COEIN referring to nonstructural etiologies (coagulopathy, ovulatory dysfunction, endometrial, iatrogenic, not otherwise classified). Evaluation involves a detailed history and pelvic examination, as well as laboratory testing that includes a pregnancy test and complete blood count. Endometrial sampling should be performed in patients 45 years and older, and in younger patients with a significant history of unopposed estrogen exposure. Transvaginal ultrasonography is the preferred imaging modality and is indicated if a structural etiology is suspected or if symptoms persist despite appropriate initial treatment. Medical and surgical treatment options are available. Emergency interventions for severe bleeding that causes hemodynamic instability include uterine tamponade, intravenous estrogen, dilation and curettage, and uterine artery embolization. To avoid surgical risks and preserve fertility, medical management is the preferred initial approach for hemodynamically stable patients. Patients with severe bleeding can be treated initially with oral estrogen, high-dose estrogen-progestin oral contraceptives, oral progestins, or intravenous tranexamic acid. The most effective long-term medical treatment for heavy menstrual bleeding is the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system. Other long-term medical treatment options include estrogen-progestin oral contraceptives, oral progestins, oral tranexamic acid, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and depot medroxyprogesterone. Hysterectomy is the definitive treatment. A lower-risk surgical option is endometrial ablation, which performs as well as the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system. Select patients with chronic uterine bleeding can be treated with myomectomy, polypectomy, or uterine artery embolization.

Case presentation

A 17-year-old girl with a body mass index of 23 and menarche at age 13 presented to her primary paediatrician's office for abnormal uterine bleeding since age 14. Her menstrual bleeding occurred 1–3 times per month, lasted 3–7 days and was painful. At age 15, she was referred to a gynaecologist for management because her irregularities worsened over time. A pelvic ultrasound, von Willebrand factor, complete blood count, platelet, anaemia profile, thyroid stimulating hormone, prothrombin time, partial thrombin time, factor 8, follicular stimulating hormone, luteinising hormone, oestradiol, 17-progesterone were all normal. Her Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) sulfate was mildly elevated 411 (normal 37–307). For the following 15 months, she was treated serially with Depo-Provera injections, OrthoEvra (ethinyl estradiol and norelgestromin) patches without improvement, and Estarylla contraceptive pill (CP) was started 1 month prior to presentation without improvement.

At the time of re-presentation to her paediatrician's office, despite being on a CP, she had four periods of bleeding in the month prior, with breaks lasting 1–4 days in between periods. She used up to 10 heavy pads per day, with frequent flooding. She reported pain of 8/10 with menstruation, large clots up to 2 cm in size, headache, dizziness and five episodes of syncope. At the time of presentation, she shared that despite good compliance with medication, she had noted no improvement in her menses and was becoming hopeless about ever improving her symptoms. She asked what else she could try to regulate her menstruation.

At this time, the author, who is the patient's paediatrician and is also fully trained and dual licensed in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), offered acupuncture treatment to manage her DUB with severe dysmenorrhoea. Based on TCM diagnostic criteria, the patient was diagnosed with abnormal uterine bleeding due to 'heat and phlegm with blood stasis'. The treatment principle is to 'clear heat, reduce phlegm', reduce stress, 'invigorate blood' and 'fill her conception (menstrual) channels'. The patient had not heard of acupuncture prior to the treatment, but after a trial of one needle, she was willing to commit to the treatment.

### A national survey of gynecologists on current practice patterns for management of abnormal uterine bleeding in south Korea [^114yMNSu]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate practice patterns of gynecologists in the management of abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) in South Korea.

Methods

Between February 24 and March 12, 2014, a cross-sectional survey was performed through face-to-face interviews with 100 gynecologists selected through quota sampling reflecting regions and hospital types. Through the use of a questionnaire, the level of awareness and practice patterns regarding diagnosis and management of AUB were evaluated.

Results

Among 100 respondents, 60 reported that they had not previously heard of the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) classification system. The standardization of AUB terminology was reported to be necessary or very necessary by 70 respondents. Pelvic ultrasonography would be used for diagnosis by 99 physicians. The most common first-line AUB treatment was combined oral contraceptives: 55 respondents would use them for heavy menstrual bleeding, 56 for intermenstrual bleeding, and 56 for polycystic ovary syndrome. Combined oral contraceptives were the preferred follow-up medication: 30 would use them for heavy menstrual bleeding, 24 for intermenstrual bleeding, and 52 for polycystic ovary syndrome.

Conclusion

Despite implementation of the FIGO AUB classification system and guidelines, awareness and use among gynecologists in South Korea remains low.

Patient(S)

Ninety women participated who had dysfunctional uterine bleeding.

Intervention(S)

Ninety-five percent of TCA was instilled into uterine cavity for endometrial ablation in women with dysfunctional uterine bleeding who want conservative treatment. Participants in group 1 received only TCA; participants in group 2 received a single dose of gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogue 1 month before the procedure.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

All participants underwent an evaluation that included cycle history, body mass index measurement, and transvaginal ultrasonography of pelvis, diagnostic hysteroscopy and endometrial biopsy.

Result(S)

At the end of 12 months of the treatment, amenorrhea rates in group 1 and group 2 were 26.7% vs. 31.1%, with pooled amenorrhea, hypomenorrhea, and eumenorrhea rates of 95.6% vs. 97.8%, respectively. There was no significant difference between the groups vis-a-vis postprocedure results. More than 90% of women who have this procedure are satisfied with the results. There were no observed negative effects or related complications with this treatment.

Conclusion(S)

An instillation of TCA into uterine cavity produces acceptable results and provides conservative management of DUB.

### Endometrial carcinoma after endometrial resection for dysfunctional uterine bleeding [^1132W4ys]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Endometrial destruction is an accepted conservative surgical approach for women with dysfunctional uterine bleeding. However, this procedure cannot guarantee complete removal of the entire endometrium. The possibility exists that endometrial carcinoma may develop even years after such procedure.

Case

We report on a case of endometrial carcinoma, which was diagnosed 3 years after hysteroscopic resection of the endometrium for dysfunctional uterine bleeding in a patient with no risk factors.

Conclusion

Endometrial carcinoma after hysteroscopic endometrial ablation is still a possibility even when strict selection criteria are applied.

### Treatment of dysfunctional uterine bleeding: patient preferences for endometrial ablation, a levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device, or hysterectomy [^115WLxBw]. Fertility and Sterility (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate patient preferences for endometrial ablation and a levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device (IUD) as alternatives to hysterectomy in the treatment of dysfunctional uterine bleeding.

Design

Comparative study based on structured interviews.

Setting

A large teaching hospital with 500 beds in the Netherlands.

Patient(S)

Ninety-six patients who were scheduled for endometrial ablation, 25 patients who were scheduled for hysterectomy, and 23 patients who were scheduled for a levonorgestrel-releasing IUD were interviewed. All of the women had dysfunctional uterine bleeding.

Intervention(S)

Patients were asked to state their most significant complaints and their reasons for choosing a particular treatment. Subsequently, the preference for endometrial ablation and a levonorgestrel-releasing IUD as alternatives to hysterectomy was assessed during a structured interview. Women were informed about the advantages and disadvantages of all three treatment options. Patients rated their preferences according to different hypothetical success rates. The success rates after endometrial ablation and levonorgestrel-releasing IUD were varied until patients found an acceptable treatment outcome.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Patient preference of endometrial ablation and the levonorgestrel-releasing IUD over hysterectomy.

Result(S)

The main reason for the treatment of choice differed between the three groups. Most of the patients in the hysterectomy group wanted a definite solution to their problems, whereas patients in the levonorgestrel-releasing IUD group and in the ablation group put greater emphasis on a minimally invasive intervention with or without a short hospital stay. In women undergoing ablation, 70% of the patients preferred this treatment and the levonorgestrel-releasing IUD to hysterectomy in cases in which the success rate of noninvasive treatment was presumed to be 50%. In women having a levonorgestrel-releasing IUD inserted, 95% of the patients preferred this approach over hysterectomy in cases in which the success rate of this device was presumed to be 50%, whereas 35% of patients preferred ablation over hysterectomy in cases in which the success rate of ablation was presumed to be 50%. In women undergoing hysterectomy, 30% would have opted for ablation and 45% would have opted for a levonorgestrel-releasing IUD in cases in which success rates were 50%. Of patients who opted for hysterectomy, however, 60% stated that they would have preferred a noninvasive treatment if the success rate of this type of treatment were > 80%.

Conclusion(S)

A majority of the patients who had dysfunctional uterine bleeding and who were scheduled for an endometrial ablation or a levonorgestrel-releasing IUD were inclined to take a risk of 50% likelihood of treatment failure to avoid a hysterectomy. As a consequence, research of treatment for dysfunctional uterine bleeding should focus on this 50% success level.

### Treatment of acute abnormal uterine bleeding in adolescents: what are providers doing in various specialties? [^112pr3xm]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Study Objective

The purpose of this study was to assess whether variability exists in the management of acute abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) in adolescents between pediatric Emergency Department (ED) physicians, pediatric gynecologists, and adolescent medicine specialists.

Design

Retrospective chart review.

Setting

Tertiary care medical center ED.

Participants, Interventions, and Main Outcome Measures

We included girls aged 9–22 years who presented from July 2008 to June 2014 with the complaint of acute AUB. Patients were identified using the International Classification of Diseases, ninth revision codes for heavy menstrual bleeding, AUB, and irregular menses. Exclusion criteria included pregnancy and current use of hormonal therapy. One hundred fifty patients were included.

Results

Among those evaluated, 61% (n = 92) were prescribed hormonal medication to stop their bleeding by providers from the ED, Adolescent Medicine, or Pediatric Gynecology. ED physicians prescribed mostly single-dose and multidose taper combined oral contraceptive pills (85%; n = 24), compared with Adolescent Medicine (54%, n = 7), and Gynecology (28%, n = 13). Pediatric gynecologists were more likely than ED physicians to treat patients with norethindrone acetate, either alone or in combination with a single dose combined oral contraceptive pill (61%, n = 33 vs 7%, n = 2; P < .001).

Conclusion

Variations in treatment strategies for adolescents who present with acute AUB exist among pediatric specialties, which reflects a lack of standardized care for adolescents. Prospective evaluation of the shortest interval to cessation of bleeding, side effects, and patient satisfaction are valuable next steps.

The panel "encourages the development of multidisciplinary clinics", and decisions on a levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system "should be made in the setting of shared decision making with multidisciplinary input". Patients with heavy menstrual bleeding "should be regularly assessed and treated for iron deficiency and/or anemia", and women with bleeding disorders "should undergo a standard gynecologic assessment… to rule out common pelvic pathologies, such as fibroids and polyps", with special consideration for those at higher risk including "women age > 35 years" and those with relevant comorbidities.

Patient's perspective

I started the acupuncture treatment for my problem with my doctor for a good period of time and my results were amazing! Now it all has been going really great. She helped me a lot, I appreciate her a lot for helping me after the main hospital couldn't. She could! I'm sure this treatment can help more girls with the same problem out there. Thank you doctor!

Learning points

Menstrual disorders such as dysfunctional uterine bleeding and dysmenorrhoea are relatively common problems in adolescent girls, and non-pharmacological treatment options are often limited.
This case shows that an acupuncture treatment based on a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) diagnosis is an effective alternative to the more commonly used hormone therapy and is well tolerated with a prompt treatment response.
Carefully controlled trials of treatments based on TCM diagnoses for irregular uterine bleeding to assess their effectiveness on bleeding heaviness and intervals are recommended.

### Acupuncture treatment for dysfunctional uterine bleeding in an adolescent [^1152Mg7W]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Menstrual disorders are common complaints among adolescent girls. The most common cause is DUB from an ovulatory cycle resulting in irregular bleeding. After menarche, 50% of cycles are anovulatory in the first year. By the third year, 95% of cycles are regular in duration and not excessive in volume.

There are many causes of abnormal uterine bleeding. DUB is a diagnosis of exclusion. The workup should rule out pregnancy, von Willebrand disease, thyroid dysfunction, uterine structural abnormalities, Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) and other systemic, hormonal and coagulation dysfunctions.

After other diagnoses have been excluded, the treatment method for DUB depends on its severity. Observation with a menstrual calendar is appropriate for mild cases, while hospitalisation with blood transfusion may be necessary for severe cases. For the vast majority of cases of moderate DUB, conventional treatment typically involves hormonal therapy and iron supplementation.

Different medical treatment regimens studied appeared to be equally effective. Conventional regimens consist of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, progestins, combined CPs, levonorgestrel Intrauterine Device (IUDs), danazol, tranexamic acid or analogues of Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH).

Two acupuncture treatments studies for delayed menstrual cycles have shown promising results as treatment for DUB. One study showed improvement of menstrual irregularities after 14 electroacupuncture treatments in PCOS patients, another study demonstrated a greater improvement (no treatment failures) by using 'mind tranquillising and menstruation regulating' needling technique, instead of traditional needling placement, every other day for three cycles.

Acupuncture with or without medicinal herbs has been widely used for women's menstrual disorders in China and Taiwan for at least centuries. Modern research on its mechanism and efficacy remains scarce. For selected patients, acupuncture can be an effective alternative treatment for women who suffer from DUB and/or dysmenorrhoea. Research of carefully controlled trials and randomised controlled trials on irregular bleeding to assess alternative and complementary medicine treatment effectiveness on menstrual heaviness and intervals are recommended.

### Sex matters: practice 5P's when treating young women with venous thromboembolism [^111FAnCX]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2019). Medium credibility.

To our knowledge, there are no studies that report data on menstrual bleeding patterns in women treated with unfractionated heparin or low‐molecular‐weight heparin (LMWH). Treatment duration with unfractionated heparin or LMWH is relatively short and prescribed in a prophylactic dosage in the majority of patients. Patients of fertile age treated with therapeutic‐dose LMWH often are pregnant patients or patients treated for cancer. In these populations, menstrual blood loss is either absent or a non‐issue.

2.1 Management of abnormal uterine bleeding

Abnormal uterine bleeding is chronic in nature and it negatively impacts quality of life. 21 Therefore, adequate treatment is imperative. A step‐by‐step assessment and management strategy in women using anticoagulants was recently discussed by Boonyawat and colleagues. 22 They suggest that clinical assessment includes at least evaluation of anticoagulant therapy intensity, need for ongoing anticoagulation (see also paragraph in Section 4) and evaluation of anemia and iron status. 22 Referral to a gynecologist is mandatory when additional underlying uterine abnormalities are suspected. 23

Suggested management options encompass 3 main potential approaches: (a) hormonal therapy, (b) tranexamic acid and (c) modification of anticoagulant therapy. Table A1 displays an evidence‐based summary of management strategies for abnormal vaginal bleeding during anticoagulant treatment.

### Thermal balloon endometrial ablation for management of acute uterine hemorrhage [^111Huk5N]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Life-threatening abnormal uterine bleeding can be managed by a variety of techniques, which include intravenous estrogen, dilation and curettage, endometrial ablation, uterine artery embolization, or hysterectomy. Thermal balloon endometrial ablation has been used in the management of chronic dysfunctional uterine bleeding but has not been described in a case of acute uterine hemorrhage.

Case

A 44-year-old woman with end-stage liver disease presented with vaginal bleeding and fever. She was found to have sepsis, coagulopathy, and anemia. No anatomic uterine pathology was identified. Antibiotics, intravenous estrogen, and blood products were administered, but heavy bleeding persisted. Thermal balloon ablation resulted in abrupt cessation of uterine bleeding.

Conclusion

Thermal balloon ablation appears to be an effective method for management of acute uterine hemorrhage.

### Medical treatment of fibroids: FIGO best practice guidance [^113jS3tH]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Even though uterine fibroids are a widespread condition, the range of approved medical treatment options remains limited. In fact, only a few drugs are officially approved for the therapy of fibroids. In both the United States and the European Medicines Agency region, selected gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonists have been approved for this indication. GnRH analogs are primarily indicated for the preoperative management of uterine fibroids, largely because of their unfavorable long-term adverse effect profile. The previously approved therapy with ulipristal acetate had to undergo extensive restrictions because of safety concerns. Nevertheless, there are additional medications that may be used in clinical practice. These include combined oral contraceptives, oral progestins, the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS), and tranexamic acid. Although not specifically approved for the treatment of fibroids, these agents can reduce the intensity of bleeding in cases of heavy menstrual bleeding and thereby improve symptoms and lead to an improved quality of life for the patients.

### Diagnosis and classification of uterine fibroids [^111zhEJ2]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Uterine fibroids, or leiomyomas, are benign uterine tumors with a lifetime prevalence of approximately 75%. While only a minority become symptomatic, their impact on quality of life remains profound owing to heavy menstrual bleeding, bulk symptoms, and reproductive dysfunction. Interestingly, fibroids are not reliably diagnosed on physical examination, nor can their impact be predicted through palpation. Consequently, the diagnosis and phenotypic categorization of uterine fibroids relies primarily on imaging to guide subsequent clinical management. Ultrasound should be the first‐line diagnostic modality, and magnetic resonance imaging should be reserved for complex cases and/or surgical planning. Adherence to standardized structured reporting across imaging modalities is critical to improve diagnostic accuracy, differentiate fibroids from conditions such as adenomyosis or malignancies, predict therapeutic responses, and plan surgical interventions. Imaging reports should follow the FIGO classification system for uterine fibroids, to enable a standardized description of their relationship to the endometrium, myometrium, and uterine serosa.

### The two FIGO systems for normal and abnormal uterine bleeding symptoms and classification of causes of abnormal uterine bleeding in the reproductive years: 2018 revisions [^115L1hCU]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) systems for nomenclature of symptoms of normal and abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) in the reproductive years (FIGO AUB System 1) and for classification of causes of AUB (FIGO AUB System 2; PALM-COEIN) were first published together in 2011. The purpose was to harmonize the definitions of normal and abnormal bleeding symptoms and to classify and subclassify underlying potential causes of AUB in the reproductive years to facilitate research, education, and clinical care. The systems were designed to be flexible and to be periodically reviewed and modified as appropriate.

Objectives

To review, clarify, and, where appropriate, revise the previously published systems.

Methodology and Outcome

To a large extent, the process has been an iterative one involving the FIGO Menstrual Disorders Committee, as well as a number of invited contributions from epidemiologists, gynecologists, and other experts in the field from around the world between 2012 and 2017. Face-to-face meetings have been held in Rome, Vancouver, and Singapore, and have been augmented by a number of teleconferences and other communications designed to evaluate various aspects of the systems. Where substantial change was considered, anonymous voting, in some instances using a modified RAND Delphi technique, was utilized.

### Co-occurrence of endometriosis and uterine fibroids: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1114fpZW]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

This issue has both methodological and clinical implications. In general outpatient settings, fibroids are more likely to go undetected compared to specialist centers that manage endometriosis, where patients typically present with complex or severe symptoms requiring thorough diagnostic work-up. In such settings, recognizing the potential co-occurrence of fibroids and endometriosis is essential to ensure accurate evaluation and appropriate clinical management.

Although fibroids are asymptomatic in some patients, approximately 30% of women experience significant symptoms, including severe pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, non-cyclic pelvic pain, infertility, abnormal uterine bleeding, heavy menstrual bleeding, fatigue, dyspareunia, and bladder or bowel dysfunction. Notably, symptoms of fibroids may overlap with those of endometriosis or adenomyosis, highlighting the importance for clinicians to remain vigilant about possible co-occurrence. For instance, in the setting of infertility, concurrent adenomyosis and fibroids have been identified in up to 20% of infertile women with endometriosis. Therefore, in cases of endometriosis-associated infertility, the presence of coexisting fibroids may influence treatment decisions and patient prognosis. Similarly, the presence of uterine fibroids in women with adenomyosis-associated abnormal uterine bleeding should inform treatment choices within a shared decision-making framework, balancing short- and long-term therapeutic goals and reproductive desires. Furthermore, women presenting with significant pain despite relatively small fibroids may have concomitant endometriosis and adenomyosis, a co-occurrence clinicians should be mindful of when evaluating and managing patients.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis providing a quantitative estimate of the burden of uterine fibroids in women with endometriosis. A major strength of this study is the large sample size (over 3 million patients), enabling robust estimates of effect. Additionally, we performed a sensitivity analysis restricted to studies where controls without endometriosis were asymptomatic women representative of an outpatient setting. This methodological approach aimed to reduce misclassification bias (due to undiagnosed endometriosis in symptomatic controls) and to minimize potential outcome detection bias, as fibroids might be overdiagnosed in women undergoing evaluation or surgery for gynecological symptoms. Indeed, the retrospective design and specific characteristics of healthcare systems in many studies included in our meta-analysis may introduce selection bias, especially considering that most of these studies were conducted in referral centres predominantly visited by patients experiencing uterine diseases and pelvic pain. However, we acknowledge that these control groups may still include undiagnosed cases or women with subclinical gynecological conditions, and thus may not represent truly disease-free populations.

### Endometrial ablation in women with abnormal uterine bleeding related to ovulatory dysfunction: a cohort study [^115aBa4q]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

Study Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of endometrial ablation (EA) for the treatment of abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) associated with ovulatory dysfunction.

Design

A retrospective cohort study (Canadian Task Force classification II-2).

Setting

An academic medical center.

Patients

Women with AUB who underwent EA during an 8-year period.

Interventions

EA by radiofrequency or thermal balloon ablation techniques.

Measurements and Main Results

Women with AUB were divided into 2 groups: irregular bleeding with ovulatory dysfunction (AUB-O) or regular heavy bleeding related to a primary endometrial disorder (AUB-E). Outcome measures included rates of amenorrhea and treatment failure (ie, need for reablation or hysterectomy). Outcomes were compared between groups using survival analyses and chi-square tests. Known confounders were adjusted for using Cox and logistic regression models. Five-year cumulative treatment failure rates were 11.7% (95% confidence interval, 6.5%-16.9%) for AUB-O and 12.3% (95% CI, 8.4%-16.2%) for AUB-E (p = .62). The unadjusted hazard ratio for treatment failure was 0.87 (95% CI, 0.72–1.05, p = .16). After adjusting for known risk factors for failure, the hazard ratio was 1.48 (95% CI, 0.82–2.65, p = .19). The rates of amenorrhea were 11.8% for AUB-O and 13.8% for AUB-E with an unadjusted odds ratio of 0.84 (95% CI, 0.48–1.48, p = .55). After adjusting for factors for amenorrhea after EA, the odds ratio was 1.08 (95% CI, 0.62–1.84, p = .78). No pregnancies or endometrial cancers occurred after EA.

Conclusion

EA is effective in women with AUB-O and can be used as an alternative to hysterectomy or in patients with contraindications to medical management of AUB-O.

### FIGO classification system (PALM-COEIN) for causes of abnormal uterine bleeding in nongravid women of reproductive age [^115jZvLk]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2011). Low credibility.

There is general inconsistency in the nomenclature used to describe abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB), in addition to a plethora of potential causes-several of which may coexist in a given individual. It seems clear that the development of consistent and universally accepted nomenclature is a step toward rectifying this unsatisfactory circumstance. Another requirement is the development of a classification system, on several levels, for the causes of AUB, which can be used by clinicians, investigators, and even patients to facilitate communication, clinical care, and research. This manuscript describes an ongoing process designed to achieve these goals, and presents for consideration the PALM-COEIN (polyp; adenomyosis; leiomyoma; malignancy and hyperplasia; coagulopathy; ovulatory dysfunction; endometrial; iatrogenic; and not yet classified) classification system for AUB, which has been approved by the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) Executive Board as a FIGO classification system.

### Screening and management of bleeding disorders in adolescents with heavy menstrual bleeding: ACOG COMMITTEE OPINION SUMMARY, number 785 [^1121vm1s]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). Medium credibility.

Heavy menstrual bleeding is defined as excessive menstrual blood loss that interferes with a woman's physical, social, emotional, or material quality of life. If obstetrician-gynecologists suspect that a patient has a bleeding disorder, they should work in coordination with a hematologist for laboratory evaluation and medical management. Evaluation of adolescent girls who present with heavy menstrual bleeding should include assessment for anemia from blood loss, including serum ferritin, the presence of an endocrine disorder leading to anovulation, and evaluation for the presence of a bleeding disorder. Physical examination of the patient who presents with acute heavy menstrual bleeding should include assessment of hemodynamic stability, including orthostatic blood pressure and pulse measurements. The first-line approach to acute bleeding in the adolescent is medical management; surgery should be reserved for those who do not respond to medical therapy. Use of antifibrinolytics such as tranexamic acid or aminocaproic acid in oral and intravenous form may be used to stop bleeding. Nonmedical procedures should be considered when there is a lack of response to medical therapy, if the patient is clinically unstable despite initial measures, or when severe heavy bleeding warrants further investigation, such as an examination under anesthesia. After correction of acute heavy menstrual bleeding, maintenance hormonal therapy can include combined hormonal contraceptives, oral and injectable progestins, and levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine devices. Obstetrician-gynecologists can provide important guidance to premenarchal and postmenarchal girls and their families about issues related to menses and should counsel all adolescent patients with a bleeding disorder about safe medication use and future surgical considerations.

### Special considerations for women of reproductive age on anticoagulation [^116QcHsm]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

ABNORMAL UTERINE BLEEDING EXPERIENCED BY REPRODUCTIVE AGE WOMEN ON ANTICOAGULATION

Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) includes heavy menstrual bleeding and bleeding at times outside the usual menstrual cycle (i.e. intermenstrual, postcoital). Heavy menstrual bleeding is menstrual blood loss that interferes with a women's physical, social, emotional, or material quality of life, or quantified as loss of > 80mL menstrual blood loss per cycle in research. Clinical signs of such bleeding include changing a pad or tampon more than hourly, leaking or soaking through clothing, having to change pads or tampons overnight, menses lasting more than 7 days, and passing clots greater than 2.8 cm. This can result in fatigue, shortness of breath, or lightheadedness as a result of anemia. When poorly controlled, abnormal uterine bleeding can interfere with work responsibilities and has significant adverse effects on quality of life.

For women on oral anticoagulation, rates of uterine bleeding related to anticoagulant medications in pharmaceutical event reports have been estimated at 2 to 4%. However, this likely underestimates the frequency of troublesome AUB given few women of reproductive age were included in these studies and menstrual history was not collected in a standardized fashion. Observational studies report higher rates of AUB for women on DOACs ranging from 15.8 to 50%, and up to 66% for women on warfarin.– These studies have indicated that dabigatran may be the preferred anticoagulant for menstruating women, as it has demonstrated lower rates of AUB than warfarin when used by this population. – This is hypothesized to result from the high concentration of thrombin in the endometrium, where available thrombin may exceed dabigatran-induced thrombin inhibition to decrease menstrual bleeding. Rivaroxaban has, in contrast, repeatedly demonstrated worse AUB than apixaban, edoxaban, dabigatran, or warfarin, including with severe uterine bleeding requiring blood transfusion or surgical management. Rates of AUB with use of common anticoagulants are compared in Table 2.

### U.S. selected practice recommendations for contraceptive use, 2024 [^117XTYh5]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). High credibility.

Levonorgestrel intrauterine device (LNG-IUD) — bleeding irregularities and management: During contraceptive counseling before placement, discuss spotting or light bleeding, especially during the first 3–6 months of use, and note that approximately half of LNG-IUD users are likely to experience amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea by 2 years of use; these bleeding irregularities are generally not harmful but might be bothersome. Enhanced counseling and reassurance have been reported to reduce method discontinuation with other hormonal contraceptives. If the patient desires LNG-IUD removal, remove the LNG-IUD and counsel on alternative methods and initiate another method if desired. For treatment of bleeding irregularities with 52 mg LNG-IUDs, RCTs of tranexamic acid, mefenamic acid, and UPA observed no differences versus placebo in bleeding outcomes over 90 days, whereas a prospective cohort with a 3-month treatment found a significant reduction in bleeding days after 90 days but 68% of patients experienced side effects.

### Diagnosis and classification of uterine fibroids [^115BvmHq]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Uterine fibroids, also referred to as leiomyomas, are benign uterine tumors with a lifetime prevalence of approximately 75% depending on race, age, and a variety of genetic and environmental factors,(although the terms can be used interchangeably, uterine fibroids/fibroids will be used across this article for consistency). While many individuals remain asymptomatic, approximately 30% of those affected experience symptoms that impact their overall quality of life. Furthermore, when symptoms occur, they may not be related to the fibroids since abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB), infertility, recurrent pregnancy loss, pressure, pain, urinary frequency, or gastrointestinal dysfunction may be present with a variety of otherwise unrelated conditions. The epidemiology and pathogenesis of uterine fibroids have been discussed elsewhere in this special collection. In this article we explore their classification, symptomatology, and diagnosis. First, we discuss the origins of classification systems designed to aid basic and clinical research, as well as education and clinical care.

### Developing the FIGO-IPPS "R U MOVVING SOMe" classification system for female chronic pelvic pain [^111kpEZQ]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

The primary objective of this project was to respond to the FIGO‐IPPS call to actionand develop a pragmatic classification system for conditions associated with CPP that attempts to fulfill these requirements. We aimed to create a classification system for CPP that mirrors existing successful models for classifying conditions with similar impacts. A predicate example can be found in the widely recognized FIGO system for characterizing the symptoms and classifying the causes of non‐gestational abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) in the reproductive years. This classification system, known by the acronym PALM‐COEIN, has successfully transformed education, research, and the diagnosis and management of AUB by standardizing terminology and guiding healthcare practices.

Although we acknowledge the potential challenges to creating a practical but comprehensive classification system for CPP, we recognize several parallels between CPP and AUB, as both conditions are associated with multiple possible causes and comorbidities, impact a large proportion of the global female population, and profoundly and negatively affect women's lives and well‐being. Furthermore, developing a comprehensive classification system for CPP, analogous to that for AUB, requires collaboration from diverse stakeholders, including international medical specialty and subspecialty societies, patients, individuals with personal experience of pain, advocacy groups, researchers, healthcare professionals, and educators. Therefore, by engaging these diverse stakeholders, this project aims to establish a practical classification system that standardizes CPP terminology, enhances education, and improves global diagnosis and management.

### The FIGO ovulatory disorders classification system [^1142hfin]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2022). Medium credibility.

FIGO AUB System 1 describes non‐gestational normal and AUB in the reproductive years and addresses the features of menstruation, that is, frequency, regularity, duration, and perceived volume of menstrual blood loss in addition to the presence of bleeding between periods (intermenstrual bleeding) as well as unscheduled bleeding associated with the use of gonadal steroids for contraception. The latter is now encompassed by the increasingly used term "contraceptive‐induced menstrual bleeding changes" (CiMBC). Notably, System 1 is currently based upon data from studies of women aged 18–45 years, as evidence from adolescent girls and women in the late reproductive years is less well defined.

The second system, FIGO AUB System 2, describes potential causes or contributors to symptoms of AUB that are categorized in System 1. The nine categories, arranged according to the acronym PALM‐COEIN, are as follows: Polyp (AUB‐P); Adenomyosis (AUB‐A); Leiomyoma (AUB‐L); Malignancy and hyperplasia (AUB‐M); Coagulopathy (AUB‐C); Ovulatory dysfunction (AUB‐O); Endometrial disorders (AUB‐E); Iatrogenic (AUB‐I); and Not otherwise classified (AUB‐N). For the present context, ovulatory disorders (AUB‐O) incorporate a range of disturbances in normal ovulatory function ranging from irregular to infrequent to absent ovulation. To date, in the context of management of patients with AUB, the diagnosis of ovulatory disorders has been based mainly on a detailed menstrual history to meet the parameters that comprise FIGO System 1. In the 2018 revisions of the two FIGO systems, the recommendation was made that treatments that may interfere with the H‐P‐O axis and associated with AUB be placed within the "AUB‐I" category. The rationale and methodology for developing a sub‐classification system for AUB‐O are now presented.

3 THE VALUE OF THE TWOSYSTEMS

3.1 Characterization and classification

Inconsistent terminology related to AUB was — and still is — pervasive in clinical care and the design and interpretation of basic, translational, clinical, and epidemiological research. This circumstance adversely affects the construct and interpretation of systematic reviews and meta‐analyses and, in turn, has a negative effect on clinical care, patient education and counseling, and the training of medical students, residents or registrars, and those in other postgraduate programs.

To systemize how women with AUB are evaluated, the vital step of improving and standardizing terminology used within the field was undertaken by FIGO after an extensive multistage process. International consensus using a Delphi process was sought from 2005 onward, leading to the creation of the two FIGO systems for the assessment and classification of AUB. By standardizing the descriptions of normal and abnormal menstrual function and the classification of causes of nongestational AUB in the reproductive years, communication regarding nongestational AUB can improve. Standardization fosters the creation of more homogenous populations with similar clinical features and functional and structural causes of AUB in a fashion that enhances the design and interpretation of research, facilitates education, and allows for more evidence‐based and consistent counseling of affected women regarding appropriate options.

Nongestational AUB in the reproductive years can be either acute or chronic. Chronic AUB is defined by FIGO as: "bleeding from the uterine corpus that is abnormal in volume, regularity, and/or timing, and has been present for the majority of the past 6 months". In contrast, acute AUB is: "an episode of heavy bleeding that, in the opinion of the clinician, is of sufficient quantity to require immediate intervention to prevent further blood loss".

The structured approach to diagnosis embodied in FIGO AUB Systems 1 and 2 applies to both acute and chronic AUB; however, when acute, the clinician must act expeditiously to stem the bleeding, often before a complete evaluation is possible. With both acute and chronic AUB, it is also important to remember the concurrent effect on the body's iron stores, the risk of ID and IDA, and the potential and related impacts on the patient's overall health and quality of life. It is, therefore, essential to investigate iron stores and the possibility of IDA alongside the AUB evaluation and process as guided by FIGO Systems 1 and 2.

### Predictors of response for elagolix with add-back therapy in women with heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids [^116oMZ1H]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

Further adding to the challenge of medical management of heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids is a paucity of literature on the medical management of different subgroups of women with uterine fibroids and a lack of randomized trials comparing various treatment options. A recent report from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality guidance on fibroid management showed that there is little evidence for individualized management. This subgroup analysis aims to close this gap.

Historically, factors such as uterine and fibroid volume, fibroid location, and age have been used to exclude women from medical therapy. Data from this study support the contention that all women should be offered a medical trial for the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding associated with fibroids to allow women to choose from all available, effective treatment options. This study provides information in an area with limited data and demonstrated that regardless of patient demographics and disease phenotype, elagolix with add-back therapy was effective at reducing heavy menstrual bleeding.

Treatment with elagolix with add-back therapy also demonstrated significantly decreased symptom severity and improved HRQoL in all subgroups of women. Treatment with elagolix with add-back resulted in UFS-QOL scores similar to those of women without uterine fibroids (symptom severity, 22.5; SD, 21.1; HRQoL total score, 86.4; SD, 17.7). Moreover, changes of 9 to 15 points in UFS-QOL are considered to be clinically meaningful, a target achieved across subgroups in this study (Figure 2 and Supplemental Figure 3; Supplemental Tables 4–10).

Research implications

It has been hypothesized that submucosal fibroids contribute to heavy menstrual bleeding; by extension, the further away the fibroid is from the endometrial cavity, the less likely it will be to contribute to bleeding. However, studies have demonstrated that regardless of location, fibroids are biologically active tissues that produce vasoactive and other regulatory factors that can alter the endometrium in a paracrine manner. – The consistent baseline mean menstrual blood loss (Supplemental Table 1) and efficacy of elagolix with add-back therapy across all fibroid locations by FIGO classification (Figure 1 and Supplemental Figure 2), which demonstrate reduction of heavy menstrual bleeding independent of location in this study, may support the paracrine effect of fibroids.

### Contraceptive information after endometrial ablation [^114GUGqY]. Fertility and Sterility (2005). Low credibility.

We reviewed the records of the patients considered "fertile" in a consecutive series of 206 patients treated by intrauterine balloon ablation for dysfunctional uterine bleeding, and three pregnancies were observed among 58 patients (5.2%), with two spontaneous abortions and a placenta accreta at 26 weeks. These findings lead us to conclude that balloon ablation is not contraceptive and that use of a supplemental contraceptive method should be planned. Hysteroscopic endometrial ablation and nonhysteroscopic endometrial thermal ablation are the first-line conservative surgical treatments for dysfunctional uterine bleeding. Their use reduces the rate of hysterectomies for this common problem. Because of their effects on the endometrium and uterine cavity (synechiae), these treatments are indicated only for patients who do not wish to remain fertile.

### U.S. selected practice recommendations for contraceptive use, 2024 [^114Tqcps]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). High credibility.

Cu-IUD — bleeding irregularities management and evidence: During contraceptive counseling and before placement of the Cu-IUD, common side effects including spotting or light bleeding or heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding, especially during the first 3–6 months of use, should be discussed. If the patient wants treatment during days of bleeding, NSAIDs for short-term treatment, 5–7 days, may be considered. Evidence includes a systematic review that identified 11 studies among Cu-IUD users, with Nine studies examining oral NSAIDs; however, only one NSAID study demonstrated statistically significant or notable reductions in mean total menstrual blood loss. One study among 19 Cu-IUD users with heavy bleeding suggested that oral tranexamic acid can significantly reduce mean blood loss during treatment compared with placebo, but an FDA warning states that tranexamic acid is contraindicated in women with active thromboembolic disease or with a history or intrinsic risk for thrombosis or thromboembolism. Treatment with aspirin demonstrated no statistically significant change in mean blood loss for pretreatment menstrual blood loss ≥ 80 mL or 60–80 mL and resulted in a significant increase when pretreatment menstrual blood loss was < 60 mL. A trial of intranasal desmopressin (300 μg/day) for the first 5 days of menses for three treatment cycles found a significant reduction in mean blood loss compared with baseline, while one small study of three separate NSAIDs did not observe improvements in spotting in any group.

### Teaching women's health skills: confidence, attitudes and practice patterns of academic generalist physician [^1169QS5F]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

This study assesses the readiness of academic general internists to perform and precept a commonly utilized women's health examination, and procedural and management skills.

Design

Full-time faculty from divisions of general internal medicine and departments of family practice in 9 states reported their encounter frequency with, comfort precepting, and the importance they ascribe to several examination, procedural, and management skills relevant to women's health care; and their attitudes toward performing the pelvic exam and obtaining a Pap smear.

Measurements and Main Results

A total of 331 general internal medicine physicians (GIMs) and 271 family medicine physicians (FPs) completed questionnaires, with response rates of 57% and 64%, respectively. More than 90% of GIMs and FPs indicated they were confident precepting the breast and Pap/pelvic examinations. A relatively small percentage of GIMs expressed confidence precepting the management of dysfunctional uterine bleeding (22%), initiating Depo-Provera (21%), and initiating oral contraceptives (45%), while a substantially larger percentage indicated that these skills were important to primary care practice (43%, 44%, and 85%, respectively). Although GIMs indicated they were confident precepting the Pap/pelvic exam, they were less likely than FPs to agree with the following statements: "Performing routine Pap smears is a good use of my time" (GIMs 65%, FPs 84%); "It is a waste of health care dollars for primary care physicians to refer patients to gynecologists for routine Pap/pelvic exams" (GIMs 69%, FPs 90%); "I feel very well trained to do a routine bimanual exam" (GIMs 71%, FPs 98%), and "The clinic where I practice is well equipped to do a Pap smear" (GIMs 78%, FPs 94%).

Conclusions

Although most academic GIMs are confident precepting the breast and pelvic examination, only a minority are confident precepting the management of dysfunctional uterine bleeding, initiating Depo-Provera, and initiating oral contraceptives. These findings suggest that a number of academic GIMs may not be prepared or willing to perform or precept important women's health skills.

14.4 Endometrial Thinning

Two trials were conducted with ZOLADEX prior to endometrial ablation for dysfunctional uterine bleeding.

Trial 0022, was a double-blind, prospective, randomized, parallel-group multicenter trial conducted in 358 premenopausal women with dysfunctional uterine bleeding. Eligible patients were randomized to receive either two depots of ZOLADEX 3.6 mg (n = 180) or two placebo injections (n = 178) administered four weeks apart. One hundred seventy five patients in each group underwent endometrial ablation using either diathermy loop alone or in combination with rollerball approximately 2 weeks after the second injection. Endometrial thickness was assessed immediately before surgery using a transvaginal ultrasonic probe. The incidence of amenorrhea was compared between the ZOLADEX and placebo groups at 24 weeks after endometrial ablation.

The median endometrial thickness before surgery was significantly less in the ZOLADEX treatment group (1.50 mm) compared to the placebo group (3.55 mm). Six months after surgery, 40% of patients (70/175) treated with ZOLADEX in Trial 0022 reported amenorrhea as compared with 26% who had received placebo injections (44/171), a difference that was statistically significant.

Trial 0003, was a single center, open-label, randomized trial in premenopausal women with dysfunctional uterine bleeding. The trial allowed for a comparison of 1 depot of ZOLADEX and 2 depots of ZOLADEX administered 4 weeks apart with ablation using Nd: YAG laser occurring 4 weeks after ZOLADEX administration. Forty patients were randomized into each of the ZOLADEX treatment groups.

The median endometrial thickness before surgery was significantly less in the group treated with two depots (0.5 mm) compared to the group treated with one depot (1 mm). No difference in the incidence of amenorrhea was found at 24 weeks (24% in both groups). Of the 74 patients that completed the trial, 53% reported hypomenorrhea and 20% reported normal menses six months after surgery.

### Greater prevalence of anaemia and heavy menstrual bleeding reported in women of reproductive age in the United Kingdom compared to Australia [^114AK4KP]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Medium credibility.

In addition, finger prick Hb is the most feasible methodology for mass data collectionbut, as yet, there is no validated point of care test for iron status; although ID typically accounts for the majority of anaemia cases in reproductive aged women. Moreover, we acknowledge that this study does not capture causes of abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB), such as those defined by the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO): polyp, adenomyosis, leiomyoma, malignancy and hyperplasia, coagulopathy, ovulatory dysfunction, endometrial, iatrogenic and not yet classified causes (PALM‐COEIN). Future research may also benefit from collecting data regarding potential management of HMB through contraceptive and tranexamic acid use.

To conclude, HMB was more frequently reported, and anaemia was more prevalent in reproductive‐aged women in the United Kingdom compared to Australia, suggesting the United Kingdom could benefit from exploration of differing strategies to identify and manage HMB, iron deficiency and anaemia in women of reproductive age. A review of the accessibility of IV iron in both countries and further exploration into the causality of HMB and anaemia in the United Kingdom are potential steps that could be taken to work towards addressing this health disparity.

### Bipolar radio frequency endometrial ablation compared with balloon endometrial ablation in dysfunctional uterine bleeding: impact on patients' health-related quality of life [^117JN5py]. Fertility and Sterility (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare health-related quality of life (HRQoL) after bipolar radio frequency ablation and thermal balloon ablation in women with dysfunctional uterine bleeding.

Design

Randomized clinical trial.

Setting

Teaching hospital.

Patient(S)

Women suffering from dysfunctional uterine bleeding.

Intervention(S)

Bipolar radio frequency ablation and thermal balloon ablation.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Patients were asked to complete HRQoL questionnaires at baseline, and at 2 days, 2 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after surgery. The questionnaires contained the medical outcomes study Short-Form 36 (SF-36), the Self-rating Depression Scale, the Rotterdam Symptom Checklist, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and a structured clinical history questionnaire.

Result(S)

Data on HRQoL were available on at least two different time points in 115 of 126 randomized patients. HRQoL improved significantly over time in both groups, except for the domain of general health in the SF-36. None of the dimensions showed a significant difference between both groups, neither was there a significant interaction between time and treatment effect.

Conclusion(S)

Both methods significantly improved HRQoL in women with dysfunctional uterine bleeding. However, despite better amenorrhea and satisfaction rates after bipolar radio frequency ablation, there was no difference in HRQoL between the two groups.

### Utility of the PALM-COEIN classification of abnormal uterine bleeding for Indian gynecologists [^111TVrUq]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To study the clinical utility of the PALM-COEIN classification for abnormal uterine bleeding in day-to-day practice in India.

Methods

Between April and November 2014, a cross-sectional survey was undertaken of gynecologists practicing in Chittoor and Nellore. Doctors possessing a postgraduate degree in gynecology and obstetrics, and postgraduate students in the gynecology department of medical colleges were invited to participate. A validated questionnaire containing 15 questions was distributed, the opinions were collated, and the results analyzed.

Results

Among 150 invited gynecologists, 120 agreed to participate, and 119 completed the survey fully. Overall, 95 (79.8%) respondents were aware of the classification, and 56 (47.1%) responded that the PALM-COEIN system is very good, 46 (38.7%) that it is average, and 17 (14.3%) that it is poor. By subgroup, 16 of 20 (80.0%) faculty members, 46 of 56 (82.1%) postgraduate students, and 33 of 43 (76.7%) practitioners responded that the system is useful.

Conclusion

Indian doctors generally believe that the PALM-COEIN system is clinically useful and a step forward in the management of abnormal uterine bleeding.

### Evaluation and management of abnormal uterine bleeding… [^116ZiorK]. AAFP (2012). Low credibility.

In the absence of pregnancy, estrogen and progesterone levels decline, and withdrawal bleeding occurs 13 to 15 days postovulation. 2 Disruption of normal physiology, anatomic changes in the endometrium, or endometrial cancer may result in abnormal uterine bleeding. Genital bleeding during childhood, uterine bleeding that requires emergent intervention, and postmenopausal uterine bleeding are also abnormal, but are beyond the scope of this article. 4 Terms commonly associated with anovulatory bleeding include amenorrhea, oligomenorrhea, metrorrhagia, and dysfunctional uterine bleeding.

2 The term dysfunctional uterine bleeding is sometimes used to encompass many other abnormal uterine bleeding patterns, so for clarity and consistency with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, this article uses the term anovulatory abnormal uterine bleeding. 4 In contrast to anovulatory patterns, ovulatory abnormal uterine bleeding occurs at regular intervals, but with excessive volume or duration of more than seven days. 2 Excessive menstrual bleeding is defined as the need to change menstrual products every one to two hours, passage of clots greater than 1 inch, and/or "very heavy" periods as reported by the patient. 5, 6 It is commonly associated with low ferritin levels. 5 Table 1 summarizes the characteristics, differential diagnosis, and evaluation of anovulatory and ovulatory abnormal uterine bleeding. 2, 4, 6–22.

When ovulation does not occur, no corpus luteum forms to produce progesterone, leading to prolonged estrogenic stimulation of the endometrium, excessive proliferation, endometrial instability, and erratic bleeding. Surgery. Uterine polyps and leiomyomas, specifically submucosal fibroids, may cause menorrhagia. Available evidence suggests that hysteroscopic polypectomy reduces 75 to 100 percent of abnormal uterine bleeding symptoms in women with endometrial polyps. 17 For menorrhagia associated with submucosal fibroids, surgical resection may allow women to maintain child-bearing capacity.

### Clinical manifestations and treatment of dysfunctional uterine bleeding… [^115EZtcu]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Dysfunctional uterine bleeding is a common gynecologic disorder that can affect any woman during her reproductive years. It is a diagnosis of exclusion, and the clinician must proceed through a logical stepwise evaluation to rule out all other causes of the abnormal bleeding. In most cases dysfunctional uterine bleeding is associated with anovulation. During the pubertal and perimenopausal periods, anovulatory bleeding is a common occurrence. During these transitional states, the abnormal bleeding has a physiological basis and is secondary to an estrogen withdrawal. Anovulatory bleeding can also be associated with chronic anovulation. The chronic unopposed estrogen that characterizes this disorder causes a continuous proliferation of the endometrium; this can result in abnormal bleeding and place the patient at risk for endometrial cancer. The goals of treatment for anovulatory bleeding are to stop the acute bleeding, avert future episodes, and prevent long-term complications.

In some cases surgical intervention is indicated, but the foundation of treatment has been a medical approach. Several progestational agents have demonstrated effectiveness and can be administered either orally or by intramuscular injection. If the patient fails to have resolution of the bleeding with medical therapy, another cause of the bleeding must be suspected, and reevaluation is necessary. Bayer SR, DeCherney AH. Clinical Manifestations and Treatment of Dysfunctional Uterine Bleeding. JAMA. 1993; 269: 1823–1828.
