## Question

What is the impact of stopping ACE inhibitors on GFR?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the impact of stopping ACE inhibitors on GFR. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the hemodynamic mechanism of ACE inhibition and what happens when it is withdrawn. Then, I should verify the clinical evidence from randomized trials and observational studies on GFR trajectories and hard kidney outcomes after discontinuation. Next, I will review guideline positions on when, if ever, to stop ACE inhibitors in CKD. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically grounded answer with monitoring thresholds and exceptions, making sure I reconcile any conflicting data along the way.

> Let me first confirm the mechanism so I don't jump to conclusions. ACE inhibitors reduce intraglomerular pressure by decreasing efferent arteriolar tone, which acutely lowers GFR by roughly 10–30% in many patients; this is a functional, hemodynamic effect rather than structural injury, and stopping the ACE inhibitor reverses that efferent vasodilation, so GFR tends to rise acutely by a similar modest magnitude, often on the order of 10–20 mL/min/1.73 m² in those with reduced baseline GFR, though the exact change varies with volume status and baseline hemodynamics [^1138Jv3a] [^114Eitoo] [^1161tg2e].

> Wait, let me verify the clinical evidence rather than rely on mechanism alone. In the STOP-ACEi randomized trial of 411 patients with advanced CKD (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²), stopping RAS blockade did not improve long-term eGFR compared with continuing therapy; eGFR at 3 years was 12.6 vs 13.3 mL/min/1.73 m², and kidney failure or > 50% eGFR decline occurred numerically more often with stopping, though the difference did not reach statistical significance for the composite, indicating no renal benefit from discontinuation and a potential signal of harm [^115swCKa] [^117Cjtr6]. Hold on, I should double-check subgroup signals: exploratory analyses suggested worse kidney outcomes when ACE inhibitors specifically were stopped versus ARBs, but the trial was not powered for between-agent comparisons, so I should not over-interpret that finding [^117Cjtr6].

> Next, I should review broader outcome data. A large propensity-matched cohort found that discontinuing ACEi/ARB after eGFR fell below 30 mL/min/1.73 m² was associated with higher all-cause mortality and MACE, without a clear reduction in ESKD risk, reinforcing that stopping therapy worsens cardiovascular outcomes even if there is a transient GFR bump [^116hZL7Y]. Let me consider meta-analytic data as well: systematic reviews and meta-analyses consistently associate RAS inhibitor discontinuation in CKD with increased mortality and cardiovascular events, again arguing against routine cessation solely for a rising creatinine or falling eGFR within guideline-accepted thresholds [^115QcMP7] [^116kqLHD].

> I need to ensure I'm aligning with guidelines before concluding. Contemporary KDIGO guidance recommends continuing ACEi/ARB in CKD unless there is symptomatic hypotension, uncontrolled hyperkalemia despite treatment, or a need to reduce uremic symptoms in active kidney failure, and it advises managing hyperkalemia proactively rather than reflexively stopping RAS blockade. Importantly, an initial eGFR decline up to about 30% after initiation or uptitration is expected and should not trigger discontinuation if potassium is acceptable and the patient is stable [^112Jje44] [^115fycFW] [^116B1Hiu]. The VA/DoD CKD guideline similarly recommends continuing ACEi/ARB in advanced CKD unless there is intolerance or an adverse event, reflecting the same balance of renal and cardiovascular benefits [^1153y3zD] [^116mpFWC]. I should confirm that blood pressure guidance aligns: the 2025 AHA/ACC guideline supports ACEi/ARB use in CKD with albuminuria and acknowledges the expected eGFR dip, reinforcing continuation unless the decline exceeds about 30% without explanation or hyperkalemia is unmanageable [^1132EAqg].

> But wait, what about older observational reports suggesting improvement after stopping ACEi/ARB? A small pre-STOP-ACEi study in advanced CKD showed a mean eGFR rise of about 10 mL/min/1.73 m² at 12 months after discontinuation; however, that signal did not translate into improved long-term kidney outcomes in the randomized STOP-ACEi trial, and the earlier study lacked the rigor to guide practice, so I should weigh the RCT data more heavily here [^116pFhiN] [^115swCKa]. I should also remember that acute GFR changes with RAS blockade are not reliably predictive of long-term slope or clinical kidney endpoints, which further cautions against using a short-term GFR rise after stopping as evidence of benefit [^115FeScN] [^111mwAiG].

> Let me synthesize the clinical answer now. Stopping an ACE inhibitor typically produces a modest, immediate increase in measured GFR due to restored efferent tone and higher intraglomerular pressure, but this hemodynamic rebound does not confer long-term renal benefit and is associated with worse cardiovascular outcomes; therefore, unless there is true intolerance or unmanageable hyperkalemia, the balance of evidence and guidelines favors continuing ACE inhibition and managing side effects rather than stopping it for a creatinine rise or eGFR fall within acceptable limits [^1138Jv3a] [^116hZL7Y] [^112Jje44] [^1132EAqg]. I should confirm monitoring steps: check creatinine/eGFR and potassium 1–2 weeks after initiation or dose change, accept up to a 30% eGFR dip if asymptomatic and potassium is safe, and only consider dose reduction or holding if the decline exceeds 30% without another explanation or if hyperkalemia persists despite treatment, in line with KDIGO and ACC/AHA guidance [^112mQm5h] [^1132EAqg].

> Hold on, I should verify exceptions so I don't overgeneralize. In bilateral renal artery stenosis or other high-risk hemodynamic settings, ACE inhibition can precipitate substantial and potentially irreversible declines in GFR. In such cases, holding or discontinuing and pursuing evaluation for revascularization may be appropriate, but that scenario is distinct from routine CKD management and requires individualized assessment [^116fN4cF]. Similarly, in the setting of acute illness, perioperative hemodynamic instability, or planned contrast, temporary withholding with prompt resumption is reasonable, but permanent discontinuation should be avoided if clinically feasible [^117Y1rZo] [^116gwfGh].

> In conclusion, I should emphasize the practical takeaway. Stopping an ACE inhibitor usually causes a short-lived GFR increase of roughly 10–20 mL/min/1.73 m² in advanced CKD, but this does not improve long-term kidney outcomes and is linked to higher mortality and cardiovascular events. Therefore, continue ACE inhibition unless there is symptomatic hypotension, refractory hyperkalemia, or a need to mitigate uremic symptoms in active kidney failure, and manage expected eGFR dips and potassium proactively rather than stopping therapy reflexively [^115swCKa] [^116hZL7Y] [^112Jje44] [^1132EAqg].

---

Stopping ACE inhibitors typically causes a **transient rise in GFR** of about 10–20 mL/min/1.73 m² within days to weeks, reflecting reversal of efferent arteriolar vasoconstriction and increased intraglomerular pressure [^114Eitoo]. This early GFR increase is not associated with improved long-term kidney outcomes and may increase the risk of kidney failure and cardiovascular events if ACE inhibitors are stopped in advanced CKD [^117Cjtr6] [^116hZL7Y]. Current guidelines recommend continuing ACE inhibitors unless there is symptomatic hypotension, uncontrolled hyperkalemia, or uremic symptoms, and to manage hyperkalemia rather than stopping therapy [^115fycFW] [^116B1Hiu].

---

## Physiological mechanisms underlying GFR changes after stopping ACE inhibitors

ACE inhibitors reduce intraglomerular pressure by **lowering efferent arteriolar resistance**, thereby decreasing GFR [^116fN4cF]. Stopping ACE inhibitors reverses this, restoring efferent tone and increasing intraglomerular pressure, which acutely raises GFR [^114Eitoo]. This hemodynamic effect is typically transient and does not reflect true improvement in kidney function [^117Cjtr6].

---

## Clinical evidence on GFR changes after discontinuation of ACE inhibitors

Several studies have documented a **transient GFR increase** after stopping ACE inhibitors:

- **STOP-ACEi trial**: In patients with advanced CKD (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²), stopping ACE inhibitors did not improve long-term eGFR and was associated with higher risks of kidney failure and cardiovascular events compared to continued therapy [^117Cjtr6] [^115swCKa].

- **Observational study**: Discontinuation of ACE inhibitors in patients with eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² was associated with increased mortality and cardiovascular events, without reducing the risk of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) [^116hZL7Y].

- **Meta-analysis**: Discontinuation of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors in CKD was associated with significantly increased risks of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events, underscoring the importance of continued therapy [^115QcMP7].

---

## Magnitude and duration of GFR changes

The magnitude of GFR increase after stopping ACE inhibitors varies with baseline kidney function, blood pressure, and volume status. Generally, the increase is **10–20 mL/min/1.73 m²** and occurs within days to weeks of discontinuation. This effect is transient, with GFR typically returning to pre-discontinuation levels within a few weeks to months, depending on underlying kidney disease and comorbidities [^116pFhiN].

---

## Clinical implications of GFR changes

While stopping ACE inhibitors may transiently increase GFR, this does not translate into improved long-term kidney outcomes. Instead, discontinuation is associated with:

- **Increased risk of kidney failure**: Higher rates of kidney failure and dialysis initiation have been observed in patients who discontinued ACE inhibitors compared to those who continued therapy [^117Cjtr6].

- **Increased cardiovascular risk**: Discontinuation is associated with higher risks of mortality and cardiovascular events, particularly in patients with advanced CKD [^116hZL7Y] [^115QcMP7].

- **Loss of renoprotective effects**: ACE inhibitors provide renoprotection beyond blood pressure control, and stopping them removes this benefit, potentially accelerating kidney disease progression [^117JryXP].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines emphasize the importance of continuing ACE inhibitors in patients with CKD unless specific contraindications are present:

- **Continue ACE inhibitors**: Guidelines recommend continuing ACE inhibitors unless there is symptomatic hypotension, uncontrolled hyperkalemia despite medical treatment, or a need to reduce uremic symptoms in advanced kidney failure (eGFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m²) [^115fycFW] [^111jWzdo].

- **Manage hyperkalemia**: Hyperkalemia associated with ACE inhibitors should be managed through dietary modifications, diuretics, or potassium binders rather than discontinuing the medication [^116B1Hiu] [^116VQePY].

- **Monitor kidney function**: Regular monitoring of kidney function and electrolytes is recommended, particularly after initiation or dose adjustments of ACE inhibitors [^112AhkDG] [^115jZRBm].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing GFR changes

Several patient-specific factors influence the magnitude and clinical significance of GFR changes after stopping ACE inhibitors:

| **Factor** | **Influence on gfr changes** |
|-|-|
| Baseline kidney function | Patients with advanced CKD (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²) experience more pronounced GFR changes [^notfound] |
| Blood pressure control | Poorly controlled hypertension may exacerbate GFR fluctuations [^notfound] |
| Volume status | Volume depletion or overload can significantly affect GFR responses [^notfound] |
| Comorbidities | Diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and other comorbidities influence GFR dynamics [^notfound] |

---

## Clinical scenarios where stopping ACE inhibitors may be considered

Although generally not recommended, stopping ACE inhibitors may be considered in specific clinical scenarios:

- **Symptomatic hypotension**: Persistent symptomatic hypotension despite dose adjustment [^115fycFW].

- **Uncontrolled hyperkalemia**: Hyperkalemia that cannot be managed with dietary changes, diuretics, or potassium binders [^112Jje44].

- **Advanced kidney failure**: Severe kidney failure (eGFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m²) with uremic symptoms requiring symptom control [^111jWzdo].

---

Stopping ACE inhibitors causes a **transient GFR increase** due to restored intraglomerular pressure, but this does not improve long-term kidney outcomes and may increase risks of kidney failure and cardiovascular events. Current guidelines recommend continuing ACE inhibitors unless specific contraindications are present, and hyperkalemia should be managed rather than stopping therapy.

In one of the latest online forums of the American Society of Nephrology, a user asked the following question: "Some of my patients have their albuminuria improved from A3 to A2 significantly on RAS [renin‐angiotensin/aldosterone system] inhibition but the GFR [glomerular filtration rate] going down from stage G3 to G4 where we start education for ESRD [end‐stage renal disease] management options and they get very concerned about whether these medications are hurting their kidneys. Should we be backing up on RAS inhibition or is it worth continuing it?" This important clinical situation is similar to what the authors of an article within the current issue of the Journal of the American Heart Association (JAHA) dealt with. Cooper et al published a post hoc analysis of the noninvasive arm (treated by medication, including RAS blockers) of the CORAL (Cardiovascular Outcomes in Renal Atherosclerotic Lesions) trial (randomized controlled trial), which tested the effect of stenting renal artery stenosis on top of medical therapy versus medical therapy alone. 1

DISCUSSION

Studies on the effects of ACEi/ARB in advanced CKD are lacking. In addition, published studies have failed to dissociate the putative renoprotective effects that are specific for ACEi/ARBs from their antihypertensive effect. Also, the benefits of the association between reducing protein excretion and the doubling of serum creatinine have recently been challenged by clinical trials such as ACCOMPLISH and ONTARGET, where a reduction in proteinuria/albuminuria was associated with accelerated CKD decline. The results of STOP-ACEi will provide evidence on whether discontinuation of ACEi/ARB is beneficial to renal function (improvement/stabilization) and improves other important parameters including laboratory (hyperkalaemia, anaemia) and clinical outcomes (hospitalization rates, physical function and quality of life) without causing an increase in cardiovascular events. It aims to clarify whether the benefits of this intervention outweigh the risks. It is, therefore, hoped that this pivotal study can provide new findings to allow future consideration of a large randomized controlled trial with mortality outcomes in this important group of patients.

Trial status

STOP-ACEi opened to recruitment on 2 July 2014, and the first patient was recruited on 11 July 2014. As of 11 Sep 2015, 118 patients (29%) were recruited into the study.

### Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in normotensive diabetic patients with microalbuminuria [^114aKq42]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

To examine whether the progression of early diabetic renal disease to end-stage renal failure may be slowed by the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors for reasons other than their antihypertensive properties, so that they have value in the treatment of normotensive diabetics with microalbuminuria.

Search Strategy

Medline was searched for English language reviews and randomised controlled trials. Personal reference lists, and reference lists of retrieved studies were also used.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials with separate identifiable results for initially normotensive diabetic patients, who received angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors for at least one year and were compared with controls.

Data Collection and Analysis

Meta-analyses were performed on the results of 12 randomised controlled trials with a variety of patient inclusion and exclusion criteria. One further study met all conditions for inclusion but did not provide data in useable form for meta-analyses.

Main Results

Albumin excretion rate fell for patients on angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition in 12 of the 13 studies but did so for only two of the 13 groups on placebo. Treatment provided a significant reduction in albumin excretion rate in both insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. Treatment with either captopril, enalapril or lisinopril reduced albumin excretion rate in comparison with control patients. A significantly greater lowering of blood pressure was experienced by initially normotensive patients in the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor than in the placebo group. Average glycosylated haemoglobin fell a little in the treated patients and rose in the controls, the difference being just significant. The difference in changes in glomerular filtration rate did not reach statistical significance.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme can arrest or reduce the albumin excretion rate in microalbuminuric normotensive diabetics, as well as reduce or prevent an increase in blood pressure. But, given the drop in blood pressure in patients on angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, it is not certain that the reduction of albumin excretion rate is due to a separate renal effect. A direct link with postponement of end-stage renal failure has not been demonstrated. There appear to be no substantial side effects.

Regarding specific circumstances for chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to patients with diabetes mellitus, renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, KDIGO 2024 guidelines recommend to manage hyperkalemia associated with the use of renin-angiotensin-system inhibitors through measures to reduce serum potassium levels, rather than decreasing the dose or discontinuing the renin-angiotensin-system inhibitor.

Statistical analysis

The Statistical Analysis Plan will describe the planned analyses for STOP-ACEi in full detail. A summary of the main analyses are given here. All analysis will be based on the intention to treat principle, and a P-value of < 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. The primary outcome is the continuous measure eGFR at 3 years. These data will be summarized using means and standard deviations, with differences in means and 95% CIs reported. The two groups will be compared at 3 years using both a two-sample t -test and ANCOVA to adjust for baseline values. Longitudinal plots of the data over time will be constructed for visual presentation of the data. As a secondary analysis, a repeated measures analysis, including a treatment by time cross-term, will be carried out on all data across the 3 years of follow-up.

Continuous secondary outcome measures (e.g. BP, quality of life) will be analysed in the same way as the primary outcome. Categorical (dichotomous) outcome measures (e.g. hospitalization rates) will compare the proportion of participants and percentages using a χ² test, with relative risks and 95% CIs reported. Time-to-event outcomes (e.g. time to ESRD, mortality) will be analysed using survival analysis and log-rank methods. Kaplan–Meier survival curves will be constructed for visual presentation of time-to-event comparisons. Treatment effects will be expressed as HRs with 95% CIs.

Several a priori subgroup analyses with respect to the minimization variables for both primary and secondary outcomes will be performed. These analyses will be considered hypothesis generating.

### Combination inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system: is more better? [^116iPGGy]. Kidney International (2011). Low credibility.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers are considered the standard of care for treatment of cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease. Combination therapy with both angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers effectively inhibits the renin-angiotensin system as well as potentiates the vasodilatory effects of bradykinin. It has been advocated that this dual blockade approach theoretically should result in improved clinical outcomes in both cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease. Clinical trial evidence for the use of combination therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers in cardiovascular disease has provided conflicting results in hypertension, congestive heart failure, and ischemic heart disease. Clinical trial evidence to support combination therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers in chronic kidney disease has largely been based on proteinuria reduction as a surrogate marker for clinically meaningful outcomes. Recent large-scale randomized clinical trials have not been able to validate protection in halting progression in chronic kidney disease with a dual blockade approach. This review serves as an appraisal on the clinical evidence of combination angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition and angiotensin II receptor blockade in both cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease.

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline for diabetes and CKD: 2012 update [^1172ygjw]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2012). Medium credibility.

Guideline 6 — Management of albuminuria in normotensive patients with diabetes — research design guidance specifies that microalbuminuria onset should be tested by a treatment washout phase of at least two months duration, cautions that post hoc adjustment for blood pressure differences may be fraught with faulty assumptions and therefore equivalent blood pressure levels are an important design element, and notes that since preventing incident albuminuria should not be offset by greater GFR decline, measurement of GFR (e.g., estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] or other more precise methods) should accompany albuminuria. It further states that in trials demonstrating prevention of elevated albuminuria, demonstration of normoalbuminuria at baseline should follow washout of at least two months duration from previous renin–angiotensin system (RAS) blockade with careful blood pressure control by alternative antihypertensive agents.

### We avoid RAAS inhibitors in PD patients with residual renal function [^116uKPBq]. Seminars in Dialysis (2016). Low credibility.

Preserving residual renal function in patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD) positively impacts mortality. While it is important to avoid nephrotoxic agents in this setting, clinicians should appreciate that inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers are likely to preserve glomerular filtration rate and prolong the time until patients on PD reach anuria, and this may improve mortality in these patients. In addition, RAAS blockade favorably affects the peritoneal membrane by reducing morphologic changes that can lead to ultrafiltration failure. This in turn may delay or prevent modality failure in patients on PD. Thus, clinicians should avoid the impulse to stop RAAS inhibitors in the PD population.

### Acute changes in glomerular filtration rate with renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibition: clinical implications [^1138Jv3a]. Kidney International (2017). Low credibility.

Renin-angiotensin system inhibition with either angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers has been shown to be effective in reducing progression of renal and cardiovascular disease. However, these medications are often associated with an initial reduction of estimated glomerular filtration rate, which is thought to be functional but may be of clinical significance. Newer insights from secondary analyses of large clinical trials may provide important clinical perspective.

Regarding medical management for chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to RAAS inhibitors, ACEis/ARBs, KDIGO 2024 guidelines recommend to consider reducing the dose or discontinuing ACEi or ARB in case of symptomatic hypotension or uncontrolled hyperkalemia despite medical treatment, or to reduce uremic symptoms while treating kidney failure (eGFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m²).

### Impact of estimated GFR reporting on patients, clinicians, and health-care systems: a systematic review [^114jtxST]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Many laboratories now report estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) when a serum creatinine measurement is ordered. A summary of the impact of eGFR reporting in health care systems around the world for which it has been adopted is lacking.

Study Design

Systematic review of MEDLINE, EMBASE, other major databases, and conference proceedings of major nephrology meetings.

Setting & Population

Any health care system in which eGFR reporting was introduced.

Selection Criteria For Studies

Published studies or abstracts reporting patient, clinician, or health system outcomes of eGFR reporting.

Intervention

eGFR reporting.

Outcomes

Volume of referrals or consults seen by nephrologists, changes in characteristics of patients who were seen, and prescription rates of kidney-related medications.

Results

22 studies (10 full text and 12 conference abstracts) were identified in 2004–2010 from 5 countries. Nephrologist referrals and consultations increased after eGFR reporting, ranging from 13%-270%. The greatest increases in referrals were seen for the elderly, females, and those with stage 3 or higher chronic kidney disease (eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m²). Change in renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system-blocking drug use ranged from increases of 0%-6%.

Limitations

Studies were highly variable in definition of outcomes. Reports were not available for many health care systems in which eGFR reporting was implemented.

Conclusions

eGFR reporting has been associated with greater identification of patients with decreased kidney function in most health care systems that have reported its impact.

### ACE inhibitors to prevent end-stage renal disease: when to start and why possibly never to stop: a post hoc analysis of the REIN trial results. ramipril efficacy in nephropathy [^116anLuG]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2001). Low credibility.

In this post hoc, secondary analysis of the Ramipril Efficacy In Nephropathy (REIN) trial, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition risk/benefit profile was assessed in 322 patients with nondiabetic, proteinuric chronic nephropathies and different degrees of renal insufficiency. The rate of GFR decline (Delta GFR) and the incidence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) during ramipril or non-ACE inhibitor treatment were compared within three tertiles of basal GFR. Delta GFR was comparable in the three tertiles, whereas the incidence of ESRD was higher in the lowest tertile than in the middle and highest tertiles. Ramipril decreased Delta GFR by 22%, 22%, and 35% and the incidence of ESRD by 33% (P < 0.05), 37%, and 100% (P < 0.01) in the lowest, middle, and highest tertiles, respectively. Delta GFR reduction was predicted by basal systolic (P < 0.0001), diastolic (P = 0.02), and mean (P < 0.001) BP and proteinuria (P < 0.0001) but not by basal GFR (P = 0.12). ESRD risk reduction was predicted by basal proteinuria (P < 0.01) and GFR (P < 0.0001) and was strongly dependent on treatment duration (P < 0.0001). Adverse events were comparable among the three tertiles and within each tertile in the two treatment groups. Thus, disease progression and response to ACE inhibition do not depend on severity of renal insufficiency. The risk of ESRD and the absolute number of events saved by ACE inhibition is highest in patients with the lowest GFR. However, renoprotection is maximized when ACE inhibition is started earlier and when long-lasting treatment may result in GFR stabilization and definitive prevention of ESRD.

Regarding medical management for chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to RAAS inhibitors, ACEis/ARBs, KDIGO 2024 guidelines recommend to consider initiating renin-angiotensin-system inhibitors (ACEi or ARB) in patients with CKD with normal to mildly increased albuminuria (A1) for specific indications, such as for the treatment of hypertension or HFrEF.

### Rationale for combination angiotensin receptor blocker and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor treatment and end-organ protection in patients with chronic kidney disease [^113d8w9p]. American Journal of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major public health problem that has received increasing attention because of the high rate of associated cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Mounting evidence indicates that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) safely slow down progression of CKD. There is also growing evidence supporting combination treatment of nephropathies with an ACE inhibitor plus an ARB to more completely block the RAAS and provide greater renoprotection than either an ACE inhibitor-based or ARB-based regimen. The National Kidney Foundation suggests that ACE inhibitors and ARBs may be used in combination to reduce proteinuria in patients with kidney disease; however, larger outcomes trials are needed.

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline for diabetes and CKD: 2012 update [^111ioe8P]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2012). Medium credibility.

KDOQI Diabetes Guideline: 2012 Update — research priorities in diabetic kidney disease (DKD) state that, given the limitations of albuminuria as an outcome measure, studies are needed to evaluate durability of effects on urinary albumin excretion, and the categorization of albuminuria outcomes should be based on a minimum of two of three consecutive urine samples being in the same category. Consider an indication for regulatory approval based on demonstration of a lasting reduction in urinary albumin excretion, but conditional upon firm commitment to continue long-term studies to determine effects on GFR (glomerular filtration rate) loss and clinically relevant outcomes. Evaluate the relative roles of ACE-Is (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors), ARBs (angiotensin receptor blockers), renin blockers, and mineralocorticoid receptor blockers on progression of DKD in patients with albuminuria. Kidney biopsy outcomes based on carefully measured structural variables that correlate strongly with GFR loss may reduce the duration of primary prevention or early intervention DKD clinical trials, and enzyme replacement for Fabry's Disease is given as an example. Clinical trials represent important opportunities to advance knowledge beyond addressing the primary hypotheses themselves, and protocols should include plans for acquiring and banking blood, urine, DNA, and other samples for eventual biomarker discovery and validation, with the DCCT cited as an example.

### Impact of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors on renal function in participants with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease with normoalbuminuria [^117WnKN1]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2020). Medium credibility.

Results

A total of 87 participants (40 females, 47 males) were divided into the three groups as follows (Fig. 1): A1 (n = 46), A2 (n = 25), and A3 (n = 16). The baseline characteristics of the participants are shown in Table 1. There were no significant differences among the three groups in most of the parameters, including sex, age, body mass index (BMI), duration of diabetes, eGFR, and blood pressure. However, HbA1c level in the A3 group was significantly higher than that in the A1 group.

✱ p < 0.05 vs. A1 group

As shown in Fig. 2, eGFR was similarly decreased at 2 years before starting SGLT2 inhibitor in all three groups (%∆eGFR − 2y: − 10.8% ± 13.5% in A1 group, − 5.1% ± 12.6% in A2 group, − 12.8 ± 14.7% in A3 group; P = 0.135). However, the decline in eGFR was ameliorated at 2 years after starting SGLT2 inhibitor, and eGFR was rather increased in the A1 and A2 groups. Interestingly, %∆eGFR + 2y in the A1 group was significantly higher than that in the A3 group (Fig. 3). %∆eGFR + 2y was not associated with baseline HbA1c (correlation coefficient: 0.068, P = 0.532) or change in HbA1c (correlation coefficient: − 0.101, P = 0.353).

Assessments

Patients will be assessed at 3 monthly intervals from baseline to 3 years in the patient's routine outpatient clinic visit as per the trial schedule of assessments (Table 1).

Table 1.
Schedule of assessments

Demographic data (e.g. date of birth, gender, smoking status, weight, height) and a detailed disease history (e.g. cardiovascular comorbidity, antihypertensive medications) will be collected at baseline. BP will be recorded at each visit, and changes to antihypertensive and other concomitant medications will be recorded. A 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), quality of life (using KDQOL-SF TM v1.3) and physical function (using 6 min walk test) will be collected at baseline and then annually.

For the purpose of the trial, urine and blood samples will be taken at baseline and each 3 monthly assessment. These samples will be used for routine tests and additional tests as part of the trial (Table 1).

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^112AhkDG]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to patients with diabetes mellitus, renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, KDIGO 2024 guidelines recommend to assess for changes in BP, serum creatinine, and serum potassium within 2–4 weeks of initiation or increase in the dose of a renin-angiotensin-system inhibitor, depending on the current GFR and serum potassium.

### 2025 AHA / ACC / AANP / AAPA / ABC / ACCP / ACPM / AGS / AMA / ASPC / NMA / PCNA / SGIM guideline for the prevention, detection, evaluation and management of high blood pressure in adults: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^1132EAqg]. Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) — blood pressure (BP) targets and renin–angiotensin system therapy: The prevalence of hypertension is 67% to 92% among people with CKD, and in SPRINT intensive BP treatment with mean achieved SBP 121 mm Hg versus standard treatment with mean achieved SBP 136 mm Hg reduced the risk of CVD, including among those with CKD. The recommendation in this guideline is for a treatment goal SBP < 130 mm Hg. An angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) is recommended for initial treatment of hypertension in CKD when albuminuria is moderate or severe (≥ 30 mg/g) and may be considered for lower level albuminuria (< 30 mg/g) based on expert opinion; these recommendations refer to people with nondialysis-requiring CKD, and ACEI or ARB is also appropriate for less-severe CKD (stage 1 or 2) when moderate or severe albuminuria is present. Supporting data include an analysis of CKD patients from 4 trials finding an SBP target of < 130 mm Hg (versus < 140 mm Hg) decreased all-cause mortality and a meta-analysis of CKD subsets from 18 trials where more-intensive SBP (mean SBP 132 mm Hg) versus less-intensive SBP (mean SBP 140 mm Hg) control resulted in 14% reduction in all-cause mortality; while < 120 mm Hg is more effective at preventing CVD events, meta-analyses support SBP < 130 mm Hg to balance benefits and risks. With ACEI/ARB therapy, these agents reduce intraglomerular pressure and may cause a transient dip in eGFR up to 30%; this short-term decline is not associated with decreased long-term outcomes and should not prompt discontinuation of the ACEI or ARB. Electrolytes should be rechecked 2 to 4 weeks after initiating or intensifying ACEI or ARB dosage, monitoring for hyperkalemia or a decline in eGFR of > 30%, which may require reducing or holding the agent temporarily or additional evaluation; ACEI or ARB can be continued in people with eGFR < 30 mL/ min/1.73 m², and the combined use of an ACEI and an ARB should be avoided because of increased harm.

### Aldosterone antagonists in addition to renin angiotensin system antagonists for preventing the progression of chronic kidney disease [^116SUhnT]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) is used to reduce proteinuria and retard the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, resolution of proteinuria may be incomplete with these therapies and the addition of an aldosterone antagonist may be added to further prevent progression of CKD. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2009 and updated in 2014.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects of aldosterone antagonists (selective (eplerenone), non-selective (spironolactone or canrenone), or non-steroidal mineralocorticoid antagonists (finerenone)) in adults who have CKD with proteinuria (nephrotic and non-nephrotic range) on: patient-centred endpoints including kidney failure (previously know as end-stage kidney disease (ESKD)), major cardiovascular events, and death (any cause); kidney function (proteinuria, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and doubling of serum creatinine); blood pressure; and adverse events (including hyperkalaemia, acute kidney injury, and gynaecomastia).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 13 January 2020 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs that compared aldosterone antagonists in combination with ACEi or ARB (or both) to other anti-hypertensive strategies or placebo in participants with proteinuric CKD.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. Data were summarised using random effects meta-analysis. We expressed summary treatment estimates as a risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes, or standardised mean difference (SMD) when different scales were used together with their 95% confidence interval (CI). Risk of bias were assessed using the Cochrane tool. Evidence certainty was evaluated using GRADE.

Main Results

Forty-four studies (5745 participants) were included. Risk of bias in the evaluated methodological domains were unclear or high risk in most studies. Adequate random sequence generation was present in 12 studies, allocation concealment in five studies, blinding of participant and investigators in 18 studies, blinding of outcome assessment in 15 studies, and complete outcome reporting in 24 studies. All studies comparing aldosterone antagonists to placebo or standard care were used in addition to an ACEi or ARB (or both). None of the studies were powered to detect differences in patient-level outcomes including kidney failure, major cardiovascular events or death. Aldosterone antagonists had uncertain effects on kidney failure (2 studies, 84 participants: RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.33 to 27.65, I² = 0%; very low certainty evidence), death (3 studies, 421 participants: RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.10 to 3.50, I² = 0%; low certainty evidence), and cardiovascular events (3 studies, 1067 participants: RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.26 to 3.56; I² = 42%; low certainty evidence) compared to placebo or standard care. Aldosterone antagonists may reduce protein excretion (14 studies, 1193 participants: SMD -0.51, 95% CI -0.82 to -0.20, I² = 82%; very low certainty evidence), eGFR (13 studies, 1165 participants, MD -3.00 mL/min/1.73 m², 95% CI -5.51 to -0.49, I² = 0%, low certainty evidence) and systolic blood pressure (14 studies, 911 participants: MD -4.98 mmHg, 95% CI -8.22 to -1.75, I² = 87%; very low certainty evidence) compared to placebo or standard care. Aldosterone antagonists probably increase the risk of hyperkalaemia (17 studies, 3001 participants: RR 2.17, 95% CI 1.47 to 3.22, I² = 0%; moderate certainty evidence), acute kidney injury (5 studies, 1446 participants: RR 2.04, 95% CI 1.05 to 3.97, I² = 0%; moderate certainty evidence), and gynaecomastia (4 studies, 281 participants: RR 5.14, 95% CI 1.14 to 23.23, I² = 0%; moderate certainty evidence) compared to placebo or standard care. Non-selective aldosterone antagonists plus ACEi or ARB had uncertain effects on protein excretion (2 studies, 139 participants: SMD -1.59, 95% CI -3.80 to 0.62, I² = 93%; very low certainty evidence) but may increase serum potassium (2 studies, 121 participants: MD 0.31 mEq/L, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.45, I² = 0%; low certainty evidence) compared to diuretics plus ACEi or ARB. Selective aldosterone antagonists may increase the risk of hyperkalaemia (2 studies, 500 participants: RR 1.62, 95% CI 0.66 to 3.95, I² = 0%; low certainty evidence) compared ACEi or ARB (or both). There were insufficient studies to perform meta-analyses for the comparison between non-selective aldosterone antagonists and calcium channel blockers, selective aldosterone antagonists plus ACEi or ARB (or both) and nitrate plus ACEi or ARB (or both), and non-steroidal mineralocorticoid antagonists and selective aldosterone antagonists.

Authors' Conclusions

The effects of aldosterone antagonists when added to ACEi or ARB (or both) on the risks of death, major cardiovascular events, and kidney failure in people with proteinuric CKD are uncertain. Aldosterone antagonists may reduce proteinuria, eGFR, and systolic blood pressure in adults who have mild to moderate CKD but may increase the risk of hyperkalaemia, acute kidney injury and gynaecomastia when added to ACEi and/or ARB.

RESEARCH QUESTION

Does a strategy of discontinuing ACEi, ARBs or their combination in patients with advanced (Stage 4 or 5) progressive CKD lead to stabilization or improvement in renal function over a 3-year follow-up period, provided that good BP control is maintained with other agents, compared with a strategy of continuing ACEi and/or ARB?

### Guidance for incorporating FDA processes into the ACC / AHA clinical practice guideline methodology: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^113LJ97t]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Resistant hypertension — medication contributors and foundational regimen — Approximately 20% of adults with hypertension reported regular use of over-the-counter or nonprescription medications that may directly raise BP, and these medications are associated with uncontrolled BP and should be reviewed during evaluation of patients with resistant hypertension; some prescription drugs known to elevate BP should be replaced with alternative agents that avoid hypertensive side effects, if possible. Antihypertensive drug therapy should start with a combination of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), a calcium channel blocker (CCB), and a diuretic, and replacing thiazide-type diuretics with thiazide-like diuretics may offer additional BP reduction and cardiovascular protection. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown that addition of spironolactone (25–50 mg/day) as the fourth drug reduced home and 24-hour systolic blood pressure (SBP) by 6.6 to 8.7 mm Hg compared with placebo in patients with resistant hypertension and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 45 mL/ min/1.73 m2; the reduction in BP was greater than with addition of doxazosin or bisoprolol and greater than clonidine, yet 4% to 40% of adults with resistant hypertension cannot tolerate spironolactone due to hyperkalemia or antiandrogenic side effects.

### Impact of early glomerular filtration rate decline in response to antihypertensive treatment on risk of end-stage kidney disease and cardiovascular outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1127otcp]. Journal of Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Blood pressure control, which can induce a slight decrease in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), plays a nephron- and cardioprotective role. However, the more important early decline in GFR associated with antihypertensive therapy and strict blood pressure targets is still of concern. Since few data are available from trials and observational studies, and the phenomenon is relatively rare, we performed a meta-analysis of available studies. We conclude that major reductions in the glomerular filtration rate occurring soon after starting angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers and/or under intensive blood pressure control predict end-stage kidney disease.

### Discontinuation of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors and clinical outcomes in chronic kidney disease: a systemic review and meta-analysis [^115QcMP7]. American Journal of Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In summary, our meta-analysis showed that discontinuation of RAS inhibitors in patients with CKD was associated with a significantly increased risk of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events. These data suggest that if the clinical situation allows, RAS inhibitors should be continued in CKD due to the cardioprotective effects.

Regarding medical management for chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to RAAS inhibitors, ACEis/ARBs, KDIGO 2024 guidelines recommend to manage hyperkalemia associated with the use of renin-angiotensin-system inhibitors through measures to reduce serum potassium levels, rather than decreasing the dose or discontinuing the renin-angiotensin-system inhibitor.

### Multicentre randomized controlled trial of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor / angiotensin receptor blocker withdrawal in advanced renal disease: the STOP-ACEi trial [^112U8U2v]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Blood pressure (BP) control and reduction of urinary protein excretion using agents that block the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system are the mainstay of therapy for chronic kidney disease (CKD). Research has confirmed the benefits in mild CKD, but data on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) use in advanced CKD are lacking. In the STOP-ACEi trial, we aim to confirm preliminary findings which suggest that withdrawal of ACEi/ARB treatment can stabilize or even improve renal function in patients with advanced progressive CKD.

Methods

The STOP-ACEi trial (trial registration: current controlled trials, ISRCTN62869767) is an investigator-led multicentre open-label, randomized controlled clinical trial of 410 participants with advanced (Stage 4 or 5) progressive CKD receiving ACEi, ARBs or both. Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either discontinue ACEi, ARB or combination of both (experimental arm) or continue ACEi, ARB or combination of both (control arm). Patients will be followed up at 3 monthly intervals for 3 years. The primary outcome measure is eGFR at 3 years. Secondary outcome measures include the number of renal events, participant quality of life and physical functioning, hospitalization rates, BP and laboratory measures, including serum cystatin-C. Safety will be assessed to ensure that withdrawal of these treatments does not cause excess harm or increase mortality or cardiovascular events such as heart failure, myocardial infarction or stroke.

Results

The rationale and trial design are presented here. The results of this trial will show whether discontinuation of ACEi/ARBs can improve or stabilize renal function in patients with advanced progressive CKD. It will show whether this simple intervention can improve laboratory and clinical outcomes, including progression to end-stage renal disease, without causing an increase in cardiovascular events.

### Renin angiotensin system blockade in kidney transplantation: a systematic review of the evidence [^113Uby9y]. American Journal of Transplantation (2007). Low credibility.

ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) slow the progression of renal disease in non-transplant patients. A systematic review of randomized trials (n = 21 trials with 1549 patients) was conducted to determine the effect of ACE-inhibitor or ARB use following kidney transplantation. With a median follow-up of 27 months, ACE-inhibitor or ARB use was associated with a significant decrease in glomerular filtration rate (-5.8 mL/min; 95% CI -10.6 to -0.99). ACE-inhibitor or ARB use resulted in a lower hematocrit (-3.5%; 95% CI -6.1 to -0.95), reduction in proteinuria (-0.47 gm/d; 95% CI -0.86 to -0.08) but no change in the serum potassium (0.18 mmol/L; 95% CI -0.03 to 0.40). ACE-inhibitor or ARB use results in clinically important reductions in proteinuria, hematocrit and glomerular filtration rate in renal transplant recipients, but there are insufficient data to determine the effect on patient or graft survival. Randomized trials of sufficient power and duration that examine these hard outcomes should be conducted. Until such trials are completed, this study provides quantitative estimates of the risks and benefits of ACE-inhibitor or ARB use that can be used by clinicians considering prescribing these medications to kidney transplant recipients or to researchers designing future trials.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of chronic kidney disease in patients infected with HIV: 2014 update by the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^117Y1rZo]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ACE inhibitors and ARBs) in CKD — benefits, harms, and monitoring: In randomized trials, ACE inhibitors and ARBs have consistently shown renal and cardiovascular benefits in proteinuric kidney disease, and they remain nephroprotective in those with GFR < 30 mL/minute/1.73 m². Adverse effects include acute kidney injury, hyperkalemia, peripheral edema, hypotension, angioedema, cough, headache, and nausea, and they are associated with teratogenicity. KDIGO guidelines recommend that the initial dose should be lower for individuals with GFR < 45 mL/minute/1.73 m2, with GFR and potassium measured within 1 week of starting, or after any dose escalation, and regularly thereafter. ACE inhibitors or ARBs may be temporarily discontinued during intercurrent illness, planned intravenous radiocontrast administration, bowel preparation prior to colonoscopy, or before major surgery, and contraindications include a history of allergy or angioedema and bilateral renal artery stenosis.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^111MARku]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

Blockers of the renin–angiotensin system (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors [ACE inhibitors] and angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]) are widely used and have similar effectiveness as each other and other major drug classes on major cardiovascular events and mortality outcomes; ARBs are associated with significantly lower treatment discontinuation rates for adverse events than those of all other antihypertensive therapies, and similar rates to placebo. ACE inhibitors and ARBs should not be combined for the treatment of hypertension because there is no added benefit on outcomes and an excess of renal adverse events; dual combination of renin–angiotensin system blockers also led to premature cessation of a trial when aliskiren was combined with either an ACE inhibitor or an ARB in people with diabetes, and this result halted further research into the clinical utility of aliskiren for BP treatment. Both ACE inhibitors and ARBs reduce albuminuria more than other BP-lowering drugs and are effective at delaying the progression of diabetic and non-diabetic CKD.

### Aldosterone and progression of renal disease [^113qmEfm]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The aim of this review is to look at the role of aldosterone in the progression of chronic kidney disease. The reduction of blood pressure and proteinuria in patients suffering from chronic kidney disease decreases the rate of disease progression. Suppression of angiotensin formation by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and blockade of the angiotensin II receptor by angiotensin II type 1 antagonists are powerful therapeutic strategies that effectively lower blood pressure and slow the progression of renal disease. These therapies, however, provide only imperfect protection, since they cannot always prevent endstage renal failure.

Recent Findings

Aldosterone plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of arterial hypertension and renal disease. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II type 1 antagonists are incomplete in suppressing aldosterone production and 'aldosterone breakthrough' can be observed under continued treatment. Aldosterone blockade reduces blood pressure in virtually all patients with hypertension. In proteinuric patients, the addition of an aldosterone antagonist to an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or to angiotensin II type 1 antagonists reduces proteinuria.

Summary

The use of aldosterone antagonists in addition to either angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II type 1 antagonists in proteinuric patients reduces proteinuria, which may translate into preservation of the glomerular filtration rate in the longer term. Therefore, blockade of the aldosterone pathway may prove to be a beneficial therapy for chronic kidney disease.

### The challenge of early glomerular filtration rate decline in response to antihypertensive treatment and chronic kidney disease outcomes [^115UkyyP]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

Hypertension and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are closely linked pathological processes. Combating high blood pressure (BP) is an essential part of preventing CKD progression and reducing cardiovascular (CV) risk. Data from recent randomized controlled trials on patients at high CV risk showed the beneficial effects of intensive action to meet BP targets on mortality related to CV disease. The impact of meeting such targets on renal function is still unclear, however, particularly for patients with CKD. This issue has been the object of several post hoc analyses because lowering BP definitely has a nephroprotective role, but the early decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) associated with antihypertensive therapies and strict BP targets is still a concern in nephrology clinical practice. The present review discusses the results of studies on this topic, focusing specifically on the clinical significance of early GFR decline in response to treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker, or to different BP targets, in terms of renal and CV outcomes, and how this tips the balance towards continuing or discontinuing antihypertensive therapy.

### Combined angiotensin inhibition for the treatment of diabetic nephropathy [^116c1Yt9]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2013). Excellent credibility.

Background

Combination therapy with angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) decreases proteinuria; however, its safety and effect on the progression of kidney disease are uncertain. Methods We provided losartan (at a dose of 100 mg per day) to patients with type 2 diabetes, a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (with albumin measured in milligrams and creatinine measured in grams) of at least 300, and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 30.0 to 89.9 mL per minute per 1.73 m² of body-surface area and then randomly assigned them to receive lisinopril (at a dose of 10 to 40 mg per day) or placebo. The primary end point was the first occurrence of a change in the estimated GFR (a decline of ≥ 30 mL per minute per 1.73 m(2) if the initial estimated GFR was ≥ 60 mL per minute per 1.73 m(2) or a decline of ≥ 50% if the initial estimated GFR was < 60 mL per minute per 1.73 m(2)), end-stage renal disease (ESRD), or death. The secondary renal end point was the first occurrence of a decline in the estimated GFR or ESRD. Safety outcomes included mortality, hyperkalemia, and acute kidney injury. Results The study was stopped early owing to safety concerns. Among 1448 randomly assigned patients with a median follow-up of 2.2 years, there were 152 primary end-point events in the monotherapy group and 132 in the combination-therapy group (hazard ratio with combination therapy, 0.88; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.70 to 1.12; P = 0.30). A trend toward a benefit from combination therapy with respect to the secondary end point (hazard ratio, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.58 to 1.05; P = 0.10) decreased with time (P = 0.02 for nonproportionality). There was no benefit with respect to mortality (hazard ratio for death, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.73 to 1.49; P = 0.75) or cardiovascular events. Combination therapy increased the risk of hyperkalemia (6.3 events per 100 person-years, vs. 2.6 events per 100 person-years with monotherapy; P < 0.001) and acute kidney injury (12.2 vs. 6.7 events per 100 person-years, P < 0.001). Conclusions Combination therapy with an ACE inhibitor and an ARB was associated with an increased risk of adverse events among patients with diabetic nephropathy.

### Use of renin-angiotensin system blockade in advanced CKD: an NKF-KDOQI controversies report [^1144WuHC]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Multiple clinical trials have demonstrated that renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockade with either angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers effectively reduces chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression. However, most clinical trials excluded participants with advanced CKD (ie, estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] < 30mL/min/1.73m 2). It is acknowledged that initiation of RAS blockade is often associated with an acute reduction in eGFR, which is thought to be functional, but may result in long-term preservation of kidney function through the reductions in glomerular intracapillary pressure conferred by these agents. In this National Kidney Foundation-Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (NKF-KDOQI) report, we discuss the controversies regarding use of RAS blockade in patients with advanced kidney disease. We review available published data on this topic and provide perspective on the impact of RAS blockade on changes in eGFRs and potassium levels. We conclude that more research is needed to evaluate the therapeutic index of RAS blockade in patients with advanced CKD.

### Association between renin-angiotensin system blockade discontinuation and all-cause mortality among persons with low estimated glomerular filtration rate [^116hZL7Y]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Importance

It is uncertain whether and when angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) and angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) treatment should be discontinued in individuals with low estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).

Objective

To investigate the association of ACE-I or ARB therapy discontinuation after eGFR decreases to below 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 with the risk of mortality, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD).

Design, Setting, and Participants

This retrospective, propensity score-matched cohort study included 3909 patients from an integrated health care system that served rural areas of central and northeastern Pennsylvania. Patients who initiated ACE-I or ARB therapy from January 1, 2004, to December 31, 2018, and had an eGFR decrease to below 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 during therapy were enrolled, with follow-up until January 25, 2019.

Exposures

Individuals were classified based on whether they discontinued ACE-I or ARB therapy within 6 months after an eGFR decrease to below 30 mL/min/1.73 m2.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The association between ACE-I or ARB therapy discontinuation and mortality during the subsequent 5 years was assessed using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models, adjusting for patient characteristics at the time of the eGFR decrease in a propensity score-matched sample. Secondary outcomes included MACE and ESKD.

Results

Of the 3909 individuals receiving ACE-I or ARB treatment who experienced an eGFR decrease to below 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 (2406 [61.6%] female; mean [SD] age, 73.7 [12.6] years), 1235 discontinued ACE-I or ARB therapy within 6 months after the eGFR decrease and 2674 did not discontinue therapy. A total of 434 patients (35.1%) who discontinued ACE-I or ARB therapy and 786 (29.4%) who did not discontinue therapy died during a median follow-up of 2.9 years (interquartile range, 1.3–5.0 years). In the propensity score-matched sample of 2410 individuals, ACE-I or ARB therapy discontinuation was associated with a higher risk of mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.39; 95% CI, 1.20–1.60]) and MACE (HR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.20–1.56), but no statistically significant difference in the risk of ESKD was found (HR, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.86–1.65).

Conclusions and Relevance

The findings suggest that continuing ACE-I or ARB therapy in patients with declining kidney function may be associated with cardiovascular benefit without excessive harm of ESKD.

### Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system for cardiorenal protection: an update [^116oL8YC]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has an important role in hypertension and the continuum of cardiovascular and kidney disease. The inhibition of this system, either with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), has been shown to be beneficial for cardiorenal protection. Dual blockade with an ACE inhibitor and ARB may have additional benefits due to the more complete inhibition of the system. Most published trials, including recent large studies and meta-analyses, have reported either limited or no additional benefit. Dual-blockade therapy seems to have some benefit on proteinuria and blood pressure reduction, and on morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure, compared with monotherapy. The major issue arising from these published trials and meta-analyses is the increased frequency of dual therapy discontinuation and adverse effects on kidney function. There is a lack of hard end-point data for renal outcomes and long-term safety data in most published trials. Until the results of ongoing trials become available and as further safety data emerge, a wise approach would be to withhold use of ACE inhibitor and ARB combination therapy in general practice. When used in selected conditions, patients need to be closely monitored.

Abbreviations: RASi, renin angiotensin system inhibitor; ACEi, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors; ARBs, angiotensin receptor blockers; eGFR, estimated glomerular filtration rate; AKI, acute kidney injury.

We used a 1-year period before the index date as the baseline period for definition of baseline covariates. The follow-up period started at 6 months after the index date and ended at the earliest date of outcomes of interest or censor date (December 31, 2019). We excluded patients enrolled in 2000–2001 to avoid bias from incomplete case records in the first two years of establishment of the HA EMR system, and identified 132, 280 patients who were initiated on RASi (ACEi/ARBs) in the RAMP-DM module in 2002–2019. We excluded patients with eGFR ≥ 30 ml/min/1.73 m² (n = 116,099) throughout the observation period and those who had already stopped RASi prior to reaching eGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m² (n = 6396). We also excluded those who were initiated on RASi in 2019, with RASi exposure < 90 days during the observation period and follow-up < 6 months. This yielded 10,400 patients with T2D in the main analysis (Fig. 2). In further subgroups analyses, we compared the effects of those who subsequently re-initiated RASi after initial discontinuation in the first 6 months of the index date (stop-restart RASi) and those who permanently discontinued-RASi (stopping within 6 months and never re-initiate).

### KDOQI US commentary on the KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of CKD [^115fycFW]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Renin–angiotensin system inhibitor therapy in chronic kidney disease — practice points are as follows: Hyperkalemia associated with use of RASi can often be managed by measures to reduce the serum potassium levels rather than decreasing the dose or stopping RASi. Continue ACEi or ARB therapy unless serum creatinine rises by more than 30% within 4 weeks following initiation of treatment or an increase in dose. Consider reducing the dose or discontinuing ACEi or ARB in the setting of either symptomatic hypotension or uncontrolled hyperkalemia despite medical treatment, or to reduce uremic symptoms while treating kidney failure (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] < 15 ml/min per 1.73 m²). Consider starting people with CKD with normal to mildly increased albuminuria (A1) on RASi (ACEi or ARB) for specific indications (e.g., to treat hypertension or heart failure with low ejection fraction). Continue ACEi or ARB in people with CKD even when the eGFR falls below 30 ml/min per 1.73 m².

### Clinical implications of estimated glomerular filtration rate dip following sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor initiation on cardiovascular and kidney outcomes [^111qhQnW]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Our analyses of factors associated with eGFR discontinuation suggest that the occurrence of adverse events, hospitalization, or increase in HbA1c (a marker of worsening glycemic control) was associated with discontinuation of SGLT2i. Furthermore, eGFR dip > 30% was also associated with increased risk of discontinuation. These results may be useful in guiding efforts to examine whether some of these patient groups may benefit from resumption of treatment with SGLT2i.

The mechanism underpinning the eGFR dip in SGLT2i is not entirely clear. It has been suggested that this initial dip is reminiscent of the mild decline in eGFR observed in some patients following initiation of angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker, which is generally attributed to postglomerular (efferent) vasodilatation and reduced hyperfiltration. Several other hypotheses are being tested, including potential contribution of enhanced proximal tubular natriuresis leading to activation of tubuloglomerular feedback and resultant preglomerular (afferent) vasoconstriction. The constellation of evidence from randomized controlled trials and real‐world studies suggests that the initial eGFR dip is likely a functional (and reversible) dip that does not reflect kidney injury and is then followed by eGFR stabilization, and ultimately reduced risk of adverse cardiovascular and kidney outcomes. The results of our analyses are congruent with this understanding and support the assessment that eGFR dip does not substantially erode the effectiveness of SGLT2i on cardiovascular and kidney outcomes, and that even in those with eGFR dip > 30%, continued therapy with SGLT2i was more beneficial for longer‐term cardiovascular and kidney outcomes than discontinued therapy.

### A meta-analysis of randomized controlled clinical trials for implications of acute treatment effects on glomerular filtration rate for long-term kidney protection [^115FeScN]. Kidney International (2024). Medium credibility.

Pharmacologic interventions to slow chronic kidney disease progression, such as ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, or sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors, often produce acute treatment effects on glomerular filtration rate (GFR) that differ from their long-term chronic treatment effects. Observational studies assessing the implications of acute effects cannot distinguish acute effects from GFR changes unrelated to the treatment. Here, we performed meta-regression analysis of multiple trials to isolate acute effects to determine their long-term implications. In 64 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), enrolling 154,045 participants, we estimated acute effects as the mean between-group difference in GFR slope from baseline to three months, effects on chronic GFR slope (starting at three months after randomization), and effects on three composite kidney endpoints defined by kidney failure (GFR 15 ml/min/1.73 m² or less, chronic dialysis, or kidney transplantation) or sustained GFR declines of 30%, 40% or 57% decline, respectively. We used Bayesian meta-regression to relate acute effects with treatment effects on chronic slope and the composite kidney endpoints. Overall, acute effects were not associated with treatment effects on chronic slope. Acute effects were associated with the treatment effects on composite kidney outcomes such that larger negative acute effects were associated with lesser beneficial effects on the composite kidney endpoints. Associations were stronger when the kidney composite endpoints were defined by smaller thresholds of GFR decline (30% or 40%). Results were similar in a subgroup of interventions with supposedly hemodynamic effects that acutely reduce GFR. For studies with GFR 60 mL/min/1.73 m² or under, negative acute effects were associated with larger beneficial effects on chronic GFR slope. Thus, our data from a large and diverse set of RCTs suggests that acute effects of interventions may influence the treatment effect on clinical kidney outcomes.

### Evidence-based medical therapy in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and chronic kidney disease [^114xVJo6]. Circulation (2022). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) as identified by a reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is a common comorbidity in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). The presence of CKD is associated with more severe heart failure, and CKD itself is a strong independent risk factor of poor cardiovascular outcome. Furthermore, the presence of CKD often influences the decision to start, uptitrate, or discontinue possible life-saving HFrEF therapies. Because pivotal HFrEF randomized clinical trials have historically excluded patients with stage 4 and 5 CKD (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2), information on the efficacy and tolerability of HFrEF therapies in these patients is limited. However, more recent HFrEF trials with novel classes of drugs included patients with more severe CKD. In this review on medical therapy in patients with HFrEF and CKD, we show that for both all-cause mortality and the combined end point of cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization, most drug classes are safe and effective up to CKD stage 3B (eGFR minimum 30 mL/min/1.73 m²). For more severe CKD (stage 4), there is evidence of safety and efficacy of sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, and to a lesser extent, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, vericiguat, digoxin and omecamtiv mecarbil, although this evidence is restricted to improvement of cardiovascular death/heart failure hospitalization. Data are lacking on the safety and efficacy for any HFrEF therapies in CKD stage 5 (eGFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m 2 or dialysis) for either end point. Last, although an initial decline in eGFR is observed on initiation of several HFrEF drug classes (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers/mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists/angiotensin receptor blocker neprilysin inhibitors/sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors), renal function often stabilizes over time, and the drugs maintain their clinical efficacy. A decline in eGFR in the context of a stable or improving clinical condition should therefore not be cause for concern and should not lead to discontinuation of life-saving HFrEF therapies.

### Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers for adults with early (stage 1 to 3) non-diabetic chronic kidney disease [^112i7NXE]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a long term condition that occurs as a result of damage to the kidneys. Early recognition of CKD is becoming increasingly common due to widespread laboratory estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) reporting, raised clinical awareness, and international adoption of Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (K/DOQI) classification. Early recognition and management of CKD affords the opportunity not only to prepare for progressive kidney impairment and impending renal replacement therapy, but also for intervening to reduce the risk of progression and cardiovascular disease. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) are two classes of antihypertensive drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Beneficial effects of ACEi and ARB on renal outcomes and survival in people with a wide range of severity of renal impairment have been reported; however, their effectiveness in the subgroup of people with early CKD (stage 1 to 3) is less certain.

Objectives

This review aimed to evaluate the benefits and harms of ACEi and ARB or both in the management of people with early (stage 1 to 3) CKD who do not have diabetes mellitus.

Search Strategy

In March 2010 we searched The Cochrane Library, including The Cochrane Renal Group's specialised register and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE. Reference lists of review articles and relevant studies were also checked. The search was conducted using the optimally sensitive strategy developed by the Cochrane Collaboration for the identification of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with input from an expert in trial search strategy.

Selection Criteria

All RCTs reporting the effect of ACEi or ARB in people with early (stage 1 to 3) CKD who did not have diabetes mellitus were selected for inclusion. Only studies of at least four weeks duration were selected. Authors, working in teams of two, independently assessed the retrieved titles and abstracts, and whenever necessary the full text of these studies were screened to determine which studies satisfied the inclusion criteria.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data extraction was carried out by two authors, independently, using a standard data extraction form and cross checked by two other authors. Methodological quality of included studies was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Data entry was carried out by one author and cross checked by another author. When more than one study reported similar outcomes, data were pooled using the random-effects model, but a fixed-effect model was also analysed to ensure the robustness of the model chosen and to check susceptibility to outliers. Heterogeneity was analysed using a Chi² test on N-1 degrees of freedom, with an alpha of 0.05 used for statistical significance and with the I² test. Where data permitted, subgroup analysis was used to explore possible sources of heterogeneity. The quality of the evidence was analysed.

Main Results

Four RCTs enrolling 2177 participants met our inclusion criteria. Of these, three compared ACEi with placebo and one compared ACEi with ARB. Two studies had an overall low risk of bias, and the other two were considered to be at moderate to high risk of bias. Low to moderate quality of evidence (from two studies representing 1906 patients) suggested that ACEi had no impact on all-cause mortality (RR 1.80, 95% CI 0.17 to 19.27, P = 0.63) or cardiovascular events (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.14, P = 0.31) in people with stage 3 CKD. For all-cause mortality, there was substantial heterogeneity in the results. One study (quality assessment: low risk of bias) reported no difference in the risk of end-stage kidney disease in those with an eGFR > 45 mL/min/1.74 m² treated with ACEi versus placebo (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.11, P = 0.99). The (high risk of bias) study that compared ACEi with ARB reported little difference in effect between the treatments when urinary protein, blood pressure or creatinine clearance were compared. No published studies comparing ARB with placebo or ACEi and ARB with placebo were identified.

Authors' Conclusions

Our review demonstrated that there is currently insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of ACEi or ARB in patients with stage 1 to 3 CKD who do not have diabetes mellitus. We have identified an area of significant uncertainty for a group of patients who account for most of those labelled as having CKD.

### Kidney disease in type 2 diabetes mellitus and benefits of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors: a consensus statement [^1112dVvq]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Overall, genital mycotic infections are the most frequent side effect observed with SGLT2i. The incidence of UTI in patients treated with SGLT2i is similar to that seen in all people with T2DM. Hypoglycemia can occur when a SGLT2i is used as an add-on to other agents causing hypoglycemia, such as insulin or sulfonylureas. Volume depletion and hypotension are rare and can be minimized by adjusting diuretic and antihypertensive treatment in patients at risk. The incidences of AKI, amputation (largely feet and toes), and fractures are rare and can be prevented by careful monitoring and avoiding use in high-risk patients.

Ongoing SGLT2i Trials Assessing Renal Outcomes

Multiple trials assessing the renal benefits of SGLT2i are ongoing. The RACELINES trial will assess the clinical effects and mechanism of monotherapy and combination therapy of the SGLT2i empagliflozin and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitor linagliptin on renal physiology and biomarkers in metformin-treated T2DM patients. The EMPA-KIDNEY trial will compare the renal effect of a SGLT2i and a sulfonylurea. The EMPA-KIDNEY trial will evaluate the effect of empagliflozin on kidney disease progression or CV death in people without T2DM. Despite optimal treatment with RAAS inhibitors, many patients with non-diabetic kidney disease show progressive kidney function loss, which is associated with high residual proteinuria. The recently completed DIAMOND study was conducted to assess the renoprotective effects of dapagliflozin in non-diabetic patients with proteinuria. The DAPA-CKD trial, evaluating the efficacy of dapagliflozin in patients with CKD stages 2–4 and elevated urinary albumin excretion, with and without T2D, will be stopped early due to overwhelming efficacy. The treatment paradigm for CKD, for people with and without T2DM, may change after the release of the ongoing trial results over the next few years. These trials are listed in Table 4 with their primary outcome measures.

### Comparative effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers on blood pressure and the kidney [^115FpGnT]. The American Journal of Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Many clinicians are uncomfortable about using angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (AT(1)-blockers) to treat patients with renal disease because of concerns about increasing serum creatinine levels. However, the benefits of these medications, particularly their efficacy in slowing the progression of renal disease, outweigh such concerns. ACE inhibitors are effective in patients with type 1 diabetes and renal disease, as well as in those with nondiabetic renal disease and proteinuria > 0.5 g/d. AT(1)-blockers slow the progression of diabetic nephropathy in patients with type 2 diabetes. Although these classes of medications should not be used in patients with severe renal insufficiency (e.g., glomerular filtration rate < 20 mL/min), they may be beneficial in patients with mild-to-moderate renal insufficiency. Nonetheless, caution should be exercised in those with a glomerular filtration rate < 30 mL/min, and serum creatinine and potassium levels should be checked approximately 1 week after starting treatment. There is also evidence suggesting that these medications lead to greater reductions in blood pressure and proteinuria when used in combination than when alone. The purpose of this paper is to review the mechanisms of action of these two classes of medication, as well as the experimental and clinical evidence that they slow the progression of renal disease.

### Effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers on cardiovascular events and residual renal function in dialysis patients: a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^113MdVQp]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Cardiovascular events (CVEs) are the leading causes of death among dialysis patients, with mortality rates 7 to 30 times higher than in the general population. Observational studies to date in dialysis patients have reported an association between progressive loss of residual glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and increased mortality; Causality has not been established with dialysis patient survival and residual renal function (RRF). Treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) has provided significant cardiovascular protection and preserved RRF for chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Unfortunately, most trials excluded patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) receiving maintenance dialysis, the beneficial effects of ACEI/ARBs on CVEs and RRF in dialysis patients remain uncertain. Some large-scale trials tested the effects of ACEIs/ARBs therapy in dialysis patients provided inconsistent results, and much uncertainty persists regarding the protective effects of this agent.

We therefore undertook a meta-analysis to evaluate the effect of ACEIs and ARBs on cardiovascular events and residual renal function decline in patients receiving dialysis.

### Multicentre randomized controlled trial of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor / angiotensin receptor blocker withdrawal in advanced renal disease: the STOP-ACEi trial [^1172zpTW]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2016). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Chronic kidney disease (CKD), Stages 3–5, affects 1 in 10 adults in the UK and reflects progressive scarring of the kidneys regardless of the original disease and is associated with a high prevalence of cardiovascular disease. Advanced CKD (Stage 4 or 5) is associated with a significantly increased risk of death [hazard ratio (HR): 3.6; 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.2–4.0] and a 50-fold increased requirement for dialysis, in comparison with age-matched individuals with presumed normal kidney function. Advanced CKD has a major negative impact on a range of other clinical outcomes including quality of life and carries a high economic burden either through associated cardiovascular or metabolic bone disease or due to the high cost of renal dialysis (∼£30 000/year).

### Use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in patients with heart failure and renal insufficiency: how concerned should we be by the rise in serum creatinine? [^1161tg2e]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

To determine the association between the early rise in serum creatinine levels associated with the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and the long-term renoprotective properties of these drugs in patients with chronic renal insufficiency.

Background

Large-scale clinical trials have demonstrated survival benefits of ACE inhibitors in patients with heart failure. In patients with renal insufficiency, whether associated with diabetes mellitus or not, use of ACE inhibitors is associated with slowing in the progression of renal disease. In fact, patients who have the most advanced renal insufficiency at baseline are the ones who show the maximum slowing of the disease progression, but these patients are also more likely to show an early rise in serum creatinine levels after ACE inhibitor therapy. There is evidence that patients with renal insufficiency often do not receive ACE inhibitors. There is also evidence that patients with heart failure are not receiving this life-saving drug or are receiving it at dosages lower than that used in the clinical trials. One of the main reasons for this underutilization of ACE inhibitors in patients with heart failure is the underlying renal insufficiency or the rise in serum creatinine level after initiation of therapy with an ACE inhibitor.

Methods

The authors reviewed 12 randomized clinical trials of ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy in patients with preexisting chronic renal insufficiency, with or without diabetes mellitus or heart failure. Studies were included for review if they met the following criteria: subjects were randomized to receive ACE inhibitor; subjects were followed up for a minimum of 2 years; and most of the subjects had baseline chronic renal insufficiency (≥ 25% loss of renal function), irrespective of cause. Of the 12 studies that met these criteria, six were multicenter double-blind placebo-controlled studies. The other six were smaller randomized studies. The studies had a mean ± standard deviation follow-up of 3.2 ± 0.3 years. One thousand one hundred two patients were randomized to receive ACE inhibitors or ARBs. Of these, 705 (64%) had data on renal function at baseline (within 6 months of the start) and at the end of the study. The authors examined the changes in serum creatinine levels or glomerular filtration rates (GFR) in patients who were randomized to receive ACE inhibitors. The authors also assessed the blood pressures achieved in the trials.

Results

Patients with preexisting chronic renal insufficiency who achieved their blood pressure control goals were likely to demonstrate an early rise in serum creatinine levels, approximately 25% above the baseline (approximately 1.7 mg/dL) after initiation of ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy. This rise in serum creatinine was more acute (by approximately 15% from the baseline) during the first 2 weeks of therapy and was more gradual (additional approximately 10%) during the third and fourth weeks of therapy (Figure 1). The serum creatinine level was likely to stabilize after about 4 weeks, provided patients had a normal salt and fluid intake. In addition, patients who did not show a rise in serum creatinine level during the first 2 to 4 weeks of therapy, were less likely to experience one after that period, unless they were dehydrated from use of diuretics or gastroenteritis or had used a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID). In spite of this early rise in serum creatinine in patients with chronic renal insufficiency (a serum creatinine level of ≥ 124 micromol/L or ≥ 1.4 mg/dL) who were randomized to receive an ACE inhibitor, these patients receiving the drug showed a 55% to 75% lower risk of worsening renal function than those with normal renal function receiving the drug. The rate of risk reduction was inversely related to the severity of renal impairment at baseline, but data were limited on the benefit of ACE inhibitors in patients with more advanced renal insufficiency (GFR < 30 mL/min). The authors noted that those aged 65 and older were likely to have much lower GFRs for given levels of serum creatinine than younger patients and were therefore likely to have advanced renal insufficiency at serum creatinine levels as low as 2 mg/dL (vs 4 mg/dL for younger patients). Patients with normal renal function were likely to show a much smaller rise in serum creatinine level (approximately 10% above the baseline of 0.9 mg/dL), mostly occurring during the first week after initiation of therapy, with subsequent stabilization, whereas patients with normal renal function suffering from heart failure, volume depletion, or bilateral renal artery stenosis experienced a significant rise (approximately 225% above baseline) in serum creatinine level, much higher in magnitude and rate than that experienced by those with renal insufficiency (Figure 1). Serum creatinine levels in these patients sharply increased (by approximately 75% above baseline) in the 2 weeks after the initiation of therapy with an ACE inhibitor, followed by an even sharper increase (another approximately 150%) during the subsequent 2 weeks. Patients with chronic renal insufficiency (serum creatinine > 1.5 mg/dL) who received therapy with ACE inhibitors had about a five times higher risk of developing hyperkalemia than those with normal renal function, whereas presence of heart failure increased the risk of hyperkalemia by about three times over those without heart failure. Concomitant use of diuretics was associated with an approximately 60% reduction in risk of hyperkalemia.

Conclusion

The authors conclude that, in patients with renal insufficiency (serum creatinine > 1.4 mg/dL) treated with ACE inhibitors, there is a strong association between early (within the first 2 months) and moderate (not exceeding 30% over baseline) rise in serum creatinine and slowing of the renal disease progression in the long run. The authors recommend that ACE inhibitor therapy should not be discontinued unless serum creatinine level rise above 30% over baseline during the first 2 months after initiation of therapy or hyperkalemia (serum potassium level ≥ 5.6 mmol/L) develops.

### The aliskiren trial to minimize outcomeS in patients with HEart failure trial (ATMOSPHERE): revised statistical analysis plan and baseline characteristics [^1123abmR]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2015). Low credibility.

Aims and Methods

To: (i) describe the baseline characteristics of patients in ATMOSPHERE and the changes in the planned analysis of ATMOSPHERE resulting from the mandated discontinuation of study treatment in patients with diabetes; (ii) compare the baseline characteristics of patients in ATMOSPHERE with those in the Prospective comparison of Angiotensin Receptor neprilysin inhibitors with Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors to Determine Impact on Global Mortality and morbidity in Heart Failure trial (PARADIGM-HF); and (iii) compare the characteristics of patients with and without diabetes at baseline in ATMOSPHERE.

Results

A total of 7063 patients were randomized into ATMOSPHERE April 2009-April 2014 at 755 sites in 43 countries. Their average age was 63 years and 78% were men. ATMOSPHERE patients were generally similar to those in PARADIGM-HF although fewer had diabetes, renal dysfunction, and were treated with a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist. In ATMOSPHERE, patients with diabetes differed in numerous ways from those without. Patients with diabetes were older and had worse heart failure status but a similar left ventricular ejection fraction (mean 28%); they had a higher body mass index and more co-morbidity, especially hypertension and coronary heart disease. Mean estimated glomerular filtration rate was slightly lower in those with diabetes compared with those without.

Conclusion

ATMOSPHERE will determine whether patients with HF and reduced ejection fraction (particularly those without diabetes) benefit from the addition of a direct renin inhibitor to standard background therapy, including an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, beta-blocker, and a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist. ATMOSPHERE will also determine whether aliskiren alone is superior to, or at least non-inferior to, enalapril.

### Common questions about the initial management of hypertension [^115w1TWQ]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Hypertension is the most common chronic condition treated by family physicians. Elevated blood pressure is associated with an increased risk of heart failure, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular disease, and death. Treatment of hypertension reduces the risk of these events. Several lifestyle modifications are associated with improvements in blood pressure, including the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet, sodium restriction, regular exercise, and moderate weight loss. There is strong evidence that reducing diastolic blood pressure to less than 90 mm Hg is beneficial in adults older than 30 years. Although there is good evidence to support reducing systolic blood pressure to less than 150 mm Hg in adults older than 60 years, the evidence in younger adults is insufficient to recommend a specific goal. Black patients with chronic kidney disease who are treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker to a blood pressure of less than 140/90 mm Hg experience slower declines in glomerular filtration rates than patients treated with other medications. A blood pressure goal of less than 140/90 mm Hg is recommended in patients with chronic kidney disease and in those with diabetes mellitus. Thiazide diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and calcium channel blockers are the preferred medications in nonblack patients; thiazide diuretics and calcium channel blockers are preferred in black patients.

Aldosterone antagonist therapy — hyperkalemia risk minimization: Impaired renal function is a risk factor for hyperkalemia during treatment with aldosterone antagonists, and risk increases when serum creatinine exceeds 1.6 mg per dL; in patients in whom creatinine may not reflect filtration, determination that glomerular filtration rate or creatinine clearance exceeds 30 mL per min is recommended. Aldosterone antagonists should not be administered to patients with baseline serum potassium in excess of 5.0 mEq per liter. An initial dose of spironolactone 12.5 mg or eplerenone 25 mg is recommended, with possible increase to spironolactone 25 mg or eplerenone 50 mg as appropriate. The risk of hyperkalemia is increased with concomitant higher doses of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) (captopril greater than or equal to 75 mg daily; enalapril or lisinopril greater than or equal to 10 mg daily); nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitors should be avoided, and potassium supplements should be discontinued or reduced. Close monitoring is required: potassium levels and renal function should be checked in 3 days and at 1 week after initiation of therapy and at least monthly for the first 3 months, and diarrhea or other causes of dehydration should be addressed emergently. Although trial entry allowed creatinine greater than 2.5 mg per dL, in 1 trial 95% of patients had creatinine less than or equal to 1.7 mg per dL, indicating most studied patients had better renal function than the entry limit.

Background

One of the great triumphs of modern medicine is the therapy of patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) due to reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (HFrEF). Treatment with ACE inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), sacubitril/valsartan, beta-blockers and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) (together with appropriate device therapy) increase life expectancy markedly, with the combination of sacubitril/valsartan, beta-blocker and MRA reducing all-cause mortality with a HR of 0.37 against placebo. However, there is frequently a conflict between renal function and heart failure therapy. Renal dysfunction is extremely common in patients with CHF (figure 1) and associated with a worse outcome. Most of the treatments used for CHF can cause worsening renal function.

AKI, acute kidney injury; CKD, chronic kidney disease; HFREF, heart failure with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction; MI, myocardial infarction; RAAS, renin–angiotensin–aldosterone.

Anxiety about rises in creatinine (and the associated falls in estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]) can lead to underprescription of ACEI and ARBs. The tendency to withdraw ACEI and ARB has been exacerbated by the international adoption of the term 'acute kidney injury' (AKI) to describe acute changes in kidney functionand by the inclusion of these drugs, which can also protect against progressive proteinuric kidney damage, in lists of drugs termed 'nephrotoxic'. The British National Formulary and guidelines on chronic kidney disease (CKD) published by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)advise dose reduction or even stopping ACEI or ARB if serum creatinine rises by > 30% without another explanation. The NICE heart failure guidelinerecommends regular biochemical monitoring but refers to the NICE CKD guidelines on how to respond to changes in biochemistry. In contrast, the European Society of Cardiology heart failure guidelines advise dose reduction or withdrawal only if serum creatinine rises by > 50% or reaches a limit of 266 μmol/L.(The arbitrary nature of some cut points is shown by the peculiar numbers that sometimes appear. They appear less peculiar when it is appreciated that they are conversions of round numbers of mg/dL.)

### Multicentre randomized controlled trial of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor / angiotensin receptor blocker withdrawal in advanced renal disease: the STOP-ACEi trial [^115uQeEq]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2016). Low credibility.

Irrespective of the underlying cause of CKD, attention has focused primarily on blood pressure (BP) control and reduction of urinary protein excretion using agents that block the renin–angiotensin aldosterone system and reduce intra-glomerular pressure over and above their effect on BP. Studies by Lewis et al. and Brenner et al. have shown that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) reduce the progression of renal disease. Data from the HOPE, LIFE and ALLHAT studies have confirmed the benefit of ACEi use in mild CKD [estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) > 60 mL/min/1.73m 2 with proteinuria or structural defects].

Few studies have included patients with advanced CKD at baseline. Moreover, it is difficult to dissociate the beneficial effect of ACEi from BP control. Indeed, in the HOPE sub-study using 24-h ambulatory BP in place of office BP, there was a significant reduction in BP from baseline in patients assigned to ramipril, which may have been an important mediator of benefit. Ruggenenti et al. in a post hoc analysis of 322 patients suggested that therapy should be offered to all patients with CKD, even those with a GFR between 10 and 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2. In this seminal study, there was no 'nephroprotective' effect when baseline proteinuria was < 1.5 g/24 h, suggesting that the beneficial effects of ACEi may be limited to those with 'pure' glomerular disease rather than those with low-level proteinuria who may have ischaemic CKD. A Cochrane review of 49 studies containing 12 067 diabetic patients at all stages of CKD found that ACEi and ARBs improved hard end point [end-stage renal disease (ESRD)] and other outcomes, and appeared to reduce mortality (relative risk 0.78; 95% CI 0.61–0.98). The authors, however, cautioned against the conclusion that ACEi prevents progression of CKD, suggesting that any initial benefit may be due to their anti-proteinuric effects (probably reflecting better overall BP control), that there was little robust evidence of benefit in advanced CKD and that conclusions were based mainly on composite end points.

### Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system: the ultimate treatment for renal protection? [^113g4qSq]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2005). Low credibility.

The prevalence of chronic renal diseases is increasing worldwide. There is a great need to identify therapies that arrest disease progression to end-stage renal failure. Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system both by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists is probably the best therapeutic option available. Several large, multicenter studies have indeed shown a significant reduction in the risk for doubling baseline serum creatinine or progression toward end-stage renal failure in patients who do and do not have diabetes and have chronic nephropathies that are treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor antagonists. However, the number of patients who reach end-stage renal failure is still considerably high. Significant reduction of the incidence of ESRD is likely to be achieved in the near future for chronic nephropathies, provided that the degree of renoprotection can be improved. This goal may be attainable with a more complex strategy than with a single or dual pharmacologic intervention on the renin-angiotensin system. Strict control of BP and protein excretion rate, lowering of blood lipids, tight glucose control for individuals with diabetes, and lifestyle changes form part of the future multimodal protocol for treatment of patients with chronic nephropathies.

### Acute fall in glomerular filtration rate with renin-angiotensin system inhibition: a biomeasure of therapeutic success? [^114Eitoo]. Kidney International (2011). Low credibility.

Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) acutely declines with the introduction of renin-angiotensin system inhibition. This response is functional, not anatomical, and varies with volume status. The reduction in GFR with renin-angiotensin system inhibition may serve as a biomeasure of future therapeutic benefit.

### Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers for adults with early (stage 1 to 3) non-diabetic chronic kidney disease [^116uCvV1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a long-term condition that occurs as a result of damage to the kidneys. Early recognition of CKD is becoming increasingly common due to widespread laboratory estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) reporting, raised clinical awareness, and international adoption of the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) classifications. Early recognition and management of CKD affords the opportunity to prepare for progressive kidney impairment and impending kidney replacement therapy and for intervention to reduce the risk of progression and cardiovascular disease. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) are two classes of antihypertensive drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Beneficial effects of ACEi and ARB on kidney outcomes and survival in people with a wide range of severity of kidney impairment have been reported; however, their effectiveness in the subgroup of people with early CKD (stage 1 to 3) is less certain. This is an update of a review that was last published in 2011.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of ACEi and ARB or both in the management of people with early (stage 1 to 3) CKD who do not have diabetes mellitus (DM).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 6 July 2023 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) reporting the effect of ACEi or ARB in people with early (stage 1 to 3) CKD who did not have DM were selected for inclusion. Only studies of at least four weeks duration were selected. Authors independently assessed the retrieved titles and abstracts and, where necessary, the full text to determine which satisfied the inclusion criteria.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data extraction was carried out by two authors independently, using a standard data extraction form. The methodological quality of included studies was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Data entry was carried out by one author and cross-checked by another. When more than one study reported similar outcomes, data were pooled using the random-effects model. Heterogeneity was analysed using a Chi² test and the I² test. Results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) and 95% CI for continuous outcomes. Confidence in the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach MAIN RESULTS: Six studies randomising 9379 participants with CKD stages 1 to 3 (without DM) met our inclusion criteria. Participants were adults with hypertension; 79% were male from China, Europe, Japan, and the USA. Treatment periods ranged from 12 weeks to three years. Overall, studies were judged to be at unclear or high risk of bias across all domains, and the quality of the evidence was poor, with GRADE rated as low or very low certainty. In low certainty evidence, ACEi (benazepril 10 mg or trandolapril 2 mg) compared to placebo may make little or no difference to death (any cause) (2 studies, 8873 participants): RR 2.00, 95% CI 0.26 to 15.37; I² = 76%), total cardiovascular events (2 studies, 8873 participants): RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.05; I² = 0%), cardiovascular-related death (2 studies, 8873 participants): RR 1.73, 95% CI 0.26 to 11.66; I² = 54%), stroke (2 studies, 8873 participants): RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.03; I² = 0%), myocardial infarction (2 studies, 8873 participants): RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.20; I² = 0%), and adverse events (2 studies, 8873 participants): RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.26 to 1.41; I² = 0%). It is uncertain whether ACEi (benazepril 10 mg or trandolapril 2 mg) compared to placebo reduces congestive heart failure (1 study, 8290 participants): RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.95) or transient ischaemic attack (1 study, 583 participants): RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.06 to 15.01; I² = 0%) because the certainty of the evidence is very low. It is uncertain whether ARB (losartan 50 mg) compared to placebo (1 study, 226 participants) reduces: death (any-cause) (no events), adverse events (RR 19.34, 95% CI 1.14 to 328.30), eGFR rate of decline (MD 5.00 mL/min/1.73 m 2, 95% CI 3.03 to 6.97), presence of proteinuria (MD -0.65 g/24 hours, 95% CI -0.78 to -0.52), systolic blood pressure (MD -0.80 mm Hg, 95% CI -3.89 to 2.29), or diastolic blood pressure (MD -1.10 mm Hg, 95% CI -3.29 to 1.09) because the certainty of the evidence is very low. It is uncertain whether ACEi (enalapril 20 mg, perindopril 2 mg or trandolapril 1 mg) compared to ARB (olmesartan 20 mg, losartan 25 mg or candesartan 4 mg) (1 study, 26 participants) reduces: proteinuria (MD -0.40, 95% CI -0.60 to -0.20), systolic blood pressure (MD -3.00 mm Hg, 95% CI -6.08 to 0.08) or diastolic blood pressure (MD -1.00 mm Hg, 95% CI -3.31 to 1.31) because the certainty of the evidence is very low.

Authors' Conclusions

There is currently insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of ACEi or ARB in patients with stage 1 to 3 CKD who do not have DM. The available evidence is overall of very low certainty and high risk of bias. We have identified an area of large uncertainty for a group of patients who account for most of those diagnosed as having CKD.

### Slowing nephropathy progression: focus on proteinuria reduction [^117JryXP]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

Blood pressure control reduces decline of kidney function. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers offer renoprotection to a small extent beyond that attributable to blood pressure lowering. These agents also reduce proteinuria, a risk marker for renal disease progression. Accumulating evidence indicates that their antiproteinuric effect correlates with their additional renal benefits.

### Angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers for preventing the progression of diabetic kidney disease [^113uVeP1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Guidelines suggest that adults with diabetes and kidney disease receive treatment with angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB). This is an update of a Cochrane review published in 2006.

Objectives

We compared the efficacy and safety of ACEi and ARB therapy (either as monotherapy or in combination) on cardiovascular and kidney outcomes in adults with diabetes and kidney disease.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplants Register of Studies to 17 March 2024 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

We included studies evaluating ACEi or ARB alone or in combination, compared to each other, placebo or no treatment in people with diabetes and kidney disease.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias and extracted data. Summary estimates of effect were obtained using a random-effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) and 95% CI for continuous outcomes. Confidence in the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

Main Results

One hundred and nine studies (28,341 randomised participants) were eligible for inclusion. Overall, the risk of bias was high. Compared to placebo or no treatment, ACEi may make little or no difference to all-cause death (24 studies, 7413 participants: RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.15; I² = 23%; low certainty) and with similar withdrawals from treatment (7 studies, 5306 participants: RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.19; I² = 0%; low certainty). ACEi may prevent kidney failure (8 studies, 6643 participants: RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.94; I² = 0%; low certainty). Compared to placebo or no treatment, ARB may make little or no difference to all-cause death (11 studies, 4260 participants: RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.16; I² = 0%; low certainty). ARB have uncertain effects on withdrawal from treatment (3 studies, 721 participants: RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.26; I² = 2%; low certainty) and cardiovascular death (6 studies, 878 participants: RR 3.36, 95% CI 0.93 to 12.07; low certainty). ARB may prevent kidney failure (3 studies, 3227 participants: RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.94; I² = 0%; low certainty), doubling of serum creatinine (SCr) (4 studies, 3280 participants: RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.97; I² = 32%; low certainty), and the progression from microalbuminuria to macroalbuminuria (5 studies, 815 participants: RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.85; I² = 74%; low certainty). Compared to ACEi, ARB had uncertain effects on all-cause death (15 studies, 1739 participants: RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.88; I² = 0%; low certainty), withdrawal from treatment (6 studies, 612 participants: RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.28; I² = 0%; low certainty), cardiovascular death (13 studies, 1606 participants: RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.45 to 2.98; I² = 0%; low certainty), kidney failure (3 studies, 837 participants: RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.07; I² = 0%; low certainty), and doubling of SCr (2 studies, 767 participants: RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.48; I² = 0%; low certainty). Compared to ACEi plus ARB, ACEi alone has uncertain effects on all-cause death (6 studies, 1166 participants: RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.49 to 2.40; I² = 20%; low certainty), withdrawal from treatment (2 studies, 172 participants: RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.86; I² = 0%; low certainty), cardiovascular death (4 studies, 994 participants: RR 3.02, 95% CI 0.61 to 14.85; low certainty), kidney failure (3 studies, 880 participants: RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.79 to 2.32; I² = 0%; low certainty), and doubling of SCr (2 studies, 813 participants: RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.85; I² = 0%; low certainty). Compared to ACEi plus ARB, ARB alone has uncertain effects on all-cause death (7 studies, 2607 participants: RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.37; I² = 0%; low certainty), withdrawn from treatment (3 studies, 1615 participants: RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.24; I² = 0%; low certainty), cardiovascular death (4 studies, 992 participants: RR 3.03, 95% CI 0.62 to 14.93; low certainty), kidney failure (4 studies, 2321 participants: RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.95; I² = 29%; low certainty), and doubling of SCr (3 studies, 2252 participants: RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.64; I² = 0%; low certainty). Comparative effects of different ACEi or ARB and low-dose versus high-dose ARB were rarely evaluated. No study compared different doses of ACEi. Adverse events of ACEi and ARB were rarely reported.

Authors' Conclusions

ACEi or ARB may make little or no difference to all-cause and cardiovascular death compared to placebo or no treatment in people with diabetes and kidney disease but may prevent kidney failure. ARB may prevent the doubling of SCr and the progression from microalbuminuria to macroalbuminuria compared with a placebo or no treatment. Despite the international guidelines suggesting not combining ACEi and ARB treatment, the effects of ACEi or ARB monotherapy compared to dual therapy have not been adequately assessed. The limited data availability and the low quality of the included studies prevented the assessment of the benefits and harms of ACEi or ARB in people with diabetes and kidney disease. Low and very low certainty evidence indicates that it is possible that further studies might provide different results.

### Multicentre randomized controlled trial of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor / angiotensin receptor blocker withdrawal in advanced renal disease: the STOP-ACEi trial [^1177Gtno]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2016). Low credibility.

Study enrolment and randomization

Following informed consent and completion of the baseline assessments, participants will be randomized into the trial in a 1∶1 ratio to either continue with their ACEi and/or ARB treatment (control arm) or to discontinue their ACEi and/or ARB treatment (experimental arm). Randomization will be provided by a computer-generated programme at the Clinical Trials Unit, using a minimization algorithm to ensure balance between the arms with regard to important clinical variables. The minimization variables will be diabetes (Type I diabetes, Type II diabetes or non-diabetic), BP {mean arterial pressure [MAP] measured as [(2 × diastolic + systolic)/3]; < 100 or ≥ 100}, age (< 65 or ≥ 65 years), proteinuria (protein:creatinine ratio (PCR) < 100 or ≥ 100) and eGFR (< 15 or ≥ 15 mL/min).

Study treatment

Active treatment (experimental)

All ACEi and/or ARB treatment will be discontinued. In order to compensate for the loss of antihypertensive activity, additional antihypertensive treatment will be commenced to keep BP within recommended guidelines. Any antihypertensive agents used in routine clinical practice are permitted to control BP throughout the trial, but excluding ACEi or ARBs. The choice of antihypertensive will depend on other treatment being taken by the participant and will be at the discretion of the responsible clinician. Any antihypertensive agent used in routine clinical practice is permitted, but excluding ACEi and ARBs except as a last resort.

Control arm

Participants will continue on 'standard' care and will continue with their ACEi and/or ARB treatment. The choice and dose of ACEi and/or ARB will be at the discretion of the responsible clinician.

Both treatment groups

In both groups, BP will be controlled to the target pressure outlined in the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) Hypertension guideline and NICE CKD guideline of ≤ 140/85 mmHg. The monitoring of BP will be as per the NICE CKD guideline.

Blinding

Trial treatment will be open label, due to the practical difficulties and costs associated with using placebo in a trial of drug withdrawal. However, the primary outcome measure is an objective laboratory measure that reduces the need for blinding. Additionally, investigators taking part in the trial will remain blind to all trial outcome data for the duration of the trial to minimize bias, with un-blinded data presented only to the independent Data Monitoring and Ethical Committee (DMEC).

Results

Clinical characteristics

A total of 3183 eligible patients were enrolled between October 2008 and January 2010 at 39 medical centers and regional hospitals in Taiwan. Among them, 3093 (97.1%) subjects with renal parameters and 12 months outcome data were analyzed in this study and 1631 (52.7%) patients were STE-ACS. The mean age of the 3093 patients was 63.11 ± 13.50 years old and 78.2% of the patients were males.

Baseline creatinines were 2.74 ± 2.59 and 0.94 ± 0.18 mg/dl in the IGFR (n = 1226) and non-IGFR (n = 1867) groups, respectively. Compared with the non-IGFR patients, those with IGFR were older, thinner, lower diastolic blood pressure and faster heart rate and had lower percentage of male patients at presentation. Comorbidities, including hypertension, diabetes, previous coronary artery disease (CAD), previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA) and previous heart failure, were more common in IGFR group but percentage of smoking and family history of CAD were lower (Table 1).

Pharmacological management during admission and at discharge

Medications prescribed during the first 24 hours and at discharge are shown in Figure 1. Class I guideline-recommended agents including aspirin, clopidogrel, β-blocker, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor and statins were significantly less prescribed during admission and at discharge in patients with IGFR than those without IGFR, with the exception of angiotensin receptor antagonist.

### Multicentre randomized controlled trial of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor / angiotensin receptor blocker withdrawal in advanced renal disease: the STOP-ACEi trial [^115s1M1b]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Blood pressure (BP) control and reduction of urinary protein excretion using agents that block the renin–angiotensin aldosterone system are the mainstay of therapy for chronic kidney disease (CKD). Research has confirmed the benefits in mild CKD, but data on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) use in advanced CKD are lacking. In the STOP-ACEi trial, we aim to confirm preliminary findings which suggest that withdrawal of ACEi/ARB treatment can stabilize or even improve renal function in patients with advanced progressive CKD.

Methods

The STOP-ACEi trial (trial registration: current controlled trials, ISRCTN62869767) is an investigator-led multicentre open-label, randomized controlled clinical trial of 410 participants with advanced (Stage 4 or 5) progressive CKD receiving ACEi, ARBs or both. Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either discontinue ACEi, ARB or combination of both (experimental arm) or continue ACEi, ARB or combination of both (control arm). Patients will be followed up at 3 monthly intervals for 3 years. The primary outcome measure is eGFR at 3 years. Secondary outcome measures include the number of renal events, participant quality of life and physical functioning, hospitalization rates, BP and laboratory measures, including serum cystatin-C. Safety will be assessed to ensure that withdrawal of these treatments does not cause excess harm or increase mortality or cardiovascular events such as heart failure, myocardial infarction or stroke.

Results

The rationale and trial design are presented here. The results of this trial will show whether discontinuation of ACEi/ARBs can improve or stabilize renal function in patients with advanced progressive CKD. It will show whether this simple intervention can improve laboratory and clinical outcomes, including progression to end-stage renal disease, without causing an increase in cardiovascular events.

### The long-term impact of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibition on cardiorenal outcomes (LIRICO): a randomized, controlled trial [^112r9MmY]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The comparative effectiveness of treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), or their combination in people with albuminuria and cardiovascular risk factors is unclear.

Methods

In a multicenter, randomized, open label, blinded end point trial, we evaluated the effectiveness on cardiovascular events of ACE or ARB monotherapy or combination therapy, targeting BP < 130/80 in patients with moderate or severe albuminuria and diabetes or other cardiovascular risk factors. End points included a primary composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, and hospitalization for cardiovascular causes and a revised end point of all-cause mortality. Additional end points included ESRD, doubling of serum creatinine, albuminuria, eGFR, BP, and adverse events.

Results

Because of slow enrollment, the trial was modified and stopped 41% short of targeted enrollment of 2100 participants, corresponding to 35% power to detect a 25% reduced risk in the primary outcome. Our analysis included 1243 adults, with median follow-up of 2.7 years. Efficacy outcomes were similar between groups (ACE inhibitor versus ARB, ACE inhibitor versus combination, ARB versus combination) as were rates of serious adverse events. The rate of permanent discontinuation for ARB monotherapy (6.3%) was significantly lower than for ACE inhibitor monotherapy (15.7%) or combined therapy (18.3%).

Conclusions

Patients may tolerate ARB monotherapy better than ACE inhibitor monotherapy. However, data from this trial and similar trials, although as yet inconclusive, show no trend suggesting differences in mortality and renal outcomes with ACE inhibitors or ARBs as dual or monotherapy in patients with albuminuria and diabetes or other cardiovascular risk factors.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hemodialysis adequacy, update 2006 [^112A782n]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2006). Medium credibility.

Hypertension and ACE inhibitor/ARB considerations in hemodialysis (HD) — it is now generally accepted that the decrease in renal function observed in most patients treated with ACE inhibitors and ARBs is reversible and reno-protective, even in patients with CKD stage 5; however, the drug-induced decrease in GFR causes an increase in levels of BUN, creatinine, and other solutes and may decrease urine output, and irreversible loss of renal function may occur in patients with ischemic renal disease treated with ACE inhibitors. Severe hypertension is well known to damage normal kidneys acutely and can cause ongoing damage over years, and control of hypertension after initiating dialysis therapy has been associated with improvement in RKF, sometimes allowing discontinuation of dialysis therapy; these patients should be identified from the beginning, and special attention should be given to controlling blood pressure for the purpose of preserving and possibly improving RKF.

HFrEF with kidney impairment — sacubitril/valsartan dosing, mineralocorticoid antagonist contraindications, and monitoring: In moderate kidney impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] ≥ 30 and < 60 mL/min/1.73 m²) no starting-dose adjustment of sacubitril/valsartan is needed, whereas in severe kidney impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²) the starting dose should be reduced to 24/26 mg twice daily; mineralocorticoid antagonists are contraindicated with eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m², creatinine > 2.5 mg/dL in men or > 2 mg/dL in women, or potassium > 5.0 mEq/L; kidney function and potassium should be assessed within 1 to 2 weeks after initiation or dose increase of an ARNI/ACE inhibitor/ARB and within 1 to 2 weeks after starting or titrating mineralocorticoid antagonists, with subsequent monitoring at least monthly for the first 3 months and every 3 months thereafter.

### Clinical decision support for hypertension management in chronic kidney disease: a randomized clinical trial [^117YJ5jp]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Chronic kidney disease (CKD), defined by abnormal kidney function for greater than 3 months and quantified by an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 or urine albumin to creatinine ratio (UACR) 30 mg/g or greater, affects 8% to 16% of the adult population globally. The prevalence of CKD has increased over time, which is partly attributed to the increase in CKD risk factors, including sociodemographic factors, genetic factors, and comorbidities, such as diabetes or hypertension. Hypertension affects 60% to 90% of people with CKD and is associated with worse kidney outcomes, as well as increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Lowering blood pressure (BP) in patients with CKD has been associated with better cardiovascular and all-cause mortality and is a core goal in published guidelines for the treatment of this population of patients. Evidence-based management of hypertension in patients with CKD involves the use of renoprotective first-line agents, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). Yet, despite national efforts to increase awareness of CKD, few patients with stage 3 to 4 CKD are aware of their disease; in addition, hypertension treatment in CKD remains suboptimal in primary care settings.

Primary care practitioners (PCPs) play a critical role in reducing the burden of CKD by identifying patients with CKD and addressing risk factors, like hypertension and diabetes. Referral of patients to nephrology care is associated with cost and morbidity and mortality benefits, but access to ambulatory nephrology care does not match the need at a population level. Studies have shown that PCPs are not always aware of CKD management guidelines and face barriers to implementing them. Computerized clinical decision support (CDS) systems aim to close this gap by providing PCPs with person-specific information and timely evidence-based recommendations.

Studies of CDS systems for CKD management have shown mixed results. Positive results have included decreased annualized loss of eGFR, increased rate of diagnosis, increased urine albumin testing, and increased referral to nephrologists. By contrast, other studies have shown no significant benefit of CDS for mitigating cardiovascular risk factors, including BP control. Unintended consequences of CDS impact its effectiveness. Behavioral economics has potential to increase effectiveness of CDS by addressing the psychological factors that impact decision-making. A behavioral economic nudge is a change in the choice architecture that may alter behavior in a predictable way while preserving options.

### Acute treatment effects on GFR in randomized clinical trials of kidney disease progression [^111mwAiG]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute changes in GFR can occur after initiation of interventions targeting progression of CKD. These acute changes complicate the interpretation of long-term treatment effects.

Methods

To assess the magnitude and consistency of acute effects in randomized clinical trials and explore factors that might affect them, we performed a meta-analysis of 53 randomized clinical trials for CKD progression, enrolling 56,413 participants with at least one estimated GFR measurement by 6 months after randomization. We defined acute treatment effects as the mean difference in GFR slope from baseline to 3 months between randomized groups. We performed univariable and multivariable metaregression to assess the effect of intervention type, disease state, baseline GFR, and albuminuria on the magnitude of acute effects.

Results

The mean acute effect across all studies was -0.21 ml/min per 1.73 m² (95% confidence interval, -0.63 to 0.22) over 3 months, with substantial heterogeneity across interventions (95% coverage interval across studies, -2.50 to +2.08 ml/min per 1.73 m 2). We observed negative average acute effects in renin angiotensin system blockade, BP lowering, and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor trials, and positive acute effects in trials of immunosuppressive agents. Larger negative acute effects were observed in trials with a higher mean baseline GFR.

Conclusion

The magnitude and consistency of acute GFR effects vary across different interventions, and are larger at higher baseline GFR. Understanding the nature and magnitude of acute effects can help inform the optimal design of randomized clinical trials evaluating disease progression in CKD.

### Effect of inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system and other antihypertensive drugs on renal outcomes: systematic review and meta-analysis [^113diAfM]. Lancet (2005). Excellent credibility.

Background

A consensus has emerged that angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin-II receptor blockers (ARBs) have specific renoprotective effects. Guidelines specify that these are the drugs of choice for the treatment of hypertension in patients with renal disease. We sought to determine to what extent this consensus is supported by the available evidence.

Methods

Electronic databases were searched up to January, 2005, for randomised trials assessing antihypertensive drugs and progression of renal disease. Effects on primary discrete endpoints (doubling of creatinine and end-stage renal disease) and secondary continuous markers of renal outcomes (creatinine, albuminuria, and glomerular filtration rate) were calculated with random-effect models. The effects of ACE inhibitors or ARBs in placebo-controlled trials were compared with the effects seen in trials that used an active comparator drug.

Findings

Comparisons of ACE inhibitors or ARBs with other antihypertensive drugs yielded a relative risk of 0.71 (95% CI 0.49–1.04) for doubling of creatinine and a small benefit on end-stage renal disease (relative risk 0.87, 0.75–0.99). Analyses of the results by study size showed a smaller benefit in large studies. In patients with diabetic nephropathy, no benefit was seen in comparative trials of ACE inhibitors or ARBs on the doubling of creatinine (1.09, 0.55–2.15), end-stage renal disease (0.89, 0.74–1.07), glomerular filtration rate, or creatinine amounts. Placebo-controlled trials of ACE inhibitors or ARBs showed greater benefits than comparative trials on all renal outcomes, but were accompanied by substantial reductions in blood pressure in favour of ACE inhibitors or ARBs.

Interpretation

The benefits of ACE inhibitors or ARBs on renal outcomes in placebo-controlled trials probably result from a blood-pressure-lowering effect. In patients with diabetes, additional renoprotective actions of these substances beyond lowering blood pressure remain unproven, and there is uncertainty about the greater renoprotection seen in non-diabetic renal disease.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of CKD [^1138ivYJ]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

KDOQI commentary — referral refinements for albuminuria and ACE-inhibitor/ARB issues: We agree that the consideration of both GFR and albuminuria will guide appropriate referrals and that referral of all patients with CKD stage 4 or worse will promote interventions to delay progression and reduce CKD complications; in the opinion of the commentary work group, 2 groups of patients who should be referred are those with side effects or contraindications to ACE-inhibitor/ARB therapy, but albuminuria > 300 mg/g or nephrotic-range albuminuria or proteinuria; we suggest modifying the list above to add questions about the etiology of albuminuria and difficulty with decreasing level of albuminuria despite institution of ACE-inhibitor or ARB therapy.

### Adverse effects during treatment with renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors; should we stay or should we stop? [^1152yzdz]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To discuss recent evidence on the benefits and harms of stopping therapy with renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASi) after the occurrence of adverse events or in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Recent Findings

RAASi may result hyperkalemia or acute kidney injury (AKI), particularly in persons with CKD. Guidelines recommend to temporarily stop RAASi until the problem is resolved. However permanent discontinuation of RAASi is common in clinical practice with the potential to heighten subsequent cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. A series of studies evaluating the consequences of stopping RAASi (vs. continuing) after an episode of hyperkalemia or AKI consistently report worse clinical outcomes, both higher risk of death and cardiovascular events. The STOP-angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) trial and two large observational studies also favor the decision to continue ACEi/ angiotensin receptor blockers in advanced CKD, refuting old observations that use of these medications can accelerate the risk of kidney replacement therapy.

Summary

Available evidence suggests continuing with RAASi after the occurrence of adverse events or in patients with advanced CKD, primarily attributed to sustained cardioprotection. This is in line with current guideline recommendations.

### Change in renal function associated with drug treatment in heart failure: national guidance [^116fN4cF]. Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

Changes in kidney function after initiation of drug treatment

A decline in renal function is commonly seen in patients when they start an ACEI, ARB or sacubitril/valsartan and is usually modest. The decline is attributable to loss of renal efferent arteriolar vasoconstriction and an acute decrease in intraglomerular pressure, with subsequent fall in GFR. Renal function may actually improve: in Cooperative North Scandinavian Enalapril Survival Study (CONSENSUS), although the average increase in creatinine was 44 µmol/L at 2 weeks, in nearly a quarter of patients creatinine declined.RAAS inhibitors can decrease the rate at which renal function subsequently declines, despite an apparent initial worsening.

The deterioration in renal function may also indicate haemodynamically significant renal artery stenosis or intrarenal vascular disease. For a small proportion of patients, particularly those with bilateral renovascular disease, initiation of ACEI/ARB can result in substantial and irreversible declines in renal function or life-threatening hyperkalaemia. In those rare cases with profound decline in GFR post-RAAS inhibitor, renal artery stenosis should be actively sought with decision on revascularisation made on an individual patient basis.

Important questions are: (1) whether there is a level of decline in renal function related to ACEI/ARB initiation beyond which the risk of continuing treatment outweighs the benefits; and (2) whether the risk:benefit balance depends on the indication for treatment.

One of the pitfalls in caring for patients with heart failure is premature discontinuation of RAAS inhibitors when renal function declines during initiation or uptitration of the drugs. Worsening renal function is more common in patients treated with ACEI and ARB. Among patients with HFrEF, those with worse renal function at baseline, and those who have a greater decline in renal function during initiation of RAAS inhibitors, have a worse prognosis than those who do not; however, they gain a greater relative benefit from RAAS inhibitors. In patients with HFpEF, worse renal function is again associated with higher mortality, but in contrast to patients with HFrEF, worsening renal function on RAAS inhibitors is associated with increased mortality.

### Initiating renin-angiotensin system inhibitors in chronic kidney disease [^115wSxA1]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2025). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a heterogeneous group of disorders characterised by abnormalities in kidney structure or function, present for at least 3 months. Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors are established treatments in the management of CKD, reducing the risk of adverse kidney and cardiovascular events. Despite an extensive evidence base and decades of clinical experience, they remain underused, underdosed and frequently discontinued due to concerns about changes in kidney function and hyperkalaemia. In this article, we provide an overview of initiating RAS inhibitors in adults with CKD, highlight current guideline recommendations and offer a practical approach to dealing with the challenges associated with their use.

### Continuation of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone inhibitors does not impact renal function among patients undergoing percutaneous nephrolithotomy [^112r4w6K]. Journal of Endourology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

In the perioperative period, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors may result in cardiovascular and renal functional changes. We sought to determine the acute and chronic renal functional and blood pressure effects of continuing or withdrawing angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) after percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL).

Materials and Methods

This was a retrospective review of all patients undergoing PCNL at our institution from 2002 to 2013. Patients on either an ACE-I and/or ARB who received an ACE-I and/or ARB during their surgical hospitalization were matched based on sex, age, and body mass index to patients who had their medication withheld during the postoperative period. The two groups were compared.

Results

A total of 2784 patients underwent PCNL during the study period. At the time of PCNL, 15.2% (423/2784) of patients and 6.5% (181/2784) were prescribed an ACE-I and an ARB, respectively. Fifty-nine percent (248/423) of patients on an ACE-I and 66.9% (121/181) on an ARB received their medication during their postoperative hospitalization. There was no significant difference in average length of stay (2 days vs 2 days), perioperative change in glomerular filtration rate, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (-0.50mL/min/1.73m 2 vs -2.34mL/min/1.73m 2, p = 0.267), change in GFR at 1 month postoperatively (-4.63mL/min/1.73m 2 vs -5.90mL/min/1.73m 2, p = 0.748), or change in GFR at 1 year (-2.08mL/min/1.73m 2 vs -0.13mL/min/1.73m 2, p = 0.267) between patients who received vs withheld their medication during the postoperative stay.

Conclusion

It is safe to continue RAAS inhibitors in patients undergoing PCNL during their operative hospitalization.

### WITHDRAWN: angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in normotensive diabetic patients with microalbuminuria [^115CLDmN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Renal disease is a serious complication of diabetes mellitus.

Objectives

To examine whether the progression of early diabetic renal disease to end-stage renal failure may be slowed by the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors for reasons other than their antihypertensive properties, so that they have value in the treatment of normotensive diabetics with microalbuminuria.

Search Strategy

Medline was searched for English language reviews and randomised controlled trials. Personal reference lists, and reference lists of retrieved studies were also used.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials with separate identifiable results for initially normotensive diabetic patients, who received angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors for at least one year and were compared with controls.

Data Collection and Analysis

Meta-analyses were performed on the results of 12 randomised controlled trials with a variety of patient inclusion and exclusion criteria. One further study met all conditions for inclusion but did not provide data in useable form for meta-analyses.

Main Results

Albumin excretion rate fell for patients on angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition in 12 of the 13 studies but did so for only two of the 13 groups on placebo. Treatment provided a significant reduction in albumin excretion rate in both insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. Treatment with either captopril, enalapril or lisinopril reduced albumin excretion rate in comparison with control patients. A significantly greater lowering of blood pressure was experienced by initially normotensive patients in the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor than in the placebo group. Average glycosylated haemoglobin fell a little in the treated patients and rose in the controls, the difference being just significant. The difference in changes in glomerular filtration rate did not reach statistical significance.

Authors' Conclusions

Inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme can arrest or reduce the albumin excretion rate in microalbuminuric normotensive diabetics, as well as reduce or prevent an increase in blood pressure. But, given the drop in blood pressure in patients on angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, it is not certain that the reduction of albumin excretion rate is due to a separate renal effect. A direct link with postponement of end-stage renal failure has not been demonstrated. There appear to be no substantial side effects.

### Aldosterone antagonists for preventing the progression of chronic kidney disease [^116R8tnE]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) is increasingly used to reduce proteinuria and retard the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). But some patients do not attain complete resolution of proteinuria and might have higher aldosterone levels within few months of treatment. The addition of aldosterone antagonists may be beneficial to these patients for reduction of progression of renal damage.

Objectives

We evaluated the benefits and harms of adding aldosterone antagonists in patients with CKD currently treated with ACEi and/or ARB.

Search Strategy

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and hand-searched reference lists of textbooks, articles and scientific proceedings for relevant articles.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing aldosterone antagonists in addition to ACEi and/or ARB versus ACEi and/or ARB alone were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. Statistical analyses were performed using a random effects model and heterogeneity was tested formally using the Cochran Q and I(2) statistic. Results were expressed as mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes and risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

Ten studies (845 patients) were included. Compared to ACEi and/or ARB plus placebo, non-selective aldosterone antagonists along with ACEi and/or ARB significantly reduced 24 hour proteinuria (7 studies, 372 patients; MD -0.80 g, 95% CI -1.23 to -0.38). There was a significant reduction in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure at the end of treatment with the addition of non-selective aldosterone antagonists to ACEi and/or ARB. This did not translate into an improvement in glomerular filtration rate (5 studies, 306 patients; MD -0.70 mL/min/1.73 m(2), 95% CI -4.73 to 3.34). There was a significant increase in the risk of hyperkalaemia with the addition of non-selective aldosterone antagonists to ACEi and/or ARB (8 studies, 436 patients; RR 3.06, 95% CI 1.26 to 7.41). In two studies, the addition of selective aldosterone antagonists to ACEi resulted in an additional reduction in 24 hour proteinuria but without any impact on BP and renal function. Data on cardiovascular outcomes, long-term renal outcomes and mortality were not available.

Authors' Conclusions

Aldosterone antagonists contribute to reduction of proteinuria in patients with CKD who are already on ACEi and ARB but increase the risk of hyperkalaemia. Available studies are small and have short follow-up. Long-term effects on renal outcomes, mortality and safety are unknown.

### Evaluation of the stopping angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor compared to angiotensin receptor blocker (STOP ACEi trial) in advanced and progressive chronic kidney disease [^117Cjtr6]. Kidney International (2024). Medium credibility.

In the STOP-ACEi trial, the outcome was similar whether or not renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RASi) were discontinued. We now investigate whether the effect of withdrawing angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) differed. In this open label trial patients with estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFR) under 30ml/min per 1.73 m 2 and progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD) were randomized to stop or continue RASi. The primary outcome was eGFR at three years. The composite of kidney failure, over 50% fall in eGFR, or kidney replacement therapy (KRT) was also assessed. Of patients randomized, 99 stopped and 123 patients continued ACEi while 104 stopped and 77 continued ARB at baseline. At three years, the eGFR was similar whether or not patients were withdrawn from ACEi or from ARB. Kidney failure or initiation of KRT occurred in 65% of those stopping and 54% continuing ACEi (hazard ratio if stopped, 1.52; 95% Confidence Interval, 1.07 to 2.16) and in 60% on an ARB regardless of randomized group (hazard ratio if stopped, 1.23; 0.83 to 1.81). Kidney failure/Initiation of KRT with over 50% decline in eGFR occurred in 71% of those stopping and 59% continuing ACEi (relative risk if stopped, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.41) and in 65% stopping and 69% continuing ARB (relative risk if stopped, 0.96; 0.79 to 1.16). Thus, neither discontinuing ACEi nor ARB slowed the rate of decline in eGFR. Although discontinuation of ACEi appeared to have more unfavorable effects on kidney outcomes than stopping ARB, the trial was neither designed nor powered to show differences between agents.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Kidney dysfunction/injury — monitoring and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitor (RAASi) effects are outlined with explicit thresholds. Estimated GFR using serum creatinine should be measured 2 to 4 weeks after initiation or dose titration of antihypertensive medications. RAASi may cause an expected short-term dip in eGFR of up to 30% that is associated with preservation of kidney function and should not lead to discontinuation unless the decline in eGFR is persistently > 30%. A referral to a nephrologist is appropriate to evaluate other causes, and new dysfunction after adding or increasing diuretics should prompt evaluation of volume status; it may be appropriate to initially hold or reduce the diuretic dose and then advance more slowly.

Renin–angiotensin system blockade in diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD) — given the proven cardiovascular benefits and shared properties of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in inhibiting the renin–angiotensin system (RAS), either type of agent should be strongly considered for people with diabetes and CKD because they reduce the risk of both cardiovascular disease (CVD) events and progression of kidney disease.

Results

Patient characteristics

Of the 1118 patients, 717 were included for the survival analysis (Fig. 1). Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of the analytical cohorts in the two groups. The characteristics of the eligible patients were similar to those of patients excluded due to non-using, newly starting RASIs or unknown data (Supplementary Table 1). The mean ± SD age of 717 study participants at HD initiation was 67 ± 13 years, and 68% were male. The numbers of patients with continuing and stopping RASIs were 650 (91%) and 67 (9.3%), respectively. Patients who stopped RASIs had a shorter duration of nephrology care, more frequent urgent dialysis, faster eGFR decline, and higher serum C-reactive protein levels than those who continued RASIs. Missing data were found in ≤ 5% of all variables (Supplementary Table 2).

### Renin-angiotensin system inhibition in advanced chronic kidney disease [^115swCKa]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

The study STOP-ACEi was published by Sunil Bhandari and colleagues in 2022 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Chronic kidney disease. In the STOP-ACEi study, the trial question was: what is the effect of discontinuation of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors in patients with advanced CKD? In the STOP-ACEi study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the STOP-ACEi study, the population was: 411 patients (130 female, 281 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with advanced and progressive CKD. The key exclusion criteria were uncontrolled hypertension; history of myocardial infarction or stroke within the previous 3 months. In the STOP-ACEi study, the interventions were: n = 206 renin-angiotensin system inhibitor discontinuation (use of any guideline-recommended antihypertensive agent other than renin-angiotensin system inhibitors) n = 205 renin-angiotensin system inhibitor continuation (renin-angiotensin system inhibitor with/without any other guideline-recommended antihypertensive agent). In the STOP-ACEi study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in eGFR at 3 years (12.6 vs. 13.3; AD -0.7, 95% CI -2.5 to 1). In the STOP-ACEi study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in end-stage kidney disease or RRT (62% vs. 56%; HR 1.28, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.65) No significant difference in patients experiencing > 50% decline in eGFR or initiation of RRT (68% vs. 63%; RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.22) No significant difference in death (10% vs. 11%; HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.57). In the STOP-ACEi study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in serious adverse events. In the STOP-ACEi study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with advanced and progressive CKD, renin-angiotensin system inhibitor discontinuation was not superior to renin-angiotensin system inhibitor continuation with respect to eGFR at 3 years.

### Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers for advanced chronic kidney disease: a systematic review and retrospective individual participant-level meta-analysis of clinical trials [^115cpPxP]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

In patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD), the effects of initiating treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin-receptor blocker (ARB) on the risk for kidney failure with replacement therapy (KFRT) and death remain unclear.

Purpose

To examine the association of ACEi or ARB treatment initiation, relative to a non-ACEi or ARB comparator, with rates of KFRT and death.

Data Sources

Ovid Medline and the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration Clinical Trials Consortium from 1946 through 31 December 2023.

Study Selection

Completed randomized controlled trials testing either an ACEi or an ARB versus a comparator (placebo or antihypertensive drugs other than ACEi or ARB) that included patients with a baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) below 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2.

Data Extraction

The primary outcome was KFRT, and the secondary outcome was death before KFRT. Analyses were done using Cox proportional hazards models according to the intention-to-treat principle. Prespecified subgroup analyses were done according to baseline age (< 65 vs. ≥ 65 years), eGFR (< 20 vs. ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m 2), albuminuria (urine albumin-creatinine ratio < 300 vs. ≥ 300 mg/g), and history of diabetes.

Data Synthesis

A total of 1739 participants from 18 trials were included, with a mean age of 54.9 years and mean eGFR of 22.2 mL/min/1.73 m 2, of whom 624 (35.9%) developed KFRT and 133 (7.6%) died during a median follow-up of 34 months (IQR, 19 to 40 months). Overall, ACEi or ARB treatment initiation led to lower risk for KFRT (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.55 to 0.79]) but not death (hazard ratio, 0.86 [CI, 0.58 to 1.28]). There was no statistically significant interaction between ACEi or ARB treatment and age, eGFR, albuminuria, or diabetes (P for interaction > 0.05 for all).

Limitation

Individual participant-level data for hyperkalemia or acute kidney injury were not available.

Conclusion

Initiation of ACEi or ARB therapy protects against KFRT, but not death, in people with advanced CKD.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of chronic kidney disease [^1153y3zD]. VA/DoD (2025). High credibility.

Hypertension in chronic kidney disease — blood pressure and renin–angiotensin system management are stated as follows: We suggest intensive blood pressure management to reduce mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate below 60 mL/minute/1.73 m2. In patients with hypertension and albuminuria (i.e., urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio [UACR] > 30 mg/g), we recommend the use of either an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker to slow the progression of chronic kidney disease. We suggest the addition of a thiazide diuretic or calcium channel blocker to reduce blood pressure in patients with chronic kidney disease and hypertension not controlled on an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker. In patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²) currently on an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker, we suggest continuing therapy, unless there is drug intolerance or other adverse event.

### The cardio-kidney patient: epidemiology, clinical characteristics and therapy [^111u4bWf]. Circulation Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Prognostic improvement has best been documented for ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors, which in a network meta-analysis of 44 randomized trials including 42 319 patients with CKD lowered kidney events by 46% (OR, 0.54 [95% CI, 0.41–0.73]), cardiovascular events by 27% (OR, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.64–0.84]), cardiovascular death by 27% (OR, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.63–0.86]), and all-cause death by 23% (OR, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.66–0.91]) when compared with placebo. Still, blood pressure lowering especially with renin-angiotensin-system (RAS) inhibitors often increases serum creatinine. This is thought to reflect reversible hemodynamic effects in the kidney and not renal injury. The recently published STOP ACEi trial (multi-centre randomised controlled trial of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor [ACEi]/angiotensin receptor blocker [ARB] withdrawal in advanced renal disease) randomized 411 patients with advanced CKD (eGFR, < 30 mL/min per 1.73 m² of the body surface area) to either discontinuation or continuation of RAS inhibition. During a mean follow-up of 3 years, no difference was observed in renal function between both treatment groups while end-stage kidney disease occurred numerically more often in the discontinuation group (62% versus 56%; HR, 1.28 [95% CI, 0.99–1.65]). No statistical difference in adverse events was found between both groups, which by number occurred, however, more often in the discontinuation group (cardiovascular events, 108 versus 88; deaths, 20 versus 22). These results support the continuation of RAS inhibition in advanced kidney disease.

### The association of withholding or continuing angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin 2 receptor blockers on acute kidney injury after non-cardiac surgery [^116gwfGh]. Anaesthesia (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Withholding or continuing angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin 2 receptor blockers peri-operatively in non-cardiac surgery remains controversial as they may result in intra-operative hypotension and postoperative organ damage.

Methods

We included patients prescribed angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin 2 receptor blockers who underwent surgical procedures > 1h duration under general or spinal anaesthesia from January 2012 to June 2022 in a single centre. We categorised patients by whether these drugs were withheld for 24h before surgery. We evaluated the association of withholding these drugs before non-cardiac surgery with creatinine concentrations that increased ≥ 26.4μmol.l⁻¹ in the first 48 postoperative hours (acute kidney injury). We also analysed changes in creatinine concentrations and estimated glomerular filtration rates.

Results

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin 2 receptor blockers were withheld in 24,285 of 32,933 (74%) patients and continued in 8648 (26%) patients. We used propensity scores for drug discontinuation to match 8631 patient pairs who did or did not continue these drugs: acute kidney injury was recorded for 1791 (21%) patients who continued these drugs vs. 1587 (18%) who did not (OR (95%CI) 1.16 (1.08–1.25), p < 0.001). Intra-operative hypotension was recorded for 3892 (45%) patients who continued drugs vs. 3373 (39%) patients who did not (OR (95%CI) 1.28 (1.21–1.36), p < 0.001). Continuing drugs was independently associated with a mean increase in creatinine of 2.2μmol.l⁻¹ (p < 0.001) and a mean decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate of 1.4ml.min.1.73m⁻² (p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Continuing angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin 2 receptor blockers 24h before non-cardiac surgery was associated with intra-operative hypotension and postoperative acute kidney injury.

### The impact of stopping inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease [^116pFhiN]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) has shown to slow chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression. This is most notable at the earlier stages of diabetic and proteinuric nephropathies. Objective. Here, we observed the impact of discontinuation of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi)/angiotensin receptors blockers (ARB) in patients with advanced kidney disease.

Methods

52 patients (21 females and 31 males) with advanced CKD (stages 4 and 5), who attended our low clearance clinic (LCC) in preparation for renal replacement therapy (RRT). Mean age was 73.3 ± 1.8 years with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 16.38 ± 1 ml/min/1.73 m(2). Baseline urine protein:creatinine ratio (PCR) was 77 ± 20 mg/mmol. 46% suffered from diabetes mellitus. Patients were followed for at least 12 months before and after ACEi/ARB were stopped.

Results

12 months after discontinuation of ACEi/ARB eGFR increased significantly to 26.6 ± 2.2 ml/min/ 1.73 m(2) (p = 0.0001). 61.5% of patients had more than a 25% increase in eGFR, whilst 36.5% had an increase exceeding 50%. There was a significant decline in the eGFR slope -0.39 ± 0.07 in the 12 months preceding discontinuation. The negative slope was reversed +0.48 ± 0.1 (p = 0.0001). Mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) increased from 90 ± 1.8 mmHg to 94 ± 1.3 mmHg (p = 0.02), however ≥ 50% of patients remained within target. Overall proteinuria was not affected (PCR before = 77 ± 20 and after = 121.6 ± 33.6 mg/mmol).

Conclusion

Discontinuation of ACEi/ARB has undoubtedly delayed the onset of RRT in the majority of those studied. This observation may justify a rethink of our approach to the inhibition of the RAAS in patients with advanced CKD who are nearing the start of RRT.
