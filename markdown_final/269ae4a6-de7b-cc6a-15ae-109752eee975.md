## Question

Pathophysiology of schizophrenia and diagnostic imaging

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and the role of diagnostic imaging. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core pathophysiological mechanisms that are consistently supported by converging evidence. Then, I should verify which imaging modalities map onto these mechanisms and what they actually measure. Next, I will appraise the clinical utility of these imaging findings for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment response, and I need to be careful not to overstate what is ready for practice. After that, I should consider emerging biomarkers and the heterogeneity problem, including machine learning and transdiagnostic issues. Finally, I will integrate this into a cautious, clinically oriented conclusion and highlight knowledge gaps and next steps.

> Let me first confirm the dominant pathophysiological themes. Schizophrenia reflects a neurodevelopmental disorder with multifactorial etiology, involving genetic liability, early neurodevelopmental insults, and later maturational processes, producing distributed brain abnormalities rather than a focal lesion, and this framework is consistently supported by large-scale structural and functional imaging literatures and expert reviews [^944a588e] [^8b7b6e3f] [^77dc675a].

> I will now examine dopaminergic dysregulation as a key mechanism. Wait, let me verify the directionality and regional specificity. Multiple PET studies show increased presynaptic striatal dopamine synthesis capacity in schizophrenia and in clinical high-risk states, with associations to psychotic symptom severity, supporting a transdiagnostic dopamine mechanism for psychosis rather than a schizophrenia-specific marker, and this aligns with the updated dopamine hypothesis that integrates upstream risk factors converging on striatal dopamine [^41e35ba5] [^44ec82ca] [^f80a908c].

> Next, I should review glutamatergic and GABAergic dysfunction. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; while NMDA receptor hypofunction and downstream GABAergic interneuron deficits are repeatedly implicated, causality versus compensation remains debated. Still, in vivo and translational work supports cortical glutamatergic abnormalities and reduced GABA levels in frontal regions, and recent in vivo astrocyte imaging with MAO-B PET suggests reactive astrocytes in ACC and hippocampus linking glutamate handling and neuroinflammation to positive symptoms, which strengthens the mechanistic plausibility of glutamatergic-GABAergic-dopamine interactions [^3489b942] [^f80a908c] [^2beb9715] [^f7ec7ed2].

> I need to check structural brain changes next. Meta-analyses and mega-analyses consistently show reduced cortical gray matter volume and thickness, subcortical volume reductions, and ventricular enlargement, with some changes predating illness onset and correlating with symptom severity and cognitive impairment; longitudinal data also suggest progressive changes in a subset, though confounding by illness chronicity and treatment must be considered, and diffusion imaging reveals widespread white matter microstructural abnormalities consistent with dysconnectivity [^944a588e] [^6099078c] [^9da8ac46].

> Let me consider network-level dysfunction. Functional and structural connectivity studies converge on disrupted salience, default mode, and frontoparietal networks, with hub vulnerability whereby highly connected temporo-frontal regions show greater cortical thinning, supporting a systems-level model of schizophrenia as a network disorder with emergent clinical phenotypes from distributed circuit dysfunction [^99869f1a] [^7e4e54c3] [^d04bb7d7].

> Now, I should map imaging modalities to these mechanisms. Structural MRI quantifies gray and white matter volumes and cortical thickness, diffusion MRI assesses white matter integrity and tract organization, fMRI captures functional connectivity and network dynamics, PET probes neurotransmitter systems such as dopamine, glutamate, GABA, and microglia or astrocyte markers, and MR spectroscopy estimates neurometabolites like glutamate and GABA; each modality contributes complementary information, but no single modality captures the full pathophysiology [^944a588e] [^7b734093] [^aec6258a] [^fea7debc].

> Hold on, I should verify clinical utility for diagnosis. Despite decades of research, no imaging biomarker meets FDA-level diagnostic performance in individual patients, and major guidelines advise against routine neuroimaging for psychosis unless neurological red flags are present; machine learning approaches can classify patients versus controls with modest accuracy, but sensitivity and specificity remain insufficient for clinical diagnosis, and heterogeneity limits generalizability [^338b02cb] [^5496d5b2] [^ea6e9cc1] [^37f715eb].

> Next, I should review prognostic utility. Imaging can enrich risk stratification in clinical high-risk cohorts, but clinical high-risk criteria alone have limited specificity; structural and functional markers show promise for predicting transition to psychosis, yet prospective, standardized, multicenter studies are still needed before routine clinical use, and VA/DoD guidance concludes insufficient evidence to recommend MRI-based prediction systems for psychosis risk [^c6756c34] [^19d3236e] [^4ffe799f].

> I will now examine treatment response and precision medicine. PET-derived striatal dopamine synthesis capacity correlates with antipsychotic response, and fMRI studies show normalization of corticostriatal connectivity with symptom improvement, supporting the concept of dopamine-responsive and non–dopamine-responsive subtypes; pharmacological fMRI and multimodal strategies are being explored to match patients to mechanisms and optimize outcomes, but these remain investigational [^867fa592] [^73851364].

> But wait, what about emerging biomarkers. In vivo astrocyte imaging with MAO-B PET is a notable advance linking glutamate handling and neuroinflammation to positive symptoms, and retinal imaging shows reproducible thinning of retinal layers correlating with brain volume loss and cognitive deficits, offering noninvasive, scalable markers; however, these require validation and standardization before clinical deployment [^2beb9715] [^f7ec7ed2] [^b2477832] [^05ad4e3b].

> I should double-check the heterogeneity problem. Data-driven clustering and machine learning reveal neuroanatomical subtypes with distinct trajectories and clinical correlates, and transdiagnostic imaging studies show shared neural vulnerabilities across psychotic and mood disorders, underscoring the need to move beyond categorical diagnoses and toward dimensional, mechanism-based phenotypes [^123778d3] [^7e4e54c3] [^5f1de7ac].

> Let me reconsider the clinical implications and limitations. Imaging has clarified mechanisms and generated testable hypotheses, but effect sizes are modest, reproducibility varies across sites, and confounding by illness chronicity, antipsychotic exposure, and comorbidities complicate interpretation; large, harmonized, longitudinal datasets and integration with genetics and cognition are essential to translate findings into clinically actionable tools [^944a588e] [^66be7106] [^7b5c50f9].

> In summary, I need to ensure the message is precise. Schizophrenia reflects a neurodevelopmental, multisystem disorder with converging dopaminergic, glutamatergic, GABAergic, and network-level abnormalities; imaging has mapped these systems but has not yet delivered standalone diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers for routine care, though it is informing subtype stratification, treatment mechanism studies, and early intervention research, and emerging markers like reactive astrocyte PET and retinal oculomics warrant continued validation [^8b7b6e3f] [^944a588e] [^2beb9715] [^b2477832].

Schizophrenia reflects a **neurodevelopmental disorder** with multifactorial etiology, characterized by disrupted connectivity, dopaminergic dysregulation, and progressive structural brain changes [^8b7b6e3f] [^f80a908c] [^944a588e]. Neuroimaging consistently shows **reduced gray matter volume**, **enlarged ventricles**, and **white matter abnormalities**, especially in frontal, temporal, and hippocampal regions, with some changes evident before illness onset [^944a588e] [^6099078c] [^7fbe3fe8]. Functional imaging reveals altered connectivity in salience, default mode, and frontoparietal networks, correlating with positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms [^99869f1a] [^d04bb7d7]. PET studies demonstrate increased striatal dopamine synthesis capacity in psychosis, supporting the dopamine hypothesis [^41e35ba5] [^44ec82ca]. Despite these findings, **no imaging biomarker is ready for routine diagnosis** due to heterogeneity and limited specificity; imaging remains adjunctive, not diagnostic [^5496d5b2] [^338b02cb].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

Several **interconnected mechanisms** underlie schizophrenia:

- **Neurodevelopmental model**: Early brain injury, genetic vulnerabilities, and environmental factors (e.g. obstetric complications, cannabis use) interact to disrupt normal brain development, leading to later emergence of symptoms [^77dc675a] [^5fbaf134].

- **Dopamine hypothesis**: Hyperdopaminergia in mesolimbic pathways drives positive symptoms; hypodopaminergia in mesocortical pathways contributes to negative and cognitive symptoms [^44ec82ca] [^f80a908c].

- **Glutamatergic dysfunction**: NMDA receptor hypofunction causes excitatory-inhibitory imbalance, disrupting neural circuits and contributing to psychosis and cognitive deficits [^3489b942] [^a7a87244].

- **Connectivity hypothesis**: Widespread dysconnectivity among frontal, temporal, and parietal regions underlies the disorder's heterogeneous symptoms [^99869f1a] [^7e4e54c3].

---

## Structural brain abnormalities

Structural MRI studies have identified consistent abnormalities in schizophrenia:

| **Brain region** | **Findings** |
|-|-|
| Frontal cortex | Reduced gray matter volume, cortical thinning, and decreased surface area [^944a588e] [^97946b13] |
| Temporal cortex | Volume reductions, particularly in the superior temporal gyrus and hippocampus [^944a588e] [^c1e95f94] |
| Parietal cortex | Reduced cortical thickness and volume [^944a588e] |
| Thalamus | Reduced volume and altered morphology [^c1e95f94] [^944a588e] |
| Ventricles | Enlarged lateral and third ventricles indicating generalized brain volume loss [^6099078c] [^944a588e] |
| White matter | Reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) indicating microstructural abnormalities and dysconnectivity [^9da8ac46] [^89d8cc80] |

---

These changes are evident in **first-episode and chronic schizophrenia**, with some abnormalities (e.g. ventricular enlargement) progressing over time, suggesting both neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative components [^6099078c] [^944a588e].

---

## Functional brain abnormalities

Functional MRI (fMRI) studies reveal **altered activity and connectivity** in schizophrenia:

- **Default mode network (DMN)**: Hyperconnectivity within the DMN and reduced task-related deactivation are associated with impaired self-referential processing and cognitive deficits [^c0a1066f].

- **Salience network**: Hypoconnectivity between the anterior insula and other brain regions impairs detection of salient stimuli, contributing to psychotic symptoms [^a166c015].

- **Frontoparietal network**: Reduced connectivity underlies executive dysfunction and working memory deficits [^notfound].

- **Thalamocortical dysconnectivity**: Altered thalamo-cortical connectivity disrupts sensory processing and attention [^8f2e3910].

---

## Neurotransmitter system abnormalities

PET and SPECT studies provide direct evidence of neurotransmitter abnormalities:

- **Dopamine system**: Increased striatal dopamine synthesis capacity and release are consistently observed in schizophrenia, correlating with positive symptom severity [^41e35ba5] [^44ec82ca].

- **Glutamate system**: Reduced glutamate levels in frontal cortex and hippocampus support the NMDA receptor hypofunction hypothesis [^f80a908c].

- **GABA system**: Reduced GABAergic inhibition, particularly in cortical interneurons, contributes to excitatory-inhibitory imbalance [^f80a908c].

---

## Clinical implications and limitations

While neuroimaging has significantly advanced our understanding of schizophrenia, **several limitations persist**:

- **Heterogeneity**: Significant inter-individual variability limits the development of reliable diagnostic biomarkers [^5496d5b2] [^944a588e].

- **Specificity**: Imaging abnormalities overlap with other psychiatric disorders, reducing diagnostic specificity [^5f1de7ac].

- **Clinical utility**: No imaging technique currently provides sufficient sensitivity and specificity for routine diagnostic use [^5496d5b2] [^872132ca].

- **Future directions**: Machine learning, multimodal imaging, and integration with genetic data hold promise for developing personalized diagnostic and therapeutic strategies [^123778d3] [^73851364].

---

Neuroimaging has elucidated schizophrenia's neurobiological basis, revealing structural, functional, and neurochemical abnormalities. However, **routine diagnostic use remains limited** by heterogeneity and limited specificity, necessitating further research and integration with other biomarkers.

### Do we have any solid evidence of clinical utility about the pathophysiology of schizophrenia? [^fba92fd0]. World Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

A diagnosis of schizophrenia, as in most of psychiatric practice, is made largely by eliciting symptoms with reference to subjective, albeit operationalized, criteria. This diagnosis then provides some rationale for management. Objective diagnostic and therapeutic tests are much more desirable, provided they are reliably measured and interpreted. Definite advances have been made in our understanding of schizophrenia in recent decades, but there has been little consideration of how this information could be used in clinical practice. We review here the potential utility of the strongest and best replicated risk factors for and manifestations of schizophrenia within clinical, epidemiological, cognitive, blood biomarker and neuroimaging domains. We place particular emphasis on the sensitivity, specificity and predictive power of pathophysiological indices for making a diagnosis, establishing an early diagnosis or predicting treatment response in schizophrenia. We conclude that a number of measures currently available have the potential to increase the rigour of clinical assessments in schizophrenia. We propose that the time has come to more fully evaluate these and other well replicated abnormalities as objective potential diagnostic and prognostic guides, and to steer future clinical, therapeutic and nosological research in this direction.

### Neuroimaging biomarkers in schizophrenia [^5496d5b2]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Schizophrenia is a complex neuropsychiatric syndrome with a heterogeneous genetic, neurobiological, and phenotypic profile. Currently, no objective biological measures-that is, biomarkers-are available to inform diagnostic or treatment decisions. Neuroimaging is well positioned for biomarker development in schizophrenia, as it may capture phenotypic variations in molecular and cellular disease targets, or in brain circuits. These mechanistically based biomarkers may represent a direct measure of the pathophysiological underpinnings of the disease process and thus could serve as true intermediate or surrogate endpoints. Effective biomarkers could validate new treatment targets or pathways, predict response, aid in selection of patients for therapy, determine treatment regimens, and provide a rationale for personalized treatments. In this review, the authors discuss a range of mechanistically plausible neuroimaging biomarker candidates, including dopamine hyperactivity, N -methyl-d-aspartate receptor hypofunction, hippocampal hyperactivity, immune dysregulation, dysconnectivity, and cortical gray matter volume loss. They then focus on the putative neuroimaging biomarkers for disease risk, diagnosis, target engagement, and treatment response in schizophrenia. Finally, they highlight areas of unmet need and discuss strategies to advance biomarker development.

### Strucutural brain imaging at the onset of schizophrenia: what have we learned and what have we missed [^fed564b2]. Psychiatry Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Over the past 50 years, the application of structural neuroimaging techniques to schizophrenia research has added relevant information about the pathophysiology of the disorder. Several lines of investigation gave strong evidence that schizophrenia is associated with multiple subtle brain abnormalities that involve both cerebral grey and white matter volumes and structure. The time of onset and longitudinal course of brain morphological abnormalities support the notion that brain pathology of schizophrenia has a neurodevelopmental component and a progressive course, although several confounders of brain changes should be carefully taken into account. Brain anomalies detected before and close to the onset of schizophrenia are likely to be unrelated to confounders of brain changes such as antipsychotic drug treatment, duration of illness or illicit substance abuse, i.e. they related to the pathological process of the disorder per se. Nonetheless, clinically useful diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers have not derived from neuroimaging studies and this is likely related to the neurobiological heterogeneity of the disorder. Thus, there is the compelling need to set new methodological standards for developing innovative hypothesis-driven studies to overcome what we have missed to date in neuroimaging research in schizophrenia.

### Brain structure in schizophrenia: what do we know and what next? [^944a588e]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2025). High credibility.

Meta-analyses and mega-analyses of structural MRI and diffusion MRI studies in thousands of people with schizophrenia have shown reduced brain volumes and structural connectivity relative to healthy control participants. Some of these structural differences probably present pre-morbidly. Severity of schizophrenia symptoms and cognitive impairment consistently correlate. Convergent findings with different analytical methods show that the results are not artefactual. Post-mortem studies add validity and point to a pathophysiology of reduced neuronal size and dendritic arborisation, which is multifactorial. Structural MRI changes probably occur between being in the at-risk state and the first episode of psychosis, and ongoing reductions in brain volume might be associated with poor outcomes. By the standards of observational epidemiology, some findings are convincing or highly suggestive, but many are only suggestive or weak, and more studies are needed. Progress in scientific understanding and evaluating clinical applications will require clear hypotheses, adequately powered studies, and standardised methods and reporting.

### Schizophrenia, "just the facts": what we know in 2008 part 3: neurobiology [^f452e771]. Schizophrenia Research (2008). Low credibility.

Investigating the neurobiological basis of schizophrenia is a critical step toward establishing its diagnostic validity, predicting outcome, delineating causative mechanisms and identifying objective targets for treatment research. Over the past two decades, there have been several advances in this field, principally related to developments in neuroimaging, electrophysiological and neuropathological approaches. Several neurobiological alterations in domains of brain structure, physiology and neurochemistry have been documented that may reflect diverse pathophysiological pathways from the "genome to the phenome". While none of the observed abnormalities are likely to qualify as diagnostic markers at this time, many can serve as potential intermediate phenotypes for elucidating etiological factors including susceptibility genes, and as therapeutic targets for novel drug discovery. Despite several challenges including the substantial phenotypic, pathophysiologic and etiological heterogeneity of schizophrenia, technological limitations, and the less than ideal animal models, considerable progress has been made in characterizing the neurobiological substrate of schizophrenia. The accumulating fact-base on the neurobiology of schizophrenia calls for novel integrative model(s) that may generate new, testable predictions.

### Phenotype of schizophrenia: a review and formulation [^c6601869]. Molecular Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

The discovery of the pathophysiology(ies) for schizophrenia is necessary to direct rational treatment directions for this brain disorder. Firm knowledge about this illness is limited to areas of phenomenology, clinical electrophysiology, and genetic risk; some aspects of dopamine pharmacology, cognitive symptoms, and risk genes are known. Basic questions remain about diagnostic heterogeneity, tissue neurochemistry, and in vivo brain function. It is an illness ripe for molecular characterization using a rational approach with a confirmatory strategy; drug discovery based on knowledge is the only way to advance fully effective treatments. This paper reviews the status of general knowledge in this area and proposes an approach to discovery, including identifying brain regions of dysfunction and subsequent localized, hypothesis-driven molecular screening.

### Can structural neuroimaging be used to define phenotypes and course of schizophrenia? [^01b4a753]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

This article examines whether structural neuroimaging measures have been found to predict outcome in schizophrenia and whether changes in neuroimaging measures have been found to correlate with poor outcome in the disorder. Overall, there is little compelling evidence that structural neuroimaging measures in either first-episode or chronic patients predict future outcome. Progressive brain changes might reflect a neuroimaging phenotype associated with a worse course of the disorder. At the same time, there are many fruitful avenues that future research could take in an attempt to better predict future outcome or to identify specific imaging phenotypes associated with outcome.

### Schizophrenia [^8b7b6e3f]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

Arguably the greatest challenge facing future research into aetiology, pathogenesis and treatment is the failure of current syndromic definitions to delineate a valid disease entity. If research is to progress, we will need new approaches to patient stratification that recognize the varying degree of overlap between syndromes and which bring modern neuroscience to bear on intermediate phenotypes that index the pathophysiology underlying the various clinical features and impairments. Given the complex and variable clinical features and cognitive impairments associated with the disorder it seems likely that multiple brain systems are impacted to varying extents in different individuals and it would be unwise to expect to implicate dysfunction of a single brain region or circuit that accounts for the full range of features of the disorder and which distinguishes it from other disorders. Rather we should expect that different features of the disorder reflect underlying disturbances of different brain functions and moreover that these will cross current diagnostic boundaries. These considerations also imply that we should expect that novel treatments will target particular symptoms or groups of symptoms sharing common underlying mechanisms and that they will be applicable across diagnostic groups.

### Can neuroimaging be used to predict the onset of psychosis? [^c6756c34]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2015). Medium credibility.

The onset of psychotic disorders is preceded by a high-risk phase characterised by attenuated or brief psychotic symptoms and a marked decline in functioning. About a third of individuals presenting with these features develop a psychotic disorder within 3 years. A fundamental challenge in the clinical management of this population is that it is not possible to predict whether an individual at high risk will go on to develop psychosis on the basis of their presenting features. Consequently, preventive interventions that might reduce the risk of progression to psychosis cannot be selectively offered to those patients for whom they would be most useful. However, neuroimaging investigation suggests that the structure, function, and chemistry of the brain in high-risk individuals who become psychotic differ from those in individuals who do not become psychotic. In this Personal View, we review these findings and discuss the main challenges for translating them into clinical practice. The development of techniques that allow clinicians to tailor interventions to the level of risk is a major translational goal for research in this field.

### Subtyping schizophrenia via machine learning by using structural neuroimaging [^123778d3]. Translational Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Schizophrenia is a heterogeneous disorder with diverse clinical presentations and neuroanatomical alterations. Despite recent advances, we still lack a working hypothesis for the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. One reason might be the heterogeneous neuroanatomy of the patients. Data-driven approaches leveraging structural neuroimaging and machine learning have emerged as transformative tools for unraveling this enigma. Recent studies employing advanced clustering techniques have identified robust neuroanatomical subtypes independent of traditional symptom-based frameworks. These data-driven methods reveal distinct cortical and subcortical patterns, aligning with disease progression variations, cognitive function, and treatment outcomes. Novel trajectory-based models suggest that schizophrenia may originate from distinct neuroanatomical regions and follow divergent paths of progression, emphasizing the importance of understanding these patterns in the context of disease staging. These findings provide a foundation for improving diagnostic precision, understanding disease mechanisms, and tailoring interventions. Validation with longitudinal data and standardized methods is crucial for translating these insights into clinical practice and personalized treatments.

### Recognition and differential diagnosis of psychosis in primary care [^338b02cb]. American Family Physician (2015). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for schizophrenia, more specifically with respect to brain imaging, AAFP 2015 guidelines recommend to reserve brain imaging in the evaluation of psychosis for patients with new, severe, unremitting headache, focal neurologic deficits, or a history of recent significant head trauma.

### From maps to mechanisms through neuroimaging of schizophrenia [^aab67965]. Nature (2010). Excellent credibility.

Functional and structural brain imaging has identified neural and neurotransmitter systems involved in schizophrenia and their link to cognitive and behavioural disturbances such as psychosis. Mapping such abnormalities in patients, however, cannot fully capture the strong neurodevelopmental component of schizophrenia that pre-dates manifest illness. A recent strategy to address this issue has been to focus on mechanisms of disease risk. Imaging genetics techniques have made it possible to define neural systems that mediate heritable risk linked to candidate and genome-wide-supported common variants, and mechanisms for environmental risk and gene-environment interactions are emerging. Characterizing the neural risk architecture of schizophrenia provides a translational research strategy for future treatments.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for schizophrenia, more specifically with respect to brain imaging, DoD/VA 2023 guidelines recommend to insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the use of MRI-based prediction systems to identify patients at risk for transitioning to psychosis in cases of suspected psychosis.

### Update on PET imaging biomarkers in the diagnosis of neuropsychiatric disorders [^aec6258a]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To give an update on recent imaging studies probing positron emission tomography (PET) as a tool for improving biomarker-guided diagnosis of neuropsychiatric disorders.

Recent Findings

Several studies confirmed the value of imaging of regional neuronal activity and imaging of dopaminergic, serotonergic, and other neuroreceptor function in the diagnostic process of neuropsychiatric disorders, particularly schizophrenia, depression/bipolar disorder, substance use disorders, obsessive compulsive disorders (OCD), and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Additionally, imaging brain microglial activation using translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO) radiotracer allows for unique in-vivo insights into pathophysiological neuroinflammatory changes underlying schizophrenia, affective disorders, and OCD.

Summary

The role of PET imaging in the biomarker-guided diagnostic process of neuropsychiatric disorders has been increasingly acknowledged in recent years. Future prospective studies are needed to define the value of PET imaging for diagnosis, treatment decisions, and prognosis in neuropsychiatric disorders.

### Corticolimbic circuitry as a druggable target in schizophrenia spectrum disorders: a narrative review [^66984a5e]. Translational Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The progress that has been made in understanding the role of the corticolimbic system in SSD holds great promise for future successful translation of treatments. Further research to better understand why many of the novel compounds have failed and the role of illness stage and prior treatment exposure will be essential to progressing drug discovery. Combining multiple modalities to examine the same hypotheses can help to increase our understanding of the neuropathological processes within the corticolimbic system. For instance, utilising neuroimaging across species can explore homology between circuits and validate theories via back translation. The combination of neuroimaging measures with experimental interventions can substantially improve our understanding of how molecular modulation influences wider corticolimbic function and behaviour/symptomatology. Large-scale consortia afford the power needed to use multivariate data-driven methods and normative modelling to make inferences at the individual level. Increasing our knowledge of biomarkers and their use to stratify patient samples will also be integral to moving towards a precision medicine approach in SSD.

### Discovery of early schizophrenia through neuroimaging [^ac816a6f]. Psychiatry Research (2023). Medium credibility.

In order to understand the pathophysiology of schizophrenia we carried out a number of brain imaging studies in both medicated and unmedicated patients. In addition, to help unravel the pathophysiological mechanisms without the confound of prior exposure to antipsychotic medication or chronicity, we enrolled a large group of antipsychotic medication-naïve first episode psychosis patients at first treatment contact, and performed longitudinal multimodal neuroimaging studies over several months. In unmedicated patients we found both functional and structural connectivity alterations. Similarly, in medication-naïve patients we replicated many of our prior findings, suggesting that functional and structural connectivity alterations are core pathological features of the illness. We found that a longer duration of untreated psychosis, i.e. the time between first symptom onset and initial treatment contact, was associated with greater structural and functional connectivity abnormalities, which in turn was associated with worse subsequent clinical response to treatment. These results underscore the critical importance of early identification and treatment in patients with psychosis spectrum disorders.

### The challenges and promise of neuroimaging in psychiatry [^7bb19726]. Neuron (2012). Low credibility.

Neuroimaging is central to the quest for a biological foundation of psychiatric diagnosis but so far has not yielded clinically relevant biomarkers for mental disorders. This review addresses potential reasons for this limitation and discusses refinements of paradigms and analytic techniques that may yield improved diagnostic and prognostic accuracy. Neuroimaging can also be used to probe genetically defined biological pathways underlying mental disorders, for example through the genetic imaging of variants discovered in genome-wide association studies. These approaches may ultimately reveal mechanisms through which genes contribute to psychiatric symptoms and how pharmacological and psychological interventions exert their effects.

### Corticolimbic circuitry as a druggable target in schizophrenia spectrum disorders: a narrative review [^d128ec7d]. Translational Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD) involve disturbances in the integration of perception, emotion and cognition. The corticolimbic system is an interacting set of cortical and subcortical brain regions critically involved in this process. Understanding how neural circuitry and molecular mechanisms within this corticolimbic system may contribute to the development of not only positive symptoms but also negative and cognitive deficits in SSD has been a recent focus of intense research, as the latter are not adequately treated by current antipsychotic medications and are more strongly associated with poorer functioning and long-term outcomes. This review synthesises recent developments examining corticolimbic dysfunction in the pathophysiology of SSD, with a focus on neuroimaging advances and related novel methodologies that enable the integration of data across different scales. We then integrate how these findings may inform the identification of novel therapeutic and preventive targets for SSD symptomatology. A range of pharmacological interventions have shown initial promise in correcting corticolimbic dysfunction and improving negative, cognitive and treatment-resistant symptoms. We discuss current challenges and opportunities for improving the still limited translation of these research findings into clinical practice. We argue how our knowledge of the role of corticolimbic dysfunction can be improved by combining multiple research modalities to examine hypotheses across different spatial and temporal scales, combining neuroimaging with experimental interventions and utilising large-scale consortia to advance biomarker identification. Translation of these findings into clinical practice will be aided by consideration of optimal intervention timings, biomarker-led patient stratification, and the development of more selective medications.

### Corticolimbic circuitry as a druggable target in schizophrenia spectrum disorders: a narrative review [^d5bd2e03]. Translational Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

To achieve a better understanding of the mechanisms leading to positive, negative and cognitive symptom manifestations, this review synthesises recent developments in the study of corticolimbic dysfunction in the pathophysiology of SSD with a focus on neuroimaging advances and approaches to bridge evidence across different scales of description (cellular/molecular, circuit, whole-brain imaging and behaviour). Finally, the discussion addresses how these methodologies and findings can be leveraged to inform the identification of novel therapeutic and preventative targets in SSD.

### Schizophrenia: from neurochemistry to circuits, symptoms and treatments [^f80a908c]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2024). High credibility.

Schizophrenia is a leading cause of global disability. Current pharmacotherapy for the disease predominantly uses one mechanism - dopamine D2 receptor blockade - but often shows limited efficacy and poor tolerability. These limitations highlight the need to better understand the aetiology of the disease to aid the development of alternative therapeutic approaches. Here, we review the latest meta-analyses and other findings on the neurobiology of prodromal, first-episode and chronic schizophrenia, and the link to psychotic symptoms, focusing on imaging evidence from people with the disorder. This evidence demonstrates regionally specific neurotransmitter alterations, including higher glutamate and dopamine measures in the basal ganglia, and lower glutamate, dopamine and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels in cortical regions, particularly the frontal cortex, relative to healthy individuals. We consider how dysfunction in cortico-thalamo-striatal-midbrain circuits might alter brain information processing to underlie psychotic symptoms. Finally, we discuss the implications of these findings for developing new, mechanistically based treatments and precision medicine for psychotic symptoms, as well as negative and cognitive symptoms.

### Latent clinical-anatomical dimensions of schizophrenia [^d04bb7d7]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Schizophrenia is characterized by heterogeneous clinical manifestations, including positive symptoms, negative symptoms, and generalized cognitive impairments. This complex clinical pattern is already prevalent prior to and during first-episode psychosis. While positive symptoms tend to reduce over time, negative and cognitive symptoms are more likely to persist over time, severely affecting long-term social functioning and quality of life.

Convergent findings from neuroimaging link clinical manifestations of schizophrenia with widespread disruption of structural and functional brain networks. Several large-scale studies and meta-analyses provide evidence for widespread anatomical alterations, including reduced cortical thickness, subcortical volume, and white matter integrity. These localized brain abnormalities have individually been linked to clinical manifestations of positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms.

But how do complex clinical phenotypes map onto distributed brain networks? The organization of brain connectivity increases the likelihood that local pathological perturbations affect synaptically connected neuronal populations. Thus, structural abnormalities with a distributed topography may reflect the underlying network architecture and manifest as a diverse set of cognitive and affective symptoms. Recent studies have demonstrated such links between brain structure and function both in healthy controls, and across a number of neurological and psychiatric diseases.

### Hippocampal dysfunction in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia: a selective review and hypothesis for early detection and intervention [^c29b3fdb]. Molecular Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Diagnostic biomarker

Our aim was to elucidate the pathophysiologic mechanism leading to the onset of schizophrenia and develop a pharmacologic intervention. We began by developing a biomarker to facilitate the diagnosis of people at clinical high risk for psychotic disorders. We focused on the hippocampus because previous neuroimaging research has demonstrated structural (volume reduction, shape anomalies) and functional abnormalities (increased metabolism measured by blood flow and glucose metabolism) in the medial temporal lobe structures of patients with schizophrenia (specifically the CA1 and subiculum subregions of the anterior hippocampus).– The overlap between the anatomical pattern of hippocampal hypermetabolism and structural changes suggested that these abnormalities might stem from a common pathophysiologic mechanism. However, as these findings came from different studies with separate patient samples, their concordance within subjects was unknown. Moreover, the temporal sequence of these pathologic features and whether they are progressive was unclear.

### Functional magnetic resonance imaging in schizophrenia: current evidence, methodological advances, limitations and future directions [^98df7507]. World Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Functional neuroimaging emerged with great promise and has provided fundamental insights into the neurobiology of schizophrenia. However, it has faced challenges and criticisms, most notably a lack of clinical translation. This paper provides a comprehensive review and critical summary of the literature on functional neuroimaging, in particular functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), in schizophrenia. We begin by reviewing research on fMRI biomarkers in schizophrenia and the clinical high risk phase through a historical lens, moving from case-control regional brain activation to global connectivity and advanced analytical approaches, and more recent machine learning algorithms to identify predictive neuroimaging features. Findings from fMRI studies of negative symptoms as well as of neurocognitive and social cognitive deficits are then reviewed. Functional neural markers of these symptoms and deficits may represent promising treatment targets in schizophrenia. Next, we summarize fMRI research related to antipsychotic medication, psychotherapy and psychosocial interventions, and neurostimulation, including treatment response and resistance, therapeutic mechanisms, and treatment targeting. We also review the utility of fMRI and data-driven approaches to dissect the heterogeneity of schizophrenia, moving beyond case-control comparisons, as well as methodological considerations and advances, including consortia and precision fMRI. Lastly, limitations and future directions of research in the field are discussed. Our comprehensive review suggests that, in order for fMRI to be clinically useful in the care of patients with schizophrenia, research should address potentially actionable clinical decisions that are routine in schizophrenia treatment, such as which antipsychotic should be prescribed or whether a given patient is likely to have persistent functional impairment. The potential clinical utility of fMRI is influenced by and must be weighed against cost and accessibility factors. Future evaluations of the utility of fMRI in prognostic and treatment response studies may consider including a health economics analysis.

### Association between retinal features from multimodal imaging and schizophrenia… [^b2477832]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Question Do individuals with schizophrenia have measurable differences in retinal morphology. Findings In this cross-sectional analysis of a cohort of data for 101 416 patients, those with schizophrenia had significantly thinner ganglion cell–inner plexiform layers. Retinovascular differences were mostly attributable to higher medical comorbidity among patients with schizophrenia. Main Outcomes and Measures Retinovascular and optic nerve indices were computed from color fundus photography. Macular retinal nerve fiber layer and ganglion cell–inner plexiform layer thicknesses were extracted from optical coherence tomography. Linear mixed-effects models were used to examine the association between schizophrenia and retinal biomarkers.

In addition, shared characteristics between retinal vascular morphology and other microvascular systems, such as those found in the heart, kidney, and brain, reinforce the hypothesis that retinal imaging–based oculomics can stratify individuals by risk of cardiovascular disease, kidney failure, and cerebrovascular disease. 11–16 Retinal changes have also been observed in individuals with schizophrenia. Two recent meta-analyses concluded that there was evidence for thinner peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer and macular ganglion cell and inner plexiform layer and enlarged cup-disc ratio but acknowledged an inconsistency in results and low statistical power. 17, 18 For example, across 6 reports, significant mGC-IPL thinning was found in schizophrenia but only when evaluating right eyes. We additionally investigated whether retinal vascular morphology differed in patients with schizophrenia.

The dependent variables were retinal morphological features derived from macula-centered color fundus photography and optical coherence tomography. OCT is a noncontact imaging modality that measures back-scattered light and echo time delay to generate cross-sectional images of tissue with histological-like resolution. On unadjusted analysis, individuals with schizophrenia had significantly reduced fractal dimension, vessel density, and tortuosity density and increased arteriolar and venular caliber. In addition, they had reduced mGC-IPL and RNFL thickness. The schizophrenia group had slightly larger mean CDR but a similar prevalence of glaucoma.

### In vivo reactive astrocyte imaging in patients with schizophrenia using [18F] THK5351… [^2beb9715]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Meaning Considering the role of astrocytes in brain development, neurotransmission, and immune reactions, reactive astrocytes in the bilateral anterior cingulate cortex and left hippocampus may be strong biomarkers for schizophrenia pathophysiology and treatment. Importance In vivo imaging studies of reactive astrocytes are crucial for understanding the pathophysiology of schizophrenia because astrocytes play a critical role in glutamate imbalance and neuroinflammation., the baseline hippocampal glutamate level was suggested to be associated with the transition to psychotic disorder. 14 In vivo microglial imaging studies using 18-kDa translocator protein positron emission tomography to detect neuroinflammation in the frontal cortex, ACC, temporal cortex, and hippocampus of patients with schizophrenia have also provided inconsistent results.

15–18 These inconsistencies may be due to the simple approach of using individual glutamate or neuroinflammation markers in a rather complex, mutually influencing system. -21 Reactive astrocytes are remodeled in response to injury, disease, or infection of the brain and can be measured in vivo by detecting overexpressed monoamine oxidase B on the outer mitochondrial membrane. 22 In patients with schizophrenia, abnormal astrocyte-neuronal interactions have been suggested to be the mechanism of psychotic symptom development, 2 and alterations in the expression of astrocyte-related genes and their products in patients' postmortem brains have been reported. 23 However, in vivo reactive astrocyte imaging has not yet been reported in patients with schizophrenia.

In this study, we investigated in vivo reactive astrocyte imaging using MAO-B–binding THK5351 PET to reveal the role of reactive astrocytes, which are involved in both glutamate imbalance and neuroinflammation, in schizophrenia pathophysiology. Patients with schizophrenia had elevated SUVrs in the bilateral ACC and left hippocampus compared with healthy controls. In addition, positive correlations between the SUVrs in the bilateral ACC and the PANSS-positive symptom scores were found in patients with schizophrenia. There were trend-level group differences in the SUVrs in other limbic regions investigated as secondary ROIs. The results of this study not only provide in vivo neuroimaging evidence of the role of reactive astrocytes in schizophrenia pathophysiology but also highlight the region-specific association between reactive astrocytes in the ACC and positive symptoms in patients with schizophrenia.

### Structural and functional imaging markers for susceptibility to psychosis [^19d3236e]. Molecular Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Individuals meeting high-risk criteria are at substantially higher risk for developing a psychotic disorder compared with the general population. Most transitions occur within 2–3 years from initial assessment and result in a schizophrenia spectrum disorder. However, with a sensitivity of 96% but only modest specificity of 47%, clinical high-risk criteria are more useful for excluding, rather than predicting, a future outcome of psychosis. About two-thirds of individuals meeting high-risk criteria will not develop a psychotic disorder; accordingly, there is substantial criticism to the psychosis high-risk paradigm, pointing out issues such as the lack of prognostic precision, specificity for psychosis, and the potential for unnecessary (self-)stigmatization and unindicated antipsychotic drug treatment in individuals receiving a diagnosis of high psychosis risk.

Given the above limitations of clinical high-risk criteria, there have been intensive efforts to improve specificity and predictive accuracy with respect to transition to psychosis using individual symptom profiles, demographic, or cognitive variables. In this context, structural and functional neuroimaging have received growing attention as a potentially useful resource in the prediction of psychotic transitions, as psychotic disorders are linked to several well-established abnormalities of brain structure and function. It is expected that neuroimaging can complement clinical judgment by providing standardized, objective biomarkers for predicting transition in high-risk individuals. The present review summarizes current research on neuroimaging biomarkers with a particular focus on their prognostic utility and limitations.

### Magnetic resonance imaging and the prediction of outcome in first-episode schizophrenia: a review of current evidence and directions for future research [^7adf7df4]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2015). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) measures are promising outcome markers for schizophrenia, since regional frontal and temporal grey matter volumes reductions, and enlargement of the ventricles, have been associated with outcome in this disorder. However, a number of methodological issues have limited the potential clinical utility of these findings. This article reviewed studies that examined brain structure at illness onset as a predictor of outcome, discusses the limitations of the findings, and highlights the challenges that would need to be addressed if structural data are to inform the management of an individual patient.

Methods

Using a set of a priori criteria, we systematically searched Medline and EMBASE databases for articles evaluating brain structure at the time of the first psychotic episode and assessed response to treatment, symptomatic outcome, or functional outcome at any point in the first 12 months of illness.

Results

The 11 studies identified suggest that alterations in medial temporal and prefrontal cortical areas, and in the networks that connect them with subcortical structures, are promising neuroanatomical markers of poor symptomatic and functional outcomes.

Conclusion

Neuroimaging data, possibly in combination with other biomarkers of disease, could help stratifying patients with psychoses to generate patient clusters clinically meaningful, and useful to detect true therapeutic effects in clinical trials. Optimization of Treatment and Management of Schizophrenia in Europe (OPTiMiSE), a large multicenter study funded by the FP7 European Commission, could generate these much-needed findings.

### Brain volume changes in first-episode schizophrenia… [^6099078c]. JAMA Network (2002). Excellent credibility.

BRAIN IMAGING studies have consistently demonstrated brain abnormalities in patients with schizophrenia. 1 These changes are largely confined to decreases in gray matter volumes and enlargement of the lateral and third ventricles. 2, 3 Although the origin of schizophrenia is still unknown, schizophrenia has recently been considered to result in part from abnormalities in neurodevelopment. In patients with chronic schizophrenia, prospective studies using computed tomography and MRI have found that lateral ventricle volume increases26, 29, 36 and temporal and frontal lobe gray matter volume decreases36 over time. Global gray matter volume has only been examined prospectively in childhood-onset schizophrenia. A progressive decline in gray matter volume has been found in this rare form of the disorder.

32 Thus, longitudinal imaging studies suggest that neurodegenerative processes or progressive abnormalities in neurodevelopment can not be dismissed as possible pathogenic mechanisms in schizophrenia. 17–20. Magnetic resonance images were acquired with a Philips NT scanner operating at

1. 5 T. All images were coded to ensure blindness for subject identification and diagnosis; scans were put into Talairach frame 49 and corrected for inhomogeneities in the magnetic field. 50 Intracranial, total brain, cerebral gray and white matter, lateral ventricle, third ventricle, and cerebellum volumes were then automatically measured with histogram analysis algorithms and a series of mathematical morphological operators to connect all voxels of interest. 51–53 Intracranial volume was segmented on the dual-contrast turbo spin-echo scans.

Using mathematical morphological operators the intracranial volumes were segmented automatically, with the foramen magnum being used as the inferior boundary. The dual-contrast turbo spin-echo scans and the intracranial region segmentations on them were registered to the 3-dimensional FFE images using a mutual information maximization algorithm. 51 The 3-dimensional FFE images were masked with the binary intracranial volumes. This was done to remove tissues such as extracranial fat. Total brain volumes were segmented on the T1-weighted scans and contained gray and white matter tissue only. Gray and white matter segmentation was done based on intensity histogram shape analysis of the 3-dimensional FFE images and had been calibrated and validated on a set of 80 human brain images. 52 In lateral ventricle segmentation, automatic decision rules bridged connections that were not detectable and prevented "leaking" into cisterns.

### Application of positron emission tomography in psychiatry-methodological developments and future directions [^7b734093]. Translational Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

In a given year, one out of six individuals in Europe will suffer from a mental health problem, and it is estimated that the total cost to European societies for these disorders is 600 billion euros. Recovery rates for schizophrenia have not improved for several decades, and similarly the global disease burden of depressive and anxiety disorders, both ranked among the top 25 leading causes of burden, has not diminished since 1990. Importantly, the identification of new treatment approaches that could improve this situation is hampered by a lack of understanding of the pathophysiology of mental disorders. Molecular imaging methods such as positron emission tomography (PET) offer a unique opportunity to measure brain biochemical markers in vivo, and have since their advent in the 1980:s been considered a key approach to advance the field.

Psychiatry was indeed an early focus in the field of quantitative PET, with the very first clinical studies being conducted in patients with schizophrenia. Demonstrations of the antipsychotic mechanism of action using dopamine D2 receptor (D2-R) radioligands such as [11 C]raclopride was followed by a series of occupancy studies outlining thresholds for treatment efficacy and side effects. Arguably, the resulting change in dosing regimens remains the most significant contribution of PET research to clinical psychiatry to date. Since then, a wealth of studies have attempted to investigate the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders, mainly based on disease models involving monoamine neurotransmission systems. To name a few examples, studies of dopaminergic function in psychosis and schizophrenia have collectively shown increased dopamine synthesis and release capacity as indexed by increased [18 F]DOPA uptake and more pronounced amphetamine-induced decreases in D2-R receptor binding, a small increase in striatal D2-R availability and lower D2-R availability in the thalamus. In major depressive disorder (MDD), findings point to reduced serotonin transporter and serotonin 1A receptor (5HT1A-R) availability, whereas in patients with anxiety disorders the evidence suggests decreases in 5HT1A and benzodiazepine receptors. Several new radioligands for monoaminergic neurotransmission targets have been developed in recent years, such as tracers with increased sensitivity for endogenous neurotransmitter levels, that may further advance our understanding of the involvement of these systems. However, thus far this line of research has not led to new diagnostic tools or treatments for clinical use, prompting research based on new models of disease pathophysiology.

### The dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia: version III – the final common pathway [^44ec82ca]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2009). Low credibility.

The dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia has been one of the most enduring ideas in psychiatry. Initially, the emphasis was on a role of hyperdopaminergia in the etiology of schizophrenia (version I), but it was subsequently reconceptualized to specify subcortical hyperdopaminergia with prefrontal hypodopaminergia (version II). However, these hypotheses focused too narrowly on dopamine itself, conflated psychosis and schizophrenia, and predated advances in the genetics, molecular biology, and imaging research in schizophrenia. Since version II, there have been over 6700 articles about dopamine and schizophrenia. We selectively review these data to provide an overview of the 5 critical streams of new evidence: neurochemical imaging studies, genetic evidence, findings on environmental risk factors, research into the extended phenotype, and animal studies. We synthesize this evidence into a new dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia-version III: the final common pathway. This hypothesis seeks to be comprehensive in providing a framework that links risk factors, including pregnancy and obstetric complications, stress and trauma, drug use, and genes, to increased presynaptic striatal dopaminergic function. It explains how a complex array of pathological, positron emission tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and other findings, such as frontotemporal structural and functional abnormalities and cognitive impairments, may converge neurochemically to cause psychosis through aberrant salience and lead to a diagnosis of schizophrenia. The hypothesis has one major implication for treatment approaches. Current treatments are acting downstream of the critical neurotransmitter abnormality. Future drug development and research into etiopathogenesis should focus on identifying and manipulating the upstream factors that converge on the dopaminergic funnel point.

### Cerebellar-cortical dysfunction and schizophrenia: advances in neurocognition and therapeutic strategies [^bab72676]. Schizophrenia Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Schizophrenia imposes a global health burden characterized by treatment-refractory cognitive deficits, with converging evidence implicating cerebellar-cortical circuit dysfunction as a pivotal pathophysiological mechanism. In this review, we focus on the advances from neuroimaging, molecular, and therapeutic studies to elucidate the cerebellum's role in schizophrenia-related cognitive pathology. Particularly, we aim to address the advances across four domains: cognitive subtyping in schizophrenia; cerebellar-cortical connectivity evidenced from anatomical, lesion, and neuroimaging studies; multiscale neuropathology in molecular, cellular, and structural alterations; and emerging therapeutics targeting cerebellar nodes through pharmacological, neuromodulatory, and molecular approaches. Collectively, this work supports the cerebellum's role as a critical hub involved in cognitive pathology of schizophrenia.

### Subtyping schizophrenia via machine learning by using structural neuroimaging [^ea6e9cc1]. Translational Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and National Institutes of Health Biomarkers Working Group, a diagnostic biomarker should have a sensitivity of 80% in detecting a particular psychiatric disorder, a specificity of 80% in distinguishing this disorder from other psychiatric disorders, and a positive predictive value that approaches 90%. As a result, structural MRI data barely meet the criteria needed to serve as a diagnostic biomarker with the methods tested so far. Furthermore, this approach assumes that schizophrenia is a single disease with near-uniform pathology among patients. However, the diverse clinical presentations and variability in brain structure observed in schizophrenia underscore the need to subtype patients based on their symptoms and neuroanatomical features.

### The myth of schizophrenia as a progressive brain disease [^15cff32e]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Schizophrenia is a leading cause of disability worldwide. Kraepelin originally characterized the illness as having a course that led almost inevitably to severe cognitive and behavioral decline, and many clinicians and neuroscientists still consider it to be a progressive brain disease that leads to chronicity and social incapacity. This view has been reinforced by recent neuroimaging studies that have shown supposedly "progressive" changes in brain structure. A progressive neuropathological process would provide a straightforward paradigm to understand the relationship between pathophysiology and a poor illness outcome.

This idea of schizophrenia as a progressive disease of the brain has also been an important part of the rationale for developing early intervention services. Indeed, the notion that psychosis itself may be toxic to the brainprovided a major impetus for programs designed to minimize the duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) in order to prevent further brain tissue loss. However, the widespread development over the past 2 decades of specialized clinical programs to treat young people experiencing a first episode of psychosis (FEP) has also provided new opportunities to evaluate the outcome of the illness together with the course of structural brain differences and cognitive deficits. In this article, we will review the evidence concerning these 3 aspects of the illness in order to evaluate whether it is consistent with the view of schizophrenia as a progressive brain disease.

### Functional brain connectivity phenotypes for schizophrenia drug discovery [^8079336f]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2015). Low credibility.

While our knowledge of the pathophysiology of schizophrenia has increased dramatically, this has not translated into the development of new and improved drugs to treat this disorder. Human brain imaging and electrophysiological studies have provided dramatic new insight into the mechanisms of brain dysfunction in the disease, with a swathe of recent studies highlighting the differences in functional brain network and neural system connectivity present in the disorder. Only recently has the value of applying these approaches in preclinical rodent models relevant to the disorder started to be recognised. Here we highlight recent findings of altered functional brain connectivity in preclinical rodent models and consider their relevance to those alterations seen in the brains of schizophrenia patients. Furthermore, we highlight the potential translational value of using the paradigm of functional brain connectivity phenotypes in the context of preclinical schizophrenia drug discovery, as a means both to understand the mechanisms of brain dysfunction in the disorder and to reduce the current high attrition rate in schizophrenia drug discovery.

### A review of diffusion tensor imaging studies in schizophrenia [^9da8ac46]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2005). Low credibility.

Both post-mortem and neuroimaging studies have contributed significantly to what we know about the brain and schizophrenia. MRI studies of volumetric reduction in several brain regions in schizophrenia have confirmed early speculations that the brain is disordered in schizophrenia. There is also a growing body of evidence suggesting that a disturbance in connectivity between different brain regions, rather than abnormalities within the separate regions themselves, are responsible for the clinical symptoms and cognitive dysfunctions observed in this disorder. Thus an interest in white matter fiber tracts, subserving anatomical connections between distant, as well as proximal, brain regions, is emerging. This interest coincides with the recent advent of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), which makes it possible to evaluate the organization and coherence of white matter fiber tracts. This is an important advance as conventional MRI techniques are insensitive to fiber tract direction and organization, and have not consistently demonstrated white matter abnormalities. DTI may, therefore, provide important new information about neural circuitry, and it is increasingly being used in neuroimaging studies of psychopathological disorders. Of note, in the past five years 18 DTI studies in schizophrenia have been published, most describing white matter abnormalities. Questions still remain, however, regarding what we are measuring that is abnormal in this disease, and how measures obtained using one method correspond to those obtained using other methods? Below we review the basic principles involved in MR-DTI, followed by a review of the different methods used to evaluate diffusion. Finally, we review MR-DTI findings in schizophrenia.

### Structural magnetic resonance imaging markers of susceptibility and transition to schizophrenia: a review of familial and clinical high risk population studies [^7fbe3fe8]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2015). Low credibility.

There is a growing consensus that a symptomatology as complex and heterogeneous as schizophrenia is likely to be produced by widespread perturbations of brain structure, as opposed to isolated deficits in specific brain regions. Structural brain-imaging studies have shown that several features of the brain, such as grey matter, white matter integrity and the morphology of the cortex differ in individuals at high risk of the disorder compared to controls, but to a lesser extent than in patients, suggesting that structural abnormalities may form markers of vulnerability to the disorder. Research has had some success in delineating abnormalities specific to those individuals that transition to psychosis, compared to those at high risk that do not, suggesting that a general risk for the disorder can be distinguished from alterations specific to frank psychosis. In this paper, we review cross-sectional and longitudinal studies of individuals at familial or clinical high risk of the disorder. We conclude that the search for reliable markers of schizophrenia is likely to be enhanced by methods which amalgamate structural neuroimaging data into a coherent framework that takes into account the widespread distribution of brain alterations, and relates this to leading hypotheses of schizophrenia.

### Deciphering the molecular tapestry of schizophrenia: integrating transcriptomics, neuroimaging, and clinical data for precision medicine [^c0a1066f]. Translational Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Schizophrenia, an enigmatic disorder that afflicts millions worldwide, presents an intricate tapestry of psychiatric and cognitive symptoms. The quest to decipher its origins and mechanisms has long been a formidable challenge in neuroscience. Despite a consensus that schizophrenia arises from a complex interplay of genetic susceptibility and environmental influences, substantial progress, the precise etiology and pathophysiology of schizophrenia remain shrouded in mystery, posing significant hurdles for the development of targeted interventions. In this study, we adopt a multidimensional approach to investigate the convergence of transcriptomics, brain function, and clinical manifestations in schizophrenia.

The landscape of schizophrenia research has been dramatically transformed by the acknowledgment of its intricate polygenic nature. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have illuminated the presence of a multitude of risk alleles scattered across the genome, each contributing a cumulative effect to the overall disease susceptibility. This complex genetic architecture, underpinned by the collective influence of numerous genetic variants, many of which reside in non-coding regions, implies a pivotal regulatory function in gene expression. These regulatory elements may be sensitive to environmental stimuli, potentially triggering the cascade of events that culminate in the manifestation of schizophrenia. Coinciding with these genetic insights, neuroimaging technologies have peeled back the layers of schizophrenia to expose an intricate interplay of cognitive-behavioral disturbances and pronounced abnormalities in brain architecture and functionality. Among the most compelling findings are the disruptions within the default mode network (DMN), a network inherently associated with self-referential thought and cognitive processes. These DMN anomalies are intrinsically linked to the cognitive deficits that hallmark the disorder, providing a tantalizing link between brain structure and function and the clinical presentation of schizophrenia. Despite the invaluable contributions of clinical assessments, they often lack the biological resolution necessary to forge a definitive connection between the myriad symptoms of schizophrenia and their underlying pathophysiological substrates. This void underscores the imperative for a cohesive, multidisciplinary research paradigm that synthesizes transcriptional, neuroimaging, and clinical perspectives. The integration of these diverse domains is not merely an academic pursuit but a strategic necessity in the quest to identify robust biomarkers and viable therapeutic targets.

### Anomalous brain gyrification patterns in major psychiatric disorders: a systematic review and transdiagnostic integration [^52f2782e]. Translational Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Anomalous patterns of brain gyrification have been reported in major psychiatric disorders, presumably reflecting their neurodevelopmental pathology. However, previous reports presented conflicting results of patients having hyper-, hypo-, or normal gyrification patterns and lacking in transdiagnostic consideration. In this article, we systematically review previous magnetic resonance imaging studies of brain gyrification in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and autism spectrum disorder at varying illness stages, highlighting the gyral pattern trajectory for each disorder. Patients with each psychiatric disorder may exhibit deviated primary gyri formation under neurodevelopmental genetic control in their fetal life and infancy, and then exhibit higher-order gyral changes due to mechanical stress from active brain changes (e.g., progressive reduction of gray matter volume and white matter integrity) thereafter, representing diversely altered pattern trajectories from those of healthy controls. Based on the patterns of local connectivity and changes in neurodevelopmental gene expression in major psychiatric disorders, we propose an overarching model that spans the diagnoses to explain how deviated gyral pattern trajectories map onto clinical manifestations (e.g., psychosis, mood dysregulation, and cognitive impairments), focusing on the common and distinct gyral pattern changes across the disorders in addition to their correlations with specific clinical features. This comprehensive understanding of the role of brain gyrification pattern on the pathophysiology may help to optimize the prediction and diagnosis of psychiatric disorders using objective biomarkers, as well as provide a novel nosology informed by neural circuits beyond the current descriptive diagnostics.

### Structural and functional imaging markers for susceptibility to psychosis [^ef120ca1]. Molecular Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The past two decades of CHR research were exceptionally productive, leading to substantial insights into illness mechanisms leading to psychotic disorders. Still, several issues need to be addressed to achieve clinical applicability, including standardization of clinical definitions and neuroimaging methods, increased focus on generalizability and replicability, and increased attention to contextual factors such as age and comorbidity. The "second wave" of CHR research we are currently experiencing is characterized by large, multimodal/multicenter studies that make use of advances in computing techniques to generate findings that will be useful for individualized prediction in the context of precision psychiatry.

### Linking polygenic risk of schizophrenia to variation in magnetic resonance imaging brain measures: a comprehensive systematic review [^7b5c50f9]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Schizophrenia is a severe neuropsychiatric disorder, characterized by a substantial genetic component. While the neurobiology of schizophrenia remains largely unestablished, scores of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies over the last three decades demonstrate structural and functional brain differences in individuals with schizophrenia compared to healthy controls. Establishing links between these commonly reported brain abnormalities and the underlying genetic architecture of schizophrenia may accelerate progress toward a mechanistic understanding of this highly complex trait.

The most frequently reported MRI findings in schizophrenia include whole-brain and regional (frontal, temporal, and insula) reductions in cortical volume and thickness, as well as widespread disruptions in structural and functional brain connectivity. Evidence of genetic contributions to these brain alterations stems from three primary sources. First, a recent large-scale analysis in the UK Biobank reported high single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based heritability for volumetric measures (mean of ~40% across brain regions), cortical thickness (mean of ~20% across regions), and resting-state brain function (mean of ~20% across regions and ~5% across connections). Second, brain alterations, including reduced gray matter volume and cortical thickness, as well as alterations in white matter microstructure, have been observed in healthy co-twins of schizophrenia probands, implying shared genetic variance between schizophrenia and its associated brain imaging alterations. Third, several previous studies indicate strong genetic overlap between schizophrenia and features of brain morphology and function.

The SNP-based heritability estimate for schizophrenia suggests that around a third of the genetic liability to schizophrenia is explained by common variants that each confer small increments of risk. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified hundreds of such variant associations with schizophrenia, with the latest GWAS (psychiatric genomics consortium-3) uncovering 287 schizophrenia-associated loci. The cumulative effect of these variants can be summarized into polygenic risk scores (computed as the weighted sum of risk alleles under an additive model) that estimate the overall propensity for schizophrenia as indexed by common frequency variants (sczPRS). This major advance in genetic risk profiling, as well as the availability of data from large databases and consortia has spurred a recent explosion in studies exploring links between sczPRS and overt signatures of illness, including MRI brain measures commonly implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.

### Early and late neurodevelopmental influences in the prodrome to schizophrenia: contributions of genes, environment, and their interactions [^5fbaf134]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2003). Low credibility.

Both early (i.e., pre- and perinatal periods) and late (i.e., adolescent period) neurodevelopmental processes are thought to participate in the etiology and pathophysiology of schizophrenia. However, whether markers of these processes would be expected to predict an imminent onset of psychosis, as is hoped in the current generation of prodromal research programs, depends on whether their disruptions result from genetic factors shared by patients and some of their unaffected relatives, nongenetic factors specific to those who manifest the illness phenotype, or combinations of these sets of influences. Here we present recent work deriving primarily from high-risk and family-study (i.e., "genetic high-risk") designs, which provide a framework for investigating the neural changes that may occur proximally to the initial onset of psychosis. This work indicates that some of the alterations in brain function and structure in schizophrenia are primarily genetically mediated and also appear in some of patients' unaffected first degree relatives, while other alterations are present in individuals who manifest the illness phenotype but not in relatives at genetic risk (Cannon et al. 2002a, 2002c; Van Erp et al. 2002). Whereas the primarily genetically mediated deficits shared by at-risk but nonsymptomatic relatives are not likely to show differential change in the premorbid period and may be necessary but clearly not sufficient for the development of psychotic symptoms, the deficits specific to patients who manifest the illness phenotype are good candidates for marking the neurobiological processes associated with the emergence of psychotic symptoms at the time of schizophrenia onset. Preliminary results from longitudinal studies of individuals ascertained initially in a prodromal (i.e., "clinical high-risk") state appear to be interpretable within this framework. A number of questions arising from this line of inquiry need to be addressed in the current generation of prodromal research programs: To what extent do the neural systems affected by early and late neurodevelopmental influences overlap? Is there likely to be a schizophrenia-related disturbance in the processes associated with adolescent brain maturation, or are these maturational processes themselves intact, participating in psychosis onset only indirectly, by promoting a neurobiological context in which the early neurodevelopmental disturbances can be expressed in psychotic symptoms? What pattern of changes observable from in vivo imaging studies is consistent with a reduction in neuropil volume? We develop a framework for addressing these questions and evaluating their implications for understanding the roles of early and late neurodevelopmental influences in the etiology and pathophysiology of schizophrenia.

### A systematic review of structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging studies on the neurobiology of depressive symptoms in schizophrenia spectrum disorders [^b618fd43]. Schizophrenia (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Depressive symptoms are highly prevalent in individuals with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSDs), with as many as 80% of patients experiencing a depressive episode at some point during their course of illness. Depression and depressive symptoms in SSDs are associated with poorer outcomes, including reduced quality of life, increased burden of disease, and a higher frequency of both self-harm, and suicide. Yet, our understanding and diagnosis of depression and depressive symptoms in individuals with SSDs are limited, with therapeutic options providing little efficacy –.

Diagnosing and treating depression in SSDs has posed a challenge. This complexity entails not only identifying general depressive symptoms but also distinguishing them from comorbid depressive disordersas well as core symptom dimensions of schizophrenia, namely negative symptoms –. While antidepressant medications, the mainstay approach for treating major depressive disorders (MDD), are often prescribed for depression in SSDs, findings from recent reviews revealed minimal to modest clinical improvements. Importantly, findings from the Recovery After an Initial Schizophrenia Episode (RAISE) trial, an early treatment program for first-episode psychosis, suggested that less frequent antidepressant use may be linked to fewer side effects.

### Subtyping schizophrenia via machine learning by using structural neuroimaging [^9dadcced]. Translational Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

This perspective is supported by the findings from neuroimaging studies using other modalities. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) studies have shown that elevated striatal dopamine release correlates with the clinical efficacy of dopamine-blocking antipsychotic drugs. However, this hyperdopaminergic state is not present in all patients. Individuals who show poor response to antipsychotics often exhibit greater glutamatergic abnormalities, particularly in cortical regions. Building on these observations, Howes et al proposed two subtypes of schizophrenia: Type A, characterized by hyperdopaminergia, and Type B, which lacks this feature. Indeed, data-driven subtyping studies discussed in this review have identified distinct cortical and subcortical patterns, which are consistent with findings from PET and MR spectroscopy studies and may be associated with variations in disease pathology, progression, cognitive function, and treatment outcomes. Collectively, these findings lay the groundwork for enhancing diagnostic accuracy, uncovering underlying mechanisms, and developing more personalized interventions.

### Graph convolutional networks reveal network-level functional dysconnectivity in schizophrenia [^99869f1a]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Schizophrenia is a severe mental disorder characterized by delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized thinking, which affects approximately 0.3%–0.7% of the world's population. Given the complex and heterogeneous clinical presentation, diagnosis solely based on clinical observation may lack accuracy and objectivity. Therefore, there is an urgent need to establish reliable diagnostic biomarkers in order to develop personalized treatments within the precision medicine framework.

Previous research on imaging biomarkers has largely focused on single brain regions and localized connectivity. However, the human brain is a highly interconnected network, and the emergence of psychiatric illness is thought to be underpinned by a disruption of normal functional integration among cortical and subcortical regions. Over the past 2 decades, neuroimaging studies have identified widespread functional dysconnectivity in individuals with schizophrenia relative to controls. These findings have led to the conclusion that schizophrenia cannot be explained in terms of localized dysfunction within specific brain areas and is better understood as a disruption of network-level functional organization. The study of functional brain organization has the potential to identify predictive biomarkers for neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders and shed light on their underlying mechanisms.

### Test of the transdiagnostic dopamine hypothesis of psychosis using PET imaging… [^41e35ba5]. JAMA Network (2017). Excellent credibility.

of psychosis in schizophrenia3-9 and psychosis in other disorders. 10 Investigations using positron emission tomography have demonstrated increased striatal dopamine synthesis capacity in schizophrenia. 11 Dopamine synthesis capacity is also elevated in individuals at high clinical risk of psychosis, 12–16 some of whom may develop bipolar affective disorder with psychosis, 17 and in individuals with psychosis in the context of temporal lobe epilepsy. 10 These findings suggest that elevated dopamine synthesis capacity may be transdiagnostic, underlying psychosis across disorders, rather than specific to schizophrenia. The region-of-interest analysis was conducted masked to group status. Our primary end point was the dopamine synthesis capacity in the whole striatum.

In view of evidence that dopaminergic alterations may be more marked in schizophrenia in the associative subdivision of striatum relative to other regions13, 43, 44 and elevated in the substantia nigra, 44 we also conducted secondary analyses of these regions. Voxelwise analysis identified significantly greater Kicer in the bipolar group relative to controls and in the schizophrenia group relative to controls. Relative to controls, the subregional analyses showed significant elevations in all 3 functional striatal subdivisions in the bipolar group but only a suggestion in the associative striatum in the schizophrenia group, with no differences in the substantia nigra for either group. Dopamine synthesis capacity was elevated, with a large effect size, in individuals with bipolar affective disorder and a current or previous psychotic episode compared with healthy controls.

In addition, dopamine synthesis capacity was significantly elevated in the schizophrenia group relative to controls. Moreover, dopamine synthesis capacity was associated with the severity of psychotic symptoms in the bipolar group, explaining 36% of the variance in psychotic symptoms. This relationship remained significant after adjusting for the severity of manic symptoms. We found that dopamine synthesis capacity is elevated in psychotic bipolar affective disorder to a degree similar to that in schizophrenia and is related to the severity of psychotic symptoms. These results extend previous findings that dopamine synthesis capacity is elevated in schizophrenia11 and psychosis associated with temporal lobe epilepsy10 and increases with the onset of psychosis, 15 suggesting that presynaptic dopamine dysfunction is associated with psychosis across diagnostic categories.

### Antipsychotic treatment and the striatum… [^867fa592]. JAMA Network (2015). Excellent credibility.

Main Outcomes and Measures Functional connectivity of striatal regions was examined via functional magnetic resonance imaging using a seed-based approach. Changes in functional connectivity of these seeds were compared with reductions in ratings of psychotic symptoms. Results. Disruptions in corticostriatal circuitry have been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Early proposals linked schizophrenia with decreases in dopamine in the prefrontal cortex and excessive dopamine in the striatum. 1, 2 Although elevated striatal dopamine has been shown in patients with schizophrenia, 3 their unaffected relatives, 4 and individuals who are at risk for developing psychotic symptoms, 5 corticostriatal relationships have also been demonstrated to play a central role in psychosis. Early positron emission tomography work found that the severity of psychotic symptoms correlated with abnormal patterns of blood flow in limbic and prefrontal cortical regions.

6 Studies in schizophrenia using functional magnetic resonance imaging have reported abnormal corticostriatal activation during reward7, 8 and executive processing. 9, 10 Evidence. Our primary hypothesis was that functional connections with cortical regions would be strengthened and normalized as psychotic symptoms resolved, specifically with prefrontal and limbic regions that had been impaired in schizophrenia. To test this hypothesis, we first needed to create functional maps from our HC group at baseline. We hypothesized that our functional maps would replicate the anteroposterior separation of positive and negative striatal correlations previously observed. 22 At baseline, we expected to see frontostriatal decoupling in our patients relative to the HC group, which would then normalize as a function of successful treatment. All functional magnetic resonance imaging exams were conducted on a 3-T scanner.

Further details are provided in the eAppendix in the Supplement. During resting state scanning, participants were asked to close their eyes and instructed not to think of anything in particular. All participants were spoken to between scan sequences to ensure they were not asleep; no behavioral differences were observed between groups during scanning. The present study provided evidence that the efficacy of treatment of psychosis with second-generation antipsychotic medications is associated on a neurophysiological level with alterations in functional corticostriatal circuitry. To the extent that psychosis successfully improves, functional connectivity between the striatum and the prefrontal — as well as limbic regions — are strengthened. These data further characterize the pathophysiology of psychosis and support the role of neuroimaging as a potential biomarker for clinical response.

### Structural brain imaging evidence for multiple pathological processes at different stages of brain development in schizophrenia [^31d2973a]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2005). Low credibility.

The underlying neurobiology of emerging psychotic disorders is not well understood. While there is evidence from structural imaging and other studies supporting the popular notion that schizophrenia arises as a consequence of an "early neurodevelopmental" lesion, more recent findings challenge this notion. Evidence, including our own data, suggests that dynamic brain changes occur during the earliest stages of a psychotic illness, including around the time of transition to illness. In this article we review the available longitudinal and relevant cross-sectional structural neuroimaging studies focusing on both the very early neurodevelopmental markers (pre- or perinatal origin) and the later markers (late neurodevelopmental) around the period of transition to illness. Based on our review of recent findings, we suggest that the onset of psychosis is a time of active brain changes, wherein, for a proportion of individuals, (i) an early (pre- and perinatal) neurodevelopmental lesion renders the brain vulnerable to anomalous late (particularly postpubertal) neurodevelopmental processes, as indicated by evidence for accelerated loss of gray matter and aberrant connectivity particularly in prefrontal regions; and (ii) these anomalous neurodevelopmental processes interact with other causative factors associated with the onset of psychosis (e.g., substance use, stress, and dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function), which together have neuroprogressive sequelae involving medial temporal and orbital prefrontal regions, as suggested by imaging studies around transition to active illness. However, the pathological processes underlying such progressive changes during "late neurodevelopment" remain unclear but may reflect anomalies of synaptic plasticity, abnormal brain maturation, the adverse effects of stress, or other environmental factors. In this context, the features of schizophrenia, including the neuropsychological deficits and behavioral manifestations, can be understood as direct effects of these multiple pathological processes at various neurodevelopmental stages, including genetic and nongenetic etiological factors.

### The psychosis MRI shared data resource (psy-shareD) [^66be7106]. Human Brain Mapping (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Despite decades of research investment, schizophrenia (SCZ) spectrum disorders are still a leading cause of disability (Lopez et al; Chong et al.), representing a huge economic health burden and causing untold suffering for patients and families. Given the societal and economic costs of psychotic illness and the limited efficacy of current treatment options, it is of high strategic importance that we improve our understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms that underlie SCZ spectrum disorders, to inform better detection and stratification and treatment development. Over recent decades neuroimaging research in SCZ and psychosis populations has sought to investigate neuroanatomical markers relative to healthy control (HC) groups. Numerous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies investigating brain structure in SCZ and psychosis risk populations (i.e. clinical risk, familial risk and schizotypy (SZT)) have been funded in the United Kingdom and internationally, progressing our understanding of the neuroanatomical basis of SCZ and of these psychosis risk populations. The first neuroimaging anatomical investigation of patients with SCZ, using CT scans, was published in 1976 (Johnstone et al.), and at the time of writing the current paper, a PubMed search using the terms 'schizophrenia MRI (volume or thickness)' shows that 3241 publications reporting the neuroanatomical basis of SCZ using MRI were published between 1986 and December 2024. Many structural MRI studies have also been published in first episode and psychosis risk populations. However, some single‐site MRI studies have small sample sizes (Button et al.) due to the high costs of MRI, alongside difficulties recruiting patients with SCZ and other psychotic illnesses. In particular, studies in psychosis risk groups often have sample sizes under N = 50 (Luna et al.) due to difficulties in recruiting participants meeting risk criteria. While the field has advanced significantly in recent decades and now recognises the need for enhanced sample sizes, reproducibility issues persist in the literature (Marek et al.) hampering our ability to develop a definitive model of the neuroanatomical basis of SCZ, and the illness's developmental trajectory. Larger samples not only increase power to detect smaller effect sizes, but also allow studies to address the issue of clinical heterogeneity within SCZ (e.g. Chand et al.), which has seriously impeded efforts to uncover a 'common' underlying pathophysiology (Orsolini et al.). Although recent neuroimaging work has begun to address this, through clustering and subgroup analyses (e.g. Jiang et al; Alkan and Evans; Chand et al.), single‐site studies often lack sufficient subgroup numbers to draw reliable inferences, and the larger‐scale, multi‐site analyses have tended to just appraise between‐group differences, rather than attempting to identify neuroanatomical signatures associated with the distinct symptom profiles that exist within patient populations. Increased sample sizes allows profile‐specific inferences to be generated and confirmed through cross‐validation, allowing better translation into potential clinical benefit.

### Positron emission tomography in schizophrenia: a new perspective [^3ed448db]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

PET is an important functional imaging technique that can be used to investigate neurotransmitter receptors and transporters directly by mapping human brain function. PET is increasingly being used greatly to advance our understanding of the neurobiology and pathophysiology of schizophrenia.

Methods

This review focuses on the use of PET tracers and kinetic modeling in identifying regional brain abnormalities and regions associated with cognitive functioning in schizophrenia. A variety of PET tracers have been used to identify brain abnormalities, including (11)C, (15)O-water, (18)F-fallypride, and L-3,4-dihydroxy-6-(18)F-fluorophenylalanine ((18)F-FDOPA).

Results

Some studies have used compartmental modeling to determine tracer binding kinetics. The most consistent findings show a difference in the dopamine content in the prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate gyrus, and hippocampus between healthy controls and patients with schizophrenia. Studies also show a higher density of D(2) receptors in the striatum and neural brain dysconnectivity.

Conclusion

Future investigations integrating clinical, imaging, genetic, and cognitive aspects are warranted to gain a better understanding of the pathophysiology of this disorder.

### Deep multimodal predictome for studying mental disorders [^89e79703]. Human Brain Mapping (2023). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Schizophrenia (SZ) is a psychotic disorder that causes impairment in people's thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. In general, people with SZ interpret reality atypically. Since the mental condition overtly manifests in adolescence and early adulthood, it is also considered a neurodevelopmental disorder (Mäki et al.). People with SZ often experience hallucinations, delusions, social withdrawal, and disordered thinking. These can affect daily functioning and be highly disabling. Early identification of the disorder improves outcomes, and low‐dose antipsychotic medications may delay the onset of full‐blown psychosis (Mäki et al; Martin et al.). However, SZ diagnosis is challenging for a few reasons. First, symptoms vary from person to person and change over time. Moreover, identification primarily depends on the self‐acknowledged behavioral changes in the affected individual. Another reason is that many preclinical symptoms during the prodromal period before a first episode overlap with life changes observed in healthy individuals and those who may develop other psychiatric disorders. Since diagnosis involves ruling out other disorders with similar symptoms, sole dependence on symptoms may be unreliable. Besides, the inferences are strongly modulated by the heterogeneity in the individual's psychological condition and treatment (Aboraya et al; Ward et al; Yassin et al.). Therefore, research to discover the disorder's putative biological or neural substrates, which may contribute to more confident predictions or point to treatment targets, is warranted. SZ has also been linked to widespread variation at genetic loci (Jones & Cannon; Owen et al.). This study aims to develop a flexible approach to link genomics and multimodal neuroimaging data to identify putative biological markers of brain disorders. We use structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI and fMRI) and genome‐wide polymorphism collected from individuals with SZ and controls. We aim to probe the data to discover features (concepts) relevant to the disorder. Clinically, the expected insights could be neural activation patterns, structural aberrations, or genetic modifications. Strategically, we propose a model that can accurately discriminate the subjects to learn these attributes from the data. The urge for a reasonable accuracy is to provide dependable assertion about the pathophysiological mechanisms of the disorder — which result from the attributes learned by the model. Studies provide evidence for linkage between genetic risk factors for SZ and brain functional and structural changes (Passchier et al; Richards et al.). Researchers suggest the shared genetic risk for SZ and SZ‐associated gray matter deficiency (Adhikari et al.). Learning different modalities through a joint learning framework is promising and subject to maximizing the complementarity in the data. This shared learning approach conceivably provides crucial neurogenetic alliances for analyzing SZ. For multimodal learning, it is cardinal to incorporate a rational fusion technique to fuse multiple data modes. The proposed scheme maps the features to a common latent space to ensure a consistent fusion. We studied multiple neural networks to perform the latent space mapping and selected the best fit for each modality.

### Potential metabolite markers of schizophrenia [^0c603de9]. Molecular Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Schizophrenia is a severe mental disorder affecting approximately 0.5–1% of the population worldwide. As one of the most expensive medical illness, schizophrenia represents a serious burden on the health-care system. Clinically, it has heterogeneous presentations, with positive and negative symptoms at different levels of prominence across time and across individuals. The current diagnosis of schizophrenia remains subjective due to its complex spectrum of symptoms, and the mechanism underlying the disease process has yet to be elucidated.

Recent clinical studies suggest that early intervention mitigates progression and improves therapeutic outcomes in the disease. Establishment of biomarkers will enable early disease prevention, and thus improve prognosis. A niacin test proposed to measure reduced membrane arachidonic acid levels was suggested for the diagnosis of schizophrenia in 1980, but has not found its way into clinical use so far owing to its low sensitivity and specificity. Imaging modalities including functional magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography and single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT), although frequently used in the pathological study of schizophrenia, have not been able to offer a diagnostic solution with a high enough sensitivity and specificity. Recently, genetic variants at the major histocompatibility complex locus have been found significantly associated with this disease from several major genome-wide association studies, suggesting an immune component in its pathogenesis. However, genetic research strategies, including linkage, association and genome-wide association studies, have yet to generate applicable genetic biomarkers for schizophrenia.

### Two neuroanatomical signatures in schizophrenia: expression strengths over the first 2 years of treatment and their relationships to neurodevelopmental compromise and antipsychotic treatment [^f1f0e877]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The neurodevelopmental and dopamine (DA) hypotheses are two major theories of schizophrenia that propose to explain the origins and underlying neurobiology of the disorder respectively. These hypotheses are broadly consistent with the proposal over 40 years ago by Crowof two distinct syndromes for schizophrenia, each with a specific pathological process. Crow proposed that "acute schizophrenia" is characterized by positive symptoms and is responsive to antipsychotic medication, while the "defect state" is characterized by negative symptoms, intellectual impairment, a poor long-term outcome and structural brain changes. However, while brain morphological differences have been consistently reported in schizophrenia, attempts to link these changes to both neurodevelopmental compromiseand psychotic symptoms associated with DA dysregulationhave met with limited success. This is not surprising given the heterogeneous nature of the illness with large variation in many aspects including brain structural changes. Additionally, differences in study populations and methodology including scanning protocols and selection of brain regions, likely contribute to the lack of consistent findings. A better understanding of these associations may further elucidate the underlying neurobiology of the illness and provide clinicians with tools for predicting outcome and individualizing treatment.

### A selective review of structural connectivity abnormalities of schizophrenic patients at different stages of the disease [^2e1f29ca]. Schizophrenia Research (2015). Low credibility.

Schizophrenia has long been hypothesized to result from a disconnection syndrome due to a disruption of the association fibers of the brain. However, only with the advent of in vivo neuroimaging, a formal disconnectivity hypothesis for schizophrenia has been developed. Diffusion tensor MRI, a non-invasive technique which is sensitive to features of tissue microstructure and to the anatomy of the white matter fibers, has gained a crucial role in the field. Here, we provide a state-of-the-art review of structural connectivity abnormalities detected in schizophrenia and discuss the most relevant findings at preclinical, first episode drug-naïve, and chronic stages. Imaging studies showed white matter alterations from the preclinical to the chronic stage of the disease, which involve the corticospinal tracts, interhemispheric connections, long association white matter tracts, cerebello-thalamo-cortical circuit, and limbic system. Such abnormalities were found to be associated with the psychiatric and cognitive manifestations of the disease and to predict, at least partially, the patient clinical evolution and response to treatment.

### Hippocampal dysfunction in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia: a selective review and hypothesis for early detection and intervention [^10d1cbed]. Molecular Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

This body of research led to efforts to develop innovative treatment strategies for patients in the early stages of psychotic disorders designed to reduce the duration of untreated illness and promote engagement in sustained treatment and reduce non-adherence and relapse. While current clinical methods are sufficiently robust for diagnosing and effectively treating first episode psychosis patients, thereby establishing a standard of care of this stage of illness, the methodology for subjects suspected of being in the antecedent "prodromal" stages of the schizophrenia — so-called clinical high-risk state — is inadequate for clinical implementation. Our methods for case identification are insufficiently specific, and we do not know what are the optimal treatments for people approaching or at the incipient stage of their illness. Previous studies have shown that at most, 30% of people who met criteria for being at clinical high risk to develop schizophrenia actually go on to develop syndromal psychosis. Thus, the case identification criteria, which represent the state of the art, have the potential for a 70% or higher false positive rate (people identified as clinical high risk but do not develop bona fide psychotic disorders). Therefore, we risk mislabeling and treating them, possibly unnecessarily, to alleviate their attenuated psychotic symptoms and prevent the onset of schizophrenia.

A pathophysiologic hypothesis of schizophrenia onset

To advance our knowledge of psychotic disorders and improve the methodology for early detection and intervention in the presyndromal phase of schizophrenia, we developed a pathophysiologic model that characterizes the progression of schizophrenia from the premorbid through the prodromal stages to syndromal psychosis. This model posits dysregulation of glutamate neurotransmission occurring in the CA1 region of the hippocampus which elevates neuronal activity reflected in metabolism and blood flow, and in doing so elicits attenuated psychotic symptoms and initiates the prodromal stage of schizophrenia. As this persists, it drives the transition process to the later prodromal stage and subsequently syndromal psychosis. As the incipient illness progresses, this dysfunction expands to projection fields within and external to the hippocampus and frontal cortex, and causes an atrophic process in which the neuropil of hippocampal cells is reduced and interneurons are lost. This paper will describe and review the research that underpins this model, hippocampal pathophysiology in the onset of schizophrenia (Supplementary Figure S2). The evidence supporting this model is substantial, consistent and derives from numerous investigators. Our contributions to this body of research began with studies of the pathophysiological progression of schizophrenia –, and more recently on the pathogenic mechanisms of the onset of the illness.

### Neurodevelopmental model of schizophrenia: update 2012 [^77dc675a]. Molecular Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

The neurodevelopmental model of schizophrenia, which posits that the illness is the end state of abnormal neurodevelopmental processes that started years before the illness onset, is widely accepted, and has long been dominant for childhood-onset neuropsychiatric disorders. This selective review updates our 2005 review of recent studies that have impacted, or have the greatest potential to modify or extend, the neurodevelopmental model of schizophrenia. Longitudinal whole-population studies support a dimensional, rather than categorical, concept of psychosis. New studies suggest that placental pathology could be a key measure in future prenatal high-risk studies. Both common and rare genetic variants have proved surprisingly diagnostically nonspecific, and copy number variants (CNVs) associated with schizophrenia are often also associated with autism, epilepsy and intellectual deficiency. Large post-mortem gene expression studies and prospective developmental multi-modal brain imaging studies are providing critical data for future clinical and high-risk developmental brain studies. Whether there can be greater molecular specificity for phenotypic characterization is a subject of current intense study and debate, as is the possibility of neuronal phenotyping using human pluripotent-inducible stem cells. Biological nonspecificity, such as in timing or nature of early brain development, carries the possibility of new targets for broad preventive treatments.

Future Directions

Future work using MRI in schizophrenia-spectrum disorders would benefit from multimodal measures examining both volume and FA on a within-subjects basis. For example, it is unclear what the relationship is between schizophrenia-spectrum abnormalities in the volume of white matter tracts (e.g. the anterior limb of the internal capsule and FA values within the tract). Are smaller-sized tracts associated with higher or lower FA? Also, we need to better understand the cognitive correlates of volume (both gray and white matter) and FA abnormalities across the spectrum. Additional studies that directly compare SPD and schizophrenia are sorely needed in order to better understand how these schizophrenia-spectrum groups both differ and show similarities in terms of gray and white matter abnormalities. Finally, integrating structural MRI and DTI data with genetic data will advance our understanding of the genetic contributions to structural and functional deficits. Combining these methodologies is likely to advance our understanding of the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and shed light on potential protective factors observed in SPD, which in turn may improve treatment and prognosis.

### Elevating the field for applying neuroimaging to individual patients in psychiatry [^73851364]. Translational Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

One challenge for psychiatric neuroimaging is to find ways to integrate multimodal information into a coherent model that describes normative brain-behavior connections while realizing the aims of personalized medicine. The push in recent years to amass large amounts of MRI data for collaborative analytical efforts is a step in the right direction for elucidating biological evidence relevant in psychiatric conditions at scale. But this must be complemented with mechanistically driven studies that allow a unique perspective on individual differences and offer insight into potential treatment. Examples of the latter include, but are not limited to, pharmacological functional MRI (phMRI) and stimulation protocols, before or during MRI. phMRI can be used to target receptor systems using specific drug compounds. Such studies have reported consistent and reproducible changes in relevant functional networks in disease and can detect dose-dependent functional network changes over the short and long term. Recent phMRI studies have targeted neurotransmitter systems, specifically brain glutamate, and serve as an example for parsing our understanding of heterogeneity within clinical conditions and response to treatment. For example, a phMRI investigation examining neural circuit functioning in chronic stable patients with schizophrenia during working memory fMRI found significant changes in striatum and anterior cingulate activation patterns that were attributable to a positive allosteric modulator of mGluR2. Notably, the inclusion of phMRI measures allowed the investigators to target known brain locations affected in schizophrenia, critical for working memory and high in mGluR2 receptor distribution to identify drug effects at the brain level. This specificity allowed the investigators to better understand potential heterogeneity in drug response and suggest the potential of increased mGluR2 signaling to improve disabling symptoms of schizophrenia. More globally, the development of phMRI and other molecular imaging biomarkers can reveal therapeutic mechanisms, which will allow drug development and treatment to be tailored toward specific neural circuits and patient populations. Likewise, the use of noninvasive stimulation protocols (e.g. repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation) in conjunction with 3 T MRI, in particular with magnetic resonance spectroscopy, can also provide convergent mechanistic evidence. As an example, systematic within-subject studies in depression indicate substantial change in neurometabolites, including glutamate and GABA, after short and long-term treatment with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). Larger, longitudinal studies where neural stimulation is coupled with 3 T MRI measures of both neurometabolism and network activity will provide a refined understanding of the influence neural stimulation has on excitatory and inhibitory neurometabolites and may offer support for a potential mechanism of action of this and other treatments. Moreover, it will enable the field to better map trajectories of change with treatment. Approaches like these will enable the field to evaluate early signals of clinical efficacy and build a roadmap for predicting clinical effects, all of which requires greater understanding of both disease and treatment effects on specific neural circuits. These efforts can be employed now at 3 T MRI and will narrow our path toward the goal of personalized medicine with optimal outcomes for every patient. While improvements in 3 T MRI approaches will improve incrementally in the years to come, which improve our ability to relate neuroimaging to behavior, and link improvements to measures of psychopathology, it is likely that the utility of 3 T MRI in psychiatry has reached its asymptote. Yet, other imaging opportunities exist and demand our attention; in particular the prospect of increased MR field strength for generating new discoveries in psychiatry.

### Magnetization transfer imaging alterations and its diagnostic value in antipsychotic-naïve first-episode schizophrenia [^7d4f4707]. Translational Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Schizophrenia, a severe psychiatric illness involving hallucinations, delusions and disorganized thinking, is one of the greatest causes of disability worldwide, affecting about 1% of the world's population. The neurobiology of this complex illness is not well understood. Neuroimaging studies have revealed distributed brain abnormalities in structure and function. However, these findings have been inconsistent, potentially due to the effects of antipsychotic medication and long illness duration in many study samples. Previous studies have primarily focused on volumetric and functional measures, but studying antipsychotic-naïve first-episode schizophrenia (FES) using alternative MRI approaches may be an important strategy for characterizing the neurobiological substrate and identifying useful biological markers.

Widespread structural brain abnormalities have been observed in individuals with schizophrenia. Among many reported brain abnormalities in schizophrenia, the most consistent are in the thalamo-cortical and default mode networks. The macroscopic neuroimaging findings of structural brain abnormalities have been confirmed and to some extent explained by postmortem studies. However, it is difficult to identify in vivo the histopathological alterations that underlie these macroscopic findings. Postmortem alterations point to changes that could be identified with MRI, but that which might be difficult to characterize with standard morphometric imaging. Techniques are needed with sufficient sensitivity to detect subtle neuropathology such as changes in the nature and concentration of macromolecules.

Magnetization transfer imaging (MTI) can provide neuropathologically relevant information in vivo unavailable by conventional T1- and T2-weighted MRI techniques; this is conveniently and reproducibly characterized using the semi-quantitative magnetization transfer ratio (MTR). MTR signals are influenced by macromolecules in brain tissue, which mainly form neuronal cell membranes in gray matter and myelin in white matter and is considered to be a more sensitive measure for distinguishing schizophrenia than conventional MRI measures. Previous schizophrenia studies have found widespread MTR abnormality, e.g. in the frontal, temporal, and occipital regions. However, the sample sizes of these prior studies were relatively small, and the majority of participants at the time of scanning were on antipsychotic medication, so it remains unclear whether the pattern of deficits reported is related to illness itself or to antipsychotic medications that are believed to impact structural alterations. Moreover, most have used region-of-interest methods which risk systematic placement bias.

### The genetic relationships between brain structure and schizophrenia [^d973e513]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have confirmed that human brain structure is heritable, and the number of genetic loci associated with variation in brain phenotypes, typically measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), has increased as the scale of cohorts with both genetic and MRI data available has become larger. Growing insight into the genetic architecture of the human brain raises the question of whether brain structural variation in the population is associated with genes that are also significantly associated with schizophrenia and other neuropsychiatric disorders –. It is a central expectation of many biological theories of schizophrenia that genetic effects on schizophrenia are mechanistically or proximally mediated by the effects of the same genes on brain structure and function; but to date, there has been limited direct evidence for this prediction.

Here, we aimed to identify genes that are associated with both brain MRI phenotypes and schizophrenia. We reasoned that identification of such pleiotropic genes would be consistent with prior theories that genetic variants encode risk for schizophrenia by causal effects on intermediate phenotypes or endophenotypes of brain structure. We recognised that pleiotropic association per se does not resolve the question of causality, and that the theoretically privileged axis — from gene to brain to schizophrenia — is not the only plausible causal pathway between these entities. However, given recently available statistically well-powered GWAS of schizophrenia and brain structure, we reasoned that if we could not find any evidence for pleiotropic association, then the role of macro-scale brain structure in mediating schizophrenia risk must be more modest than previously anticipated.

### Motor dysfunction within the schizophrenia-spectrum: a dimensional step towards an underappreciated domain [^23150a5c]. Schizophrenia Research (2015). Low credibility.

At the beginning of the 20th century, genuine motor abnormalities (GMA) were considered to be intricately linked to schizophrenia. Subsequently, however, GMA have been increasingly regarded as unspecific transdiagnostic phenomena or related to side effects of antipsychotic treatment. Despite possible medication confounds, within the schizophrenia spectrum GMA have been categorized into three broad categories, i.e. neurological soft signs, abnormal involuntary movements and catatonia. Schizophrenia patients show a substantial overlap across a broad range of distinct motor signs and symptoms suggesting a prominent involvement of the motor system in disease pathophysiology. There have been several attempts to increase reliability and validity in diagnosing schizophrenia based on behavior and neurobiology, yet relatively little attention has been paid to the motor domain in the past. Nevertheless, accumulating neuroscientific evidence suggests the possibility of a motor endophenotype in schizophrenia, and that GMA could represent a specific dimension within the schizophrenia-spectrum. Here, we review current neuroimaging research on GMA in schizophrenia with an emphasis on distinct and common mechanisms of brain dysfunction. Based on a dimensional approach we show that multimodal neuroimaging combined with fine-grained clinical examination can result in a comprehensive characterization of structural and functional brain changes that are presumed to underlie core GMA in schizophrenia. We discuss the possibility of a distinct motor domain, together with its implications for future research. Investigating GMA by means of multimodal neuroimaging can essentially contribute at identifying novel and biologically reliable phenotypes in psychiatry.

### Microstructural white matter changes are correlated with the stage of psychiatric illness [^89d8cc80]. Translational Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a new application of MRI that is sensitive to the microstructural organisation of white matter tracts. When reported as fractional anisotropy (FA), it provides insights into the role of structural (dis)connectivity at a much earlier stage of an illness, if not before its onset. Abnormalities to specific white matter tracts are increasingly being investigated as a means of identifying specific pathology, particularly within the early phases of schizophrenia. James et al. identified a decrease in FA among adolescents with schizophrenia relative to healthy controls across multiple structures. Disruptions in white matter connectivity from parietal regions have been observed among children and adolescents following their first episode of schizophrenia, with this differing to that expressed among adults, where the disruptions in connectivity appear to be more diffuse. Comparing the first episode with high-risk groups (that is, prodromal symptoms with no evidence of a psychotic episode), Ota et al. have recently reported brain alterations before illness onset and cited developmental mechanisms for bilateral changes in FA within the temporal lobes in patients.

FA is widely regarded a robust measure of white matter 'organisation' and indeed all of the aforementioned studies have reported abnormalities in FA across both prodromal as well as discrete phases of psychotic and affective illnesses. However, despite a confirmation of significant disruption to white matter integrity, little progress has been made delineating the underlying pathophysiology from measures derived solely from FA. Disruptions in white matter organisation, (as reflected in reductions in FA) can result from various mechanisms, including demyelination as well as discrete loss of axons and as such additional complementary DTI metrics that distinguish between these two mechanisms are essential. In this regard, quantitative measures of parallel (λ//) and radial (λ⊥) diffusivity can also be obtained from DTI, and these measures describe water diffusion along (λ//) or across (λ⊥) the axons, thus providing information thought to reflect the integrity of axons or myelin, respectively. Parallel diffusivity has been shown to be a robust measure of axon numbers and loss of axons are reflected in a decrease in this measure. Conversely, radial diffusivity characterises the diffusion across the myelin and thus disruptions in the myelin sheath are characterised by increased radial diffusivity.

### Neuroimaging studies of GABA in schizophrenia: a systematic review with meta-analysis [^fea7debc]. Translational Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Neuroimaging of GABA function is potentially important because several hypotheses around the role of GABA dysfunction in schizophrenia can only be tested in vivo. Evidence that GABA dysfunction has a role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia has also led to interest in the therapeutic potential of pharmacological compounds that act on GABA function, and data from animal studies suggest that administration of benzodiazepines can prevent the development of neuroanatomical and neurophysiological abnormalities associated with schizophrenia.

Although there have been several neuroimaging studies of GABA in schizophrenia, the nature of GABAergic abnormalities in schizophrenia in vivo remains unclear. The present study aims to address this issue by conducting a systematic review and a meta-analysis of 1 H-MRS and PET/SPECT studies of GABA in schizophrenia. In our primary analyses as well as studies of patients with schizophrenia, we included studies of subjects at high clinical or genetic risk for the disorder, as GABAergic dysfunction may be a 'trait' characteristic, arising through the influences of genetic variation during development. The potential influence of clinical subgroups, medication status, symptom severity, age, and genderwere investigated using subsequent moderator analyses and meta-regression.

### Anatomical abnormalities of the anterior cingulate cortex in schizophrenia: bridging the gap between neuroimaging and neuropathology [^edf8cd54]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2009). Low credibility.

The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is a functionally heterogeneous region involved in diverse cognitive and emotional processes that support goal-directed behaviour. Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and neuropathological findings over the past two decades have converged to suggest abnormalities in the region may represent a neurobiological basis for many of the clinical manifestations of schizophrenia. However, while each approach offers complimentary information that can provide clues regarding underlying patholophysiological processes, the findings from these 2 fields are seldom integrated. In this article, we review structural neuroimaging and neuropathological studies of the ACC, focusing on the unique information they provide. The available imaging data suggest grey matter reductions in the ACC precede psychosis onset in some categories of high-risk individuals, show sub-regional specificity, and may progress with illness duration. The available post-mortem findings indicate these imaging-related changes are accompanied by reductions in neuronal, synaptic, and dendritic density, as well as increased afferent input, suggesting the grey matter differences observed with MRI arise from alterations in both neuronal and non-neuronal tissue compartments. We discuss the potential mechanisms that might facilitate integration of these findings and consider strategies for future research.

### Clinical application of brain imaging for the diagnosis of mood disorders: the current state of play [^872132ca]. Molecular Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

Overview of applications of neuroimaging in psychiatric disorders

The application of neuroimaging technology in psychiatric research has revolutionized clinical neuroscience perspectives on the pathophysiology of the major psychiatric disorders. Research using a variety of types of neuroimaging techniques has shown that these conditions are associated with abnormalities of brain function, structure and receptor pharmacology. These data also corroborate the conclusions reached from genetic, endocrine, and clinical pharmacology research involving these disorders to suggest that under the current nosology the major psychiatric disorders likely reflect heterogenous groups of disorders with respect to pathophysiology and etiology.

Despite the invaluable leads that the neuroimaging studies have provided regarding the neurobiological bases for psychiatric disorders, they have yet to impact significantly the diagnosis or treatment of individual patients. In clinical medicine, considerable interest has existed in developing objective, biologically based tests for psychiatric illnesses. From the clinical perspective, such advances could yield important benefits such as predicting treatment response, differentiating between related diagnostic categories, and potentially treating at-risk patients prophylactically to prevent neurotoxicity and clinical deterioration.

Nevertheless, the effect size of neuroimaging and other biological abnormalities identified to date in psychiatric disorders has been relatively small, such that imaging measures do not provide sufficient specificity and sensitivity to accurately classify individual cases with respect to the presence of a psychiatric illness. This review focuses specifically on the potential clinical utility of biomarkers assessed using modern neuroimaging technologies, and the approach required to validate imaging biomarkers for use as clinical diagnostics.

### Negative symptoms in first-episode schizophrenia related to morphometric alterations in orbitofrontal and superior temporal cortex: the OPTiMiSE study [^4f741dd5]. Psychological Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Our results highlight the role of the alterations in the orbitofrontal and superior temporal cortex in the pathophysiology of negative symptoms in Schizophrenia. There is a pressing need for new treatments for negative symptoms: understanding their neurobiological basis may inform the development of novel therapeutic approaches. The OFC in particular may be a significant biomarker for designing effective clinical trials for negative symptoms. Future studies employing longitudinal designs as well as functional imaging investigating patients from ultra-high risk states to established pre-treatment psychotic illness, are needed to further elucidate and confirm OFC as a potential target for novel treatment developments.

### Topographic diversity of structural connectivity in schizophrenia [^68bba426]. Schizophrenia Research (2020). Medium credibility.

The neurobiological heterogeneity of schizophrenia is widely accepted, but it is unclear how mechanistic differences converge to produce the observed phenotype. Establishing a pathophysiological model that accounts for both neurobiological heterogeneity and phenotypic similarity is essential to inform stratified treatment approaches. In this cross-sectional diffusion tensor imaging study, we recruited 77 healthy controls, and 70 patients with DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia. We first confirmed the heterogeneity in structural connectivity by showing a reduced between-individual similarity of the structural connectivity in patients compared to healthy controls. Second, at a system level, we found the diversity of the topographic distribution of the strength of structural connectivity was significantly reduced in patients (P = 7.21 × 10–7, T 142 = 5.19 [95% CI: 3.37–7.52], Cohen's d = 0.91), and this affected 65 of the 90 brain regions examined (False Discovery Rate < 5%). Third, when topographic diversity was used as a discriminant feature to train a model for classifying patients from controls, it significantly improved the accuracy on an independent sample (T 99 = 5.54; P < 0.001). These findings suggest a highly individualized pattern of structural dysconnectivity underlies the heterogeneity of schizophrenia, but these disruptions likely converge on an emergent common pathway to generate the clinical phenotype of the disorder.

### Dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia: making sense of it all [^1996d8ba]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2007). Low credibility.

The dopamine (DA) hypothesis of schizophrenia has evolved over the last decade from the stage of circumstantial evidence related to clinical observations and empirical validation from antipsychotic treatment to finally reach more direct testing and validation from imaging studies. These have provided much information that allows us at this point to assemble all the pieces and attempt to synthesize them and integrate them with the other neurotransmitter alterations observed in this illness. Although clearly not sufficient to explain the complexity of this disorder, the DA dysregulation offers a direct relationship to symptoms and to their treatment. We will review here its history, validation, and implications for treatment.

### Cortical morphology in patients with the deficit and non-deficit syndrome of schizophrenia: a worldwide meta-and mega-analyses [^97946b13]. Molecular Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Unraveling schizophrenia (SZ) heterogeneity represents a formidable ongoing challenge enforcing the need to examine the neurobiological correlates of specific symptomatology. Since the current nosology likely reflects a group of diseases, discriminating between subtypes of schizophrenia characterized by more homogeneous enduring symptoms may be an effective method for identifying unique neurobiological markers of specific disease entities within the SZ spectrum. A clinically homogeneous subgroup of patients diagnosed with SZ showing primary, stable, and enduring negative symptoms (i.e. Deficit SZ (DSZ)) can be distinguished, representing up to one-third of individuals with SZ. DSZ is characterized by persistent impairment and poorer long-term prognosis with a lower likelihood of recovery compared to Non-Deficit SZ (NDSZ).

Clinical and neurobiological differences between DSZ and NDSZ patients can be identified at the first psychotic episode or even before clinical manifestation. Further evidence suggests that these disease entities differ also in etiologic factors, course, and treatment response. Accordingly, several authors support the hypothesis that DSZ could represent a separate disease within the SZ syndrome.

While the clinical manifestations of DSZ assume distinctive characteristics that have been well-described in prior works, the neural substrates of the disorder are not sufficiently understood. In fact, structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have produced conflicting results. Although some studies reported white matter (WM) and gray matter (GM) abnormalities in DSZ compared to NDSZ, others reported gray matter abnormalities in NDSZ patients only, or no differences between the two patient subgroups.

Given such discordant results, a deeper insight may be gained by shifting the focus from volumetric measures to morphological parameters indexing different aspects of brain architecture. Indeed, cortical GM volume is defined as the product of two morphological indices (i.e. cortical thickness and surface area) and lower volume may reflect either thinner cortex, smaller surface area, or both. Although the exact neurobiological constituents remain unclear, surface area and cortical thickness may be determined by the number and the laminar patterning of cortical columns, respectively, thus providing a biologically relevant decomposition of cortical volume. They show unique regional variations across the cerebral cortex, both at the regional and the whole-brain level, and have largely distinct genetic architectures. Each of these morphometric features shows different age-related trajectories, thus providing diverse information on brain development, and may offer more fundamental insights than comparisons of GM volumes particularly in disorders characterized by neurodevelopmental disturbances.

### Reconfiguration of functional brain hierarchy in schizophrenia [^274f4f3c]. Translational Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Schizophrenia is a severe and often chronic psychiatric disorder characterized by a range of multidimensional symptoms, including positive symptoms, such as hallucinations and delusions, and negative symptoms, such as anhedonia and avolition. The multifaceted nature of schizophrenia is further compounded by fluctuating symptomatology throughout individuals' lives, leading to significant heterogeneity among patients. This complexity and variability require a comprehensive exploration of both the anatomical and functional brain networks.

The presence of neuroanatomical anomalies in both grey and white matter is a well-established phenomenon in schizophrenia. Robust evidence has revealed regionally decreased grey matter in both first-episode and chronic schizophrenia patients, specifically in the frontal lobe, cingulate cortex, the thalamus, insula, post-central gyrus, and medial temporal regions. In terms of white matter alterations, reductions in the corpus callosum, as well as in the frontal and temporal lobes have been extensively documented.

Furthermore, alterations in functional brain dynamics in schizophrenia have been thoroughly reported using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Among the networks considered most relevant are the salience network and the default mode network (DMN). Studies have identified heterogeneous findings, with some indicating hyperconnectivity, while others report hypoconnectivity which can vary across networks.

Despite the numerous identified structural and functional abnormalities, the underlying nature of the pathophysiology remains unclear, emphasizing the need for alternative perspectives and hypotheses. One promising approach to conceptualize these anomalies is to consider these deficits as a disorder of integration of information across brain regions. Information integration can be studied by analysing the level of asymmetry in the interactions among brain regions, that is, the extent to which information is transmitted in a non-reciprocal manner between them. In a symmetrical system, communication between regions is reciprocal, with no dominant directionality, leading to a uniform distribution of information processing. However, this lacks the differentiation needed for hierarchical organisation, where certain regions play specialized or more influential roles in guiding brain function. On the other hand, asymmetrical interactions indicate non-reciprocal communication, where information is integrated in a small group of regions before being transmitted to the others across the whole-brain. This creates a hierarchical arrangement that is indicative of non-equilibrium systems, facilitates distinct processing of specialized functional domains and allows for dynamic configuration and intercommunication among brain regions.

### Prefrontal abnormalities in patients with simple schizophrenia: structural and functional brain-imaging studies in five cases [^66465149]. Psychiatry Research (2005). Low credibility.

Simple schizophrenia is an uncommon disorder with unknown pathophysiology, and its position in the current diagnostic system is ambiguous. Brain-imaging studies may help to elucidate its pathophysiology. Five patients fulfilling both ICD-10 criteria for simple schizophrenia and DSM-IV criteria for simple deteriorative disorder underwent computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and single photon emission computed tomography. These scans were assessed individually by visual inspection as well as automatically by comparison with scans in normal controls or other schizophrenia subtype patients using voxel-based image analyses. Three of the five simple schizophrenia patients had findings of atrophy and reduced cerebral perfusion in the frontal areas. Voxel-based analyses also showed prefrontal grey matter deficits and hypoperfusion in simple schizophrenia patients compared with the controls. Although this study is limited by the small number of patients with simple schizophrenia, the results suggest that simple schizophrenia, or at least this subpopulation, may have rather homogeneous morphological and functional deficits in the prefrontal cortex. It is also suggested that simple schizophrenia may occupy an extreme position of the schizophrenic continuum where the prefrontal deficits and negative symptoms are most purely manifested.

### The neural substrates of neurological soft signs in schizophrenia: a systematic review [^c5611d0b]. Schizophrenia (2022). Medium credibility.

Neurological soft signs (NSS) are common in patients with schizophrenia. However, the neural substrates of NSS remain poorly understood. Using legacy PubMed, we performed a systematic review and included studies that assessed NSS and obtained neuroimaging data in patients with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder published up to June 2020. We systematically reviewed 35 relevant articles. Studies consistently implicate the basal ganglia and cerebellum as structural substrates of NSS and suggest that somatomotor and somatosensory regions as well as areas involved in visual processing and spatial orientation may underlie NSS in psychosis spectrum disorders. Additionally, dysfunction of frontoparietal and cerebellar networks has been implicated in the pathophysiology of NSS. The current literature outlines several structural and functional brain signatures that are relevant for NSS in schizophrenia spectrum disorder. The majority of studies assessed gray matter structure, but only a few studies leveraged other imaging methods such as diffusion weighted imaging, or molecular imaging. Due to this, it remains unclear if white matter integrity deficits or neurometabolic alterations contribute to NSS in the illness. While a substantial portion of the literature has been conducted in patients in the early illness stages, mitigating confounds of illness chronicity, few studies have been conducted in antipsychotic medication-naïve patients, which is a clear limitation. Furthermore, only little is known about the temporal evolution of NSS and associated brain signatures. Future studies addressing these pivotal gaps in our mechanistic understanding of NSS will be important.

### Glutamatergic dysfunction in schizophrenia [^3489b942]. Translational Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

In summary, genetic, post-mortem and neuro-imaging research support broad glutamatergic abnormalities in the brain of schizophrenia subjects. Some of these abnormalities are consistent with the NMDA-R hypofunction model of schizophrenia and they are not secondary to common clinical confounds. However, the extent to which they represent causal mechanisms as opposed to compensations or consequences of more fundamental brain deficits is not clear. Furthermore, these glutamatergic abnormalities do not correlate with important components of the illness, like positive or negative symptoms or cognitive deficits. Informed by these findings and by the NMDA-R hypofunction model, a variety of pharmacological strategies have been tested and have to date, failed. However, a glutamatergic model still has heuristic value to guide future research in schizophrenia. New tools to jointly examine brain glutamatergic, GABA-ergic and dopaminergic systems in-vivo, early in the illness, may lay the ground for a next generation of clinical trials that go beyond dopamine D 2 blockade.

### Medial prefrontal cortex pathology in schizophrenia as revealed by convergent findings from multimodal imaging [^8ee3feb9]. Molecular Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

A third imaging technique that is increasingly being applied to schizophrenia is diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). This indexes white matter abnormality by means of decreased fractional anisotropy (FA); tractography algorithms can also be used to identify which particular tracts are affected. Over 20 studies have indicated that schizophrenia is associated with decreased FA, particularly in the white matter tracts connecting temporal and prefrontal regions. However, to date there is a lack of convergence in the findings, and the majority of studies have used a region-of-interest (ROI) approach rather than whole-brain-based examination.

It has been suggested that further understanding of brain pathology in schizophrenia will depend on the integration of findings from voxel-based structural techniques with those from functional imaging and white matter tractography using DTI. To date, however, relatively few such 'multimodal' imaging studies have been carried out, and these have either used only two imaging techniques, or have focused on discrete brain structures such as the hippocampus and amygdala. In this study, we report for the first time the use of a whole-brain approach combining all three imaging modalities, to determine what, if any, common sites of pathology they identify in the disorder.

### Reduction of plasma glutathione in psychosis associated with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in translational psychiatry [^25a78739]. Translational Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

One of the challenges that face psychiatry today is the absence of mechanistic-driven diagnostic biomarkers. Psychiatric diagnosis is still made based on symptomatology and lacks any molecular foundation. The inability to directly access the brain limits the development of diagnostic measures in psychiatry. As a result, peripheral tissues such as blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from patients are now being used to study the underlying molecular mechanisms of psychiatric disease. The molecular mediators identified from these studies could serve as potential biomarkers.

Another current challenge in psychiatry is the validity of categorizing mental conditions into separate diseases. Modern psychiatry, influenced by the views of Emil Kraepelin, distinguishes schizophrenia (SZ) from bipolar disorder (BP). However, in the past decade, multiple lines of scientific evidence challenged this traditional dichotomy. Psychiatric genetics provides compelling data that SZ and BP share common genetic etiologies. Neuropsychology suggests that cognitive deficits in SZ and BP are similar, although the severity is worse in SZ compared with BP. Brain imaging studies demonstrated an overlap of neuroanatomical changes, such as gray matter reductions in both SZ and BP. It remains elusive whether common key molecular mediators exist in the pathophysiology of both SZ and BP, and if they connect shared genetic risks with gross phenotypic manifestations at the anatomical and clinical levels.

### A systematic review of structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging studies on the neurobiology of depressive symptoms in schizophrenia spectrum disorders [^9e172508]. Schizophrenia (2024). Medium credibility.

Neuroimaging methods could enhance our comprehension of the pathophysiological mechanisms linked to depression in SSDs. For instance, in MDD, identifying neuroimaging correlates of antidepressant treatment responses has enabled researchers to gain insights into how antidepressants impact select brain regions, perhaps leading to improved symptom outcomes. Moreover, neuroimaging can serve as a tool to guide nonpharmacological interventions, such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), allowing for more precise and individualized targeting of symptom-related circuits that optimize treatment response –. In light of robust evidence that rTMS mitigate depressive symptoms in MDDand preliminary support in SSDs, further investigation into neuroimaging correlates may inform the selection of neurostimulation targets. While our knowledge regarding the neural mechanisms underlying depression in SSDs is limited, gaining a deeper understanding has the potential to enhance opportunities for effective intervention.

To our knowledge, there has not been a comprehensive synthesis of existing literature on the neurobiological underpinnings of depressive symptoms in SSDs. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review to provide an overview of studies that investigate the neural correlates of depressive symptoms in SSDs using neuroimaging techniques. Specifically, we focused on structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), encompassing T1-weighted imaging studies evaluating brain morphology (e.g. volume or thickness), diffusion MRI (dMRI) studies examining white matter metrics (e.g. fractional anisotropy (FA) or mean diffusivity (MD)), and T2✱-weighted imaging studies assessing brain function (e.g. activity or connectivity).

### Schizophrenia with prominent catatonic features: a selective review [^aba65793]. Schizophrenia Research (2018). Low credibility.

A widely accepted consensus holds that a variety of motor symptoms subsumed under the term 'catatonia' have been an integral part of the symptomatology of schizophrenia since 1896, when Kraepelin proposed the concept of dementia praecox (schizophrenia). Until recently, psychiatric classifications included catatonic schizophrenia mainly through tradition, without compelling evidence of its validity as a schizophrenia subtype. This selective review briefly summarizes the history, psychopathology, demographic and epidemiological data, and treatment options for schizophrenia with prominent catatonic features. Although most catatonic signs and symptoms are easy to observe and measure, the lack of conceptual clarity of catatonia and consensus about the threshold and criteria for its diagnosis have hampered our understanding of how catatonia contributes to the pathophysiology of schizophrenic psychoses. Diverse study samples and methodologies have further hindered research on schizophrenia with prominent catatonic features. A focus on the motor aspects of broadly defined schizophrenia using modern methods of detecting and quantifying catatonic signs and symptoms coupled with sophisticated neuroimaging techniques offers a new approach to research in this long-overlooked field.

### In vivo reactive astrocyte imaging in patients with schizophrenia using fluorine 18-labeled THK5351 [^f7ec7ed2]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Reactive astrocytes are promising candidates for achieving a comprehensive understanding of glutamate imbalance and neuroinflammation in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia because astrocytes play an important role in glutamate recycling, neurotransmission (including dopamine), and the neuroimmune system, in addition to their basic role in supporting neurons. Reactive astrocytes are remodeled in response to injury, disease, or infection of the brain and can be measured in vivo by detecting overexpressed monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) on the outer mitochondrial membrane. In patients with schizophrenia, abnormal astrocyte-neuronal interactions have been suggested to be the mechanism of psychotic symptom development, and alterations in the expression of astrocyte-related genes and their products in patients' postmortem brains have been reported. However, in vivo reactive astrocyte imaging has not yet been reported in patients with schizophrenia.

In this study, we investigated the in vivo imaging of reactive astrocytes and their association with positive symptoms in patients with schizophrenia using validated MAO-B–binding fluorine 18 ([18 F])–labeled THK5351 PET, to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of the role of reactive astrocytes in schizophrenia pathophysiology. The primary regions of interest (ROIs) were the ACC and hippocampus based on previous studies of glutamate imbalance, neuroinflammation, and positive symptom development in patients with schizophrenia. The secondary ROIs included other limbic regions, such as the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), parahippocampal gyrus, amygdala, insula, and nucleus accumbens, based on previous studies, that reported the association between glutamate alterations and positive symptoms in these regions in patients with schizophrenia.

VA/DoD schizophrenia CPG — research priorities highlight unmet evidence needs and specific questions to guide future work; the Work Group identified "areas requiring stronger evidence to support current recommendations and research exploring new areas to guide future CPGs", and "raised a substantial number of questions that could not be answered with the available evidence". Priority questions include "What genomic, neuroimaging, cognitive, and behavioral markers can support the diagnosis and identification of treatment- or outcome-relevant subtypes of schizophrenia for individuals experiencing first episodes and others?", "Most significantly, what measures can be used to provide measurement-based care for individuals with schizophrenia?", and "What measures can guide the identification of needs, treatment planning, and assessment of treatment outcomes?"

### Towards a muscarinic hypothesis of schizophrenia [^fe81709f]. Molecular Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

Although the neurotransmitter dopamine plays a prominent role in the pathogenesis and treatment of schizophrenia, the dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia fails to explain all aspects of this disorder. It is increasingly evident that the pathology of schizophrenia also involves other neurotransmitter systems. Data from many streams of research including pre-clinical and clinical pharmacology, treatment studies, post-mortem studies and neuroimaging suggest an important role for the muscarinic cholinergic system in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. This review will focus on evidence that supports the hypothesis that the muscarinic system is involved in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and that muscarinic receptors may represent promising novel targets for the treatment of this disorder.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for schizophrenia, more specifically with respect to pretreatment evaluation, BAP 2020 guidelines recommend to assess BP, prolactin, lipids, and blood glucose before the first prescription to identify any abnormalities and evaluate any subsequent changes due to potential adverse effects.

### Schizophrenia in translation: why the eye? [^05ad4e3b]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2022). Medium credibility.

Schizophrenia is increasingly recognized as a systemic disease, characterized by dysregulation in multiple physiological systems (eg, neural, cardiovascular, endocrine). Many of these changes are observed as early as the first psychotic episode, and in people at high risk for the disorder. Expanding the search for biomarkers of schizophrenia beyond genes, blood, and brain may allow for inexpensive, noninvasive, and objective markers of diagnosis, phenotype, treatment response, and prognosis. Several anatomic and physiologic aspects of the eye have shown promise as biomarkers of brain health in a range of neurological disorders, and of heart, kidney, endocrine, and other impairments in other medical conditions. In schizophrenia, thinning and volume loss in retinal neural layers have been observed, and are associated with illness progression, brain volume loss, and cognitive impairment. Retinal microvascular changes have also been observed. Abnormal pupil responses and corneal nerve disintegration are related to aspects of brain function and structure in schizophrenia. In addition, studying the eye can inform about emerging cardiovascular, neuroinflammatory, and metabolic diseases in people with early psychosis, and about the causes of several of the visual changes observed in the disorder. Application of the methods of oculomics, or eye-based biomarkers of non-ophthalmological pathology, to the treatment and study of schizophrenia has the potential to provide tools for patient monitoring and data-driven prediction, as well as for clarifying pathophysiology and course of illness. Given their demonstrated utility in neuropsychiatry, we recommend greater adoption of these tools for schizophrenia research and patient care.

### Disintegration of sensorimotor brain networks in schizophrenia [^a37f964f]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Schizophrenia is a severe mental disorder associated with derogated function across various domains, including perception, language, motor, emotional, and social behavior. Due to its complex symptomatology, schizophrenia is often regarded a disorder of cognitive processes. Yet due to the frequent involvement of sensory and perceptual symptoms, it has been hypothesized that functional disintegration between sensory and cognitive processes mediates the heterogeneous and comprehensive schizophrenia symptomatology.

Methods

Here, using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging in 71 patients and 196 healthy controls, we characterized the standard deviation in BOLD (blood-oxygen-level-dependent) signal amplitude and the functional connectivity across a range of functional brain networks. We investigated connectivity on the edge and node level using network modeling based on independent component analysis and utilized the brain network features in cross-validated classification procedures.

Results

Both amplitude and connectivity were significantly altered in patients, largely involving sensory networks. Reduced standard deviation in amplitude was observed in a range of visual, sensorimotor, and auditory nodes in patients. The strongest differences in connectivity implicated within-sensorimotor and sensorimotor-thalamic connections. Furthermore, sensory nodes displayed widespread alterations in the connectivity with higher-order nodes. We demonstrated robustness of effects across subjects by significantly classifying diagnostic group on the individual level based on cross-validated multivariate connectivity features.

Conclusion

Taken together, the findings support the hypothesis of disintegrated sensory and cognitive processes in schizophrenia, and the foci of effects emphasize that targeting the sensory and perceptual domains may be key to enhance our understanding of schizophrenia pathophysiology.

### Detecting schizophrenia at the level of the individual: relative diagnostic value of whole-brain images, connectome-wide functional connectivity and graph-based metrics [^37f715eb]. Psychological Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Because none of the existing studies on schizophrenia has employed all three approaches, at present, it is unclear which type of alteration best captures the neural correlates of the disorder at the level of the individual patient. This information would be important both from a clinical translation and theoretical modelling perspective. From a clinical translation perspective, understanding which type of approach is most discriminant between patients and controls would help us develop more accurate ML algorithms. From a theoretical modelling perspective, such understanding would shed light on the neural correlates of schizophrenia and inform current neurobiological models of the illness.

The present article, therefore, aims to elucidate the neural correlates of schizophrenia by comparing the diagnostic accuracy of three distinct metrics of brain function: pre-processed whole-brain images, connectome-wide functional connectivity and graph-based metrics. In order to assess the reliability of the findings, we perform this comparison using three ML methods of varying degrees of complexity and abstraction: logistic regression (LR) (lower complexity), support vector machine (SVM) (medium complexity) and deep learning (DL) technology (higher complexity). We used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data acquired at five different sites from a total of 295 patients with schizophrenia and 452 healthy controls. Our main dependent variable of interest was the accuracy of classification for the comparison between patients and controls. In light of the current understanding of psychiatric disorders as abnormalities in connectome-wide functional connectivity (Rubinov and Bullmore,) and topological properties (Suo et al.), we hypothesized that (i) the use of measures of functional integration (i.e. connectome-wide functional connectivity and graph-based metrics) would allow diagnostic classification with higher level of accuracy than whole-brain images. In addition, given that whole-brain functional integration may provide a richer characterization of network-level functioning than topological properties, we hypothesized that (ii) the use of connectome-wide matrices would allow a higher level of accuracy than graph-based analytic metrics. Finally, based on a previous large-scale investigation (Sabuncu et al.), we hypothesized that (iii) these findings would be consistent across different ML methods including logistic regression, SVM and DL technology, thereby supporting the reliability of our conclusions.

### Psychomotor symptoms of schizophrenia map on the cerebral motor circuit [^3cf3727f]. Psychiatry Research (2015). Low credibility.

Schizophrenia is a devastating disorder thought to result mainly from cerebral pathology. Neuroimaging studies have provided a wealth of findings of brain dysfunction in schizophrenia. However, we are still far from understanding how particular symptoms can result from aberrant brain function. In this context, the high prevalence of motor symptoms in schizophrenia such as catatonia, neurological soft signs, parkinsonism, and abnormal involuntary movements is of particular interest. Here, the neuroimaging correlates of these motor symptoms are reviewed. For all investigated motor symptoms, neural correlates were found within the cerebral motor system. However, only a limited set of results exists for hypokinesia and neurological soft signs, while catatonia, abnormal involuntary movements and parkinsonian signs still remain understudied with neuroimaging methods. Soft signs have been associated with altered brain structure and function in cortical premotor and motor areas as well as cerebellum and thalamus. Hypokinesia is suggested to result from insufficient interaction of thalamocortical loops within the motor system. Future studies are needed to address the neural correlates of motor abnormalities in prodromal states, changes during the course of the illness, and the specific pathophysiology of catatonia, dyskinesia and parkinsonism in schizophrenia.

### Accuracy of diagnostic classification algorithms using cognitive-, electrophysiological-, and neuroanatomical data in antipsychotic-naïve schizophrenia patients [^38c622a7]. Psychological Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

A wealth of clinical studies have successfully applied various objective measures to identify biomarkers, which separate schizophrenia patients from healthy controls on a group level. Although these studies have provided profound insight into the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, these efforts have not been translated into diagnostic utility (Kapur et al.). Thus, the diagnosis of schizophrenia according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder (DSM) and International Classification of Diseases (ICD) classifications entirely relies on clinical symptoms. Likewise, no clinical or objective measures for course of illness or response to antipsychotic medication have been implemented into clinical practice.

Numerous studies using objective cognitive test batteries such as Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) (Robbins et al.) have established that cognitive deficits in, e.g. attention, verbal memory, and working memory are enduring and core features of schizophrenia, which are relatively unaffected by clinical state of the psychopathological symptoms (Paulus et al; Gur et al; Kahn and Keefe).

Assessment of early information processing as measured with electrophysiological paradigms has also indicated impairments in schizophrenia patients, and also these disturbances are generally considered unaffected by disease stage and severity of symptoms (Koychev et al; Thibaut et al; Blakey et al.). Commonly used electrophysiological paradigms comprise P50 suppression (Adler et al.), pre-pulse inhibition of the startle response (PPI) (Braff and Geyer,), and mismatch negativity (MMN) (Shelley et al.).

Finally, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has demonstrated that schizophrenia is associated with structural brain changes (Haijma et al.). Gray matter structures have commonly been assessed with a region of interest (ROI) approach, but the development of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) techniques such as tract-based spatial statistics have enabled assessment of the cerebral white matter microstructure (Smith et al.). Overall, both subtle gray (Shepherd et al; Gong et al.) and white matter (Fitzsimmons et al; Canu et al.) deficits are present already at illness onset and before initiation of antipsychotic medication.

### A systematic review of structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging studies on the neurobiology of depressive symptoms in schizophrenia spectrum disorders [^fe334b89]. Schizophrenia (2024). Medium credibility.

Depressive symptoms in Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders (SSDs) negatively impact suicidality, prognosis, and quality of life. Despite this, efficacious treatments are limited, largely because the neural mechanisms underlying depressive symptoms in SSDs remain poorly understood. We conducted a systematic review to provide an overview of studies that investigated the neural correlates of depressive symptoms in SSDs using neuroimaging techniques. We searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases from inception through June 19, 2023. Specifically, we focused on structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), encompassing: (1) T1-weighted imaging measuring brain morphology; (2) diffusion-weighted imaging assessing white matter integrity; or (3) T2✱-weighted imaging measures of brain function. Our search yielded 33 articles; 14 structural MRI studies, 18 functional (f)MRI studies, and 1 multimodal fMRI/MRI study. Reviewed studies indicate potential commonalities in the neurobiology of depressive symptoms between SSDs and major depressive disorders, particularly in subcortical and frontal brain regions, though confidence in this interpretation is limited. The review underscores a notable knowledge gap in our understanding of the neurobiology of depression in SSDs, marked by inconsistent approaches and few studies examining imaging metrics of depressive symptoms. Inconsistencies across studies' findings emphasize the necessity for more direct and comprehensive research focusing on the neurobiology of depression in SSDs. Future studies should go beyond "total score" depression metrics and adopt more nuanced assessment approaches considering distinct subdomains. This could reveal unique neurobiological profiles and inform investigations of targeted treatments for depression in SSDs.

### Toward understanding thalamocortical dysfunction in schizophrenia through computational models of neural circuit dynamics [^8f2e3910]. Schizophrenia Research (2017). Low credibility.

The thalamus is implicated in the neuropathology of schizophrenia, and multiple modalities of noninvasive neuroimaging provide converging evidence for altered thalamocortical dynamics in the disorder, such as functional connectivity and oscillatory power. However, it remains a challenge to link these neuroimaging biomarkers to underlying neural circuit mechanisms. One potential path forward is a "Computational Psychiatry" approach that leverages computational models of neural circuits to make predictions for the dynamical impact dynamical impact on specific thalamic disruptions hypothesized to occur in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Here we review biophysically-based computational models of neural circuit dynamics for large-scale resting-state networks which have been applied to schizophrenia, and for thalamic oscillations. As a key aspect of thalamocortical dysconnectivity in schizophrenia is its regional specificity, it is important to consider potential sources of intrinsic heterogeneity of cellular and circuit properties across cortical and thalamic structures.

### Connectivity of the anterior insula differentiates participants with first-episode schizophrenia spectrum disorders from controls: a machine-learning study [^a166c015]. Psychological Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Early diagnosis of schizophrenia could improve the outcomes and limit the negative effects of untreated illness. Although participants with schizophrenia show aberrant functional connectivity in brain networks, these between-group differences have a limited diagnostic utility. Novel methods of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) analyses, such as machine learning (ML), may help bring neuroimaging from the bench to the bedside. Here, we used ML to differentiate participants with a first episode of schizophrenia-spectrum disorder (FES) from healthy controls based on resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC).

Method

We acquired resting-state functional MRI data from 63 patients with FES who were individually matched by age and sex to 63 healthy controls. We applied linear kernel support vector machines (SVM) to rsFC within the default mode network, the salience network and the central executive network.

Results

The SVM applied to the rsFC within the salience network distinguished the FES from the control participants with an accuracy of 73.0% (p = 0.001), specificity of 71.4% and sensitivity of 74.6%. The classification accuracy was not significantly affected by medication dose, or by the presence of psychotic symptoms. The functional connectivity within the default mode or the central executive networks did not yield classification accuracies above chance level.

Conclusions

Seed-based functional connectivity maps can be utilized for diagnostic classification, even early in the course of schizophrenia. The classification was probably based on trait rather than state markers, as symptoms or medications were not significantly associated with classification accuracy. Our results support the role of the anterior insula/salience network in the pathophysiology of FES.

### Molecular substrates of schizophrenia: homeostatic signaling to connectivity [^46e9c736]. Molecular Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Schizophrenia (SZ) is a devastating psychiatric condition affecting numerous brain systems. Recent studies have identified genetic factors that confer an increased risk of SZ and participate in the disease etiopathogenesis. In parallel to such bottom-up approaches, other studies have extensively reported biological changes in patients by brain imaging, neurochemical and pharmacological approaches. This review highlights the molecular substrates identified through studies with SZ patients, namely those using top-down approaches, while also referring to the fruitful outcomes of recent genetic studies. We have subclassified the molecular substrates by system, focusing on elements of neurotransmission, targets in white matter-associated connectivity, immune/inflammatory and oxidative stress-related substrates, and molecules in endocrine and metabolic cascades. We further touch on cross-talk among these systems and comment on the utility of animal models in charting the developmental progression and interaction of these substrates. Based on this comprehensive information, we propose a framework for SZ research based on the hypothesis of an imbalance in homeostatic signaling from immune/inflammatory, oxidative stress, endocrine and metabolic cascades that, at least in part, underlies deficits in neural connectivity relevant to SZ. Thus, this review aims to provide information that is translationally useful and complementary to pathogenic hypotheses that have emerged from genetic studies. Based on such advances in SZ research, it is highly expected that we will discover biomarkers that may help in the early intervention, diagnosis or treatment of SZ.

### Reproducing the dopamine pathophysiology of schizophrenia and approaches to ameliorate it: a translational imaging study with ketamine [^a7a87244]. Molecular Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Schizophrenia is a severe mental disorder and a significant global health burden, highlighting the need to better understand its neurobiology in order to develop improved treatments. Dopaminergic hyperactivity in the striatum is thought to underlie the symptoms of schizophrenia, particularly psychosis. Supporting this, 3,4-dihydroxy-6- 18 F-fluoro-l-phenylalanine ([18 F]-FDOPA) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging studies have revealed higher striatal dopamine synthesis capacity in patients with schizophrenia. Furthermore, increased dopamine synthesis capacity is associated with both the development of psychosis and the severity of symptoms. Currently available antipsychotics are all dopamine receptor blockers, which are inadequate and poorly tolerated in many patients, and do not address the mechanism underlying the dopamine dysfunction. In addition to dopaminergic dysfunction, the glutamate hypothesis of schizophrenia has developed from the observations that N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonists such as ketamine induce psychotic symptoms in healthy humans and exacerbate symptoms in patients. Furthermore, schizophrenia is associated with a reduction in parvalbumin (PV)-expressing GABAergic interneurons, which are regulated by NMDARs in the cortex and hippocampus. It has been suggested that impaired PV neuronal function in the cortex and hippocampus may lead to disinhibition of mesostriatal dopamine neuron activity via a polysynaptic pathway. However, it is not clear if it is possible to develop a pre-clinical model of the increased dopamine synthesis capacity seen in patients using an NMDAR antagonist, and whether it is possible to reverse this by targeting PV-expressing interneurons or other mechanisms.

To address this, we tested the effect of sub-chronic ketamine administration on dopamine synthesis capacity in mice using the same [18 F]-FDOPA PET imaging technique that previously demonstrated elevation in dopamine synthesis capacity in patients, and also tested the potential of activating PV-interneurons to reverse the effects of ketamine on striatal dopamine synthesis capacity. We also tested the translational potential of a novel psychotropic agent, SEP-0363856 (SEP-856), to reverse striatal dopaminergic alterations based on evidence that it inhibits ventral tegmental area (VTA) neuronal firing. Our objective was to develop a chemogenetics/PET approach that is translationally relevant and provides novel insights into the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.

### Precision biomarkers for mood disorders based on brain imaging [^5f1de7ac]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Diagnostic confusion

Current diagnostic systems, including the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder and International Classification of Diseases, were developed based on clinical symptoms and signs. The acquired diagnostic categories do not align with the underlying psychopathology or predict treatment response. The diagnostic categories of major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder, for example, share many clinical symptoms, while patients with these diagnoses present with heterogeneous symptoms.

Clinical symptoms may be shared across mood disorders or with psychiatric disorders. For example, major depressive disorder is commonly associated with anxiety symptoms, but these also occur in bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Recent studies have used brain imaging and transdiagnostic approaches to characterise the neural basis of the shared symptoms. Resting state fMRI data showed that patients with major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia had common brain functional deficits. More generally, recent studies proposed a general psychopathology factor (p factor) to describe a shared vulnerability to a broad range of symptoms across mental disorders, and a higher p factor was associated with diminished activation of the frontal pole, anterior cingulate cortex, and anterior insula during executive tasks. The imbalance in these brain circuits is believed to confer vulnerability to mood disorders as well as other mental disorders, which could be the underlying mechanism of the shared symptoms. Other specific brain circuits related to factors such as anhedonia may therefore give rise to specific diagnoses such as major depressive disorder.

Heterogeneity is also a problem in the current diagnostic system. Mood disorders are increasingly viewed not as a unitary disease but as a heterogeneous clinical syndrome that encompasses multiple subtypes with distinct pathophysiological deficits. Interest is therefore growing in parsing the neurobiological heterogeneity of mood disorders. Drysdale and colleagues subdivided major depressive disorder into four discrete biotypes using a clustering approach, each type defined by distinct patterns of dysfunctional connectivity in the limbic and frontostriatal systems. Rather than dividing mood disorders into discrete categories, dimensional approaches are able to parse them into several dimensions using brain imaging, with each dimension representing loadings onto symptoms. Dimensional approaches can account for the continuous spectrum from health to disease by including people at risk of illness and considering diagnosable cases as an extreme phenotype. Consistent with these efforts, the US National Institute of Mental Health research domain criteriaframework invited the scientific and clinical communities to integrate brain imaging, cognition, and clinical symptoms to develop a novel biologically informed nosology and precision biomarkers for mood disorders.

### Collaborative care in the identification and management of psychosis in adolescents and young adults [^c1e95f94]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Etiology of psychotic symptoms — neuroanatomical abnormalities in schizophrenia are summarized: disruptions in brain connectivity and synaptic functioning likely underlie schizophrenia and may first affect neural circuits referencing occurrences by time, place, and saliency, contributing to loss of reality testing; axonal pathology such as disruption in myelination and excessive synaptic pruning, possibly linked to immune mechanisms, may be involved; structural findings include bilateral enlargement of lateral ventricles and volume decreases in the frontal lobe, hippocampus, and thalamus, with reduced frontal and temporal gray matter volume compared with healthy controls; childhood-onset and early-onset schizophrenia show greater gray matter loss and decreased cortical folding.

### Thalamic dopamine D2-receptor availability in schizophrenia: a study on antipsychotic-naive patients with first-episode psychosis and a meta-analysis [^29c47274]. Molecular Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The dopamine system has for several decades been of central importance for research on the pathophysiology and treatment of schizophrenia. Well over one hundred molecular imaging studies have investigated the in vivo effects of antipsychotic treatments, showing that all currently licensed antipsychotic drugs block dopamine D2 receptors (D2-R). Moreover, a causal role for D2-R in the disease mechanism of schizophrenia has been suggested by genetic studies. Molecular imaging studies have shown a slight increase in striatal D2-R in psychosis and schizophrenia patients compared with controls, although this was not significant in the subsample of antipsychotic-naive first-episode patients. However several other brain regions have been considered more important in generating the diversity of symptoms observed in schizophrenia. Further investigations of dopaminergic function outside of the striatum is therefore needed in order to understand the pathophysiology of the disorder.

A region of key interest in schizophrenia is the thalamus, which is richly interconnected to the cortex, and plays a central role in coordinating signaling both to and in between cortical regions. In a series of positron emission tomography (PET) studies using the high-affinity D2-R radioligands [11 C]FLB 457 and [18 F]Fallypride, which were developed for low-density extrastriatal regions, D2-R binding has shown to be lower in thalamus in patients with psychosis compared with controls. However, no differences, or increases have also been observed using these radioligands. A meta-analysis, which also included studies using other radioligands, showed lower thalamic D2-R binding in patients (d = −0.32), but the difference was not statistically significant. Importantly, the analysis included several studies with patients with previous exposure to medication and in later disease stages, and some of the studies used radioligands with low signal-to-noise for quantifying D2-R in extrastriatal brain regions. Hence, additional studies are needed to confirm if there indeed is a decrease of D2-R in thalamus in schizophrenia, preferably using high-affinity radioligands in samples not affected by antipsychotic drug treatment and other confounders stemming from chronical illness.

### Aging in schizophrenia: perspectives on molecular mechanisms and a mini-review [^15297c21]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Evidence suggests that patients with schizophrenia (SZ) experience an acceleration of the typical aging process. However, it is unclear whether this process reflects premature aging in early life or accelerated aging in later years. Nevertheless, although the timing of accelerated aging in SZ is unclear, there is a consensus that this process is characterized by dysfunctions in immune-oxidative pathway.

Methods

It is a critical need to understand the mechanisms and trajectory of aging underlying SZ so we can target interventions earlier to the right mechanisms. This paper aims to review the recent literature regarding brain energy metabolism in aging with SZ, mainly focusing on the dysfunctions in immuno-oxidative pathway, limitations of studying aging in SZ, and perspective strategies for future studies.

Results

Most studies reviewed in this paper point toward age-related metabolic and cognitive alterations in individuals with SZ. There are complex relationships between normative aging processes and those in SZ. However, the available data neither definitively reveal when this acceleration occurs within the life span nor attribute premature onset of aging-related changes solely to a diagnosis of SZ.

Conclusions

Immuno-oxidative pathway dysregulation represents convergent processes underlying the pathophysiology of both SZ and aging, contributing to synaptic dysfunction, neuronal damage, and cognitive impairment. Further research in this domain, using an innovative accelerated longitudinal design and novel, advanced neuroimaging techniques, might open new avenues for understanding common pathophysiological mechanisms and developing therapeutic interventions targeting these interconnected pathways.

### Cerebro-cerebellar gray matter abnormalities associated with cognitive impairment in patients with recent-onset and chronic schizophrenia [^fcc72748]. Schizophrenia (2024). Medium credibility.

Neuroimaging studies of the cerebellum have demonstrated that patients with schizophrenia have smaller cerebellar gray matter (GM) volume than healthy controls (HCs) –. These findings have been observed in both antipsychotic-naïve, chronically medicated, and first-episode patients with schizophrenia –. Despite contradictory findings of larger cerebellar GM volumes –, a multisite mega-analysis of 983 patients has demonstrated that the total cerebellar GM volume is robustly decreased in patients with schizophrenia than that in HCs, and the volume reduction is highly consistent across ages from late adolescence. Furthermore, a smaller cerebellar volume has been observed in unaffected first-degree relatives of patients with schizophreniaand individuals at ultra-high risk for psychosis, suggesting that structural abnormalities in the cerebellum present before the onset of overt psychosis and may confer susceptibility to schizophrenia. Consistent with the notion that schizophrenia is characterized by poor coordination of cognitive processes, structural changes in the cerebellum have been associated with cognitive impairment across multiple domains in patients with schizophrenia. Functional neuroimaging studies have also provided compelling evidence of dysfunctional activation of the cerebellum not only during motor tasks, but also during cognitive and affective tasks in patients with schizophrenia –. However, the relationship between the cerebellum and non-motor higher-order functions remains unclear because the cerebellum intertwines with the cerebrum, and their interaction is highly complicated.

To better understand the role of the cerebellum in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia, an integrative framework of the cerebro-cerebellar interactions through the CCTCC is required. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) are common neuroimaging modalities that assess the interactions between distinct brain regions at functional and structural levels, respectively. Previous functional MRI studies have demonstrated that dysfunctional connectivity of the CCTCC is associated with impaired cognitive performance, and clinical manifestations, including positive and negative symptoms – and self-experience disturbances, in patients with schizophrenia. DTI studies have indicated that aberrations in white matter tracts connecting the cerebrum and cerebellum correlate with poor cognitive functioning – and clinical symptom severity. While both modalities provide useful information on connections between the two parts of the brain, they do not correspond perfectly with each other because functional connectivity is derived from complex polysynaptic interactions in structural networks. Furthermore, connectivity analysis does not provide direct information about the characteristics of the GM, which contains neuronal cell bodies and dendritic branches that function to command various mental operations.

### Connectome architecture shapes large-scale cortical alterations in schizophrenia: a worldwide ENIgMA study [^7e4e54c3]. Molecular Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Schizophrenia is a prototypical network disorder with widespread brain-morphological alterations, yet it remains unclear whether these distributed alterations robustly reflect the underlying network layout. We tested whether large-scale structural alterations in schizophrenia relate to normative structural and functional connectome architecture, and systematically evaluated robustness and generalizability of these network-level alterations. Leveraging anatomical MRI scans from 2439 adults with schizophrenia and 2867 healthy controls from 26 ENIGMA sites and normative data from the Human Connectome Project (n = 207), we evaluated structural alterations of schizophrenia against two network susceptibility models: (i) hub vulnerability, which examines associations between regional network centrality and magnitude of disease-related alterations; (ii) epicenter mapping, which identifies regions whose typical connectivity profile most closely resembles the disease-related morphological alterations. To assess generalizability and specificity, we contextualized the influence of site, disease stages, and individual clinical factors and compared network associations of schizophrenia with that found in affective disorders. Our findings show schizophrenia-related cortical thinning is spatially associated with functional and structural hubs, suggesting that highly interconnected regions are more vulnerable to morphological alterations. Predominantly temporo-paralimbic and frontal regions emerged as epicenters with connectivity profiles linked to schizophrenia's alteration patterns. Findings were robust across sites, disease stages, and related to individual symptoms. Moreover, transdiagnostic comparisons revealed overlapping epicenters in schizophrenia and bipolar, but not major depressive disorder, suggestive of a pathophysiological continuity within the schizophrenia-bipolar-spectrum. In sum, cortical alterations over the course of schizophrenia robustly follow brain network architecture, emphasizing marked hub susceptibility and temporo-frontal epicenters at both the level of the group and the individual. Subtle variations of epicenters across disease stages suggest interacting pathological processes, while associations with patient-specific symptoms support additional inter-individual variability of hub vulnerability and epicenters in schizophrenia. Our work outlines potential pathways to better understand macroscale structural alterations, and inter- individual variability in schizophrenia.
