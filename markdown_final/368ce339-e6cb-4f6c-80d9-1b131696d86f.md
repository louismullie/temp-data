## Question

According to the GOLD 2024 guidelines, what are the primary environmental exposures that lead to the development of COPD, and how do genetic factors like the SERPINA1 gene mutation contribute to the disease?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the primary environmental exposures that lead to the development of COPD according to the GOLD 2024 guidelines, and how genetic factors like the SERPINA1 gene mutation contribute to the disease. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching pathogenesis model (GETomics) to anchor causation. Then, I should verify the primary environmental exposures and their relative contributions globally. Next, I will examine the genetic landscape, with special focus on SERPINA1/AATD, and reconcile prevalence and risk nuances. After that, I should review additional genetic variants and their effect sizes. Finally, I will integrate gene–environment–time interactions and translate this into clinical implications for screening, prevention, and management, making sure I double-check any points that might be outdated or overstated before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the conceptual framework. GOLD 2024/2025 frames COPD as the end-result of dynamic, cumulative gene–environment–time (GET) interactions that damage lungs and/or alter normal development and aging trajectories, which means both the exposure and the timing/context of exposure matter for risk and phenotype expression [^117C3VuB] [^112HQBsk] [^113xh9nq].

> Now, I should verify the primary environmental exposures. Tobacco smoking remains the most important and consistently identified risk factor worldwide, with higher symptom burden, faster FEV1 decline, and higher mortality in smokers. However, fewer than 50% of heavy smokers develop clinically significant COPD, underscoring host susceptibility and timing effects [^1171okTx]. Wait, let me verify the scope beyond smoking: household and ambient air pollution from biomass fuels and traffic-related pollutants are major contributors, especially in low- and middle-income countries where non-smoking COPD accounts for a large fraction of cases; occupational exposures to dusts, fumes, and gases also contribute substantially, with population-attributable fractions around 19% overall and higher among never-smokers; passive smoke exposure and maternal smoking during pregnancy further increase risk by impairing lung development and priming inflammatory responses [^113Fff2X] [^117NmwQq] [^113XSskK] [^112Mwe5u].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about smoking being the only driver. I need to check the global burden framing: in LMICs, non-smoking risk factors account for over half of COPD cases, and air pollution alone may explain roughly 50% of attributable risk in those settings, reinforcing that biomass smoke, ambient PM2.5, and occupational hazards are primary environmental drivers alongside tobacco in many regions [^113Fff2X] [^113XSskK].

> Next, I should review genetic contributors. The most relevant genetic risk factor identified is SERPINA1 mutations causing alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD), which impairs antiprotease defense and predisposes to early-onset emphysema, particularly in smokers. Importantly, heterozygotes (MZ, SZ) generally do not have increased COPD risk in the absence of smoking, though smoking can unmask risk and reduce lung function relative to non-smoking siblings, so I need to be careful not to overstate risk in heterozygotes [^116HJLcC] [^113F2Vix]. Let me double-check prevalence: PiZZ occurs in about 0.12% of COPD patients in Europe, with regional variation from ~1 in 408 to ~1 in 1,274, and augmentation therapy is typically reserved for those with severe deficiency and airflow obstruction, not for heterozygotes without smoking exposure [^116HJLcC] [^113F2Vix].

> I will now examine additional genetic variants. Beyond SERPINA1, numerous loci have small individual effects on COPD susceptibility and lung function, including MMP12, GST genes, CHRNA3/5, HHIP, and others. Cumulatively, these variants contribute to heritability, and polygenic risk scores built from GWAS can predict COPD and imaging phenotypes, though each variant explains only a small proportion of variance, consistent with a polygenic architecture [^113rhUfE] [^113vMvNA] [^114wzBAH]. Wait, I should verify that GOLD aligns with this view: yes, GOLD notes that while many variants associate with reduced lung function and COPD risk, their individual effect sizes are small, reinforcing the need to consider cumulative genetic risk rather than any single gene outside of AATD [^112HQBsk].

> Let me consider the gene–environment–time interplay more explicitly. The GETomics model implies that the same exposure at different ages can have different consequences, and that prior exposures create a biological memory that shapes later responses; for example, early-life exposures (including maternal smoking, prematurity, low birth weight, and childhood infections) can impair lung development and set a lower maximal lung function, predisposing to earlier COPD even with average adult decline rates; conversely, adult exposures like smoking or occupational dusts accelerate decline from whatever baseline was established in youth [^117C3VuB] [^113Fff2X]. I should confirm that GOLD operationalizes early-life and developmental risks in its etiologic taxonomy: yes, GOLD recognizes COPD-D (developmental), COPD-C (cigarette), COPD-P (pollution/biomass), COPD-G (genetic), and other etiotypes, reflecting this life-course perspective [^111kcvfK].

> But wait, what about clinical translation. I need to ensure screening and prevention advice align with these risks. GOLD recommends active case-finding with spirometry in symptomatic individuals or those with risk factors (for example, > 20 pack-years, biomass exposure, occupational hazards, early-life events), rather than population screening, and emphasizes smoking cessation, reduction of occupational and household pollutant exposures, and attention to early-life and genetic risks during history-taking and counseling [^115CCHb3] [^112FpNQt] [^1145uVKq]. Hold on, I should verify the role of augmentation therapy: augmentation is appropriate for severe AATD (typically PiZZ or null genotypes) with airflow obstruction, with observational and CT-based evidence of benefit in selected patients, but is not indicated for heterozygotes without smoking-related disease, reinforcing the need to confirm genotype and phenotype before initiating therapy [^113F2Vix].

> In summary, I should confirm the core message. Primary environmental drivers of COPD include tobacco smoke, household and ambient air pollution (notably biomass and PM2.5), and occupational exposures, with their relative contributions varying by geography and life course. Genetic susceptibility is largely polygenic, with SERPINA1/AATD as the most impactful but rare monogenic cause, and the interplay of genes, exposures, and timing determines who develops COPD and how it presents, which is why GOLD's GETomics framework and etiologic taxonomy are central to understanding risk and tailoring prevention and care [^112HQBsk] [^117C3VuB] [^111kcvfK].

---

Per GOLD 2024, the **primary environmental exposures** driving COPD are tobacco smoke, household and ambient air pollution (notably biomass smoke and PM2.5), and occupational dusts, fumes, and gases [^113Fff2X] [^113XSskK] [^117NmwQq]. These exposures interact with host factors over time; **SERPINA1 mutations** causing alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) are the most relevant genetic risk factor, conferring high risk for early-onset emphysema, especially in smokers [^116HJLcC] [^113F2Vix]. AATD is rare but clinically significant, and GOLD recommends targeted screening in patients with early-onset COPD, minimal smoking history, or a family history of AATD [^notfound].

## Primary environmental exposures contributing to COPD

GOLD 2024 emphasizes that COPD results from **gene–environment–time interactions**, with environmental exposures as the dominant drivers [^117C3VuB]. The **primary environmental exposures** include:

| **Environmental exposure** | **Description and evidence** |
|-|-|
| Tobacco smoke | - Strongest risk factor <br/> - Higher prevalence of respiratory symptoms, faster FEV1 decline, and higher mortality in smokers [^1171okTx] <br/> - Passive smoke and other tobacco forms (pipe, cigar, hookah, marijuana) also contribute [^112Mwe5u] |
| Household air pollution | - Biomass smoke (wood, dung, crop residues, coal) from poorly functioning stoves is a major risk, especially in LMICs [^113Fff2X] <br/> - Responsible for ~50% of attributable COPD risk in LMICs [^notfound] |
| Ambient air pollution | - PM2.5, ozone, NOx, SOx, and other pollutants increase COPD risk, exacerbate symptoms, and drive hospitalizations and mortality [^113XSskK] <br/> - Risk is dose-dependent with no safe threshold [^117NmwQq] |
| Occupational exposures | - Organic and inorganic dusts, chemical agents, and fumes are underrecognized risks [^117NmwQq] <br/> - Attributable fraction ~19% overall, ~31% in never-smokers [^117NmwQq] |

---

These exposures interact with host factors (genetics, lung development, aging) over time, producing **heterogeneous COPD phenotypes** [^112HQBsk].

---

## Genetic factors contributing to COPD

While environmental exposures dominate, **genetic susceptibility** significantly modifies risk and phenotype. GOLD 2024 highlights **SERPINA1 mutations** as the most relevant genetic risk factor [^113xh9nq].

---

### SERPINA1 gene mutations and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD)

- **Genetics**: SERPINA1 encodes alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT), a serine protease inhibitor that protects lung tissue from neutrophil elastase–mediated damage [^117NmwQq] [^117J2kAK].
- **Mutations**: The most common pathogenic variants are PI*Z and PI*S, with PI*ZZ causing severe AATD (plasma AAT < 57 mg/dL) [^notfound].
- **Prevalence**: PI*ZZ occurs in ~0.12% of COPD patients, ranging from 1 in 408 (Northern Europe) to 1 in 1,274 (Eastern Europe) [^116HJLcC].
- **Risk**: AATD markedly increases COPD risk, especially early-onset emphysema in smokers; never-smokers with PI*ZZ can still develop emphysema, though less commonly [^116HJLcC] [^113F2Vix].
- **Heterozygotes**: PI*MZ and PI*SZ generally do not have increased COPD risk without smoking, though smokers with these genotypes show greater lung function decline [^116HJLcC] [^113F2Vix].

---

### Other genetic variants

Other variants (e.g. MMP12, GST, CHRNA3/5, HHIP) have small individual effects but may cumulatively increase risk; **polygenic risk scores** based on GWAS variants predict COPD and related phenotypes, supporting a polygenic architecture [^113rhUfE] [^113vMvNA].

---

## Clinical implications and recommendations

GOLD 2024 provides **practical guidance** on recognizing and managing genetic risk:

- **Screening**: Consider AATD testing in patients with early-onset COPD (< 45 years), minimal smoking history, or a family history of AATD or emphysema [^notfound].
- **Management**: Smoking cessation is critical; AAT augmentation therapy is recommended for PI*ZZ individuals with airflow obstruction and symptoms, particularly when FEV1 is 35–60% predicted [^113F2Vix].
- **Counseling**: Patients and families should be counseled on genetic risks and smoking avoidance [^112AwX6C].

---

## Summary of key points

- **Primary environmental exposures**: Tobacco smoke, household/ambient air pollution, and occupational dusts/fumes are the primary environmental drivers of COPD [^113Fff2X] [^113XSskK] [^117NmwQq].
- **Genetic risk**: SERPINA1 mutations causing AATD are the most relevant genetic risk factor, conferring high risk for early-onset emphysema, especially in smokers [^116HJLcC] [^113F2Vix].
- **Interaction**: COPD arises from gene–environment–time interactions, with environmental exposures typically dominating but genetic susceptibility modulating risk and phenotype [^117C3VuB].

---

GOLD 2024 underscores that COPD is a multifactorial disease in which **environmental exposures** are the primary drivers, while **SERPINA1 mutations** represent the most significant genetic risk, particularly in early-onset disease. Recognizing these factors enables targeted screening, prevention, and management strategies.

### Epidemiology of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^115Ydz2v]. The European Respiratory Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of world-wide mortality and disability. On average approximately 5–15% of adults in industrialized countries have COPD defined by spirometry. In 1990, COPD was considered to be at the twelfth position world-wide as a cause of combined mortality and disability but is expected to become the fifth cause by the year 2020. COPD has a chronic long-lasting course characterized by irreversible decline of forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), increasing presence of dyspnoea and other respiratory symptoms, and progressive deterioration of health status. After diagnosis the 10-yr survival rate is approximately 50% with more than one-third of patients dying due to respiratory insufficiency. Several environmental exposures such as air pollution increase the risk of death in COPD patients. The aetiology of COPD is overwhelmingly dominated by smoking although many other factors could play a role. Particular genetic variants are likely to increase the susceptibility to environmental factors although little is known about which are the relevant genes. There is clear evidence about the role of the alpha-1-antitrypsin but the fraction of COPD attributable to the relevant variants is only 1%. Phenotypic traits that are considered to play a role in the development of COPD include sex, with females being at a higher risk, bronchial responsiveness and atopy. There is strong causal evidence regarding the relationship between smoking and COPD with decline in FEVI levelling off after smoking cessation. Passive smoking has been found to be associated with a small though statistically significant decline in FEV1. Other risk factors that are likely to be relevant in the development of COPD are occupation, low socioeconomic status, diet and possibly some environmental exposures in early life. Although there is accumulating evidence that oxygen therapy, pharmacological treatment and rehabilitation may improve the course of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, preventing smoking continues to be the most relevant measure, not only to prevent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, but also to arrest its development.

Air pollution — particulate matter, ozone, oxides of nitrogen or sulfur, heavy metals, and other greenhouse gases — is a major worldwide cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), responsible for approximately 50% of the attributable risk for COPD in low- and middle-income countries, and is the leading known risk factor for COPD in never smokers. Risk is dose-dependent with no apparent safe thresholds; even with low ambient levels, chronic exposure to PM2.5 and nitrogen dioxides impairs lung growth in children, accelerates lung function decline in adults, and increases COPD risk. Poor air quality also increases COPD exacerbations, hospitalizations and mortality, so reduction in both indoor and outdoor air pollution is a key goal in the prevention and management of COPD.

Inflammatory changes in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) appear to modify the normal inflammatory response to chronic irritants such as cigarette smoke; the mechanisms are not yet fully understood but may, at least in part, be genetically determined. COPD is characterized by increased numbers of macrophages in peripheral airways, lung parenchyma and pulmonary vessels, together with increased activated neutrophils and increased lymphocytes. Lung inflammation can persist after smoking cessation through as yet unclear mechanisms, although autoantigens and perturbations in the lung microbiome may play a role, and systemic inflammation may also be present and could play a role in the comorbid conditions frequently found in patients with COPD.

### Genetics of chronic respiratory disease [^114wzBAH]. Nature Reviews: Genetics (2024). High credibility.

Chronic respiratory diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma and interstitial lung diseases are frequently occurring disorders with a polygenic basis that account for a large global burden of morbidity and mortality. Recent large-scale genetic epidemiology studies have identified associations between genetic variation and individual respiratory diseases and linked specific genetic variants to quantitative traits related to lung function. These associations have improved our understanding of the genetic basis and mechanisms underlying common lung diseases. Moreover, examining the overlap between genetic associations of different respiratory conditions, along with evidence for gene-environment interactions, has yielded additional biological insights into affected molecular pathways. This genetic information could inform the assessment of respiratory disease risk and contribute to stratified treatment approaches.

COPD and aging — telomeres, epigenetics, and spirometric phenotypes: Age is commonly listed as a COPD risk factor due to physiologic lung function decline, and COPD shows features of accelerated aging. A prospective study linked accelerated telomere shortening with progressive worsening of gas exchange, lung hyperinflation, and extrapulmonary involvement over 10 years, with persistently shorter telomeres increasing all-cause mortality risk; age-related epigenetic changes in immune-cell DNA are also associated with increased exacerbation and mortality risk in COPD. In the Tasmanian Longitudinal Health Study, the mixed pattern (low forced vital capacity [FVC] and low FEV1/FVC) and obstructive-only pattern (low FEV1/FVC) had the highest COPD prevalence at age 53, at 37% and 22% respectively.

Identify and reduce exposure to risk factors in COPD — smoking and pollutants: Identification and reduction of exposure to risk factors is important not only for the primary prevention of COPD but also as part of the management of a COPD patient. Cigarette smoking is the most commonly encountered and easily identifiable risk factor for COPD, and smoking cessation should be continually encouraged for all individuals who smoke. Reduction of total personal exposure to occupational dusts, fumes, and gases, and to household and outdoor air pollutants, should also be addressed.

Genetic factors — familial risk and α-1 antitrypsin deficiency — contribute to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) susceptibility. The best documented genetic risk factor for COPD is mutations in SERPINA1 leading to hereditary α-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD). A European systematic review found AATD PiZZ genotypes in 0.12% of COPD patients (range 0.08–0.24%), with prevalence ranging from 1 in 408 in Northern Europe to 1 in 1,274 in Eastern Europe. For heterozygotes (MZ and SZ), careful sibling studies indicated no increased risk in the absence of smoking, although lung function was reduced in smokers compared to MZ siblings, and this is not an indication for augmentation therapy.

New Opportunities

COPD is a common, preventable, and treatable disease, but extensive underdiagnosis and misdiagnosis lead to patients' receiving no treatment or incorrect treatment. The realization that environmental factors other than tobacco smoking can contribute to COPD, that it can start early in life and affect young individuals, and that there are precursor conditions ("Pre-COPD", "PRISm"), opens new windows of opportunity for its prevention, early diagnosis, and prompt and appropriate therapeutic intervention. Importantly, several pharmacological and nonpharmacological therapies have now been shown to reduce mortality of COPD patients (Figure 6), but, in order to implement them, COPD must be diagnosed. Thus, any strategy aimed at addressing and improving the huge underdiagnosis of COPD in the community should be reinforced.

Asthma and airway hyper-reactivity — adults with asthma had a 12-fold higher risk of acquiring COPD over time compared to those without asthma, after adjusting for smoking; in another longitudinal cohort, around 20% developed irreversible airflow obstruction and reduced diffusing lung capacity, and in children with asthma, 11% met lung function impairment consistent with the spirometric classification of COPD in early adulthood. In the European Community Respiratory Health Survey, airway hyper-responsiveness was second only to cigarette smoking as a leading risk factor for COPD, responsible for 15% of the population attributable risk (smoking had a population attributable risk of 39%). Airway hyper-responsiveness can exist without a clinical diagnosis of asthma and has been shown to be an independent predictor of COPD and respiratory mortality in population studies, and the pathology of chronic airflow obstruction in asthmatic non-smokers and non-asthmatic smokers is markedly different.

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overview: epidemiology, risk factors, and clinical presentation [^112F4dNA]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2011). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has been a major public health problem during the 20th century, and will remain a challenge for the foreseeable future. Worldwide, COPD is in the spotlight, because its high prevalence, morbidity, and mortality create formidable challenges for healthcare systems. However, there remain many ongoing, contentious issues in COPD, including the definition and staging of COPD itself. Similarly, it appears that there is no consensus as yet on how, when, and where spirometry and other tools (symptoms assessment, imaging, biomarkers, and so on) should be conducted and implemented to screen, label, and treat for COPD, if any. Our current knowledge on the epidemiology, risk factors, and clinical presentation of COPD has been reasonably well documented in several previous reviews. We aim to summarize new developments surrounding the epidemiology of COPD, both at the population and at the clinical level, in comparison with other major burden contributors, while debating old and novel risk factors. Cigarette smoking is the principal causal factor, but other factors play a role in causing and triggering COPD. Likely, the clinical presentation of COPD and its contributing phenotypes within the remainder of the 21st century will be different than the "blue bloaters" and "pink puffers" observed one or two generations ago. Hopefully, the COPD clinical course will shift to better outcomes and prognosis than in the past.

Causes and risk factors

Traditionally, COPD has been considered a self-inflicted disease caused by tobacco smoking and occurring primarily in older males. This is a narrow and incomplete view, since COPD is similarly prevalent in men and women, and can be diagnosed in young individuals and even in never smokers. In fact, GOLD 2023 proposes that COPD is actually the end-result of a series of dynamic, cumulative and repeated gene (G)– environment (E) interactions over the lifetime (T) that damage the lungs and alter their normal development/aging processes. Below, we review the evidence supporting the influence of Genes, Environment and Time (GETomics) in the pathogenesis of COPD.

Genes

Mutations in SERPINA1 gene, leading to α-1 antitrypsin deficiency is the most relevant (albeit rare) genetic risk factor for COPD. Many other genetic variants have been recently identified as risk factors for reduced lung function and COPD, but their individual effect size is small. The prevalence of COPD in males and females in developed countries is now very similarbut some studies suggest more harmful effects of smoking among women. For instance, females report more dyspnoea and cough, have a steeper decline in lung function over time and have worse outcomes than males in terms of hospitalizations, respiratory failure, and death.

Environment

Cigarette smoking is a key environmental risk factor for COPD; yet fewer than 50% of heavy smokers develop COPDand, as discussed below, about a third of patients with COPD have never smoked. Passive smoking exposure also is a risk factor for COPD. Smoking during pregnancy poses a risk for the foetus, by altering lung growth and development in utero. In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), COPD in non-smokers may be responsible for up to 60–70% of cases. Wood, animal dung, crop residues, and coal (i.e. biomass), typically burned in poorly functioning stoves, may lead to very high levels of household air pollutionand increase the risk for COPD. COPD in non-smokers is more common in females of younger age. Symptoms and spirometric impairment are similar to those of smoking-induced COPD but emphysema is less prevalent and lung function decline less steep in non-smoking COPD. Research is needed to identify the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this type of COPD. Occupational exposures, including organic and inorganic dusts, chemical agents, and fumes, and air pollution also increases the risk of COPD.

### Toward precision medicine in COPD: phenotypes, endotypes, biomarkers, and treatable traits [^116rt3ZY]. Respiratory Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Behavioral/risk factor traits focus on modifiable health behaviors and environmental exposures. Smoking cessation support remains paramount, complemented by strategies to improve inhaler technique and medication adherence through patient education and regimen simplification. Physical inactivity requires structured pulmonary rehabilitation programs, while environmental exposures demand protective measures against pollutants and occupational hazards. Socioeconomic factors including health literacy deficits and social isolation necessitate tailored interventions through support networks and educational initiatives. Addressing these traits not only slows disease progression but also potentiates the effectiveness of other targeted therapies.

The GOLD guidelines recognize dyspnea and the occurrence of exacerbations as two pivotal identifiable and treatable traits in COPD. Both the COPD assessment Test (CAT) score and modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) scale serve as valuable biomarkers for quantifying breathlessness severity and informing therapeutic strategies. Based on these assessment tools, COPD-related dyspnea can be stratified into mild and severe symptom categories. Therapeutic objectives focus on alleviating respiratory distress, enhancing pulmonary function, improving exercise tolerance, and ultimately optimizing quality of life, with lung volume reduction surgery emerging as a potential consideration in selected cases. Acute exacerbations, characterized by abrupt symptom deterioration, present substantial clinical challenges in COPD management, with intervention strategies encompassing vaccination protocols, corticosteroid/bronchodilator (ICS/LABA/LAMA) regimens, and patient education for early symptom recognition.

Background

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a multifactorial clinical condition, mainly related to smoking, characterized by chronic respiratory symptoms, structural pulmonary abnormalities, impaired lung function, or a combination of these findings, and is often accompanied by multiple, clinically significant comorbidities. According to current data on pathogenesis, COPD derives from various lifelong, dynamic, and cumulative interactions between genomic and environmental factors, that modulate the development, maintenance, and function of the lungs, through various biological mechanisms, including but not limited to airways' and systemic inflammation. It is this diversity in the etiopathogenesis, pathophysiology and clinical manifestations that makes early, accurate diagnosis and management of COPD particularly challenging. Possibly this is also the reason for the notable variance in the reported prevalence of COPD throughout the world, as researchers use different sampling schemes, diagnostic criteria, and measurement modalities. Various sources of data are currently available on the epidemiological features of COPD, either for USA, China, Europe and worldwide.

In 2017 GOLD (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease) issued a new report for COPD diagnosis, management, and prevention. The goal of the GOLD assessment is to guide therapy based on the severity of airflow limitation as estimated by spirometry, the intensity of symptoms and the risk of future exacerbations or hospitalizations. Earlier GOLD guidelines used a simple spirometric grading system to classify COPD patients and determine optimal treatment. In 2011, this system was updated to also include the symptomatic assessment and the risk of exacerbation of each patient. The so-called "ABCD" tool combines the data from spirometry, the modified British Medical Research Council questionnaire (mMRC) or the COPD Assessment Test (CAT) and the history of patient's exacerbations to classify patients into four groups. It has been noted though, that this classification had some limitations. Firstly, the ABCD assessment tool performed no better than the spirometric grades for mortality prediction or other important health outcomes in COPD. Secondly, group "D" outcomes were modified by two parameters: lung function and/or exacerbation history, which caused confusion. Under this perspective, in 2017, a revision of the ABCD assessment tool was proposed that separated spirometric grades from the "ABCD" groups. Therefore, grading according to spirometry as well as group classification according to patient-reported symptoms (CAT and mMRC assessment) and exacerbations were reported for each patient.

### The genetics of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^1154VPDJ]. Respiratory Research (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterised by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible, which usually progresses, together with an abnormal inflammatory response to noxious particles or gases. Patients may have chronic bronchitis, emphysema, small airways disease or a combination of these, with or without systemic manifestations of the disease. This results in great variety within the patient population. It is not yet clear what the significance of each disease component is in terms of cause, or effect on management, though research into genetics and pathogenesis is starting to clarify this.

Although cigarette smoking is the main environmental risk factor for developing COPD, only about 15% of smokers develop clinically significant disease, suggesting that there are other influences on disease expression. Previous studies estimated that smoking contributes 15% to the variability of lung function, whilst genetic factors account for a further 40%. Family based studies support this: they have shown ancestral aggregation of spirometric measures in groups unselected for respiratory disease, and higher rates of airflow obstruction in first-degree relatives of patients with COPD. Moreover, the observation of differences in rate of decline of lung function between smokers suggests an interaction between genetic and environmental influences.

Pathogenesis: Causes and Risk Factors

COPD results from dynamic, cumulative, and repeated gene (G) - environment (E) interactions over the lifetime (T) that damage the lungs and/or alter their normal development/aging processes (GETomics).

Environmental Risk Factors

Cigarette smoking is a key environmental risk factor for COPD. Cigarette smokers have a higher prevalence of respiratory symptoms and lung function abnormalities, a greater annual rate of FEV 1 decline, and a greater COPD mortality rate than nonsmokers; yet fewer than 50% of heavy smokers develop COPD. Passive exposure to cigarette smoke, other types of tobacco smoke (e.g. pipe, cigar, water pipe), and marijuana are also risk factors for COPD. Smoking during pregnancy poses a risk for the fetus, by altering lung growth and development in utero, and possibly priming the immune system for abnormal/enhanced responses in the future.

In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), COPD in nonsmokers may be responsible for up to 60–70% of cases. Because the LMICs contribute to over 85% of all COPD cases, non-smoking risk factors account for over 50% of the global burden of COPD. Wood, animal dung, crop residues, and coal (i.e. biomass), typically burned in poorly functioning stoves, may lead to very high levels of household air pollution, which is associated with increased COPD risk, although the extent to which household air pollution versus other poverty-related exposures explains the association is unclear. Compared to COPD in smokers, COPD in nonsmokers is more common in females, of younger age, and exhibits similar (or milder) respiratory symptoms and quality-of-life impairment. They have similar spirometric indices but greater small airway obstruction, less emphysema, and a lesser rate of lung function decline. Finally, they show lower neutrophil count, higher eosinophil numbers in the sputum, and a similar defect in macrophage phagocytosis of pathogenic bacteria. Research is needed to understand how interventions aimed at decreasing household air pollution can reduce the risk of COPD as well as what is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this type of COPD.

COPD exacerbations — course, prognosis, and risk stratification — usually feature increased symptoms for 7 to 10 days, but some last longer; at 8 weeks up to 20% of patients will not have recovered to their pre-exacerbation state, exacerbations contribute to disease progression especially with slow recovery, and they can cluster with increased likelihood of another event. Some patients are susceptible to frequent exacerbations (defined as two or more exacerbations per year) with worse health status and morbidity; the strongest predictor of future frequency is the number of exacerbations in the prior year, and other associated risk factors/severity markers include an increased ratio of the pulmonary artery to aorta cross sectional dimension (i.e., ratio > 1), greater percentage of emphysema or airway wall thickness on chest CT, and chronic bronchitis.

### Early detection of COPD patients in GOLD 0 population: an observational non-interventional cohort study-MARKO study [^1123cMQH]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality globally, responsible for approximately 5 million deaths every year, with expected significant rise in mortality untill the year 2020. COPD mortality is low at age 45, but significantly rises after the age of 65 with significant comorbidity already present. COPD has a major economical and public health impact especially with regard to severe disease and exacerbations. Major risk factor for COPD development is tobacco smoke, although only less than 1/3 of smokers develop COPD during their lifetime. Because of its progressive nature COPD ends with early disability and mortality. Stopping or slowing down the progression of the disease is still an unmet need, although therapeutic interventions in COPD patients have shown to have significantly larger impact if they were started earlier in the course of the disease. An early diagnosis should allow for an early intervention, thus possibly preventing the progression of COPD, alleviating symptoms and improving general wellbeing, preventing complications and comorbidities and early mortality. The only available method for an early diagnosis that is suitable for screening purposes is spirometry (also used as the 'gold standard' for COPD diagnosis). Although screening on a global scale is not recommended by COPD guidelines, recommendations for early diagnosis (case finding) have been heavily advocated. New insights of the genetic background of COPD development have been revealed from cross-sectional large scale genetic studies but these data still need confirmation on a global scale using prospective data. On the other hand, symptoms and loss in health related quality of life (HRQoL) often precede diagnostically relevant loss of lung function (FEV 1 /FVC < 0.7 or < lower limit of normal [LLN]). Consequently we need new simple tools to detect patients in an early (pre)symptomatic stage of COPD before significant end organ damage. Based on these assumptions; the possibility of identifying the population at risk and the possibility of producing significant benefit for the patient if COPD is identified early, we decided to develop and test a new tool (to be used alone and in combination with other markers) in a prospective cohort study in a population at risk (smokers/ex-smokers with significant cumulative exposure to tobacco smoke, with no prior diagnosis of COPD). This new tool should be based on a prerequisite for a screening tool; usable on a global level, cheap, self-applicable, moderate to high sensitivity and high specificity (no false positives) for COPD. As existing HRQoL questionnaires are too complicated (Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire - CRQ, St. George Respiratory Questionnaire - SGRQ), and/or not developed for the purpose of early detection of COPD (Clinical COPD Questionnaire - CCQ, COPD Assessment Test - CAT), we have constructed, developed, and intend to validate a simple self-applicable questionnaire to detect early changes in HRQoL related to future COPD development.

### The genetics of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^113aC6BP]. Respiratory Research (2001). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a significant cause of global morbidity and mortality. Previous studies have shown that COPD aggregates in families, suggesting a genetic predisposition to airflow obstruction. Many candidate genes have been assessed, but the data are often conflicting. We review the genetic factors that predispose smokers to COPD and highlight the future role of genomic scans in identifying novel susceptibility genes.

GOLD 2025 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) report methodology — program history, update cycle, search strategy, and review process are specified as follows: The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) program was initiated in 1998; the first report was issued in 2001; complete revisions were prepared in 2006 and 2011; and the GOLD Science Committee was established in 2002 to review research and to post yearly updates. This 2025 GOLD Report is the second update of the 2023-revised report, and the 2023 GOLD Report was the 5th major revision. Updates of the 2017-revised report were made in 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022; updates of the 2011-revised report were released in January 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016. Evidence identification used a PubMed search with Committee-defined fields: 1) COPD or Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (All Fields) AND 2) Clinical Trials or Meta-analysis (All Fields) OR 3) articles in the top 20 medical or respiratory journals (available on request) or The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews; publications not captured by the search could be submitted in English. Each abstract is assigned to two unbiased Committee members, and reviewers answer four specific written questions to assess impact on recommendations and identify modifications; the GOLD Science Committee meets twice yearly to discuss potentially impactful publications, the full Committee reaches a consensus on inclusion or change to the report, and in the absence of consensus disagreements are decided by an open vote of the full Committee.

### Toward precision medicine in COPD: phenotypes, endotypes, biomarkers, and treatable traits [^114hQ1Mc]. Respiratory Research (2025). Medium credibility.

The 2023 GOLD report acknowledges the etiologic heterogeneity of COPD and introduces a novel classification methodology termed " etiotypes", which categorizes COPD based on predominant risk factors. The report classifies COPD into seven distinct etiologic subtypes: (1) genetically determined COPD (COPD-G), (2) COPD due to abnormal lung development (COPD-D; e.g. caused by early-life events), (3) cigarette smoking COPD (COPD-C), (4) biomass and pollution exposure COPD (COPD-P), (5) COPD due to infections (COPD-I; e.g. post-tuberculosis), (6) COPD with asthma (COPD-A), and (7) COPD of unknown cause (COPD-U). This taxonomic framework underscores the multifactorial nature of COPD pathogenesis across global populations. For example, non-smoking COPD (from biomass or repeated childhood infections) is highly prevalent in low- and middle-income countries. Distinct clinical phenotypes may characterize specific etiologic subtypes – for instance, biomass-associated COPD frequently manifests greater airway fibrosis with less emphysematous destruction compared to tobacco-related disease. However, clinical complexity arises from frequent etiologic subtype overlap (e.g. tobacco users with concomitant early-life developmental lung impairment), and the therapeutic implications of such multimorbidity remain undefined. Nonetheless, recognition of etiologic and geographic disparities proves critical for developing precision medicine strategies at a global scale. This paradigm reinforces the imperative for implementing clean energy cooking fuel initiatives (targeting biomass exposure mitigation) and early-life health preservation programs (optimizing pulmonary development) as integral components of comprehensive COPD prevention and management frameworks. Beyond energy transition and early-life lung development, optimizing asthma control and preventing respiratory infections, for example by vaccinating against influenza, pneumococcus, and RSV, are also pivotal levers across the life-course to reduce future COPD risk and acute exacerbations.

Box 1
COPD poses many diagnostic, prognostic and management challenges

A heterogeneous disease — with respect to symptoms, physiology, inflammation, extrapulmonary effects, response to treatment and disease trajectory, thus patients have variable responses to treatments.
Patient phenotypes can change during the course of COPD.
By the time COPD is diagnosed, the disease is overt and irreversible.
Many target proteins along the underlying biochemical and molecular pathways have yet to be identified.
The need to standardise blood and sputum eosinophil cut-off levels.

Two international meetings, facilitated by GlaxoSmithKline plc (online supplemental file A), involving respiratory medicine specialists, immunologists and primary/secondary care physicians, took place in November 2018 and March 2019. The aims were to reappraise available data to encourage scientific debate and discussion around the role of immune cells in the disease processes of COPD and as prognostic and diagnostic biomarkers, and to identify areas of scientific knowledge that are currently deficient and warrant further research. A significant proportion of the meetings focused on the utility of eosinophil-related biomarkers and the identification of clinical biomarkers relevant for COPD. The potential of such a biomarker was discussed in terms of contribution to the assessment of patients, risk prediction, treatment guidance and assessment of response. The attendees' views on key topics, contextualised with current literature, are summarised in this review article, with the aim of aiding ongoing research into the disease processes of COPD and the development of biomarkers to aid clinical management.

Development of COPD

Little is known about the early onset of COPD, nor the potential role of eosinophils in this process. Clearly, it takes decades for the disease to develop. Exposure to noxious particles/gases (eg, via smoking, household wood burners, fires or environmental pollutants) is the main risk factor for COPD, although host factors (eg, genetic background, abnormal lung development and accelerated ageing) are also known to predispose individuals to COPD. As only a small fraction of smokers (10%–20%) develop COPD, other factors must also be involved; indeed, some life-long non-smokers go on to develop COPD-like pathophysiology. Poverty is consistently associated with airflow obstructionand individuals of lower socioeconomic status are more likely to develop COPD. Asthma and airway hyper-responsiveness (without asthma) are also risk factors for COPD. The underlying mechanisms of COPD, including the relative contributions of neutrophil-mediated and/or eosinophil-mediated inflammation, likely differ dependent on a patient's specific disease subtype.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^1171okTx]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Environmental risk factors — cigarette smoking and COPD risk: Cigarette smoking is a key environmental risk factor for COPD, and cigarette smokers have a higher prevalence of respiratory symptoms and lung function abnormalities, a greater annual rate of decline in FEV1, and a greater COPD mortality rate than non-smokers. Most COPD studies have included patients with a cigarette exposure of a minimum of 10 pack-years, yet one study has suggested that even at reduced smoking exposure (< 10 pack-years) the 5-year risk of developing COPD is increased in middle-aged adults, with increased risk of severe exacerbation and early death. Nonetheless, fewer than 50% of heavy smokers develop COPD and it is estimated that half of all COPD cases worldwide are due to risk factors other than tobacco, and genetics modify the risk of COPD in smokers with additional influences including gender, social pressure, and socioeconomic status linked to birthweight that may impact lung growth and development.

COPD definition and causes — chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous lung condition with chronic respiratory symptoms due to airway and/or alveolar abnormalities causing persistent, often progressive, airflow obstruction; COPD results from gene–environment–time interactions, with key environmental exposures including tobacco smoking and inhalation of toxic particles and gases from household and outdoor air pollution, and host factors, while mutations in the SERPINA1 gene leading to α1-antitrypsin deficiency are the most relevant (though epidemiologically rare) genetic risk factor and other low-effect genetic variants are associated with reduced lung function and COPD risk.

### What can genetics tell us about the cause of fixed airflow obstruction? [^115Psr2w]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2012). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major cause of chronic morbidity and mortality worldwide with smoking being the most important risk factor of the disease. However, lung function and COPD are known to also have a genetic component and a deeper knowledge of the genetic architecture of the disease could lead to further understanding of predisposition to COPD and also to development of new therapeutic interventions. Genetic linkage studies and candidate gene association studies have not provided evidence to convincingly identify the genes underlying lung function or COPD. However, recent large genome-wide association studies (GWAS) including tens of thousands of individuals have identified 26 variants at different loci in the human genome that show robust association with quantitative lung function measures in the general population. A growing number of these variants are being shown to be associated with COPD. Following the identification of these new lung function loci, the challenge now lies in refining the signals to identify the causative variants underlying the association signals and relating these signals to the molecular pathways that underlie lung function.

Background — global burden of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) notes that COPD is one of the top three causes of death worldwide and 90% of these deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). More than 3 million people died of COPD in 2012 accounting for 6% of all deaths globally. COPD represents an important public health challenge that is both preventable and treatable, and the COPD burden is projected to increase in coming decades because of continued exposure to COPD risk factors and aging of the population.

Therapeutic interventions that reduce COPD mortality — chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the third leading cause of death worldwide, causing 3.23 million deaths in 2019, and a large clinical database study indicates the highest magnitude of risk of all-cause mortality, COPD- and CVD-related mortality in individuals with increased severity and frequency of COPD exacerbations, GOLD groups B and D, and those with lower FEV1 (particularly GOLD 3 and 4). Demonstrating mortality benefits in randomized controlled trials has been difficult, requiring large populations and/or long follow-up duration and/or highly selected populations with a high but preventable risk of death during follow-up, and the low number of events makes the analysis of disease specific mortality in most trials difficult.

Non-smoking COPD evidence and indoor air interventions — there are no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that have addressed the appropriate pharmacotherapy of non-smoking COPD, and there is therefore an urgent need to conduct robust RCTs to better understand the most effective treatment. Phenotypic differences between smoking and non-smoking COPD have been reported in only a few studies. There is evidence from the SPIROMICS cohort study that the association of indoor PM2.5 with annual forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) decline differed by smoking status; among people with, or at risk of, COPD former smokers living in high PM2.5 homes had rates of lung function decline similar to current smokers, whereas in low PM2.5 homes lung function decline was similar to never smokers. A small RCT has shown that in-home use of portable particulate air cleaners may help to improve outcomes such as moderate exacerbation risk and breathlessness, with people who spend more time indoors more likely to benefit.

Multimorbidity — People with COPD often have concomitant chronic diseases across mild, moderate or severe airflow obstruction; multimorbidity influences mortality and hospitalizations independently of the severity of airflow obstruction and deserves specific treatment. Therefore, comorbid conditions should be looked for routinely, and treated appropriately if present, in any patient with COPD, and recommendations for diagnosis, assessment of severity, and management of individual comorbid diseases are the same as for patients without COPD. Frequent multimorbid diseases in COPD include cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, osteoporosis, depression and anxiety, and whether the association between COPD and lung cancer is due to common risk factors, shared susceptibility genes and/or impaired clearance of carcinogens is unclear. COPD can also have significant extrapulmonary effects including weight loss, nutritional abnormalities, and skeletal muscle dysfunction characterized by sarcopenia and abnormal function of the remaining cells; causes are likely multifactorial and can contribute to exercise intolerance and poor health status.

Introduction

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by persistent respiratory symptoms and progressive airflow obstruction and is associated with high rates of hospitalization and hospital length of stay (LOS). The most common causes include tobacco smoke, environmental exposures and genetic (inherited) risk. According to the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guideline, acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD) is defined as an event characterized by increased dyspnea and/or cough and sputum that worsens in < 14 days, which may be accompanied by tachypnea and/or tachycardia and is always involved in more severe health conditions and more radical treatment. The mortality related to AECOPD rises from 4.5 to 25.4% with increased severity of AECOPD. AECOPD is now one of the top three causes of death worldwide, and it is estimated that there will be over 5.4 million annual deaths from AECOPD and related conditions by 2060.

### Preventing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: what is known and what needs to be done to make a difference to the patient? [^1122Przq]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a preventable and treatable systemic disease with symptoms that overlap other respiratory illnesses. An estimated 24 million adults in the United States have COPD, but > 50% of them are misdiagnosed or undiagnosed. Spirometry remains the "gold standard" for diagnosing COPD and for monitoring the progression of the disease. Cigarette smoking is the main cause of COPD; therefore, smoking cessation is an integral component of any program to reduce COPD risk and delay or limit the progression of airflow obstruction. Influenza vaccinations will also reduce acute respiratory illness in patients with COPD. With increasing awareness of COPD and earlier diagnosis, implementation of treatment guidelines and smoking-cessation efforts may lead to more effective management of this disease, which is projected to be the third leading cause of death in the United States by 2020.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: GOLD executive summary [^114G6Ah7]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) remains a major public health problem. It is the fourth leading cause of chronic morbidity and mortality in the United States, and is projected to rank fifth in 2020 in burden of disease worldwide, according to a study published by the World Bank/World Health Organization. Yet, COPD remains relatively unknown or ignored by the public as well as public health and government officials. In 1998, in an effort to bring more attention to COPD, its management, and its prevention, a committed group of scientists encouraged the U.S. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and the World Health Organization to form the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD). Among the important objectives of GOLD are to increase awareness of COPD and to help the millions of people who suffer from this disease and die prematurely of it or its complications. The first step in the GOLD program was to prepare a consensus report, Global Strategy for the Diagnosis, Management, and Prevention of COPD, published in 2001. The present, newly revised document follows the same format as the original consensus report, but has been updated to reflect the many publications on COPD that have appeared. GOLD national leaders, a network of international experts, have initiated investigations of the causes and prevalence of COPD in their countries, and developed innovative approaches for the dissemination and implementation of COPD management guidelines. We appreciate the enormous amount of work the GOLD national leaders have done on behalf of their patients with COPD. Despite the achievements in the 5 years since the GOLD report was originally published, considerable additional work is ahead of us if we are to control this major public health problem. The GOLD initiative will continue to bring COPD to the attention of governments, public health officials, health care workers, and the general public, but a concerted effort by all involved in health care will be necessary.

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and related phenotypes: polygenic risk scores in population-based and case-control cohorts [^113vMvNA]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterised by irreversible airflow limitation. The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) defines COPD by the presence of persistent respiratory symptoms with airflow obstruction based on a low FEV 1 /forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio, and grades spirometric severity on the basis of decrements in post-bronchodilator percentage of predicted FEV 1 (% predicted).COPD primarily develops in the context of toxic environmental exposures, including cigarette smoking and biofuel combustion. However, not all exposed individuals develop airflow obstruction, which suggests that some individuals could have a genetic susceptibility to the disease.

Heritability estimates for COPD typically range between 37% and 50%. Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of COPD and lung function have identified numerous genetic variants associated with COPD risk. The effect size of each of these GWAS variants is generally small. However, although each individual variant only explains a small proportion of COPD risk, the combination of many genetic variants into a single genetic risk score explains a greater proportion of the risk. Genetic risk scores have been developed for lung function, with predictive power for COPD. Genetic risk scores based on larger GWASs, and including more variants, tend to exhibit higher predictive performance.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

We searched PubMed for studies published up to Sept 28, 2019, using the terms "COPD", "genetic", "risk score", "COPD", and "gwa study", with no language restrictions. Previous research has shown that COPD is influenced by genetic factors, but variants identified by genome-wide association studies (GWASs) are of individually small effect, and account for a modest fraction of genetic risk. Studies combining these variants showed improved risk prediction, but no studies have attempted to include full genome-wide results.

Added value of this study

We developed a polygenic risk score using a large GWAS of lung function. This risk score predicted COPD in multiple cohorts, and is associated with a wide range of CT imaging phenotypes and lung growth patterns that are thought to be linked to the development of COPD.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) phenotyping — A phenotype is the observable properties (i.e., phenotypic traits) of an organism, which are determined by its genotype and modulated by its environment. A clinical COPD phenotype has been defined as "A single or combination of disease attributes that describe differences between individuals with COPD as they relate to clinically meaningful outcomes (e.g., symptoms, exacerbations, response to therapy, rate of disease progression, or death)". Only a few COPD phenotypes have been validated, including α1-antitrypsin deficiency, frequent (two or more per year) exacerbations, chronic bronchitis, and upper lobe emphysema with poor exercise tolerance after rehabilitation in patients with severe airflow limitation.

Screening and case-finding — indications and approaches: The role of screening spirometry for the diagnosis of COPD in the general population is controversial. In asymptomatic individuals without any significant exposures to tobacco or other risk factors, screening spirometry is probably not indicated; whereas in those with symptoms or risk factors (e.g., > 20 pack-years of smoking, recurrent chest infections, early life events), the diagnostic yield for COPD is relatively high and spirometry should be considered as a method for early case finding. Both FEV1 and FVC predict all-cause mortality independent of tobacco smoking, but data to support that population-based screening spirometry is effective in directing management decisions or in improving COPD outcomes in patients who are identified before the development of significant symptoms is weak. An randomized controlled trial (RCT) using community case-finding reported that symptomatic individuals with undiagnosed COPD who received treatment by a pulmonologist and an educator had fewer respiratory events over one year and showed improvements in symptoms, lung function, and disease-specific quality of life, and these results suggest that such an approach, leading to early diagnosis and treatment of symptomatic COPD results in better clinical outcomes. GOLD advocates active case finding, i.e., performing spirometry in patients with symptoms and/or risk factors, but not screening spirometry, and systematic active case-finding in a primary care setting via mail-out of a screening questionnaire was also found to be an effective way to identify undiagnosed COPD patients.

### An official American Thoracic Society public policy statement: novel risk factors and the global burden of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^116iwRv6]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Rationale

Although cigarette smoking is the most important cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a substantial proportion of COPD cases cannot be explained by smoking alone.

Objectives

To evaluate the risk factors for COPD besides personal cigarette smoking.

Methods

We constituted an ad hoc subcommittee of the American Thoracic Society Environmental and Occupational Health Assembly. An international group of members was invited, based on their scientific expertise in a specific risk factor for COPD. For each risk factor area, the committee reviewed the literature, summarized the evidence, and developed conclusions about the likelihood of it causing COPD. All conclusions were based on unanimous consensus.

Measurements and Main Results

The population-attributable fraction for smoking as a cause of COPD ranged from 9.7 to 97.9%, but was less than 80% in most studies, indicating a substantial burden of disease attributable to nonsmoking risk factors. On the basis of our review, we concluded that specific genetic syndromes and occupational exposures were causally related to the development of COPD. Traffic and other outdoor pollution, secondhand smoke, biomass smoke, and dietary factors are associated with COPD, but sufficient criteria for causation were not met. Chronic asthma and tuberculosis are associated with irreversible loss of lung function, but there remains uncertainty about whether there are important phenotypic differences compared with COPD as it is typically encountered in clinical settings.

Conclusions

In public health terms, a substantive burden of COPD is attributable to risk factors other than smoking. To prevent COPD-related disability and mortality, efforts must focus on prevention and cessation of exposure to smoking and these other, less well-recognized risk factors.

Occupational exposures, including organic and inorganic dusts, chemical agents, and fumes, are an underappreciated environmental risk factor for COPD. The US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III estimated the fraction of COPD attributable to workplace exposures was 19.2% overall, and 31.1% among never-smokers.

Air pollution, which typically consists of particulate matter (PM), ozone, oxides of nitrogen or sulfur, heavy metals, and other greenhouse gases, is a major worldwide cause of COPD, responsible for ∼50% of the attributable risk for COPD in LMICs. The risk of air pollution to individuals is dose-dependent, with no apparent "safe" threshold. Even in countries with relatively low ambient air pollution, chronic exposure to PM < 2.5 microns and nitrogen dioxides significantly impairs lung growth in children, accelerates lung function decline in adults, and increases the risk for COPD, especially among those with additional risk factors. Air pollution also increases the risk of COPD exacerbations, hospitalizations, and mortality.

Genetic Risk Factors

The most relevant genetic risk factor for COPD identified are mutations in SERPINA1, leading to α-1 antitrypsin deficiency, a major circulating inhibitor of serine proteases. The PiZZ genotype affects 0.12% of COPD patients, and its prevalence ranges from 1 in 408 in Northern Europe to 1 in 1,274 in Eastern Europe. There is no increased COPD risk in heterozygotes (MZ and SZ) in the absence of smoking.

Other genetic variants have also been associated with reduced lung function and risk of COPD; their individual effect size is small, although their co-occurrence may increase disease susceptibility.

Alpha-1 antitrypsin augmentation therapy in alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) has been available in many, though not all, countries since the 1980s, and observational studies suggest a reduction in spirometric progression in treated versus non-treated patients with this reduction most effective for patients with FEV1 35% to 49% predicted; never or ex-smokers with an FEV1 of 35% to 60% predicted have been suggested as those most suitable for AATD augmentation therapy (Evidence B). Available clinical trial and registry data have almost exclusively been focussed on patients with the ZZ (ZZ-AATD/PIZZ) genotype; people with the Z/null or null/null genotypes have even lower levels of plasma AAT and are usually assessed for augmentation therapy, whereas other genotypes are not considered at risk or likely to benefit; recent studies have suggested an increased risk of developing mild COPD in heterozygotes for the Z gene although unlike ZZ neither develop COPD in the absence of smoking, so smoking cessation is thought to prevent progression and hence augmentation is not necessary or appropriate. Studies using sensitive parameters of emphysema progression determined by computed tomography (CT) scans have provided evidence for an effect on preserving lung tissue compared to placebo.

Morbidity in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) — Morbidity measures traditionally include physician visits, emergency department visits, and hospitalizations; studies indicate that morbidity due to COPD increases with age, and in patients with COPD the development of comorbidities is seen at an earlier age; morbidity in COPD may also be influenced by concomitant chronic conditions related to smoking, aging and/or COPD.

Introduction

Chronic respiratory diseases are a leading cause of morbidity, mortality, and disability worldwide. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the 3rd leading cause of mortality worldwide. In the United States (US), the estimated prevalence of asthma and COPD in adults is 9.2% and 6.5%, respectively. In Pakistan, a South Asian lower-middle-income country (LMIC), the prevalence of asthma in adults may be as high as 11.3% and COPD as high as 13.8%. Notable risk factors for chronic respiratory illnesses in Pakistan include exposure to environmental pollution, carbon emissions, excessive indoor air conditioner use, mosquito coil use, and high rates of smoking.

Evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (EBCPGs) assist the diagnosis and management of chronic respiratory conditions. Currently, most EBCPGs followed globally, such as the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines and the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines, are created by institutions in high-income countries in the West. LMICs, like Pakistan, usually lack the research infrastructure and financial resources to independently created EBCPGs de novo for their own healthcare context, and instead adapt those already developed by Western countries. However, the application of such EBCPGs in Pakistan presents a problem, as the landscape of respiratory conditions differs in many aspects. These include but are not limited to epidemiology, genetic variability, healthcare financing and access, triggers and risk factors, socio-cultural influences, disease related awareness. In addition, there is a lack of specialist pulmonologists in Pakistan, particularly in rural areas. Thus, the role of the general practitioner (GP) in the diagnosis and management of chronic respiratory diseases is especially important in Pakistan.

COPD as part of multi-morbidity should be recognized since an increasing number of people in any aging population will suffer from multi-morbidity, defined as the presence of two or more chronic conditions, and COPD is present in most multi-morbid patients; multi-morbid patients have symptoms from multiple diseases and thus symptoms and signs are complex and most often attributable to several causes in the chronic state as well as during acute events; there is no evidence that COPD should be treated differently when part of multi-morbidity, but it should be kept in mind that most evidence comes from trials in people with COPD as the only significant disease; treatments should be kept simple in the light of the unbearable polypharmacy that these patients are often exposed to.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, more specifically with respect to diagnosis, GOLD 2025 guidelines recommend to recognize that:

- COPD is a heterogeneous lung condition characterized by chronic respiratory symptoms (dyspnea, cough, sputum production, exacerbations) due to abnormalities of the airways (bronchitis, bronchiolitis) and/or alveoli (emphysema) causing persistent, often progressive, airflow obstruction

- COPD results from gene-environment interactions occurring over the lifetime of the individual that can damage the lungs and/or alter their normal development/aging processes

- the main environmental exposures leading to COPD are tobacco smoking and the inhalation of toxic particles and gases from household and outdoor air pollution, but other environmental and host factors (including abnormal lung development and accelerated lung aging) can also contribute

- the most relevant (albeit rare) genetic risk factor for COPD identified to date are mutations in the SERPINA1 gene leading to α-1 antitrypsin deficiency; a number of other genetic variants have also been associated with reduced lung function and risk of COPD, but their individual effect size is small.

Treatable traits — To address the heterogeneity and complexity of COPD in clinical practice, a strategy based on so-called 'Treatable Traits' (TTs) has been proposed. TTs can be identified based on phenotypic recognition and/or on deep understanding of critical causal pathways (endotypes) through validated biomarkers, for example high circulating eosinophil levels identify COPD patients at risk of exacerbations in whom treatment with inhaled corticosteroid is most effective. TTs can co-exist in the same patient and change with time (spontaneously or because of treatment), and GOLD highlights the role of two key TTs (persistent dyspnea and exacerbations) in the follow up algorithm of pharmacological treatment while noting there are many more pulmonary and extra-pulmonary traits, as well as behavioral/social risk factors, that merit individual attention and treatment if present.

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease guidelines in Europe: a look into the future [^116HiLxK]. Respiratory Research (2018). Low credibility.

There is potential for significant alleviation of time and budget constraints through a concerted, collaborative effort between European countries. Who should take the lead during such a collaboration remains to be discussed, but it is likely that the European Respiratory Society (ERS) is in the best position to lead such a project. The ERS is committed to the development of high quality CPGs, and either alone or in concert with sister societies such as the American Thoracic Society (ATS), has also delivered evidence-based CPGs for the management of COPD. Developing a European collaboration would be best achieved through the ERS and national societies, agreeing on a common methodology. Tight links with the GOLD group could also be useful to share retrieved evidence and increase reactivity, allowing a continuous update and adaptation process.

Can COPD guidelines be simplified?

There is an apparent contradiction between the exponential increase in the scientific knowledge of COPD complexity (phenotypes, endotypes, comorbidities etc.) and the need for simplified treatment pathways. Complex raw data needs to be aggregated and translated into meaningful, useful information to support recommendations of new treatments. Algorithms may be helpful to guide COPD therapy in a simple, stepwise and coordinated manner. Such algorithms need to be flexible and continuously evolving in order to remain up-to-date and clinically relevant. Importantly, the availability of algorithms does not negate the need for scientific principles, and the role of clinical judgement should always be acknowledged.

Pathogenesis of COPD — gene–environment–time interactions: COPD is the end-result of complex, cumulative and dynamic gene-environment interactions over the lifetime that can damage the lungs and/or alter their normal developmental or aging processes. The term GETomics has been recently proposed to illustrate the complex and dynamic series of interactions between Genetics and Environment over Time, and according to this GETomics proposal, the end result of a given GxE interaction depends not only on G and E, but also on T, as determined by both the age of the individual at which that particular interaction occurs (development vs aging) and the previous history of GxE interactions that the individual has encountered earlier in her/his life (biological memory).

Diagnosis: Forced Spirometry

A diagnosis of COPD should be considered in any patient who complains of dyspnea, chronic cough or sputum production, a history of recurrent lower respiratory tract infections, and/or a history of exposure to risk factors for the disease (see above), but forced vital capacity maneuver during spirometry showing the presence of a post-bronchodilator FEV 1 /FVC ratio < 0.7 is needed to establish the diagnosis of COPD. The FEV 1 also serves to determine the severity of airflow obstruction (GOLD grades 1, 2, 3, 4 or mild, moderate, severe, and very severe). Yet, several important aspects related to forced spirometry need to be considered here.

First, airflow obstruction that is not fully reversible is not specific for COPD. For instance, it may also be found in patients with asthma and other diseases, so the clinical context and risk factors (see above) must also be considered when establishing a diagnosis of COPD.

The most important GOLD objective is raising awareness that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is an increasing health problem. The first step in the GOLD program was to prepare a consensus report, named "Global Strategy for the Diagnosis, Management, and Prevention of COPD", based on best-validated evidence and current pathogenetic and clinical knowledge. It encourages implementation of effective strategies for prevention, diagnosis, and management of the disease in all countries, and emphasizes the importance of renewed research initiatives.

The Global Initiative for chronic Obstructive Lung disease (GOLD) guideline of 2018 describes COPD as 'the result of a complex interplay of long-term cumulative exposure to noxious gases and particles, combined with a variety of host factors including genetics, airway hyper-responsiveness and poor lung growth during childhood'. Tobacco smoking is traditionally viewed as the main contributing factor to the development of COPD. However, COPD also occurs among non-smokers, especially in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). Notably, more than 90% of COPD-related deaths occur in LMICs. For these countries, other risk factors, such as ambient, occupational and household air pollution play a significant role in the development of COPD.– Does COPD in these settings have a different pathophysiological trajectory compared to COPD in high-income countries, and if so: what does this imply?

In normal lung development, airway branching is completed by the 17th week of gestation, after which airways increase in volume until young adulthood. Alveoli are present at birth and develop further during childhood. Lung volume and airflow continue to increase as the thorax grows, influenced by age, sex, and ethnicity, reaching a peak at young adulthood. Lung function then remains constant for about 10 years (the plateau phase), after which it gradually declines. In the 'classic' COPD patient, the decline in lung function is more rapid than in healthy individuals. However, in a considerable proportion of COPD patients, lung function does not decline rapidly, but reaches a lower plateau phase in early adulthood instead. For these patients, a completely different pathophysiological trajectory seems to lead to the diagnosis of COPD: the decline in lung function follows a normal pattern, yet they seem to have a 'false start' by attaining a lower maximum lung function. –

Introduction

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is defined by the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) as "a common, preventable and treatable disease that is characterised by persistent respiratory symptoms and airflow limitation that is due to airway and/or alveolar abnormalities usually caused by significant exposure to noxious particles or gases". The chief constituents of COPD are emphysema which is a permanent destructive enlargement of airspaces, and chronic bronchitis which is an excretion of sputum for at least 3 months per year for 2 successive years. Ageing, occupational exposure to dust and fumes, indoor and outdoor air pollutants, genetic risk factors and especially tobacco smoking are some of the risk factors for developing COPD. In the primary stages of the disease, the physical symptoms include a chronic cough, excessive sputum excretion, wheezing and shortness of breath and as the disease develops, dyspnea becomes more common. Mental conditions, such as anxiety and depression, are also common comorbidities of COPD and these predict a diminished quality of life, decreased exercise capacity and higher rates of exacerbations, along with increased mortality.

COPD has a considerable economic burden, such that in 2011 the yearly direct (i.e. healthcare) and indirect (i.e. production loss) cost of COPD in Europe was 48.4 billion euros. The economic costs of COPD are mostly due to the hospitalization and medication costs and are strongly influenced by the stage of the disease, as well as the severity and frequency of acute exacerbations. COPD is one of the most common causes of mortality and morbidity, and has the highest death rate of all chronic respiratory diseases globally. According to the latest information from the Global Burden of Diseases (GBD) 2019, COPD attributable DALYs ranked 11th in 1990 and 6th in 2019, although the age-standardised DALY rate per 100,000 population decrease by 39.8% during this time period. It has been estimated that COPD affected more than 380 million people globally in 2010, with a higher prevalence in males. Furthermore, the age-standardised prevalence rate of COPD increases with advancing age and in the future is expected to become equal among males and females, mostly due to changes occurring in the smoking habits of females.

### Global, regional, and national prevalence of, and risk factors for, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in 2019: a systematic review and modelling analysis [^117A7bsv]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Although ambient particulate matter and smoking accounted for more than 70% of DALYs due to COPD, and air pollution and other environmental factors are increasingly becoming major risks for COPD in LMICs, we could not estimate direct risk from ambient air pollution because it was poorly defined across studies. Moreover, although COPD and its severity result from a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors, ethnicity could not be explored in our analysis because prevalence and risk measures by ethnicity were provided mainly by studies in the USA.

Our findings have important implications for policy and research. Smoking remains the single most important risk factor for COPD. Careful characterisation of smoking patterns across different age groups and implementation of strict measures are needed to address this issue. Although understanding of the epidemiology of COPD remains poor in several LMICs, implementation of WHO's Framework Convention for Tobacco Control, which has been ratified by 180 members representing 90% of world population, will be crucial to reduce the global burden of COPD. Efforts should focus on LMICs, where the burden is highest, strict measures to address a gradually growing tobacco industry are not in place, and many young populations are now active smokers. Many countries need to intensify efforts, involving physicians, others health workers, and counselling and support groups, in the management of tobacco dependence, which is evidence-based, particularly for those willing to quit. Given the limitations of data from population-based studies, experts need to work on standardised methods of collating clinical data that would be useful for epidemiological purposes. As a global respiratory health unit, we recommend the inclusion of pack-years in any clinical history of breathlessness or cough. Misdiagnosis of COPD needs to be addressed, particularly through provision and training of health-care providers in the correct use of spirometry. This is especially important in sub-Saharan Africa and South-East Asia, where numbers of undiagnosed cases are highest. Moreover, training and clear guidance should be provided to individualise care in pulmonary rehabilitation, which has been shown to be effective in the treatment of COPD.

COPD is among the most neglected diseases globally, receiving little attention from health-care providers and policy makers despite being a leading contributor to the global burden of disease (both premature mortality and disability). Although the efforts of groups such as the BOLD initiative and PLATINO, and international respiratory organisations such as the European Respiratory Society and the American Thoracic Society have yielded considerable progress in understanding of the global COPD burden, international consensus on the epidemiological definition of COPD and standardised guidelines and data collection for population-based surveys are needed.

### Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: common genes, common environments? [^111n27Qz]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) show similarities and substantial differences. The Dutch hypothesis stipulated that asthma and COPD have common genetic and environmental risk factors (allergens, infections, smoking), which ultimately lead to clinical disease depending on the timing and type of environmental exposures (Postma and Boezen, Chest 2004;126:96S-104S). Thus, a particular group of shared genetic factors may lead to asthma when combined with specific environmental factors that are met at a certain stage in life, whereas combination with other environmental factors, or similar environmental factors at a different stage in life, will lead toward COPD. Multiple genes have been found for asthma and COPD. In addition to genes unique to these diseases, some shared genetic risk factors exist. Moreover, there are both common host risk factors and environmental risk factors for asthma and COPD. Here we put forward, based on the data available, that genes that affect lung development in utero and lung growth in early childhood in interaction with environmental detrimental stimuli, such as smoking and air pollution, are contributing to asthma in childhood and the ultimate development of COPD. Additional genes and environmental factors then drive specific immunological mechanisms underlying asthma, and others may contribute to the ultimate development of specific subtypes of COPD (i.e., airway disease with mucous hypersecretion, small airway disease, and emphysema). The genetic predisposition to the derailment of certain pathways may further help to define subgroups of asthma and COPD. In the end this may lead to stratification of patients by their genetic make-up and open new therapeutic prospects.

### Genetics of COPD and emphysema [^114Sw95G]. Chest (2009). Low credibility.

COPD is a highly prevalent disorder that results from the interplay of genetic susceptibility and environmental exposures. Over the past 2 decades, significant technological advances have been made in genetic investigations of complex diseases, yet limited progress has been made in the identification of additional COPD susceptibility genes. Genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity, limited power due to modest study population sizes, and significant modification of genetic effects by environmental factors pose significant challenges in COPD and emphysema genetic studies. More refined characterization of the emphysema and airway components of COPD can now be obtained through the systematic use of CT scans. These improved phenotypes can be applied in genome-wide association studies and will likely lead to the discovery of additional susceptibility loci and therapeutic targets.

Guidelines released in 2001 from the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) are aimed at redressing this inequity. In this review, we integrate information from the GOLD guidelines with recent updates on the prevention, treatment and management as related specifically to the most severe form of this disease. In order to help distinguish COPD from other disorders that may mimic or confound its treatment, we place particular emphasis on the definition, underlying pathophysiology and diagnosis of COPD. In addition, we discuss future directions in pharmacotherapy.

### How to integrate multiple comorbidities in guideline development: article 10 in integrating and coordinating efforts in COPD guideline development. An official ATS / ERS workshop report [^111WpWau]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Professional societies, like many other organizations around the world, have recognized the need to use more rigorous processes to ensure that health care recommendations are informed by the best available research evidence. This is the 10th of a series of 14 articles that were prepared to advise guideline developers in respiratory and other diseases. This article deals with how multiple comorbidities (co-existing chronic conditions) may be more effectively integrated into guidelines.

Methods

In this review we addressed the following topics and questions using chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as an example. (1) How important are multiple comorbidities for guidelines? (2) How have other organizations involved in the development of guidelines for single chronic disease approached the problem of multiple comorbidities? (3) What are the implications of multiple comorbidities for pharmacological treatment? (4) What are the potential changes induced by multiple comorbidities in guidelines? (5) What are the implications of considering a population of older patients with multiple comorbidities in designing clinical trials? Our conclusions are based on available evidence from the published literature, experience from guideline developers, and workshop discussions. We did not attempt to examine all Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs) and relevant literature. Instead, we selected CPGs generated by prominent professional organizations and relevant literature published in widely read journals, which are likely to have a high impact on clinical practice.

Results and Conclusions

A widening gap exists between the reality of the care of patients with multiple chronic conditions and the practical clinical recommendations driven by CPGs focused on a single disease, such as COPD. Guideline development panels should aim for multidisciplinary representation, especially when contemplating recommendations for individuals aged 65 years or older (who often have multiple comorbidities), and should evaluate the quality of evidence and the strength of recommendations targeted at this population. A priority area for research should be to assess the effect of multiple concomitant medications and assess how their combined effects are altered by genetic, physiological, disease-related, and other factors. One step that should be implemented immediately would be for existing COPD guidelines to add new sections to address the impact of multiple comorbidities on screening, diagnosis, prevention, and management recommendations. Research should focus on the possible interaction of multiple medications. Furthermore, genetic, physiological, disease-related, and other factors that may influence the directness (applicability) of the evidence for the target population in clinical practice guidelines should be examined.

Fourth, while post-bronchodilator spirometry is required for the diagnosis and assessment of COPD, assessing the degree of reversibility of airflow obstruction to inform therapeutic decisions is no longer recommended. The degree of reversibility in a single patient varies over time and has not been shown to differentiate COPD from asthma (except when airflow limitation disappears following bronchodilators, which is incompatible with COPD), or to predict the response to long-term treatment with bronchodilators or corticosteroids. Accordingly, it is not necessary nor advised to stop inhaled medication before obtaining spirometry measurements during follow-up of patients.

Finally, the role of screening spirometry in the general population for the diagnosis of COPD is also controversial. In asymptomatic individuals without any significant exposure to tobacco or other risk factors, screening spirometry is probably not indicated. By contrast, in those with symptoms and/or risk factors (e.g. > 20 pack-years of smoking, recurrent chest infections, prematurity, or other significant early-life events), the diagnostic yield for COPD is relatively high, and spirometry should be considered as a method for case finding.

### The epidemiology and economics of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^115dCNqt]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2007). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a preventable and treatable disease responsible for a large human and economic burden around the world. Cigarette smoking is the main risk factor for COPD in the developed world, although other important risk factors include occupational exposures, air pollution, airway hyperresponsiveness, asthma, and genetic predisposition. In most of the world, COPD prevalence and mortality continue to rise in response to increases in smoking, particularly by women and adolescents. COPD is also an important cause of disability, and is linked to comorbid diseases, such as depression and cardiovascular disease, which adds to the large economic burden associated with this disorder. Better public health and medical interventions that target both the risk factors for COPD and look toward earlier intervention may decrease the growing public health impact of COPD.

Background

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous lung condition that includes chronic respiratory symptoms such as dyspnea, cough, and expectoration. These symptoms are caused by issues in the airways (bronchitis, bronchiolitis), alveoli (emphysema), and/or pulmonary vessels. COPD is usually a progressive condition and is diagnosed using spirometry and objective evidence of structural or physiological pulmonary dysfunction.

The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study predicted that the prevalence of COPD would increase in the future due to continued exposure to COPD-related risk factors and the aging populations worldwide. However, the current burden of COPD is not consistently represented due to differences in survey methods, diagnostic criteria, and analytical approaches used in different studies. Therefore, it is important to obtain the most up-to-date estimation of COPD burden using the latest data available from GBD 2021, which defines COPD in line with the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) classification and gathers information on COPD prevalence, incidence, remission, and severity from various sources such as literature, hospital claims, and global research studies.

It is also important to regularly update the burden of COPD attributable to different risks. COPD can be caused by factors such as tobacco smoking, biomass exposure, occupational exposures, or other causes, and may present with different clinical features and progressions. Different treatment approaches, both pharmacological and non-pharmacological, may be beneficial for these various causes.

In order to provide evidence for future COPD policy development, it is necessary to update the burden estimates and its attributable risk factors, stratified by age and sex. This will help us determine if there has been a decrease in the gender-burden gap and if the ranking of risk factors has changed. Although GBD 2019 previously provided insights into the COPD burden, a comprehensive update is needed to support evidence-based policy decisions.

### Recent advances in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease pathogenesis: from disease mechanisms to precision medicine [^112Uyfwa]. The Journal of Pathology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an often severely disabling chronic lung disease with a high prevalence of over 250 million cases worldwide. It is currently the fourth leading cause of death globally and is predicted to be the third by 2020 1. In the most recent definition of the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD), COPD is defined as 'a common, preventable and treatable disease that is characterized by persistent respiratory systems and airflow limitation that is due to airway and/or alveolar abnormalities usually caused by significant exposure to noxious particles or gases' 2. This exposure can be quite variable, with smoking being the main risk factor in high‐income countries and indoor cooking and occupational exposures representing important risk factors in low‐income countries. The definition and staging by GOLD is rather uniform, as defined by lung function, symptoms and exacerbation history, despite COPD being a heterogeneous disease in its pathological manifestations in patients. It has long been recognized that inflammation is a central hallmark of COPD, playing a role in the pathological changes in all different lung compartments 3. Next to toxic exposures, genetic predisposition is an important risk factor for COPD and COPD represents a complex disease in which genetic abnormalities in combination with the type and duration of exposures determine the clinical phenotype 4. The development of novel 2D and 3D in vitro and ex vivo models, as well as animal models that accurately recapitulate the main features of COPD pathology, has been very important for the study of disease mechanisms in COPD and recent developments in this area have been amply reviewed elsewhere 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

In the present review we focus on recent developments related to the abnormal inflammatory response, ECM and age‐related changes, structural changes in the small airways and the role of sex‐related differences, which are relevant to explain the underlying individual differences in the disease pathology of COPD and are important to improve disease endotyping. Where possible, we will underpin the observed pathogenetic changes by their potential genetic drivers.

Finally, we will discuss the most recent developments of new treatment strategies using biologicals to target specific pathological features or disease endotypes (a specific group of patients who share a distinct pathobiological mechanism) of COPD.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) pathophysiology and pathology — research priorities focus on targeted etiologic and comparative studies. We recommend studies that elucidate pathways driving the chronic inflammatory response and oxidative stress that lead to the abnormalities characteristic of COPD; studies that elucidate the role of genetics, proteases and antiproteases, the lung microbiome, programmed cell death, mucus hypersecretion, and the pulmonary vasculature in the pathogenesis of COPD; studies that compare the pathogenesis, pathology, histology, progression, prognosis, comorbidities, and treatment response of smoking-induced COPD with COPD related to other factors, including biomass fuels or occupational exposures; and studies that determine the influence of race, sex, and socioeconomic status on the natural history and pathobiology of the disease.

### The 2007 GOLD guidelines: a comprehensive care framework [^11179NH3]. Respiratory Care (2009). Low credibility.

Comprehensive management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) includes proper assessment, monitoring of disease, reduction of risk factors, the management of stable COPD, and the prevention and management of exacerbations. The 2007 COPD guidelines from the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease address each of these aspects of COPD management in detail and provide evidence-based recommendations for patients and health-care professionals. Reduction of risk factors emphasizes the importance of smoking cessation and control of environmental indoor and outdoor pollutants. The management of COPD must be individualized. Aerosol administration of bronchodilators is the most effective method of reducing the work of breathing and alleviating dyspnea. Glucocorticosteroid therapy is recommended to reduce the frequency of exacerbations and improve health-related quality of life for patients with stage 3 and 4 COPD. Pulmonary rehabilitation proves effective in relieving symptoms, improving quality of life, and increasing patients' physical and emotional participation in activities of daily life. Oxygen therapy is essential for patients with substantial hypoxia. Patients with COPD and respiratory failure may benefit from noninvasive ventilation. Surgery may play a limited role in the management of selected patients with COPD. Since exacerbations influence lung function and clinical decline in patients with COPD and contribute to the cost of caring for this disease, efforts must be directed at prevention and management of exacerbations. In addition to controlled oxygen therapy, antimicrobials, brief courses of systemic corticosteroids and, on occasion, noninvasive or invasive mechanical ventilation may play a role. The role of respiratory therapists in the prevention, diagnosis, and management of stable COPD and exacerbations is absolutely essential if the goals of the 2007 Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease guidelines are to be attained.

### Genetics and genomics of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^1144Zyg2]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2009). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) fulfills criteria for a complex genetic disease in which environmental factors interact with multiple polymorphic genes to influence susceptibility. Finding the genes that influence susceptibility can be approached in hypothesis testing or unbiased study designs. In candidate gene association studies, genetic variation in, and/or levels of, expression of genes known or suspected to be involved in the pathogenesis of COPD are compared in affected and unaffected individuals. Although this approach is useful it is limited by our present knowledge of disease pathophysiology. Genomewide studies of gene expression and of genetic variation are now possible and are not constrained by our limited knowledge. Although both of these unbiased approaches are in their infancy, they have already provided exciting new avenues for future investigation and potentially now approaches to risk prediction and therapy.

### Support of personalized medicine through risk-stratified treatment recommendations-an environmental scan of clinical practice guidelines [^115zW1UW]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

An important goal of evidence-based health care is to maximize benefits and minimize harms from medical treatments. To achieve an optimal balance, patients' individual profiles and preferences need to be considered. For example, inhaled corticosteroids are used to prevent exacerbations in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but these drugs are associated with an increased risk for pneumonia and fractures. In patients at high risk for exacerbations, the potential benefits (preventing exacerbations) are likely to be larger than harms, while patients at low risk for exacerbations may experience more harms from inhaled corticosteroids than benefits.

Risk-stratified treatment recommendations are potentially useful to support personalized medicine. Personalized medicine aims at optimizing the benefit-harm balance by considering patient profiles (combination of characteristics) and preferences. For the prevention and treatment of chronic disease, most health care decisions are sensitive to patient profiles and preferences. Risk-stratified treatment recommendations suggest different treatment regimens for patients who are at different risks for outcomes. For example, in the Third Report of the National Cholesterol Education Program's Adult Treatment Panel treatment algorithm, the recommendation for primary prevention of coronary heart disease is based on the Framingham Risk Score. According to different risk categories predicted by the Framingham Risk Score, individuals with higher predicted absolute risk (10-year risk > 20%) are recommended for more intensive treatments (such as combined pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments) than those with lower predicted risk (10-year risk < 10%). There is evidence that using risk-stratified treatments is superior to treatments that are not informed by a risk assessment tool.

Risk-stratified treatment recommendations only serve their purpose of supporting personalized medicine if valid methods were used to develop them. Because it is not known what proportion of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) make risk-stratified treatment recommendations and what methods were used to develop them, our aim was to assess the methods CPGs applied in developing risk-stratified treatment recommendations for the prevention or treatment of selected common chronic diseases.

### Clinical history… [^117J2kAK]. AAFP (2008). Low credibility.

Risk Factors Cigarette smoking is the primary risk factor for COPD. More than 80 percent of deaths from the disease are directly attributable to smoking, and persons who smoke are 12 to 13 times more likely to die from COPD than nonsmokers. 6 The absolute risk of COPD among active, continuous smokers is at least 25 percent.
7. However, other risk factors are responsible for an increasing number of COPD cases. 8 These risk factors include advancing age, secondhand smoke exposure, chronic exposure to environmental or occupational pollutants, alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency, a childhood history of recurrent respiratory infections, and a family history of COPD. Pathophysiology The pathophysiology of COPD is related to chronic airway irritation, mucus production, and pulmonary scarring.

Irritation from environmental pollutants or a genetic predisposition leads to airway inflammation, which causes increased mucus production and decreased mucociliary function. This combination of increased mucus and decreased mucociliary clearance leads to the hallmark COPD symptoms of coughing and sputum production. "Smoker's cough, " an early-morning paroxysm of hacking cough to expectorate respiratory secretions, is also characterized by coughing and sputum production. Smoker's cough is often clinically referred to as chronic bronchitis. A large multicenter trial suggests that dyspnea is a better predictor of mortality than spirometry in patients with COPD. Family and occupational histories are also important when screening for COPD. Alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency is a genetic anomaly of chromosome 14 that leads to premature hepatic and pulmonary disease.

Patients with alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency have early-onset COPD because of the increased tissue damage from neutrophil elastase. Alveolar damage leads to the loss of elastic recoil within the pulmonary parenchyma with subsequent airflow obstruction. Significant occupational hazards are associated with COPD in up to 15 percent of cases.
9. Significant occupational hazards are associated with COPD in up to 15 percent of cases. 9 Occupational hazards include exposure to dust, noxious gases, vapors, or fumes. 9 The industries with the highest exposure risk include those that work with rubber, plastics, leather, or textiles. Persons who work with utilities or general building construction are also at higher risk. 9 Laboratory studies have shown that coal, cadmium, and silica can cause alveolar destruction consistent with COPD. 9.
