## Question

Mitral valve stenosis patient caregiver teaching

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about caregiver teaching for a patient with mitral valve stenosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the disease context and staging to anchor what caregivers must monitor. Then, I should verify the core educational domains and align them with guideline-based management. Next, I will integrate a caregiver-centered framework and specify teaching content, reinforcement, and escalation triggers. Finally, I will tailor content to special populations and close with a concise, actionable summary that caregivers can use day-to-day.

> Let me first confirm the disease context and why caregiver education matters. Mitral stenosis, most often rheumatic, progresses slowly but can precipitate heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, and atrial fibrillation; caregivers often observe subtle functional decline and arrhythmia symptoms that patients minimize, so collateral history and activity tracking are essential to clinical decision-making and timing of intervention [^33126510] [^31669ce8] [^8167b531].

> I need to ensure the educational framework is evidence-based. The CARE model (Caregiver-Centered, Active Engagement, Reinforcement, Education) supports structured caregiver interventions with ongoing reinforcement, and systems-of-care documents emphasize education for patients and families to enable informed consent and shared decision-making; this aligns with the principle that caregivers are co-providers of care and should be engaged proactively [^ae344457] [^c68dae9c].

> Next, I should review the core educational domains. Let me think about what caregivers must know to keep the patient safe and to trigger timely care: disease understanding and progression, symptom recognition and activity tracking, medication management including anticoagulation, lifestyle and activity guidance, red flags and emergency response, and care coordination with the Heart Valve Team; these domains map directly to guideline-directed therapy and follow-up strategies for rheumatic mitral stenosis [^7a1a26b0] [^63411f9c].

> I will now examine disease understanding and progression. Caregivers should know that mitral stenosis restricts forward flow, raises left atrial pressure, and can lead to pulmonary edema and right heart strain; progression is typically slow, but symptoms can accelerate with pregnancy, atrial fibrillation, or intercurrent illness, so serial echocardiography guides follow-up intervals and intervention timing [^31669ce8] [^33126510].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about symptoms. I should confirm what caregivers should track and how to quantify activity. Dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, fatigue, palpitations, and chest discomfort are key; caregivers can use a simple 1–10 activity scale and document changes over time, because collateral history often reveals decline that patients underreport, which influences timing of valve intervention [^8167b531].

> Let me verify medication management, especially anticoagulation. In mitral stenosis with atrial fibrillation, prior embolic event, or left atrial thrombus, warfarin is indicated; DOACs are not appropriate in moderate to severe rheumatic mitral stenosis, so caregivers must understand INR monitoring, dietary consistency, and drug interactions, and they should be prepared to assist with frequent INR checks during initiation and monthly once stable [^ba90db02] [^1140f48] [^6682e067].

> I should double-check heart rate control and symptom relief. Beta-blockers are reasonable for rate control in AF or symptomatic sinus tachycardia, and diuretics can help with volume overload; caregivers should monitor for hypotension, bradycardia, electrolyte changes, and adherence, and they should coordinate dose changes with the clinical team [^ba90db02].

> Next, I should review lifestyle and activity guidance. Sodium restriction to about 2 grams per day helps limit fluid retention; caregivers can plan low-sodium meals and track daily weights. Activity should be individualized, with pacing and rest breaks, and caregivers should watch for escalating dyspnea, orthopnea, or chest discomfort that signals deterioration [^notfound].

> I need to ensure caregivers know red flags and when to escalate. New or worsening dyspnea, rapid weight gain, edema, palpitations or irregular pulse, chest pain, syncope, or hemoptysis warrant urgent evaluation; in pregnancy, severe MS can decompensate in the third trimester or peripartum, so early contact with cardiology and maternal-fetal medicine is critical [^ec1d8bdf].

> Let me consider care coordination and the Heart Valve Team. Severe valvular disease is best managed at a Valve Center with a multidisciplinary team; caregivers should help schedule follow-up, obtain records, and participate in shared decision-making discussions about percutaneous mitral balloon commissurotomy versus surgery, especially when symptoms progress or pulmonary pressures rise [^2c3b7efe] [^63411f9c].

> But wait, what if the patient is pregnant or contemplating pregnancy. I should confirm preconception counseling and pregnancy-specific risks. Women with severe rheumatic MS should have pre-pregnancy TTE and counseling; if symptomatic or with high pulmonary pressures, percutaneous mitral balloon commissurotomy before pregnancy is reasonable; during pregnancy, beta-blockers and cautious diuretics are used, and intervention is considered if refractory symptoms occur, ideally after 20 weeks at experienced centers [^eb4e0bdb] [^276007b4] [^2ed6c357].

> I should also address prosthetic valves and anticoagulation in pregnancy. Mechanical valves require therapeutic anticoagulation with frequent INR monitoring, which is challenging in pregnancy; bioprosthetic valves are preferred in women of childbearing age, and caregivers must support adherence and monitoring plans if a mechanical valve is unavoidable [^f24329bb] [^e0560ea8].

> Next, I should review reinforcement strategies. Knowledge attrition is common, so booster sessions, teach-back, and multimedia resources improve retention; caregivers benefit from peer support and practical tools like medication organizers, weight logs, and symptom diaries, and the clinical team should proactively reassess caregiver burden and adapt support over time [^ed1a768e] [^ae344457].

> Hold on, I should verify that my teaching points are aligned with guideline strength. Anticoagulation with VKA in MS with AF or prior embolism is Class I, heart rate control is Class 2a, and exercise testing or invasive hemodynamics when symptoms and resting echo disagree is Class I; these anchor the caregiver education content and escalation triggers [^ba90db02] [^f33f32b4] [^2b103c0a].

> Finally, let me synthesize a concise, actionable caregiver summary. Caregivers should monitor for worsening exertional dyspnea, orthopnea, fatigue, palpitations, and chest discomfort; track daily weights and a 1–10 activity score; ensure strict adherence to warfarin with consistent diet and INR monitoring; manage sodium intake and fluid balance; recognize red flags that require urgent care; and coordinate follow-up with a Heart Valve Team, with special vigilance in pregnancy or when symptoms and echo findings diverge [^8167b531] [^ba90db02] [^2c3b7efe] [^f33f32b4].

Caregivers of patients with mitral valve stenosis should be taught to **recognize worsening symptoms** (dyspnea, fatigue, palpitations, edema, chest pain) and to **monitor daily weights** for sudden gains (> 2 lbs in 24 hours) that may signal fluid overload [^notfound]. They should ensure **strict medication adherence**, especially warfarin for atrial fibrillation or mechanical valves, with regular INR checks and awareness of drug–food interactions [^ba90db02] [^1140f48]. Caregivers must also know when to seek urgent care — new chest pain, severe dyspnea, confusion, or signs of stroke — and understand activity limits, infection prevention (including antibiotic prophylaxis), and the need for regular cardiology follow-up with echocardiography to track disease progression [^63411f9c] [^31669ce8].

---

## Disease understanding and progression

- **Pathophysiology**: Mitral stenosis narrows the valve, causing left atrial pressure to rise, pulmonary congestion, and right heart strain, leading to dyspnea, fatigue, and edema [^notfound].

- **Progression**: Disease advances slowly; monitor for worsening symptoms and rising pulmonary pressures even if valve area is unchanged [^31669ce8].

- **Complications**: Atrial fibrillation, pulmonary hypertension, heart failure, and stroke are key risks, especially with untreated AF or LA thrombus [^notfound].

---

## Symptom recognition and monitoring

Caregivers should **track symptoms** — dyspnea, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, fatigue, palpitations, chest pain, and edema — and escalate if they worsen [^notfound]. Daily weight checks with a **goal of < 2 lb gain in 24 hours** help detect early fluid overload. Activity should be paced with rest breaks; caregivers should watch for excessive fatigue or dyspnea with minimal exertion.

---

## Medication management

- **Anticoagulation**: Warfarin is indicated for AF, prior embolism, or LA thrombus; teach INR monitoring, dietary consistency, and drug interaction avoidance [^ba90db02] [^1140f48].

- **Heart rate control**: Beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers may be used for AF or sinus tachycardia; monitor for bradycardia and fatigue [^ba90db02].

- **Diuretics**: Use as prescribed for edema or dyspnea; watch for electrolyte imbalance and dehydration [^b36b65f6].

---

## Activity and lifestyle modifications

Activity should be **individualized** with pacing and rest breaks; caregivers should stop activity if the patient becomes dizzy or short of breath. Sodium intake should be limited to about 2 g/day, with attention to hidden sodium sources. Infections should be prevented by practicing hand hygiene and using antibiotic prophylaxis for dental or invasive procedures when indicated.

---

## Red flag symptoms and emergency situations

Seek **urgent care** for new chest pain or pressure, severe dyspnea or orthopnea, confusion or syncope, or signs of stroke (weakness, speech difficulty, facial droop). Call the cardiology team for rapid weight gain (> 2 lbs in 24 hours), new or worsening edema, palpitations or irregular pulse, or persistent cough with pink frothy sputum.

---

## Follow-up care and communication

Ensure **regular cardiology visits** with periodic echocardiography to assess valve area, gradients, and ventricular function [^31669ce8]. Maintain an up-to-date medication list and share changes with all clinicians. Use shared decision-making for interventions, including percutaneous mitral balloon commissurotomy or surgery when indicated [^63411f9c] [^2c3b7efe].

---

## Special considerations

In **pregnancy**, preconception counseling and TTE are essential; bioprosthetic valves are preferred, and PMBC may be considered if severe MS is symptomatic [^eb4e0bdb] [^276007b4]. For **prosthetic valves**, monitor for dysfunction with TTE/TEE and recognize signs of thrombosis or pannus [^8ea62253].

---

## Educational resources and support

Provide **written materials** on disease, medications, and symptom tracking, and consider connecting caregivers with support groups or counseling to reduce burden and improve coping [^723c9b73].

---

Caregiver education should be **practical, reinforced, and tailored** to the patient's disease stage and comorbidities, with clear return precautions and a 24-hour contact for emergencies.

Reinforcement

Most studies in this review, apart from a select few, provided ongoing training, follow‐up, or booster sessions to reinforce and build on skills or knowledge gained. Because of knowledge attrition and ongoing needs, follow‐up and reinforcement is likely important for improved outcomes. What is less clear in the literature is intervals at which reinforcement is required, and frequency, though it will likely be driven by the unique needs of the caregiver and patient.

### Educational needs and application of guidelines in the management of patients with mitral regurgitation. A European mixed-methods study [^c91680a0]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Aims

To assess the knowledge and application of European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Guidelines in the management of mitral regurgitation (MR).

Methods and Results

A mixed-methods educational needs assessment was performed. Following a qualitative phase (interviews), an online survey was undertaken using three case scenarios (asymptomatic severe primary MR, symptomatic severe primary MR in the elderly, and severe secondary MR) in 115 primary care physicians (PCPs), and 439 cardiologists or cardiac surgeons from seven European countries. Systematic cardiac auscultation was performed by only 54% of clinicians in asymptomatic patients. Cardiologists appropriately interpreted echocardiographic assessment of mechanism and quantification of primary MR (≥ 75%), but only 44% recognized secondary MR as severe. In asymptomatic severe primary MR with an indication for surgery, 27% of PCPs did not refer the patient to a cardiologist and medical therapy was overused by 19% of cardiologists. In the elderly patient with severe symptomatic primary MR, 72% of cardiologists considered mitral intervention (transcatheter edge-to-edge valve repair in 72%). In severe symptomatic secondary MR, optimization of medical therapy was advised by only 51% of PCPs and 33% of cardiologists, and surgery considered in 30% of cases (transcatheter edge-to-edge repair in 64%).

Conclusion

Systematic auscultation is underused by PCPs for the early detection of MR. Medical therapy is overused in primary MR and underused in secondary MR. Indications for interventions are appropriate in most patients with primary MR, but are unexpectedly frequent for secondary MR. These gaps identify important targets for future educational programs.

### Valvular heart disease: classic teaching and emerging paradigms [^046a436f]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Valvular heart disease is both prevalent and increases with age. The final pathway of valvular disease is heart failure and sometimes sudden death, so clinicians must identify and treat it before these endpoints occur. Noninvasive diagnostic modalities such as echocardiography, exercise tolerance testing, and cardiac magnetic resonance provide additional quantitative, qualitative, and prognostic data. Studies have elucidated predictors of disease progression and potential medical therapies, but the niche of valvular disease has benefited relatively less from randomized controlled clinical trials than other cardiovascular disease fields. New invasive techniques like transcatheter valve replacement offer hope for high-risk operative candidates. We review classic teaching with current guidelines and emphasize recent advances in disease management.

### Practice gaps in the care of mitral valve regurgitation: insights from the American college of cardiology mitral regurgitation gap analysis and advisory panel [^15dc4915]. American Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The revised 2014 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association valvular heart disease guidelines provide evidenced-based recommendations for the management of mitral regurgitation (MR). However, knowledge gaps related to our evolving understanding of critical MR concepts may impede their implementation.

Methods

The ACC conducted a multifaceted needs assessment to characterize gaps, practice patterns, and perceptions related to the diagnosis and treatment of MR. A key project element was a set of surveys distributed to primary care and cardiovascular physicians (cardiologists and cardiothoracic surgeons). Survey and other gap analysis findings were presented to a panel of 10 expert advisors from specialties of general cardiology, cardiac imaging, interventional cardiology, and cardiac surgeons with expertise in valvular heart disease, especially MR, and cardiovascular education. The panel was charged with assessing the relative importance and potential means of remedying identified gaps to improve care for patients with MR.

Results

The survey results identified several knowledge and practice gaps that may limit implementation of evidence-based recommendations for MR care. Specifically, half of primary care physicians reported uncertainty regarding timing of intervention for patients with severe primary or functional MR. Physicians in all groups reported that quantitative indices of MR severity were frequently not reported in clinical echocardiographic interpretations, and that these measurements were not consistently reviewed when provided in reports. In the treatment of MR, nearly 30% of primary care physician and general cardiologists did not know the volume of mitral valve repair surgeries by their reference cardiac surgeons and did not have a standard source to obtain this information. After review of the survey results, the expert panel summarized practice gaps into 4 thematic areas and offered proposals to address deficiencies and promote better alignment with the 2014 ACC/American Heart Association valvular disease guidelines.

Conclusion

Important knowledge and skill gaps exist that may impede optimal care of the patient with MR. Focused educational and practice interventions should be developed to reduce these gaps.

### Misconceptions and facts about mitral regurgitation [^90b74add]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Mitral regurgitation is a common heart valve disease. It is defined to be primary when it results from the pathology of the mitral valve apparatus itself and secondary when it is caused by distortion of the architecture or function of the left ventricle. Although the diagnosis and management of mitral regurgitation rely heavily on echocardiography, one should bear in mind the caveats and shortcomings of such an approach. Clinical decision making commonly focuses on the indications for surgery, but it is complex and mandates precise assessment of the mitral pathology, symptom status of the patient, and ventricular performance (right and left) among other descriptors. It is important for healthcare providers at all levels to be familiar with the clinical picture, diagnosis, disease course, and management of mitral regurgitation.

Mitral regurgitation (MR) is a complex valve lesion that can pose significant management challenges for the cardiovascular clinician. This Expert Consensus Document emphasizes that recognition of MR should prompt an assessment of its etiology, mechanism, and severity, as well as indications for treatment. A structured approach to evaluation based on clinical findings, precise echocardiographic imaging, and when necessary, adjunctive testing, can help clarify decision making. Treatment goals include timely intervention by an experienced heart team to prevent left ventricular dysfunction, heart failure, reduced quality of life, and premature death.

### 2018 AHA / ACC guideline for the management of adults with congenital heart disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^a741f0f5]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Congenital mitral stenosis — evaluation and management considerations include that "Adults with congenital mitral stenosis or a parachute mitral valve should be evaluated for other left-sided obstructive lesions." Interventional options are limited, as "Balloon mitral valvuloplasty is rarely, if ever, indicated or effective in congenital mitral stenosis." Parachute mitral valve commonly coexists with other defects — "Parachute mitral valve is most commonly found in the presence of other congenital abnormalities such as the components of Shone complex" — and care needs ongoing specialty oversight because "Therefore, these patients require follow-up at a center where such abnormalities can be followed and future interventions considered."

### Mitral regurgitation… [^470f54a3]. AAFP (2001). Low credibility.

Family physicians routinely encounter patients with valvular heart disease. Although major advances in our understanding of this disease have been made in the past two decades, only recently has there been evidence-based literature from which to draw conclusions about its diagnosis and management. The American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association Task Force recently published comprehensive practice guidelines to help clinicians manage this challenging disorder. 1, 2 Improved surgical techniques, noninvasive techniques for surveillance of left ventricular function and guidelines for the timing of surgery have likely combined to contribute to improved survival and decreased morbidity in patients with chronic valvular heart disease. 1, 3. 1 There is presently no medical therapy for aortic stenosis. Aortic valve replacement is the only effective treatment that will relieve this mechanical obstruction.

3 The decision for surgery is based on the presence of at least moderately severe aortic stenosis with symptoms or signs of left ventricular dysfunction. The prognosis with surgery is excellent, even for elderly patients. In fact, the age-adjusted survival rate in postoperative patients is similar to that of the general population. 3 Cardiac catheterization with angiography is warranted in the appropriate age and risk groups before aortic valve replacement is undertaken.

1. The timing of surgery correlates with the clinical outcome. If symptoms are more than mild or if there is evidence of pulmonary hypertension, mechanical intervention is warranted and delaying intervention worsens prognosis. 3 Unlike valvotomy for aortic stenosis, balloon valvotomy for mitral stenosis provides excellent mechanical relief with long-term benefit.

3 Mitral balloon valvotomy is recommended for patients who have New York Heart Association class II, III or IV, moderate or severe mitral stenosis and favorable valve morphology. The valves must be pliable, noncalcified and free of subvalvular distortion. 1, 3 Candidates for valvotomy must have no significant mitral regurgitation.

1. MANAGEMENT Reassurance is a major component of the management of patients with mitral valve prolapse. Patients should be reminded of the low incidence of serious complications associated with mitral valve prolapse, and physicians should attempt to allay fears of serious underlying heart disease. Patients with mitral valve prolapse and symptoms such as chest pain, palpitations or anxiety often respond to treatment with beta-blocking medications. In many cases, cessation of alcohol, tobacco and caffeine use may be sufficient to control symptoms.

Mitral regurgitation (MR) is a complex valve lesion that can pose significant management challenges. This expert consensus decision pathway emphasizes that recognition of MR should prompt an assessment of its etiology, mechanism, and severity, as well as consideration of the indications for treatment. The document is a focused update of the 2017 ACC Expert Consensus Decision Pathway on the Management of Mitral Regurgitation, with some sections updated and others added in light of the publication of new trial data related to secondary MR, among other developments. A structured approach to evaluation based on clinical findings, accurate echocardiographic imaging, and, when necessary, adjunctive testing can help clarify decision making. Treatment goals include timely intervention by an experienced multidisciplinary heart team to prevent left ventricular dysfunction, heart failure, reduced quality of life, and premature death.

### Priorities for patient-centered research in valvular heart disease: a report from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute working group [^d9382971]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

An additional step in the decision process is to determine the best approach to treating the valve. The best approach might depend on technical feasibility (eg, is the left ventricular outflow tract too large or small, are the mitral [or tricuspid] leaflets amenable to clipping, how much mitral annular calcification is too much) but also consider other issues. The choice of a transcatheter versus surgical versus hybrid approach, optimal choice of valve, simultaneous versus sequential procedures for multiple valve disorders, and whether concurrent cardiac conditions (eg, coronary disease) need to be addressed depend on the patients' medical condition, procedural risk, age, and cardiac function, as well as patient preferences and values.

To improve decision making from the clinician perspective, the emphasis should be on identifying factors and developing and validating risk models that will inform, influence, and guide clinical decisions and actions regarding: (1) timing of a procedure (perform it now versus later); (2) whether to recommend a procedure when futility is anticipated (either because of frailty and impaired physical function or a predicted lack of clinical response to the intervention); or (3) whether a specific adjunctive intervention should be employed in a subgroup of patients alongside a procedure to optimize outcomes. For example, a risk prediction tool for poor outcome after TAVR identified 8.4% of patients with a ≥ 70% predicted risk of a poor 1‐year outcome; of those very high‐risk patients, 60.3% were dead and an additional 16.9% had poor quality of life or quality of life decline by 1 year after TAVR. 48 Given that average 1‐year mortality in patients with symptomatic severe AS not getting TAVR is ≈50%, knowing that a patient is in this very high‐risk subgroup may inform shared decision‐making conversations regarding whether to perform TAVR. 49 Similarly, a risk score for outcomes after TAVR that includes a frailty component is useful not so much because it improves discrimination of mortality (eg, improved c‐statistic), but because it identifies patients at very high risk for death or disability at 1 year for whom TAVR may be futile and also identifies patients for whom an aggressive rehabilitation plan is particularly important as an adjunct to TAVR for outcomes to be optimized. 50

### Dismal outcomes and high societal burden of mitral valve regurgitation in France in the recent era: a nationwide perspective [^fef9e0ca]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Despite this dismal prognosis, the vast majority of patients were not treated with the only available curative option for MR, a valve intervention, particularly for PMR. Optimal management of patients with MR requires accurate screening for the disease, appropriate follow‐up and timely intervention, and individualized therapeutic decision‐making. Several recent studies have shown low awareness of VHD among both the general population and the medical community. Auscultation is rarely performed during routine visits to family practitioners, precluding screening and identification of patients with VHD. 27 However, in the present study, MR was clearly identified and coded in the discharge summary. Nevertheless, < 10% of patients admitted with significant MR underwent a valve intervention within 1 year, leaving the vast majority of the population untreated. The rate of intervention was remarkably low for both PMR and SMR. These low rates of interventions are even more striking considering that all individuals were inpatients, admitted to French hospitals with relatively easy access to cardiologists. Although we acknowledge that the appropriateness of management cannot be inferred from the current database, the low rate of intervention suggests undertreatment of patients with MR, especially those who presented with HF. Such undertreatment has also been described at the community level. 12 Among Olmsted County (MN, USA) residents, < 15% of patients with MR and a class I or IIa indication for intervention were referred for a valve intervention despite the identification of disease on echocardiography and easy access to a high‐quality medical center offering all types of mitral valve interventions. Our population‐wide data show coherently in Europe and the United States that the vast majority of patients with MR are conservatively managed. The gap between the recommendations of scientific societies and real‐life practice may be related to insufficient knowledge of VHD evaluation and management or poor compliance with guidelines by medical caregivers, 28, 29 as shown in a recent survey highlighting an important and substantial opportunity to improve outcomes of patients with MR. 30

Education — Members of the Comprehensive (Level I) and Primary (Level II) Valve Centers should provide ongoing education to clinicians at local, national, and international conferences, and centers should continue to educate their own MDT members and other professionals with particular emphasis on the valve program coordinator, advanced practice providers, and nurses. Comprehensive (Level I) Valve Centers should interface with Primary (Level II) Valve Centers to discuss best practices, provide feedback on cases, and establish a shared understanding of when patients with VHD will require referral for more complex care, as well as on-site coaching of the interventional team for technical skills. It is also important to educate patients and families to improve understanding, enable informed consent, and emphasize SDM, and further development and validation of SDM tools for patients with VHD is needed. Finally, education of the public about VHD may help improve early detection and optimize the timing of referral.

Preconception management of women with native valve disease — algorithm: All women with suspected valve disease who are considering pregnancy should undergo a clinical evaluation and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) before pregnancy (1), and if severe disease is present, pre-pregnancy counseling by a cardiologist with expertise in managing women with valvular heart disease (VHD) during pregnancy (1). Exercise testing is reasonable before pregnancy (2a). For lesion-specific branches: Severe rheumatic mitral stenosis amenable to balloon commissurotomy? → Balloon commissurotomy before pregnancy (2a). Severe aortic stenosis? → Valve intervention before pregnancy is reasonable (2a). Severe mitral regurgitation and valve suitable for repair? → Valve repair may be considered after detailed discussion with patient (2b).

Valvular heart disease — top take-home messages (items 1–5) state that disease stages in patients with valvular heart disease "should be classified (Stages A, B, C, and D) on the basis of symptoms, valve anatomy, the severity of valve dysfunction, and the response of the ventricle and pulmonary circulation." In evaluation, history and physical examination findings "should be correlated with the results of noninvasive testing (ie, ECG, chest x-ray, transthoracic echocardiogram)," and if discordance exists, clinicians should "consider further noninvasive (computed tomography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, stress testing) or invasive (transesophageal echocardiography, cardiac catheterization) testing to determine optimal treatment strategy." For patients with valvular heart disease and atrial fibrillation (except those with rheumatic mitral stenosis or a mechanical prosthesis), the anticoagulation decision "with either a vitamin K antagonist or a non–vitamin K antagonist anticoagulant, should be made in a shared decision-making process based on the CHA2DS2-VASc score," and those with rheumatic mitral stenosis or a mechanical prosthesis and atrial fibrillation "should receive oral anticoagulation with a vitamin K antagonist."

Timing of the procedure is also an important step in decision making: Does the patient meet criteria for treatment of the valve? Our current indications for treatment with transcatheter therapies reflect practice patterns when surgery is the only option. With less invasive treatments and increasing options for repeat procedures, the optimal timing of intervention should be questioned. With the introduction of TAVR and the opportunity for valve‐in‐valve TAVR in the treatment of AS, strategy trials are important to better understand whether TAVR may be beneficial earlier in the disease, ie, before symptoms (eg, EARLY TAVR [Evaluation of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Compared to Surveillance for Patients With Asymptomatic Severe Aortic Stenosis] NCT 03042104], or in symptomatic moderate disease (eg, TAVR UNLOAD [Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement to Unload the Left Ventricle in Patients With Advanced Heart Failure: A Randomized Trial] NCT 02661451). Similar questions about timing exist for the treatment of mitral and tricuspid valve disease. The technology, however, is at an earlier stage in defining the efficacy of approaches and devices.

Congenital mitral stenosis — recommendation and lesion complexity indicate that adults with congenital mitral stenosis or a parachute mitral valve should be evaluated for other left-sided obstructive lesions. Congenital mitral valve disease may be anatomically complex and is often accompanied by other lesions, and balloon mitral valvuloplasty is rarely, if ever, indicated or effective in congenital mitral stenosis. Parachute mitral valve is most commonly found in the presence of other congenital abnormalities such as the components of Shone complex; recurrence and progression of the various associated lesions are expected, subsequent surgeries are common, and mortality may be associated with other defects; therefore, these patients require follow-up at a center where such abnormalities can be followed and future interventions considered, with choices and techniques for valve repair or replacement based on consideration of coexisting abnormalities including the likelihood of future surgery.

### Transcatheter treatment of valvular heart disease: a review [^e0d2fca4]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

More than 40 million people are living with either mitral or aortic valve disease worldwide, and more than 180 000 heart valve replacement surgeries are performed each year in the US. Transcatheter valve repair has emerged as an important therapeutic option for patients who are candidates for heart valve replacement.

Observations

All transcatheter valve therapies involve a multidisciplinary team of interventional cardiologists, cardiothoracic surgeons, radiologists, echocardiographers, nurses, and social workers, termed the heart team, to determine the optimal approach for managing each patient. Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is an aortic valve replacement procedure that is performed percutaneously and is currently approved for patients with severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis in all surgical risk categories. The TAVI procedure can be performed using a balloon-expandable or self-expanding valve. In a low-risk cohort of patients (PARTNER [Placement of Aortic Transcatheter Valves] 3 trial), the rates of death from any cause, stroke, or rehospitalization were 8.5% for patients receiving TAVI and 15.1% for patients undergoing surgical aortic valve replacement. Decision-making regarding therapy choice should be based on individual anatomy (including the number of leaflets, annular size, and peripheral arterial anatomy), comorbidities (including concomitant coronary artery disease and aortopathies), and patient preference guide. A mitral transcatheter edge-to-edge repair device is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for high-risk patients with degenerative and functional mitral regurgitation that has excellent safety and efficacy in these populations. In the COAPT (Cardiovascular Outcomes Assessment of the MitraClip Percutaneous Therapy for Heart Failure Patients with Functional Mitral Regurgitation) trial, the annualized rate of all hospitalizations for heart failure was 35.8% among patients who underwent transcatheter edge-to-edge repair and received medical therapy compared with 67.9% among patients in the medical therapy alone group. Transcatheter tricuspid valve repair and replacement trials are ongoing and show promise for the treatment of patients with tricuspid regurgitation, which previously had limited therapeutic options. Multimodality imaging, which includes transthoracic echocardiography, transesophageal echocardiography, computed tomography, and intracardiac echocardiography, is important for preprocedural planning, device selection, and optimal outcomes.

Conclusions and Relevance

Approximately 78 000 TAVI procedures and 10 000 transcatheter mitral valve repairs take place yearly in the US to treat patients with severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation, respectively. Transcatheter valve therapies have expanded therapeutic options for patients, including for those who previously had no viable surgical options.

PERSPECTIVES

COMPETENCY IN PATIENT CARE AND PROCEDURAL SKILLS: In patients with severe sMR and HF, a heterogenous risk spectrum was identified by supervised learning techniques. Patients with younger age, better renal function, and higher hemoglobin values had the most favorable survival, whereas older patients with low serum albumin and higher NT-proBNP values experience a 20-fold risk increase in mortality.

TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: Further studies are needed to refine the therapeutic management for sMR in every HF subtype, taking into account the complex underlying heterogeneity in this population.

### Patient-reported goals in tricuspid regurgitation: a qualitative analysis of patient and care partner perspectives [^342f6116]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is a common valvular heart condition that is often a result of concurrent heart disease such as left-sided heart failure or atrial fibrillation leading to atrial enlargement. When symptomatic, the natural history of TR includes earlier mortality and significant detriments in quality of life. Optimization of a patient's health status (ie, symptoms, functional status, and quality of life) is a central goal in the treatment of heart disease and plays a pivotal role in the determination of efficacy of therapeutic approaches in multiple heart failure trials. More recently, patient-reported outcomes (PROs) have been incorporated into the assessment of transcatheter devices to treat valvular heart disease, particularly those to treat TR.

Until recently, treatment options for severe symptomatic TR were limited to diuretic therapy to manage the common physical signs of right-sided congestion, most commonly lower leg swelling. The more insidious symptoms of fatigue and overall debility due to low energy are often attributed to aging or inactivity rather than severe TR, complicating diagnosis. In the context of previously limited treatment options, patients were less likely to be appropriately diagnosed or educated about the disease or its natural history by their clinicians as there was little research supporting new developments.

Surgical therapy for severe TR is offered rarely and typically only in the context of concomitant procedures (ie, mitral valve repair), albeit with some risk. Isolated tricuspid valve (TV) surgery is associated with high in-hospital mortality among older patients presenting with heart failure symptoms, in part, because of the late presentation and multiple comorbidities of this population.

With the development of novel transcatheter repair and replacement devices, the literature on diagnosis and treatment of TR has skyrocketed. No longer forgotten, research on the TV is flourishing, including topics such as disease prevalence and natural history, intersections with heart failure, role of atrial fibrillation, concomitant valvular heart disease, mortality risk scores for surgery and transcatheter device therapies, and PROs. However, data on the patient experience are lacking.

Parallel to the current and numerous developing therapeutic options, the variety of patient characteristics and MR mechanisms result in a complex decision tree directing patient evaluation as well as timing and appropriateness of therapy. As such, current guidelines recommend that patients being considered for surgical or transcatheter therapies undergo consultation with a multidisciplinary heart team within a heart valve center of excellence. 2 This includes focused evaluations by physicians and advanced practitioners with expertise in heart failure, echocardiography, interventional cardiology, and cardiac surgery. Care by heart failure specialists promotes achievement of optimized guideline‐directed medical therapy in secondary MR patients, such that MR severity improves in many cases. Likewise, use of beta blockers, angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors, and aldosterone antagonists can be maximized in primary MR patients who have developed LV dysfunction. Similarly, simultaneous patient assessment by cardiac surgeons and cardiologists with expertise in echocardiography and interventional therapies facilitates evaluation for candidacy of surgical or transcatheter therapies. Evaluation by multiple clinicians in the same setting enables real‐time discussion and planning with the patient and enhances communication with referring providers.

you again for your work, and thank you to the public for participating in today's meeting in person, via live stream, and by teleconference. So let's go ahead and get started. The first proposal we will discuss today was submitted by the American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine, AAHPM, and is entitled "Patient and Caregiver Support for Serious. services. Participating beneficiaries must meet detailed diagnostic and functional status and utilization criteria in two clinical complexity tiers. Payments, there are two tier-based monthly care management payments and two. 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 delivered by the palliative care team, it must include the team — a physician, a nurse, social worker, and spiritual care provider. There are other members who may be part of. the team. And just to highlight on the certification, one core interdisciplinary team member must be certified, but it's, to clarify, not required to be the physician or the nurse practitioner.

Any of the team members can be certified. In terms of payments, the palliative care team. highlight a couple of things. Tier 1, the base payment is $400 per beneficiary per month; Tier 2, $650. And, again, there are other adjustments as previously described in the slides. The per beneficiary per month payment replaces E&M payments. However, providers that are not part of the PCT continue to receive E&M and other payments, but cannot bill for CCM, chronic care management, or complex CCM codes. Again, PRT noted that the model's goals are — in terms of the performance measures — are generally weak. However, as we discussed some of the issues around potential enrollment bias, lack of confidence intervals, which I've already discussed, we really grappled with how — with how well it can be evaluated, but ultimately concluded that it met this criterion minimally.

For integration and care coordination, PRT conclusion was the proposal meets the criterion, and again, use of interdisciplinary palliative care teams will likely encourage greater integration and care coordination among. between Tier 1 and Tier 2, the absence of confidence intervals around benchmarks, absenc.

### Priorities for patient-centered research in valvular heart disease: a report from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute working group [^b02e0c8e]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Specialized comprehensive valve centers are recommended in guidelines for patients with asymptomatic severe VHD, patients who may benefit from repair versus replacement, and patients with multimorbid disease. 1, 16 This recommendation is based on a known surgical volumes‐outcomes relationship as well as high rates of mitral repair for mitral valve prolapse at some centers. 17, 18 In addition, more recent data suggest that mortality following transfemoral TAVR is higher and more variable at lower‐volume centers. 19 Lower‐volume centers treat greater proportions of rural patients, black patients, and Hispanic patients. 19

The implications of concentrating VHD care at high‐volume comprehensive valve centers are unclear. For coronary artery disease, centers of excellence do not appear to have better outcomes. 20 Adding nuance, the focus of high‐volume comprehensive valve centers is on the procedural aspect of care for patients with VHD. However, there may be value to patients with VHD being followed in more specialized heart valve clinics during the progressive stage of disease and after a valve procedure. 21, 22, 23 How this specialized longitudinal care would be integrated into a system of care that might concentrate expertise and procedures in certain centers (that may be less practical to access for patients longitudinally) is unclear. Optimizing and integrating care for patients with VHD along the continuum of disease before and potentially after an intervention is fraught with challenges and uncertainties, particularly in a healthcare environment of increasingly restricted lines of referral mandated by insurance providers or other forces. 16 The cost implications of various models are also uncertain but inevitably intersect with considerations of quality and access to care. These issues are clearly not unique to patients with VHD, but there are some particular ways in which these system‐of‐care issues may specifically affect them. Diverse stakeholders need to engage Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and other policy makers to ensure that policies are developed that are evidence based and in the best interests of our patients.

Rheumatic mitral stenosis (MS) — medical therapy includes that in patients with MS and atrial fibrillation (AF), a prior embolic event, or an LA thrombus, anticoagulation with a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) is indicated (COR 1; LOE C-LD). In MS with AF and a rapid ventricular response, heart rate control can be beneficial (COR 2a; LOE C-LD). In MS in normal sinus rhythm with symptomatic resting or exertional sinus tachycardia, heart rate control can be beneficial to manage symptoms (COR 2a; LOE A).

1954. 00250050032005. IT IS NOT the province of this paper to discuss in detail the diagnosis of mitral valve disease or to delineate our criteria for selection of patients for operation. We have considered the latter problem at a previous meeting of this Association. 1 However, a few statements in this regard may be useful. At the State University of Iowa Hospitals internists, radiologists, clinical physiologists, and surgeons work as a team in the selection of patients for mitral valvuloplasty and in their management. To date 95 cardiotomies have been performed on patients ranging from 11 to 60 years of age, with an operative mortality rate of only 4. 3%.

We do not recommend operation on patients in whom mitral stenosis exists but in whom there are no clinical symptoms referable to this lesion.

### Clinicians for CARE: a systematic review and meta-analysis of interventions to support caregivers of patients with heart disease [^ae344457]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Figure 5
Building dialogue with caregivers.

We use the Caregiver‐Centered, Active Engagement, Reinforcement, Education (CARE) model to develop scripts for health care professionals to build dialogue with caregivers. We provide statements that recognize the important role caregivers play, engage the caregiver in conversation, and follow‐up questions to navigate caregiver interactions.

While our review focused on caregivers of patients with heart disease because of its prevalence and lack of representation in the caregiver literature, we believe that the guidelines presented are generalizable to the patient‐caregiver dyad in other chronic diseases. The aspects of the CARE model highlighted by the interventions in this review are also well supported in the existing caregiver literature.

Caregiver‐Centered Approach

Wolff and colleagues, and others have highlighted the spectrum of caregiver needs, arguing for a more tailored approach to care that has the caregiver in focus., At baseline some caregivers are at higher risk of incurring the negative health effects of being a caregiver and require more immediate intervention to prevent harm. Some of these risk factors include poor health, lack of choice in being a caregiver, and low‐wage jobs without flexibility. Several of the studies in the review included caregiver needs assessment in the form of questionnaires or interviews, allowing the interventions to be more aligned with the identified caregiver needs instead of a one size fits all approach.,

Active Engagement

Caregivers support patients in various ways, including assisting with activities of daily living, instrumental activities of daily living, and health care‐related activities such as medication administration, organizing appointments, and providing transportation. Buck and colleagues and others have underscored the importance of caregiver engagement by the medical team as co‐providers of care., Caregivers want to be treated as part of the care team and are often frustrated by their health care teams' lack of acknowledgment and support. As supported by our review, successful interventions used various methods to actively engage caregivers. These included the use of multimedia resources, role play, teach back, peer support groups, small group activities, and workbooks/manuals., Engagement by the health care team should be multidisciplinary, extending to physicians, pharmacists, nurses, dieticians, physical therapists, social workers, and more.

### Society of cardiothoracic surgery in great britain and Ireland guidance for adult mitral valve disease and interventions [^07b670af]. BMJ Surgery, Interventions, & Health Technologies (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Scope and application of guidelines

The clinical management of adult mitral valve disease is an evolving and increasingly complex landscape from both surgical and percutaneous perspectives. With increasing research and technology development, the National Health Service England (NHSE) has identified confusion among healthcare professionals regarding the appropriate implementation of recent technologies in the UK and Ireland. The authors aim to provide an adult mitral valve disease guidance resource for healthcare professionals and teams within cardiothoracic surgery and allied specialties. This resource endeavors to provide current perspectives, practical recommendations, and supplemental information to existing guidance regarding current practice and developing research within mitral disease management. This guideline recognizes the existing evidence base and uncertainties surrounding interventions, which are essential for supporting informed consent and promoting shared decision-making.

Methodology

The NHSE asked the Society of Cardiothoracic Surgery in Great Britain and Ireland (SCTS) to develop a comprehensive guidance document pertaining to mitral valve disease. Consequently, a clinical guidelines team with relevant expertise and experience formulating clinical guidancewas convened, involving stakeholders from multiple UK cardiothoracic centers. The guidelines are developed to be used by doctors and allied health professionals within cardiothoracic surgery and associated specialties. Patient stakeholders were interviewed to identify and consider their priorities, values, and concerns regarding valve disease management. Assessment of stakeholder involvement via the Patient Engagement Evaluation Tool 6demonstrated thorough and high-quality engagement across all domains.

Prior to initiating the literature review, the team meticulously structured the guidelines and formulated pertinent clinical questions regarding current uncertainty and recommendations relevant to clinical practice in the UK and Ireland. Subsequently, an exhaustive literature search was conducted across multiple databases, employing a variety of search terms. The databases used include Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, and Google Scholar. The authors rigorously assessed the quality of evidence acquired, ensuring its thorough consideration when formulating the guidelines. Produced recommendations were reviewed by all authors. All conflicts of evidence interpretation or formulation of recommendations were resolved by discussion within the clinical guidance team.

No funding was provided for the production of the following clinical guidance document.

### Clinicians for CARE: a systematic review and meta-analysis of interventions to support caregivers of patients with heart disease [^723c9b73]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Education

Caregivers often feel ill‐prepared to deliver care, and lack understanding and knowledge about the patient's disease process and their role in supporting patients, which results in increased uncertainty and distress., This highlights the value placed by caregivers in understanding their loved ones disease and how they can effectively support them. In a study of an intervention for caregivers of patients who had a heart attack, caregivers had increased understanding, less anxiety, and more positive expectations when they attended 1 half‐hour patient‐and‐spouse session with a psychologist, focused on illness perception, in addition to standard of care. All interventions in our review offered some form of education covering illness perception, clinical knowledge base, or psychosocial components of care. Topics for education are diverse and should be guided by the disease process and by caregiver and patient needs.

We acknowledge that while these best practices may be identified, the level of support that can be offered to caregivers of patients may be limited, because of time constraints in busy practices and the patient‐centered focus of our reimbursement system. Consequently, initial caregiver interventions should be designed to be cost and resource effective. For example, in their study, Lang and colleagues, discuss the societal, health care utilization, and intervention costs associated with their positive caregiver and patient outcomes. In a recent article, Wolff and colleagues outlined strategies at a clinical and policy level to begin addressing this inequity of care. They argue that the clinical team has a responsibility for identification of at‐risk caregivers, assessment of caregiver burden, and provision of tailored support to caregivers. However, Wolff and colleagues also acknowledged that the clinical team needs to be better educated to engage and support caregivers, and reimbursement strategies must change to hold the entire clinical team accountable in the support of caregivers. As we await continued policy shifts, we propose the CARE model as a way to enable clinicians to identify and engage caregivers most at risk and to provide a framework for continued research. The CARE model provides themes in which clinicians may engage, build dialogue with, and identify needs of caregivers. While it is our hope that this model provides strategies that will reduce caregiver stress and improve their quality of life, we must acknowledge that there are inherent qualities of the caregiver such as age, comorbidities, resilience, and existing social support that are not as easily impacted and can also have an important effect on caregiver outcomes. Consequently, further translational studies are necessary to identify effective interventions for caregivers that are resource‐efficient, and adaptable to the workflow of members of the health care team.

ACC/AHA native valvular heart disease — pre-pregnancy intervention planning: In symptomatic women with severe VHD who are considering pregnancy, intervention before pregnancy is recommended on the basis of standard indications. In women who require a valve intervention before pregnancy, the choice of prosthetic valve should be based on a shared decision-making process that accounts for the patient's values and preferences, including discussion of the risks of mechanical valves during pregnancy and the reduced durability of bioprosthetic valves in young women. In asymptomatic women with severe rheumatic mitral stenosis (MS) (mitral valve area ≤ 1.5 cm2; Stage C1) who are considering pregnancy, percutaneous balloon mitral commissurotomy (PMBC) at a Comprehensive Valve Center is reasonable before pregnancy for those who have favorable valve morphology. In women of childbearing age who require valve replacement, bioprosthetic valves are preferred over mechanical valves because of the increased maternal and fetal risks of mechanical heart valves in pregnancy. In asymptomatic women with severe aortic stenosis (AS) (aortic velocity ≥ 4.0 m/s or mean pressure gradient ≥ 40 mm Hg, Stage C1) who are considering pregnancy, valve intervention before pregnancy is reasonable. In asymptomatic women with severe AS (aortic velocity ≥ 4.0 m/s or mean pressure gradient ≥ 40 mm Hg, Stage C1) who are considering pregnancy, do not meet COR 1 criteria for intervention, and have a preconception evaluation confirming the absence of symptoms (including normal exercise stress testing and serum BNP measurements), medical management during pregnancy may be considered to avoid prosthetic valve replacement. In asymptomatic women with severe mitral regurgitation (MR) (Stage C1) and a valve suitable for repair who are considering pregnancy, valve repair before pregnancy at a Comprehensive Valve Center may be considered but only after detailed discussion with the patient about the risks and benefits of the surgery and its effect on future pregnancies.

Rheumatic mitral stenosis — surgical therapy is characterized by the statement that "Mitral valve surgery is an established therapy for rheumatic MS, with the preferred approach being commissurotomy (either closed, where the valve is opened blindly through the LA or LV, or open, which allows more extensive surgery under direct visualization) when anatomy is favorable." When anatomy is unfavorable, "In the presence of severe valvular thickening and subvalvular fibrosis with leaflet tethering, mitral valve replacement may be the best option." Additional considerations include that "patients with moderate or severe TR may also have a better outcome with a surgical approach that includes tricuspid valve repair," and outcomes may vary by expertise because "Patients undergoing surgical commissurotomy at centers with a high level of expertise may have better long-term outcomes than those undergoing PMBC."

4.2 Heart Team meeting in the era of VBM

In the era of VBM, the Heart Team meeting as we know today will also need an update. Besides EBM, surgical risk scores and anatomical considerations, other factors such as expected resource utilization, patient experience and preference ("shared decision‐making"), social status, anticipated hospitalization length, and need for informal caregiving will have to be considered. For example, for an 80‐year‐old patient with an STS surgical risk score < 3% but living alone, TAVR would probably be the more "value‐based" therapeutic choice. Especially when choosing between equally efficient therapies such as SAVR and TAVR, additional patient‐perceived value data will increasingly influence the therapeutic decision‐making process in the future.

Table 4
Summary of the Management of Valvular Heart Disease in Pregnancy

Patients with pre-existing valvular disease should undergo comprehensive risk assessment prior to conception, including echocardiographic evaluation of valvular severity, ventricular function, and pulmonary pressures. Contraceptive counseling and timing of valve intervention are crucial elements of preconception care. However, in the context of cardiac intensive care unit (CICU)-level management, the focus shifts to acute stabilization and emergent intervention during pregnancy, particularly in patients who present without prior optimization.

Mitral stenosis is the most clinically significant valvular lesion encountered during pregnancy, conferring a high risk of heart failure in those with valve area of < 1.5 cm 2. Patients with severe mitral stenosis are at risk of pulmonary edema, especially in the third trimester and peripartum period. CICU management includes noninvasive ventilation for pulmonary edema, intravenous diuretics for volume control, and beta-1 selective blockers for heart rate control. In cases of hemodynamic compromise, cautious afterload reduction with agents like hydralazine may be necessary. If medical therapy fails, percutaneous balloon mitral valvotomy may be considered, preferably after 20 weeks' gestation, at an experienced center, and with fetal shielding. Delivery planning in severe mitral stenosis should anticipate the risk of decompensation (ie, heart failure symptoms or hemodynamic instability); assisted second-stage vaginal delivery is generally preferred, but cesarean delivery may be warranted in unstable patients.

### Severe heart failure in the setting of relatively mild mitral stenosis: the role of invasive hemodynamic assessment [^398d26bb]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2008). Low credibility.

For patients with heart failure and relatively mild mitral stenosis, an exercise hemodynamic study should be considered. However, exercise intolerance is a common symptom in a variety of cardiac and noncardiac diseases, emphasizing the need for a thorough differential diagnosis in the planning and execution of these studies. This manuscript discusses two cases that illustrate the need for this comprehensive approach, the indications for balloon mitral valvuloplasty, and the recognition of diastolic dysfunction in these patients.

Rheumatic mitral stenosis — intervention recommendations: In symptomatic patients (NYHA class II, III, or IV) with severe rheumatic mitral stenosis (MS) with mitral valve area ≤ 1.5 cm2 and favorable valve morphology with less than moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation (MR) and no left atrial (LA) thrombus, percutaneous mitral balloon commissurotomy (PMBC) is recommended if it can be performed at a Comprehensive Valve Center. In severely symptomatic patients (NYHA class III or IV) with severe rheumatic MS with mitral valve area ≤ 1.5 cm2 who 1) are not candidates for PMBC, 2) have failed a previous PMBC, 3) require other cardiac procedures, or 4) do not have access to PMBC, mitral valve surgery (repair, commissurotomy, or valve replacement) is indicated. In asymptomatic patients with severe rheumatic MS with mitral valve area ≤ 1.5 cm2 and favorable valve morphology with less than 2+ MR and no LA thrombus who have elevated pulmonary pressures (pulmonary artery systolic pressure > 50 mm Hg), PMBC is reasonable if it can be performed at a Comprehensive Valve Center. In asymptomatic patients with severe rheumatic MS with mitral valve area ≤ 1.5 cm2 and favorable valve morphology with less than 2+ MR and no LA thrombus who have new onset of AF, PMBC may be considered if it can be performed at a Comprehensive Valve Center. In symptomatic patients with rheumatic MS and a mitral valve area > 1.5 cm2, if there is evidence of hemodynamically significant rheumatic MS on the basis of a pulmonary artery wedge pressure > 25 mm Hg or a mean mitral valve gradient > 15 mm Hg during exercise, PMBC may be considered if it can be performed at a Comprehensive Valve Center. In severely symptomatic patients with severe rheumatic MS with mitral valve area ≤ 1.5 cm2 and suboptimal valve anatomy who are not candidates for surgery or are at high surgical risk, PMBC may be considered if it can be performed at a Comprehensive Valve Center.
