## Question

Can sevelamer be used to treat hemochromatosis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether sevelamer can be used to treat hemochromatosis (iron overload), and if not, what the evidence-based rationale is for or against its use in this context. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about sevelamer's approved indication and mechanism of action. Then, I should review guideline-endorsed treatments for hereditary hemochromatosis and when alternatives to phlebotomy are appropriate. Next, I will examine whether sevelamer could plausibly influence iron absorption or binding. After that, I need to check for any clinical evidence or guideline mentions supporting sevelamer in hemochromatosis. Then, I should consider safety, pill burden, and off-label implications. Finally, I will synthesize a clear conclusion with practical guidance and references.

> Let me first confirm sevelamer's indication and pharmacology before drawing any conclusions. Sevelamer carbonate is a non-absorbed polymeric phosphate binder approved for controlling hyperphosphatemia in adults with end-stage renal disease; it binds dietary phosphate in the gastrointestinal tract and also has bile acid–binding properties, which explains effects on lipids, but it is not an iron chelator and is not indicated for iron overload disorders [^114Zhjys] [^111P54kU] [^115wuTzf].

> Next, I should review what the hemochromatosis guidelines actually recommend so I don't overextend assumptions. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: hereditary hemochromatosis treatment is centered on iron depletion by therapeutic phlebotomy as first-line therapy, with targets such as achieving ferritin around 50–100 µg/L per AASLD and approximately 20–30 µg/L with transferrin saturation less than 50% per BSH, and EASL reiterates iron depletion therapy as first-line standard of care [^112BCrPS] [^1117Lswq] [^115nKPSB] [^116Hqc7D] [^117GZvjU].

> I should confirm the role of non-phlebotomy options for patients who cannot tolerate venesection. For individuals intolerant, refractory, or in whom phlebotomy may cause harm, guidelines allow iron chelation as a second-line option, though EASL emphasizes that deferasirox is not approved for hemochromatosis and carries gastrointestinal and renal risks; novel strategies like hepcidin mimetics (e.g., rusfertide) are under investigation but are not yet standard of care [^1164bxyb] [^116iMoqs] [^111RotAY].

> Now, does sevelamer have any plausible mechanism to reduce iron absorption or bind iron in the gut? Wait, let me verify this carefully because bile acid binding might sound superficially similar to metal binding. Sevelamer's mechanism is phosphate and bile acid sequestration; it does not bind iron or chelate systemic iron, whereas true iron chelators directly complex free or labile iron to enhance excretion; by contrast, agents like proton pump inhibitors can reduce non-heme iron absorption by raising gastric pH, but that is a different, acid-dependent mechanism unrelated to sevelamer's polymeric binding profile [^115wuTzf] [^114HvGqF] [^116FhZtR].

> I will now examine the evidence base for any off-label use of sevelamer in hemochromatosis. Let me think about this systematically: if sevelamer had any role, I would expect at least a mention in major guidelines or clinical trials. Across AASLD, ACG, and EASL guidance, as well as reviews of sevelamer, there is no mention of sevelamer for hereditary hemochromatosis or iron overload; the literature consistently frames sevelamer exclusively as a phosphate binder for CKD-related hyperphosphatemia, not as an iron-modulating therapy [^116Hqc7D] [^117GZvjU] [^112BCrPS] [^111P54kU].

> But wait, what if the absence of mention is because of hepatic comorbidity concerns rather than efficacy? I should double-check the labeling context. The sevelamer label notes acceptability in chronic liver disease without dose adjustment, which reassures on hepatic safety parameters, but this does not imply efficacy for iron overload; moreover, it adds gastrointestinal adverse effects and pill burden without addressing the core pathophysiology of iron excess, making it an irrational choice for hemochromatosis management [^112TJvjH] [^113ArG4R] [^114LenLk] [^112evhQz].

> Let me synthesize this and ensure I am not missing an edge case. Sevelamer has no iron-binding or iron-depleting properties, guidelines do not endorse it for iron overload, and its use would introduce adverse effects without benefit; therefore, sevelamer should not be used to treat hereditary hemochromatosis. The evidence-based approach remains therapeutic phlebotomy as first-line, reserving iron chelation for patients who cannot undergo phlebotomy, while emerging agents like rusfertide are investigational; sevelamer's role remains limited to phosphate control in CKD, not iron overload disorders [^112BCrPS] [^116Hqc7D] [^1164bxyb] [^111RotAY] [^114Zhjys].

Sevelamer is **not effective for treating hemochromatosis** because it does not bind iron or reduce iron absorption [^111P54kU]. The standard of care is **phlebotomy** [^116Hqc7D] to remove excess iron; iron chelation (deferasirox or deferoxamine) is reserved for patients who cannot tolerate phlebotomy [^1164bxyb]. Sevelamer is a phosphate binder for hyperphosphatemia in CKD [^114Zhjys] and has no role in iron overload management. No clinical evidence or guidelines support sevelamer for hemochromatosis; its use should be avoided [^117GZvjU].

---

## Mechanism of action of sevelamer

Sevelamer is a non-absorbed polymer [^111P54kU] that binds phosphate in the gut, reducing intestinal absorption and lowering serum phosphate in CKD [^114Zhjys]. It **does not bind iron** or affect iron absorption and therefore cannot reduce iron overload in hemochromatosis.

---

## Current standard treatments for hemochromatosis

The primary treatment for hemochromatosis is **therapeutic phlebotomy** [^116Hqc7D], which removes iron directly and normalizes iron stores. Iron chelation (deferasirox or deferoxamine) is reserved for patients who cannot tolerate phlebotomy or have severe anemia or heart failure [^1164bxyb]. These therapies are effective and guideline-supported [^115nKPSB].

---

## Clinical evidence regarding sevelamer in hemochromatosis

There is **no clinical evidence** that sevelamer reduces iron absorption or body iron stores in hemochromatosis. Its mechanism does not allow iron binding, and no studies or trials demonstrate benefit in iron overload.

---

## Safety considerations and potential risks

Sevelamer can cause **gastrointestinal adverse effects** (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain) [^113ArG4R] and may reduce the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins and folic acid [^114LenLk]. Given the lack of benefit, these risks are not justified in hemochromatosis.

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Current guidelines **do not recommend sevelamer** for hemochromatosis [^116Hqc7D]. The recommended approach is **phlebotomy**, with chelation only when phlebotomy is not feasible [^1164bxyb]. Sevelamer is indicated only for hyperphosphatemia in CKD [^114Zhjys].

---

## Alternative treatments and dietary modifications

- **Phlebotomy**: First-line therapy to remove excess iron [^116Hqc7D].
- **Iron chelation**: Deferasirox or deferoxamine for patients intolerant to phlebotomy [^1164bxyb].
- **Dietary modifications**: Avoid iron and vitamin C supplements [^1119ivHV]; limit alcohol intake [^11443eCu].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Sevelamer is **not effective for hemochromatosis** because it does not bind iron or reduce iron absorption. The standard of care remains **phlebotomy** [^116Hqc7D], with chelation only when phlebotomy is not possible [^1164bxyb]. No evidence or guidelines support sevelamer for iron overload; its use should be avoided [^117GZvjU].

### Diagnosis and management of genetic iron overload disorders [^111YJN7G]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Iron overload disorders lead to excess iron deposition in the body, which can occur as a result of genetic or secondary causes. Genetic iron overload, referred to as hereditary hemochromatosis, may present as a common autosomal recessive mutation or as one of several uncommon mutations. Secondary iron overload may result from frequent blood transfusions, exogenous iron intake, or certain hematological diseases such as dyserythropoietic syndrome or chronic hemolytic anemia. Iron overload may be asymptomatic or may present with significant diseases of the liver, heart, endocrine glands, joints, or other organs. If treated appropriately prior to end-organ damage, life expectancy has been shown to be similar compared to matched populations. Alongside clinical assessment, diagnostic studies involve blood tests, imaging, and in some cases, liver biopsy. The mainstay of therapy is periodic phlebotomy, although oral chelation is an option for selected patients.

### Economic evaluation of sevelamer versus calcium-based phosphate binders in hemodialysis patients: A secondary analysis using Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services data [^1152hwEs]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2009). Low credibility.

A secondary analysis of the Dialysis Clinical Outcomes Revisited (DCOR) trial suggested that sevelamer reduced hospitalizations relative to calcium-based phosphate binders. However, whether changed medical costs associated with reduced hospitalizations or other medical services offset the higher cost of sevelamer is unclear. This DCOR secondary analysis aimed to (1) evaluate Medicare total, inpatient, outpatient, skilled nursing facility, and other costs in sevelamer-treated versus calcium-treated patients; (2) examine Medicare costs in specific categories to determine cost drivers; and (3) estimate and incorporate sevelamer and calcium binder costs.

- **Design, setting, participants, & measurements**: DCOR trial participants were linked to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services ESRD database. Medicare costs for 1895 dosed Medicare-primary-payer participants were evaluated. Phosphate binder costs were incorporated. Costs were indexed to 2001 (study base year). Sensitivity analyses were performed with randomized participants, two follow-up periods, and 2004 as the index year.

- **Results**: Inflation-adjusted Medicare per member per month (PMPM) costs were lower for sevelamer-treated than for calcium-treated participants by a mean differential of $199 PMPM (mean, $5236 versus $5435; median, $4653 versus $4933), mainly because of lower inpatient costs for the sevelamer group (mean, $1461 versus $1644; median, $909 versus $1144). However, after phosphate binder costs were incorporated, costs trended lower for calcium-treated than for sevelamer-treated patients.

### Diagnosis and management of hereditary hemochromatosis: Lifestyle modification, phlebotomy, and blood donation [^111ixfuK]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology Education Program (2024). Low credibility.

The term hemochromatosis refers to a group of genetic disorders characterized by hepcidin insufficiency in the context of normal erythropoiesis, iron hyperabsorption, and expansion of the plasma iron pool, with increased transferrin saturation, the diagnostic hallmark of the disease. This results in the formation of toxic non-transferrin-bound iron, which ultimately accumulates in multiple organs, including the liver, heart, endocrine glands, and joints.

The most common form is HFE-hemochromatosis (HFE-H) due to p. Cys282Tyr (C282Y) homozygosity, present in nearly 1 in 200 people of Northern European descent but characterized by low penetrance, particularly in females. Genetic and lifestyle cofactors (especially alcohol and dysmetabolic features) significantly modulate clinical expression, so that HFE-H can be considered a multifactorial disease. Nowadays, HFE-H is mostly diagnosed before organ damage and is easily treated by phlebotomy, with an excellent prognosis. After iron depletion, maintenance phlebotomy can be usefully transformed into a blood donation program. Lifestyle changes are important for management.

Non-HFE-H, much rarer but highly penetrant, may lead to early and severe heart, liver, and endocrine complications. Managing severe hemochromatosis requires a comprehensive approach optimally provided by consultation with specialized centers. In clinical practice, a proper diagnostic approach is paramount for patients referred for hyperferritinemia, a frequent finding that reflects hemochromatosis only in a minority of cases.

### A phase III study of the efficacy and safety of a novel iron-based phosphate binder in dialysis patients [^112evhQz]. Kidney International (2014). Low credibility.

PA21 was found to be non-inferior to SEV, as reductions in serum phosphorus concentrations were similar (0.71 and 0.79 mmol/l over the first 12 weeks of treatment, respectively) and maintained its phosphorus-lowering effect over 24 weeks with a considerably lower pill burden than SEV. In addition, treatment for 3 weeks with PA21 MD was superior to PA21 LD in maintaining serum phosphorus control after 24 weeks of treatment. Both primary and secondary efficacy objectives were met, demonstrating that PA21 is effective for the control of hyperphosphatemia in dialysis patients.

Patients undergoing dialysis often have multiple comorbid conditions and subsequently face a high pill burden, with one study showing a median of 19 tablets per day, and some dialysis patients taking more than 30 tablets per day. Phosphate binders accounted for 49% of this total daily tablet count, with a median daily pill burden of nine. Increased pill burden has been associated with reduced adherence to phosphate binders and lower quality of life. Non-adherence to phosphate binders, as high as 62% in patients with end-stage renal disease, has been associated with hyperphosphatemia, thus increasing the risk of secondary hyperparathyroidism, renal osteodystrophy, cardiovascular disease, and mortality. Recently published data from the pharmacy management program of a large dialysis provider indicate that phosphate binder pill burden is negatively associated with medication adherence (defined by the medication possession ratio), which, in turn, is negatively associated with mean phosphorus concentrations.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for hereditary hemochromatosis, particularly dietary modifications, EASL 2022 guidelines recommend advising patients with hemochromatosis and iron overload to avoid direct handling and consumption of raw or undercooked shellfish. Additionally, patients should avoid wound exposure to seawater, as these activities have been associated with a rare but serious systemic bacterial infection caused by Vibrio vulnificus and other siderophilic pathogens in certain geographical regions.

### Incremental cost-utility of sevelamer relative to calcium carbonate for treatment of hyperphosphatemia among pre-dialysis chronic kidney disease patients [^112s4nrg]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Sevelamer is an alternative to calcium carbonate for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia among non-dialysis dependent patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Although some studies show that it may reduce mortality and delay the onset of dialysis when compared to calcium carbonate, it is also significantly more expensive. Prior studies looking at the incremental cost-effectiveness of sevelamer versus calcium carbonate in pre-dialysis patients are based on data from a single clinical trial. The goal of our study is to use a wider range of clinical data to achieve a more contemporary and robust cost-effectiveness analysis.

- **Methods**: We used a Markov model to estimate the lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained for treatment with sevelamer versus calcium carbonate. The model simulated transitions among three health states (CKD not requiring dialysis, end-stage renal disease, and death). Data on transition probabilities and utilities were obtained from the published literature. Costs were calculated from a third-party payer perspective and included medication, hospitalization, and dialysis. Sensitivity analyses were also run to encompass a wide range of assumptions about the dose, costs, and effectiveness of sevelamer.

- **Results**: Over a lifetime, the average cost per patient treated with sevelamer is S$180,724. The estimated cost for patients treated with calcium carbonate is S$152,988. A patient treated with sevelamer gains, on average, 6.34 QALYs relative to no treatment, whereas a patient taking calcium carbonate gains 5.81 QALYs.

### Rusfertide for the treatment of iron overload in HFE-related haemochromatosis: an open-label, multicentre, proof-of-concept phase 2 trial [^111RotAY]. The Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Hereditary haemochromatosis protein (HFE)-related haemochromatosis, an inherited iron overload disorder caused by insufficient hepcidin production, results in excessive iron absorption and tissue and organ injury, and is treated with first-line therapeutic phlebotomy. We aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of rusfertide, a peptidic mimetic of hepcidin, in patients with HFE-related haemochromatosis.

- **Methods**: This open-label, multicentre, proof-of-concept phase 2 trial was conducted across nine academic and community centres in the United States and Canada. Adults (aged ≥ 18 years) with HFE-related haemochromatosis on a stable therapeutic phlebotomy regimen (maintenance phase) for at least 6 months before screening and who had a phlebotomy frequency of at least 0.25 per month (e.g. at least three phlebotomies in 12 months or at least four phlebotomies in 15 months) and less than one phlebotomy per month, with serum ferritin of less than 300 ng/mL and haemoglobin of more than 11.5 g/dL, were eligible. Patients initiated 24 weeks of subcutaneous rusfertide treatment within 7 days of a scheduled phlebotomy at 10 mg once weekly. Rusfertide doses and dosing schedules could be adjusted to maintain serum transferrin iron saturation (TSAT) at less than 40%. During rusfertide treatment, investigators were to consider the need for phlebotomy when the serum ferritin and TSAT values exceeded the patient's individual pre-phlebotomy serum ferritin and TSAT values. No primary endpoint or testing hierarchy was prespecified. Prespecified efficacy endpoints included the change in the frequency of phlebotomy sessions.

### Diagnosis and management of hemochromatosis: 2011 practice guideline by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^112BCrPS]. Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

Phlebotomy remains the mainstay of treatment for hereditary hemochromatosis (HH). One unit of blood contains approximately 200–250 mg of iron, depending on the hemoglobin concentration, and should be removed once or twice per week as tolerated. In patients with HH who may have total body iron stores greater than 30 g, therapeutic phlebotomy may take up to 2–3 years to adequately reduce iron stores.

Each phlebotomy should be preceded by measurement of the hematocrit or hemoglobin to avoid reducing the hematocrit/hemoglobin to less than 80% of the starting value. Transferrin saturation (TS) usually remains elevated until iron stores are depleted, whereas ferritin, which may initially fluctuate, eventually begins to fall progressively with iron mobilization and reflects the depletion of iron stores. Serum ferritin analysis should be performed after every 10–12 phlebotomies (approximately every 3 months) in the initial stages of treatment.

It can be confidently assumed that excess iron stores have been mobilized when the serum ferritin drops to between 50 and 100 µg/L. As the target range of 50–100 µg/L is approached, testing may be repeated more frequently to preempt the development of overt iron deficiency. It is not necessary for patients to achieve iron deficiency, and this should be avoided. Phlebotomy can be stopped once iron stores are depleted, and the patient should be assessed to determine if maintenance phlebotomy is needed. Not all patients with HH reaccumulate iron, and therefore, they may not require maintenance therapy.

### Diagnosis and management of hemochromatosis: 2011 practice guideline by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^114hUSfP]. Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

Once a patient with hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) has been identified (proband), family screening should be recommended for all first-degree relatives. For ease of testing, both genotype (HFE mutation analysis) and phenotype (ferritin and transferrin saturation) should be performed simultaneously at a single visit. For children of an identified proband, HFE testing of the other parent is generally recommended because, if results are normal, the child is an obligate heterozygote and need not undergo further testing as there is no increased risk of iron loading.

If C282Y homozygosity or compound heterozygosity is found in adult relatives of a proband and if serum ferritin levels are increased, then therapeutic phlebotomy can be initiated. If ferritin levels are normal in these patients, then yearly follow-up with iron studies is indicated. When identified, C282Y heterozygotes and H63D heterozygotes can be reassured that they are not at risk for developing progressive or symptomatic iron overload. Occasional H63D homozygotes can develop mild iron overload. However, it should be recognized that any of these genotypes can be a cofactor for the development of liver disease when they occur in conjunction with other liver diseases such as porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT), hepatitis C infection, alcoholic liver disease (ALD), or nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Relatives who are identified as H63D heterozygotes or H63D homozygotes can be reassured that they are generally not at risk of progressive iron overload, although they may have minor abnormalities in serum iron measurements such as transferrin saturation or ferritin.

Family studies have concluded that many homozygous relatives of probands demonstrate…

### Proton pump inhibition for secondary hemochromatosis in hereditary anemia: a phase III placebo-controlled randomized cross-over clinical trial [^114HvGqF]. American Journal of Hematology (2022). High credibility.

Iron overload is a serious complication in patients with transfusion-dependent congenital anemias. However, iron overload was also detected in 65% of a cohort of previously non-transfused patients with hereditary hemolytic anemia due to inappropriately low hepcidin levels, resulting in excessive intestinal iron absorption in response to ineffective or stress erythropoiesis. Upon erythropoietin stimulation, differentiating erythroblasts rapidly increase erythroferrone production, which downregulates hepcidin transcription. The resulting elevated levels of total body iron lead to clearance of non-transferrin-bound iron by the liver, culminating in iron overload and related pathology.

In patients with non-transfusion-dependent thalassemia, a liver iron content (LIC) threshold of 3–5 mg Fe/g dry weight (dw) was associated with a higher prevalence of iron-related morbidity, including vasculopathy, endocrine disturbances, and osseous complications. In non-transfusion-dependent thalassemia, LIC values increase approximately 0.5 mg Fe/g dw per year, already resulting in clinically relevant iron overload in adolescents. Recommendations for monitoring and treatment of iron overload are incorporated in all guidelines for management of hemoglobinopathies and other anemias. Iron chelation is currently the only treatment modality of iron overload in anemic patients. Treatment-related toxicity (e.g. gastrointestinal complaints and renal toxicity) is a concern in daily clinical practice, and treatment itself is expensive.

Dietary non-heme iron typically consists of

### EASL clinical practice guidelines for HFE hemochromatosis [^115VZpyQ]. Journal of Hepatology (2010). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for hereditary hemochromatosis, more specifically with respect to ferritin monitoring, EASL 2010 guidelines recommend considering annual monitoring of ferritin levels in C282Y homozygotes without evidence of iron overload. Treatment should be initiated when ferritin rises above normal levels.

### Oral deferiprone for iron chelation in people with thalassaemia [^117WEpE9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Thalassaemia major is a genetic disease characterized by a reduced ability to produce hemoglobin. Management of the resulting anemia is through red blood cell transfusions. Repeated transfusions result in an excessive accumulation of iron in the body (iron overload), the removal of which is achieved through iron chelation therapy. A commonly used iron chelator, deferiprone, has been found to be pharmacologically efficacious. However, important questions exist about the efficacy and safety of deferiprone compared to another iron chelator, desferrioxamine.

- **Objectives**: To summarize data from trials on the clinical efficacy and safety of deferiprone and to compare the clinical efficacy and safety of deferiprone with desferrioxamine for thalassaemia.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register and MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library), LILACS, and other international medical databases, plus registers of ongoing trials and the Transfusion Evidence Library (www.transfusionevidencelibrary.com). We also contacted the manufacturers of deferiprone and desferrioxamine. All searches were updated to 05 March 2013.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials comparing deferiprone with another iron chelator, or comparing two schedules or doses of deferiprone, in people with transfusion-dependent thalassaemia.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently assessed trials for risk of bias and extracted data. Missing data were requested from the original investigators.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for hereditary hemochromatosis, more specifically with respect to therapeutic phlebotomy, BSH 2018 guidelines recommend performing weekly phlebotomy in all fit patients with genetic hemochromatosis with biochemical evidence of iron loading, until serum ferritin is approximately 20–30 mcg/L and transferrin saturation is less than 50%. Complete blood count (CBC) should be monitored weekly, and serum ferritin and/or transferrin saturation should be monitored monthly during this phase of phlebotomy.

### Decrease in thoracic vertebral bone attenuation with calcium-based phosphate binders in hemodialysis [^115oVRqx]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2005). Low credibility.

We performed a post hoc analysis of a 52-week randomized trial conducted in adult hemodialysis patients that compared the effects of calcium-based phosphate binders and sevelamer, a nonabsorbable polymer, on parameters of mineral metabolism and vascular calcification by electron beam tomography. In this analysis, we evaluated the relative effects of calcium and sevelamer on thoracic vertebral attenuation by CT and markers of bone turnover. Subjects randomized to calcium salts experienced a significant reduction in trabecular bone attenuation and a trend toward reduction in cortical bone attenuation, in association with higher concentrations of serum calcium, lower concentrations of PTH, and reduced total and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase.

- **Introduction**: In patients with chronic kidney disease, hyperphosphatemia is associated with osteodystrophy, vascular and soft tissue calcification, and mortality. Calcium-based phosphate binders are commonly prescribed to reduce intestinal phosphate absorption and to attenuate secondary hyperparathyroidism. Clinicians and investigators have presumed that, in hemodialysis patients, calcium exerts beneficial effects on bone.

### Iron overload: What is the role of public health [^113c4YGZ]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Hereditary hemochromatosis type 1, also known as hereditary hemochromatosis classical (HHC), is an iron overload disorder associated, in most cases, with mutations of the hemochromatosis (HFE) gene. Although suggested algorithms for diagnosing iron overload are available, there are still questions about options for genetic and biochemical screening for hemochromatosis and the duration of treatment.

This article provides a summary of an expert workgroup meeting convened on September 24–25, 2009, entitled "Iron Overload: What is the Role of Public Health?" The purpose of the meeting was to enable subject matter experts to share their most recent clinical and scientific iron overload information and to facilitate the discussion of future endeavors, with special emphasis on the role of public health in this field. The two main topics were the research priorities of the field, including clinical, genetic, and public health issues, and concerns about the validity of screening recommendations for the condition.

Regarding medical management for hereditary hemochromatosis, and specifically with respect to treatment targets, BSH 2018 guidelines recommend aiming for serum ferritin levels of approximately 20–30 mcg/L and transferrin saturation below 50% through phlebotomy. It is advised to monitor CBC weekly, as well as serum ferritin and/or transferrin saturation monthly during phlebotomy.

Surveillance for hepatocellular cancer

In patients with HH who present with cirrhosis, the recent AASLD guidelines for HCC surveillance should be followed. These recommendations should be extended to patients with HH who have cirrhosis, whether they have had phlebotomy to restore normal iron levels. The relative risk for HCC is approximately 20, with an annual incidence of 3%-4%. Patients with HH with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis should be screened regularly for HCC as per AASLD guidelines.

### Diagnosis and management of hemochromatosis: 2011 practice guideline by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^113frUyS]. Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

Although there has never been a randomized controlled trial of phlebotomy versus no phlebotomy in the treatment of hemochromatosis (HH), there is evidence that initiation of phlebotomy before the development of cirrhosis and/or diabetes can significantly reduce the morbidity and mortality of HH. Therefore, early identification and preemptive treatment of those at risk is generally recommended. This includes treatment of asymptomatic individuals with homozygous HH and markers of iron overload, as well as others with evidence of increased levels of hepatic iron. In symptomatic patients, treatment is also advocated to reduce the progression of organ damage.

- **Clinical features impacted by phlebotomy**: Certain clinical features are likely to be ameliorated by phlebotomy, such as malaise, fatigue, skin pigmentation, insulin requirements for diabetics, and abdominal pain. However, other features are either less responsive to iron removal or do not respond at all. These include arthropathy, hypogonadism, and advanced cirrhosis. In some cases, hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis show regression after phlebotomy.

- **Ongoing risks and complications**: The life-threatening complications of established cirrhosis, particularly hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), continue to be a threat to survival even after adequate phlebotomy. Therefore, patients with cirrhosis should continue to be screened for HCC following phlebotomy. HCC accounts for approximately 30% of HH-related deaths, whereas complications of cirrhosis account for an additional 20%. HCC is exceptionally rare in noncirrhotic HH, which provides an additional argument for preventive therapy prior to the development of cirrhosis.

### Incremental cost-utility of sevelamer relative to calcium carbonate for treatment of hyperphosphatemia among pre-dialysis chronic kidney disease patients [^114iKq8j]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Transition probabilities were obtained from published studies and from our own calculations. The probabilities for transitioning to dialysis in each cycle were obtained from Di Iorio et al, which presents results of a three-year randomized controlled trial designed to test the clinical effectiveness of sevelamer versus calcium carbonate for treatment of hyperphosphatemia among CKD patients in Italy.

Although Di Iorio et al. also contains mortality transition probabilities, this data is only available for the three-year duration of the clinical trial. Further, in an erratum it was clarified that patients were right-censored (i.e. removed) from analysis when they entered dialysis. As a result, the mortality data from their paper is not an accurate representation of the lifetime mortality hazard. Therefore, we estimated mortality transition probabilities based on data from the literature. To estimate mortality risks of non-dialysis CKD patients, we used data on three parameters: (a) age-specific mortality risks from Singapore life tables, (b) mortality hazard ratios for CKD patients relative to non-CKD patients based on a large Taiwanese cohort study, and (c) mortality hazard ratios for sevelamer relative to calcium carbonate among CKD patients obtained from a recent meta-analysis.

Specifically, we first inflated the age-specific mortality risks from the Singapore life tables by the hazard ratio for CKD patients. These inflated mortality risks were assumed to be the mortality risks for CKD patients treated with calcium carbonate, which is currently.

### Effects of sucroferric oxyhydroxide and sevelamer carbonate on chronic kidney disease-mineral bone disorder parameters in dialysis patients [^114Uo17d]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). High credibility.

- **Materials and methods**: This was a two-stage, randomized, active-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter, open-label, Phase 3 study (NCT01324128) investigating the efficacy and safety of sucroferric oxyhydroxide versus sevelamer, followed by an extension study (NCT01464190) in dialysis patients with hyperphosphataemia. Full details of the study designs have been previously described.

	- The protocol was reviewed by independent ethics committees or institutional review boards. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki Principles and the International Conference on Harmonisation E6 Guideline for Good Clinical Practice, Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products guideline (CPMP/ICH/135/95), and was compliant with the European Union Clinical Trial Directive (Directive 2001/20/EC) and the Code of Federal Regulations for informed consent and protection of patient rights.

- **Participants**: The full inclusion and exclusion criteria for the study participants have been described elsewhere. In brief, eligible study patients were aged ≥ 18 years, had a history of hyperphosphataemia, and had been prescribed stable doses of phosphate binders for ≥ 1 month before screening. Participants required maintenance haemodialysis three times per week or peritoneal dialysis for ≥ 3 months before screening and had serum phosphate levels ≥ 1.94 mmol/L during washout. Patients were ineligible if, at screening, they had intact PTH (iPTH) levels > 88 pmol/L or serum ferritin > 4494 pmol/L.

### How I treat hemochromatosis [^112S6Yv4]. Blood (2010). Low credibility.

Hemochromatosis is a common genetic disorder in which iron may progressively accumulate in the liver, heart, and other organs. The primary goal of therapy is iron depletion to normalize body iron stores and to prevent or decrease organ dysfunction. The primary therapy to normalize iron stores is phlebotomy. In this opinion article, we discuss the indications for and monitoring of phlebotomy therapy to achieve iron depletion, maintenance therapy, dietary and pharmacologic maneuvers that could reduce iron absorption, and the role of voluntary blood donation.

### Iron-related parameters in dialysis patients treated with sucroferric oxyhydroxide [^111tt9B1]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2017). Low credibility.

The majority of patients in the sucroferric oxyhydroxide and sevelamer groups received concomitant intravenous (IV) iron and/or erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) products at least once during the one-year study. The percentages of patients were as follows: IV iron was used by 73.6% and 80.6% of patients, while ESA products were used by 85.4% and 89.4% of patients, respectively, in the sucroferric oxyhydroxide and sevelamer groups.

- **Comparison of concomitant IV iron use**: In both treatment groups, the proportion of patients receiving concomitant IV iron was greater during Weeks 0–24 compared with Weeks 24–52. Over these periods, the proportion of patients receiving IV iron and ESA was marginally higher in the sevelamer group compared with the sucroferric oxyhydroxide group. This difference in concomitant ESA use was statistically significant between treatment groups between Weeks 24 and 52 (P = 0.025).

- **Figure 2 interpretation**: Proportion of patients receiving concomitant anti-anaemic products — IV iron (A) and ESAs (B) — at different time periods over one year (completer set; n = 549). ✱ p = 0.0252 indicates a statistically significant difference for sucroferric oxyhydroxide versus sevelamer carbonate between specified periods. Week 0 is the baseline of the initial Phase 3 study. ESAs, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents; IV, intravenous.

### Evaluation of calcium acetate/magnesium carbonate as a phosphate binder compared with sevelamer hydrochloride in haemodialysis patients: a controlled randomized study (CALMAG study) assessing efficacy and tolerability [^112HXWFk]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2010). Low credibility.

Safety parameters

- **Adverse events**: The number of patients with adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) were comparable in both treatment groups. There was no difference regarding the occurrence of any AEs between groups. In the calcium acetate/magnesium carbonate (CaMg) group, fewer patients experienced AEs leading to study withdrawal. The intensity of about 80% of AEs was classified as mild. A total of 16.1% of AEs in the CaMg group and 19.7% in sevelamer hydrochloride-treated patients were classified as moderate, while 4.0% and 2.5% of AEs, respectively, were judged to be severe. None of the SAEs was judged to be related; their number was slightly lower in the CaMg group. Related gastrointestinal AEs were more frequently noted in the sevelamer hydrochloride group (23.6% of subjects vs. 13.6% in the CaMg group). Related metabolism disorders, such as electrolyte disturbances, were more frequent in the CaMg group, most of them were episodes of asymptomatic hypermagnesemia reported as related AE by the treating physician (8.8% vs. 2.4% in the sevelamer hydrochloride group). In none of the other AEs was there any difference between groups, particularly in relation to cardiac dysrhythmia, muscle spasm, or cramps.

- **Other haematology, biochemistry parameters, vital signs**: Mean ± SD values of haematology, bedside laboratory, Kt/V, and serum chemistry parameters fluctuated within the expected normal variation in both treatment groups. The same applied to vital signs and ECG.

### Systematic review of the clinical efficacy and safety of sevelamer in dialysis patients [^112gMakC]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2007). Low credibility.

The relative effectiveness and safety of sevelamer for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia in dialysis patients is uncertain compared to calcium-based phosphate binders.

- **Methods**: We conducted a comprehensive search to identify all randomized cross-over or parallel group studies comparing sevelamer to any other therapy or placebo in adult dialysis patients. Study quality was assessed using the Chalmers Index. Data were extracted and checked using a standardized form and combined using a random effects model.

- **Results**: We identified 14 primary publications of randomized trials (3193 participants) that were eligible for efficacy analysis. In analyses pooling the 10 studies reporting on serum phosphate and calcium (2501 participants), serum phosphate was significantly lower with calcium-based phosphate binders by 0.12 mmol/l (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.05–0.19) compared with sevelamer. On-treatment calcium-phosphate product was not significantly lower in patients receiving calcium-based phosphate binders (0.12 mmol²/l², -0.05 to 0.29) compared with sevelamer. Overall mean difference in serum calcium was significantly lower with sevelamer therapy by 0.10 mmol/l (-0.12 to -0.07) and pooled on-treatment decrease in serum bicarbonate was significantly greater with sevelamer therapy by 2.8 mmol/l (2.2 to -3.5). In the five trials which reported all-cause mortality (2429 participants), the overall risk difference for all-cause mortality in these five trials was similar between therapies (-2%, 95% CI -6–2).

### Diagnosis and management of hemochromatosis: 2011 practice guideline by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^114pLfpD]. Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

The decision to treat hemochromatosis (HH) with phlebotomy is straightforward and easy to justify for patients with evidence of liver disease or other end-organ manifestations. The more difficult situation arises with a C282Y homozygote patient who has a ferritin level of 800 μg/L, for example, with normal liver tests and no symptoms. Longitudinal data are limited; some patients in this category may never progress to more serious problems and may not need treatment. However, treatment is easy, safe, inexpensive, and could conceivably provide societal benefits, such as blood donation, and thus treatment is often initiated. Furthermore, there are no reliable indicators available to predict who will develop complications. Conceivably, the rate of increase of serum ferritin could prove, in the future, to be an indicator of potential tissue and organ damage. In the absence of results from controlled trials, we currently favor proceeding with prophylactic phlebotomy in individuals who tolerate and adhere to the regimen.

In patients with advanced disease, who may have cardiac arrhythmias or cardiomyopathy, there is an increased risk of sudden death with rapid mobilization of iron. This is most likely due to the presence of intracellular iron in a relatively toxic, low-molecular-weight chelate pool. Pharmacological doses of vitamin C accelerate mobilization of iron to a level that may saturate circulating transferrin, resulting in an increase in pro-oxidant and/or free radical activity. Therefore, supplemental vitamin C should be avoided by iron-loaded patients.

### A phase III study of the efficacy and safety of a novel iron-based phosphate binder in dialysis patients [^113ghfzN]. Kidney International (2014). Low credibility.

Results from this phase III study indicate the analysis sets and patient disposition in the trial were robust. Overall, 1059 patients were randomized. Of these, four did not receive treatment (Figure 2), leaving 1055 patients included in the safety set (SS). Among these, 1041 patients were part of the full analysis set (FAS), described as those randomized to treatment who received at least one dose of study medication and had one postbaseline evaluable efficacy assessment. The per-protocol set (PPS; n = 685) included patients who met the FAS criteria, completed the baseline treatment to week 12, and had at least one evaluable serum phosphorus result at or after week 12 with no major protocol deviations.

- **Patient disposition**: As shown in Figure 2, reasons for screening failures included unmet entry criteria (excluding serum phosphorus concentration; 39.1%), serum phosphorus concentration < 1.94 mmol/l (34.3%), withdrawal of consent (6.4%), investigator decision (1.8%), death during screening/washout (0.3%), and other reasons (18.4%).

- **Patient baseline demographics**: Documented in Table 1, treatment groups were mostly similar with regard to baseline characteristics, showing no major demographic subgroup differences. High percentages (92%) of patients were undergoing HD.

- **Protocol deviations and adherence**: The most common major protocol deviations included non-adherence to study treatment (19.5%), treatment duration of 11 weeks or less (13.2%), and usage of phosphate binders during washout or non-study phosphate binders between baseline and week 12 (5.6%).

### Diagnosis and management of hemochromatosis: 2011 practice guideline by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^117F6zEM]. Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

The treatment of secondary iron overload has been primarily concentrated on the management of hereditary hemochromatosis (HH). However, it is reasonable to also review the treatment of non-inherited forms of secondary iron overload.

- **Causes of secondary iron overload**: These are listed in Table 3.

- **Phlebotomy**: This is useful in certain forms of secondary iron overload (Table 8). It is clearly indicated in patients with porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) and results in a reduction in skin manifestations. Total iron stores rarely exceed 4–5 grams. Secondary iron overload is sometimes seen in association with chronic hepatitis C, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and alcoholic liver disease (ALD).

- **Alcoholic liver disease (ALD)**: There is no published evidence that phlebotomy is beneficial.

- **Chronic hepatitis C**: Phlebotomy therapy has been shown to reduce elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels and achieve a marginal improvement in histopathology, but it has no effect on virologic clearance. Currently, phlebotomy is not recommended for mild secondary iron overload (hepatic iron concentration, HIC < 2500 μg/g dry weight) in chronic hepatitis C.

- **Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)**: Studies have shown a benefit of therapeutic phlebotomy with improvement in parameters of insulin resistance and reduction in elevated ALT levels. Large-scale studies in patients with NAFLD have been proposed.

### EASL clinical practice guidelines on haemochromatosis [^11443eCu]. Journal of Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for hereditary hemochromatosis, particularly in terms of dietary modifications, the EASL 2022 guidelines recommend restricting alcohol intake during the iron depletion phase of treatment. Patients with iron overload and/or liver abnormalities are advised to avoid or consume very little alcohol. Furthermore, patients with cirrhosis should abstain entirely from alcohol consumption.

### A phase III study of the efficacy and safety of a novel iron-based phosphate binder in dialysis patients [^1129HBab]. Kidney International (2014). Low credibility.

The efficacy of PA21 (sucroferric oxyhydroxide), a novel calcium-free polynuclear iron(III)-oxyhydroxide phosphate binder, was compared with that of sevelamer carbonate in an open-label, randomized, active-controlled phase III study. Seven hundred and seven hemo- and peritoneal dialysis patients with hyperphosphatemia received PA21 at 1.0–3.0 g per day, and 348 patients received sevelamer at 4.8–14.4 g per day for an 8-week dose titration, followed by 4 weeks without dose change, and then 12 weeks of maintenance. Serum phosphorus reductions at week 12 were -0.71 mmol/l for PA21 and -0.79 mmol/l for sevelamer, demonstrating non-inferiority of, on average, three tablets of PA21 compared to eight tablets of sevelamer. Efficacy was maintained to week 24.

- **Adherence and adverse events**: Non-adherence was 15.1% for PA21 compared to 21.3% for sevelamer. The percentage of patients who reported at least one treatment-emergent adverse event was 83.2% with PA21 and 76.1% with sevelamer. A higher proportion of patients withdrew due to treatment-emergent adverse events with PA21 (15.7%) compared to sevelamer (6.6%).

- **Adverse events comparison**: Mild, transient diarrhea, discolored feces, and hyperphosphatemia were more frequent with PA21, while nausea and constipation were more frequent with sevelamer.

After 24 weeks, 99 hemodialysis patients on PA21 were re-randomized into a 3-week superiority analysis for the PA21 maintenance dose in 50 patients compared to a low dose (250 mg per day, ineffective control) in 49 patients. The PA21 maintenance dose was superior to the low dose in maintaining serum phosphorus control. Thus, PA21 was effective in lowering serum phosphorus in dialysis patients, with similar efficacy to sevelamer.

### A comparison of calcium acetate/magnesium carbonate and sevelamer-hydrochloride effects on fibroblast growth factor-23 and bone markers: Post hoc evaluation from a controlled, randomized study [^111yryST]. Nephrology Dialysis Transplantation (2013). Low credibility.

In patients with chronic kidney disease stage 5 (CKD 5), elevated serum phosphorus (P) levels are associated with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Therefore, controlling serum P levels is a key objective in the management of chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder (CKD–MBD). In addition to optimal dialysis and dietary restrictions, oral phosphate binders such as calcium (Ca) acetate and the non-Ca-containing agent sevelamer-hydrochloride (HCl) constitute key treatment options in hyperphosphatemia.

The recent CALcium acetate MAGnesium carbonate (CALMAG) randomized, controlled trial demonstrated that the combination phosphate binder calcium acetate/magnesium carbonate (CaMg) is non-inferior to sevelamer-HCl at controlling serum P levels in patients receiving haemodialysis (HD), thus presenting another effective treatment option.

Hyperphosphatemia is associated with elevated levels of fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23) and parathyroid hormone (PTH). Increased FGF-23, hyperphosphatemia, and elevated PTH are independently associated with increased mortality in CKD. FGF-23, a master regulator of P, PTH, and 1,25-(OH)2D3, is also implicated in cardiovascular disease and is becoming increasingly recognized as an important marker for outcome and severity of disease in CKD–MBD. However, there are currently very few strategies available to enable a significant reduction in its level in patients with CKD.

Recent studies have reported a greater reduction in FGF-23 with sevelamer-HCl than with Ca acetate, and therefore, there remains interest in exploring these findings further.

### Diagnosis and management of hemochromatosis: 2011 practice guideline by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^116VTxiw]. Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

The clinical diagnosis of hemochromatosis is based on the documentation of increased iron stores, demonstrated by elevated serum ferritin levels, which reflect an increase in hepatic iron content. Hemochromatosis (HH) can be further defined genotypically by the familial occurrence of iron overload associated with C282Y homozygosity or C282Y/H63D compound heterozygosity. Serologic iron markers, such as transferrin saturation (TS) and ferritin, are widely available, and the majority of patients with HH are now identified while still asymptomatic and without evidence of hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis.

Certain high-risk groups should be targeted for evaluation, such as those with a family history of HH, suspected organ involvement, and chance detection of biochemical and/or radiological abnormalities suggestive of the possibility of iron overload. It is generally recommended that all patients with abnormal liver function undergo iron studies at some point in their evaluation. An algorithm (referenced as Fig. 3 in previous guidelines) can provide further direction regarding testing and treatment for HH. This algorithm is modified from the version used in the previous AASLD guidelines.

The initial approach to diagnosis involves indirect markers of iron stores, namely transferrin saturation or unsaturated iron-binding capacity and serum ferritin. TS is calculated from the ratio of serum iron to the total iron-binding capacity.

### How we manage patients with hereditary haemochromatosis [^115k8dHG]. British Journal of Haematology (2016). Low credibility.

A number of disorders cause iron overload: some are of genetic origin, such as hereditary haemochromatosis, while others are acquired, for instance due to repeated transfusions. This article reviews the treatment options for hereditary haemochromatosis, with special attention to the use of erythrocytapheresis. In general, therapy is based on the removal of excess body iron, for which ferritin levels are used to monitor the effectiveness of treatment.

For many decades, phlebotomy has been widely accepted as the standard treatment. Recent publications suggest that erythrocytapheresis, as a more individualized treatment, can provide a good balance between effectiveness, tolerability, and costs. Other treatments like oral chelators and proton pump inhibitors, which are used in selected patients, create the possibility to further individualize treatment of hereditary haemochromatosis. In the future, hepcidin-targeted therapy could provide a more fundamental approach to treatment.

### Proton pump inhibition for secondary hemochromatosis in hereditary anemia: a phase III placebo-controlled randomized cross-over clinical trial [^116FhZtR]. American Journal of Hematology (2022). High credibility.

In this phase III trial involving patients with non‐transfusion‐dependent anemias complicated by mild‐to‐severe iron overload, esomeprazole 40 mg twice daily resulted in a significantly larger reduction in liver iron load of 0.55 mg Fe/g dw compared to placebo after 1 year of treatment. We consider this difference clinically relevant given the average iron loading per year of 0.5 mg Fe/g dw in patients with non‐transfusion‐dependent thalassemia as observed previously. A low individual hepcidin/ferritin ratio was an important predictor for treatment efficacy. Moreover, we established the safety of esomeprazole treatment for this specific indication; esomeprazole was associated with mainly low‐grade adverse events.

The cross‐over design of our study enabled us to include a heterogeneous group of anemias, which can be considered both a strength and a weakness of the trial. The underlying mechanism of iron loading is similar among these diseases, despite major differences in pathophysiology. Unfortunately, the low number of patients included per disease was too small to allow separate (sensitivity) subgroup analyses. The potency to accumulate iron in the absence of transfusions in SCD is a subject of debate; however, there is a subgroup of SCD patients with extremely low hepcidin/ferritin ratios who may be at risk of iron overload via this route.

We chose to dose esomeprazole twice daily to attain 24-hour gastric acid suppression. Pharmacokinetic data of esomeprazole showed that 40 mg once daily attained pH ≥ 4 in 92% and 56% of patients for a minimal duration of respecti…

### Potential antiatherogenic and anti-inflammatory properties of sevelamer in maintenance hemodialysis patients [^1161RE1d]. American Heart Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Patients affected by end-stage renal disease (ESRD) demonstrate a very high cardiovascular risk mediated by traditional cardiovascular risk factors as well as abnormal mineral metabolism and a state of chronic inflammation. Sevelamer is a nonabsorbable non-calcium-based hydrogel with potential antiatherosclerotic properties.

- **Method and results**: One hundred eight patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis were randomized to sevelamer or calcium acetate as treatment for hyperphosphatemia. A coronary artery calcium score, as a measure of plaque burden, was calculated at baseline and 1 year, along with serial measurements of serum lipoproteins, beta2-microglobulin, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP). At 1 year, the coronary artery calcium score progressed significantly from baseline in calcium acetate-treated subjects (P < .001) but not in sevelamer-treated patients (P = NS). Total cholesterol (P < .0001), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P < .0001), apolipoprotein B (P < .0001), beta2-microglobulin (P = 0.018), and hs-CRP (P < .002) decreased, and high-density lipoprotein increased significantly (P = 0.036) from baseline in the sevelamer-treated subjects but not in subjects treated with calcium acetate despite the more frequent use of statins in the latter group (46% vs 22%, P < .05). The changes in total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, and hs-CRP were significantly different between treatment groups (all P < .01).

- **Conclusions**: Sevelamer leads to favorable changes in lipids and inflammatory markers with potentially useful effects on cardiovascular risk in hemodialysis patients.

### Hereditary hemochromatosis [^1157Rj5X]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Hereditary hemochromatosis is an autosomal recessive disorder that disrupts the body's regulation of iron. It is the most common genetic disease in whites. Men have a 24-fold increased rate of iron-overload disease compared with women. Persons who are homozygous for the HFE gene mutation C282Y comprise 85 to 90 percent of phenotypically affected persons. End-organ damage or clinical manifestations of hereditary hemochromatosis occur in approximately 10 percent of persons homozygous for C282Y.

Symptoms of hereditary hemochromatosis are nonspecific and typically absent in the early stages. If present, symptoms may include weakness, lethargy, arthralgias, and impotence. Later manifestations include arthralgias, osteoporosis, cirrhosis, hepatocellular cancer, cardiomyopathy, dysrhythmia, diabetes mellitus, and hypogonadism. Diagnosis requires confirmation of increased serum ferritin levels and transferrin saturation, with or without symptoms. Subtyping is based on genotypic expression. Serum ferritin measurement is the most useful prognostic indicator of disease severity.

Liver biopsy is performed to stage the degree of fibrosis with severe ferritin elevation or transaminitis, or to diagnose nonclassical hereditary hemochromatosis in patients with other genetic defects. Treatment of hereditary hemochromatosis requires phlebotomy, and the frequency is guided by serial measurements of serum ferritin levels and transferrin saturation. Iron avidity can result from overtreatment. If iron avidity is not suspected, it may mimic undertreatment with persistently elevated transferrin saturation.

### Characterization of ferroptosis in murine models of hemochromatosis [^115b4aDs]. Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

These findings have several key implications. First, we provide evidence of ferroptosis in mouse models of hemochromatosis, and we show that targeting ferroptosis using the specific inhibitor Ferr‐1 rescues liver damage in these mice. Recent studies reported that ferroptosis is driven by the peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids, particularly oxidized arachidonic acid and adrenic acid phosphatidylethanolamines. Consistent with these findings, high levels of lipid peroxidation in cellular membranes result in cell death and organ damage in patients with HH. Although Ferr‐1 did not change iron levels in Hjv –/– and Smad4 Alb/Alb mice, it significantly decreased hepatic MDA content, suggesting that scavenging lipid peroxidases partially inhibits ferroptosis‐related damage even under iron‐overload conditions.

Currently, therapeutic strategies for treating hemochromatosis are limited to phlebotomy and iron chelators, which can reduce iron levels. Our results indicate that inhibiting ferroptosis may be a feasible approach for treating and/or preventing hemochromatosis. On the other hand, inducing ferroptosis may be an effective strategy for killing oncogenic Ras‐mutated tumor cells, which are usually resistant to apoptosis. Given that SLC7A11 may function as an oncogene in various tumor cell types, it may be possible to induce ferroptosis by pharmacologically inhibiting SLC7A11 (e.g. with erastin, sulfasalazine, or sorafenib). Importantly, our results show that deleting Slc7a11 expression in otherwise normal (i.e. noncancerous) cells is significant in this context.

### The efficacy and safety of sevelamer and lanthanum versus calcium-containing and iron-based binders in treating hyperphosphatemia in patients with chronic kidney disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111JjcNn]. Nephrology Dialysis Transplantation (2017). Low credibility.

It remains unclear which phosphate binders should be preferred for hyperphosphatemia management in chronic kidney disease (CKD).

- **Methods**: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials comparing sevelamer or lanthanum with other phosphate binders in CKD.

- **Results**: Fifty-one trials (8,829 patients) were reviewed. Compared with calcium-based binders, all-cause mortality was nonsignificantly lower with sevelamer (risk ratio [RR] 0.62 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.35–1.08]) and lanthanum (RR 0.73 [95% CI 0.18–3.00]), although risk of bias was concerning. Sevelamer reduced the risk of hypercalcemia (RR 0.27 [95% CI 0.17–0.42]), as did lanthanum (RR 0.12 [95% CI 0.05–0.32]). Hospitalizations were reduced with sevelamer (RR 0.50 [95% CI 0.31–0.81]), but not with lanthanum (RR 0.80 [95% CI 0.34–1.93]). The presence or absence of other clinically relevant outcomes was infrequently reported. Compared with calcium-based binders, sevelamer reduced serum calcium, low-density lipoprotein, and coronary artery calcification but increased intact parathyroid hormone. The clinical relevance of these changes is unknown since corresponding clinical outcomes were not reported. Lanthanum had a less favorable impact on biochemical parameters. Sevelamer hydrochloride and sevelamer carbonate were similar in three studies. Sevelamer was similar to lanthanum (three studies) and iron-based binders (three studies).

- **Conclusion**: Sevelamer was associated with a nonsignificant reduction in mortality and significantly lower hospitalization rates and hypercalcemia.

### Iron replacement therapy: Do we need new guidelines [^114JkrER]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

The global prevalence of anemia affects approximately one-third of the population, with at least half of these cases attributed to iron deficiency. The advent of new intravenous iron preparations over the last decade has led to uncertainty regarding their administration and the appropriate circumstances for using oral therapy effectively.

Numerous guidelines exist, yet they lack detailed recommendations on therapeutic start and end points. They also fail to address the treatment of iron-deficiency anemia based on the underlying cause or the presence of additional diseases.

This study identifies key considerations for updating future guidelines to optimize iron replacement therapy. It suggests criteria for assessing treatment needs, determining the timing for initiation and discontinuation, scheduling follow-ups for potential relapses, and recommending appropriate dosages and types of therapy. Additionally, it considers the situations in which certain patients might not benefit from treatment.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hemochromatosis [^1146DJTB]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Hemochromatosis is not a new disease, and genetic variants for hemochromatosis have been identified in human fossils that are over 4000 years old in Northwestern Europe. These variants were postulated to promote iron absorption as a survival benefit. In contrast, excess iron absorption can lead to serious complications, including arthritis, liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, primary liver cancer, and diabetes. In this review, the emphasis is on recent developments in the diagnosis and treatment of hemochromatosis, focusing on those homozygous for the C282Y variant in the HFE gene. In this condition, there is a clear need for earlier diagnosis, leading to earlier treatment, to prevent morbidity and mortality from iron overload.

### Sevelamer versus calcium carbonate in incident hemodialysis patients: Results of an open-label 24-month randomized clinical trial [^115YiBBG]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). High credibility.

Whether the use of sevelamer rather than a calcium-containing phosphate binder improves cardiovascular (CV) survival in patients receiving dialysis remains to be elucidated.

- **Study design**: Open-label randomized controlled trial with parallel groups.

- **Settings & participants**: 466 incident hemodialysis patients recruited from 18 centers in Italy.

- **Intervention**: Study participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 fashion to receive either sevelamer or a calcium-containing phosphate binder. Although not required by the protocol, all patients in this group received calcium carbonate for 24 months.

- **Outcomes**: All individuals were followed up until completion of 36 months of follow-up or censoring. CV death due to cardiac arrhythmias was regarded as the primary endpoint.

- **Measurements**: Blind event adjudication.

- **Results**: At baseline, patients allocated to sevelamer had higher serum phosphorus (mean, 5.6 ± 1.7 mg/dL vs. 4.8 ± 1.4 mg/dL) and C-reactive protein levels (mean, 8.8 ± 13.4 mg/dL vs. 5.9 ± 6.8 mg/dL) and lower coronary artery calcification scores (median, 19 [IQR, 0–30] vs. 30 [IQR, 7–180]). At study completion, serum phosphate levels were lower in the sevelamer arm (median dosages, 4,800 mg/d and 2,000 mg/d for sevelamer and calcium carbonate, respectively). After a mean follow-up of 28 ± 10 months, 128 deaths were recorded (29 due to cardiac arrhythmias and 88 due to all-cause CV death). Sevelamer-treated patients experienced lower CV mortality due to cardiac arrhythmias compared with patients treated with calcium carbonate (HR, 0.06; 95% CI, 0.01–0.25; P < 0.001).

### Diagnosis and current treatments for primary iron overload [^113krY16]. American Journal of Hematology (2007). Low credibility.

Primary iron overload encompasses a variety of genetic iron overload syndromes, dominated in frequency by HFE-related or Type 1 hemochromatosis, for which French diagnostic and therapeutic guidelines have been recently proposed. Differential diagnosis of Type 1 hemochromatosis can be made from both clinical data and genetic studies. Venesection therapy and family screening remain the basis for the curative and preventive management of most genetic iron overload diseases.

### Sevelamer carbonate lowers serum phosphorus effectively in haemodialysis patients: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-titration study [^114Zm83W]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2014). Low credibility.

Hyperphosphatemia in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with adverse outcomes, including vascular calcification and higher mortality rates. While phosphate lowering is an integral aspect of CKD management, the efficacy and safety of phosphate binders in a contemporary cohort of Chinese haemodialysis patients (who have different genetics and dietary patterns than other populations) has not been previously described. Moreover, sparse data are available on strategies for optimal dose titration when transitioning from a calcium-based to a polymer-based phosphate binder.

- **Methods**: This randomized, double-blind, dose-titration study compared sevelamer carbonate (starting dose 800 mg three times daily) with placebo over 8 weeks' duration in Chinese CKD patients on haemodialysis. Patients were required to be using calcium-based binders prior to the study start.

- **Results**: In total, 205 patients were randomized (sevelamer, n = 135; placebo, n = 70); the mean age was 48.6 years, 61% were male, and the mean time on dialysis was 4.4 years. The mean serum phosphorus decreased significantly in patients treated with sevelamer carbonate [change -0.69 ± 0.64 mmol/L (-2.14 ± 1.98 mg/dL)] but remained persistently elevated with placebo [change -0.06 ± 0.57 mmol/L (-0.19 ± 1.76 mg/dL)] (P < 0.0001). When compared with placebo, sevelamer carbonate treatment resulted in statistically significant greater mean reductions from baseline in serum total cholesterol (-17.1% versus -3.3%) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-33.5% versus -7.6%) (P < 0.0001 for both).

### Sevelamer attenuates the progression of coronary and aortic calcification in hemodialysis patients [^111ZMLj6]. Kidney International (2002). High credibility.

Cardiovascular disease is frequent and severe in patients with end-stage renal disease. Disorders of mineral metabolism may contribute by promoting cardiovascular calcification.

- **Methods**: We conducted a randomized clinical trial comparing sevelamer, a non-absorbed polymer, with calcium-based phosphate binders in 200 hemodialysis patients. Study outcomes included the targeted concentrations of serum phosphorus, calcium, and intact parathyroid hormone (PTH), and calcification of the coronary arteries and thoracic aorta using a calcification score derived from electron beam tomography.

- **Results**: Sevelamer and calcium provided equivalent control of serum phosphorus (end-of-study values 5.1 ± 1.2 and 5.1 ± 1.4 mg/dL, respectively, P = 0.33). Serum calcium concentration was significantly higher in the calcium-treated group (P = 0.002), and hypercalcemia was more common (16% vs. 5% with sevelamer, P = 0.04). More subjects in the calcium group had end-of-study intact PTH below the target of 150 to 300 pg/mL (57% vs. 30%, P = 0.001). At study completion, the median absolute calcium score in the coronary arteries and aorta increased significantly in the calcium-treated subjects but not in the sevelamer-treated subjects (coronary arteries 36.6 vs. 0, P = 0.03 and aorta 75.1 vs. 0, P = 0.01, respectively). The median percent change in coronary artery (25% vs. 6%, P = 0.02) and aortic (28% vs. 5%, P = 0.02) calcium score also was significantly greater with calcium than with sevelamer.

In conclusion, compared with calcium-based phosphate binders, sevelamer is less likely to cause an increase in calcification of the coronary arteries and aorta.

### ACG clinical guideline: Hereditary hemochromatosis [^117GZvjU]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is one of the most common genetic disorders among persons of northern European descent. There have been recent advances in the diagnosis, management, and treatment of HH. The availability of molecular diagnostic testing for HH has made confirmation of the diagnosis possible for most patients. Several genotype-phenotype correlation studies have clarified differences in clinical features between patients with the C282Y homozygous genotypes and those with other HFE mutation patterns.

The increasing use of noninvasive tests such as MRI T2✱ has facilitated the quantification of hepatic iron deposition and eliminated the need for liver biopsy in most patients. Serum ferritin of < 1,000 ng/mL at diagnosis remains an important diagnostic test to identify patients with a low risk of advanced hepatic fibrosis and should be used routinely as part of the initial diagnostic evaluation. Genetic testing for other types of HH is available, but is expensive and generally not useful in most clinical settings.

Serum ferritin may be elevated among patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and those with alcoholic liver disease. These diagnoses are more common than HH among patients with elevated serum ferritin who are not C282Y homozygotes or C282Y/H63D compound heterozygotes. A secondary cause for liver disease should be excluded among patients with suspected iron overload who are not C282Y homozygotes.

Phlebotomy remains the mainstay of therapy, but emerging novel therapies such as new chelating agents may play a role for selected patients.

### A phase III study of the efficacy and safety of a novel iron-based phosphate binder in dialysis patients [^1116N15i]. Kidney International (2014). Low credibility.

The study analyses involved various patient populations. The FAS comprised patients randomized to treatment who received ⩾1 dose of study medication and had at least one post-baseline evaluable efficacy assessment. The PPS consisted of patients who, in addition to the FAS criteria, had completed the treatment course from baseline to week 12, had at least one evaluable serum phosphorus result at or after week 12, and had no major protocol deviations. The SS comprised all randomized patients who took at least one dose of study medication. The primary efficacy set comprised patients who were randomized to stage 2, received ⩾1 dose of study medication during stage 2, and had ⩾1 evaluable postbaseline efficacy assessment during stage 2. The primary efficacy per-protocol set comprised patients who were randomized to stage 2 and had no major protocol deviations.

The secondary non-inferiority efficacy analysis was conducted on the PPS and the FAS using an analysis of covariance and the last observation carried forward approach of missing data imputation, with the baseline serum phosphorus concentration, dialysis modality (HD or PD), and geographical regions (USA, Europe, and other countries) as covariates. The primary efficacy analysis was also assessed using an analysis of covariance, with week 24 serum phosphorus concentration and region as covariates for the primary efficacy set and primary efficacy per-protocol set. Analysis of covariance for the primary efficacy end point used the last observation carried forward approach. In addition, other covariates such as sex, age, race, were considered.

### A phase III study of the efficacy and safety of a novel iron-based phosphate binder in dialysis patients [^115WwiQA]. Kidney International (2014). Low credibility.

Hyperphosphatemia is an almost inevitable consequence of chronic kidney disease, particularly in its advanced stages. In chronic kidney disease patients, the inability to maintain phosphorus balance is central to the development of chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder and is associated with increased cardiovascular events and increased mortality. Most patients on dialysis require phosphate binders to control hyperphosphatemia. Treatment with phosphate binders has been associated with a survival benefit. However, most phosphate binders are associated with a high pill burden, posing a major obstacle to adherence for patients attempting to maintain optimal control of serum phosphorus concentrations.

A phosphate binder with a low pill burden and good tolerability may improve adherence and could thereby help optimize serum phosphorus control in patients on dialysis. PA21 (sucroferric oxyhydroxide) is a new calcium-free polynuclear iron(III)-oxyhydroxide phosphate binder with a high phosphate binding capacity over a wide pH range. It is formulated as flavored, chewable tablets that disintegrate easily in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, bind phosphate across the whole physiologically relevant pH range, each containing 500 mg of iron, and may be taken without water.

Phase I studies demonstrated that PA21 was well tolerated and that GI iron absorption was minimal. A phase II dose-finding study demonstrated that PA21 doses of 1.0−2.5 g per day (based on iron content) were well tolerated and significantly lowered serum phosphorus concentrations from baseline.

### The effect of sevelamer carbonate and lanthanum carbonate on the pharmacokinetics of oral calcitriol [^115wuTzf]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2011). Low credibility.

Phosphate binders are often used to sequester dietary phosphate in the gastrointestinal tract, thereby reducing phosphate absorption and helping to manage hyperphosphataemia in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Several binders are currently available; among these, non-calcium-based lanthanum carbonate (FOSRENOL®, Shire Pharmaceuticals, Basingstoke, UK) and sevelamer (Renagel® and Renvela®, Genzyme Corporation, Cambridge, MA, USA) have been shown to be effective in reducing serum phosphorus levels in patients with CKD on dialysis and may improve survival, in comparison with calcium-based binders, in patients over 65 years of age. These non-calcium-based binders have been developed as an alternative to the older calcium-based agents, which may increase the progression of calcification.

The mechanism of action of all phosphate binders involves direct physical binding of phosphate in the contents of the gastrointestinal tract. In addition to binding phosphate, sevelamer has a high affinity for bile salts. Indeed, it has been shown in vitro that bile salts displace phosphate from sevelamer, but not from lanthanum. As sevelamer binds bile salts, it may impair the absorption of fat-soluble molecules, such as vitamin D. Sevelamer hydrochloride has been shown to reduce the bioavailability of calcitriol in beagle dogs, but no specific calcitriol interaction studies have been reported in humans. Sevelamer carbonate is a new formulation of sevelamer, which may also reduce the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins.

At the time of writing, there are no published clinical data in humans regarding the effect of sevel…

### A phase 3 study of the efficacy and safety of a novel iron-based phosphate binder in dialysis patients [^1143NEXH]. Kidney International (2014). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

- **Study design**: This was a multicenter, open-label, two-stage, prospective, randomized, parallel-group, active-controlled study of PA21 compared with SEV, conducted in 174 sites across Europe, the United States, Russia, Ukraine, and South Africa.

There were two major efficacy objectives: to investigate the non-inferiority of PA21 versus SEV, and superiority of the PA21 MD versus LD. Stage 1 (baseline to week 24) evaluated changes in serum phosphorus from baseline in the PA21 and SEV treatment groups. The efficacy objective was to demonstrate non-inferiority of PA21 versus SEV at week 12. Stage 2 (weeks 24–27) was an open-label, 3-week comparison of PA21 MD versus LD control (fixed dose of 250 mg per day), performed only in HD patients previously treated with PA21. The efficacy objective in stage 2 was to demonstrate the superiority of PA21 MD versus LD.

The protocol was reviewed by Independent Ethics Committees or Institutional Review Boards and the study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki principles, the International Conference on Harmonisation E6 Guideline for Good Clinical Practice, Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products guideline (CPMP/ICH/135/95). It was compliant with the European Union Clinical Trial Directive (Directive 2001/20/EC) and the Code of Federal Regulations for informed consent and protection of patient rights. The study is registered as NCT01324128.

### A phase 1/2, dose-escalation trial of deferasirox for the treatment of iron overload in HFE-related hereditary hemochromatosis [^117XjRt6]. Hepatology (2010). Low credibility.

Assessments

The primary objective of the core study was to assess the safety of deferasirox therapy, with continued assessment in the 24-week extension phase. Safety assessments consisted of monitoring and recording all adverse events (AEs), including serious AEs, along with regular monitoring of biochemistry, hematology, urinalysis, electrocardiogram, audiometry, and ocular examination data. The effect of deferasirox therapy on serum ferritin levels was assessed as a secondary objective. If serum ferritin levels fell to 300 ng/mL, serum ferritin, serum iron, serum transferrin, calculated total iron-binding capacity, and transferrin saturation parameters were measured at screening and at each study visit.

Statistical methods

All patients who received at least one dose of the study drug and had at least one post-baseline safety assessment were included in the safety population. The per-protocol population comprised patients from the safety population who had no major protocol violations and was used for selected efficacy analyses. The median decrease in serum ferritin levels in the core and extension studies was analyzed based on the signed-rank test for the three respective dose cohorts. Changes in serum ferritin levels among the three dose cohorts from baseline to the end of the study were evaluated by performing an analysis of covariance, where the baseline serum ferritin measure was fitted as a continuous covariate. A longitudinal analysis was also performed using a linear mixed-effects model for serum ferritin.
