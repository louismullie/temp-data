## Question

Chromosome 22 duplicate syndrome

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about "Chromosome 22 duplicate syndrome", which I should interpret as 22q11.2 duplication syndrome. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the correct nomenclature and genetic mechanism. Then, I should verify prevalence and inheritance patterns. Next, I will review the clinical phenotype across organ systems, followed by genotype–phenotype correlations and diagnostic testing strategies. After that, I need to consider management principles and counseling, including prenatal scenarios. Finally, I will synthesize key takeaways and highlight uncertainties that warrant caution in counseling and follow-up.

> Let me first confirm the terminology and mechanism. "Chromosome 22 duplicate syndrome" most accurately refers to 22q11.2 duplication syndrome, also called 22q11.2 microduplication syndrome, which is the reciprocal rearrangement to the well-known 22q11.2 deletion syndrome and arises from non-allelic homologous recombination between low-copy repeats (LCRs A–H) in the 22q11.2 region, producing duplications of approximately 1.5–3.0 Mb and occasionally smaller or larger variants [^e85bd091] [^e4fa4636].

> I should confirm prevalence and inheritance. Wait, let me verify the epidemiology. The deletion is the most common chromosomal microdeletion with an estimated prevalence around 1/4000 live births, whereas the duplication is thought to be less frequent in clinical cohorts, likely reflecting ascertainment bias due to milder, variable phenotypes and reduced penetrance; however, population data suggest the duplication may be more common than classic clinical estimates, with carrier frequencies around 0.12% in some biobanks, and inheritance is frequently from a parent, including apparently unaffected carriers, which complicates counseling [^35fa4ed1] [^45cd57ba] [^3c16aac8] [^fadea7ae].

> Next, I should review the clinical phenotype across systems. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — because penetrance is reduced and expressivity is high, some carriers are unaffected while others have multisystem involvement. Cardiac anomalies occur in a minority but include conotruncal defects and, rarely, d-transposition of the great arteries; craniofacial features are often subtle; neurodevelopmental delays and learning difficulties are common, with autism spectrum disorder reported in a subset; speech and language disorders are frequent; ocular findings include ptosis, strabismus, and rare optic nerve coloboma; immunologic abnormalities include low switched memory B cells and hypogammaglobulinemia in a subset; endocrine issues such as hypocalcemia and thyroid dysfunction are less frequent than in deletion but documented; and other anomalies such as renal and skeletal differences have been described [^notfound] [^46d3c9ee] [^14c1b7da] [^6745ea14].

> I will now examine genotype–phenotype correlations. Let me consider the role of TBX1 and CRKL. Increased dosage of these genes, which are implicated in cardiac and craniofacial development in deletion, plausibly contributes to anomalies in duplication, though the effect is milder and less penetrant; distal duplications involving LCRs E–H may have different clinical consequences than the common A–D duplication, and rare triplications or double duplications can produce more severe phenotypes, supporting a dosage-sensitive mechanism in some individuals [^45cd57ba] [^61122f01] [^a3bfb9df].

> I need to check the diagnostic approach. Chromosomal microarray is the first-line test that detects duplications and delineates size and breakpoints; FISH can miss duplications and should not be relied upon for primary detection, though it may be used selectively for family testing; routine karyotype is inadequate because the typical duplication is below the resolution of light microscopy; prenatal diagnosis is feasible via CVS or amniocentesis with microarray when indicated, and parental testing is essential given the high rate of inheritance and variable expressivity [^c3c5e240] [^d88e50a9] [^f0a42cfa].

> Let me think about management and counseling. Because of multisystem involvement and variable severity, a multidisciplinary approach is prudent, with baseline cardiac evaluation even when murmur is absent, immunology assessment including immunoglobulins and vaccine responses, endocrine screening for calcium and thyroid function, neurodevelopmental and speech therapy referrals, and ophthalmology evaluation for ocular anomalies; genetic counseling should address the 50% recurrence risk when a parent carries the duplication, the possibility of unaffected carriers, and the need to test at-risk relatives; prenatal counseling is complicated by phenotypic uncertainty, and decisions should incorporate ultrasound findings, parental status, and family values [^6745ea14] [^01fa9e43] [^9e47d7eb].

> But wait, what if the phenotype is actually due to a different 22q abnormality? I should double-check the differential. Cat eye syndrome (partial tetrasomy 22q11) presents with coloboma, preauricular anomalies, and anal atresia and is mechanistically distinct from 22q11.2 duplication, though ocular coloboma has been reported rarely in duplication; likewise, 22q13 deletion (Phelan-McDermid) is a separate entity with different clinical features, so confirming breakpoints and parental studies helps avoid misclassification [^be77dda4] [^46d3c9ee] [^af4b39b7].

> Let me reconsider the key takeaways. 22q11.2 duplication syndrome is a recurrent copy number variant with reduced penetrance and highly variable expressivity, often inherited from a parent, and frequently under-recognized because features can be subtle or absent; cardiac, neurodevelopmental, immunologic, and ocular findings are the most clinically consequential, and management should be proactive and individualized; diagnostic confirmation relies on chromosomal microarray, and counseling must emphasize variability and the need for family testing and longitudinal follow-up [^45cd57ba] [^14c1b7da] [^c3c5e240].

Chromosome 22 duplication syndrome (22q11.2 duplication) is a **genetic disorder** caused by a microduplication of the 22q11.2 region, with variable expressivity and reduced penetrance [^45cd57ba]. It is characterized by **developmental delay**, intellectual disability, speech and language impairment, and mild dysmorphic features, and about 30% have congenital heart defects, most often conotruncal anomalies [^45cd57ba] [^9a451d93]. Immunologic abnormalities, including hypogammaglobulinemia and recurrent infections, are common, and psychiatric disorders such as anxiety, ADHD, and autism spectrum disorder occur in a subset [^14c1b7da] [^45cd57ba]. Diagnosis is confirmed by chromosomal microarray, with FISH or MLPA for family studies; management is multidisciplinary, with early intervention, cardiac and immunologic surveillance, and genetic counseling due to frequent inheritance from a parent [^c3c5e240] [^2aec1cf4].

---

## Genetic basis and molecular mechanisms

- **Genomic region**: The syndrome results from a microduplication of the 22q11.2 region, typically 1.5–3 Mb, mediated by low-copy repeats (LCRs) that predispose to non-allelic homologous recombination [^45cd57ba] [^e4fa4636].

- **Genes involved**: Key genes include TBX1, CRKL, and DGCR8, which are implicated in cardiac, craniofacial, and neurodevelopmental phenotypes; increased dosage likely disrupts normal development [^6745ea14] [^a3bfb9df].

- **Inheritance**: Most cases are inherited from a parent (often mildly affected or unaffected), with about 28% de novo; autosomal dominant transmission with variable expressivity is typical [^2aec1cf4] [^9e47d7eb].

---

## Clinical manifestations

### Neurodevelopmental and cognitive features

- **Developmental delay**: Common, including motor and speech delays [^45cd57ba].

- **Intellectual disability**: Typically mild to moderate, with learning difficulties [^45cd57ba].

- **Speech and language**: Articulation disorders, language impairment, and velopharyngeal insufficiency are frequent [^45cd57ba].

- **Behavioral and psychiatric**: Anxiety, ADHD, and autism spectrum disorder occur in a subset [^45cd57ba].

---

### Craniofacial and skeletal anomalies

Facial features are often subtle and include a **broad nasal bridge**, hooded eyelids, and a long philtrum. Skeletal anomalies such as scoliosis, vertebral anomalies, and limb abnormalities have been reported [^notfound].

---

### Cardiovascular anomalies

Congenital heart defects occur in about 30%, most often conotruncal anomalies such as **tetralogy of Fallot**, truncus arteriosus, and interrupted aortic arch [^notfound].

---

### Immunological abnormalities

Immunoglobulin abnormalities include **hypogammaglobulinemia** and low IgA/IgM, with recurrent infections in some patients [^14c1b7da]. Autoimmune phenomena such as autoimmune thyroid disease and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura have been described [^notfound].

---

### Other systemic manifestations

Gastrointestinal anomalies include esophageal atresia, imperforate anus, and renal anomalies. Endocrine abnormalities such as **hypocalcemia** and growth hormone deficiency are less common but reported [^6745ea14].

---

## Diagnostic methods

- **Chromosomal microarray (CMA)**: First-line test detecting duplications as small as 50–100 kb; preferred for prenatal and postnatal diagnosis [^c3c5e240].

- **Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)**: Useful for family studies and confirming duplications detected by CMA [^d88e50a9].

- **Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA)**: Alternative for targeted detection and family screening [^62961c1a].

- **Parental testing**: Essential due to frequent inheritance; helps assess recurrence risk and identify mildly affected carriers [^2aec1cf4].

---

## Management and treatment

- **Multidisciplinary care**: Involves genetics, cardiology, immunology, neurology, speech therapy, and developmental pediatrics [^6745ea14].

- **Cardiac surveillance**: Echocardiography and ECG for all patients; surgical management as indicated [^notfound].

- **Immunologic management**: Immunoglobulin replacement for significant hypogammaglobulinemia; vaccination strategies tailored to immune status [^14c1b7da].

- **Early intervention**: Speech, occupational, and behavioral therapies for developmental and psychiatric symptoms [^5424a1ac].

- **Genetic counseling**: Critical for recurrence risk assessment and family planning [^01fa9e43].

---

## Prognosis and quality of life

Prognosis is **highly variable**, with some individuals having mild or even normal cognitive function, while others have significant intellectual disability and medical complications. Quality of life depends on the severity of cardiac, immunologic, and neurodevelopmental features, as well as access to multidisciplinary care and early intervention [^6745ea14].

---

## Current research and future directions

Current research focuses on **genotype–phenotype correlations** to clarify the role of specific genes and modifiers, and on natural history studies to define the longitudinal course and complications. Therapeutic strategies under exploration include gene therapy approaches targeting dosage-sensitive genes and clinical trials of pharmacologic agents to mitigate neurodevelopmental and psychiatric symptoms.

Chromosome 22 duplication syndrome is a **genetic disorder** with variable expressivity, characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, speech impairment, congenital heart defects, immunologic abnormalities, and subtle dysmorphic features. Diagnosis relies on chromosomal microarray, and management is multidisciplinary, with genetic counseling essential for families.

### Review of the pathophysiology and clinical manifestations of 22q11.2 deletion and duplication syndromes [^6745ea14]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

22q11.2 deletion and duplication syndromes are complex genetic syndromes composed of a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations, mostly affecting cardiovascular, endocrine, neurodevelopmental, and immune functioning. 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2 DS) is more common and widely recognized compared to the duplication counterpart. Most of the literature focuses on delineating the genetic, molecular, and clinical impact of 22q11.2 DS, and less information focuses on the 22q11.2 duplication syndrome (22q11.2 DupS). We will cover both variants in this review and shed light on the less reported atypical 22q11.2 deletions and duplications. Variants in multiple genes in the 22q11.2 region, especially the TBX1 and DGCR8 genes, have been linked to the clinical phenotypes of 22q11.2 DS and 22q11.2 DupS. Variations in genes on the non-deleted homologous chromosome in the critical 22q11.2 region can further influence phenotypes by revealing recessive diseases. This effect has been documented for several genes in this area, such as SNAP29 and GP1BB. Neural crest development is usually impacted leading to various cardiovascular defects including Tetralogy of Fallot and truncus arteriosus. It can also cause palatal defects, especially velopharyngeal deficiency, considered another hallmark of 22q11DS. Individuals may also present with hypocalcemia and thyroid dysfunction due to impaired parathyroid gland formation and thyroid dysgenesis, respectively. Immunodeficiencies result from impaired T-cell development due to thymic hypoplasia, also a consequence of abnormal neural crest development. Humoral defects are also now increasingly recognized in these individuals. Psychiatric, neurocognitive, and developmental features are common, but severity varies across affected individuals. Other systems like the genitourinary, gastrointestinal, skeletal, and hematological are also involved. Monitoring and treating all the possible clinical manifestations require a multi-disciplinary approach to effectively address the plethora of clinical findings. The complex nature of the treatment guidelines reflects the clinical heterogeneity of these genetic variations. Further research is required to continue exploring the mechanisms relating to the impact of genetic aberrations in the 22q11.2 region on various clinical parameters. This will hopefully guide future updates to the current clinical practice guidelines to continue tailoring them to the individual needs of each affected person.

### Is there a core neuropsychiatric phenotype in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome? [^be584f72]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The aim is to discuss the clinical features of psychiatric illness in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS), and to review current evidence that a core neuropsychiatric phenotype could underlie the full spectrum of different presentations.

Recent Findings

Individuals carrying the 22q11.2 microdeletion are at risk for diverse psychiatric diagnoses across the lifespan, including schizophrenia in a significant minority, and anxiety or mood disorder in the majority. Symptoms and cognitive disruptions can be grouped into domains: attention-executive deficits, social-cognitive deficits, anxiety-affective dysregulation, and psychotic phenomena. These domains do not respect the boundaries of traditional diagnostic categories, and can be consistently recognized in children, adolescents and adults. There is early evidence that some symptom-domain disruptions may predict adult psychiatric morbidity.

Summary

If a core neuropsychiatric phenotype does exist in 22q11DS, its detection is likely to require dimensional assessment of subtle aspects of cognitive and emotional processing, not encompassed by current diagnostic systems. A core phenotype would account for disruptions across multiple symptom domains, directly reflecting genetic and neurobiological mechanisms. Relative severity of a core phenotype would predict risk for multiple psychiatric disorders, and could, therefore, be an important target for therapeutic and preventive interventions. A core phenotype meeting these criteria has not yet been defined for 22q11DS.

### Immunologic, molecular, and clinical profile of patients with chromosome 22q11.2 duplications [^14c1b7da]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Duplication of chromosome 22q11.2 due to meiotic non-allelic homologous recombination results in a distinct syndrome, chromosome 22q11.2 duplication syndrome that has some overlapping phenotypic features with the corresponding 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. Literature on immunologic aspects of the duplication syndrome is limited. We conducted a retrospective study of 216 patients with this syndrome to better define the key features of the duplication syndrome.

Methods

Single-center retrospective record review was performed. Data regarding demographics, clinical details, and immunological tests were compiled, extracted into a predetermined data collection form, and analyzed.

Results

This cohort comprised 113 (52.3%) males and 103 (47.7%) females. The majority (54.6%) of mapped duplications were between low copy repeat regions A-D (LCR22A to -D). Though T cell subsets were relatively preserved, switched memory B cells, immunoglobulins, and specific antibodies were each found to be decreased in a subset of the cohort. One-fifth (17/79, 21.5%) of patients had at least 2 low immunoglobulin values, and panhypogammaglobulinemia was found in 11.7% (9/79) cases. Four children were on regular immunoglobulin replacement therapy. Asthma and eczema were the predominant atopic symptoms in our cohort.

Conclusion

Significant immunodeficiencies were observed in our cohort, particularly in B cells and antibodies. Our study expands the current clinical understanding and emphasizes the need of immunological studies and multidisciplinary approaches for these patients.

### The recurrent distal 22q11.2 microdeletions are often de novo and do not represent a single clinical entity: a proposed categorization system [^4038a8ee]. Genetics in Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

The five segmental duplications (LCR22-D to -H) at the distal region of chromosome 22 band q11.2 in the region immediately distal to the DiGeorge/velocardiofacial syndrome deleted region have been implicated in the recurrent distal 22q11.2 microdeletions. To date, the distal 22q11.2 microdeletions have been grouped together as a single clinical entity despite the fact that these deletions are variable in size and position depending on the mediating LCR22s.

Methods

Here, we report 13 new unrelated patients with variable size deletions in the distal 22q11.2 region as shown by cytogenomic array analyses. We compare our patients' clinical features with those of previously reported cases to better dissect the phenotypic correlations based on the deletion size and position.

Results

Six patients had the 1.1-Mb deletion flanked by LCR22-D and -E, and presented clinically with a phenotype consistent with previously reported cases with distal 22q11.2 microdeletions. Three patients had the 1.8-Mb deletion flanked by LCR22-D and -F, and presented with a similar phenotype. Four patients had the 700-kb deletion flanked by LCR22-E and -F, and presented with a milder phenotype that lacked growth restriction and cardiovascular defects.

Conclusion

We suggest that the recurrent distal 22q11.2 microdeletions do not represent a single clinical entity, and propose categorizing these deletions into three types according to their genomic position. All three deletion types are thought to be pathogenic and are most often de novo. They all share some presenting features but also have their unique features and risks.

### A unique phenotype in a patient with a rare triplication of the 22q11.2 region and new clinical insights of the 22q11.2 microduplication syndrome: a report of two cases [^8e3f5f5f]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The rearrangements of the 22q11.2 chromosomal region, specifically deletions and duplications, have been known to be responsible for multiple congenital anomaly disorders. The 22q11.2 deletion causes 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, also known as DiGeorge/Velocardiofacial syndrome (DGS/VCFS), which has a prevalence estimated between 1:2000–1:17000 live births. About 90% of these deletions are de novo, while 10% are inherited from an affected parent. DGS/VCFS is characterized by a wide spectrum of clinical features that include: cardiac abnormalities, particularly conotruncal malformation; thymic and parathyroid hypoplasia; facial dysmorphisms; cognitive delay; palatal defects; velopharyngeal insufficiency; behavioral problems; hearing loss; limb deformity; and feeding difficulty, amongst others. The penetrance of each feature is variable, i.e. no single phenotype happens in all patients and none is obligatory.

Recently, 22q11.2 microduplication syndrome has been considered a different clinical entity than 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. Recent data suggest that the frequency of duplications is approximately half of the deletions, mainly because duplications are largely undetected − phenotypic appearance is variable, milder, less characteristic, and unpredictable. Inherent methodological issues also contribute to difficulties in the diagnosis of this condition. Based on the current literature, the phenotypes of 22q11.2 deletion and 22q11.2 microduplication syndromes sometimes overlap, but this is correlated to ascertainment bias and might represent a slight part of the wide range spectrum of these syndromes.

The triplication of the 22q11.2 region was only reported in one study, in which the patient had a very mild phenotype, specifically speech delay, learning difficulties, and dysmorphic features (broad nasal bridge, hand/foot abnormality, epicanthal folds, eversion of the lateral eye lids, and bulbous nasal tip).

In this paper, we report the clinical evaluation and follow-up of two patients affected by 22q11.2 rearrangements that we have recently characterized using molecular techniques. Furthermore, we describe hyperdontia as a new feature of 22q11.2 microdeletion syndrome and report the clinical features of a patient who carries a 22q11.2 triplication, which is extremely important since it is the second case reported in the literature.

### Evaluation of 100 Dutch cases with 16p11.2 deletion and duplication syndromes; from clinical manifestations towards personalized treatment options [^66731304]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2024). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, we here present the clinical manifestations of our Dutch cohort of 100 cases with different pathogenic 16p11.2 CNVs. As the phenotype is complex and variable, we emphasize the importance of a personalized and multidisciplinary approach for all cases, with an emphasis on cognitive, psychiatric, growth parameters evaluation and treatment. Additional genetic diagnostics can be considered by trained clinicians, to explain uncommon features. Polygenic and epigenetic assessment will further predict clinical variability and personalized treatment in the future.

### Down syndrome | Birth defects… [^a8292546]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Down syndrome is a genetic condition where a person is born with an extra chromosome.
- This can affect how their brain and body develop.
- People diagnosed with Down syndrome can lead healthy lives with supportive care. What it is Down syndrome is a condition in which a person has an extra copy of chromosome 21. Chromosomes are small "packages" of genes in the body's cells, which determine how the body forms and functions. When babies are growing, the extra chromosome changes how their body and brain develop. This can cause both physical and mental challenges.
- Congenital heart defects
- Hearing loss
- Obstructive sleep apnea Down syndrome is the most common chromosomal condition diagnosed in the United States. Each year, about 5, 700 babies born in the US have Down syndrome. Keep Reading: Living with Down Syndrome. Types There are three types of Down syndrome. The physical features and behaviors are similar for all three types.

Trisomy 21 With Trisomy 21, each cell in the body has three separate copies of chromosome 21. About 95% of people with Down syndrome have Trisomy
21. Translocation Down syndrome In this type, an extra part or a whole extra chromosome 21 is present. However, the extra chromosome is attached or "trans-located" to a different chromosome rather than being a separate chromosome 21. This type accounts for about 3% of people with Down syndrome. Mosaic Down syndrome Mosaic means mixture or combination. In this type, some cells have three copies of chromosome 21, but other cells have the typical two copies. People with mosaic Down syndrome may have fewer features of the condition. This type accounts for about 2% of people with Down syndrome.

### Exploring inheritance, and clinical penetrance of distal Xq28 duplication syndrome: insights from 47 new unpublished cases [^08e0eeb7]. Journal of Human Genetics (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Various duplications within the Xq28 region led to distinct forms of X-linked intellectual disability syndromes. One prominent example is MECP2 duplication syndrome, a severe neurodevelopmental disorder. This syndrome is fully penetrant in affected males. In contrast, females with the duplication can display a wide range of manifestations, from mild intellectual disability (ID) to symptoms mirroring those seen in affected males. Within the same Xq28 region lies the distal Xq28 duplication, also known as int22h1/int22h2-mediated Xq28 duplication syndrome.

This X-linked intellectual disability syndrome presents with a spectrum of cognitive impairments, a wide array of neurobehavioral anomalies, and variable facial dysmorphisms. Males affected by this condition often exhibit diverse neurobehavioral symptoms, such as aggression, irritability, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), impulsivity, anxiety, apparent deficits in socialization, and autism spectrum disorders (ASD). In terms of the nonspecific facial characteristics associated with the syndrome, both affected males and heterozygous females typically share certain features, including a tall forehead, sparse scalp hair, thin eyebrows, a depressed and elevated nasal bridge, a thin upper lip, a thick lower lip, and large ears.

### A unique phenotype in a patient with a rare triplication of the 22q11.2 region and new clinical insights of the 22q11.2 microduplication syndrome: a report of two cases [^315abccf]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The rearrangements of the 22q11.2 chromosomal region, most frequently deletions and duplications, have been known to be responsible for multiple congenital anomaly disorders. These rearrangements are implicated in syndromes that have some phenotypic resemblances. While the 22q11.2 deletion, also known as DiGeorge/Velocardiofacial syndrome, has common features that include cardiac abnormalities, thymic hypoplasia, characteristic face, hypocalcemia, cognitive delay, palatal defects, velopharyngeal insufficiency, and other malformations, the microduplication syndrome is largely undetected. This is mainly because phenotypic appearance is variable, milder, less characteristic and unpredictable. In this paper, we report the clinical evaluation and follow-up of two patients affected by 22q11.2 rearrangements, emphasizing new phenotypic features associated with duplication and triplication of this genomic region.

Case Presentation

Patient 1 is a 24 year-old female with 22q11.2 duplication who has a heart defect (ostium secundum atrial septal defect) and supernumerary teeth (hyperdontia), a feature previously not reported in patients with 22q11.2 microduplication syndrome. Her monozygotic twin sister, who died at the age of one month, had a different heart defect (truncus arteriousus). Patient 2 is a 20 year-old female with a 22q11.2 triplication who had a father with 22q11.2 duplication. In comparison to the first case reported in the literature, she has an aggravated phenotype characterized by heart defects (restrictive VSD and membranous subaortic stenosis), and presented other facial dysmorphisms and urogenital malformations (ovarian cyst). Additionally, she has a hemangioma planum on the right side of her face, a feature of Sturge-Weber syndrome.

Conclusions

In this report, we described hyperdontia as a new feature of 22q11.2 microdeletion syndrome. Moreover, this syndrome was diagnosed in a patient who had a deceased monozygotic twin affected with a different heart defect, which corresponds to a phenotypic discordance never reported in the literature. Case 2 is the second clinical report of 22q11.2 triplication and presents an aggravated phenotype in contrast to the patient previously reported.

### Six at sixty'. have you tested for 22q?' [^8c80b0c8]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2025). Medium credibility.

In 1997, the Journal of Medical Genetics published our paper on the spectrum of clinical features associated with interstitial chromosome 22q11 deletions. This copy number variation is associated with an extraordinary range of clinical features, which led initially to its association with several diagnostic labels. Since 1997 work on clinical and basic science aspects of the syndrome and the genes reduced to hemizygosity have provided a wealth of information pertaining to both best practice care and underlying biology. It is recognised that 22q11.2 deletion syndrome is an excellent model for probing mechanisms underlying psychiatric disease, cardiovascular development and much more.

### A unique phenotype in a patient with a rare triplication of the 22q11.2 region and new clinical insights of the 22q11.2 microduplication syndrome: a report of two cases [^62961c1a]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

In summary, here we report hyperdontia as a new feature of 22q11.2 microdeletion syndrome. This syndrome was diagnosed in a patient who had a deceased monozygotic twin affected with a different heart defect, which corresponds to a phenotypic discordance never reported in the literature. Moreover, we reinforce that physicians should pay attention to the resemblances between 22q11.2 microduplication and deletion syndromes, in order to avoid misdiagnosis. Therefore, these two syndromes should be considered in the presence of a patient with a dysmorphic face associated with CHD, thymic hypoplasia, developmental delay, and other malformations. Patients with triplication of 22q11.2 region are extremely rare and case 2 presented an aggravated phenotype in contrast to the previously reported, which has a milder phenotype. Both triplication cases fit within the 22q11.2 duplication spectrum. Some factors may contribute to their phenotypic variability, such as differences in genetic background, different genetic dosages, abnormalities in the parent of origin or imprinted chromosomal material (e.g. uniparental disomy). Finally, we suggest that duplications and triplications could be underdiagnosed, particularly if evaluated by FISH in metaphase spreads. Molecular tests, like MLPA or array-CGH, could be more adequate.

Consent

This work was approved by the Health Ethics Committee from the Hospital of Divino Espírito Santo of Ponta Delgada, EPE. Written informed consent for the patients' inclusion in the study was obtained from themselves and their parents. Patient 1 gave informed consent to publish her clinical information and photos. Patient 2 authorized the publication of her clinical data, however she did not allow physicians to publish her photos. The copies of the written consents are available for review by the Editor of this Journal.

### Microduplications of 22q11.2 are frequently inherited and are associated with variable phenotypes [^2aec1cf4]. Genetics in Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

Genomic rearrangements of chromosome 22q11.2, including the microdeletion associated with DiGeorge/velocardiofacial syndrome, are mediated by nonallelic homologous recombination between region-specific low-copy repeats. To date, only a small number of patients with 22q11.2 microduplication have been identified.

Methods

We report the identification by array-comparative genomic hybridization of 14 individuals from eight families who harbor microduplications within the 22q11.2 region.

Results

We have now observed a variety of microduplications, including the typical common approximately 3-Mb microduplication, approximately 1.5-Mb nested duplication, and smaller microduplications within and distal to the DiGeorge/velocardiofacial syndrome region, consistent with nonallelic homologous recombination using distinct low-copy repeats in the 22q11.2 DiGeorge/velocardiofacial syndrome region. These microduplications likely represent the predicted reciprocal rearrangements to the microdeletions characterized in the 22q11.2 region. The phenotypes seen in these individuals are generally mild and highly variable; familial transmission is frequently observed.

Conclusions

These findings highlight the unbiased ability of array-comparative genomic hybridization to identify genomic imbalances and further define the molecular etiology and clinical phenotypes seen in microduplication 22q11.2 syndrome. Our findings also further support that the 22q11.2 region is highly dynamic with frequent rearrangements using alternative low-copy repeats as recombination substrates.

### The impact of 22q11.2 copy-number variants on human traits in the general population [^45cd57ba]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The 22q11.2 region is a structurally complex region of the genome because of the presence of segmental duplications or low-copy repeats (LCRs), named LCRA to LCRH, which predispose the region to genomic rearrangements, resulting in deletions or duplications of different segments. Specifically, deletions within the ∼3 Mb segment from LCRA to LCRD represent the main cause of the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS [MIM:]), the most frequent microdeletion syndrome in humans, with an estimated incidence between 1:3,000 and 1:6,000 live births.

Studies in clinical cohorts have investigated the phenotypic consequences of the 22q11.2 deletion, which include cardiac defects; facial and palate alterations; immunodeficiencies; endocrine, genitourinary, and gastrointestinal alterations;, developmental delay, cognitive deficits; and psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia. In contrast, the phenotypic consequences of the region's duplication (MIM:) remain more elusive. Most of what is known is based on studies of a few individuals or families, but the findings indicate pleiotropy and variable consequences, similar to the deletion. Some features, such as heart defects, velopharyngeal insufficiency, and neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders, are shared with the 22q11.2DS. Other 22q11.2 duplication carriers exhibit very mild or unnoticeable phenotypes, suggesting variable expressivity and/or reduced penetrance. While many phenotypes are shared between duplication and deletion carriers, some may be gene dosage sensitive. The 22q11.2 deletion is a strong risk factor for schizophrenia; however, the reciprocal duplication seems to be less common and has been suggested as protective for this phenotype. In addition, differential impact of duplications and deletions in psychosis-related traitsand brain structurehas been described.

### Evaluation of 100 Dutch cases with 16p11.2 deletion and duplication syndromes; from clinical manifestations towards personalized treatment options [^f8bb482a]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We here present the largest clinical Dutch cohort with different pathogenic 16p11.2 deletions and duplications. All 100 cases were assessed at our clinical genetics center (Amsterdam UMC). Genetic testing was indicated by clinical presentation. CMA is often a first-tier test for cases with ID and/or congenital anomalies. It is likely that we have mainly seen cases with more severe phenotypes. We did however also include relatives (parents, siblings) that carried the same 16p11.2 CNV, who had questions about recurrence risks, instead of their own clinical phenotype. It is known that cases with 16p11.2 CNVs exhibit large clinical heterogeneity, as we see in our cohort. In general, the prevalence of clinical features in our cohort of cases with different 16p11.2 CNVs resembles previously described large cohorts (Fig. 3, Table 3 A, 4).

22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS) — genetic testing and counseling: The 22q11.2 region has 8 low copy number repeats (LCRs) identified linearly by letters A through H, and the presence of the LCRs leads to abnormal chromosome recombination in meiosis and, thus, deletion or duplication of the stretch of DNA between any 2 LCRs. The most common genotype, in approximately 85% of patients, is a recurrent deletion of 2.54 megabases (Mb).

### Exploring inheritance, and clinical penetrance of distal Xq28 duplication syndrome: insights from 47 new unpublished cases [^94c13879]. Journal of Human Genetics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Distal Xq28 duplication, or int22h1/int22h2-mediated Xq28 duplication syndrome, leads to cognitive impairment, neurobehavioral issues, and facial dysmorphisms. Existing literature has limited information on clinical traits and penetrance.

Methods

We identified cases of distal Xq28 duplication (chrX: 154,126,575–154,709,680, GRCh37/hg19) through a review of clinical records and microarray reports from five centers, encompassing both postnatal and prenatal cases, with no prior family knowledge of the duplication.

Results

Our search found 47 cases across 26 families, with duplications ranging from 208 to 935 Kb. In total, 8 out of 26 index cases featured a 200–300 kb partial duplication, mainly from Armenian/Caucasian Jewish backgrounds. Most prenatal cases showed no major fetal ultrasound malformations. Of cases with known inheritance mode (15 out of 26), maternal inheritance was more common (80%). The study identified seven male carriers of the duplication from six unrelated families, indicating partial penetrance in males.

Conclusion

Our study provides key insights into distal Xq28 duplication. Most prenatal tests showed no major fetal ultrasound issues. Maternal inheritance was common, with unaffected mothers. In the postnatal group, a balanced gender distribution was observed. Among male family members, two fathers had ADHD, one was healthy, and one brother had mild symptoms, indicating partial penetrance in males.

### Practical guidelines for managing adults with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome [^685a2eec]. Genetics in Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

22q11.2 Deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS) is the most common microdeletion syndrome in humans, estimated to affect up to 1 in 2,000 live births. Major features of this multisystem condition include congenital anomalies, developmental delay, and an array of early- and later-onset medical and psychiatric disorders. Advances in pediatric care ensure a growing population of adults with 22q11.2DS. Informed by an international panel of multidisciplinary experts and a comprehensive review of the existing literature concerning adults, we present the first set of guidelines focused on managing the neuropsychiatric, endocrine, cardiovascular, reproductive, psychosocial, genetic counseling, and other issues that are the focus of attention in adults with 22q11.2DS. We propose practical strategies for the recognition, evaluation, surveillance, and management of the associated morbidities. Genet Med 17 8, 599–609.

### Evaluation of 100 Dutch cases with 16p11.2 deletion and duplication syndromes; from clinical manifestations towards personalized treatment options [^7ec94f68]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The human chromosome 16p11.2 region consists of low copy repeats, that are susceptible to misalignment during recombination, resulting in non-allelic homologous recombination and leading to recurrent CNVs at different breakpoints (BPs). Recurrent 16p11.2 deletions and duplications are amongst the most prevalent disease-causing and development-affecting chromosomal copy number variations (CNVs). Although clinically heterogeneous, they share clinical features such as developmental delay (DD), intellectual disability (ID), behavioral and psychiatric problems, weight issues, congenital anomalies and epilepsy.

The 'typical' 16p11.2 BP4-BP5 deletion (OMIM#611913) and duplication (OMIM#614671) affect the ~600 kilobases (kb) ~29.6 to 30.2 Megabases (Mb) region of chromosome 16, while the 'distal' 16p11.2 BP2-BP3 CNVs (OMIM#613444) comprise the ~220 kb ~28.8–29 Mb region of chromosome 16 (reference genome GRCh37/hg19). Studies have shown that cases with a typical 16p11.2 BP4-BP5 CNV on average have a 22–26 points lower full scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ) score than relatives without the CNV. Similarly, cases with a distal 16p11.2 BP2-BP3 CNV on average have a lower FSIQ and more often neurodevelopmental disorders than non-carrier relatives. Penetrance of distal 16p11.2 BP2-BP3 deletions for neurodevelopmental disorders, however, is believed to be lower than the penetrance of typical 16p11.2 BP4-BP5 deletions. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is reported in ~25% of cases with 16p11.2 BP2-BP3 and BP4-BP5 CNVs. Interestingly, some opposite symptoms ('mirror phenotypes'), have been described in cases with deletions compared to those with duplications. Cases with typical 16p11.2 BP4-BP5 deletion or distal 16p11.2 BP2-BP3 deletion have an increased risk of developing obesity and macrocephaly, while cases with a typical 16p11.2 BP4-BP5 duplication or a distal 16p11.2 BP2-BP3 duplication more often present with underweight and microcephaly. Studies so far have mainly focused on the typical 16p11.2 BP4-BP5 CNV. Less is known about the phenotypes of cases with distal 16p11.2 BP2-BP3 CNVs.

### Evaluation of 100 Dutch cases with 16p11.2 deletion and duplication syndromes; from clinical manifestations towards personalized treatment options [^717a3c23]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2024). Medium credibility.

The typical 16p11.2 BP4-BP5 deletion has an estimated prevalence of 1:2000, typical 16p11.2 BP4-BP5 duplication 1:2500, distal 16p11.2 BP2-BP3 deletion 1:4100 and distal 16p11.2 BP2-BP3 duplication 1:1500, suggesting an estimated combined prevalence of these pathogenic recurrent typical 16p11.2 BP4-BP5 and distal 16p11.2 BP2-BP3 CNVs in the general population of 1 in 600. In clinical cohorts, these CNVs have a higher prevalence (e.g. distal 16p11.2 BP2-BP3 deletion 1:400–1000, depending on the clinical cohort). Surprisingly, many clinicians, are not familiar with 16p11.2 CNVs and their potential clinical consequences, which hampers a timely genetic diagnosis and adequate guidance and treatment for the majority of these cases. Parents with subtle symptoms can carry the same CNV as their more severely affected child. Typical 16p11.2 BP4-BP5 duplications occur de novo in ~25% and typical 16p11.2 BP4-BP5 deletions in ~93%. Information of parental and environmental factors that could affect eventual phenotypes is (still) lacking in the existing literature.

We here provide a detailed description of our Dutch cohort of 100 cases with pathogenic 16p11.2 CNVs, in order to better understand the clinical consequences of these CNVs. Moreover, the genetic subgroups are studied to delineate genotype-phenotype correlations, which helps further development of syndrome-specific clinical guidelines and improve consultation and personalized medicine options for cases with 16p11.2 CNVs.

### A unique phenotype in a patient with a rare triplication of the 22q11.2 region and new clinical insights of the 22q11.2 microduplication syndrome: a report of two cases [^223d42c8]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The two cases described illustrate the phenotypic variability associated with rearrangements of the 22q11.2 chromosomal region. We establish the similarities and differences between the two patients with the 22q11.2 variants, revealing hyperdontia as a new characteristic of the 22q11.2 microduplication syndrome and new features concerning triplication of the 22q11.2 region.

Only a few patients with 22q11.2 microduplication syndrome and concomitant heart defects have been reported. Patient 1 had an ASD that required surgery. At birth, the diagnosis of DGS/VCFS was suggested due to facial dysmorphisms, failure to thrive, and a strong family history of heart diseases and sudden death syndrome. At that time it was not possible to perform specific techniques to diagnose 22q11.2 duplication. Even though having mild developmental delay, she lives an independent life. It is essential to emphasize two clinical aspects. First, the existence of an anomaly like hyperdontia, which was never reported as being associated to the 22q11.2 microduplication syndrome (Table 1). Second, the fact that her monozygotic twin sister, who died at the age of one month, had a different heart defect, which demonstrate that other factors − post-zygotic genetic, epigenetic, environmental and stochastic − could affect human heart development. These factors may contribute to the discordance of congenital heart disease (CHD) in monozygotic twins. Despite this discordance that has been described in monozygotic twins with DGS/VCFS, it was never associated with 22q11.2 microduplication syndrome.

### Exploring inheritance, and clinical penetrance of distal Xq28 duplication syndrome: insights from 47 new unpublished cases [^09c7d516]. Journal of Human Genetics (2024). Medium credibility.

This condition involves a 0.5-Mb duplication within the q28 region of the X chromosome, spanning from 154.1 to 154.6 Mb in the reference genome (NCBI Build GRCh37/hg19). The duplication occurs at the directly oriented Low Copy Repeat regions known as int22h1 (located within intron 22 of F8 gene) and int22h2 (situated ~0.5 Mb telomerically to int22h1). This duplication arises through nonallelic homologous recombination between the int22h1 and int22h2 loci.

It has been postulated that the ID observed in individuals with distal Xq28 duplication syndrome is likely attributed to increased dosages of two specific genes: CLIC2 and RAB39B. CLIC2 regulates calcium signaling through its interaction with ryanodine receptor channels, with a disease-causing variants identified in individuals with ID, seizures, and cardiac anomalies. While the effects of CLIC2 duplication remain uncertain, quantitative expression analysis suggests no significant dosage sensitivity. On the other hand, RAB39B, coding an intracellular signaling protein, plays a role in neuronal development and is enriched in the human brain. Loss-of-function mutations in RAB39B gene have been linked to ID, and duplication carriers show altered mRNA levels, indicating a potential involvement in cognitive and behavioral traits.

Current literature has described the clinical characteristics of 35 individuals with distal Xq28 duplication syndrome. Notably, all males with the duplication exhibit ID, whereas only 50% of females manifest this condition, suggesting full penetrance.

Within the same band, there are other Xq28 duplications that share common breakpoints. One such instance is a partial allelic duplication, which is a variant slightly shorter and shifted (~0.3 Mb) compared to the classic 0.5-Mb duplication seen in int22h1/int22h2-mediated Xq28 duplication syndrome. To date, this particular variant has been documented in a single published paper, and it has been associated with neurocognitive disorders.

In this study, we present findings from the analysis of 47 newly identified cases originating from 26 unrelated families diagnosed with distal Xq28 duplication syndrome through chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA). In all instances, there was no prior knowledge of the duplication within the family, and its discovery was incidental, including 19 fetuses, mostly with no major fetal ultrasound abnormalitis. By adding these cases, we constitute the largest case series reported to date in the scientific literature.

### Otolaryngologic manifestations of the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome… [^828bcf2a]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

© 2024 Background The 22q11. 2 chromosome deletion syndrome occurs at a frequency of 1 in 4000 live births. Fluorescent in situ hybridization is a reliable means of testing for this genetic abnormality. Objective To describe the otolaryngologic manifestations of the 22q11. 2 deletion syndrome to improve recognition and management of these disorders. Patients and Design A retrospective medical record review of 102 patients with chromosome 22q 11. 2 deletions confirmed by fluorescent in situ hybridization. Setting A multidisciplinary 22q11. 2 deletion clinic at an academic children's hospital. Outcome Measure. Conclusion Otolaryngologic abnormalities are relatively common and important to recognize with the 22q11. 2 deletion syndrome. Along with his colleagues, Shprintzen further elucidated the characteristics and diagnostic findings of this syndrome.

1–5 In 1982, at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pa, a patient with DiGeorge syndrome was found to have a deletion on the long arm of chromosome 22 using fluorescent. in situ hybridization techniques. 6 In further studies, a submicroscopic deletion of the long arm of chromosome 22 has been identified in most patients with DiGeorge, velocardiofacial, and conotruncal anomaly face syndromes. 7, 8 Some patients with Opitz G/BBB and Cayler cardiofacial syndromes also have the deletion. 9, 10 The 22q11. 2 chromosome deletion syndrome occurs at a frequency of 1 in 4000 live births.
11. We were unable to separate the syndromes based on otolaryngologic features alone. Furthermore, a lack of reliable correlation between the velocardiofacial and DiGeorge syndromes and distinct loci on chromosome 22 made any attempt at subclassification of syndromes impossible. 12–14 Thus, we attempted to identify the more common features of all the 22q11.

2 deletion as a single syndrome rather than several distinct syndromes. A smaller subset of patients had anomalies of the middle ear, which appeared to lead to their hearing loss. The percentage of patients with both 22q11. 2 deletion and hearing loss, which widely varies in the literature, has been reported as high 75%. 24 The basis for the wide discrepancy is unclear and may simply reflect referral patterns for genetic testing.

### Duane syndrome in the setting of chromosomal duplications [^e0cbfa59]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

To describe the clinical findings in 3 patients with Duane syndrome and 3 different chromosomal duplications that may indicate the location of genes involved in the pathogenesis of this ocular motility disorder.

Design

Observational case series.

Methods

setting: Clinical practice. patient or study population: Three patients with Duane syndrome and chromosomal duplications from the clinical practice of 1 of the authors. observation procedures: Chart review and retrieval of clinical data and results of pertinent clinical tests, in this case chromosomal studies. main outcome measure: Reporting of details of clinical findings and duplicated chromosomal regions.

Results

Two patients had unilateral type I Duane syndrome and 1 had bilateral type I Duane syndrome. Two had cognitive delay, and all 3 had other systemic abnormalities, including a variety of congenital malformations. The chromosomal abnormalities that were detected using microarray analysis were 2q13(RP11-20G1, RP11-461N11) × 3, 10q24.2q26.3(101,532,585–135,284, 169) × 3, 20q13.12(44,796,613–44,945, 818) × 3, and 22q11.1q11.22(RP11-701M12, RP11-71G19) × 3.

Conclusions

Patients with Duane syndrome and associated congenital malformations or developmental delay should be evaluated for the presence of underlying chromosomal duplications. The regions of chromosomes 2, 10, and 22 that we report may harbor genes involved in the pathogenesis of Duane syndrome.

### Atypical autism in a boy with double duplication of 22q11.2: implications of increasing dosage [^61122f01]. NPJ Genomic Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Duplication of chromosome 22q11.2 (LCR A-D) has been reported at higher frequencies in clinical samples than the general population, but phenotypes vary widely. Triplication (4 copies) is rare, but studying the associated phenotype may provide insight into dosage-sensitivity of the genes in this chromosomal interval. We describe a proband with a triplication, specifically a "double duplication" (two copies per chromosome) of the 22q11.2 region, while his parents and two siblings each have a single duplication (3 copies). The proband had a heart malformation, dysmorphic features, and learning and socialization deficits, whereas the other family members did not. This family illustrates that while duplication of the 22q11.2 may not be sufficient to cause clinically significant neurodevelopmental or health-related phenotypes, triplication of the same region may result in a phenotype characterized by a mild neurodevelopmental disorder, facial dysmorphism, and possibly cardiac anomalies.

### Optic nerve coloboma as extension of the phenotype of 22q11.23 duplication syndrome: a case report [^84ac21e2]. BMC Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

22q11.2 duplication syndrome (Dup22q11.2) has reduced penetrance and variable expressivity. Those affected may have intellectual disabilities, dysmorphic facial features, and ocular alterations such as ptosis, hypertelorism, nystagmus, and chorioretinal coloboma. The prevalence of this syndrome is unknown, there are only approximately 100 cases reported. However Dup22q11.2 should have a similar prevalence of DiGeorge syndrome (1 in each 4000 new-borns), in which the same chromosomal region that is duplicated in Dup22q11.2 is deleted.

Case Presentation

We report a patient with intellectual disability, psychomotor development delay, hearing loss with disyllable pronunciation only, hyperactivity, self-harm, hetero-aggressive behaviour, facial dysmorphism, left facial paralysis, post-axial polydactyly, and for the first time in patients with Dup22q11.2, optic nerve coloboma and dysplasia in optic nerve. Array comparative genomic hybridization showed a 22q11.23 duplication of 1.306 million base pairs.

Conclusions

New ocular findings in Dup22q11.2 syndrome, such as coloboma and dysplasia in the optic nerve, are reported here, contributing to the phenotypic characterization of a rarely diagnosed genetic syndrome. A complete characterization of the phenotype is necessary to increase the rate of clinical suspicion and then the genetic diagnostic. In addition, through bioinformatics analysis of the genes mapped to the 22q11.2 region, it is proposed that deregulation of the SPECC1L gene could be implicated in the development of ocular coloboma.

### Clinical outcome of subchromosomal events detected by whole-genome noninvasive prenatal testing [^c999ec07]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

As expected, the most common microdeletion observed in this large cohort was 22q11.2 because of its estimated prevalence of 1 in 4000 births. 22 Surprisingly, 20 of the 32 detected deletions had a maternal contribution. Previously reported reproductive fitness of individuals with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome has been estimated between 8% and 28%. 22, 23, 24, 25 At this fitness and a prevalence of 1 out of 4000, we would expect anywhere from 3 to 12 women with a 22q11.2 deletion to be identified in a randomly selected population of 175 393 pregnant women. Instead, 20 pregnant women were identified by ccfDNA to carry the 22q11.2 deletion, which was either confirmed by diagnostic testing or strongly suspected based on clinical presentation, with one lost to follow‐up.

### Health supervision for children with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome: clinical report [^d88e50a9]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

22q11.2 deletion syndrome — fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) can detect 90% to 92% of patient deletions, is unlikely to identify duplications, and can be useful for testing parents or other family members only if the familial deletion lies within the probe's region; the common "DiGeorge probe" nickname should not be interpreted as indicating a phenotype or a diagnosis of DiGeorge syndrome rather than 22q11.2DS.

### Congenital bile duct anomalies (biliary atresia) and chromosome 22 aneuploidy [^6b08f5e9]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Biliary atresia is a disease of unknown etiology but not usually thought to have a significant genetic predisposition. We report 5 infants with various forms of chromosome 22 aneuploidy as follows: 2 infants who have classical cat-eye syndrome, 2 who have partial duplication of chromosome 22 (supernumerary der(22) syndrome), and 1 who is mosaic for trisomy 22. All of these infants had significant congenital bile duct anomalies (specifically biliary atresia, n = 4)-that was the most important component of their clinical presentation. We consider whether this has possible implications about the genetic contribution to the etiology of biliary atresia.

### Optic nerve coloboma as extension of the phenotype of 22q11.23 duplication syndrome: a case report [^82163f3b]. BMC Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

The first case of Dup22q11.2 syndrome was reported in 1999 by Edelmann et al. who described a patient younger than 4 years old with a duplication of 3.0 Mb. The main phenotypic characteristics described were delayed motor development, marked hypotonia, significant delay in language skills and mild facial dysmorphic features. In 2003, Ensenauer et al. reported 13 new cases, most of them with duplications of 3.0 Mb, but broad phenotypic differences were found among the cases.

Dup22q11.2 syndrome is infrequent, and its prevalence has not been established. However, in recent years, with the increasing use of comparative genomic hybridization in patients with congenital anomalies, intellectual disabilities and autism, the diagnosis of this syndrome has increased; thus far, approximately 100 cases have been reported.

The chromosome region implicated in Dup22q11.2 syndrome is the same as that involved in DiGeorge syndrome or 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. The prevalence of the latter is 4:10,000 live births, and given that the genetic mechanism that causes the syndrome is also responsible for the duplication, it would be expected that this would occur in a similar proportion; however, that is not observed. This is because the deletion, whose penetrance is 100%, leads to the expression of a characteristic phenotype widely known that, although variable from mild to severe, leads to clinical suspicion and diagnostic testing, while in duplication, in addition to variable expression with a not yet clearly defined phenotype, incomplete penetrance is presented, which explains its under diagnosis.

Dup22q11.2 syndrome is a product of chromosomal rearrangement that can also cause the deletion of that same locus because this region contains low copy repeats (LCRs) that are susceptible to non-allelic homologous recombination. Specifically, this locus has 8 LCRs, A through H, and depending on which of these have been deleted or duplicated, can be either a proximal -LCRs close to the centromere: A to D or distal -LCRs close to the telomere: E to H- deletion or duplication. The most common 22q11.2 duplications are those of 3.0 Mb, which involve the LCRs from A to D, and those of 1.5 Mb, which encompass LCRs from A to B. For the reported patient, her distal duplication is atypical because it implies duplication of 1.306 Mb with F-H LCRs.

Currently, the patient has mild developmental delay and learning difficulties, hyperdontia (supernumerary teeth; Fig. 1c), and dental cavities. Nonetheless, she is living an independent life and is currently married. In order to investigate the presence of 22q11.2 deletion, which is associated with DGS/VCFS, and other genomic alterations, we performed multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) and array comparative genomic hybridization (array-CGH), respectively. Both techniques detected a de novo duplication (1:2, one normal chromosome and a 22q11.2 duplication in the other) of 2.5 Mb (nucleotide positions 18,894,835 to 21,464,119), supporting the diagnosis of 22q11.2 microduplication syndrome.

### Microduplication 22q11.2 in a child with autism spectrum disorder: clinical and genetic study [^749e9899]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Microduplication of the 22q11.2 chromosomal region has been recognized since 1999 and has been associated with a highly variable phenotype. Neurodevelopmental impairment and behavioural problems are very common in patients with 22q11.2 duplication. Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) have previously been reported in only two patients with 22q11.2 duplication and striking dysmorphic features. We report here on a 4-year-old male of healthy consanguineous parents presenting with ASD according to DSMIV, revised, criteria as a primary manifestation. The child walked at 16 months and started to say one word and some sounds. Parents noticed a subsequent developmental arrest. At 4 years his functional development age, evaluated by the Psychoeducational Profile, was roughly 6 months. Mild non-specific facial dysmorphism was noted. Genetic analyses of the child demonstrated a de novo microduplication of the 22q11.2 chromosomal region. This genetic anomaly was best seen in interphases of blood lymphocytes and in buccal smear nuclei. Our case illustrates once again the clinical heterogeneity of the 22q11.2 duplication as well as the wide genetic complexity of ASD. We suggest that genetic evaluation of ASD should include fluorescence in-situ hybridization analysis of the 22q11.2 chromosomal region.

### Microduplication 22q11.2, an emerging syndrome: clinical, cytogenetic, and molecular analysis of thirteen patients [^f8bb185f]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2003). Low credibility.

Chromosome 22, particularly band 22q11.2, is predisposed to rearrangements due to misalignments of low-copy repeats (LCRs). DiGeorge/velocardiofacial syndrome (DG/VCFS) is a common disorder resulting from microdeletion within the same band. Although both deletion and duplication are expected to occur in equal proportions as reciprocal events caused by LCR-mediated rearrangements, very few microduplications have been identified. We have identified 13 cases of microduplication 22q11.2, primarily by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The size of the duplications, determined by FISH probes from bacterial artificial chromosomes and P(1) artificial chromosomes, range from 3–4 Mb to 6 Mb, and the exchange points seem to involve an LCR. Molecular analysis based on 15 short tandem repeats confirmed the size of the duplications and indicated that at least 1 of 15 loci has three alleles present. The patients' phenotypes ranged from mild to severe, sharing a tendency for velopharyngeal insufficiency with DG/VCFS but having other distinctive characteristics, as well. Although the present series of patients was ascertained because of some overlapping features with DG/VCF syndromes, the microduplication of 22q11.2 appears to be a new syndrome.

### Velocardiofacial syndrome, diGeorge syndrome: the chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndromes [^58e8009e]. Lancet (2007). Excellent credibility.

Velocardiofacial syndrome, DiGeorge syndrome, and some other clinical syndromes have in common a high frequency of hemizygous deletions of chromosome 22q11.2. This deletion syndrome is very common, affecting nearly one in 3000 children. Here, we focus on recent advances in cardiac assessment, speech, immunology, and pathophysiology of velocardiofacial syndrome. The complex medical care of patients needs a multidisciplinary approach, and every patient has his own unique clinical features that need a tailored approach. Patients with chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome might have high level of functioning, but most often need interventions to improve the function of many organ systems.

### Identification of familial and de novo microduplications of 22q11.21-q11.23 distal to the 22q11.21 microdeletion syndrome region [^e85bd091]. Human Molecular Genetics (2009). Low credibility.

Deletions of the 22q11.2 region distal to the 22q11.21 microdeletion syndrome region have recently been described in individuals with mental retardation and congenital anomalies. Because these deletions are mediated by low-copy repeats (LCRs), located distal to the 22q11.21 DiGeorge/velocardiofacial microdeletion region, duplications are predicted to occur with a frequency equal to the deletion. However, few microduplications of this region have been reported. We report the identification of 18 individuals with microduplications of 22q11.21-q11.23. The duplication boundaries for all individuals are within LCRs distal to the DiGeorge/velocardiofacial microdeletion region. Clinical records for nine subjects reveal shared characteristics, but also several examples of contradicting clinical features (e.g. macrocephaly versus microcephaly and upslanting versus downslanting palpebral fissures). Of 12 cases for whom parental DNA samples were available for testing, one is de novo and 11 inherited the microduplication from a parent, three of whom reportedly have learning problems or developmental delay. The variable phenotypes and preponderance of familial cases obfuscate the clinical relevance of the molecular data and emphasize the need for careful parental assessments and clinical correlations.

### Chromosomal microdeletions: dissecting del22q11 syndrome [^3ab15171]. Nature Reviews: Genetics (2001). Medium credibility.

Identifying the genes that underlie the pathogenesis of chromosome deletion and duplication syndromes is a challenge because the affected chromosomal segment can contain many genes. The identification of genes that are relevant to these disorders often requires the analysis of individuals that carry rare, small deletions, translocations or single-gene mutations. Research into the chromosome 22 deletion (del22q11) syndrome, which encompasses DiGeorge and velocardiofacial syndrome, has taken a different path in recent years, using mouse models to circumvent the paucity of informative human material. These mouse models have provided new insights into the pathogenesis of del22q11 syndrome and have established strategies for research into chromosomal-deletion and -duplication syndromes.

### Further clinical and molecular delineation of the 15q24 microdeletion syndrome [^7d960f94]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

The introduction of genome-wide approaches to identify deletions and duplications throughout the human genome has facilitated the discovery of numerous novel causes for intellectual disability (ID), autism, and other developmental disorders. In the clinical work-up of undiagnosed intellectual disability, array comparative genomic hybridisation (aCGH) has the ability to make a diagnosis in 10–30% of cases. Recently, an international consensus has been reached that chromosomal microarray should be a first-tier clinical diagnostic test for individuals with developmental disabilities or congenital anomalies. It has also been shown that in many patients abnormal chromosomal microarray testing influences medical care by precipitating specialty referral, diagnostic imaging, or specific laboratory testing. For patients with well known classical microdeletion syndromes such as 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome and Williams syndrome, extensive data exist on clinical features observed in patients, and management guidelines have been developed. For newly discovered microdeletion/duplication syndromes, case reports and family support groups such as Unique, the Rare Chromosome Disorder Support Group, offer limited resources. Systematic characterisation of newly reported patients provides much needed information for clinicians and patients.

Recurrent microdeletion of chromosome 15q24 was described as a new genomic disorder after identification of patients with overlapping deletions, intellectual disability and similar clinical features. The 15q24 region is a complex genomic region with at least five segmental duplication (SD) blocks, also known as low copy repeats. These SD blocks, referred to as breakpoints A, B, C, D, and E, have varying amounts and degrees of sequence similarity to one another and can facilitate non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR) at meiosis, leading to deletion of the intervening sequence. NAHR between different SD blocks can lead to deletions of various sizes and with different breakpoints. To date, 18 patients with 15q24 deletions and detailed breakpoint analysis have been described in the medical literature. A characteristic 15q24 phenotype has been delineated with major features that include growth retardation, microcephaly, dysmorphic facial features, genital anomalies, and digital anomalies. Here we report clinical and molecular data for 15 patients with deletions in the 15q24 region, nearly doubling the number of reported patients. Among these, there are nine distinct deletions with different breakpoints, and two patients carry small, atypical deletions within the region that help delineate the critical region for core phenotypes in the 15q24 microdeletion syndrome. Finally, we offer recommendations for evaluation and management of patients with 15q24 deletion syndrome.

### Health supervision for children with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome: clinical report [^d28ad8e7]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS) — infancy and childhood presentation: Physically and immunologically healthy children with 22q11.2DS are most likely to present with developmental delay and growth impairment or short stature, and children with these nonspecific problems are more at risk of a diagnostic odyssey before final diagnosis. The short stature is not related to feeding problems and in only a minority of cases it is attributable to abnormalities of growth hormone. Developmental delays in general and speech/articulation disorders in particular may be the most prominent presenting feature in childhood, and various neurocognitive problems can be present, with approximately 20% of patients manifesting autism spectrum disorders.

22q11.2 deletions and duplications

The role of 22q11.2 deletions in CHD was well delineated before the advent of chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA). Cumulative prevalence estimates of this recurrent 22q11.2 deletion include ~50% in interrupted aortic arch type B, ~33% in truncus arteriosus, ~15% in TOF and 5–10% in VSD. Appreciation for other genome-wide rare recurrent and non-recurrent CNVs in CHD more generally has served to reinforce the importance of 22q11.2 deletions as the archetypal model for continued genetic discovery and clinical translation of findings. From a molecular genetic perspective, human and animal studies are shedding light on the specific determinants of cardiac expression (Box 1). From a clinical perspective, diagnosis is helpful and changes management, including genetic counselling.

General features of 22q11.2 deletions are proving to be generalisable to other CNVs associated with CHD. Although enriched for conotruncal and other anomalies, all types of CHD have been associated with 22q11.2 deletions. Severity ranges from non-viable (fetal and early pregnancy loss) to subclinical, e.g. spontaneously closing VSDs. Many patients do not have a CHD phenotype. If ascertainment is not through congenital cardiac clinics, the prevalence of readily detectable CHD may be as low as ~25–40%. Although multi-system expression is the norm over the lifetime, readily detectable congenital anomalies may not be present. The CHD may appear 'isolated', especially prenatally or at birth, as neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric features may not become apparent for years or decades. Dysmorphic features are usually subtle, and absence of 'typical' facial features does not affect the likelihood of the diagnosis being present or the severity of the presentation. Mortality is significantly increased, and surgical and perioperative complications in those with 22q11.2 deletions and conotruncal anomalies can be greater than other patients with the same CHD. The deletion may be inherited or de novo. If inherited, the parent with the deletion will often not have CHD or, if present, the same CHD or other features as the affected proband. There is a high mutation rate in the population due to the local genomic architecture: flanking segmental duplications and resulting increased risk of non-allelic homologous recombination during meiosis. The reciprocal duplication can result in similar phenotypes, including CHD.

### Atypical autism in a boy with double duplication of 22q11.2: implications of increasing dosage [^eea20aef]. NPJ Genomic Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

The 22q11.2 chromosomal region is susceptible to rearrangements due to the presence of several low-copy repeat sequences. These sequences facilitate non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR) between chromosomes leading to deletions and duplications, typically 1.5 to 3 megabases (Mb) in length. The 22q11.2 deletion syndrome has long been recognized as a heterogeneous condition characterized by congenital heart defect, cleft palate or velopharyngeal insufficiency, developmental delay, and a heightened predisposition to psychiatric disorders. The first individual with a duplication of the 22q11.2 region (3 copies) detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was described in 1999. Since then, over 50 additional cases have been reported, with highly variable features. Early reports were identified by FISH analysis for suspicion of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2 DS), and therefore were biased towards those with similar features. Clinical features reported in individuals ascertained by chromosomal microarray (CMA), in contrast, are often mild and highly variable, including cognitive and behavioral issues, congenital malformations, facial dysmorphism, and other health problems. The duplication is inherited from a parent in at least 70% of reported cases.

Here we describe a family of five, ascertained via the proband with atypical autism who carries a triplication (4 copies) of the 22q11.2 region, specifically two copies on each chromosome; herein referred to as "double duplication" (2:2). Both parents and the unaffected siblings carry the 22q11.2 duplication (2:1). To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of 22q11.2 double duplication. We describe in detail the clinical features of the proband, who clinically resembles a previously reported child with a triplication (3:1) at 22q11.2.

Xp21.2 duplication syndrome is a rare genetic disorder of undetermined prevalence and clinical relevance. As the use of chromosomal microarray has become first line for the work-up of childhood developmental delay, more gene deletions and duplications have been recognized. To the best of our knowledge, the imaging findings of Xp21.2 duplication syndrome have not been reported. We report a case of a 33 month-old male referred for developmental delay that was found to have an Xp21.2 duplication containing IL1RAPL1 and multiple midline brain malformations.

### A unique phenotype in a patient with a rare triplication of the 22q11.2 region and new clinical insights of the 22q11.2 microduplication syndrome: a report of two cases [^3c1b595f]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Patient 2, who has a father with 22q11.2 duplication and a normal mother, presents a triplication of the 22q11.2 region and, to our knowledge, this is the second case described in literature. In comparison to the first reported case, who presented speech delay, learning difficulties, and dysmorphic features, patient 2 has an aggravated phenotype characterized by heart defects (restrictive VSD and membranous subaortic stenosis), and presented other facial dysmorphisms and urogenital malformations (ovarian cyst; Table 1). The patient also has a hemangioma planum on the right side of her face. This latter sign is consistent with one of the diagnostic criteria of Sturge-Weber syndrome. As we know, this syndrome is a sporadic congenital neurocutaneous disorder, caused by a somatic activating mutation (c.548G > A, p. Arg183Gln) in GNAQ gene. Clinically, it is characterized by the presence of nevus flammeus (port-wine stain), involving the area of the first sensory branch of the trigeminal nerve. The second and third trigeminal branches might be involved, by cerebral venous malformations (ipsilateral leptomeningeal angiomatosis) and by glaucoma with ocular capillary venous vascular malformations. Sturge-Weber syndrome has been associated with epilepsy, behavioral disorders, cognitive impairment, headaches, spastic hemiparesis, and visual fields defects. In fact, patient 2 presents similar features (Table 1) and possibly has the somatic mutation c.548G > A (p. Arg183Gln) in the GNAQ gene.

### Evaluation of 100 Dutch cases with 16p11.2 deletion and duplication syndromes; from clinical manifestations towards personalized treatment options [^cfc0d086]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2024). Medium credibility.

In current clinical genetic practice, 5–7% of cases with ID/congenital malformations are diagnosed with two different Mendelian disorders. Dual diagnoses have also been described for 16p11.2 deletion syndrome. Trained clinicians will have to decide whether more extensive genetic testing, following a molecular 16p11.2 deletion or duplication diagnosis, is recommended. In our cohort, additional genetic testing was performed in the majority of cases. Dual diagnoses identified in our cohort, should encourage to pay close attention to whether an individual's phenotype is fully explained by the 16p11.2 CNV (Table 2). For example, one case with distal 16p11.2 BP2-BP3 deletion had a short stature (height (SDS –2.9)) and congenital heart defect, both cardinal features of Noonan syndrome. We indeed confirmed this second diagnosis. As this second diagnosis could affect our results and conclusions, we excluded this particular case from our subgroup analyses. Clinical overlap of two syndromes makes it harder to realize that these cases could have a dual diagnosis. We recommend consultation of a clinical geneticist in case of severe or previously unreported symptoms. Importantly, we mentioned one case with an apparent de novo typical 16p11.2 BP4-BP5 deletion when tested using array-CGH, whose mother eventually carried the same typical 16p11.2 BP4-BP5 deletion in mosaic form when reanalyzed with SNP array nine years later. Even though this is a rare finding, it can be relevant for siblings of cases with an apparent de novo deletion, who were analyzed with previous genetic techniques.

### Complex segmental duplications mediate a recurrent dup (X) (p11.22-p11.23) associated with mental retardation, speech delay, and EEG anomalies in males and females [^24a50aaa]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2009). Low credibility.

Submicroscopic copy-number variations make a considerable contribution to the genetic etiology of human disease. We have analyzed subjects with idiopathic mental retardation (MR) by using whole-genome oligonucleotide-based array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) and identified familial and de novo recurrent Xp11.22-p11.23 duplications in males and females with MR, speech delay, and a peculiar electroencephalographic (EEG) pattern in childhood. The size of the duplications ranges from 0.8–9.2 Mb. Most affected females show preferential activation of the duplicated X chromosome. Carriers of the smallest duplication show X-linked recessive inheritance. All other affected individuals present dominant expression and comparable clinical phenotypes irrespective of sex, duplication size, and X-inactivation pattern. The majority of the rearrangements are mediated by recombination between flanking complex segmental duplications. The identification of common clinical features, including the typical EEG pattern, predisposing genomic structure, and peculiar X-inactivation pattern, suggests that duplication of Xp11.22-p11.23 constitutes a previously undescribed syndrome.

### Dissecting the phenotypic spectrum and complexity of movement disorders in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome [^365922d3]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Over the last 30 years, 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS) has been increasingly diagnosed. This complex genomic syndrome presents with variably penetrant neuropsychiatric features, with movement disorders representing important late‐occurring manifestations. Since 2013, evidence has identified the 22q11.2 microdeletion as a genetic risk factor for early‐onset Parkinson's Disease (PD) with a clinico‐pathologic presentation largely indistinguishable from sporadic PD. Other studies have reported an expanding range of motor phenotypes, including other hypokinetic, hyperkinetic, functional, and drug‐induced movement disorders. However, a systematic characterization of movement disorder phenomenologies, electrophysiologic features, and management in 22q11.2DS remains limited.

Here, we aimed to more deeply phenotype clinically relevant motor manifestations of 22q11.2DS based on comprehensive neurologic assessments at a major center of excellence in movement disorders. We focused on phenomenological classifications, electrophysiologic findings, and therapeutic response in an effort to enhance diagnosis and management. Recognizing the link between antipsychotic treatment and extrapyramidal motor symptoms in a condition with an elevated risk for schizophrenia, we explored the influence of antipsychotic use on movement disorder presentations in 22q11.2DS.

### Clinical and genomic evaluation of 201 patients with phelan-mcDermid syndrome [^af4b39b7]. Human Genetics (2014). Low credibility.

This study is the first to describe age-related changes in a large cohort of patients with Phelan-McDermid syndrome (PMS), also known as 22q13 deletion syndrome. Over a follow-up period of up to 12 years, physical examinations and structured interviews were conducted for 201 individuals diagnosed with PMS, 120 patients had a focused, high-resolution 22q12q13 array CGH, and 92 patients' deletions were assessed for parent-of-origin. 22q13 genomic anomalies include terminal deletions of 22q13 (89%), terminal deletions and interstitial duplications (9%), and interstitial deletions (2%). Considering different age groups, in older patients, behavioral problems tended to subside, developmental abilities improved, and some features such as large or fleshy hands, full or puffy eyelids, hypotonia, lax ligaments, and hyperextensible joints were less frequent. However, the proportion reporting an autism spectrum disorder, seizures, and cellulitis, or presenting with lymphedema or abnormal reflexes increased with age. Some neurologic and dysmorphic features such as speech and developmental delay and macrocephaly correlated with deletion size. Deletion sizes in more recently diagnosed patients tend to be smaller than those diagnosed a decade earlier. Seventy-three percent of de novo deletions were of paternal origin. Seizures were reported three times more often among patients with a de novo deletion of the maternal rather than paternal chromosome 22. This analysis improves the understanding of the clinical presentation and natural history of PMS and can serve as a reference for the prevalence of clinical features in the syndrome.

### 22q11.2 deletion syndrome [^5424a1ac]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2015). Medium credibility.

22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS) is the most common chromosomal microdeletion disorder, estimated to result mainly from de novo non-homologous meiotic recombination events occurring in approximately 1 in every 1,000 fetuses. The first description in the English language of the constellation of findings now known to be due to this chromosomal difference was made in the 1960s in children with DiGeorge syndrome, who presented with the clinical triad of immunodeficiency, hypoparathyroidism and congenital heart disease. The syndrome is now known to have a heterogeneous presentation that includes multiple additional congenital anomalies and later-onset conditions, such as palatal, gastrointestinal and renal abnormalities, autoimmune disease, variable cognitive delays, behavioural phenotypes and psychiatric illness - all far extending the original description of DiGeorge syndrome. Management requires a multidisciplinary approach involving paediatrics, general medicine, surgery, psychiatry, psychology, interventional therapies (physical, occupational, speech, language and behavioural) and genetic counselling. Although common, lack of recognition of the condition and/or lack of familiarity with genetic testing methods, together with the wide variability of clinical presentation, delays diagnosis. Early diagnosis, preferably prenatally or neonatally, could improve outcomes, thus stressing the importance of universal screening. Equally important, 22q11.2DS has become a model for understanding rare and frequent congenital anomalies, medical conditions, psychiatric and developmental disorders, and may provide a platform to better understand these disorders while affording opportunities for translational strategies across the lifespan for both patients with 22q11.2DS and those with these associated features in the general population.

### Neurocognitive profiles of 22q11.2 and 16p11.2 deletions and duplications [^3c16aac8]. Molecular Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The "genetics first" approach has investigated recurrent rare copy number variants (CNVs), such as those associated with chromosome 22q11.2 and 16p11.2, providing evidence of increased risk for neurodevelopmental psychiatric disorders across the lifespan. This line of research builds on individuals diagnosed when presenting clinically for evaluation and care at health care facilities and centers that recruit for research on rare genetic disorders. There are common neurobehavioral features associated with these CNVs that manifest transdiagnostically in Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, Anxiety Disorders, Mood Disorders, Autism Spectrum Disorders, Schizophrenia and Psychosis Spectrum Disorders. Notably, features of neurodevelopmental psychiatric disorders associated with these CNVs are similar to the presentation and course of some idiopathic (behaviorally defined) neurodevelopmental disorders. Among rare CNVs, 22q11.2 deletion and duplication as well as 16p11.2 deletion and duplication have been examined for developmental psychiatric disorders including cognitive functioning. A survey conducted at the Geisinger Health System reported that 22q11.2 duplication (0.119%) and 16p11.2 deletion (0.078%) were the most prevalent CNVs and were associated with lifelong cognitive and psychiatric disabilities documented in electronic health records. The extent and nature of neurocognitive deficits associated with these deletions and duplications varies, and studies to date have usually examined a single CNV or either deletions or duplications. Furthermore, these studies have used varied quantity and quality of neurocognitive assessments, with most focusing on an "intelligence quotient" (IQ) assessed as part of a clinical or research evaluation.

### Partial tetrasomy of chromosome 22: genetic and surgical implications for otolaryngologists [^4676d063]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Partial tetrasomy of chromosome 22 is a rare multiple congenital anomaly syndrome that is more commonly known as cat-eve syndrome (CES). It is caused by the duplication of a 2-million base region of chromosome 22 (22 pter → q 11 x 2). The phenotype is extremely variable, and its clinical characteristics include a combination of craniofacial, cardiac, renal, gastrointestinal, and genito-urinary defects. We describe a rare occurrence of CES in a Brazilian family: Three siblings were affected — monozygotic twin boys and their younger brother. All 3 were born to healthy nonconsanguineous parents. On examination, all 3 were found to have strabismus, primary telecanthus, bilateral coloboma iridis, and low-set ears with posterior rotation of the pinnae. Partial tetrasomy of chromosome 22 was confirmed by fluorescent in situ hybridization. To our knowledge, this is the first report of such an occurrence in one family. We discuss the genotype and phenotype of CES, with particular reference to inheritance patterns and craniofacial defects.

### Clinical and molecular cytogenetic findings of cat eye syndrome and a 2-year-old patient with congenital aural atresia and hearing loss [^5bc9c1df]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Cat eye syndrome (CES) is a rare congenital disease frequently caused by a partial tetrasomy of the proximal long (q) arm of chromosome 22, due to a small supernumerary marker chromosome (sSMC). CES patients show remarkable phenotypic variability. Despite the progress of molecular cytogenetic technology, the cause of phenotypic variability and the genotype–phenotype correlations remain unknown.

Methods

We analyzed clinical and genetic data of a new patient with CES together with 27 previously reported ones with a confirmed genomic gain in the PubMed database between 2012 and 2023.

Results

We reported a boy with CES carrying a 22q11.1-q11.21 duplication of 1.76 Mb tetrasomy (16888900_18644241, hg19) who presented currently rare or unreported clinical findings such as congenital aural atresia, hearing loss, PLSVC, and IVC. The results of the whole exome sequencing (WES) showed a heterozygous mutation of the GJB2 gene (NM_004004.6: exon2: c.109G > A). In addition, the results of our literature review showed that the presence of a classical sSMC was the most frequent cytogenetic abnormality in CES (82%). 63% of cases were in a homogenous state and 37% of cases were in a mosaic state. 72% of cases had a 1–2 Mb duplication. In the majority of CES patients the breakpoints in chromosome 22 are localized to a 50 kb region (18610000_18660000 bp). The CES critical region (CESCR) may be further delimited to a 0.3 Mb region (17799398_18111588 bp). Within this region CECR2, SLC25A18, ATP6V1E1, and BCL2L13 are strong candidate genes for causing the main CES phenotype. The ear anomalies are the most frequent features in CES patients (89%) and hearing loss was present in 36% of CES patients.

Conclusions

The phenotypic features in CES are highly variable. Our findings expand the symptom spectrum of CES and lay the foundation for better delineating the clinical phenotype, molecular cytogenetic features associated with CES and genotype–phenotype correlations. We recommend performing WES to rule out the involvement of other genetic factors in the patient's phenotype. In addition, our findings also highlight the need for genetic counseling and recurrence risk assessment.

### Health supervision for children with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome: clinical report [^f0a42cfa]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

22q11.2 deletion syndrome — testing strategy and karyotype limitations are specified: Postnatal testing is unnecessary if the diagnosis is prenatally established by chorionic villus or amniotic fluid sampling. FISH and microarray are redundant, and it is not cost-effective to pursue both; microarray is sufficient and preferred. Routine chromosome analysis is inadequate because a deletion must be 4 to 5 Mb to be visible by light microscopy, and the standard deletion is about half that.

Known etiology

A fifth (20.2%, n = 1114) of cases were assigned a known etiology (table 3). As shown in figure 2, 90.4% of the cases with a known etiology were represented by the three common trisomies (21, 18, 13), Turner syndrome, structural chromosomal abnormalities, and single gene disorders.

For the known etiology case group, 57 (5.1% of 1114) were further classified as a sequence (n = 35, 61.4%), a developmental field defect (n = 13, 22.8%), or a known pattern (n = 10, 17.5%) (data not shown). Of the remaining two cases with VATER/VACTERL association (known pattern), one case occurred with pregestational diabetes (teratogen) and another with partial trisomy (7q11.21 duplication) (chromosomal-structure).

### Health supervision for children with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome: clinical report [^82f6718c]. Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

22q11.2 deletion syndrome is the most frequent chromosomal microdeletion syndrome, with an estimated frequency of about 1/4000 in children younger than 1 year. Associated features in neonates and infants are conotruncal heart defects, interrupted aortic arch type B, cleft palate, hypocalcemia (which can present as seizures), feeding problems, developmental delay, and immune system abnormalities. Older children, adolescents, and adults may have neurocognitive impairments and/or speech disorders. Psychiatric diagnoses are more common than in the general population. Newborn infants may have a positive newborn screening for severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). Genetic diagnosis is confirmed by chromosome microarray. This document is intended to provide guidance for health care providers to help identify individual patients at high risk of developing serious sequelae and to enable intervention before complications develop.

DiGeorge syndrome, or chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, is a disorder affecting multiple organ systems. The immunologist may be called on to coordinate complex medical care tailored to the specific needs and unique clinical features of each patient. This article focuses on the immune system, but patients require a holistic approach. Attention to cardiac, nutritional, and developmental needs in early infancy is important, and it is critical to identify the rare infants who require either a lymphocyte or thymus transplant. Later, speech and school issues dominate the picture. Allergies and autoimmune disorders also may be troubling for some school-age children.

### Chromothripsis and ring chromosome 22: a paradigm of genomic complexity in the phelan-mcDermid syndrome (22q13 deletion syndrome) [^3f992246]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

We demonstrate for the first time the occurrence of a constitutional chromoanagenesis event resulting in the formation a ring chromosome, with both copy number losses and gains, leading to a PMS phenotype associated with BPP and atopic dermatitis with urticarial rashes. The outcome of concurrent deletions, duplications, gene interruptions and TAD is a dramatically complex phenotype. This study reinforces the growing evidence that chromosomal rearrangements (1) may be not as simple as they appear by conventional diagnostic approaches and (2) affect the phenotype by global alteration of the topological chromatin organisation rather than simply by the deletion or duplication of dosage-sensitive genes.

### Psychiatric disorders in children with 16p11.2 deletion and duplication [^31c207a7]. Translational Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Clinical implications and future directions

This study clearly indicates that the phenotypic effects of the 16p11.2 deletion and duplication extend to include non-ASD psychopathology. The high frequency of psychiatric disorders, especially ADHD, in childhood indicates the need for recognition, diagnosis, and treatment early in development. Longitudinal studies are needed to examine the natural history of these disorders and whether specific types of treatment (e.g. stimulant medication for ADHD) are beneficial. Not all children met criteria for a psychiatric disorder, supporting previous literature indicating that there is a spectrum of manifestations of the 16p11.2 deletions and duplications, similar to other CNVs (e.g. 22q11.2DS).

Future studies could examine the extent to which assortative mating plays a role in psychiatric risk in children from families where a CNV is inherited compared to where it occurs de novo. Further exploration of the extent to which background genetic as well as environmental risk factors contribute to the risk of psychiatric disorder in carriers with a de novo versus an inherited CNV is also important.

### Schizophrenia and 22q11.2 deletion syndrome [^88e550f1]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2008). Low credibility.

22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22qDS) is a genetic syndrome associated with a chromosome 22q11.2 deletion and variable phenotypic expression that commonly includes schizophrenia. Approximately 1% of patients with schizophrenia have 22qDS. The schizophrenia in 22qDS appears broadly similar to that found in the general population with respect to core signs and symptoms, treatment response, neurocognitive profile, and MRI brain anomalies. However, individuals with a 22qDS form of schizophrenia typically have distinguishable physical features, have a lower IQ, and may differ in auxiliary clinical features. IQ, length of 22q11.2 deletions, and COMT functional allele do not appear to be major risk factors for schizophrenia in 22qDS. Ascertainment biases and small sample sizes are limitations of most studies. Larger studies over the lifespan and continuing education about this underrecognized condition are needed. 22qDS-schizophrenia is an important genetic subtype and a valuable model of neurodevelopmental mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia.

### Optic nerve coloboma as extension of the phenotype of 22q11.23 duplication syndrome: a case report [^46d3c9ee]. BMC Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

22q11.2 duplication syndrome (Dup22q11.2; Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) # 608363) is a genetic disorder with a dominant autosomal inheritance pattern, reduced penetrance and variable expressivity. The same chromosomal region involved in this syndrome is deleted in DiGeorge syndrome. Although both deletion and duplication are expected to occur in equal proportions as reciprocal events, very few duplications have been identified. While the calculated prevalence of DiGeorge syndrome is 1 of each 4000 new born, only around of 100 cases of Dup22q11.2 had been reported. This disparity in the prevalence of both syndromes could be explained at least in part because the phenotype of the duplication is not well understood.

In the majority of cases, the size of the duplication varies between 1.5 and 3.0 million base pairs (Mb). The phenotype is variable and has been reported to include intellectual disabilities, severe psychomotor development delays, language disorders, dysmorphic facial features and hypotonia; however, others with duplication do not present particular phenotypic findings.

In patients with Dup22q11.2, ocular findings such as ptosis, down-slanting palpebral fissures, epicanthal fold, hypertelorism, astigmatism, strabismus, hyperopia, myopia, nystagmus, chorioretinal coloboma, retinal vascular tortuosity and primary congenital glaucoma have been described.

Array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) is a molecular test that evaluates the entire genome and detects numerical and structural chromosome alterations throughout all chromosomes; this diagnostic technique surpasses karyotyping by light microscopy by finding deletions and duplications up to 10,000 times smaller. The aCGH is a test used in the differential diagnosis of patients with intellectual disabilities, psychomotor development delay, autism, and multiple congenital anomalies.

We report a patient with Dup22q11.2 with optic nerve coloboma and dysplasia in the contralateral optic nerve, findings not described in the reviewed literature, contributing to the phenotypic characterization of the syndrome and the epidemiology of this rare genetic disorder. In addition, through bioinformatics analysis of the genes mapped to the 22q11.2 region, deregulation of the SPECC1L gene could be implicated in the development of coloboma.

### Optic nerve coloboma as extension of the phenotype of 22q11.23 duplication syndrome: a case report [^da6f30fe]. BMC Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Cat eye syndrome (CES) is found in the differential diagnosis of Dup22q11.2 syndrome. Coloboma of the iris, retina and choroids, preauricular pits and appendages and anal atresia have been reported in those affected by CES; however, these characteristics are not consistently found in patients with CES. Common findings include intellectual disability, down-slanting palpebral fissures, cleft palate, congenital heart defects, renal and urinary tract abnormalities, and bone defects. The patient described here presented several of the phenotypic features of CES.

CES is caused in most cases by the presence of a bisatellite supernumerary marker chromosome, formed by two copies of the proximal part of chromosome 22, which includes satellites, the entire short arm, the centromere and part of the long arm corresponding to the 22q11 region. This additional chromosome, which occurs in mosaics in one-third of cases, usually has two centromeres and is the product of an inverted duplication 22q11, resulting in partial tetrasomy of this segment, whose distal limit is superimposed on the common distal deletion breakpoint of the 3 Mb deletion seen in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. The patient reported here presented coloboma of the optic nerve, not of the retina, nor of the iris, and did not have other frequent characteristics of CES, such as anal atresia or preauricular abnormalities. In addition, the 22q11.23 duplication found in the patient was not included in the region involved in CES. Therefore, the patient did not meet the criteria for a CES diagnosis.

### A framework to identify contributing genes in patients with phelan-mcDermid syndrome [^09ae60d5]. NPJ Genomic Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Phelan-McDermid syndrome (PMS) is characterized by a variety of clinical symptoms with heterogeneous degrees of severity, including intellectual disability (ID), absent or delayed speech, and autism spectrum disorders (ASD). It results from a deletion of the distal part of chromosome 22q13 that in most cases includes the SHANK3 gene. SHANK3 is considered a major gene for PMS, but the factors that modulate the severity of the syndrome remain largely unknown. In this study, we investigated 85 patients with different 22q13 rearrangements (78 deletions and 7 duplications). We first explored the clinical features associated with PMS, and provide evidence for frequent corpus callosum abnormalities in 28% of 35 patients with brain imaging data. We then mapped several candidate genomic regions at the 22q13 region associated with high risk of clinical features, and suggest a second locus at 22q13 associated with absence of speech. Finally, in some cases, we identified additional clinically relevant copy-number variants (CNVs) at loci associated with ASD, such as 16p11.2 and 15q11q13, which could modulate the severity of the syndrome. We also report an inherited SHANK3 deletion transmitted to five affected daughters by a mother without ID nor ASD, suggesting that some individuals could compensate for such mutations. In summary, we shed light on the genotype-phenotype relationship of patients with PMS, a step towards the identification of compensatory mechanisms for a better prognosis and possibly treatments of patients with neurodevelopmental disorders.

### Co-occurrence of recurrent duplications of the diGeorge syndrome region on both chromosome 22 homologues due to inherited and de novo events [^10ddcb72]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Genomic rearrangements usually involve one of the two chromosome homologues. Homozygous microdeletion/duplication is very rare. The chromosome 22q11.2 region is prone to recurrent rearrangements due to the presence of low-copy repeats. A common 3 Mb microdeletion causes the well-characterised DiGeorge syndrome (DGS). The reciprocal duplication is associated with an extremely variable phenotype, ranging from apparently normal to learning disabilities and multiple congenital anomalies.

Methods and Results

We describe duplications of the DGS region on both homologues in five patients from three families, detected by array CGH and confirmed by both fluorescence in situ hybridisation and single nucleotide polymorphism arrays. The proband in the first family is homozygous for the common duplication; one maternally inherited and the other a de novo duplication that was generated by nonallelic homologous recombination during spermatogenesis. The 22q11.2 duplications in the four individuals from the other two families are recurrent duplications on both homologues, one inherited from the mother and the other from the father. The phenotype in the patients with a 22q11.2 tetrasomy is similar to the features seen in duplication patients, including cognitive deficits and variable congenital defects.

Conclusions

Our studies that reveal phenotypic variability in patients with four copies of the 22q11.2 genomic segment, demonstrate that both inherited and de novo events can result in the generation of homozygous duplications, and further document how multiple seemingly rare events can occur in a single individual.

### Dissecting the phenotypic spectrum and complexity of movement disorders in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome [^397b2d4c]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

2 Methods

2.1 Phenotypic Characterization

We included adult patients (age ≥ 18 years) with a molecularly confirmed typical chromosome 22q11.2 microdeletion consecutively assessed at the Toronto Western Hospital Movement Disorders Centre, Toronto, Canada from June 1996 to September 2023. Patients without molecular confirmation of 22q11.2 microdeletion, and genetically diagnosed cases without a movement disorder based on detailed neurologic assessments were excluded.

Retrospective review of medical records was conducted to collect relevant clinico‐demographic variables and characterize motor phenotypes based on the clinical history, neurologic examination, and diagnostic impression made by the treating specialist. Medication histories and videotaped examinations were carefully reviewed, and standard definitions and clinical criteria were applied to further classify movement disorders. Where clinically indicated and data were available, results of special movement disorder electrophysiologic tests from our centre, as well as data regarding effective pharmacologic and non‐pharmacologic therapies were obtained. For patients with parkinsonism, we additionally noted the presence of motor fluctuations, levodopa‐induced dyskinesia, use of dopaminergic and adjunctive therapies, total levodopa equivalent daily dose (LEDD), and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Part III (UPDRS or MDS‐UPDRS III) scores in the OFF and ON states (additional details are in Supporting Information).

Within the full cohort, we delineated unpublished and previously reported cases. To assess the degree of individual‐level complexity of phenotypic presentations, we analyzed the full cohort to quantify the frequency of movement disorder phenomenologies per individual. To characterize novel phenotypes, we noted (1) movement disorders in unpublished cases, and (2) newly described clinical and/or electrophysiological diagnoses in previously reported cases during their follow‐up movement disorder assessments.

This study was approved by the local research ethics board. For more information regarding the methods, see Supporting Information.

2.2 Statistical Analysis

Descriptive statistics using median (interquartile range [IQR] or range) for continuous variables, and frequencies and proportions for categorical data were applied. Where appropriate, we used Fisher's exact test and Mann–Whitney U test to explore the relationship between antipsychotic exposure and relevant clinical and motor‐related features. Additional information regarding exploratory analyses can be found in the Supporting Information. Statistical analyses were performed using Stata Statistical Software: Release 17 (College Station, Tx: StataCorp LLC).

### Metabolic signature of the pathogenic 22q11.2 deletion identifies carriers and provides insight into systemic dysregulation [^020a4c8c]. Translational Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS) was first reported in 1965 by Dr Angelo DiGeorge and correspondingly named DiGeorge syndrome. It is the most common chromosomal microdeletion syndrome, with an estimated incidence of 1 over 3672 live births. Deletions of various sizes are gathered under the 22q11.2DS name, but the most common is a 3MB deletion in between two low copy repeats (LCRs) zones (LCR22A and LCR22D).

Irrespective of deletion size, 22q11.2DS comes with heterogeneous clinical presentation, including several very severe conditions. None of the clinical presentations are specific to 22q11.2DS, and far from all carriers are clinically ascertained. In fact, a considerable proportion of 22q11.2DS (~10%) is inherited, typically from clinically un-affected or non-recognized parents carrying the deletion, and has been reported to be more severely affected than de-novo cases. Among the clinical presentations detected in utero or at birth, congenital heart defects are the most frequent, followed by velopharyngeal insufficiency, cleft palate, or dysmorphic craniofacial features. Many disorders will only be detectable or develop later in life, such as hypocalcemia due to primary hypoparathyroidism, as well as developmental disabilities, mental disorders, and life-threatening severe chronic immune deficiency. While the syndrome is not curable, many of the clinical manifestations can be improved if treated in a timely manner.

### A complex rearrangement on chromosome 22 affecting both homologues; haplo-insufficiency of the cat eye syndrome region may have no clinical relevance [^66026303]. Human Genetics (2006). Low credibility.

The presence of highly homologous sequences, known as low copy repeats, predisposes for unequal recombination within the 22q11 region. This can lead to genomic imbalances associated with several known genetic disorders. We report here a developmentally delayed patient carrying different rearrangements on both chromosome 22 homologues, including a previously unreported rearrangement within the 22q11 region. One homologue carries a deletion of the proximal part of chromosome band 22q11. To our knowledge, a 'pure' deletion of this region has not been described previously. Four copies of this 22q11 region, however, are associated with Cat eye syndrome (CES). While the phenotypic impact of this deletion is unclear, familial investigation revealed five normal relatives carrying this deletion, suggesting that haplo-insufficiency of the CES region has little clinical relevance. The other chromosome 22 homologue carries a duplication of the Velocardiofacial/DiGeorge syndrome (VCFS/DGS) region. In addition, a previously undescribed deletion of 22q12.1, located in a relatively gene-poor region, was identified. As the clinical features of patients suffering from a duplication of the VCFS/DGS region have proven to be extremely variable, it is impossible to postulate as to the contribution of the 22q12.1 deletion to the phenotype of the patient. Additional patients with a deletion within this region are needed to establish the consequences of this copy number alteration. This study highlights the value of using different genomic approaches to unravel chromosomal alterations in order to study their phenotypic impact.

22q11.2 deletion syndrome — family testing and counseling points include that the majority (> 90%) of patients are the first affected individual in their family and, when neither parent has the deletion, recurrence risk is 1%. Ten percent of patients inherited the deletion from an affected parent. 22q11.2DS is an autosomal-dominant condition; a person with the deletion has a 50% risk of passing it on, and parents with the deletion should be counseled that their risk of another affected child is 50% with each pregnancy; other children in the family with suggestive features warrant testing.

### Population prevalence and inheritance pattern of recurrent CNVs associated with neurodevelopmental disorders in 12, 252 newborns and their parents [^fadea7ae]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2021). Medium credibility.

22q11.2 microdeletions can cause a range of symptoms with variable expressivity previously described as DiGeorge syndrome and velocardiofacial syndrome (MIM:188400; MIM:192430). This microdeletion is reported as one of the most common recurrent deletions in clinical cohorts and has also been associated with a range of psychiatric disorders including SCZ and ADHD. We found only 1 carrier (de novo) among the 12,252 offspring in this study. This is considerably lower than what is the commonly cited figures for the prevalence of the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome in the literature of more than 1 per 2000 newborns to 1 in 4000. Our results suggest that the true prevalence of the 22q11 deletion is lower, and more likely is around 1 in 12,000. The reciprocal duplication is more common in our study. We observed two de novo and four inherited events in 12,252 offspring. This is in line with a milder phenotype/lower penetrance for duplications at this locus.

### Atypical autism in a boy with double duplication of 22q11.2: implications of increasing dosage [^a3bfb9df]. NPJ Genomic Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

We present the first reported case of "double duplication" of the 22q11.2 region. Probands with this duplication have a wide range of phenotypes affecting physical and cognitive development, and the duplication is frequently inherited from a parent. Thus, it remains unclear whether increased dosage of this region truly causes a recognizable phenotype. Some authors have speculated that it could be a benign polymorphism or a risk variant which requires a "second hit" in order to result in a clinically significant phenotype. A second hit could, in theory, be an additional copy of the same region, assuming that one or more of the involved genes are dosage sensitive. The triplicated region in our proband contains 66 RefSeq genes, including TBX1 and CRKL; cardiac defects in the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome have been attributed to haploinsufficiency of these two genes. Our proband had pulmonic stenosis, while another triplication proband had sub-aortic stenosis and a ventricular septal defect. Although experimental evidence is lacking, it is plausible that increased dosage of these genes could also predispose to aberrant cardiac development. The only other report of a proband with a 22q11.2 triplication, also (3:1), is an 8-year-old girl with a strikingly similar phenotype to our proband: learning difficulties, social immaturity, and similar dysmorphic features.

Another possible reason for our proband's phenotype, in particular his autistic features, is the contribution of additional mutations in autism candidate genes. We investigated this by analyzing the genome sequence of the proband and his parents using our variant pipeline optimized for identification of ASD-related genes; however, we are yet to identify any convincing additional mutations that would be clinically characterized as being pathogenic for ASD. Alternatively, it is possible that increased copy number at 22q11.2 could contribute to vulnerability to ASD; at least one study has reported a relatively high prevalence of autism in probands with 22q11.2 duplication. From a genomic point of view, this case could be considered as an example of a recessive disorder caused by copy number gains, since the parents carrying three copies are normal, but the proband carrying four copies presents with a phenotype.

### Molecular characterisation of patients with subtelomeric 22q abnormalities using chromosome specific array-based comparative genomic hybridisation [^e10c26f8]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2005). Low credibility.

The 22q13 deletion syndrome is associated with global developmental delay, absent or delayed speech, and generalised hypotonia. In this study, the size and nature of 22q13 deletions (n = 9) were studied in detail by high-resolution chromosome specific array-based comparative genomic hybridisation (array CGH). The deletion sizes varied considerably between the different patients, that is, the largest deletion spanning 8.4 Mb with the breakpoint mapping to 22q13.2 and the smallest deletion spanning 3.3 Mb with the breakpoint mapping to 22q13.31. In one case, a unique subtelomeric 3.9 Mb deletion associated with a 2.0 Mb duplication of 22q13 was observed, adding to a growing number of similar cases identified for other chromosome ends. Remarkably, this patient had signs suggestive of retinitis pigmentosa, which has never been reported before in the 22q13 deletion syndrome. The identification of two pairs of recurrent proximal breakpoints on 22q13 suggests that these specific regions may be prone to recombination, due to yet unknown genome architectural features. In addition to the copy number changes on 22q13, a duplication of approximately 330 kb on 22q11.1 was observed and shown to be a genetic large-scale copy number variation without clinical consequences. The current study failed to reveal relationships between the clinical features and the deletion sizes. Global developmental delay and absent or severely delayed speech were observed in all patients, whereas hypotonia was present in 89% of the cases (8/9). This study underscores the utility of array CGH for characterising the size and nature of subtelomeric deletions, such as monosomy 22q13, and underlines the considerable variability in deletion size in the 22q13 deletion syndrome regardless of the clinical phenotype.

Duplication 22q11.2 syndrome is the result of a microduplication of the same chromosomal region that is deleted in DiGeorge and Velocardiofacial syndromes. We describe a patient with dysmorphic features who was diagnosed with pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and developed cystinuria and pancreatitis during treatment. Duplication 22q11.2 has not been previously described in association with hematologic abnormalities. Chromosomal microarray technology was used to diagnose duplication 22q11.2 syndrome. In this era of advanced genomics, this technology has become an important method for helping to determine the molecular basis of diseases, best treatments and ultimately patient outcomes.

### Clinical and molecular cytogenetic findings of cat eye syndrome and a 2-year-old patient with congenital aural atresia and hearing loss [^be77dda4]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Cat eye syndrome (CES) (OMIM 115470), also known as Schmid-Fraccaro syndrome, is a rare congenital disease with a population incidence of about 1:50,000–1:150,000. CES is frequently caused by a partial tetrasomy of the proximal long (q) arm of chromosome 22, due to a small supernumerary marker chromosome (sSMC). The 22q11 region is highly susceptible to chromosomal rearrangements due to multiple highly homologous repetitive regions, known as low copy repeats (LCRs). Duplications and deletions of proximal chromosome 22q have been associated with a few syndromes and developmental abnormalities such as CES and DiGeorge/velocardiofacial syndrome (DGS/VCFS).

Almost all the published studies on CES have highlighted a widely variable phenotype. Coloboma of the iris, ear, and anal malformations are known as the classic clinical triad. However, only 41% of CES patients display all three classic features. CES patients can also present down-slanting palpebral fissures, hypertelorism, cleft palate, spina bifida, congenital heart, skeletal anomalies and renal malformations. In addition, almost half of patients have mild or moderate developmental delay, but growth is not usually affected. However, congenital aural atresia and hearing loss are less discussed in published studies. In the last 10 years, single nucleotide polymorphism array (SNP-array), array comparative genomic hybridization (array-CGH) and copy number variation sequencing (CNV-seq) technologies have been widely used in the detection of genomic diseases. Some new molecular alternations have been described in CES patients. To better delineate the clinical and molecular cytogenetics findings associated with CES, we reviewed 26 CES patients reported since 2012 (including the current case) with confirmed molecular cytogenetic testing and found some meaningful results.

Implications for Clinical Care/Outcomes Improvement/Future Research

Perioperative Management

With an increased understanding of how genetic factors affect clinical outcomes (summarized in Table 2), there will be opportunities to target therapies to the specific needs of each individual patient. Currently, the most important role for preoperative genetic testing is in the CHD patient with possible 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. As noted above, patients with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome have thymic hypoplasia, which requires special handling of blood products before transfusion or exposure during cardiopulmonary bypass. Since clinical features of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome may not be apparent, especially in infants, testing for 22q11.2 deletion should be performed by fluorescent in situ hybridization, multiplex ligation‐dependent probe amplification assay, or quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Alternatively, chromosomal microarray testing can detect microdeletions and duplications anywhere throughout the genome. In addition to special handling of blood products, serum calcium levels need to be closely monitored and repleted as needed. The differential outcomes in subjects with 22q11.2 deletion and pulmonary atresia/ventricular septal defect may be primarily related to differences in vascular anatomy and may not require additional considerations for the genetic etiology beyond that required to address the more complex anatomy. Similarly, specific anatomic features such as coronary ostial abnormalities and biventricular outflow obstruction place patients with elastin arteriopathy (including those with WBS) at risk for sudden death, requiring cautious anesthetic management.

### From karyotypes to precision genomics in 9p deletion and duplication syndromes [^f8ddf0cc]. HGG Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we present an analysis of the largest cohort of individuals with 9p deletions and duplications studied to date. We first assessed the genomic variation in this cohort to determine if there are any trends in the 9p breakpoint region and confirmed 9p22 and 9p24 as the regions with the most breakpoints, as previously described in studies seven to nine times smaller than the present study. We then assessed the genomic variations to determine if there were any trends in the chromosome arms involved in secondary structural variations. A similar investigation of structural variation patterns in other phenotypes and syndromes has proven crucial to improving clinical management and developing therapeutic applications. For example, many cases of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) are driven by a fusion protein derived from a translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 (MIM:). Importantly, identification of this variation pattern, known as "The Philadelphia Chromosome", has enabled successful targeting by clinical therapeutics (MIM:). In contrast to The Philadelphia Chromosome and CML, we found that the pattern of breakpoints and chromosome arms affected by secondary structural variants in 9p deletion and duplication syndromes is more heterogeneous. This reinforces the genetic and clinical complexities of these syndromes and the need for a precision genomics approach.

While DSDs have been reported in 9p deletion and duplication syndromes, we identify for the first time a significant gender bias in the full cohort with an enrichment for females. Among those with available sex chromosome information, we found individuals in the cohort with a gender of female and a sex chromosome complement of XY as expected in some DSDs. To make this a comprehensive study of phenotypes and genes in 9p deletion and duplication syndromes, we performed a meta-analysis of phenotypes observed in 9p deletion and duplication syndromes and found shared, similar, mirrored, and differing phenotypes. Several gene features were also considered for prioritization including constraint, enrichment for deletions/duplications in NDDs, and prior established disease associations. These are useful resources for the assessment of 9p-related structural variations. Recently developed genomic technologies are revolutionizing the way we assess syndromes with complex structural variations. We applied several of these technologies in this study to an individual with a complex 9p deletion, duplication, and associated translocation. We found that the classical karyotype is essential, that either a microarray or short-read WGS is critical to identify the mosaic duplication, and that long-read sequencing is the only technology able to resolve the intricate complexities of this variation.

### Prenatal diagnosis of 24 cases of microduplication 22q11.2: an investigation of phenotype-genotype correlations [^9e47d7eb]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Microduplication 22q11.2 is primarily characterized by a highly variable clinical phenotype, which ranges from apparently normal or slightly dysmorphic features (in the presence or absence of learning disorders) to severe malformations with profound mental retardation. Hence, genetic counseling is particularly challenging when microduplication 22q11.2 is identified in a prenatal diagnosis. Here, we report on 24 prenatal cases of microduplication 22q11.2.

Methods

Seventeen of the cases were also reanalyzed by microarray analysis, in order to determine copy number variations (CNVs, which are thought to influence expressivity). We also searched for possible correlations between fetal phenotypes, indications for invasive prenatal diagnosis, inheritance, and pregnancy outcomes.

Results

Of the 24 cases, 15 were inherited, six occurred de novo, and three were of unknown origin. Termination of pregnancy occurred in seven cases and was mainly decided on the basis of ultrasound findings. Moreover, additional CNVs were found in some patients and we try to make a genotype-phenotype correlation.

Conclusion

We discuss the complexity of genetic counseling for microduplication 22q11.2 and comment on possible explanations for the clinical heterogeneity of this syndrome. In particular, we assessed the co-existence of additional CNVs and their contribution to phenotypic variations in chromosome 22q11.2 microduplication syndrome.

### Further clinical delineation of chromosome 1q21Microduplication syndrome: robin sequence as an under-recognized association in chromosomal microdeletions and duplications [^fee79bbb]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Robin sequence (RS) has been reported in association with single gene disorders and chromosomal abnormalities; however, it has not previously been described in connection with chromosome 1q21 microduplication. We present the first known case of a neonate diagnosed with chromosome 1q21.1 microduplication syndrome and RS requiring surgical airway intervention. This case demonstrates the value of genetic testing in cases of RS presenting with other congenital anomalies.

### Tandem configurations of variably duplicated segments of 22q11.2 confirmed by fiber-FISH analysis [^897c7bb3]. Journal of Human Genetics (2011). Low credibility.

22q11.2 duplication syndrome has recently been established as a new syndrome manifesting broad clinical phenotypes including mental retardation. It is reciprocal to DiGeorge (DGS)/velo-cardio-facial syndrome (VCFS), in which the same portion of the chromosome is hemizygously deleted. Deletions and duplications of the 22q11.2 region are facilitated by the low-copy repeats (LCRs) flanking this region. In this study, we aimed to identify the directions of the duplicated segments of 22q11.2 to better understand the mechanism of chromosomal duplication. To achieve this aim, we accumulated samples from four patients with 22q11.2 duplications. One of the patients had an atypically small (741kb) duplication of 22q11.2. The centromeric end of the breakpoint was on LCR22A, but the telomeric end was between LCR22A and B. Therefore, the duplicated segment did not include T-box 1 gene (TBX1), the gene primarily responsible for the DGS/VCFS. As this duplication was shared by the patient's healthy mother, this appears to be a benign copy-number variation rather than a disease-causing alteration. The other three patients showed 3.0 or 4.0Mb duplications flanked by LCRs. The directions of the duplicated segments were investigated by fiber-fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis. All samples showed tandem configurations. These results support the hypothesized mechanism of non-allelic homologous recombination with flanking LCRs and add additional evidence that many interstitial duplications are aligned as tandem configurations.

### Practice parameter for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with schizophrenia [^a4e400f8]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2013). Medium credibility.

Children and adolescents with schizophrenia — genetic and cytogenetic findings indicate that rare deletions and duplications are enriched in individuals with schizophrenia, and structural mutations at genomic hotspots including 1q21.1, 15q13.3, and 22q11.2 may be responsible for 0.5% to 1.0% of cases. Early-onset schizophrenia (EOS) appears to be associated with a higher rate of large cytogenetic abnormalities and rare structural variants than reported in adults, and these include 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, which is associated with substantial rates of behavioral, cognitive, and psychiatric problems, including psychosis. Most rare copy number errors are found at different genetic loci and many are unique to one individual or family, suggesting most affected persons have a different genetic cause with implications for intervention and translation of research.

### D-transposition of the great arteries in a case of microduplication 22q11.2 [^9a451d93]. Pediatric Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

The 22q11.2 deletion syndrome is one of the most frequent genetic syndromes, mainly characterized by cleft palate, facial dysmorphism, conotruncal heart malformations and immune deficiencies. Microduplication of the 22q11.2 region is a quite recently characterized genetic entity comprising a variable phenotype including some overlapping features with the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. So far only few reports of patients with this microduplication and heart defects have been published. To our knowledge this is the first description of a patient with genetically confirmed duplication of the 22q11.2 region and d-transposition of the great arteries (d-TGA) as well as Ebstein's anomaly.
