## Question

Does a low iron saturation require ferrous sulfate

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a low iron saturation (transferrin saturation) requires ferrous sulfate treatment. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "low iron saturation" actually means diagnostically. Then, I should verify when iron therapy is indicated beyond just a low TSAT. Next, I will consider whether ferrous sulfate is the preferred agent and why. After that, I need to check dosing strategies and alternatives if oral iron is not tolerated or ineffective. Finally, I should confirm monitoring and special scenarios where IV iron is preferred, and then synthesize a clear answer with caveats.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't jump to conclusions: a low transferrin saturation is generally defined as less than 20 percent, and in the context of iron deficiency, TSAT below 20 percent supports the diagnosis when ferritin is low or when inflammation obscures ferritin, though ferritin remains the primary marker in most adults without inflammation [^2455baf2] [^279cff9f] [^d25c3489].

> Hold on, let's not conflate a low TSAT with a mandate to treat. I need to ensure we distinguish absolute iron deficiency from functional iron deficiency and from anemia of chronic disease, because treatment decisions hinge on that distinction. In absolute iron deficiency, TSAT is low and ferritin is low; in functional deficiency, TSAT is low but ferritin is normal or high due to inflammation, and in anemia of chronic disease, TSAT may be low with ferritin greater than 100 ng/mL, so a low TSAT alone is not sufficient to dictate therapy without corroborating labs and clinical context [^2455baf2] [^279cff9f] [^c45a97eb].

> Next, I should review whether iron therapy is indicated when TSAT is low. Let me verify: yes, when low TSAT reflects absolute iron deficiency or when it accompanies symptomatic iron deficiency or anemia, iron replacement is indicated; in heart failure, low TSAT identifies patients who benefit from IV iron, and in CKD, iron is suggested when TSAT is below 30 percent with ferritin below 500 ng/mL if hemoglobin improvement is desired, underscoring that low TSAT is a trigger to treat in these contexts [^2455baf2] [^14248845] [^300662c8].

> I will now examine whether ferrous sulfate is the preferred oral agent. Wait, let me verify guideline concordance: multiple high-credibility sources prefer ferrous sulfate as first-line oral iron because it is effective, widely available, and inexpensive; no oral formulation has proven superiority over ferrous sulfate, though some alternatives may be better tolerated in select patients [^6d6f8ec1] [^73dba1e6] [^26134a7d].

> Let me think about dosing, because I initially thought traditional three-times-daily regimens were standard; hmm, wait a minute, newer data suggest once-daily or alternate-day dosing improves absorption by avoiding hepcidin-mediated blockade from frequent dosing, so 40–60 mg elemental iron once daily or 80–100 mg every other day is reasonable, with vitamin C to enhance absorption when tolerated, and this approach balances efficacy with tolerability [^b1d847e6] [^bde6cc85] [^2bcd92de].

> But wait, what if oral iron is not appropriate or not working? I should confirm indications for IV iron: use IV iron when oral iron is not tolerated, when absorption is impaired (e.g., post-bariatric surgery, celiac disease, active IBD), when there is ongoing blood loss, in CKD or heart failure where IV iron improves outcomes, or when rapid repletion is needed; formulations like ferric carboxymaltose or iron isomaltoside can deliver 1,000 mg in one or two infusions, which is convenient and effective [^2455baf2] [^73dba1e6] [^1cef6995] [^0cfb3422].

> I should double-check monitoring so I don't miss expected responses: in absolute iron deficiency anemia, hemoglobin should rise by about 1 g/dL within 2–4 weeks of oral therapy; if there is no response, reassess adherence, absorption, ongoing blood loss, or an alternate diagnosis, and consider switching to IV iron if oral therapy fails or is not tolerated [^d926af9f] [^2455baf2].

> Let me reconsider special scenarios briefly to ensure completeness: in pregnancy, oral iron remains first-line and ferrous sulfate is acceptable across trimesters, with IV iron reserved for intolerance or late gestation when oral therapy cannot catch up; in pediatrics, low-dose ferrous sulfate is preferred and effective; in RLS, iron supplementation is suggested when ferritin is low or TSAT is below 20 percent, with IV iron favored in more severe or refractory cases [^dfb4eefc] [^ce94c7db] [^fa92b80f] [^fa2a548c].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line: a low iron saturation alone does not automatically require ferrous sulfate, but when low TSAT reflects absolute iron deficiency or is accompanied by symptoms, anemia, or conditions where iron repletion improves outcomes, then yes, ferrous sulfate is an appropriate first-line choice, typically dosed once daily or every other day with vitamin C to optimize absorption, with IV iron considered when oral therapy is not feasible or effective [^2455baf2] [^6d6f8ec1] [^73dba1e6] [^b1d847e6].

---

Not necessarily. Low iron saturation (transferrin saturation < 20%) **indicates iron deficiency** [^2455baf2] but does not automatically mean ferrous sulfate is required. Ferrous sulfate is the **first-line oral iron** [^6d6f8ec1] for most patients with iron deficiency anemia or symptomatic iron deficiency, but it is not mandatory if there is no anemia, symptoms, or if oral iron is not tolerated or absorbed [^2455baf2]. In such cases, **IV iron** [^2455baf2] or alternative oral formulations may be preferred [^73dba1e6]. Treatment should be individualized based on hemoglobin, ferritin, symptoms, and the underlying cause [^2455baf2].

---

## Definition and clinical significance of low iron saturation

Low iron saturation, or transferrin saturation (TSAT), is typically defined as **< 20%** [^2455baf2] and reflects reduced iron availability for erythropoiesis. It is a sensitive marker of iron deficiency, especially when ferritin is normal or elevated due to inflammation [^279cff9f]. Low TSAT can occur with or without anemia and may cause fatigue, impaired cognition, and reduced exercise capacity [^2455baf2].

---

## Indications for iron supplementation

Iron supplementation is indicated when low TSAT reflects **absolute iron deficiency** [^2455baf2] — low ferritin with low TSAT — or when iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is present. It is also indicated for symptomatic iron deficiency without anemia, such as fatigue or restless legs syndrome [^2455baf2] [^fa2a548c]. The goal is to restore iron stores, correct anemia, and improve symptoms [^2455baf2].

---

## Role of ferrous sulfate in iron deficiency management

Ferrous sulfate is the **most commonly used oral iron** [^6d6f8ec1] because it is effective, inexpensive, and widely available. It provides about 65 mg of elemental iron per 325 mg tablet, and typical dosing is 325 mg once daily or every other day to maximize absorption and minimize side effects [^b1d847e6] [^bde6cc85]. Ferrous sulfate is effective at correcting anemia and replenishing iron stores in most patients [^7e0a572d].

---

## Situations where ferrous sulfate may not be necessary or appropriate

Ferrous sulfate is not necessary or may be inappropriate in the following scenarios:

- **Asymptomatic low TSAT without anemia**: If hemoglobin is normal and there are no symptoms, observation and addressing the cause may suffice [^notfound].
- **Poor tolerability or absorption**: Gastrointestinal side effects (nausea, constipation, dyspepsia) are common and can limit adherence [^2bcd92de]; impaired absorption (e.g. celiac disease, post-bariatric surgery) reduces efficacy [^2455baf2].
- **Chronic inflammatory conditions**: In CKD, heart failure, or IBD, IV iron is often preferred due to impaired absorption and hepcidin-mediated iron sequestration [^2455baf2] [^73dba1e6].
- **Urgent need for iron repletion**: IV iron is preferred when rapid correction is needed (e.g. severe anemia, preoperative optimization) [^2455baf2] [^fe33838a].

---

## Alternative iron supplementation options

When ferrous sulfate is not suitable, **alternatives include**:

| **Formulation** | **Indication** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|
| Ferrous fumarate or gluconate | Oral iron intolerance | Similar efficacy; may be better tolerated [^notfound] |
| Ferric maltol | Inflammatory bowel disease | Better tolerated; less GI irritation [^notfound] |
| IV iron (ferric carboxymaltose, iron sucrose, iron isomaltoside) | - Oral intolerance <br/> - Malabsorption <br/> - Chronic disease <br/> - Rapid repletion | - Effective <br/> - Well tolerated <br/> - Single or few infusions [^2455baf2] [^0cfb3422] |

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Guidelines consistently recommend **individualized therapy** based on hemoglobin, ferritin, TSAT, symptoms, and the underlying cause [^2455baf2]. Ferrous sulfate is first-line for most patients, but IV iron is preferred when oral iron is not tolerated, not absorbed, or when rapid repletion is needed [^2455baf2] [^73dba1e6]. Regular monitoring of hemoglobin and iron indices is essential to assess response and adjust therapy [^2455baf2].

---

## Conclusion and clinical implications

Low iron saturation indicates iron deficiency but **does not mandate ferrous sulfate** [^2455baf2]. Ferrous sulfate is appropriate for many patients, but alternatives are reasonable when oral iron is not tolerated, not absorbed, or when rapid repletion is needed. Treatment should be tailored to the patient's clinical context, preferences, and response, with ongoing monitoring to ensure safe and effective correction of iron deficiency [^2455baf2].

### Oral iron supplementation: new formulations, old questions [^bba815d5]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Ferrous sulfate and other ferrous salts remain the mainstay of oral iron supplementation. Their high efficacy is offset by poor tolerability and reduced compliance, which sparked the development of alternative oral iron supplements. Recent studies with ferrous sulfate provided new insights on optimal dosage and frequency. Additional adequately powered RCT are required to address open questions on efficacy, side effects, optimal dosage and frequency of different types of oral iron supplements for selected groups of patients. As none of the old or new oral iron formulations has shown non-inferiority versus intravenous iron, comparisons against the gold standard (ferrous sulfate) would be more informative. The effects of oral iron supplements on hepcidin should also be investigated in animal models and clinical studies. Based on current knowledge, the choice between iron formulations should depend on the individual’s iron status, tolerance, absorption capacity, and specific therapeutic goals.

### Effect of ferric citrate versus ferrous sulfate on iron and phosphate parameters in patients with iron deficiency and CKD: a randomized trial [^83c74e7a]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Ferric citrate is an oral medication approved for treatment of iron deficiency anemia in patients with CKD not requiring dialysis. The relative efficacy of ferric citrate versus ferrous sulfate in treating iron deficiency in patients with CKD is unclear.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

We randomized 60 adults with moderate to severe CKD (eGFR 15-45 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 ) and iron deficiency (transferrin saturation [TSAT] ≤30% and ferritin ≤300 ng/ml) to ferric citrate (2 g three times a day with meals, n =30) or ferrous sulfate (325 mg three times a day, n =30) for 12 weeks. Primary outcomes were change in TSAT and ferritin from baseline to 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes were change in hemoglobin, fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), and hepcidin.

Results

Baseline characteristics were well balanced between study arms. There was a greater increase in TSAT (between-group difference in mean change, 8%; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1 to 15; P =0.02) and ferritin (between-group difference in mean change, 37 ng/ml; 95% CI, 10 to 64; P =0.009) from baseline to 12 weeks in participants randomized to ferric citrate as compared with ferrous sulfate. Similarly, as compared with ferrous sulfate, treatment with ferric citrate resulted in a greater increase in hepcidin from baseline to 12 weeks (between-group difference, 69 pg/ml; 95% CI, 8 to 130). There were no between-group differences in mean change for hemoglobin (0.3 g/dl; 95% CI, -0.2 to 0.8), intact FGF23 (-29 pg/ml; 95% CI, -59 to 0.1), or C-terminal FGF23 (61 RU/ml; 95% CI, -181 to 58). The incidence of adverse events did not differ between treatment arms.

Conclusions

As compared with ferrous sulfate, treatment with ferric citrate for 12 weeks resulted in a greater mean increase in TSAT and ferritin concentrations in individuals with moderate to severe CKD and iron deficiency.

### Rationale and design of the IRON-HF study: a randomized trial to assess the effects of iron supplementation in heart failure patients with anemia [^32a14e58]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Anemia is a common finding in heart failure (HF) patients and has been associated with increased morbidity and mortality. It is generally denominated as anemia of chronic disease (ACD), but the association with true ferropenic anemia is common. Many studies have investigated the effects of treating anemia in HF patients with either erythropoietin alone or combination of erythropoietin and intravenous iron. However, the effect of iron supplementation alone in HF patients with ACD, ferropenic anemia, or both is unknown.

Methods and Results

IRON-HF study is a multicenter, investigator initiated, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial that will enroll anemic HF patients with relatively preserved renal function, low transferrin saturation, low iron levels, and low to moderately elevated ferritin levels. Interventions are iron sucrose intravenously 200 mg once per week for 5 weeks, ferrous sulfate 200 mg by mouth 3 times per day for 8 weeks, or placebo. The primary objective is to assess the impact of iron supplementation (intravenously or by mouth) compared with placebo in HF patients with anemia from deficient iron availability. The primary end point is variation of peak oxygen consumption assessed by ergospirometry over 3-month follow-up. Secondary end points include functional class, brain natriuretic peptide levels, quality of life scores, left ventricular ejection fraction, adverse events, HF hospitalization, and death.

Conclusions

The results of IRON-HF should help to clarify the potential clinical impact of mild to moderate anemia correction in HF patients.

### Oral iron for patients receiving dialysis: what is the evidence? [^81dbd452]. Seminars in Dialysis (2014). Low credibility.

This review aims to summarize the available evidence of the effectiveness of oral iron in patients receiving dialysis. Four small randomized controlled trials (105 evaluated patients) compared oral iron supplements with placebo or no treatment; hemoglobin and ferritin levels did not differ significantly between groups at the end of the studies, while transferrin saturation levels fell in the placebo group in two studies. One trial (46 evaluated patients), comparing different ferrous iron preparations, found that hemoglobin levels and iron indices were maintained, but not increased. Another trial (54 evaluated patients) compared heme iron polypeptide with ferrous sulfate; hemoglobin and transferrin saturation levels remained stable with both agents, but ferritin levels fell with heme iron polypeptide, but not ferrous sulfate. Two observational studies found that iron supplements can maintain hemoglobin and iron indices. Oral iron supplements were poorly tolerated. These sparse data suggest that oral iron is of little or no benefit in raising hemoglobin and iron indices in patients receiving dialysis. Further data are required to determine if oral iron can maintain adequate iron indices following iron replenishment using intravenous iron supplements.

### Oral iron supplementation: new formulations, old questions [^7e0a572d]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

Efficacy of oral iron supplements

The bioavailability of a drug is typically assessed by measuring its serum concentration. Experimental studies with anemic patients, and non-anemic blood donorssuggested that this also applies to iron supplements, as the response to treatment correlated with increased serum iron and transferrin saturation. On the other hand, it has been argued that the dynamic nature of the transferrin pool renders a transient increase in serum iron irrelevant to the efficacy of iron supplementation.

In any case, efficacy can be effectively monitored by assessing the fraction of iron that is absorbed and incorporated into hemoglobin, and most importantly, by measuring the hemoglobin concentration response to iron supplementation. An optimal response to oral iron therapy is expected to increase hemoglobin by 2 g/dL within 3-4 weeks.A hemoglobin increase of 1 g/dL within 4 weeks is considered reasonable. Repletion of body iron stores, reflected by serum ferritin >100 μg/L often requires longer treatment.

Ferrous salts

Ferrous sulfate is the least expensive and most frequently prescribed iron formulation in many countries; thus, it is considered as the gold standard in oral iron supplementation. Ingestion of ferrous sulfate (or other ferrous salts) is expected to promote a rapid surge in serum iron and effectively increase hemoglobinization and iron stores. The use of ferrous sulfate, fumarate or gluconate is recommended as a first line treatment for IDA in adults by the current British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines.Slow-release ferrous salt supplements have performed poorly in several studies, possibly due to delayed liberation of encapsulated Fe 2+ past the duodenum and upper jejunum, where iron absorption is optimal. Hence, serious concerns have been raised on their efficacy,and their use is not recommended.

### Iron replacement therapy: do we need new guidelines? [^8157aa96]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Approximately, one-third of the world's population suffers from anemia, and at least half of these cases are because of iron deficiency. With the introduction of new intravenous iron preparations over the last decade, uncertainty has arisen when these compounds should be administered and under which circumstances oral therapy is still an appropriate and effective treatment.

Recent Findings

Numerous guidelines are available, but none go into detail about therapeutic start and end points or how iron-deficiency anemia should be best treated depending on the underlying cause of iron deficiency or in regard to concomitant underlying or additional diseases.

Summary

The study points to major issues to be considered in revisions of future guidelines for the true optimal iron replacement therapy, including how to assess the need for treatment, when to start and when to stop treatment, when to follow-up for relapse, which dosage and type of therapy should be recommended or not recommended, and if some patients should not be treated.

### Iron deficiency in adults: a review [^2455baf2]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Absolute iron deficiency, defined as low iron stores with or without anemia, affects approximately 2 billion people worldwide and 14% of adults in the US. Iron-deficiency anemia, defined as low hemoglobin due to low iron stores, affects approximately 1.2 billion people worldwide, including 10 million in the US.

Observations

Absolute iron deficiency progresses from low iron stores to iron-deficiency anemia. Individuals with nonanemic iron deficiency or iron-deficiency anemia may be asymptomatic or experience fatigue, irritability, depression, difficulty concentrating, restless legs syndrome (32%-40%), pica (40%-50%), dyspnea, lightheadedness, exercise intolerance, and worsening heart failure (HF). Symptom prevalences vary depending on age, comorbidities (eg, chronic kidney disease [CKD], HF), and severity and rate of development of iron deficiency. The most common causes of iron deficiency are bleeding (menstrual, gastrointestinal), impaired iron absorption (atrophic gastritis, celiac disease, bariatric surgical procedures), inadequate dietary iron intake, and pregnancy. In high-income countries, approximately 38% of nonpregnant, reproductive-age women have iron deficiency without anemia and about 13% have iron-deficiency anemia. During the third trimester of pregnancy, iron deficiency affects up to 84% of pregnant women, based on data from high-income countries. Additional risk factors include use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD [13%-90%]), and other chronic inflammatory conditions, such as CKD (24%-85%), HF (37%-61%), and cancer (18%-82%). Testing for iron deficiency is indicated for patients with anemia and/or symptoms of iron deficiency (fatigue, pica, or restless legs syndrome) and should be considered for those with risk factors such as heavy menstrual bleeding, pregnancy, or IBD. Iron deficiency is diagnosed by low serum ferritin (typically <30 ng/mL) in individuals without inflammatory conditions or by transferrin saturation (iron/total iron binding capacity×100) less than 20%. Causes of iron deficiency should be identified and treated. Oral iron (ferrous sulfate 325 mg/d or on alternate days) is typically first-line therapy. Intravenous iron is indicated for patients with oral iron intolerance, poor absorption (celiac disease, post-bariatric surgical procedure), chronic inflammatory conditions (CKD, HF, IBD, cancer), ongoing blood loss, and during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy.

Conclusions and Relevance

Iron deficiency and iron-deficiency anemia are common conditions that may cause symptoms such as fatigue, exercise intolerance, and difficulty concentrating. Ferritin and/or transferrin saturation are required for diagnosis and screening. Oral iron is first-line therapy for most patients. Intravenous iron is used for individuals who do not tolerate or have impaired absorption of oral iron, those with ongoing blood loss, certain chronic inflammatory conditions (IBD, CKD, HF, cancer), and during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of iron deficiency anemia: expert review [^73dba1e6]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Update on management of iron deficiency anemia—best practice advice includes: No single formulation of oral iron has any advantages over any other. Ferrous sulfate is preferred as the least expensive iron formulation. Give oral iron once a day at most. Every-other-day iron dosing may be better tolerated for some patients with similar or equal rates of iron absorption as daily dosing. Add vitamin C to oral iron supplementation to improve absorption. Intravenous iron should be used if the patient does not tolerate oral iron, ferritin levels do not improve with a trial of oral iron, or the patient has a condition in which oral iron is not likely to be absorbed. Intravenous iron formulations that can replace iron deficits with 1 or 2 infusions are preferred over those that require more than 2 infusions. All intravenous iron formulations have similar risks; true anaphylaxis is very rare. The vast majority of reactions to intravenous iron are complement activation–related pseudo-allergy (infusion reactions) and should be treated as such. Intravenous iron therapy should be used in individuals who have undergone bariatric procedures, particularly those that are likely to disrupt normal duodenal iron absorption, and have iron-deficiency anemia with no identifiable source of chronic gastrointestinal blood loss.

### Iron deficiency anaemia revisited [^82eb6e84]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency anaemia is a global health concern affecting children, women and the elderly, whilst also being a common comorbidity in multiple medical conditions. The aetiology is variable and attributed to several risk factors decreasing iron intake and absorption or increasing demand and loss, with multiple aetiologies often coexisting in an individual patient. Although presenting symptoms may be nonspecific, there is emerging evidence on the detrimental effects of iron deficiency anaemia on clinical outcomes across several medical conditions. Increased awareness about the consequences and prevalence of iron deficiency anaemia can aid early detection and management. Diagnosis can be easily made by measurement of haemoglobin and serum ferritin levels, whilst in chronic inflammatory conditions, diagnosis may be more challenging and necessitates consideration of higher serum ferritin thresholds and evaluation of transferrin saturation. Oral and intravenous formulations of iron supplementation are available, and several patient and disease-related factors need to be considered before management decisions are made. This review provides recent updates and guidance on the diagnosis and management of iron deficiency anaemia in multiple clinical settings.

### Oral ferrous sulfate does not increase preoperative hemoglobin in patients scheduled for hip or knee arthroplasty [^48720a30]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Low hemoglobin (Hb) concentrations before lower limb joint replacement are associated with the need for blood transfusions and increased mortality. To optimize preoperative Hb, blood conservation protocols often recommend oral iron supplements, even in nonanemic patients.

Objective

To investigate the impact of ferrous sulfate on the change in Hb prior to hip or knee arthroplasty and evaluate the effect of oral iron on hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), ferritin, and transferrin saturation, as well as its tolerability and treatment adherence.

Methods

We conducted a prospective, observational cohort study of adults with Hb concentrations between 10 and 15 g/dL who received iron supplementation prior to hip or knee arthroplasty. Systemic inflammatory diseases, vitamin B(12) or folate deficiency, and current use of iron supplements, intravenous iron, or erythropoietin were exclusion criteria. All participants were prescribed ferrous sulfate 300 mg 3 times daily for a minimum of 3 weeks. Complete blood cell counts and iron studies were performed before therapy and surgery.

Results

Eighty-seven patients with a mean (SD) Hb of 13.47 (0.84) g/dL were included in the study. Preoperative Hb decreased after treatment with iron (-0.14 [0.53] g/dL, p = 0.015). Hematocrit also declined (-0.6% [1.8%], p = 0.002), whereas ferritin increased (25.8 [38.6] ng/mL, p < 0.001). No significant change was seen in MCV and transferrin saturation. The most common adverse effects were constipation (33.3%), heartburn (13.8%), and abdominal pain (12.6%). The adherence rate was 67.1%.

Conclusions

Oral ferrous sulfate supplementation is not an effective method to increase preoperative Hb in patients scheduled for hip or knee arthroplasty, and its use is associated with adverse effects.

### Treatment of restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movement disorder: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^fa2a548c]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Restless legs syndrome (RLS) iron therapy—IV ferric carboxymaltose receives a strong recommendation for adults in this CPG, and routine screening of iron indices is an essential component of RLS patient care. Other IV iron formulations are not suggested for RLS due to less robust evidence for each comparison; nevertheless, 1 RCT using IV iron sucrose did show efficacy in adults with RLS and ESRD with a transferrin saturation < 20%, and this form of IV iron is conditionally recommended. Oral iron supplementation with ferrous sulfate is suggested with a conditional recommendation based on limited RCT data.

### Anemia in pregnancy: ACOG practice bulletin, number 233 [^dfb4eefc]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

Regarding the use of ferrous sulfate PO in pregnant patients for all trimesters: generally acceptable for use. Maternal anemia increases the risk of low birth weight, premature delivery, and impaired cognitive and behavioral development. The ACOG recommends screening all pregnant women for anemia with a CBC in the first trimester and again at 24-28 weeks of gestation. The ACOG recommends low-dose iron supplementation starting in the first trimester to reduce the prevalence of maternal anemia at delivery. Oral iron preparations are the preferred first-line treatment for iron deficiency in pregancy.

Regarding medical management for restless legs syndrome, more specifically with respect to iron supplementation, AASM 2025 guidelines recommend to consider initiating iron supplementation with the following oral or IV iron preparations in adult patients with RLS with serum ferritin ≤ 75 ng/mL or transferrin saturation < 20%, and only with IV iron if serum ferritin is 75-100 ng/mL:

- IV ferric carboxymaltose

- IV low molecular weight

- IV ferumoxytol

- ferrous sulfate

### Iron deficiency anemia: evaluation and management [^d926af9f]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency anemia is common worldwide. In adult patients without inflammation, a ferritin level of less than 45 ng/mL or ferritin level of 46 to 99 ng/mL plus a transferrin saturation of less than 20% is diagnostic of iron deficiency. In patients with inflammation, a ferritin level of less than 100 ng/mL is diagnostic. Risk factors for iron deficiency anemia include low socioeconomic status, female sex, age younger than 5 years, and chronic inflammation. Underlying causes should be investigated. Recurrent blood loss is responsible for 94% of cases. In younger patients with a plausible cause of iron deficiency anemia (eg, heavy menstrual bleeding), a reasonable approach is to treat the bleeding and provide iron supplementation. In men and postmenopausal women, bidirectional endoscopy should be performed. Noninvasive testing for Helicobacter pylori infection and celiac disease is recommended because both are common causes of iron deficiency anemia. Oral iron replacement is the first-line treatment for most patients. However, intravenous iron is recommended in patients with heart failure to increase exercise capacity. Every-other-day dosing of oral iron improves absorption. Approximately 50% of patients have decreased adherence due to adverse effects. Patients taking oral iron therapy should be evaluated for response in 2 to 4 weeks. Patients who cannot tolerate oral iron or do not have adequate response should receive intravenous iron. Hypersensitivity to newer formulations of intravenous iron is rare (less than 1%).

Regarding specific circumstances for iron deficiency anemia, more specifically with respect to patients undergoing surgery (thresholds), BSH 2024 guidelines recommend to view ferritin levels of 30-100 mcg/L with a low transferrin saturation (< 20%) as indicative of possible iron depletion or deficiency in the context of inflammation that may benefit from iron supplementation.

According to the current evidence, it is recommended to optimize the available iron stores with IV iron before or during therapy with ESA [-] (Table 2).

Table 2 
Overview of the available studies with IV iron in combination with ESA. Hematopoietic response was defined as Hb increase ≥2 g/dL, Hb ≥11g/dL, Hb ≥12 g/dL or Hb ≥13 g/dL in the different studies

In contrast to studies mentioned in Table 2, Steensma et al did not find any difference in hematopoietic response rate, ESA dose requirements, transfusion needs, and QoL in 502 patients receiving darbepoetin every 3 weeks randomized to the combination with oral placebo, oral ferrous sulfate 325 mg per day and ferric gluconate 187.5 mg every 3 weeks. The negative results might be explained by the low dose of ferric gluconate, which was about 50% of the recommended single dose.

Overall, the available studies are heterogeneous in study design (different oncologic profiles, different iron formulations, different prevalence in ID and different endpoints), which makes the generalization of the results complicated. In general, there is compelling evidence that the response to ESA is better when IV iron is added.

IV iron as monotherapy

A body of evidence shows that IV administration of iron routinely in absence of ESA is favorable. Kim et al showed in cervical cancer patients treated with chemoradiotherapy that giving iron sucrose every chemotherapy cycle reduces the need for transfusion (40% vs. 64% of the patients, and fewer units needed: 1.87 vs. 3.58 units). Dangsuwan showed a significant reduction in transfusion need in the next chemotherapy cycle by giving iron sucrose in comparison to oral iron (22.7% vs. 63.6%).

A large German prospective, non-interventional 12-week study showed that patients with baseline Hb up to 11.0 g/dL and serum ferritin up to 500 ng/mL benefited from FCM treatment (stable Hb ≥11.0 g/dL). Also patients with ferritin >500 ng/mL but low transferrin saturation benefited from FCM treatment. FCM was well tolerated, 2.3% of patients reported putative drug-related adverse events.

### Should serum transferrin saturation Be included as a therapeutic target in addition to serum ferritin in treating HFE-hemochromatosis? [^58fc2d1d]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

In HFE-hemochromatosis, transferrin saturation (TSAT) indirectly reflects plasma non-transferrin-bound iron (NTBI), which drives iron overload and tissue damage. TSAT above ~75% suggests harmful NTBI levels. Despite its clinical relevance, NTBI remains understudied due to the limitations of current assays. High TSAT levels persist during maintenance therapy, yet some guidelines omit TSAT monitoring, though it correlates with symptoms like fatigue and joint pain. Monitoring TSAT may improve outcomes. Randomized trials comparing ferritin-only versus ferritin-plus-TSAT-guided treatment are needed. Consideration should be given to approaches that minimize plasma NTBI in managing and monitoring patients with hemochromatosis. Until reliable NTBI testing has been established, TSAT should be included in the management of HFE-hemochromatosis.

Recommendation 4: Avoid packed red blood cell transfusion for asymptomatic children with IDA and no active bleeding.

The fourth ASH-ASPHO recommendation advises against the transfusion of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) in asymptomatic children with iron deficiency anemia (IDA) with no evidence of hemodynamic instability or active bleeding. IDA is the most common cause of anemia across all age groups, and it affects 2 billion individuals worldwide, including 2 million in the United States.IDA usually develops over time (ie, chronic process), and most patients are asymptomatic, even those with very low hemoglobin.The 2 key steps in managing IDA in children are (1) initiating iron replacement therapy by oral or intravenous routes, which usually leads to a rapid increase in hemoglobin levelsand (2) treating the underlying etiologies (eg, restricting excessive cow’s milk intake for toddlers or starting hormonal contraceptive therapy for adolescents with heavy menstrual bleeding).Ferrous sulfate is a frequently prescribed oral iron formulation divided into 2 or 3 daily doses,or as a low-dose once-per-day regimen.Often ferrous sulfate is poorly tolerated because of adverse gastrointestinal effects.Furthermore, there has been growing evidence to support the utility and the benefits of using alternate-day oral iron supplementation among adults with IDA, especially women.Several studies, including recent randomized controlled trials, reported evidence to suggest comparable hemoglobin response with higher fractional iron absorption and better tolerability using an alternate-day regimen compared with a twice-per-day regimen; there are no similar data in the current literature on pediatric IDA, and future studies are needed to address this research question. Recent studies have also reported data supporting the safety and efficacy of intravenous iron replacement in children and teenswho have demonstrated a poor response to oral iron formulations.

### Oral iron supplementation: new formulations, old questions [^26330393]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

Iron-deficiency anemia and pre-anemic iron deficiency are the most frequent pathologies. The first line of treatment involves oral iron supplementation. The simplest, least expensive, and most commonly prescribed drug is ferrous sulfate, while other ferrous salts and ferric complexes with polysaccharides or succinylated milk proteins are also widely used. In recent years, novel iron formulations have been developed, such as the lipophilic iron donor ferric maltol, or nanoparticle encapsulated sucrosomial ® iron. Oral iron supplementation is usually efficacious in correcting iron-deficiency anemia and replenishing iron stores but causes gastrointestinal side effects that reduce compliance. When oral iron supplementation is contraindicated, intravenous iron therapy can rapidly achieve therapeutic targets without gastrointestinal complications. Herein, we critically review literature on relative efficacy and tolerability of currently available oral iron supplements, and summarize recent data on optimal dosage and frequency.

### Iron supplementation does not worsen respiratory health or alter the sputum microbiome in cystic fibrosis [^eedf50d0]. Journal of Cystic Fibrosis (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Iron supplementation for hypoferremic anemia could potentiate bacterial growth in the cystic fibrosis (CF) lung, but clinical trials testing this hypothesis are lacking.

Methods

Twenty-two adults with CF and hypoferremic anemia participated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial of ferrous sulfate 325mg daily for 6weeks. Iron-related hematologic parameters, anthropometric data, sputum iron, Akron Pulmonary Exacerbation Score (PES), and the sputum microbiome were serially assessed. Fixed-effect models were used to describe how ferrous sulfate affected these variables.

Results

Ferrous sulfate increased serum iron by 22.3% and transferrin saturation (TSAT) by 26.8% from baseline (p<0.05) but did not affect hemoglobin, sputum iron, Akron PES, and the sputum microbiome.

Conclusions

Low-dose ferrous sulfate improved hypoferremia without correcting anemia after 6weeks. We did not observe significant effects on sputum iron, Akron PES, and the sputum microbiome. Although we did not identify untoward health effects of iron supplementation, a larger blinded randomized controlled trial would be needed to fully demonstrate safety.

### The efficacy and safety of vitamin C for iron supplementation in adult patients with iron deficiency anemia: a randomized clinical trial [^109e4801]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is associated with a decrease in erythropoiesis caused by a deficit in total body iron.Iron deficiency is the leading cause of anemia worldwide. According to the World Health Organization guideline,IDA affects 30% of the world’s population, indicating that it is a problem requiring attention.

Iron deficiency can be divided into 3 stages: prelatent iron deficiency, latent iron deficiency (also called iron-deficient erythropoiesis), and iron deficiency anemia (IDA). At the first stage, iron intake lower than the required amount causes progressive depletion of iron storage primarily in the liver and muscle cells. Patients at this stage generally have no symptoms, and the diagnosis of iron deficiency is made when levels of serum ferritin (the storage form of iron) decrease below 20 ng/mL (to convert to micrograms per liter, multiply by 1.0). Sustained iron storage depletion leads to the second stage of iron deficiency, iron-deficient erythropoiesis, in which iron deficiencies progress and begin to affect erythropoiesis. Despite an increased transferrin level, serum iron level decreases along with transferrin saturation. Erythropoiesis impairment appears when the serum iron level decreases to less than 50.3 μg/dL (to convert to micromoles per liter, multiply by 0.179) and transferrin saturation is less than 16%.Hemoglobin level is still within the normal range until the development of the IDA stage. Iron storage levels deplete to the point that they can no longer support the hemoglobin production and generate enough red blood cells (RBCs). Iron deficiency impairs RBC synthesis and hemoglobin production, leading to anemia.

### How we diagnose and treat iron deficiency anemia [^a04bc3d2]. American Journal of Hematology (2016). Low credibility.

It is estimated that one-third of the world's population is anemic, the majority being due to iron deficiency (ID). In adults, ID is associated with fatigue in the absence of anemia, restless legs syndrome, pica and, in neonates, delayed growth and development. In adolescents, ID is associated with decrements in learning and behavioral abnormalities. In the absence of a clear cause, search for a source of bleeding is indicated. No single test is diagnostic of ID unless the serum ferritin is low or the percent transferrin saturation is low with an elevated total iron binding capacity. Oral iron is considered front line therapy except for conditions such as gastric bypass, heavy uterine bleeding, inflammatory bowel disease, and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Oral iron has many unpleasant side effects, resulting in low patient adherence. For patients intolerant of, or unresponsive to, oral iron, intravenous (IV) administration is the preferred route. While early formulations were associated with a high incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs), newer formulations are much safer with SAEs occurring very infrequently. Full replacement doses can be administered in a matter of minutes to a few hours. Nevertheless, there remains a reluctance to use IV iron due to a misunderstanding of the safety of the available formulations. IV iron is safe and effective in all clinical circumstances including pregnancy. The preponderance of published evidence suggests IV iron therapy is underutilized and we believe that IV iron should be moved forward in the treatment of ID and iron deficiency anemia (IDA).

A 78-year-old man was referred from his primary care clinic to the emergency department due to bluish discolouration of his lips and decreased oxygen saturation on pulse oximetry. The patient was asymptomatic. Physical exam was normal except for lip cyanosis. A CT pulmonary angiogram was negative for pulmonary embolism. Arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis with co-oximetry showed low oxyhaemoglobin, normal partial pressure of oxygen and methaemoglobinaemia, but an unexplained 'gap' in total haemoglobin saturation. This gap was felt to be due to sulfhaemoglobinaemia. After a thorough review of his medications, ferrous sulfate was stopped which resulted in resolution in patient's cyanosis and normalisation of his ABG after 7 weeks.

Treatment of IDA

17. We recommend that IRT should not be deferred while awaiting investigations for IDA unless colonoscopy is imminent (evidence quality—high, consensus—100%, statement strength—strong).

18. We recommend that the initial treatment of IDA should be with one tablet per day of ferrous sulphate, fumarate or gluconate. If not tolerated, a reduced dose of one tablet every other day, alternative oral preparations or parenteral iron should be considered (evidence quality—medium, consensus—92%, statement strength—strong).

19. Limited transfusion of packed red cells may on occasion be required to treat symptomatic IDA, in which case IRT is still necessary post-transfusion (evidence quality—high, consensus—100%, statement strength—strong).

20. We recommend that patients should be monitored in the first 4 weeks for an Hb response to oral iron, and treatment should be continued for a period of around 3 months after normalisation of the Hb level, to ensure adequate repletion of the marrow iron stores (evidence quality—medium, consensus—92%, statement strength—strong).

21. We recommend that parenteral iron should be considered when oral iron is contraindicated, ineffective or not tolerated. This consideration should be at any early stage if oral IRT is judged unlikely to be effective (see text), and/or the correction of IDA is particularly urgent (evidence quality—high, consensus—92%, statement strength—strong).

22. There is insufficient evidence to support invasive investigation in non-anaemic iron deficiency unless there are additional indications (see text), but periodic blood count monitoring is suggested (evidence quality-low, consensus-92%, statement strength-weak).

23. After the restoration of Hb and iron stores with IRT, we recommend that the blood count should be monitored periodically (perhaps every 6 months initially) to detect recurrent IDA (evidence quality—very low, consensus—85%, statement strength—strong).

The treatment of iron deficiency aims to (i) restore normal circulating Hb levels, (ii) replenish body iron stores, (iii) improve quality of life and (iv) improve physiological function. Successful IRT should achieve all of these outcomes.An algorithm providing an overview of the treatment of IDA is shown in figure 3, and the elements of this are discussed in more detail below.

Non-ID anemia in IBD patients

As described above, there are several additional important causes of Hb deprivation in patients with IBD. Especially in cases of macrocytic anemia, vitamin B12 and folic acid level measurements should be performed during screening visits. Additionally, myelosuppressive medication, including thiopurines and sulfasalazine, should always be considered in the diagnostic workup of anemia.

Treatment of anemia in IBD

Given that anemia significantly affects patients’ QOL and increases disease severity and mortality rates, therapeutic interventions aiming to normalize Hb levels play a crucial part in the clinical management of IBD patients. Physicians should be aware of anemia in IBD patients and should treat the underlying causes.

Iron therapy in IBD

Recent guidelines strongly recommend iron supplementation in patients with confirmed ID anemia. The normalization of Hb levels and repletion of iron stores are considered as final therapeutic goals. More specifically, a Hb increase of >2 g/dL and a transferrin saturation of >30% within 4 weeks are regarded as adequate therapeutic responses. Iron supplementation in IBD patients without manifest anemia is still debated and should be further evaluated in clinical trials, especially with regard to tolerance of therapy.

Normal diets usually provide sufficient iron supplies in the form of elemental and heme iron. As already discussed, in patients with active IBD, the inflammation of the mucosa leads to maldigestion, malabsorption and changing nutrition habits, which may aggravate ID and make exclusive nutritional supplementation impossible. Nevertheless, oral iron substitution can be effective in IBD patients with mild disease activity and mild anemia. For reasons of widespread availability, low cost and established safety profile, many physicians tend to favor oral iron substitution as first-line therapy. Frequently used oral iron supplements are ferrous fumarate (325 mg tablets containing 106 mg elemental iron per tablet), ferrous sulfate (325 mg tablets containing 65 mg elemental iron per tablet), and ferrous gluconate (325 mg tablets containing 36 mg elemental iron per tablet).

### Individualized treatment for iron-deficiency anemia in adults [^a244ba44]. The American Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency is one of the most common disorders affecting humans, and iron-deficiency anemia continues to represent a major public health problem worldwide. It is especially common among women of childbearing age because of pregnancy and menstrual blood loss. Additional patient groups include those with other sources of blood loss, malnutrition, or gut malabsorption. Iron-deficiency anemia remains prevalent despite the widespread ability to diagnose the disease and availability of medicinal iron preparations. Therefore, new approaches are needed to effectively manage these patient populations. In this review, the diagnosis and treatment of iron-deficiency anemia are discussed with emphasis placed on consideration of patient-specific features. It is proposed that all patients participate in their own care by helping their physician to identify a tolerable daily iron dose, formulation, and schedule. Dosing cycles are recommended for iron replacement based on the tolerated daily dose and the total iron deficit. Each cycle consists of 5000 mg of oral elemental iron ingested over at least 1 month with appropriate follow-up. This approach should assist physicians and their patients with the implementation of individualized treatment strategies for patients with iron-deficiency anemia.

### Use of a probiotic to enhance iron absorption in a randomized trial of pediatric patients presenting with iron deficiency [^224ea66d]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy of low dose ferrous sulfate for the treatment of iron deficiency and if the probiotic Lactobacillus plantarum 299v (LP299v) enhances treatment.

Study Design

This randomized, double-blinded, controlled trial of the treatment of iron deficiency in children compared the use of low-dose ferrous sulfate (1-3 mg/kg/day), with or without probiotic (LP299v).

Results

Serum ferritin level increased in all children from a baseline of 23.7 ng/mL to 45.4 ng/mL after 6-8 weeks of treatment. There was no significant difference in the increase in serum ferritin in children taking the probiotic LP299v compared with controls (23.2 vs 20.0 ng/mL, respectively). Additionally, an increase in ferritin level was not significantly associated with probiotic use when controlling for other factors, including child weight and dosing. Overall, the treatments were well-tolerated, with mild side effects.

Conclusions

Treatment with low-dose ferrous sulfate is well-tolerated and effective in correcting iron deficiency in children. However, the probiotic LP299v did not enhance treatment. Further attention should examine the dose-response effect in children, including an alternate day dosing schedule.

### Iron deficiency anemia: evaluation and management [^8b511868]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency is the most common nutritional disorder worldwide and accounts for approximately one-half of anemia cases. The diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia is confirmed by the findings of low iron stores and a hemoglobin level two standard deviations below normal. Women should be screened during pregnancy, and children screened at one year of age. Supplemental iron may be given initially, followed by further workup if the patient is not responsive to therapy. Men and postmenopausal women should not be screened, but should be evaluated with gastrointestinal endoscopy if diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia. The underlying cause should be treated, and oral iron therapy can be initiated to replenish iron stores. Parenteral therapy may be used in patients who cannot tolerate or absorb oral preparations.

Description

In this Clinical Practice Update (CPU), we will Best Practice Advice (BPA) guidance on the appropriate management of iron deficiency anemia.

Methods

This expert review was commissioned and approved by the AGA Institute Clinical Practice Updates Committee (CPUC) and the AGA Governing Board to provide timely guidance on a topic of high clinical importance to the AGA membership, and underwent internal peer review by the CPUC and external peer review through standard procedures of Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology. These Best Practice Advice (BPA) statements were drawn from a review of the published literature and from expert opinion. Since systematic reviews were not performed, these BPA statements do not carry formal ratings regarding the quality of evidence or strength of the presented considerations. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 1: No single formulation of oral iron has any advantages over any other. Ferrous sulfate is preferred as the least expensive iron formulation. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 2: Give oral iron once a day at most. Every-other-day iron dosing may be better tolerated for some patients with similar or equal rates of iron absorption as daily dosing. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 3: Add vitamin C to oral iron supplementation to improve absorption. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 4: Intravenous iron should be used if the patient does not tolerate oral iron, ferritin levels do not improve with a trial of oral iron, or the patient has a condition in which oral iron is not likely to be absorbed. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 5: Intravenous iron formulations that can replace iron deficits with 1 or 2 infusions are preferred over those that require more than 2 infusions. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 6: All intravenous iron formulations have similar risks; true anaphylaxis is very rare. The vast majority of reactions to intravenous iron are complement activation-related pseudo-allergy (infusion reactions) and should be treated as such. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 7: Intravenous iron therapy should be used in individuals who have undergone bariatric procedures, particularly those that are likely to disrupt normal duodenal iron absorption, and have iron-deficiency anemia with no identifiable source of chronic gastrointestinal blood loss. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 8: In individuals with inflammatory bowel disease and iron-deficiency anemia, clinicians first should determine whether iron-deficiency anemia is owing to inadequate intake or absorption, or loss of iron, typically from gastrointestinal bleeding. Active inflammation should be treated effectively to enhance iron absorption or reduce iron depletion. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 9: Intravenous iron therapy should be given in individuals with inflammatory bowel disease, iron-deficiency anemia, and active inflammation with compromised absorption. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 10: In individuals with portal hypertensive gastropathy and iron-deficiency anemia, oral iron supplements initially should be used to replenish iron stores. Intravenous iron therapy should be used in patients with ongoing bleeding who do not respond to oral iron therapy. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 11: In individuals with portal hypertensive gastropathy and iron-deficiency anemia without another identified source of chronic blood loss, treatment of portal hypertension with nonselective β-blockers can be considered. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 12: In individuals with iron-deficiency anemia secondary to gastric antral vascular ectasia who have an inadequate response to iron replacement, consider endoscopic therapy with endoscopic band ligation or thermal methods such as argon plasma coagulation. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 13: In patients with iron-deficiency anemia and celiac disease, ensure adherence to a gluten-free diet to improve iron absorption. Consider oral iron supplementation based on the severity of iron deficiency and patient tolerance, followed by intravenous iron therapy if iron stores do not improve. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 14: Deep enteroscopy performed in patients with iron-deficiency anemia suspected to have small-bowel bleeding angioectasias should be performed with a distal attachment to improve detection and facilitate treatment. Small-bowel angioectasias may be treated with ablative thermal therapies such as argon plasma coagulation or with mechanical methods such as hemostatic clips. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 15: Endoscopic treatment of angioectasias should be accompanied with iron replacement. Medical therapy for small-bowel angioectasias should be reserved for compassionate treatment in refractory cases when iron replacement and endoscopic therapy are ineffective.

Executive summary of recommendations and practice statements

Background

Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is common, and a major cause of morbidity worldwide (evidence quality—high, consensus—100%, statement strength—strong).
IDA can be caused by a range of GI pathologies including cancer, and so GI investigation on an urgent basis should be considered in adults with a new diagnosis of IDA without obvious explanation (evidence quality—high, consensus—85%, statement strength—strong).

Definitions

We recommend that anaemia is defined as a haemoglobin (Hb) concentration below the lower limit of normal for the relevant population and laboratory performing the test (evidence quality—medium, consensus—100%, statement strength—strong).
We recommend that iron deficiency should be confirmed by iron studies prior to investigation. Serum ferritin is the single most useful marker of IDA, but other blood tests (eg, transferrin saturation) can be helpful if a false-normal ferritin is suspected (evidence quality—medium, consensus—92%, statement strength—strong).
We recommend that a good response to iron therapy (Hb rise ≥10 g/L within a 2-week timeframe) in anaemic patients is highly suggestive of absolute iron deficiency, even if the results of iron studies are equivocal (evidence quality—medium, consensus—100%, statement strength—strong).

### Updates in the management of iron deficiency anemia-AAFP (...) [^6742d215]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency results from reduced iron intake, absorption, losses or reduced mobilization of iron from bodily stores. Effects of iron deficiency anemia include reduced cognition in children and older adults, as well as adverse pregnancy outcomes. The diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia is generally based on deficient iron stores and anemia. A serum ferritin level of < 45 mg/dL is indicative of iron deficiency, demonstrating an 85% sensitivity and 92% specificity for diagnosing iron deficiency in patients with anemia. This threshold is recommended by the American Gastroenterological Association. In patients with an elevated serum ferritin due to inflammation, alternative markers of iron status such as transferrin saturation may be considered. In adults, evaluation of iron deficiency anemia involves noninvasive screening for celiac disease and. In children, mild iron deficiency anemia may be treated initially with oral iron supplementation for 1 month without additional testing.

As in adults, an increase of greater than 1. 0 g/dL of hemoglobin over 1 month is considered supportive of the diagnosis. In those who do not respond to empiric treatment, further evaluation for gastrointestinal bleeding and referral to a gastroenterologist is recommended. According to a recent AGA Clinical Practice Update, ferrous sulfate is the preferred form of iron replacement due to its affordability. However, the guidelines indicate that no specific form of iron supplementation has demonstrated superior effectiveness. Several studies have demonstrated the improved tolerability of __iron bisglycinate__ compared with ferrous sulfate, noting fewer gastrointestinal adverse effects and similar effectiveness in adults and children. The cost of iron bisglycinate supplementation is about $15 for 60 tablets vs $10 for 200 tablets of iron sulfate, making it a little more expensive. Additionally, availability in pharmacies may vary.

Intravenous iron replacement is typically recommended by the AGA updated guidelines for patients who cannot tolerate oral iron, exhibit poor absorption, or fail to demonstrate improvement with oral iron supplementation. Compared with oral iron, IV iron does not reduce mortality or the need for blood transfusions in adults with iron deficiency anemia, and it may increase the risk of infection, according to a 2022 FPIN Clinical Inquiry.

ANEMIA MANAGEMENT

The first step in the management of anemia is evaluating the underlying cause. (See above on diagnosis and evaluation.) If absolute iron deficiency is present, the patient should be put on oral or intravenous iron therapy. Several oral iron preparations are available for treatment including ferrous gluconate, fumarate, and sulfate. Doses of 300–325 mg of one of these agents three times daily can increase the Hb level significantly in such patients. Notably, significant gastrointestinal side effects may lead to poor adherence and compliance with oral iron. An alternative is to administer intravenous iron on a periodic basis. Several studies indicate that these preparations are effective and safe in predialysis populations. Dahdah et al. administered intravenous iron dextran to anemic, iron-deficient (serum ferritin <100 ng/ml or transferrin saturation <20%) patients with an estimated GFR <50 ml/min and not on dialysis in doses of either 200 mg/week for 5 weeks or 500 mg/week for 2 weeks. Significant increases in Hb occurred within 2 weeks; all patients tolerated infusions without serious adverse reactions. Intravenous iron preparations including ferric sodium gluconate, iron sucrose, and iron dextran are available and can be administered safely. Among these agents, iron dextran has been associated with the highest incidence of adverse reactions, although the incidence of such reactions is low with all three preparations. Although some studies indicate that intravenous iron is in general more efficacious than oral iron for achieving increases in Hb in patients with CKD, oral iron is also effective. Moreover, no definite advantages have been shown with intravenous versus oral iron in patients with CKD not on dialysis.

Conventional oral iron formulations

The British Society of Gastroenterology recommends ferrous preparations, specifically ferrous sulphate, as first-line therapy for iron replenishment as they are cheap, have good bioavailability, available in multiple preparations and have been shown to replenish iron stores and correct anaemia effectively.However, there are also many limitations to their use, with the most common being the frequency and severity of side effects. A systematic review demonstrated that GI side effects were the most problematic with constipation being the most frequent complaint, followed by nausea and diarrhoea.This will have a resultant effect on patient adherence, likely leading to cessation and, thus, inadequate treatment.

The appropriate dosing of ferrous iron preparations is also a contentious issue between clinicians. To adequately replenish iron stores, therapeutic treatment of IDA was initially felt to require 200 mg of iron sulphate 2–3 times per day in order to raise Hb by 20 g/L over a 4-week period, with treatment continuing for 3 months.However, the daily doses of elemental iron should not be greater than 100 mg/dayas the body can only absorb 10–20 mg of iron per day.It should be noted that 200 mg of ferrous sulphate is equivalent to 65 mg of elemental iron.

A recent study compared oral iron dosing regimens in women with mild anaemia with divided daily, once daily and alternate-day dosing. The results demonstrated superiority with alternate-day dosing, with 33% greater fractional iron absorption over 14 doses.In addition, a randomised trial of elderly patients with IDA received 15 mg, 50 mg or 150 mg of elemental iron per day. After 2 months, the mean increase in Hb was the same in all groups (1.4 g/dL); however, adverse effects were significantly greater with higher doses.It is, therefore, an evolving view that a single daily dose (40–60 mg) or a slightly higher alternate-day dose (80–100 mg) is the preferred dosing regimen in order to reduce the side effects and optimise the proportion of elemental iron absorbed.

### Randomised open-label trial comparing intravenous iron and an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent versus oral iron to treat preoperative anaemia in cardiac surgery (INITIATE trial) [^fe33838a]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Preoperative anaemia is a risk factor for adverse postoperative outcomes after cardiac surgery. Iron deficiency is a frequent cause of low preoperative haemoglobin. An effective treatment for preoperative anaemia associated with iron deficiency has not been determined.

Methods

We conducted a single-centre, open-label, pragmatic randomised trial, enrolling 156 elective cardiac surgery patients who had low preoperative haemoglobin (100-130 g L -1 ) with iron deficiency (serum ferritin <100 μg L -1 or transferrin saturation <30%) to compare intravenous ferric derisomaltose 1000 mg and darbepoetin 200 μg subcutaneously (intervention group) with oral ferrous sulphate 600 mg daily (control group). The primary outcome was transfusion of at least one unit of allogeneic red cells during surgery and within the following 5 days. Secondary outcomes included the change in haemoglobin concentration between randomisation and surgery, red cell transfusion volume, postoperative blood loss, pre-specified postoperative complications, length of hospital stay, and in-hospital death.

Results

The odds of red cell transfusion were lower in the intervention group compared with the control group (adjusted odds ratio=0.33; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.15-0.75; P=0.008). Of the secondary outcomes, the only significant difference was the increase in haemoglobin between randomisation and surgery, intervention vs control 9.5 g L -1 (95% CI, 6.8-12.2; P<0.001).

Conclusions

In patients with a low preoperative haemoglobin and iron deficiency, preoperative treatment with a single dose of ferric derisomaltose and darbepoetin decreased the proportion of participants who received a perioperative blood transfusion as a consequence of a greater increase in haemoglobin compared with treatment with oral ferrous sulphate.

Inflammatory bowel disease—iron deficiency anemia screening and treatment: all patients with IBD are at risk for anemia. For laboratory screening, a complete blood count, serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, and C-reactive protein should be used. For patients in remission or mild disease, measurements are suggested every 6–12 months, and in active disease it is suggested to repeat screening every 3 months. In the presence of iron deficiency, iron supplementation is advised; intravenous iron is considered more effective and often better tolerated than oral iron, oral iron repletion is reasonable in mild anemia or clinically inactive disease, and dosing is based on baseline hemoglobin and body weight.

### Guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of iron deficiency across indications: a systematic review [^e471c185]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of iron deficiency (ID) vary widely across indications.

Objective

We reviewed all available guidelines on the management of ID worldwide.

Design

A literature search was conducted in PubMed, Cochrane, and EMBASE and in main professional association websites, limited to documents published between 1 January 2004 and 30 June 2014.

Results

Of 127 guidelines identified, 29 were selected, involving 29 professional associations and issued from the United States (n = 8), Europe (n = 6), Britain (n = 4), Canada (n = 3), international organizations (n = 2), France (n = 2), Poland (n = 1), Australia (n = 1), Mexico (n = 1), and Japan (n = 1). A total of 22 and 27 guidelines provided recommendations on diagnosis and treatment of ID, respectively. To define ID, all guidelines recommended a concentration for serum ferritin. One-half of them (10 of 22) proposed transferrin saturation (TSAT) as an alternative or complementary diagnostic test. To treat ID, most of the guidelines (18 of 27) recommended preferentially the oral route if possible, particularly in children and in women in the pre- or postpregnancy period. Iron supplementation should be administered intravenously according to 13 of 27 guidelines, particularly in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) (n = 7) and chemotherapy-induced anemia (n = 5). Treatment targets for ID included an increase in hemoglobin concentrations to 10-12 g/dL or normalization (n = 8) and serum ferritin >100 μg/L (n = 7) or 200 μg/L (n = 4). For the latter, in some situations, such as CKD, ferritin concentrations should not exceed 500 μg/L (n = 5) or 800 μg/L (n = 5). Only 9 guidelines recommended TSAT as a target, proposing various thresholds ranging from 20% to 50%.

Conclusions

It appears that for the diagnosis of ID, a cutoff of 100 μg/L for serum ferritin concentration should be considered in most conditions and 20% for TSAT, except in particular situations, including young healthy women with heavy menstrual flow. New indications of intravenous iron supplementation are emerging.

### Dietary nonheme iron is equally bioavailable from ferritin or ferrous sulfate in thalassemia intermedia [^0508aaee]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Transfusion-independent patients with thalassemia intermedia (TI) develop fatal iron overload from excessive iron absorption triggered by ineffective erythropoiesis. More information about iron pharmacokinetics and nonheme, dietary iron absorption in such patients is needed to optimize management. To obtain more information, different forms of supplemental nonheme iron sources (ferritin and ferrous sulfate) were compared in 4 TI (hemoglobin <9 g/dL) and 6 control (hemoglobin 12-16 g/dL) patients. Serial serum iron concentrations were measured during the 24 hours following consumption of 1 mg/kg of elemental iron as ferritin or ferrous sulfate. Serum iron concentrations were also measured for one TI patient and one control patient 2 hours after the ingestion of 2 mg/kg of dietary iron in ferritin or ferrous sulfate. Maximum serum iron concentrations were observed 4 hours after the consumption of either dietary iron source. However, the serum iron values were unchanged for either dietary iron source, even at the higher doses of consumed iron. Thus, the bioavailability of dietary iron, either as ferritin or ferrous sulfate, was equivalent in both groups of patients. The pilot data support ferritin as an alternative dietary iron supplement to ferrous sulfate.

### Effect of low-dose ferrous sulfate vs iron polysaccharide complex on hemoglobin concentration in young children with nutritional iron-deficiency anemia: a randomized clinical trial [^fa92b80f]. JAMA (2017). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) affects millions of persons worldwide, and is associated with impaired neurodevelopment in infants and children. Ferrous sulfate is the most commonly prescribed oral iron despite iron polysaccharide complex possibly being better tolerated.

Objective

To compare the effect of ferrous sulfate with iron polysaccharide complex on hemoglobin concentration in infants and children with nutritional IDA.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Double-blind, superiority randomized clinical trial of infants and children aged 9 to 48 months with nutritional IDA (assessed by history and laboratory criteria) that was conducted in an outpatient hematology clinic at a US tertiary care hospital from September 2013 through November 2015; 12-week follow-up ended in January 2016.

Interventions

Three mg/kg of elemental iron once daily as either ferrous sulfate drops or iron polysaccharide complex drops for 12 weeks.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary outcome was change in hemoglobin over 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes included complete resolution of IDA (defined as hemoglobin concentration >11 g/dL, mean corpuscular volume >70 fL, reticulocyte hemoglobin equivalent >25 pg, serum ferritin level >15 ng/mL, and total iron-binding capacity <425 μg/dL at the 12-week visit), changes in serum ferritin level and total iron-binding capacity, adverse effects.

Results

Of 80 randomized infants and children (median age, 22 months; 55% male; 61% Hispanic white; 40 per group), 59 completed the trial (28 [70%] in ferrous sulfate group; 31 [78%] in iron polysaccharide complex group). From baseline to 12 weeks, mean hemoglobin increased from 7.9 to 11.9 g/dL (ferrous sulfate group) vs 7.7 to 11.1 g/dL (iron complex group), a greater difference of 1.0 g/dL (95% CI, 0.4 to 1.6 g/dL; P<.001) with ferrous sulfate (based on a linear mixed model). Proportion with a complete resolution of IDA was higher in the ferrous sulfate group (29% vs 6%; P=.04). Median serum ferritin level increased from 3.0 to 15.6 ng/mL (ferrous sulfate) vs 2.0 to 7.5 ng/mL (iron complex) over 12 weeks, a greater difference of 10.2 ng/mL (95% CI, 6.2 to 14.1 ng/mL; P<.001) with ferrous sulfate. Mean total iron-binding capacity decreased from 501 to 389 μg/dL (ferrous sulfate) vs 506 to 417 μg/dL (iron complex) (a greater difference of -50 μg/dL [95% CI, -86 to -14 μg/dL] with ferrous sulfate; P<.001). There were more reports of diarrhea in the iron complex group than in the ferrous sulfate group (58% vs 35%, respectively; P=.04).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among infants and children aged 9 to 48 months with nutritional iron-deficiency anemia, ferrous sulfate compared with iron polysaccharide complex resulted in a greater increase in hemoglobin concentration at 12 weeks. Once daily, low-dose ferrous sulfate should be considered for children with nutritional iron-deficiency anemia.

### Iron deficiency anaemia [^a97d6fd3]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

Anaemia affects roughly a third of the world's population; half the cases are due to iron deficiency. It is a major and global public health problem that affects maternal and child mortality, physical performance, and referral to health-care professionals. Children aged 0-5 years, women of childbearing age, and pregnant women are particularly at risk. Several chronic diseases are frequently associated with iron deficiency anaemia--notably chronic kidney disease, chronic heart failure, cancer, and inflammatory bowel disease. Measurement of serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, serum soluble transferrin receptors, and the serum soluble transferrin receptors-ferritin index are more accurate than classic red cell indices in the diagnosis of iron deficiency anaemia. In addition to the search for and treatment of the cause of iron deficiency, treatment strategies encompass prevention, including food fortification and iron supplementation. Oral iron is usually recommended as first-line therapy, but the most recent intravenous iron formulations, which have been available for nearly a decade, seem to replenish iron stores safely and effectively. Hepcidin has a key role in iron homoeostasis and could be a future diagnostic and therapeutic target. In this Seminar, we discuss the clinical presentation, epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and acute management of iron deficiency anaemia, and outstanding research questions for treatment.

### Safety of intravenous ferric carboxymaltose versus oral iron in patients with nondialysis-dependent CKD: an analysis of the 1-year FIND-CKD trial [^d12a8d3e]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2017). Low credibility.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

FIND-CKD was a 56-week, open-label, multicenter, prospective, randomized, three-arm study undertaken at 193 nephrology centers in 20 countries during 2009–12 (ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT00994318).

Study population

Eligibility criteria have been described in full previously. Adult patients with nondialysis-dependent CKD were eligible if (i) at least one Hb level was 9–11 g/dL; (ii) any ferritin level was <100 µg/L, or <200 µg/L with TSAT <20%; (iii) estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was ≤60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 [Modification of Diet in Renal Disease-4 (MDRD-4) equation] and eGFR loss was ≤12 mL/min/1.73 m²/year with predicted eGFR at 12 months ≥15 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ; and (iv) no ESA therapy was received within 4 months of randomization. Exclusion criteria included a documented history of discontinuing oral iron products due to significant gastrointestinal distress and active malignancy.

Study treatment

Patients were randomized in 1:1:2 ratio to high ferritin FCM, low ferritin FCM or oral iron. FCM dose (Ferinject ®, Vifor International, St Gallen, Switzerland) in the high ferritin and low ferritin FCM groups was adjusted to target a ferritin level of 400−600 and 100–200 µg/L, respectively. Oral iron therapy consisted of commercially available ferrous sulfate at a dose of 304 mg (100 mg of iron) twice daily to Week 52.

Until Week 8 post-randomization, patients were not to receive ESAs, blood transfusion or any anemia therapy other than study drug unless there was an absolute requirement.

### Intravenous ferric gluconate significantly improves response to epoetin alfa versus oral iron or no iron in anemic patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy [^c54c6028]. The Oncologist (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravenous (IV) sodium ferric gluconate complex (FG), oral ferrous sulfate, or no iron to increase hemoglobin (Hb) in anemic cancer patients receiving chemotherapy and epoetin alfa.

Patients and Methods

In this open-label, multicenter trial, 187 patients with chemotherapy-related anemia (Hb <11 g/dl; serum ferritin > or =100 ng/ml or transferrin saturation > or =15%) scheduled to receive chemotherapy and epoetin alfa (40,000 U subcutaneously weekly) were randomized to 8 weeks of 125 mg of IV FG weekly, 325 mg of oral ferrous sulfate three times daily, or no iron. The primary outcome was a change in Hb from baseline to endpoint, first whole-blood or red blood cell transfusion, or study withdrawal.

Results

One hundred twenty-nine patients were evaluable for efficacy (FG, n = 41; oral iron, n = 44; no iron, n = 44). Mean increase in Hb was 2.4 g/dl (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.1-2.7) for FG (p = .0092 vs. oral iron; p = .0044 vs. no iron), 1.6 g/dl (95% CI, 1.1-2.1) for oral iron (p =.7695 vs. no iron), and 1.5 g/dl (95% CI, 1.1-1.9) for no iron. Hb response (increase > or =2 g/dl) was 73% for FG (p = .0099 vs. oral iron; p = .0029 vs. no iron), 46% for oral iron (p = .6687 vs. no iron), and 41% for no iron. FG was well tolerated.

Conclusion

For cancer patients with chemotherapy-related anemia receiving epoetin alfa, FG produces a significantly greater increase in Hb and Hb response compared with oral iron or no iron, supporting more aggressive treatment with IV iron supplementation for these patients.

### Iron deficiency screening is a key issue in chronic inflammatory diseases: a call to action [^80f8c00a]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Comparable efficacy was shown in a multicentric noninferiority trial, which included 350 nondialysis CKD patients with anemia. The effects of parenteral supplementation (isomaltose iron 1000 mg/injection) versus oral ferrous sulfate (100 mg × 2/day × 8 weeks) were compared. Parenteral supplementation was noninferior to oral supplementation in terms of increase in hemoglobin level at week 4 (primary endpoint). Correction of the serum ferritin and TSAT was also significantly better with intravenous supplementation.

Although a recent meta‐analysis showed no impact of ID correction on mortality in CKD patients, intravenous iron compared with oral iron increased hemoglobin, serum ferritin, and TSAT and reduced ESA requirements.

High‐dose intravenous iron was suspected of increasing the risk of infections, arterial calcifications, atherothrombosis, and oxidative stress. The PIVOTAL study included 2141 dialysis patients with serum ferritin <400 µg/L and TSAT <30%. Patients were randomized to receive high‐dose intravenous iron (400 mg per month as long as serum ferritin was <700 ng/ml and TSAT <40%) or low‐dose intravenous iron (0–400 mg only if serum ferritin was <200 ng/ml or TSAT <20%). The primary endpoint was a composite of nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, hospitalization for HF, or death. The authors concluded that in dialysis patients, the use of a proactively administered high‐dose intravenous iron regimen resulted in a significantly lower risk of death or major nonfatal cardiovascular events as compared with that observed with a reactive, low‐dose regimen. A significantly lower dose of ESA and a lower incidence of blood transfusion were also observed. The incidence of infection and hospitalization for any cause was comparable in the two treatment groups.

### Ferric carboxymaltose injection in the treatment of postpartum iron deficiency anemia: a randomized controlled clinical trial [^24857a1a]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of intravenous ferric carboxymaltose, compared with oral ferrous sulfate in women with postpartum anemia.

Study Design

In a multicenter, randomized, controlled study, 291 women less than 10 days after delivery with hemoglobin 10 g/dL or less were randomized to receive ferric carboxymaltose (n = 143) 1000 mg or less intravenously over 15 minutes or less, repeated weekly to a calculated replacement dose (maximum 2500 mg) or ferrous sulfate (n = 148) 325 mg orally thrice daily for 6 weeks.

Results

Ferric carboxymaltose-treated subjects were significantly more likely to: (1) achieve a hemoglobin greater than 12 g/dL in a shorter time period with a sustained hemoglobin greater than 12 g/dL at day 42, (2) achieve hemoglobin rise 3 g/dL or greater more quickly, and (3) attain higher serum transferrin saturation and ferritin levels. Drug-related adverse events occurred less frequently with ferric carboxymaltose.

Conclusion

Intravenous ferric carboxymaltose was safe and well tolerated with an efficacy superior to oral ferrous sulfate in the treatment of postpartum iron deficiency anemia.

### Oral iron supplementation: new formulations, old questions [^daad4201]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

In two prospective, open-label RCT with non-anemic, iron-deficient, premenopausal women, the participants received ferrous sulfate containing three different iron isotopes.The first study examined the differences between intake of 60 mg elemental iron on consecutive versus alternate days, while the second study assessed the impact of split dosing of 120 mg elemental iron (in two doses of 60 mg each per day) versus single daily dosing. In line with the pilot data,split dosing twice per day, as well as single daily dosing of 120 mg iron induced hepcidin, which diminished iron absorption the next day.Using the same methodology, a cross-over study involving premenopausal women with IDA compared iron absorption from ferrous sulfate at doses of 100 mg and 200 mg elemental iron administered either on two consecutive days or on alternate days. Total iron absorption from a single dose of 200 mg given on alternate days was almost twice that from 100 mg given on consecutive days.In a RCT with IDA patients, the primary endpoint of a 2 g/ dL rise in hemoglobin at 3 and 6 weeks was reached by significantly more patients taking 60 mg elemental iron twice daily versus 120 mg on alternate days.However, the median hemoglobin rise in the “alternate day” arm at 6 weeks was not significantly different from that in the “twice daily” arm at 3 weeks, while the treatment was better tolerated in the “alternate day” group. Similar results were obtained by other studies involving IDA patients.Current evidence supports the concept that intermittent iron supplementation every other day may be as effective as daily supplementation in controlling IDA, but with fewer adverse effects, at least in women of reproductive age.Nevertheless, this view is based on a small number of studies, some of them with methodological limitations. Thus, validation in more robust and adequately powered RCT with IDA patients of various etiologies is warranted. In any case, the new findings are reflected in the British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines,which recommend an initial treatment of IDA with “ one tablet per day of ferrous sulfate, fumarate, or gluconate. If not tolerated, a reduced dose of one tablet every other day, alternative oral preparations or parenteral iron should be considered ”. It should be noted that all data favoring oral iron supplementation every other day were obtained using ferrous sulfate. Therefore, the recommendation for intermittent iron intake is restricted to ferrous salts.Whether this also applies to other iron supplements remains to be examined. There is evidence that ferric maltol induces hepcidin similarly to ferrous sulfate in IBD patients,while ferric citrate promoted a stronger increase in hepcidin compared to ferrous sulfate in non-dialysis CKD patients.On the other hand, administration of iron protein succinylateor sucrosomial ® irondid not affect hepcidin in rats and mice, respectively. Interestingly, ferric citrateor sucrosomial ® ironeffectively increased hemoglobinization in mouse models of hepcidin overexpression. These findings may be relevant to anemic patients who respond poorly to conventional oral iron supplements and require intravenous iron. This occurs in a subset of IBD or CKD patients who exhibit restricted iron availability for erythropoiesis due to inflammatory hepcidin induction (and impaired renal clearance of hepcidin in CKD), combined with IDA or not. The same considerations apply to patients with iron-refractory iron deficiency anemia (IRIDA), a genetic disorder caused by inactivation of the hepcidin suppressor TMPRSS6.

### EASL clinical practice guidelines on haemochromatosis [^eaaf9315]. Journal of Hepatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Haemochromatosis is characterised by elevated transferrin saturation (TSAT) and progressive iron loading that mainly affects the liver. Early diagnosis and treatment by phlebotomy can prevent cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, diabetes, arthropathy and other complications. In patients homozygous for p.Cys282Tyr in HFE, provisional iron overload based on serum iron parameters (TSAT >45% and ferritin >200 μg/L in females and TSAT >50% and ferritin >300 μg/L in males and postmenopausal women) is sufficient to diagnose haemochromatosis. In patients with high TSAT and elevated ferritin but other HFE genotypes, diagnosis requires the presence of hepatic iron overload on MRI or liver biopsy. The stage of liver fibrosis and other end-organ damage should be carefully assessed at diagnosis because they determine disease management. Patients with advanced fibrosis should be included in a screening programme for hepatocellular carcinoma. Treatment targets for phlebotomy are ferritin <50 μg/L during the induction phase and <100 μg/L during the maintenance phase.

To improve the rate of ferrous sulfate prescription for suspected IDA among infants aged 8-13months to 75% or greater within 24 months.

Methods

We implemented a multidisciplinary process improvement effort aimed at standardising treatment for suspected IDA at two academic paediatric primary care clinics. We developed a clinical pathway with screening and treatment recommendations, followed by multiple plan-do-study-act cycles including provider education, targeted reminders when ferrous sulfate was not prescribed and development of standardised procedures for responding to abnormal lab values. We tracked prescription and screening rates using statistical process control charts. In post hoc analyses, we examined rates of haemoglobin (Hgb) recheck and normalisation for the preintervention versus postintervention groups.

Results

The prescription rate for suspected IDA increased from 41% to 78% following implementation of the intervention. Common reasons for treatment failure included prescription of a multivitamin instead of ferrous sulfate, and Hgb not flagged as low by the electronic medical record. Screening rates remained stable at 89%. Forty-one per cent of patients with anaemia in the preintervention group had their Hgb rechecked within 6 months, compared with 56% in the postintervention group (p<0.001). Furthermore, 30% of patients with anaemia in the postintervention group had normalised their Hgb by 6 months, compared with 20% in the preintervention group (p<0.05).

Conclusions

A multipronged interdisciplinary quality improvement intervention enabled: (1) development of standardised practices for treating suspected IDA among infants aged 8-13months, (2) improvement of prescription rates and (3) maintenance of high screening rates. Rates of Hgb recheck and normalisation also increased in the intervention period.​.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of iron deficiency anemia: expert review [^2bcd92de]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Oral iron supplementation—product selection, adverse effects, and absorption strategies: Many formulations are available without substantial evidence that any one product is better than another, and ferrous salts (ferrous sulfate, ferrous fumarate, and ferrous gluconate) are a reasonable low-cost starting choice. Side effects are common, with a meta-analysis reporting constipation in 12%, diarrhea in 8%, and nausea in 11%. Serum hepcidin rises after oral dosing and remains increased for up to 48 hours; early data suggest every-other-day dosing appears to improve tolerance but needs better study before implementation. Absorption can be enhanced by taking iron with 80 mg ascorbic acid on an empty stomach, though evidence supporting vitamin C to improve absorption is mixed and needs further clarification. Tea and coffee are powerful inhibitors and should not be consumed within an hour after taking iron. Although absorption is better on an empty stomach, some patients will better tolerate iron with meals; if feasible, taking iron with meat protein will improve absorption, and using 500 mg vitamin C will allow absorption even if calcium or fiber is present in the meal.

### Iron deficiency anaemia: pathophysiology, assessment, practical management [^279cff9f]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Assessment and diagnosis

The WHO defines anaemia as blood Hb level below 130 g/L in men and 120 g/L in women.In isolated iron deficiency, serum ferritin (the storage molecule for iron) should be less than 30 ug/L.However, ferritin is an acute phase protein and can be increased in the presence of inflammation.Thus, if there is evidence of concomitant inflammation, such as elevated C reactive protein, ferritin less than 100 ug/L is indicative of IDA.Transferrin, the iron transporter, is generally elevated; however, it is a negative acute phase protein and, therefore, can be normal or reduced in chronic inflammatory states.Serum iron and transferrin saturations (TSAT) will be reduced with TSAT less than 20% required for the diagnosis of IDA.See table 1 for the breakdown of diagnostic criteria for IDA. It is crucial to note that iron deficiency should not be excluded in the presence of a normal Hb as a significant amount of iron must be lost before the Hb levels begin to decline. Thus, a low mean corpuscular Hb with a normal Hb or an increase in red cell distribution width signifies mild iron deficiency without anaemia.

Table 1 
Diagnostic criteria for iron deficiency anaemia

Management

Patients with IDA should be treated with the aim of replenishing iron stores and returning the Hb to a normal level. This has been shown to improve QoL, morbidity, prognosis in chronic disease and outcomes in pregnancy.Iron replenishment can occur via three routes: oral iron, parenteral oral and transfusion of packed red cells. Each route has its benefits and limitations, which will be discussed below in greater detail.

### Threshold ferritin and hepcidin concentrations indicating early iron deficiency in young women based on upregulation of iron absorption [^3bdd6fca]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Iron deficiency is estimated to affect two billion people and is the leading cause of anemia worldwide. The serum or plasma ferritin concentration (referred to hereafter as ferritin) is the most widely used indicator to detect iron deficiency and a low ferritin indicates depleted iron stores. However, the threshold ferritin that defines iron deficiency remains unclearand diagnostic ferritin cutoffs from expert groups vary widely. WHO proposes that iron deficiency is present in adults when ferritin is <15 µg/L 2. This threshold was derived from studies examining the highest ferritin among adults with iron-deficiency anemia who showed a therapeutic response to iron or who had absent bone marrow iron. Considering this definition, it is not unexpected that a ferritin <15 µg/L is a specific but insensitive threshold for iron deficiency, which precedes iron-deficiency anemia. To increase the sensitivity of ferritin to detect iron deficiency, other experts recommend using higher cut-offs to avoid false-negative tests that would leave iron deficiency untreated [,–]. However, there is little evidence available to justify higher ferritin thresholds. Moreover, many studies that compared ferritin to absent bone marrow iron were done in hospitalized patients and were likely biased by inflammation, that increases ferritin independent of iron stores.

A largely unexplored reference method for defining iron deficiency is based on the fact that low iron stores trigger an increase in dietary iron absorption. In otherwise healthy individuals, low hepatic iron stores attenuate the bone morphogenetic protein–SMAD (BMP-SMAD) pathway, which reduces hepatic hepcidin synthesis, and low circulating hepcidin increases dietary iron absorption. Importantly, dietary iron absorption is already increased when a reduction in liver iron stores has not yet reduced serum iron or transferrin saturation. Iron absorption measured via erythrocyte iron incorporation of isotopic tracers has long been regarded as the most sensitive indirect measure of body iron stores.

A recent WHO review emphasized the need for additional research to establish a ferritin cutoff for iron deficiency. Using standardized methods, our laboratory has performed multiple stable iron isotope studies in healthy young women with varying iron status to measure iron absorption from meals extrinsically-labeled with ferrous sulfate. Pooling these data, our study aim was to define the ferritin concentration in young women at which the body senses iron depletion and begins to upregulate iron absorption from the diet; this approach could provide a functionally-defined threshold of incipient iron deficiency. At the same time, we hypothesized that this threshold ferritin value would correspond to the hepcidin threshold at which iron absorption begins to increase.

### Iron therapy for the treatment of iron deficiency in chronic heart failure: intravenous or oral? [^3acd0e5e]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2015). Low credibility.

Characteristics of iron therapies

Oral iron

Oral iron therapy is relatively inexpensive and widely used, but the absorption of iron is low. It also means that iron uptake can be inadequate to meet enhanced demand during treatment with an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA), limiting the haematopoietic response.Oral iron is most frequently given in the form of ferrous (Fe[II]) salts, such as ferrous sulfate.

Oxidation of Fe(II) to Fe(III) can provoke oxidative damage at the mucosal boundary, resulting in local toxicity which leads to gastrointestinal side effects in up to 60% of patients.These include complications such as constipation, dyspepsia, nausea, diarrhoea, and heartburn, which are particularly frequent with ferrous sulfate preparations and often lead to poor compliance. Many constituents of food and some medications interact with ferrous salts, such that iron uptake is best when taken on an empty stomach, but gastrointestinal side effects are often improved by concomitant food, so there can be a difficult balance between maximizing uptake and minimizing gastrointestinal side effects.

Oxidative stress, with the potential for adverse consequences, has been observed in animal studies during treatment with ferrous salts, especially at high doses. Evidence suggests that this may include disruption of cell membranes, lipid peroxidation, DNA strand breakage, and immunological disturbances.Moreover, ferrous salts have been found to increase the severity of experimental colitis and affect the intestinal microbiomass due to redox reactions which lead to the production of ROS and mediate intestinal damage in rodents,with evidence of increased prevalence of intestinal adenomas.Long-term iron overload via dietary iron in rats induces necrosis in multiple organs, an effect attributed to cellular iron accumulation and consequent oxidative stress.The effects of oxidative stress can be avoided by use of the oral preparation iron[III]–polymaltose complex, which includes a polymaltose shell for stability so that iron is released in a controlled manner and non-transferrin-bound iron (NTBI) does not increase.The structure of the iron[III]–polymaltose complex also minimizes the interactions with food or concomitant medications that can affect uptake of iron from ferrous salts.Clinically, data from patients with inflammatory bowel disease have demonstrated a significant increase in lipid peroxidation following ferrous sulfate treatment for 14 days compared with iron[III]–polymaltose complex.

### Optimizing diagnosis and treatment of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia in women and girls of reproductive age: clinical opinion [^dc39f1e3]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency (ID) is the world's most common disorder and one of the top five causes of years lived with disability. Whereas low serum ferritin is diagnostic of ID, ferritin-an acute phase reactant-may be elevated in inflammatory states and the first trimester of pregnancy even if ID exists. Consequently, in early pregnancy or chronic inflammation, percent transferrin saturation (TSAT) measurement is the best indicator of iron status. Unfortunately, current guidelines do not recommend routine screening for ID in either pregnant or nonpregnant women in the absence of anemia. This circumstance should be urgently reviewed based on available data. While oral formulations have long been the standard for iron replacement therapy and are widely available and inexpensive, oral iron is frequently associated with adverse gastrointestinal effects for the majority-a major reason for poor adherence, inadequate repletion, and persisting ID symptoms and sequellae. Although safe intravenous iron administration was introduced in the mid-1950s, formulations with cores binding the elemental iron more tightly became available in the 2000s, allowing complete and safe replacement, even in a single setting. Prospectively acquired neonatology evidence reports oral iron's failure to reach the developing fetus when the mother is iron deficient. Consequently, while oral iron remains frontline in the first trimester because of insufficient safety data for intravenous iron, the author recommends that the intravenous route should be the gold standard for second-trimester ID when hemoglobin concentrations are less than 10.5g/dL and for all iron-deficient women in their third trimester.

### A prospective, multi-center, randomized comparison of iron isomaltoside 1, 000 versus iron sucrose in patients with iron deficiency anemia ; the FERWON-IDA trial [^0cfb3422]. American Journal of Hematology (2019). Medium credibility.

2 METHODS

2.1 Trial design

This was a prospective, comparative, open‐label, randomized, multi‐center trial. For each individual, duration of the trial was approximately 10 to 15 weeks. All attended at least six visits (a screening visit, a baseline visit including investigational product administration, three assessment visits at week one, two, and four, and a final visit at week eight). If no documented intolerance of oral iron was present for at least one month, within the last nine months prior to enrolment, a run‐in period with oral iron for up to one month to document intolerance or lack of response to oral iron was required. One to four additional visits during the run‐in period (one telephone visit to initiate the run‐in period, two telephone visits to assess compliance and tolerance, and one visit to assess compliance, tolerance, and response) were scheduled. Those randomized to IS attended two additional visits, if deemed necessary to achieve the cumulative dose of IS required.

The protocol and amendments were approved by the relevant Institutional Review Boards and conducted in accordance with good clinical practice and the Declaration of Helsinki of 1975, as revised in 2008. The trial was registered with(NCT02940886). Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.

2.2 Participants

The trial was conducted at 114 sites in the USA. Patients were ≥18 years with IDA of different etiologies, and had intolerance or lack of response to oral iron or screening hemoglobin (Hb) measurement sufficiently low to require rapid repletion of iron stores. Patients with Hb ≤11 g/dL, transferrin saturation (TSAT) <20%, and s ‐ferritin <100 ng/mL, were allowed to participate in the trial, after having signed the informed consent form. Inclusion and exclusion criteria are shown in Table S1.

2.3 Interventions

Randomization was 2:1 to two groups. Onewas IIM (Monofer/Monoferric, Pharmacosmos A/S, Holbaek, Denmark) administered at baseline, as a single dose of 1000 mg infused over 20 minutes. The other was iron sucrose (Venofer, American Regent, Shirley, New York, USA) administered as 200 mg IV injections according to label and repeated up to five times (a cumulative dose of 1000 mg was recommended). During the trial, other iron supplementation than the investigational drug, blood transfusion, and erythropoiesis stimulating agents were prohibited.

### Oral iron supplementation: new formulations, old questions [^bde6cc85]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

Optimal dosage and frequency of oral iron supplementation

The elemental iron content (actual amount of iron available for absorption) differs between commercial iron formulations (Table 1). Thus, the iron dosage needs to be adjusted. Oral supplementation typically starts with ferrous sulfate or other salts, each containing ~60-70 mg elemental iron.It has traditionally been recommended to take the supplement two or three times per day on an empty stomach, to reach a daily dose of ~200 mg elemental iron. Considering that only 10-20 mg of iron gets absorbed, this amount would be required to reach the target of increasing hemoglobin by 2 g/dL within 3-4 weeks.However, recent studies provided new insights on optimal dosing and frequency, challenging the need for multiple dosing per day. The studies were prompted by our understanding that iron intake triggers homeostatic responses aiming to prevent iron overload. These are orchestrated by hepcidin, which is induced in an iron-dependent manner to inhibit further iron absorption(Figure 2).

Thus, the effects of hepcidin on oral iron supplementation were first examined in an elegant pilot study with non-anemic iron-deficient young women.They were treated with various doses of ferrous sulfate in different schedules (twice per day, daily, or every second day). Ferrous sulfate was provided in three different iron isotopes, so that each participant served as her own control. The results showed that ingestion of ferrous sulfate at doses of 60 mg elemental iron or higher triggered induction of hepcidin for up to 24 h, which decreased fractional iron absorption from a subsequent dose the following day. Hepcidin levels returned to baseline after 48 h, restoring efficient iron absorption. These early data seem to disqualify the split dosing of ferrous sulfate two or three times per day, and even favor intermittent intake every second day versus daily dosing, to bypass the hepcidin blockade and increase fractional iron absorption.

### Iron deficiency: new insights into diagnosis and treatment [^48f70d93]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2015). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia are common conditions worldwide affecting especially children and young women. In developing countries, iron deficiency is caused by poor iron intake and/or parasitic infection, whereas vegetarian dietary choices, poor iron absorption, and chronic blood loss are common causes in high-income countries. Erythropoiesis stimulating agents can result in functional iron deficiency for erythropoiesis even when stores are iron-replete. Diagnosis of iron deficiency is straightforward, except when it occurs in the context of inflammatory disorders. Oral iron salts correct absolute iron deficiency in most patients, because low hepcidin levels facilitate iron absorption. Unfortunately frequent side effects limit oral iron efficacy. Intravenous iron is increasingly utilized, because currently available preparations allow rapid normalization of total body iron even with a single infusion and are effective also in functional iron deficiency and in iron deficiency associated with inflammatory disorders. The evidence is accumulating that these preparations are safe and effective. However, long-term safety issues of high doses of iron need to be further explored.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on anaemia of chronic kidney disease [^b95786dd]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Guideline 2.4 - treatment of Anaemia with iron therapy - upper limit for iron therapy

We recommend that serum ferritin should not exceed 800 microgram/L in patients treated with iron, and to achieve this iron management should be reviewed when the ferritin is >500 microgram/L. (1B)

Rationale

• Iron overload is defined as increased total body iron content with the possible risk of organ dysfunction.

• There is no clinically available method that accurately determines total body iron content.

• An elevated serum ferritin does not always correlate with elevations in liver iron content.

• Magnetic resonance imaging provides a reliable assessment of tissue iron content in HD patients regularly treated with parenteral iron. However, the clinical relevance of increased liver iron remains unclear.

• Elevated serum ferritin together with elevated serum transferrin saturation remain the most clinically accurate parameter of iron overload in CKD patients.

• Discontinuation of adequate maintenance IV iron when an individual’s ferritin is >500 microgram/L produces a population mean that straddles the 500microgram/L ceiling. Ongoing iron therapy in patients with ferritin >500 microgram/L results in a higher median ferritin outcome.

• Interpretation of iron status results and deciding on the need for further iron therapy should include a concomitant assessment of changes in Hb level and ESA dose over time. Examples:

• A dropping ferritin as well as decreasing Hb levels signifies blood loss e.g. on HD or bowel related anaemia: iron therapy is indicated; further investigation may be required depending on the clinical scenario.

• A decreasing ferritin level after initiation of ESA therapy, with a concomitant rise in Hb level indicates a response to ESA with a shift of iron from stores to bone marrow: further iron therapy is guided by target ferritin level.

• An increasing ferritin level after reduction of ESA dose to bring Hb level down to target range indicates ferritin level is rising as Hb synthesis is dropping: further iron therapy may be postponed.

### Iron therapy for the treatment of iron deficiency in chronic heart failure: intravenous or oral? [^503fae8f]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2015). Low credibility.

Figure 2 
Effect of oral or i.v. iron therapy on ‘hepcidin block’ of iron release from macrophages. (A) Under normal circumstances, ∼25 mg of stored iron per day is transported out of macrophages to plasma transferrin by the iron transporter protein ferroportin. (B) In chronic disease, elevated levels of hepcidin cause degradation of ferroportin, restricting ferroportin-mediated transport to ∼15 mg iron/day, (C) The rate of iron absorption from iron therapy is inadequate to influence this ‘hepcidin block’. (D) I.v. iron therapy results in high intracellular iron levels which overcome the ‘hepcidin block’ by stimulating overexpression of ferroportin (modified from Aapro et al.).

Iron therapy dosing

The median required dose of iron to achieve iron repletion in iron-deficient patients with heart failure is 1000 mg.In patients with iron deficiency anaemia, the rate of iron bioavailability from a therapeutic dose of oral 100 mg ferrous sulfate, the most commonly used oral iron preparation, and iron[III]–polymaltose complex, is ∼10%.Given that a typical dose of ferrous sulfate is 100–200 mg iron/day, in the ‘best case’ scenario, a patient who tolerates treatment of 200 mg/day might absorb only 20 mg of iron and thus require 50 days to correct the iron deficit. In a ‘worst case’ scenario, given that patients with chronic heart failure may have as little as half the usual rate of active carrier-mediated intestinal absorption capacity,a patient who can tolerate up to 100 mg iron/day might absorb only 5% (5 mg). It would thus require 200 days to replenish iron stores. In practice, correction of iron deficiency for heart failure patients will often take longer due to non-adherence or interruption due to gastrointestinal side effects, or missed doses due to the high pill burden. Therefore, replenishment of iron stores with oral iron can be expected to require >6 months. In contrast, one or two doses of i.v. iron therapy can achieve rapid repletion (Table 3). I.v. administration, however, places additional demands on the treatment centre (Table 3).

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

Two clinical studies (Studies A and B) were conducted in adults and one clinical study was conducted in pediatric patients (Study C) to assess the efficacy and safety of Ferrlecit.

Study A

Study A was a three-center, randomized, open-label study of the safety and efficacy of two doses of Ferrlecit administered intravenously to iron-deficient hemodialysis patients. The study included both a dose-response concurrent control and an historical control. Enrolled patients received a test dose of Ferrlecit (25 mg of elemental iron) and were then randomly assigned to receive Ferrlecit at cumulative doses of either 500 mg (low dose) or 1000 mg (high dose) of elemental iron. Ferrlecit was given to both dose groups in eight divided doses during sequential dialysis sessions (a period of 16 to 17 days). At each dialysis session, patients in the low-dose group received Ferrlecit 62.5 mg of elemental iron over 30 minutes, and those in the high-dose group received Ferrlecit 125 mg of elemental iron over 60 minutes. The primary endpoint was the change in hemoglobin from baseline to the last available observation through Day 40.

Eligibility for this study included chronic hemodialysis patients with a hemoglobin below 10 g/dL (or hematocrit at or below 32%) and either serum ferritin below 100 ng/mL or transferrin saturation below 18%. Exclusion criteria included significant underlying disease or inflammatory conditions or an epoetin requirement of greater than 10,000 units three times per week. Parenteral iron and red cell transfusion were not allowed for two months before the study. Oral iron and red cell transfusion were not allowed during the study for Ferrlecit-treated patients.

The commentary highlights data that intravenous iron given to patients with ferritin >500 ng/mL reduced ESA doses and costs, and states a therapeutic trial of IV iron (or oral iron in CKD ND) “should be considered when TSAT is low (≤30%), even if ferritin concentration is above 500 ng/mL.” It also states “there are currently no data available that suggest long-term IV iron administration in moderate doses causes worse outcomes,” and that “Hb response to iron therapy, TSAT, and ferritin should be monitored closely and further iron therapy titrated accordingly.”

### A randomized controlled trial comparing intravenous ferric carboxymaltose with oral iron for treatment of iron deficiency anaemia of non-dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease patients [^9e1f3420]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Iron deficiency is frequently encountered in anaemic non-dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease (ND-CKD) patients. Indeed, the prevalence of low iron indices such as transferrin saturation (TSAT) levels < 20% and ferritin levels < 100 ng/mL is 20–70%, depending on CKD stage. Moreover, iron deficiency is the most common cause of hyporesponsiveness to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA). On the other hand, iron supplementation improves iron indices and haemoglobin (Hb) concentration, and reduces the required ESA dose. Thus, correction of anaemia in CKD patients requires careful balance of the ESA and iron.

The current National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative guidelines recommend either oral or intravenous (IV) iron in iron-deficient, anaemic ND-CKD patients. Unfortunately, administration of oral iron is limited by poor gastrointestinal absorption and high rate of adverse events. Over 30% of patients may experience adverse events that result in dose reduction and/or non-adherence to treatment. Alternatively, available IV iron formulations are limited by the maximum dose that can be given in a single visit, although higher non-FDA approved doses have been given. The administration of the typical 1000-mg course would require at least 10 doses of iron dextran, 8 doses of ferric gluconate, 5 doses of iron sucrose or 2 doses of ferumoxytol, which can be both inconvenient and costly for patients and healthcare providers. Thus, there is a need for an IV iron agent that can be safely administered in large single doses, which require less frequent clinic visits and fewer venipunctures.

### Critical re-evaluation of the identification of iron deficiency States and effective iron repletion strategies in patients with chronic heart failure [^14248845]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

According to current guidelines, iron deficiency is defined by a serum ferritin level <100ng/ml or a transferrin saturation (TSAT) <20% if the serum ferritin level is 100-299μg/L. These criteria were developed to encourage the use of intravenous iron as an adjunct to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents in the treatment of renal anaemia. However, in patients with heart failure, these criteria are not supported by any pathophysiological or clinical evidence that they identify an absolute or functional iron deficiency state. A low baseline TSAT-but not serum ferritin level-appears to be a reliable indicator of the effect of intravenous iron to reduce major heart failure events. In randomized controlled trials, intravenous iron decreased the risk of cardiovascular death or total heart failure hospitalization in patients with a TSAT <20% (risk ratio 0.67 [0.49-0.92]) but not in patients with a TSAT ≥20% (risk ratio 0.99 [0.74-1.30]), with the magnitude of the risk reduction being proportional to the severity of hypoferraemia. Patients who were enrolled in clinical trials solely because they had a serum ferritin level <100μg/L showed no significant benefit on heart failure outcomes, and it is noteworthy that serum ferritin levels of 20-300μg/L lie entirely within the range of normal values for healthy adults. Current guidelines reflect the eligibility criteria of clinical trials, which inadvertently adopted unvalidated criteria to define iron deficiency. Reliance on these guidelines would lead to the treatment of many patients who are not iron deficient (serum ferritin level<100μg/L but normal TSAT) and ignores the possibility of iron deficiency in patients with a low TSAT but with serum ferritin level of >300μg/L. Importantly, analyses of benefit based on trial eligibility-driven guidelines substantially underestimate the magnitude of heart-failure-event risk reduction with intravenous iron in patients who are truly iron deficient. Based on all available data, we recommend a new mechanism-based and trial-tested approach that reflects the totality of evidence more faithfully than the historical process adopted by clinical investigators and by the guidelines. Until additional evidence is forthcoming, an iron deficiency state in patients with heart failure should be defined by a TSAT <20% (as long as the serum ferritin level is <400μg/L), and furthermore, the use of a serum ferritin level <100μg/L alone as a diagnostic criterion should be discarded.

### Supplementation with oral vs. intravenous iron for anemia with IBD or gastrointestinal bleeding: is oral iron getting a bad rap? [^5ad8b041]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Although iron supplementation is commonly prescribed, the amount of elemental iron needed to achieve clinical efficacy, and the optimal method of supplementation, are under debate. Use of intravenous (IV) iron replacement is increasingly being advocated. We explore the physiology of iron supplementation, review clinical data suggesting that the typical oral dosing of iron may be excessive, and compare IV and oral methods of iron supplementation with a focus on inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Both IV and oral iron can effectively raise hemoglobin levels in iron-deficiency anemia. There is no evidence that IV iron can raise hemoglobin at a faster pace. Side effects of oral iron are probably related to the relatively high doses of elemental iron that are typically prescribed. Emerging data suggest that low-dose iron has comparable efficacy, with fewer side effects. In IBD, both oral and IV iron are effective, and there is no convincing evidence that oral iron activates or exacerbates clinical symptoms. The use of a low starting dose of oral iron, such as one ferrous sulfate tablet per day, for treatment of iron deficiency is worth considering.

### How I treat iron-refractory iron deficiency anaemia-an expert opinion-based treatment guidance for children and adults [^8271d660]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Medium credibility.

FIGURE 3 
Flowchart of expert opinion‐based treatment guidance for IRIDA patients. This figure outlines treatment strategies for IRIDA in children and adults, based on expert opinion. Children : For mild to moderate anaemia without previous oral iron therapy, start once‐daily oral elemental iron (3 mg/kg/day, compared to the 1 mg/kg/day usually used for iron deficiency anaemia), titrating up to a maximum of 10 mg/kg/day based on evidence from case series suggesting better responses with higher doses. Minimize concurrent intake with specific foods (e.g. dairy products and fibres) and medications (e.g. calcium supplements, antacids, proton pump inhibitors) to prevent insoluble complexes that reduce iron availability.Continue oral therapy for at least 3 months before considering IV iron therapy, as prolonged oral therapy may still be effective (Table S1). In iron deficiency anaemia, a 2‐g/dL Hb increase is expected within 4 weeks.If oral iron therapy proves ineffective (including previous attempts) or severe anaemia is present, initiate IV iron therapy at 15–20 mg/kg per dose, up to a maximum of 500 mg per dose. Monitoring recommendations are consistent with adult guidelines. Adults : In adults, IRIDA often presents with a mild(er) phenotype, causing diagnostic delays with subsequent prolonged oral iron therapy before the final diagnosis of IRIDA is established. Therefore, IV iron therapy is recommended as first‐line treatment. Avoid targeting Hb normalization to prevent excessively high ferritin levels. Regularly monitor phosphate levels (at least after two administrations) during FCM therapy due to the risk of hypophosphataemia. Assessing the total iron deficit is not applicable for IRIDA patients, as it is an iron distribution disorder. *Reference intervals and definitions are age‐dependent; severe anaemia is defined according to the WHO guidelines. **Dosages are not applicable for neonates. ***Despite a recent trial found no benefit from adding ascorbic acid to oral iron therapy for iron deficiency anaemia, it may still be considered to improve iron absorption in IRIDA.****Alternate‐day dosing can reduce hepcidin‐mediated inhibition of iron uptake, which reduces iron absorption for approximately 24 h after iron intake.FCM, ferric carboxymaltose; Hb, haemoglobin; IV, intravenous; QoL, quality of life; TSAT, transferrin saturation.

### Ferric derisomaltose (Monoferric) [^65d4cc50]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

The safety and efficacy of Monoferric for treatment of iron deficiency anemia (IDA) were evaluated in two randomized, open-label, actively-controlled clinical trials performed in a total of 3050 patients with IDA of different etiology. Trial 1 included patients with IDA who had intolerance to oral iron or who had had unsatisfactory response to oral iron or for whom there was a clinical need for rapid repletion of iron stores. Trial 2 included patients with IDA who had non-dialysis dependent chronic kidney disease (NDD-CKD). In these two 8-Week trials, patients were randomized 2:1 to treatment with Monoferric or iron sucrose. Monoferric was intravenously administered as a single dose of 1000 mg.

Iron Deficiency Anemia in Patients Who Had Intolerance to Oral Iron or Who Had Unsatisfactory Response to Oral Iron

In Trial 1 (NCT02940886) 1512 adult patients with IDA caused by different etiologies, who had documented intolerance or lack of response to oral iron or screening hemoglobin (Hb) measurement sufficiently low to require repletion of iron stores were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to treatment with Monoferric or iron sucrose. Adult patients aged ≥18 years with baseline Hb ≤11 g/dL, TSAT <20 %, and s-ferritin <100 ng/mL were eligible for enrollment. The median age of patients was 44 years (range 18-91) and 89 % were women.

The efficacy of Monoferric was established based upon the change in Hb from baseline to week 8. Non-inferiority was demonstrated for change in Hb from baseline to Week 8 (Table 2).
