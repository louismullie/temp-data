## Question

Dovato

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about Dovato (dolutegravir/lamivudine). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the drug identity and formulation. Then, I should verify the mechanism of action and pharmacology. Next, I will review indications and guideline positioning. After that, I need to examine efficacy data from pivotal trials and real-world settings. I will then assess safety, tolerability, and resistance. I should confirm dosing, administration, and special populations, including renal and hepatic impairment. I must check drug interactions and contraindications. Finally, I will synthesize practical prescribing considerations and monitoring, and close with a balanced conclusion and caveats.

> Let me first confirm the drug identity and formulation. Dovato is a fixed-dose combination tablet containing dolutegravir 50 mg, an integrase strand transfer inhibitor, and lamivudine 300 mg, a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, designed as a once-daily, complete regimen for HIV-1 treatment [^db4414b4] [^109261d3].

> I need to verify the mechanism of action to ensure the pharmacologic rationale is sound. Dolutegravir binds the integrase active site and blocks strand transfer, which is essential for retroviral DNA integration, while lamivudine is phosphorylated intracellularly to 3TC-triphosphate, inhibiting reverse transcriptase via DNA chain termination; together they target two distinct steps in the HIV replication cycle, which underpins the feasibility of a two-drug regimen with a high barrier to resistance [^72db6c0a].

> Next, I should review labeled indications and guideline positioning. Dovato is indicated as a complete regimen for treatment-naive adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older and weighing at least 25 kg, and for virologically suppressed adults with no history of treatment failure and no known resistance to dolutegravir or lamivudine; major guidelines list DTG/3TC as a recommended initial regimen for most people with HIV, with exceptions for high viral load, HBV coinfection, or pending resistance results, and also endorse it as a switch strategy in suppressed patients [^2353cbd9] [^d7626fcc] [^9d718aa1] [^72f5d2f5].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about efficacy; I should double-check the pivotal trials. In GEMINI-1 and GEMINI-2, DTG/3TC was noninferior to DTG plus TDF/FTC at 48 weeks, with 91% versus 93% achieving HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies/mL, and this noninferiority persisted through 144 weeks with 82% versus 84% suppression and no treatment-emergent INSTI or NRTI resistance in those meeting virologic withdrawal criteria, supporting durable efficacy and a high barrier to resistance [^e0ca4c9a] [^260e075a] [^cb1ea062].

> I will now examine switch data to ensure maintenance of suppression. In TANGO, switching from a TAF-based regimen to DTG/3TC was noninferior at 48 weeks and remained noninferior through 144 weeks, with 0.3% versus 1.3% having HIV-1 RNA at least 50 copies/mL and no emergent resistance, confirming the regimen's utility for simplification in suppressed patients [^703fe9c0] [^0e2654a0] [^2762323c].

> But wait, what about real-world and special populations; I should review those. Observational and pilot data show high early suppression with DTG/3TC in test-and-treat settings, including patients with high viral loads, and the DOLCE study specifically demonstrated 82.2% suppression at 48 weeks in those with baseline CD4 counts 200 cells/mm3 or less, with no resistance detected, reinforcing feasibility across diverse clinical contexts when appropriately selected [^e7f1204e] [^685e6d15].

> Next, I should review safety and tolerability. Common adverse effects include headache, insomnia, nausea, diarrhea, and fatigue, with psychiatric symptoms and weight gain also reported; importantly, DTG/3TC had fewer drug-related adverse events than DTG plus TDF/FTC in GEMINI, and discontinuations due to adverse events were uncommon, though transient increases in creatinine from dolutegravir's inhibition of tubular secretion occur without affecting glomerular filtration and are not clinically meaningful [^11e563f6] [^e0ca4c9a] [^c563e2f1].

> I need to ensure I address resistance and virologic failure. Across GEMINI and TANGO, confirmed virologic withdrawals were rare and no treatment-emergent INSTI or NRTI resistance was observed in those meeting failure criteria, reflecting dolutegravir's high barrier; rare M184V emergence has been reported in nonadherent cases, underscoring the importance of adherence and baseline resistance screening [^089341c1] [^260e075a].

> Let me consider special populations and dosing adjustments. For adolescents aged 12 years and older and weighing at least 25 kg, the adult dose applies based on comparable exposure and safety in DANCE; in renal impairment, Dovato is not recommended when creatinine clearance is less than 30 mL/min because lamivudine cannot be dose-adjusted in the fixed-dose tablet, and patients with CrCl 30–49 mL/min should be monitored for hematologic toxicity; no dose adjustment is needed for mild to moderate hepatic impairment, but severe hepatic impairment is not recommended [^bc130ea3] [^3ae78409] [^25881827].

> I should confirm drug interactions and contraindications. Dovato is contraindicated with dofetilide due to increased plasma concentrations and risk of serious arrhythmias, and coadministration with carbamazepine or rifampin requires an additional 50 mg dolutegravir dose 12 hours apart because enzyme induction lowers DTG exposure; dolutegravir inhibits OCT2/MATE1, so coadministration with metformin may increase metformin levels and warrants careful monitoring [^8e899883] [^25881827] [^5e7f624b].

> Hold on, I should verify HBV considerations because this is a frequent pitfall. Lamivudine is active against HBV but monotherapy risks resistance and flares on discontinuation; therefore, all patients must be screened for HBV before starting Dovato, and those with HBV coinfection require additional HBV-active therapy such as TAF or TDF, with close monitoring if Dovato is stopped to prevent severe HBV exacerbations [^148681c1] [^5fda8dba] [^d7626fcc].

> Next, I should review practical prescribing steps. Before initiation, obtain HBV serology, assess renal function, review concomitant medications for interactions, and avoid use if CrCl is less than 30 mL/min; counsel on adherence, potential neuropsychiatric effects, and weight changes; monitor HIV RNA at 4–8 weeks, then every 3–6 months, and check creatinine and CBC periodically, especially in those with CrCl 30–49 mL/min or on interacting drugs [^25881827] [^d7626fcc].

> Let me reconsider the overall balance of benefits and limitations. Dovato offers noninferior efficacy to three-drug regimens, a high barrier to resistance with no emergent resistance in trials, fewer drug-related adverse events, smaller pill burden, and no food restrictions, but it is not appropriate for patients with HBV coinfection, CrCl less than 30 mL/min, high viral load above 500,000 copies/mL, or known resistance to DTG or 3TC, and it requires vigilance for neuropsychiatric effects and weight gain in susceptible individuals [^e0ca4c9a] [^260e075a] [^d7626fcc].

> In summary, I should confirm that Dovato is a guideline-endorsed, evidence-based two-drug regimen for appropriately selected treatment-naive and virologically suppressed adults and adolescents, with durable efficacy, favorable tolerability, and a high barrier to resistance, provided that HBV status is assessed, renal function is adequate, and there is no resistance to the components; careful patient selection and routine monitoring are essential to realize the benefits of simplified therapy while mitigating risks [^d7626fcc] [^9d718aa1] [^e0ca4c9a] [^260e075a].

Dovato (dolutegravir/lamivudine) is a **once-daily, two-drug regimen** for HIV-1 in adults and adolescents ≥ 12 years and ≥ 25 kg who are treatment-naive or virologically suppressed with no resistance to its components [^2353cbd9] [^72f5d2f5]. It is **noninferior to three-drug regimens** in GEMINI and TANGO, with durable suppression through 144 weeks and no emergent resistance in trials [^e0ca4c9a] [^0e2654a0] [^260e075a]. Key safety issues include insomnia, headache, and weight gain; rare hypersensitivity and hepatotoxicity can occur [^11e563f6] [^c563e2f1]. It is **not recommended for HBV coinfection** or CrCl < 30 mL/min, and dose adjustment is needed with rifampin or carbamazepine [^148681c1] [^25881827] [^3ae78409]. Dovato is guideline-recommended as a first-line or switch option for eligible patients [^d7626fcc] [^9d718aa1].

---

## Clinical indications and patient selection

Dovato is indicated for **two distinct populations**:

- **Treatment-naive patients**: Adults and adolescents ≥ 12 years and ≥ 25 kg with no antiretroviral treatment history [^2353cbd9] [^72f5d2f5].
- **Virologically suppressed patients**: Adults and adolescents ≥ 12 years and ≥ 25 kg who are virologically suppressed (HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL) on a stable regimen with no history of treatment failure and no known resistance to dolutegravir or lamivudine [^2353cbd9] [^9d718aa1].

---

## Clinical efficacy

Dovato's efficacy is supported by robust **phase 3 trials**:

| **Study** | **Population** | **Primary endpoint** | **Results** |
|-|-|-|-|
| GEMINI-1 and GEMINI-2 | Treatment-naive adults | Proportion with HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at Week 48 | Noninferior to dolutegravir + tenofovir/emtricitabine (91% vs 93%) [^e0ca4c9a] |
| TANGO | Virologically suppressed adults switching regimens | Proportion with HIV-1 RNA ≥ 50 copies/mL at Week 48 | Noninferior to continuing TAF-based regimens (0.3% vs 0.5%) [^703fe9c0] |
| SALSA | Virologically suppressed adults switching regimens | Proportion with HIV-1 RNA ≥ 50 copies/mL at Week 48 | Noninferior to continuing current regimens (0.6% vs 0.3%) [^89778237] |

---

Long-term data show **durability through 144 weeks** without emergent resistance in trials [^260e075a] [^0e2654a0].

---

## Safety and tolerability

Dovato is **generally well tolerated**, with a safety profile comparable to three-drug regimens. Common adverse effects include:

- **Insomnia**: 2–3% [^c563e2f1].
- **Headache**: 2–3% [^notfound].
- **Weight gain**: Median increase ~2 kg over 96 weeks; monitor for metabolic changes [^notfound].
- **Psychiatric effects**: Rare insomnia, anxiety, depression; monitor patients with psychiatric history [^b290ac80].

Serious adverse effects are uncommon and include **hypersensitivity reactions** (< 1%) and **hepatotoxicity** (rare); monitor liver function in patients with hepatic disease [^148681c1] [^118ed69b].

---

## Resistance and virologic failure

Dovato has a **high barrier to resistance**; no treatment-emergent resistance was observed in GEMINI or TANGO through 144 weeks [^260e075a] [^0e2654a0]. Virologic failure is rare and typically associated with nonadherence or pre-existing resistance [^notfound].

---

## Special populations and considerations

- **Pregnancy**: Dolutegravir is preferred; Dovato is acceptable if HBV-negative and no resistance [^d6e628de].
- **Renal impairment**: Not recommended if CrCl < 30 mL/min; use individual components if dose adjustment is needed [^25881827] [^3ae78409].
- **Hepatic impairment**: No adjustment for mild/moderate impairment; avoid in severe impairment (Child-Pugh C) [^3ae78409].
- **HBV coinfection**: Contraindicated due to risk of lamivudine resistance and HBV flare; use alternative regimens [^148681c1] [^5fda8dba].

---

## Drug interactions

Dovato has **minimal clinically significant interactions**, but key considerations include:

- **Rifampin/carbamazepine**: Increase dolutegravir clearance; add a 50 mg dolutegravir dose 12 hours after Dovato [^25881827].
- **Metformin**: Dolutegravir inhibits renal transporters; monitor for metformin toxicity [^5e7f624b].
- **Dofetilide**: Contraindicated due to risk of arrhythmia [^8e899883].

---

## Comparison with other antiretroviral regimens

Dovato offers several advantages over traditional three-drug regimens, including **fewer drugs**, which may reduce toxicity and interactions; **smaller pill burden**, supporting adherence; and a **favorable safety profile**, with fewer renal and bone adverse effects than tenofovir-containing regimens [^e0ca4c9a] [^260e075a]. Limitations include **no HBV activity** and the need to avoid use when CrCl is < 30 mL/min [^148681c1] [^25881827].

---

## Current clinical guidelines

Current guidelines recommend Dovato as a **first-line regimen** for most treatment-naive patients, with exceptions for HBV coinfection, high viral load (> 500,000 copies/mL), or pending resistance results [^d7626fcc] [^85ae79e0]. It is also endorsed as a **switch option** for virologically suppressed patients on stable regimens [^9d718aa1].

---

## Patient counseling and adherence support

Counsel patients on **adherence**, potential side effects, and the importance of regular monitoring. Provide adherence tools and address barriers to sustain virologic suppression [^118ed69b].

---

Dovato is a **simplified, effective, and safe** two-drug regimen for appropriately selected patients, offering durable suppression with minimal resistance risk. It is a valuable option for treatment-naive and virologically suppressed patients, with careful attention to HBV status, renal function, and drug interactions.

1	INDICATIONS AND USAGE

DOVATO is indicated as a complete regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older and weighing at least 25 kg with no antiretroviral treatment history or to replace the current antiretroviral regimen in those who are virologically suppressed (HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies/mL) on a stable antiretroviral regimen with no history of treatment failure and no known substitutions associated with resistance to the individual components of DOVATO.

DOVATO, a two-drug combination of dolutegravir (integrase strand transfer inhibitor [INSTI]) and lamivudine (nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitor [NRTI]) is indicated as a complete regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older and weighing at least 25 kg with no antiretroviral treatment history or to replace the current antiretroviral regimen in those who are virologically suppressed (HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies/mL) on a stable antiretroviral regimen with no history of treatment failure and no known substitutions associated with resistance to the individual components of DOVATO.

12.1	Mechanism of Action

DOVATO is a fixed-dose combination of the HIV‑1 antiretroviral agents, dolutegravir and lamivudine [see Microbiology (12.4)].

12.2	Pharmacodynamics

Cardiac Electrophysiology

The effect of combination therapy as DOVATO or lamivudine given alone on the QT interval has not been studied. At a 250-mg suspension dose (exposures approximately 3-fold that of the 50-mg once-daily dose at steady state), dolutegravir given alone did not prolong the QTc interval to any clinically relevant extent.

Effects of Dolutegravir on Renal Function

No clinically significant dolutegravir exposure-response relationship on the glomerular filtration rate or effective renal plasma flow was observed. The effect of dolutegravir on renal function was evaluated in an open-label, randomized, 3-arm, parallel, placebo-controlled trial in healthy subjects (n = 37) who received dolutegravir 50 mg once daily (n = 12), dolutegravir 50 mg twice daily (n = 13), or placebo once daily (n = 12) for 14 days.

12.4	Microbiology

Mechanism of Action

Dolutegravir: Dolutegravir inhibits HIV integrase by binding to the integrase active site and blocking the strand transfer step of retroviral DNA integration which is essential for the HIV replication cycle. Strand transfer biochemical assays using purified recombinant HIV‑1 integrase and pre-processed substrate DNA resulted in IC50values of 2.7 nM and 12.6 nM.

Lamivudine: Lamivudine is a synthetic nucleoside analogue. Intracellularly lamivudine is phosphorylated to its active 5′-triphosphate metabolite, lamivudine triphosphate (3TC‑TP). The principal mode of action of 3TC‑TP is inhibition of reverse transcriptase (RT) via DNA chain termination after incorporation of the nucleotide analogue.

Antiviral Activity in Cell Culture

Dolutegravir: Dolutegravir exhibited antiviral activity against laboratory strains of wild-type HIV‑1 with mean concentrations of drug necessary to affect viral replication by 50 percent (EC50) values of 0.5 nM (0.21 ng/mL) to 2.1 nM (0.85 ng/mL) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and MT-4 cells.

Dolutegravir exhibited antiviral activity against 13 clinically diverse clade B isolates with a mean EC50value of 0.52 nM in a viral integrase susceptibility assay using the integrase coding region from clinical isolates. Dolutegravir demonstrated antiviral activity in cell culture against a panel of HIV-1 clinical isolates (3 in each group of M [clades A-G], and 3 in group O) with EC50values ranging from 0.02 nM to 2.14 nM for HIV-1. Dolutegravir EC50values against three HIV-2 clinical isolates in PBMC assays ranged from 0.09 nM to 0.61 nM.

8.6	Renal Impairment

DOVATO is not recommended for patients with creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min because DOVATO is a fixed-dose combination and the dosage of the individual components cannot be adjusted. If a dose reduction of lamivudine, a component of DOVATO, is required for patients with creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min, then the individual components should be used.

Patients with a creatinine clearance between 30 and 49 mL/min receiving DOVATO may experience a 1.6- to 3.3-fold higher lamivudine exposure (AUC) than patients with a creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min. There are no safety data from randomized, controlled trials comparing DOVATO to the individual components in patients with a creatinine clearance between 30 and 49 mL/min who received dose-adjusted lamivudine. In the original lamivudine registrational trials in combination with zidovudine, higher lamivudine exposures were associated with higher rates of hematologic toxicities (neutropenia and anemia), although discontinuations due to neutropenia or anemia each occurred in < 1% of subjects. Patients with a sustained creatinine clearance between 30 and 49 mL/min who receive DOVATO should be monitored for hematologic toxicities. If new or worsening neutropenia or anemia develop, dose adjustment of lamivudine, per lamivudine prescribing information, is recommended. If lamivudine dose adjustment is indicated, DOVATO should be discontinued and the individual components should be used to construct the treatment regimen.

8.7	Hepatic Impairment

No dosage adjustment of DOVATO is necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Score A or B). Dolutegravir has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Score C); therefore, DOVATO is not recommended for patients with severe hepatic impairment.

5.1	Patients Co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV: Emergence of Lamivudine-Resistant HBV and the Risk of Posttreatment Exacerbations of HBV

All patients with HIV-1 should be tested for the presence of HBV prior to or when initiating DOVATO.

Emergence of Lamivudine-Resistant HBV

Safety and efficacy of lamivudine have not been established for treatment of chronic HBV in subjects dually infected with HIV-1 and HBV. Emergence of HBV variants associated with resistance to lamivudine has been reported in HIV‑1–infected subjects who have received lamivudine‑containing antiretroviral regimens in the presence of concurrent infection with HBV. If a decision is made to administer DOVATO to patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV, additional treatment should be considered for appropriate treatment of chronic HBV; otherwise, consider an alternative regimen.

Severe Acute Exacerbations of HBV in Patients Co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV

Severe acute exacerbations of HBV have been reported in patients who are co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV and have discontinued products containing lamivudine, and may occur with discontinuation of DOVATO. Patients who are co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV who discontinue DOVATO should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment with DOVATO. If appropriate, initiation of anti-HBV therapy may be warranted, especially in patients with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis, since posttreatment exacerbation of hepatitis may lead to hepatic decompensation and liver failure.

5.2	Hypersensitivity Reactions

Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with the use of dolutegravir, a component of DOVATO, and were characterized by rash, constitutional findings, and sometimes organ dysfunction, including liver injury. These events were reported in < 1% of subjects receiving dolutegravir in Phase 3 clinical trials.

Discontinue DOVATO immediately if signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions develop (including, but not limited to, severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters or peeling of the skin, oral blisters or lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, hepatitis, eosinophilia, angioedema, difficulty breathing). Clinical status, including liver aminotransferases, should be monitored and appropriate therapy initiated. Delay in stopping treatment with DOVATO or other suspect agents after the onset of hypersensitivity may result in a life-threatening reaction [see Contraindications (4)].

14.3	Clinical Trial Results in HIV-1–Infected Virologically Suppressed Adult Subjects Who Switched to DOVATO

The efficacy of DOVATO in HIV-1–infected, antiretroviral treatment-experienced, virologically suppressed subjects is supported by data from a 200-week, Phase 3, randomized, open-label, multicenter, parallel-group, non-inferiority controlled trial (TANGO). A total of 741 adult HIV-1–infected subjects who were on a stable suppressive TBR received treatment in the trial. Subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive DOVATO once daily or continue with their TBR for up to 148 weeks; at Week 148, the subjects randomized to continue with their TBR were switched to DOVATO once daily. All subjects are followed up to Week 200. Randomization was stratified by baseline third-agent class (protease inhibitor [PI], INSTI, or non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor [NNRTI]). The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of subjects with plasma HIV-1 RNA ≥ 50 copies/mL (virologic non-response) at Week 48 (Snapshot algorithm adjusting for randomization stratification factor).

At baseline, the median age of subjects was 39 years, 8% were female, 21% non-white, 5% were CDC Class C (AIDS), and 98% of subjects had baseline CD4+cell count ≥ 200 cells/mm3; these characteristics were similar between treatment arms. Subjects receiving DOVATO and a TBR had been on an antiretroviral regimen for a median of 2.8 and 2.9 years, respectively, prior to Day 1. Most subjects were on an integrase inhibitor-based TBR (78% and 80% of subjects who received DOVATO and a TBR, respectively).

2	DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Prior to or when initiating DOVATO, test patients for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. (2.1)
One tablet taken orally once daily with or without food. (2.2)
The dolutegravir dose (50 mg) in DOVATO is insufficient when coadministered with carbamazepine or rifampin. If DOVATO is coadministered with carbamazepine or rifampin, take one tablet of DOVATO once daily, followed by an additional dolutegravir 50-mg tablet, approximately 12 hours from the dose of DOVATO. (2.3)

2.1	Testing Prior to or When Initiating Treatment with DOVATO

Prior to or when initiating DOVATO, test patients for HBV infection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

2.2	Recommended Dosage

DOVATO is a fixed-dose combination product containing 50 mg of dolutegravir and 300 mg of lamivudine. The recommended dosage regimen of DOVATO in adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older and weighing at least 25 kg is one tablet taken orally once daily with or without food [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

2.3	Recommended Dosage with Certain Coadministered Drugs

The dolutegravir dose (50 mg) in DOVATO is insufficient when coadministered with drugs listed in Table 1 that may decrease dolutegravir concentrations; the following dolutegravir dosage regimen is recommended.

2.4	Not Recommended in Patients with Renal Impairment

Because DOVATO is a fixed-dose tablet and cannot be dose adjusted, DOVATO is not recommended in patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

2.5	Not Recommended in Patients with Severe Hepatic Impairment

DOVATO is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Score C) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].

14.1	Description of Clinical Trials

The efficacy and safety of DOVATO were evaluated in the studies summarized in Table 12.

14.2	Clinical Trial Results in HIV-1–Infected Adult Subjects with No Antiretroviral Treatment History

GEMINI-1 and GEMINI-2 are identical 148-week, Phase 3, randomized, multicenter, parallel-group, non-inferiority trials. A total of 1,433 HIV-1–infected adults with no antiretroviral treatment history received treatment in the trials. Subjects were enrolled with a screening plasma HIV-1 RNA of 1,000 to ≤ 500,000 copies/mL and without evidence of major resistance-associated mutations or evidence of HBV infection. Subjects were randomized to receive a 2-drug regimen of TIVICAY 50 mg plus EPIVIR 300 mg administered once daily or TIVICAY 50 mg plus fixed-dose TRUVADA administered once daily. The primary efficacy endpoint for each GEMINI trial was the proportion of subjects with plasma HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at Week 48 (Snapshot algorithm) who were randomized and treated.

At baseline, in the pooled analysis, the median age of subjects was 33 years, 15% female, 69% white, 9% were CDC Stage 3 (AIDS), the median plasma HIV-1 RNA was 4.4 log10copies/mL, 20% had HIV-1 RNA > 100,000 copies/mL, the median CD4+cell count was 432 cells/mm3, and 8% had CD4+cell count ≤ 200 cells/mm3; these characteristics were similar between trials and treatment arms within each trial.

Week 144 outcomes (including outcomes by key baseline covariates) for the pooled GEMINI-1 and GEMINI-2 trials are shown in Table 13. The results of the pooled analysis are consistent with the results from the individual trials, for which the secondary endpoint is the difference in proportion of subjects with plasma HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at Week 144 based on the Snapshot algorithm for TIVICAY plus EPIVIR versus TIVICAY plus TRUVADA. The proportions of subjects with plasma HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL in the group receiving TIVICAY plus EPIVIR versus TIVICAY plus TRUVADA were 79% and 83%, respectively, in GEMINI‑1 and 84% in both treatment arms of GEMINI-2. The adjusted difference was -3.6% (95% CI: -9.4%, 2.1) for GEMINI-1 and 0.0% (95% CI: -5.3%, 5.3%) for GEMINI-2. At Week 144, no subjects who met the protocol-defined confirmed virologic withdrawal criteria had any treatment-emergent substitutions associated with resistance to dolutegravir or NRTIs.

The primary endpoint was assessed at Week 48 and the virologic success rate was 91% in the group receiving TIVICAY plus EPIVIR and 93% in the group receiving TIVICAY plus TRUVADA, with a treatment difference of -1.7% (95% CI: -4.4%, 1.1%) in the pooled data. The results of the pooled analysis are similar to the individual trials, for which the primary endpoint (proportion of subjects with plasma HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at Week 48 based on the Snapshot algorithm for TIVICAY plus EPIVIR versus TIVICAY plus TRUVADA) was met. The adjusted difference was -2.6% (95% CI: ‑6.7%, 1.5%) for GEMINI-1 and -0.7% (95% CI: ‑4.3%, 2.9%) for GEMINI-2.

The adjusted mean change from baseline in CD4+cell count based on the pooled analysis at Week 144 was 302 cells/mm3for the group receiving TIVICAY plus EPIVIR and 300 cells/mm3for the group receiving TIVICAY plus TRUVADA.

8.2	Lactation

Risk Summary

Dolutegravir and lamivudine are present in human milk. There is no information on the effects of DOVATO or the components of DOVATO on the breastfed infant or the effects of the drugs on milk production.

Potential risks of breastfeeding include: (1) HIV‑1 transmission (in HIV-1–negative infants), (2) developing viral resistance (in HIV-1–positive infants), and (3) adverse reactions in a breastfed infant similar to those seen in adults.

8.4	Pediatric Use

The safety and efficacy of DOVATO for the treatment of HIV-1 infection have been established in adolescents 12 years of age and older and weighing at least 25 kg. Use of DOVATO for this indication is supported by DANCE trial in treatment-naïve adolescents and evidence from adequate and well-controlled trials in adults, GEMINI-1, GEMINI-2 (treatment-naïve adults) and TANGO (virologically-suppressed adults) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), Clinical Studies (14)]. Overall, the safety and efficacy data in adolescent subjects from the DANCE trial were comparable to those observed in adults, and there was no clinically significant difference in exposure for the components of DOVATO [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), Clinical Studies (14.4)].

The safety and efficacy of DOVATO have not been established in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age or weighing less than 25 kg.

8.5	Geriatric Use

Clinical trials of DOVATO did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, caution should be exercised in the administration of DOVATO in elderly patients reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Clinical Subjects: At Week 144, none of the 12 subjects in the dolutegravir plus lamivudine group or the 9 subjects in the dolutegravir plus TDF/FTC group who met the protocol-defined confirmed virologic withdrawal criteria across the pooled GEMINI-1 and GEMINI-2 trials had emergent INSTI- or NRTI-resistance substitutions.

No subject who received DOVATO in the TANGO trial met the protocol-defined confirmed virologic withdrawal criteria through Week 144. No emergent INSTI- or NRTI-resistance was detected by genotypic or phenotypic analyses of the last on-treatment isolate from one subject who received DOVATO with HIV-1 RNA ≥ 400 copies/mL at withdrawal. No emergent resistance was detected by genotypic or phenotypic analyses of HIV-1 integrase, protease, or reverse transcriptase at the time of virologic failure in 3 subjects in the TBR arm who met the confirmed virologic withdrawal criteria.

Cross-Resistance

Dolutegravir: The susceptibility of dolutegravir was tested against 60 INSTI-resistant site-directed mutant HIV-1 viruses (28 with single substitutions and 32 with 2 or more substitutions). The single INSTI-resistance substitutions T66K, I151L, and S153Y conferred a > 2-fold decrease in dolutegravir susceptibility (range: 2.3-fold to 3.6-fold from reference). Combinations of multiple substitutions T66K/L74M; E92Q/N155H; G140C/Q148R; G140S/Q148H, R or K; Q148R/N155H; T97A/G140S/Q148, and substitutions at E138/G140/Q148 showed a > 2-fold decrease in dolutegravir susceptibility (range: 2.5-fold to 21-fold from reference).

Lamivudine: Cross-resistance conferred by the M184V or I RT has been observed within the NRTI class of antiretroviral agents. The M184V or I substitution confers resistance to emtricitabine and to abacavir, which selects M184V or I plus additional RT substitutions K65R, L74V, and Y115F. Zidovudine maintains its antiretroviral activities against lamivudine-resistant HIV-1. Abacavir and tenofovir maintain antiretroviral activity against lamivudine-resistant HIV-1 harboring only the M184V or I substitution.

7.1	Coadministration with Other Antiretroviral Drugs

DOVATO is a complete regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection; therefore, coadministration with other antiretroviral drugs for the treatment of HIV-1 infection is not recommended [see Indications and Usage (1)]. Information regarding potential drug-drug interactions with other antiretroviral drugs is not provided [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.5), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

7.2	Potential for DOVATO to Affect Other Drugs

Dolutegravir, a component of DOVATO, inhibits the renal organic cation transporters (OCT)2 and multidrug and toxin extrusion transporter (MATE)1; thus, it may increase plasma concentrations of drugs eliminated via OCT2 or MATE1 such as dofetilide, dalfampridine, and metformin [see Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7.4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

7.3	Potential for Other Drugs to Affect the Components of DOVATO

Dolutegravir is metabolized by uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucuronosyl transferase (UGT)1A1 with some contribution from cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A. Dolutegravir is also a substrate of UGT1A3, UGT1A9, breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in vitro. Drugs that induce those enzymes and transporters may decrease dolutegravir plasma concentrations and reduce the therapeutic effect of DOVATO [see Drug Interactions (7.4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Coadministration of DOVATO and other drugs that inhibit these enzymes may increase dolutegravir plasma concentrations.

Coadministration of dolutegravir with polyvalent cation-containing products may lead to decreased absorption of dolutegravir [see Drug Interactions (7.4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

7.4	Established and Other Potentially Significant Drug Interactions

No drug interaction studies were conducted with DOVATO. The drug interactions described are based on studies conducted with dolutegravir or lamivudine when administered alone [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Information regarding potential drug interactions with DOVATO are provided in Table 5. These recommendations are based on either drug interaction trials or predicted interactions due to the expected magnitude of interaction and potential for serious adverse events or loss of efficacy [see Contraindications (4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

The absorption, distribution, and elimination pharmacokinetic parameters of the components of DOVATO are provided in Table 7.

Specific Populations

No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of the components of DOVATO were observed based on age, sex, or race. Pharmacokinetic data for dolutegravir and lamivudine in subjects aged 65 years and older are limited.

Patients with Renal Impairment: The pharmacokinetics for the individual components of DOVATO have been evaluated in patients with renal impairment. See the U.S. prescribing information for the individual components, TIVICAY (dolutegravir) and EPIVIR (lamivudine).

Patients with Hepatic Impairment: The pharmacokinetics for the individual components of DOVATO have been evaluated in patients with varying degrees of hepatic impairment. See the U.S. prescribing information for the individual components, TIVICAY (dolutegravir) and EPIVIR (lamivudine).

Pediatric Subjects: In adolescents receiving DOVATO, dolutegravir and lamivudine exposures were higher as compared to adults; however the differences in exposure were not considered clinically significant. Lamivudine and dolutegravir exposures were within the observed ranges at the recommended doses in adults and pediatrics receiving the individual components of DOVATO (Table 8).

Clinical Trials in Virologically Suppressed Adults

The safety of DOVATO in virologically suppressed adults was based on Week 144 data from 740 subjects in a randomized, parallel-group, open-label, multicenter, non-inferiority controlled trial (TANGO). Subjects who were on a stable suppressive tenofovir alafenamide-based regimen (TBR) were randomized to receive DOVATO once daily or continue with their TBR for up to 148 weeks; at Week 148, the subjects randomized to continue with their TBR were switched to DOVATO once daily. All subjects are followed up to Week 200. Overall, the safety profile of DOVATO in virologically suppressed adult subjects in the TANGO trial was similar to that of TIVICAY plus EPIVIR in subjects with no antiretroviral treatment history in the GEMINI trials [see Clinical Studies (14.3)]. Adverse reactions observed in at least 2% of subjects in the TANGO trial who were treated with DOVATO were weight increased (3%) and insomnia (2%).

Laboratory Abnormalities

Selected laboratory abnormalities with a worsening grade from baseline and representing the worst-grade toxicity are presented in Table 3. The mean change from baseline observed for selected lipid values is presented in Table 4.

Changes in Serum Creatinine: Dolutegravir has been shown to increase serum creatinine due to inhibition of tubular secretion of creatinine without affecting renal glomerular function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Increases in serum creatinine occurred within the first 4 weeks of treatment in both arms and remained stable through 144 weeks. A mean change from baseline of 0.144 mg/dL and 0.176 mg/dL was observed after 144 weeks of treatment with TIVICAY plus EPIVIR and TIVICAY plus TRUVADA, respectively. These changes are not considered to be clinically relevant.

Clinical Trial Experience in Adolescents

The safety of DOVATO was evaluated in HIV-1–infected treatment-naïve subjects between the ages of 12 to less than 18 years and weighing at least 25 kg (N = 32) through Week 48, in an open label clinical trial, DANCE (Trial 205861). Overall, the observed safety profile in adolescent subjects was similar to those seen in adults [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4), and Clinical Studies (14.4)].

6.1	Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.

Clinical Trials in Adults with No Antiretroviral Treatment History

The safety assessment of DOVATO in HIV-1–infected adults with no antiretroviral treatment history and with a plasma viral load ≤ 500,000 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL at the screening visit, is based on the pooled Week 144 analyses of data from 2 identical, multicenter, double-blind, controlled trials, GEMINI-1 and GEMINI-2. A total of 1,433 HIV-1–infected adults with no antiretroviral treatment history received either dolutegravir (TIVICAY) 50 mg plus lamivudine (EPIVIR) 300 mg, as a complete regimen once daily, or TIVICAY 50 mg plus fixed-dose combination tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)/emtricitabine (FTC) (TRUVADA), administered once daily.

The rates of adverse events leading to discontinuation in the pooled analysis were 4% of subjects who received TIVICAY plus EPIVIR and 5% in subjects who received TIVICAY plus TRUVADA. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation were psychiatric disorders: 2% of subjects who received TIVICAY plus EPIVIR and 1% in subjects who received TIVICAY plus TRUVADA.

12.4 Microbiology

Mechanism of Action

Dolutegravir: Dolutegravir inhibits HIV integrase by binding to the integrase active site and blocking the strand transfer step of retroviral DNA integration which is essential for the HIV replication cycle. Strand transfer biochemical assays using purified recombinant HIV‑1 integrase and pre-processed substrate DNA resulted in IC50values of 2.7 nM and 12.6 nM.

Abacavir: Abacavir is a carbocyclic synthetic nucleoside analogue. Abacavir is converted by cellular enzymes to the active metabolite, carbovir triphosphate (CBV‑TP), an analogue of deoxyguanosine‑5′‑triphosphate (dGTP). CBV‑TP inhibits the activity of HIV‑1 reverse transcriptase (RT) both by competing with the natural substrate dGTP and by its incorporation into viral DNA.

Lamivudine: Lamivudine is a synthetic nucleoside analogue. Intracellularly lamivudine is phosphorylated to its active 5′-triphosphate metabolite, lamivudine triphosphate (3TC‑TP). The principal mode of action of 3TC‑TP is inhibition of RT via DNA chain termination after incorporation of the nucleotide analogue.

Antiviral Activity in Cell Culture

Dolutegravir: Dolutegravir exhibited antiviral activity against laboratory strains of wild-type HIV‑1 with mean concentration of drug necessary to affect viral replication by 50% (EC50) values of 0.5 nM (0.21 ng/mL) to 2.1 nM (0.85 ng/mL) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and MT-4 cells. Dolutegravir exhibited antiviral activity against 13 clinically diverse clade B isolates with a median EC50value of 0.54 nM (range: 0.41 to 0.60 nM) in a viral susceptibility assay using the integrase coding region from clinical isolates. Dolutegravir demonstrated antiviral activity in cell culture against a panel of HIV‑1 clinical isolates with median EC50values of 0.18 nM (n = 3, range: 0.09 to 0.5 nM), 0.08 nM (n = 5, range: 0.05 to 2.14 nM), 0.12 nM (n = 4, range: 0.05 to 0.51 nM), 0.17 nM (n = 3, range: 0.16 to 0.35 nM), 0.24 nM (n = 3, range: 0.09 to 0.32 nM), 0.17 nM (n = 4, range: 0.07 to 0.44 nM), 0.2 nM (n = 3, range: 0.02 to 0.87 nM), and 0.42 nM (n = 3, range: 0.41 to 1.79 nM) for clades A, B, C, D, E, F, and G, and group O viruses, respectively. Dolutegravir EC50values against three HIV-2 clinical isolates in PBMC assays ranged from 0.09 nM to 0.61 nM.

Objective

To review data on efficacy and safety of dolutegravir (DTG) and lamivudine (3TC) in treatment-naïve adults with HIV-1 infection.

Data Sources

Phase III clinical trials and review articles were identified through PubMed (1996 to March 2020) and ClinicalTrials.gov (2000 to May 2020) using the keywords dolutegravir, lamivudine, and HIV.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Relevant clinical trials and review articles available in English evaluating efficacy and safety of DTG and 3TC were included.

Data Synthesis

The once-daily, single-tablet regimen of DTG/3TC is the first dual antiretroviral therapy (ART) recommended for initial therapy in treatment-naïve adults with HIV-1 infection. DTG and 3TC were compared with a regimen of DTG and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine in the GEMINI studies and demonstrated noninferiority for the primary end point of virological suppression at up to 96 weeks. No treatment-emergent resistance mutations were identified in a small group of participants who did not reach virological suppression. The regimen is well tolerated, and the most common adverse events reported in trials include headache, diarrhea, nausea, insomnia, and fatigue.

Relevance To Patient Care and Clinical Practice

This dual-ART regimen is a favorable treatment option for ART-naïve patients with HIV-1 RNA < 500 000 copies/mL, absence of hepatitis B virus, and no resistance to DTG or 3TC. Benefits of dual ART include reduction in treatment-related adverse events and toxicities, drug interactions, and cost. In addition, the once-daily, single-tablet formulation promotes adherence.

Conclusions

DTG/3TC has demonstrated efficacy in maintaining virological suppression in ART-naïve patients at up to 96 weeks while minimizing treatment-related adverse events and toxicities.

Methods

Study identification

A systematic literature search was performed on 4 December 2018 using PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane databases to update an original literature search conducted in 2013. The aim of the search was to identify Phase 3/4 RCTs evaluating the efficacy and/or safety of DTG + 3TC and/or guideline-recommended 3-drug regimens in treatment-naive patients with HIV-1 (search terms can be found in Supplementary Table 1). In addition, the National Institute of Health clinical trial (NCT) registry database, US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval summaries, European Medicines Agency, European Public Assessment Reports scientific discussions and package inserts of the treatments of interest were also systematically searched. Study selection was performed as previously described.

Eligible publications were Phase 3/4 RCTs of 48 or 96 weeks' duration, conducted in treatment-naive adults or adolescents (≥ 13 years of age) with HIV-1 infection, published in English, including a regimen of interest, and reporting at least one of the efficacy or safety endpoints of interest. Regimens of interest were those containing recommended core agents from the DHHS and EACS clinical guidelines (up to October 2018) and the new INSTI bictegravir (BIC). Efavirenz (EFV) + TDF/FTC was also included to facilitate the formation of a connected network. The quality of the studies selected for inclusion in the NMA was assessed based on study design, confounders, blinding, data collection methods, withdrawals, and dropouts, using the Effective Public Health Practice Project Quality Assessment (EPHPP) tool.

The study was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines.

Outcomes

Efficacy

The primary efficacy outcome was the proportion of patients with virologic suppression at Week 48. In accordance with FDA guidance, virologic suppression was defined as (in order of preference): FDA Snapshot-50, time to loss of virologic response-50, confirmed virologic response-50, and HIV RNA less than 50 copies/ml. The secondary efficacy outcome was the mean increase in CD4 + cell count from baseline to Week 48. Analysis of the primary outcome was also undertaken in the subgroup of patients with baseline viral load more than 100 000 RNA copies/ml.

Safety

Safety (secondary outcomes) were the proportions of patients with adverse events, serious adverse events, and drug-related adverse events by Week 48.

Given the clinical importance of the potential for reduced toxicity with 2-drug regimens over 3-drug regimens, signs of a paradigm shift from 3-drug to 2-drug regimens, and the inclusion of DTG + 3TC in the guidelines, it is important to determine the efficacy and safety of DTG + 3TC compared with traditional 3-drug ART regimens. Therefore, this network meta-analysis (NMA) was undertaken to compare the efficacy and safety of DTG + 3TC with traditional 3-drug regimens in treatment-naive patients with HIV-1, with the aim of providing clinically relevant data to support prescribing choices in this patient population.

5.2 Patients Co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV: Emergence of Lamivudine-Resistant HBV and the Risk of Posttreatment Exacerbations of HBV

All patients with HIV-1 should be tested for the presence of HBV prior to or when initiating TRIUMEQ or TRIUMEQ PD.

Emergence of Lamivudine Resistant HBV

Safety and efficacy of lamivudine have not been established for treatment of chronic HBV in subjects dually infected with HIV-1 and HBV. Emergence of HBV variants associated with resistance to lamivudine has been reported in HIV‑1−infected subjects who have received lamivudine‑containing antiretroviral regimens in the presence of concurrent infection with HBV. If a decision is made to administer TRIUMEQ or TRIUMEQ PD to patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV, additional treatment should be considered for appropriate treatment of chronic HBV; otherwise, consider an alternative regimen.

Severe Acute Exacerbations of HBV in Patients Co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV

Severe acute exacerbations of HBV have been reported in patients who are co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV and have discontinued products containing lamivudine, and may occur with discontinuation of TRIUMEQ or TRIUMEQ PD. Patients who are co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV who discontinue TRIUMEQ or TRIUMEQ PD should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment with TRIUMEQ or TRIUMEQ PD. If appropriate, initiation of anti-HBV therapy may be warranted, especially in patients with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis since posttreatment exacerbation of hepatitis may lead to hepatic decompensation and liver failure.

5.3 Hepatotoxicity

Hepatic adverse events have been reported in patients receiving a dolutegravir-containing regimen [see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)]. Patients with underlying hepatitis B or C may be at increased risk for worsening or development of transaminase elevations with use of TRIUMEQ or TRIUMEQ PD [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In some cases, the elevations in transaminases were consistent with immune reconstitution syndrome or hepatitis B reactivation particularly in the setting where anti-hepatitis therapy was withdrawn. Cases of hepatic toxicity, including elevated serum liver biochemistries, hepatitis, and acute liver failure, have also been reported in patients, including pediatric patients receiving a dolutegravir-containing regimen who had no pre-existing hepatic disease or other identifiable risk factors. Drug-induced liver injury leading to liver transplant has been reported with TRIUMEQ. Monitoring for hepatotoxicity is recommended.

Introduction

Combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) is the standard of care for treatment-naive patients with HIV infection, allowing them to achieve and maintain long-term virologic suppression and achieve a life expectancy similar to that of the general population. Despite their efficacy, many ART agents are associated with well established risks of long-term toxicities, including coronary disease, osteoporosis, renal failure or chronic kidney disease, and diabetes. The high prevalence of comorbidities associated with HIV leads to polypharmacy, increasing the risk of drug–drug interactions and severe complications.

Combination ART traditionally comprises a 3-drug regimen of three active agents from two drug classes – two nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and a non-NRTI core agent selected from one of the following drug classes: an integrase strand inhibitor (INSTI), a boosted protease inhibitor, or a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI). For treatment-naive patients with HIV, INSTIs are the preferred core agent according to the European AIDS Clinical Society (EACS) guidelines, a preferred option according to the US Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) guidelines, and a regimen based on the INSTI dolutegravir (DTG) is recommended first line by the WHO.

Given the lifelong nature of HIV treatment and the potential toxicities associated with ART, 2-drug ART regimens that minimize cumulative drug exposure while maintaining the efficacy of 3-drug regimens are of interest. In treatment-naive patients with HIV-1, the 2-drug regimen DTG + lamivudine (3TC) was investigated in two single-arm, pilot studies, and two large, multicenter, Phase III, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) – GEMINI-1 and GEMINI-2. In the GEMINI studies, DTG + 3TC was noninferior to DTG + tenofovir disoproxyl fumarate/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) in terms of the proportions of treatment-naive patients achieving virologic suppression at Week 48 [91 versus 93%, respectively; treatment difference −1.7, 95% confidence intervals (CI): −4.4, 1.1], with a similar safety profile. Based on these data, the 2018 guidelines from the US DHHS and EACS recommend the 2-drug regimen of DTG + 3TC as an alternative first-line regimen for treatment-naïve adults with HIV.

1 Introduction

The 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) antiretroviral therapy (ART) consolidated guidelines on the use of antiretrovirals for treating and preventing HIV included a strong recommendation for the combination of efavirenz, tenofovir disoproxil and lamivudine (or emtricitabine) [EFV+TDF+3TC/FTC] as the preferred first-line ART regimen. The supporting evidence synthesis suggested favourable efficacy, tolerability and safety of dolutegravir (DTG) relative to EFV and improved tolerability with low-dose efavirenz (EFV 400). Nonetheless, DTG and EFV 400 based regimens were recommended as alternative first-line regimens. A lack of data among pregnant and breastfeeding women, TB-HIV co-infected persons and other sub-populations – as well as a higher price for DTG – did not allow for a change in recommendation that would align with the public health framework. This framework aims to keep the guidance as simple as possible in order to facilitate task-shifting and other strategies to optimize the ART scale-up in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Improvements in potency, tolerability, simplicity and availability of first-line ART have not only resulted in increased life expectancy and quality of life for people living with HIV (PLWH), but also in improved public health through reduced HIV transmissions among virally suppressed PLWH. To this end, the ongoing ART scale-up in LMICs has played a critical role in the fight against HIV/AIDSand the WHO consolidated guidelines are influential in this regard.

Dolutegravir dosing in renal impairment — DTG decreases tubular secretion of creatinine and increases measured serum creatinine without affecting glomerular filtration; no dose adjustment is required in INSTI-naive patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment, or in INSTI-experienced patients with mild or moderate renal impairment; use DTG with caution in INSTI-experienced patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CrCl] < 30 mL/min), because DTG concentrations will be decreased; FDC tablets containing 3TC (Dovato, Triumeq PD, and Triumeq) should not be used in patients who have CrCl < 30 mL/min or patients who are on dialysis because the doses of 3TC cannot be adjusted; data about the FDC DTG/3TC (Dovato) suggest that patients with a sustained creatinine clearance 30–49 mL/min may experience a higher 3TC exposure and should be monitored for hematologic toxicities and potential FDC discontinuation and subsequent adjustment of the treatment regimen.

### Three-year durable efficacy of dolutegravir plus lamivudine in antiretroviral therapy-naive adults with HIV-1 infection [^260e075a]. AIDS (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To assess efficacy and safety of dolutegravir (DTG) + lamivudine (3TC) vs. DTG + tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) in treatment-naive adults with HIV-1 in the prespecified 144-week secondary analyses of GEMINI-1 and GEMINI-2.

Design

Identical, multicenter, phase III, randomized, non-inferiority studies (double-blind through 96weeks).

Methods

Participants with HIV-1 RNA ≤ 500000copies/ml and no major viral resistance mutations to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, or protease inhibitors were randomized 1:1 to once-daily DTG + 3TC or DTG + TDF/FTC.

Results

At week 144, DTG + 3TC (N = 716) was noninferior to DTG + TDF/FTC (N = 717) in proportion of participants achieving HIV-1 RNA < 50copies/ml (Snapshot algorithm) in the pooled analysis (82% vs. 84%, respectively; adjusted treatment difference [95% confidence interval (CI)], -1.8% [-5.8, 2.1]), GEMINI-1 (-3.6% [-9.4, 2.1]), and GEMINI-2 (0.0% [-5.3, 5.3]). Twelve DTG + 3TC participants and nine DTG + TDF/FTC participants met protocol-defined confirmed virologic withdrawal (CVW) criteria; none developed treatment-emergent resistance. One DTG + 3TC participant who did not meet CVW criteria developed M184V at week 132 and R263R/K at week 144, conferring a 1.8-fold change in susceptibility to DTG; non-adherence to therapy was reported. Significantly fewer drug-related adverse events occurred with DTG + 3TC vs. DTG + TDF/FTC (20% vs. 27%; relative risk [95% CI], 0.76 [0.63–0.92]). Renal and bone biomarker changes favored DTG + 3TC.

Conclusions

Three-year durable efficacy, long-term tolerability, and high barrier to resistance support first-line use of DTG + 3TC for HIV-1 treatment (see Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/QAD/C297; video abstract).

### Dolutegravir plus lamivudine versus dolutegravir plus tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine in antiretroviral-naive adults with HIV-1 infection (GEMINI-1 and GEMINI-2): week 48 results from two multicentre, double-blind, randomised, non-inferiority, phase 3 trials [^e0ca4c9a]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Background

Effective two-drug regimens could decrease long-term drug exposure and toxicity with HIV-1 antiretroviral therapy (ART). We therefore aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a two-drug regimen compared with a three-drug regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in ART-naive adults.

Methods

We conducted two identically designed, multicentre, double-blind, randomised, non-inferiority, phase 3 trials: GEMINI-1 and GEMINI-2. Both studies were done at 192 centres in 21 countries. We included participants (≥ 18 years) with HIV-1 infection and a screening HIV-1 RNA of 500000 copies per mL or less, and who were naive to ART. We randomly assigned participants (1:1) to receive a once-daily two-drug regimen of dolutegravir (50 mg) plus lamivudine (300 mg) or a once-daily three-drug regimen of dolutegravir (50 mg) plus tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (300 mg) and emtricitabine (200 mg). Both drug regimens were administered orally. We masked participants and investigators to treatment assignment: dolutegravir was administered as single-entity tablets (similar to its commercial formulation, except with a different film colour), and lamivudine tablets and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine tablets were over-encapsulated to visually match each other. Primary endpoint was the proportion of participants with HIV-1 RNA of less than 50 copies per mL at week 48 in the intention-to-treat-exposed population, using the Snapshot algorithm and a non-inferiority margin of -10%. Safety analyses were done on the safety population. GEMINI-1 and GEMINI-2 are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, numbers NCT02831673 and NCT02831764, respectively.

Findings

Between July 18, 2016, and March 31, 2017, 1441 participants across both studies were randomly assigned to receive either the two-drug regimen (n = 719) or three-drug regimen (n = 722). At week 48 in the GEMINI-1 intention-to-treat-exposed population, 320 (90%) of 356 participants receiving the two-drug regimen and 332 (93%) of 358 receiving the three-drug regimen achieved plasma HIV-1 RNA of less than 50 copies per mL (adjusted treatment difference -2·6%, 95% CI -6·7 to 1·5); in GEMINI-2, 335 (93%) of 360 in the two-drug regimen and 337 (94%) of 359 in the three-drug regimen achieved HIV-1 RNA of less than 50 copies per mL (adjusted treatment difference -0·7%, 95% CI -4·3 to 2·9), showing non-inferiority at a -10% margin in both studies (pooled analysis: 655 [91%] of 716 in the two-drug regimen vs 669 [93%] of 717 in the three-drug regimen; adjusted treatment difference -1·7%, 95% CI -4·4 to 1·1). Numerically, more drug-related adverse events occurred with the three-drug regimen than with the two-drug regimen (169 [24%] of 717 vs 126 [18%] of 716); few participants discontinued because of adverse events (16 [2%] in the three-drug regimen and 15 [2%] in the two-drug regimen). Two deaths were reported in the two-drug regimen group of GEMINI-2, but neither was considered to be related to the study medication.

Interpretation

The non-inferior efficacy and similar tolerability profile of dolutegravir plus lamivudine to a guideline-recommended three-drug regimen at 48 weeks in ART-naive adults supports its use as initial therapy for patients with HIV-1 infection.

Introduction

Timely access to care after initial HIV diagnosis is critical to successful HIV treatment. Despite wide availability of antiretroviral therapy (ART), the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that only 80% of people diagnosed with HIV in the United States in 2018 were linked to HIV medical care 1 month or less post-diagnosis.

One strategy to improve linkage of people living with HIV (PWH) to HIV care is initiation of ART immediately after a reactive HIV test, referred to as test-and-treat. The 2019 update to the Department of Health and Human Services Panel on Antiretroviral Guidelines for Adults and Adolescents also recommends initiating ART at diagnosis (when possible) or soon afterward to increase ART uptake, reduce time to linkage to care and virologic suppression, and improve virologic suppression rates in recently diagnosed individuals. Despite these recommendations, several barriers can prevent rapid ART initiation, including clinical conditions requiring management beforehand and concerns regarding transmitted drug resistance.

Prevalence of transmitted integrase strand transfer inhibitor and lamivudine (3TC) resistance-associated mutations is low, occurring in up to 1% of ART-naive individuals. These estimates are consistent with observations from the GEMINI-1/GEMINI-2 studies (conducted in 21 countries) in which three of 1974 (0.15%) participants failed screening because of transmitted M184V resistance.

Dolutegravir/3TC (DTG/3TC) is a two-drug fixed-dose combination (FDC) tablet regimen indicated for treatment-naive PWH or those who are virologically suppressed on a stable ART regimen with no history of treatment failure and no known or suspected resistance to the individual components. Through 144 weeks of the identically designed, phase III GEMINI trials, DTG + 3TC demonstrated non-inferior virologic efficacy, similar numbers of participants meeting virologic failure criteria, and similar safety and tolerability profiles compared with the three-drug regimen DTG + tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine (FTC) in ART-naive PWH. However, questions remain about its utility for rapid initiation due to potential transmitted resistance, baseline hepatitis B virus (HBV) co-infection, and high viral load.

### Three-year durable efficacy of dolutegravir plus lamivudine in antiretroviral therapy-naive adults with HIV-1 infection [^b57394ce]. AIDS (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

GEMINI-1 (NCT02831673) and GEMINI-2 (NCT02831764) are identical, multicenter, phase III, randomized, non-inferiority studies that were double-blind through 96 weeks and conducted at 187 centers in 21 countries. Protocols for GEMINI-1 and GEMINI-2 are available atand, respectively. Methods, including ethical compliance information, have previously been published and are described briefly below.

After screening, eligible participants aged ≥ 18 years with HIV-1 infection, ≤ 10 days of prior antiretroviral therapy (ART), and screening plasma HIV-1 RNA 1000–500 000 copies/ml were randomized 1:1 to receive a once-daily 2DR of DTG 50 mg + 3TC 300 mg or a once-daily 3DR of DTG 50 mg plus TDF 300 mg/FTC 200 mg. Participants were stratified by screening HIV-1 RNA (≤ 100 000 or > 100 000 copies/ml) and screening CD4 + cell count (≤ 200 or > 200 cells/cells/μl) and treated in a double-blind randomized phase from day 1 to week 96, followed by an open-label randomized phase from week 96 to week 148. Adverse events (AEs) and laboratory assessments were performed through week 148, whereas other assessments were generally conducted through week 144; HIV-1 RNA was assessed at week 144, with re-testing occurring at week 148 for participants with HIV-1 RNA ≥ 50 copies/ml at the week 144 visit.

Plasma for HIV-1 RNA analysis was collected at baseline and weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 36, 48, and every 12 weeks thereafter until week 144 and quantitated using the Abbott RealTime HIV-1 assay (Abbott Molecular, Des Plaines, Illinois, USA). Participants met CVW criteria if a second and consecutive HIV-1 RNA value met any of the following: decrease from baseline in plasma HIV-1 RNA < 1 log 10 copies/ml, unless HIV-1 RNA < 200 copies/ml, by week 12; confirmed plasma HIV-1 RNA ≥ 200 copies/ml at or after week 24; or plasma HIV-1 RNA ≥ 200 copies/ml after previous confirmed suppression to HIV-1 RNA < 200 copies/ml. Participants who met CVW criteria discontinued the study, and plasma samples from day 1 and the initial elevated viral load sample were used for genotypic and phenotypic resistance tests (Monogram Biosciences, San Francisco, California, USA).

Lamivudine (3TC) administration and special instructions include that 3TC and coformulated tablets can be given with and without food and that the 3TC oral solution should be stored at room temperature. For abacavir (ABC)/dolutegravir (DTG)/3TC dispersible tablets, fully disperse them in 20 mL of drinking water and administer after full dispersion and within 30 minutes of mixing; ABC/DTG/3TC dispersible tablets should not be swallowed whole, chewed, cut, or crushed. Screen patients for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection before using 3TC or fixed-dose combination (FDC) tablets that contain 3TC, and hepatic function and HBV viral load should be monitored for several months after patients with HBV infection stop taking 3TC; patients with HBV/HIV coinfection who receive Dovato will require additional treatment for chronic HBV infection. For any FDC tablet containing abacavir, test for the HLA-B✱5701 allele before starting therapy; patients who test positive for HLA-B✱5701 should not be given an ABC-containing FDC, and patients with no prior HLA-B✱5701 testing who are tolerating an ABC-containing regimen do not need to be tested.

Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported and were characterized by rash, constitutional findings, and sometimes organ dysfunction, including liver injury. The events were reported in < 1% of subjects receiving TIVICAY in Phase 3 clinical trials. Discontinue TRIUMEQ or TRIUMEQ PD and other suspect agents immediately if signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions develop (including, but not limited to, severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters or peeling of the skin, oral blisters or lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, hepatitis, eosinophilia, angioedema, difficulty breathing). Clinical status, including liver aminotransferases, should be monitored and appropriate therapy initiated. Delay in stopping treatment with TRIUMEQ or TRIUMEQ PD or other suspect agents after the onset of hypersensitivity may result in a life-threatening reaction.

Clinically, it is not possible to determine whether a hypersensitivity reaction with TRIUMEQ or TRIUMEQ PD would be caused by abacavir or dolutegravir. Therefore, never restart TRIUMEQ or TRIUMEQ PD or any other abacavir- or dolutegravir-containing product in patients who have stopped therapy with TRIUMEQ or TRIUMEQ PD due to a hypersensitivity reaction.

### Efficacy and safety of switching to dolutegravir / lamivudine fixed-dose 2-drug regimen vs continuing a tenofovir alafenamide-based 3-or 4-drug regimen for maintenance of virologic suppression in adults living with human immunodeficiency virus type 1: phase 3, randomized, noninferiority TANGO study [^703fe9c0]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The 2-drug regimen dolutegravir (DTG) + lamivudine (3TC) is indicated for treatment-naive adults with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). We present efficacy and safety of switching to DTG/3TC in virologically suppressed individuals.

Methods

TANGO is an open-label, multicenter, phase 3 study that randomized adults (1:1, stratified by baseline third agent class) with HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL to switch to once-daily fixed-dose DTG/3TC or remain on a tenofovir alafenamide (TAF)-based regimen. The primary end point was proportion of participants with HIV-1 RNA ≥ 50 copies/mL at week 48 (US Food and Drug Administration Snapshot algorithm) in the intention-to-treat-exposed population (4% noninferiority margin).

Results

743 adults were enrolled; 741 received ≥ 1 dose of study drug (DTG/3TC, N = 369; TAF-based regimen, N = 372). At week 48, proportion of participants with HIV-1 RNA ≥ 50 copies/mL receiving DTG/3TC was 0.3% (1/369) vs 0.5% (2/372) with a TAF-based regimen (adjusted treatment difference [95% confidence interval], -0.3 [-1.2 to .7]), meeting noninferiority criteria. No participants receiving DTG/3TC and 1 receiving a TAF-based regimen met confirmed virologic withdrawal criteria, with no emergent resistance at failure. Drug-related grade ≥ 2 adverse events and withdrawals due to adverse events occurred in 17 (4.6%) and 13 (3.5%) participants with DTG/3TC and 3 (0.8%) and 2 (0.5%) with a TAF-based regimen, respectively.

Conclusions

DTG/3TC was noninferior in maintaining virologic suppression vs a TAF-based regimen at week 48, with no virologic failure or emergent resistance reported with DTG/3TC, supporting it as a simplification strategy for virologically suppressed people with HIV-1.

### Approaches to the management of virologic failure on dolutegravir-based antiretroviral therapy in the 50 countries with the highest adult HIV prevalence [^2776fc9a]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Expanded access to dolutegravir as part of a fixed-dose combination with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and lamivudine (TLD) has revolutionized global HIV treatment, with more than 25 million people prescribed this regimen in 2024. We reviewed national clinical guidelines for management of virologic failure on first-line TLD in the 50 countries with the highest prevalence of HIV among adults; recent guidelines were not available online for four. Among the remaining 46 country guidelines, we identified four distinct approaches: 1) empiric switch to a protease inhibitor (PI)-based regimen without genotypic resistance testing (GRT) (n = 28; 61%); 2) GRT to guide antiretroviral therapy selection (n = 14; 30%); 3) continuation of TLD without GRT (n = 3; 7%); and 4) empiric switch to a PI-based regimen with concurrent GRT (n = 1; 2%). The diversity of guideline-endorsed approaches underscores the critical need for additional data to inform policy regarding this important clinical scenario.

Lamivudine (3TC) with dolutegravir (DTG) — single nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) use and initial regimen recommendation — is supported as follows: Based on data showing DTG plus 3TC non-inferior to DTG plus TDF/FTC in antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naive people with HIV RNA < 500,000 copies/mL, 3TC may be used as a single NRTI with DTG. 3TC with DTG is available as a STR. 3TC is active against HBV but is insufficient for HBV treatment when used alone due to the emergence of resistance, and discontinuation of 3TC can precipitate a flare in HBV if no other HBV-active drugs are in the regimen. 3TC is available in two brand-name formulations (one for HIV and the other for HBV), but the doses are different, and the dose for HIV treatment is 3TC 300 mg daily. See Appendix B for dosing recommendations in people with renal impairment. Sorbitol-containing drugs can decrease 3TC concentration, and coadministration should be avoided. The Panel recommends the use of DTG/3TC (AI) as a Recommended Initial Regimen for Most People With HIV, with four exceptions, and the page notes "DTG/3TC is not recommended for:".

### Efficacy and safety of switching to dolutegravir / lamivudine versus continuing a tenofovir alafenamide-based 3-or 4-drug regimen for maintenance of virologic suppression in adults living with human immunodeficiency virus type 1: results through week 144 from the phase 3, noninferiority TANGO randomized trial [^0e2654a0]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Switching to dolutegravir/lamivudine (DTG/3TC) was noninferior to continuing tenofovir alafenamide (TAF)-based regimens for maintaining virologic suppression at week 48 of the TANGO study. Here we present week 144 outcomes (efficacy, safety, weight, and biomarkers).

Methods

TANGO is a randomized (1:1, stratified by baseline third agent class), open-label, noninferiority phase 3 study. Virologically suppressed (> 6 months) adults with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) switched to once-daily DTG/3TC or continued TAF-based regimens.

Results

A total of 741 participants received study treatment (DTG/3TC, n = 369; TAF-based regimen, n = 372). At week 144, the proportion of participants with an HIV-1 RNA level ≥ 50 copies/mL (primary end point, Snapshot; intention-to-treat-exposed population) after switching to DTG/3TC was 0.3% (1 of 369) versus 1.3% (5 of 372) for those continuing TAF-based regimens, demonstrating noninferiority (adjusted treatment difference, -1.1 [95% confidence interval, -2.4 to .2), with DTG/3TC favored in the per-protocol analysis (adjusted treatment difference, -1.1 [-2.3 to -.0]; P = 0.04). Few participants met confirmed virologic withdrawal criteria (none in the DTG/3TC and 3 in the TAF-based regimen group), with no resistance observed. Drug-related adverse events were more frequent with DTG/3TC (15%; leading to discontinuation in 4%) than TAF-based regimens (5%; leading to discontinuation in 1%) through week 144, but rates were comparable after week 48 (4%; leading to discontinuation in 1% in both groups). Changes from baseline in lipid values generally favored DTG/3TC; no clinical impact on renal function and comparable changes in inflammatory and bone biomarkers across groups were observed.

Conclusions

Switching to DTG/3TC demonstrated noninferior and durable efficacy compared with continuing TAF-based regimens in treatment-experienced adults with HIV-1, with good safety and tolerability, and no resistance through 144 weeks.

### What if HIV were unable to develop resistance against a new therapeutic agent? [^b3581bde]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Summary

Dolutegravir is a welcome addition to the anti-HIV armamentarium of drugs and has shown unprecedented benefit to patients who have taken it as part of a first-line therapeutic regimen. Until now, no resistance mutation has developed either against DTG or any of the drugs used together with it in first-line therapy, and supportive tissue culture data have shown that the development of an initial HIV resistance mutation against DTG may result in a virus with greatly diminished replicative fitness. It is possible that DTG will lend itself to use in a variety of HIV prevention strategies, such as Treatment as Prevention, and that it might possibly also be used in efforts designed to accomplish a cure for HIV infection.

### Efficacy and safety of dual therapy with dolutegravir / lamivudine in treatment-naive persons with CD4 counts [^685e6d15]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Dolutegravir (DTG)/lamivudine dual therapy (DT) has demonstrated noninferiority to triple therapy (TT) in the GEMINI trials. Although the population with ≤ 200 CD4cells/mm3 had a lower response rate, this was unrelated to virological failure. This trial evaluated the antiviral activity of dolutegravir/lamivudine among antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naive patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) with a CD4 count ≤ 200cells/mm3.

Methods

DOLCE is a randomized, hypothesis-based, open-label, multicenter study l, assessing the antiviral efficacy of DTG/3TC at week 48 in treatment-naive people with HIV (PWH) with CD4 counts ≤ 200cells/mm3. Participants were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive DTG/3TC as a single tablet regimen or DTG plus Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)/XTC: Emtricitabine or lamivudine (FTC or 3TC). The primary endpoint was the proportion of participants with pVL < 50copies/mL at week 48 (Food and Drug Administration snapshot analysis intent-to-treat exposed population). This report presents results at week 48.

Results

Baseline characteristics were similar in both arms. In the DT arm, median CD4 cell count was 109cells/mm (interquartile range [IQR]: 49–177) and median pVL was 180,000copies/mL (IQR: 53 309–468 691); 45.4% had CD4 < 100cells/mm3, and 61.4% had pVL > 100 000copies/mL. CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) stage C: 31.4%. At week 48, virological suppression (pVL < 50copies/mL) was achieved 82.2% in the DT (125/152), and the CD4 count increased by +200cells/mm3. Per-protocol analysis showed a response rate of 91.9%. Severe adverse events (n = 17) were reported in 15 of 152 participants (11.1%).

Conclusions

Dolutegravir/3TC demonstrated high efficacy in a population with low CD4 counts and high viral load. This study adds information regarding the efficacy and safety of DTG/3TC, regardless of baseline CD4 counts and viral load.

Abstract

Background

Switching to dolutegravir/lamivudine (DTG/3TC) was noninferior to continuing tenofovir alafenamide (TAF)–based regimens for maintaining virologic suppression at week 48 of the TANGO study. Here we present week 144 outcomes (efficacy, safety, weight, and biomarkers).

Methods

TANGO is a randomized (1:1, stratified by baseline third agent class), open-label, noninferiority phase 3 study. Virologically suppressed (> 6 months) adults with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) switched to once-daily DTG/3TC or continued TAF-based regimens.

Results

A total of 741 participants received study treatment (DTG/3TC, n = 369; TAF-based regimen, n = 372). At week 144, the proportion of participants with an HIV-1 RNA level ≥ 50 copies/mL (primary end point, Snapshot; intention-to-treat–exposed population) after switching to DTG/3TC was 0.3% (1 of 369) versus 1.3% (5 of 372) for those continuing TAF-based regimens, demonstrating noninferiority (adjusted treatment difference, −1.1 [95% confidence interval, −2.4 to.2), with DTG/3TC favored in the per-protocol analysis (adjusted treatment difference, −1.1 [−2.3 to −.0]; P = 0.04). Few participants met confirmed virologic withdrawal criteria (none in the DTG/3TC and 3 in the TAF-based regimen group), with no resistance observed. Drug-related adverse events were more frequent with DTG/3TC (15%; leading to discontinuation in 4%) than TAF-based regimens (5%; leading to discontinuation in 1%) through week 144, but rates were comparable after week 48 (4%; leading to discontinuation in 1% in both groups). Changes from baseline in lipid values generally favored DTG/3TC; no clinical impact on renal function and comparable changes in inflammatory and bone biomarkers across groups were observed.

Conclusions

Switching to DTG/3TC demonstrated noninferior and durable efficacy compared with continuing TAF-based regimens in treatment-experienced adults with HIV-1, with good safety and tolerability, and no resistance through 144 weeks.

Screen for the HLA‑B*5701 allele prior to initiating therapy with TRIUMEQ or TRIUMEQ PD [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

2.2 Testing prior to or When Initiating Treatment with TRIUMEQ

Prior to or when initiating TRIUMEQ or TRIUMEQ PD, test patients for HBV infection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

2.3 Overview of TRIUMEQ Dosage Forms

TRIUMEQ is available in two dosage forms. Do not substitute TRIUMEQ tablets and TRIUMEQ PD tablets for oral suspension on a milligram-per-milligram basis due to differing pharmacokinetic profiles for the dolutegravir component [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

TRIUMEQ tablets: 600 mg of abacavir, 50 mg of dolutegravir, and 300 mg of lamivudine. TRIUMEQ is recommended in adults and pediatric patients weighing at least 25 kg [see Dosage and Administration (2.4, 2.5)].
TRIUMEQ PD tablets for oral suspension: 60 mg of abacavir, 5 mg of dolutegravir, and 30 mg of lamivudine. TRIUMEQ PD is recommended in pediatric patients weighing 6 kg to less than 25 kg [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].
Because TRIUMEQ PD is a fixed-dose tablet and the dosage of individual components cannot be adjusted, it may lead to a suboptimal dosing for patients weighing ≥ 25 kg. TRIUMEQ PD is not recommended in patients weighing 25 kg or more [see Dosage and Administration (2.4, 2.5)].

2.4 Recommended Dosage in Adults

TRIUMEQ is a fixed-dose combination product containing 600 mg of abacavir, 50 mg of dolutegravir, and 300 mg of lamivudine. The recommended dosage regimen of TRIUMEQ in adults is one tablet once daily orally with or without food. Do not use TRIUMEQ PD in adults.

### Comparative efficacy, tolerability and safety of dolutegravir and efavirenz 400mg among antiretroviral therapies for first-line HIV treatment: a systematic literature review and network meta-analysis [^07bb29ee]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

To inform World Health Organization (WHO) global guidelines, we updated and expanded the evidence base to assess the comparative efficacy, tolerability, and safety of first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens.

Methods

We searched Embase, Medline and CENTRAL on 28 February 2020 to update the systematic literature review of clinical trials comparing recommended first-line ART that informed previous WHO guidelines. Outcomes included viral suppression, change in CD4 cell counts, mortality, serious and overall adverse events (AEs), discontinuation, discontinuations due to AEs (DAEs); and new outcomes: drug-resistance, neuropsychiatric AEs, early viral suppression, weight gain and birth outcomes. Comparative effects were assessed through network meta-analyses and certainty in the evidence was assessed using the GRADE framework.

Findings

We identified 156 publications pertaining to 68 trials for the primary population. Relative to efavirenz, dolutegravir had improved odds of viral suppression across all time points (odds ratio [OR]: 1·94; 95% credible interval [CrI]: 1·48–2·56 at 96 weeks); was protective of drug-resistance (OR: 0·13; 95%CrI: 0·04–0·48); and led to fewer discontinuations (OR: 0·58; 95%CrI: 0·48–0·70). Evidence supported dolutegravir use among TB-HIV co-infected persons and pregnant women. Adverse birth outcomes were observed in 33.2% of dolutegravir-managed pregnancies and 35.0% of efavirenz-managed pregnancies. Low-dose efavirenz had comparable efficacy and safety to standard-dose efavirenz, but led to fewer DAEs (OR: 0·70; 95%CrI: 0·50–0·92).

Interpretation

The evidence supports choosing dolutegravir in combination with lamivudine/emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate as the preferred first-line regimen and low-dose efavirenz-based regimens as an alternative. Dolutegravir can be considered to be effective, safe and tolerable.

Dolutegravir plus lamivudine (3TC) or emtricitabine (FTC) — as a maintenance strategy after suppression — was noninferior to continuing a three-drug therapy in a large randomized clinical trial (TANGO), in smaller clinical trials, and in observational studies (AI) among people with ongoing virologic suppression and no history of prior virologic failure or resistance to these agents. Individuals with active HBV infection need to be on a potent HBV drug with a high barrier to resistance (i.e. TAF, TDF, or entecavir), and 3TC or FTC monotherapy is not considered standard of care for HBV treatment because of a high risk of emerging resistance.

### Comparative efficacy and safety and dolutegravir and lamivudine in treatment naive HIV patients [^06ca832f]. AIDS (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The NMA was carried out to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the 2-drug regimen DTG + 3TC relative to traditional 3-drug regimens in treatment-naive patients with HIV-1. DTG + 3TC was similar to 3-drug regimens in terms of virologic suppression, change in CD4 + cell count from baseline, and safety at Week 48 weeks. Results were consistent in the subgroup of difficult-to-treat patients with high baseline viral load (> 100 000 RNA copies/ml). These findings support the use of the 2-drug ART regimen DTG + 3TC in treatment-naive patients with HIV.

The favorable efficacy and safety of the 2-drug regimen DTG + 3TC in treatment-naive patients with HIV-1 have been demonstrated in two single-arm, pilot studies. Furthermore, two large, multicenter, Phase III, RCTs – GEMINI-1 and GEMINI-2 – demonstrated the noninferiority of DTG + 3TC relative to DTG + TDF/FTC with regard to virologic efficacy, with a similar safety profile. However, conducting RCTs to directly compare 2-drug and 3-drug regimens in patients with HIV-1 infection is costly and time-consuming. Using robust methods such as NMA is therefore appropriate to compare the relative efficacy and safety of different regimens by indirect means, particularly in an evolving treatment landscape. Indeed, NMAs are used increasingly to support health technology assessment submissions and the development of treatment guidelines and are useful in informing prescribing choices in the clinical environment. For example, a 2016 systematic review and NMA evaluating ART regimens in treatment-naive patients with HIV-1 determined that the efficacy and safety of ART had improved substantially with the introduction of newer drug classes, specifically INSTIs and more specifically the INSTI DTG. This NMA was used to inform WHO consolidated guidelines on the use of ART for the treatment and prevention of HIV infection. Since then, new data have become available that have led to further changes in the guidelines, such as the US DHHS and EACS recommending the 2-drug regimen of DTG + 3TC as an alternative first-line treatment for treatment-naive adults with HIV. In the absence of head-to-head trials comparing the 2-drug ART regimen DTG + 3TC with traditional 3-drug regimens, the current NMA provides valuable information on the comparative efficacy of these regimens in treatment-naive patients with HIV-1.

Dolutegravir/lamivudine clinical trial evidence — In GEMINI‑1 and GEMINI‑2, 1,433 antiretroviral therapy–naive participants with baseline HIV RNA < 500,000 copies/mL and no evidence of HBV infection were randomized to DTG plus 3TC or DTG plus TDF/FTC. At Week 96, DTG plus 3TC was non‑inferior to DTG plus TDF/FTC with viral loads < 50 copies/mL in 86% versus 89.5%, and virologic nonresponse occurred in 3.1% versus 2%; no instances of treatment‑emergent NRTI or integrase strand transfer inhibitor resistance occurred. Among those starting with CD4 counts < 200 cells/mm3, the Week 96 proportion with HIV RNA < 50 copies/mL was lower with DTG plus 3TC than with DTG plus TDF/FTC, without a higher rate of virologic failures in the two‑drug group. At Week 144, noninferiority was maintained with 82% versus 84% maintaining viral load < 50 copies/mL; the proportion with viral load ≥ 50 copies/mL was similar between groups at 3%. Drug‑related adverse events were lower with DTG plus 3TC (19.6% vs. 25.0%; relative risk ratio, 0.78; 95% confidence interval, 0.64–0.95).

Efficacy

At Week 24, 102 of 131 [78% (95% CI, 70–85%)] participants achieved HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies/ml (ITT-E missing = failure analysis; Table 2); this includes five participants who had the initial DTG/3TC regimen modified before Week 24. Of the remaining 29 participants, nine (7%) had HIV-1 RNA at least 50 copies/ml at Week 24, 15 (11%) discontinued from study, and five (4%) missed the HIV-1 RNA assessment while on study (three due to the COVID-19 pandemic). Among participants with available HIV-1 RNA data under any ART at Week 24 (n = 111), 102 (92%) had HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies/ml, and 109 (98%) had HIV-1 RNA less than 200 copies/ml (observed analysis; Table 2). Ninety-seven of 131 [74% (95% CI, 66–81%)] participants achieved HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies/ml and were still on DTG/3TC at Week 24 (FDA Snapshot analysis; Table 2). Two participants met confirmed virologic failure criteria (virologic rebound) at Week 24, with both remaining on DTG/3TC at the discretion of the investigator until results of subsequent HIV-1 resistance testing became available. No treatment-emergent HIV resistance-associated mutations were detected. Of the nine evaluable participants with HIV-1 RNA at least 50 copies/ml at Week 24, all had baseline HIV-1 RNA more than 100 000 copies/ml (four of whom had baseline HIV-1 RNA > 500 000 copies/ml). Seven of these nine participants had HIV-1 RNA less than 200 copies/ml in the Week 24 window, and the other two had HIV-1 RNA 302 and 247 copies/ml at Week 24; these two participants met confirmed virologic failure criteria, and their baseline viral loads were 13 987 640 and 159 214 copies/ml, respectively. All nine participants had a decline at least 2.8 log 10 copies/ml from baseline HIV-1 RNA values (see Supplemental Digital Content 2, table showing viral load during study for participants with HIV-1 RNA ≥ 50 copies/ml at Week 24).

### Three-year durable efficacy of dolutegravir plus lamivudine in antiretroviral therapy-naive adults with HIV-1 infection [^85ae79e0]. AIDS (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

As people with HIV (PWH) require lifelong therapy, effective treatments with limited toxicity are needed. Two-drug regimens (2DRs) reduce the number of antiretroviral drugs PWH are exposed to and can potentially decrease treatment-associated toxicity and costs. To ensure comparable efficacy with three-drug regimens (3DRs), the optimal antiretroviral agents in a 2DR should have potent and durable antiviral activity and a high barrier to resistance.

Dolutegravir (DTG) is a potent integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) with a high barrier to resistance, supporting its inclusion in a 2DR, especially with the well tolerated nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) lamivudine (3TC). In the week 48, primary analyses of the phase III GEMINI-1 and GEMINI-2 studies in treatment-naive adults, the 2DR DTG + 3TC was noninferior to the 3DR DTG + tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) in achieving HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/ml. The subsequent week 96 analysis demonstrated the durable efficacy of DTG + 3TC, as evidenced by its sustained noninferiority vs. DTG + TDF/FTC. Few participants met confirmed virologic withdrawal (CVW) criteria, and no treatment-emergent resistance mutations were detected. As a result, the DTG/3TC single-tablet, fixed-dose combination 2DR was approved by the European Medicines Agency and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2019. Additionally, the US Department of Health and Human Services, European AIDS Clinical Society, and International Antiviral Society–USA 2020 guidelines classify DTG + 3TC as a recommended initial antiretroviral regimen for most PWH, with exceptions for individuals with HIV-1 RNA > 500 000 copies/ml, hepatitis B virus (HBV) co-infection, or in whom therapy is started before the results of HIV genotypic resistance testing for reverse transcriptase or HBV testing are available.

As 2DRs are an emerging and important treatment option for PWH, it is critical to assess their long-term durability and genetic barrier to resistance. Here, we present efficacy and safety data from the prespecified 144-week secondary analyses of the GEMINI studies.

### ACTG A5353: a pilot study of dolutegravir plus lamivudine for initial treatment of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1)-infected participants with HIV-1 RNA [^555db94b]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Limited data exist on initial human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) treatment with dolutegravir plus lamivudine.

Methods

A5353 is a phase 2, single-arm, pilot study of once-daily dolutegravir (50 mg) plus lamivudine (300 mg) in treatment-naive participants with HIV-1 RNA ≥ 1000 and < 500000 copies/mL. Exclusion criteria included active hepatitis B or major protease, reverse transcriptase, or integrase resistance. The primary efficacy measure was the proportion with HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL (FDA [US Food and Drug Administration] Snapshot) at week 24. Virologic failure (VF) was confirmed HIV-1 RNA > 400 copies/mL at week 16/20 or > 200 copies/mL at or after week 24. Dolutegravir levels and drug resistance testing were performed at VF.

Results

One hundred and twenty participants (87% male, median age 30 years, 37 (31%) HIV-1 RNA > 100000 copies/mL) initiated study treatment. Median entry HIV-1 RNA and CD4 count were 4.61 log10 copies/mL and 387 cells/mm3. Virologic efficacy at week 24 was 108/120 (90%, confidence interval [83%, 95%]), with comparable results in the > 100000 copies/mL and ≤ 100000 copies/mL strata, that is, 89% (75%, 97%) and 90% (82%, 96%), respectively. Three participants with VF, had undetected plasma dolutegravir at ≥ 1 time points; the M184V and R263R/K mutations developed in 1 participant. Two participants experienced grade 3 possible/probable treatment-related adverse events; none discontinued treatment due to adverse events.

Conclusions

Dolutegravir plus lamivudine demonstrated efficacy in individuals with pretreatment HIV-1 RNA up to 500000 copies/mL in this pilot trial, but a participant developed resistance mutations.

### Comparative efficacy and safety and dolutegravir and lamivudine in treatment naive HIV patients [^bddd5622]. AIDS (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Compare the efficacy and safety of the 2-drug antiretroviral therapy regimen dolutegravir+lamivudine (DTG+3TC) with traditional 3-drug regimens in treatment-naive patients with HIV-1.

Design

Data from double-blind, randomized controlled trials of at least 48 weeks' duration in treatment-naive patients with HIV-1 identified by systematic review were evaluated using a Bayesian network meta-analysis methodology.

Methods

The primary outcome was virologic suppression at Week 48 for 3-drug regimens versus DTG+3TC (also analyzed in patient subgroup with baseline viral load > 100000 RNA copies/ml). Secondary outcomes included CD4 cell count change from baseline and safety (adverse events, serious adverse events, and drug-related adverse events) at Week 48.

Results

The network contains 14 unique regimens from 14 randomized controlled trials based on data from 10043 patients. The proportional difference for viral suppression at 48 weeks for DTG+3TC versus the other 13 regimens included in the network ranged from -2.7% (-11.0, 5.6%) versus DTG+tenofovir alafenamide/emtricitabine (FTC) to 7.3% (0.6, 13.8%) versus efavirenz+tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/FTC. DTG+3TC was found to be significantly better than efavirenz+tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/FTC and similar to all other regimens analysed in terms of viral suppression at 48 weeks. With regard to other outcomes (CD4, adverse event, serious adverse event, drug-related adverse events) at 48 weeks, DTG+3TC was broadly similar to all regimens analysed.

Conclusion

This network meta-analysis demonstrates similar efficacy and safety outcomes over 48 weeks with DTG+3TC compared with traditional 3-drug antiretroviral therapy regimens.

### 'With age comes wisdom': effectiveness and tolerability of dolutegravir + lamivudine in virologically-suppressed people with HIV [^f355283f]. AIDS (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

HIV-1 infection continues to pose a significant global health challenge, prompting ongoing advancements in therapeutic strategies. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has emerged as an indispensable tool in the management of the HIV pandemic, substantially improving patient outcomes and enhancing overall quality of life. Traditionally, combination regimens involving three or more drugs have been the primary approach to treatment. However, recent developments mark a notable shift in perspective, with a growing emphasis on two-drug regimens (2DRs) as effective alternatives.

The TANGO study, conducted among people with HIV (PWH) who have experienced previous treatment, stands out as a pivotal investigation. This study demonstrated that switching to a dual therapy comprising lamivudine (3TC) and dolutegravir (DTG), in contrast to continuing a triple therapy regimen based on tenofovir alafenamide (TAF), was noninferior in terms of virological efficacy. Notably, this switch did not result in any treatment interruptions related to virological failures after 144 weeks of follow-up. These findings hold significant implications, especially considering the evolving landscape of HIV management.

In response to such compelling evidence, contemporary treatment guidelines have incorporated 2DRs, like 3TC/DTG, as first-line therapies for both treatment-naive individuals and those needing therapeutic simplification. The strategic move towards 2DRs reflects not only their comparable effectiveness but also the potential for reduced drug-related toxicities and improved adherence. This paradigm shift aligns with the broader goal of optimizing HIV care by tailoring treatment approaches to individual needs.

This study aims to evaluate the viroimmunological effectiveness and durability of 3TC/DTG in a cohort of PWH under our outpatient clinic's care, with an extensive 8-year follow-up period.

Analysis of virologic outcomes showed a similar proportion of participants with HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/ml (Snapshot) in either treatment group at each visit through week 144 (Fig. 1 a). In the pooled ITT-E analysis, 82% of participants in the DTG + 3TC group and 84% in the DTG + TDF/FTC group achieved HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/ml (adjusted treatment difference [95% CI], −1.8% [−5.8, 2.1]; Fig. 1 b). Using a 10% noninferiority margin, DTG + 3TC remained noninferior to DTG + TDF/FTC at week 144. Non-inferiority was also supported by the pooled per-protocol sensitivity analysis, as 83% (575/689) of participants in the DTG + 3TC group and 85% (584/685) in the DTG + TDF/FTC group achieved HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/ml (adjusted treatment difference [95% CI], −1.7% [−5.5, 2.1]. In GEMINI-1, 79% of participants in the DTG + 3TC group and 83% in the DTG + TDF/FTC group achieved HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/ml at week 144; the corresponding percentages in GEMINI-2 were 84% vs. 84%; Fig. 1 b). In the pooled analysis, the proportion of participants in the Snapshot HIV-1 RNA ≥ 50 copies/ml category was 3% in both treatment groups (Fig. 1 a). The majority of Snapshot failures that occurred in both treatment groups were due to non-treatment-related reasons (SDC 3, table showing Snapshot outcomes in individual and pooled studies). In the prespecified TRDF analysis at week 144, 5% of participants in each treatment group discontinued for treatment-related reasons (treatment difference [95% CI], 0.6% [−1.7, 2.9]). Adjusted mean change from baseline to week 144 in CD4 + cell count was 301.9 cells/μl in the DTG + 3TC group and 299.9 cells/μl in the DTG + TDF/FTC group.

### Virologic efficacy of tenofovir, lamivudine and dolutegravir as second-line antiretroviral therapy in adults failing a tenofovir-based first-line regimen [^3caa2790]. AIDS (2021). Medium credibility.

Our study has limitations. Firstly, our sample size was small and we had no control arm. We had sufficient precision for our primary outcome, but not for the important secondary outcome, as discussed in DAWNING, of virologic response stratified by level of baseline NRTI resistance mutations. Secondly, as the development of integrase-inhibitor resistance may be delayed and occur 24 to 48 weeks after switching to dolutegravir, we will continue to monitor our participants until 96 weeks. Thirdly, all our participants had supplemental dolutegravir doses for two weeks to overcome efavirenz induction effects, and our findings may not be generalisable to patients not given supplemental doses.

It is unknown whether this supplementary dosing strategy is necessary. Efavirenz induces enzymes and transporters involved in dolutegravir absorption and metabolism, reducing plasma dolutegravir concentrations at the end of the dosing interval up to 75%. A pharmacokinetic sub-study of STRIIVING concluded that no dolutegravir dose adjustment is required when switching from efavirenz to dolutegravir, but this trial was conducted in virologically suppressed individuals in whom efavirenz was likely still active. Because all patients entered our study with elevated VLs and would likely have efavirenz resistance, we elected to include a two-week supplementary dose of dolutegravir (50mg twice daily). This dosing strategy has not been practiced in other second-line trials where small numbers of participants developed integrase-inhibitor resistance or in low-income settings where infrequent cases of dolutegravir resistance have been reported as TLD has been introduced. We will be exploring this strategy in stage two of our study, in which patients will be randomised to supplementary dolutegravir 50mg or placebo for the first two weeks of second-line TLD.

### Efficacy and safety of switching to dolutegravir / lamivudine fixed-dose 2-drug regimen vs continuing a tenofovir alafenamide-based 3-or 4-drug regimen for maintenance of virologic suppression in adults living with human immunodeficiency virus type 1: phase 3, randomized, noninferiority TANGO study [^eee55916]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

The success of 3-drug regimens (3DRs) in people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV; PLWH) has decreased mortality and improved life expectancies near to those of the general population in the majority of treated patients. Consequently, PLWH will likely remain on antiviral therapy (ART) for decades. Although current regimens tend to have fewer toxicities than older regimens, concerns remain over the cumulative effects of long-term ART. Two-drug regimens (2DRs) have been investigated as a means for reducing the number of antiretroviral agents (ARVs) taken by individuals who need lifelong ART.

Currently, there are two 2DRs that have received marketing authorization for treatment of individuals living with HIV-1. Dolutegravir (DTG) in combination with rilpivirine (RPV) is indicated as a complete regimen for virologically suppressed adults based on results from the SWORD-1 and SWORD-2 trials. The fixed-dose combination (FDC) of DTG/lamivudine (3TC) is indicated for treatment-naive and treatment-experienced adults with no known or suspected resistance to the individual components. This is based on results from the identically designed, phase 3 GEMINI-1 and GEMINI-2 trials, which demonstrated noninferiority of DTG + 3TC vs DTG + tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) in treatment-naive PLWH.

Dolutegravir is a strong candidate for inclusion in 2DRs because of its high potency and barrier to resistance. In the GEMINI trials, DTG + 3TC and DTG + TDF/FTC showed similar rapid declines in plasma viral load, regardless of baseline viral load, and no resistance was reported for up to 96 weeks. The efficacy and safety of switching to DTG + 3TC in adults suppressed on 3DRs have been demonstrated in smaller studies. Here, we present the week 48 primary end-point analysis of the phase 3 TANGO study in which the efficacy and safety of a switch to DTG/3TC FDC in adults living with HIV-1 with virologic suppression on a 3- or 4-drug tenofovir alafenamide (TAF)–based regimen was evaluated.

### Efficacy and safety of switching to dolutegravir / lamivudine versus continuing a tenofovir alafenamide-based 3-or 4-drug regimen for maintenance of virologic suppression in adults living with human immunodeficiency virus type 1: results through week 144 from the phase 3, noninferiority TANGO randomized trial [^2762323c]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Week 144 results of the TANGO study demonstrate long-term, durable virologic efficacy after switching to the 2-drug regimen DTG/3TC, as evidenced by its sustained noninferiority (ITT-E) in maintaining virologic suppression, compared with continuing 3- or 4-drug TAF-based regimens. The supportive analysis in the per-protocol population favored DTG/3TC at weeks 96 and 144. Importantly, the rate of Snapshot virologic failure at week 144 remained < 1% in the DTG/3TC group (ITT-E). Virologic suppression rates were high and sustained and were similar between treatment groups across subgroups. Differences in small subgroups should be interpreted with caution, especially where Snapshot failures were driven by nonvirologic causes. This demonstrates the efficacy of DTG/3TC regardless of baseline treatment, participant, or disease characteristics. No participants who switched to DTG/3TC met CVW criteria, and no resistance development was reported in either treatment group through week 144. The overall rates of AEs were similar between groups, and after week 48, the rates of AEs, SAEs, drug-related AEs, and AEs leading to study discontinuation were similar between groups.

Few participants had HIV-1 RNA levels ≥ 50 copies/mL in the present study, consistent with results from the SALSA study, in which DTG/3TC demonstrated efficacy noninferior to that of continuing any current antiretroviral regimen for 1 year in treatment-experienced participants. Virologic response rates were also high in the GEMINI-1 and GEMINI-2 studies, in which DTG + 3TC demonstrated durable efficacy for 3 years in treatment-naive participants. In addition, the low rate of virologic failure observed through week 144 in TANGO is consistent with findings from a meta-analysis of 6 real-world observational studies, which found that DTG/3TC as maintenance therapy resulted in virologic failure (defined as 2 consecutive viral load measurements ≥ 50 copies/mL and/or 1 measurement > 1000 copies/mL) in 1% of treatment-experienced patients (n = 2033) at either week 48 or week 96.

METHODS

Study Design

TANGO (ClinicalTrials.gov; NCT03446573) is an ongoing, phase 3, randomized, open-label, noninferiority study of the efficacy and safety of switching to DTG/3TC versus continuing TAF-based regimens in virologically suppressed adults with HIV-1. Before the first participant reached the 48-week visit, the protocol was amended to extend the randomized phase through week 148, with additional predefined secondary end points at weeks 96 and 144. Methods have been published elsewhere and are briefly described below (Supplementary Methods). Adults with virologic suppression (HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL) on a first-line TAF-based regimen for > 6 months were eligible. Switching from tenofovir disoproxil fumarate to TAF ≥ 3 months before study entry was allowed, as well as switching pharmacokinetic enhancers ritonavir and cobicistat. Participants were ineligible if they had evidence of major nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor or any integrase strand transfer inhibitor resistance–associated mutations in historical genotypic results, as provided by investigators (any locally validated commercial or noncommercial assay, including sites' local laboratory home-brewed assays, were considered); any plasma HIV-1 RNA measurement ≥ 50 copies/mL within 6 months of screening; ≥ 2 measurements ≥ 50 copies/mL or any measurement > 200 copies/mL within 6 and 12 months of screening; or a prior regimen switch for virologic failure (HIV-1 RNA ≥ 400 copies/mL).

Procedures

After a ≤ 28-day screening period, eligible participants were randomized 1:1 to switch to a once-daily DTG (50 mg)/3TC (300 mg) fixed-dose combination or continue their TAF-based regimen. Randomization was stratified by baseline third agent class. No regimen modifications were allowed, except switching between ritonavir and cobicistat. Study visits were planned at baseline; at weeks 4, 8, and 12; and every 12 weeks thereafter until week 144. Plasma for HIV-1 RNA quantification was collected at each visit and at study withdrawal and analyzed using the Abbott RealTime HIV-1 assay (lower detection limit, 40 copies/mL). For measurements of plasma HIV-1 RNA < 40 copies/mL, qualitatively observable results were denoted as "target detected", and measurements not qualitatively observable as "target not detected". Safety outcomes were assessed at each study visit through the last participant's week 144 data cutoff (Supplementary Methods).

### Efficacy and safety of switching to dolutegravir / lamivudine versus continuing a tenofovir alafenamide-based 3-or 4-drug regimen for maintenance of virologic suppression in adults living with human immunodeficiency virus type 1: results through week 144 from the phase 3, noninferiority TANGO randomized trial [^155b7189]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Because individuals with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) require lifelong therapy, a need for effective treatments with limited long-term toxicity remains. Two-drug regimens reduce the number of antiretroviral agents in a regimen and may reduce treatment-associated toxicity, drug-drug interactions, and costs.

International guidelines, including the 2020 International Antiretroviral Society–USA, 2021 Department of Health and Human Services, and 2021 European AIDS Clinical Society guidelines, recommend the 2-drug regimen dolutegravir/lamivudine (DTG/3TC) as an initial treatment regimen based on results from phase 3 GEMINI-1/GEMINI-2 studies. DTG/3TC is also recommended in switch settings, supported by 48-week results from the phase 3 SALSA and TANGO studies. In SALSA, the proportion of participants with HIV type 1 (HIV-1) RNA levels ≥ 50 copies/mL (primary end point, US Food and Drug Administration [FDA] Snapshot algorithm) switching to single-tablet fixed-dose combination DTG/3TC was noninferior to continuing the current antiretroviral regimen in virologically suppressed individuals. In TANGO, switching to DTG/3TC was noninferior to continuing tenofovir alafenamide (TAF)–based 3- or 4-drug regimens, with < 1% of participants in both groups having HIV-1 RNA levels ≥ 50 copies/mL at week 48. In both groups, 93% of participants had HIV-1 RNA levels < 50 copies/mL (Snapshot), with no confirmed virologic withdrawals (CVWs) observed in the DTG/3TC group. Safety profiles were comparable between groups, with lipid profile generally favoring DTG/3TC. Here we report longer-term results from the planned secondary 96-week and 144-week analyses of TANGO.

Abbreviation: HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus type 1.

The proportions of participants with Snapshot HIV-1 RNA levels < 50 copies/mL were 86% (317 of 369) in the DTG/3TC and 82% (304 of 372) in the TAF-based regimen group (ITT-E population; adjusted treatment difference, 4.2 [95% CI, −1.1 to 9.5]) at week 144. Results from the efficacy evaluable population at weeks 96 and 144 were consistent with the main ITT-E analyses. The proportions of participants with "target not detected" status at week 144 were 76% (279 of 369) in the DTG/3TC group and 72% (267 of 372) in the TAF-based regimen group (ITT-E population; adjusted treatment difference, 3.9 [95% CI, −2.5 to 10.2]) (Supplementary Table 1). The proportions of participants with HIV-1 RNA levels < 50 copies/mL (Snapshot; ITT-E) across subgroups at week 144 were generally consistent with overall results (Figure 3).

### Efficacy and safety of switching to dolutegravir / lamivudine versus continuing a tenofovir alafenamide-based 3-or 4-drug regimen for maintenance of virologic suppression in adults living with human immunodeficiency virus type 1: results through week 144 from the phase 3, noninferiority TANGO randomized trial [^15f66edf]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Through week 144, the rate of drug-related AEs was higher with DTG/3TC than with TAF-based regimens, which is expected in a switch study setting where participants were stable on their preexisting regimens. In TANGO, 90% of participants were switched to 2 new drugs in the DTG/3TC group at baseline. However, in the post–week 48 AE analysis, rates of drug-related AEs and AEs leading to discontinuation were low and similar in both groups, and rates of AEs and SAEs were comparable between groups, supporting the transient impact of adjusting to new treatment regimens. From baseline to week 144, weight gains were comparable between groups. Of note, weight loss in participants with BMI categorized as obese at baseline in the TAF-based regimen group was observed between weeks 48 and 96 with weight regained by week 144; in the DTG/3TC group, a smaller weight loss was observed from day 1, with weight regained by week 48. The dynamic of weight changes over time may be related to the impact of external lifestyle interventions, as evidenced by the post hoc analysis of dietetic counseling/weight management program referrals. The numbers of participants withdrawing because of an AE of increased weight (2 of 369 receiving DTG/3TC and 1 of 371 receiving TAF-based regimens) and the proportions with ≥ 10% weight increase from baseline (13% and 12% for DTG/3TC and TAF-based regimens, respectively) were similar between groups.

### Dolutegravir or darunavir in combination with zidovudine or tenofovir to treat HIV [^213eaac7]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2021). Excellent credibility.

Background

The World Health Organization recommends dolutegravir with two nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) for second-line treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. Evidence is limited for the efficacy of this regimen when NRTIs are predicted to lack activity because of drug resistance, as well as for the recommended switch of an NRTI from tenofovir to zidovudine.

Methods

In a two-by-two factorial, open-label, noninferiority trial, we randomly assigned patients for whom first-line therapy was failing (HIV-1 viral load, ≥ 1000 copies per milliliter) to receive dolutegravir or ritonavir-boosted darunavir and to receive tenofovir or zidovudine; all patients received lamivudine. The primary outcome was a week 48 viral load of less than 400 copies per milliliter, assessed with the Food and Drug Administration snapshot algorithm (noninferiority margin for the between-group difference in the percentage of patients with the primary outcome, 12 percentage points).

Results

We enrolled 464 patients at seven sub-Saharan African sites. A week 48 viral load of less than 400 copies per milliliter was observed in 90.2% of the patients in the dolutegravir group (212 of 235) and in 91.7% of those in the darunavir group (210 of 229) (difference, -1.5 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI] -6.7 to 3.7; P = 0.58; indicating noninferiority of dolutegravir, without superiority) and in 92.3% of the patients in the tenofovir group (215 of 233) and in 89.6% of those in the zidovudine group (207 of 231) (difference, 2.7 percentage points; 95% CI, -2.6 to 7.9; P = 0.32; indicating noninferiority of tenofovir, without superiority). In the subgroup of patients with no NRTIs that were predicted to have activity, a viral load of less than 400 copies per milliliter was observed in more than 90% of the patients in the dolutegravir group and the darunavir group. The incidence of adverse events did not differ substantially between the groups in either factorial comparison.

Conclusions

Dolutegravir in combination with NRTIs was effective in treating patients with HIV-1 infection, including those with extensive NRTI resistance in whom no NRTIs were predicted to have activity. Tenofovir was noninferior to zidovudine as second-line therapy. (Funded by Janssen; NADIA ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03988452.).

### Efficacy and tolerability of dolutegravir / lamivudine versus dolutegravir / rilpivirine in switching from a three-drug regimen based on nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors: a retrospective cohort study [^c4e5c31d]. Journal of Medical Virology (2023). Medium credibility.

Real-life comparisons of dolutegravir/rilpivirine (DTG/RPV) and DTG/lamivudine (3TC) regimens in people living with human immunodeficiency virus (PLWHIV) who switched from a standard three-drug regimen based on nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) are missing. This study aimed to compare DTG/3TC and DTG/RPV in virologically suppressed patients (HIV-RNA < 50copies/mL) coming from any NNRTI-based regimen in terms of discontinuation due to virologic failure (VF) discontinuation rates due to all causes, and adverse events. As a secondary outcome, we evaluated the difference in creatinine, total cholesterol, CD4, and triglycerides from baseline to weeks 48 after the switch. Of the 415 PLWHs included in the study, 278 (66.9%) switched to DTG/3TC, and 137 (33.1%) switched to DTG/RPV. Overall, 48 PLWHs (11.6%) discontinued the treatment:38 with DTG/3TC and 10 with DTG/RPV with similar discontinuation rates: 5.01×100py (95% confidence interval [CI] 3.64–6.94) and 4.66×100py (95% CI 2.51–8.67), respectively. The most common reason for discontinuation was toxicity (26 patients, 22/278 [7.9%] in the DTG/3TC group and 4/137 [2.9%] in the DTG/RPV group), mainly neurologic toxicity (never above grade 2). We found no differences in discontinuation rates due to treatment adverse events. Two study participants experienced virological failure in the DTG/3TC arm. We observed no significant difference in CD4 cell counts, lipid parameters, or renal function between the two groups at 48 weeks. This study demonstrated that, in clinical practice, a two-drug regimen with DTG/3TC or DTG/RPV is characterized by a low discontinuation rate and VF in virologically suppressed PLWHs switched from an NNRTI-based three antiretroviral drugs regimen.

WARNING: HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS, AND EXACERBATIONS OF HEPATITIS B

Hypersensitivity Reactions

Serious and sometimes fatal hypersensitivity reactions, with multiple organ involvement, have occurred with abacavir, a component of TRIUMEQ and TRIUMEQ PD (abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine). Patients who carry the HLA ‑ B*5701 allele are at a higher risk of a hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir, although hypersensitivity reactions have occurred in patients who do not carry the HLA ‑ B*5701 allele [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

TRIUMEQ and TRIUMEQ PD are contraindicated in patients with a prior hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir and in HLA ‑ B*5701-positive patients [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. All patients should be screened for the HLA ‑ B*5701 allele prior to initiating therapy with TRIUMEQ or TRIUMEQ PD or reinitiation of therapy with TRIUMEQ or TRIUMEQ PD, unless patients have a previously documented HLA ‑ B*5701 allele assessment. Discontinue TRIUMEQ or TRIUMEQ PD immediately if a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, regardless of HLA ‑ B*5701 status and even when other diagnoses are possible [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

### Once-daily dolutegravir versus raltegravir in antiretroviral-naive adults with HIV-1 infection: 48 week results from the randomised, double-blind, non-inferiority SPRING-2 study [^9a08c1da]. Lancet (2013). Excellent credibility.

Background

Dolutegravir (S/GSK1349572) is a once-daily HIV integrase inhibitor with potent antiviral activity and a favourable safety profile. We compared dolutegravir with HIV integrase inhibitor raltegravir, as initial treatment for adults with HIV-1.

Methods

SPRING-2 is a 96 week, phase 3, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, non-inferiority study that began on Oct 19, 2010, at 100 sites in Canada, USA, Australia, and Europe. Treatment-naive adults (aged ≥ 18 years) with HIV-1 infection and HIV-1 RNA concentrations of 1000 copies per mL or greater were randomly assigned (1:1) via a computer-generated randomisation sequence to receive either dolutegravir (50 mg once daily) or raltegravir (400 mg twice daily). Study drugs were given with coformulated tenofovir/emtricitabine or abacavir/lamivudine. Randomisation was stratified by screening HIV-1 RNA (≤ 100,000 copies per mL or > 100,000 copies per mL) and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor backbone. Investigators were not masked to HIV-1 RNA results before randomisation. The primary endpoint was the proportion of participants with HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies per mL at 48 weeks, with a 10% non-inferiority margin. Main secondary endpoints were changes from baseline in CD4 cell counts, incidence and severity of adverse events, changes in laboratory parameters, and genotypic or phenotypic evidence of resistance. Our primary analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01227824.

Findings

411 patients were randomly allocated to receive dolutegravir and 411 to receive raltegravir and received at least one dose of study drug. At 48 weeks, 361 (88%) patients in the dolutegravir group achieved an HIV-1 RNA value of less than 50 copies per mL compared with 351 (85%) in the raltegravir group (adjusted difference 2·5%; 95% CI -2·2 to 7·1). Adverse events were similar between treatment groups. The most common events were nausea (59 [14%] patients in the dolutegravir group vs 53 [13%] in the raltegravir group), headache (51 [12%] vs 48 [12%]), nasopharyngitis (46 [11%] vs 48 [12%]), and diarrhoea (47 [11%] in each group). Few patients had drug-related serious adverse events (three [< 1%] vs five [1%]), and few had adverse events leading to discontinuation (ten [2%] vs seven [2%] in each group). CD4 cell counts increased from baseline to week 48 in both treatment groups by a median of 230 cells per μL. Rates of graded laboratory toxic effects were similar. We noted no evidence of treatment-emergent resistance in patients with virological failure on dolutegravir, whereas of the patients with virologic failure who received raltegravir, one (6%) had integrase treatment-emergent resistance and four (21%) had nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors treatment-emergent resistance.

Interpretation

The non-inferior efficacy and similar safety profile of dolutegravir compared with raltegravir means that if approved, combination treatment with once-daily dolutegravir and fixed-dose nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors would be an effective new option for treatment of HIV-1 in treatment-naive patients.

### Efficacy and safety of switching to dolutegravir / lamivudine fixed-dose 2-drug regimen vs continuing a tenofovir alafenamide-based 3-or 4-drug regimen for maintenance of virologic suppression in adults living with human immunodeficiency virus type 1: phase 3, randomized, noninferiority TANGO study [^c3122221]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, the primary results from this large, randomized, phase 3, multicenter study demonstrate that switching to DTG/3TC FDC was noninferior to remaining on a TAF-based regimen through week 48 in virologically suppressed adults with no prior history of virologic failure or known major resistance mutations to NRTIs or INSTIs. These findings support the use of DTG/3TC as a switch option for PLWH with viral suppression on a 3- or 4-drug regimen who wish to receive fewer ARTs, including due to treatment complexity, avoidance of potential drug-associated toxicity, risk of drug–drug interactions, or cost. On the basis of the results from the GEMINI and TANGO studies, the 2DR of DTG/3TC FDC is now a recommended preferred regimen in the US Department of Health and Human Services and European AIDS Clinical Society guidelines for ART-naive and ART-experienced virologically suppressed PLWH.

Abbreviations: CAR, current antiretroviral regimen; CI, confidence interval; DTG/3TC, dolutegravir/lamivudine; FDA, Food and Drug Administration; HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus 1; INSTI, integrase strand transfer inhibitor; ITT-E, intention-to-treat–exposed; NNRTI, nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor; PI, protease inhibitor.

The median (interquartile range [IQR]) change from baseline to week 48 in CD4+ cell count was 30.0 cells/mm 3 (−83.0, 115.5) in the DTG/3TC group and 2.0 cells/mm 3 (−105.0, 94.0) in the CAR group. The median (IQR) change from baseline to week 48 in CD4+/CD8+ cell count ratio was 0.04 (−0.06, 0.13) in the DTG/3TC group and 0.05 (−0.06, 0.13) in the CAR group.

Zero participants in either treatment group met CVW criteria; as such, no resistance testing was performed.

### Challenges for novel antiretroviral development in an era of widespread tenofovir-disoproxil / lamivudine (or emtricitabine) / dolutegravir availability (TLD) availability [^7dfba797]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

More than 80% of people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) take first-line tenofovir-disoproxil/lamivudine (or emtricitabine)/dolutegravir (TLD). Due to hard-fought activism, TLD now costs < $45 per person per year in more than 100 LMICs under Voluntary License. With final dolutegravir (DTG) patents expiring by 2029, generic TLD will soon be available globally. Here, we identify seven critical benchmarks that underpin TLDs' success which novel antiretroviral therapy (ART) should now meet, and an eighth benchmark for which novel ART should aim. These benchmarks are superior efficacy; high genetic barrier to resistance; safety in hepatitis B coinfection; favourable drug interaction profiles; HIV2 efficacy; safety in pregnancy, long-acting formulation availability and affordable pricing. We compare the generic TLD availability timeline with development timelines for two case-study novel ART combinations: islatravir/doravirine and cabotegravir/rilpivirine. We demonstrate that currently these regimens and trial programs will not meet key benchmarks required to compete with TLD.

Table 3
Participants who switched from dolutegravir/lamivudine before the Week 24 HIV-1 RNA assessment.

Median time to suppression was 35 days (95% CI, 30–55). At Week 24, median change from baseline in CD4 + cell count and CD4 + /CD8 + cell count ratio under DTG/3TC treatment was 170 cells/μl [interquartile range (IQR), 90–255] and 0.26 (IQR, 0.12–0.42), respectively.

According to the ITT-E missing = failure analysis, the proportion of participants achieving HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies/ml was consistent across baseline demographic subgroups including current sex [female, 9/11 (82%); male, 93/120 (78%)], age [< 50 years, 86/111 (77%); ≥ 50 years, 16/20 (80%)], and race [white, 52/65 (80%); non-white, 50/66 (76%)]. Among participants with baseline HIV-1 RNA at least 1000 000 and those with CD4 + cell count less than 200 cells/μl, 8/10 (80%) and 25/37 (68%) achieved HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies/ml at Week 24, respectively. Of the 12 participants with CD4 + cell count less than 200 cells/μl who did not reach HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies/ml at Week 24, seven remained on study with HIV-1 RNA at least 50 copies/ml at Week 24 and five discontinued (three lost to follow-up, one physician decision, one participant decision). Among the 19 participants with baseline HIV-1 RNA at least 500 000 copies/ml, 13 (68%) were suppressed to less than 50 copies/ml at Week 24, four remain on study with HIV-1 RNA at least 50 copies/ml at Week 24 (three achieved HIV-1 RNA < 200 copies/ml), and two discontinued.
