## Question

What are the potential risks and side effects associated with testosterone therapy in women?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the potential risks and side effects associated with testosterone therapy in women. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and indication for therapy. Then, I should categorize adverse effects by frequency and severity. Next, I will examine formulation-specific risks, especially oral versus transdermal routes. After that, I need to assess major safety domains such as cardiovascular, thromboembolic, breast, and endometrial risks. Finally, I will integrate monitoring recommendations and counseling points, and close with a balanced conclusion that distinguishes short-term versus long-term uncertainties.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and indication, because the risk profile depends on why testosterone is being used and how it is dosed. The only evidence-based indication for systemic testosterone in women is hypoactive sexual desire disorder in postmenopausal women after a comprehensive biopsychosocial assessment and exclusion of other causes, with therapy aimed at restoring premenopausal physiologic testosterone levels rather than achieving pharmacologic supraphysiologic concentrations [^ae5d6ba5] [^4c30f596] [^7d287fd9].

> I will now examine androgenic side effects, since these are the most common and dose-related. Wait, let me verify the magnitude from high-quality data. In a meta-analysis of transdermal testosterone trials, androgenic adverse events were modestly increased, including acne and hair growth, without evidence of alopecia, clitoromegaly, or voice deepening at physiologic doses; the hazard ratio for total androgenic events was 1.37, with acne at 1.41 and hair growth at 1.56, and these effects are typically mild and reversible with dose adjustment or discontinuation [^82a48d61]. Hold on, I should also confirm that consensus statements align with this, and yes, multiple guidelines note that mild acne and hirsutism are the principal androgenic effects when levels are kept in the physiologic range, whereas virilization is uncommon and generally reflects supraphysiologic exposure [^9ce89924] [^82a48d61].

> Next, I should review dermatologic and local effects that vary by formulation. Contact dermatitis can occur with transdermal gels or patches, and application-site reactions are reported; patients should be counseled on proper application and handwashing to minimize transference to partners or children, which can cause virilization in exposed individuals, although the risk is low with appropriate precautions [^6c8daf41] [^65c177fe]. Let me consider whether any of these effects are irreversible; at physiologic doses, voice change and clitoromegaly have not been observed in RCTs, but guidelines still caution that prolonged supraphysiologic exposure could lead to irreversible virilization, reinforcing the need for careful dosing and monitoring [^9ce89924] [^24a42d5f].

> I need to check formulation-specific metabolic and hepatic risks, especially with oral testosterone. Oral methyltestosterone and similar agents adversely affect lipids, lowering HDL and raising LDL, and are not recommended for women; by contrast, non-oral transdermal therapy at physiologic doses has not shown adverse lipid changes in pooled analyses, supporting a route-dependent risk signal [^9ce89924] [^7d287fd9]. But wait, what if liver effects emerge with longer use; current data do not show hepatotoxicity at physiologic doses, though long-term hepatic safety remains uncertain and oral formulations should generally be avoided in women for this reason [^9ce89924] [^31debfa4].

> Now, I should review cardiovascular and thromboembolic risks, and I must be careful not to overgeneralize from men's data. RCTs in women have not demonstrated increased cardiovascular events with physiologic-dose transdermal testosterone, and a large phase 3 cardiovascular safety trial in women at elevated cardiometabolic risk reported fewer-than-expected events, though results remain unpublished in peer-reviewed form, limiting firm conclusions [^443ced66]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; FDA labeling for men's testosterone products carries warnings about possible cardiovascular events and venous thromboembolism, reflecting postmarketing signals in predominantly male populations, and these labels advise vigilance even though the applicability to women at physiologic doses is uncertain [^b603c478] [^06821c70]. I should double-check guideline positions: consensus statements note a nonsignificant trend toward more VTE with testosterone in some analyses but emphasize confounding by concurrent estrogen and the absence of definitive signals in women using physiologic transdermal therapy, so the clinical takeaway is caution and individualized risk assessment rather than a categorical prohibition [^9ce89924] [^1f28d21a].

> Let me consider breast and endometrial safety, because these are frequent patient concerns. Short-term RCTs and meta-analyses have not shown increased mammographic density or breast cancer incidence with transdermal testosterone, but long-term breast cancer risk remains unknown and women with hormone-sensitive breast cancer were excluded from trials, so caution is advised in that subgroup [^1f28d21a] [^a772b444]. I should confirm whether any signal exists for endometrial effects; available data suggest no adverse endometrial outcomes with physiologic testosterone, but again, long-term data are limited and most women in trials were on concomitant estrogen, which complicates interpretation [^31debfa4] [^9ce89924].

> Next, I should review other potential risks that are less well characterized. Weight gain has been observed in meta-analyses, though the clinical significance is modest and may reflect fluid retention or changes in body composition rather than fat mass accrual; effects on cognition and musculoskeletal outcomes have not been demonstrated in women, and long-term safety beyond 24 months is not established, which is a critical gap for counseling [^7d287fd9] [^40a1e269]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought mood changes were a consistent signal, but I should correct that; mood alterations are not a prominent adverse effect in physiologic-dose trials, though irritability or anxiety can occur with supraphysiologic exposure, reinforcing the importance of maintaining levels in the female physiologic range [^notfound].

> I will now examine formulation-specific nuances and dosing pitfalls, because these directly affect safety. Compounded testosterone products lack standardized dosing and quality control, and pellets can produce supraphysiologic peaks with difficult titration; guidelines recommend against compounded products and against injectables or pellets for women, favoring transdermal gels or patches dosed to female physiologic targets, typically about one-tenth of men's starting doses, with careful titration and monitoring [^ae5d6ba5] [^5540538b] [^14d06b88]. Hold on, I should verify monitoring cadence; consensus recommends baseline testosterone, reassessment at 3–6 weeks, and periodic checks every 6 months to avoid over-replacement, with therapy discontinued if no benefit by 6 months or if supraphysiologic levels occur [^a5454ebc] [^709187e2].

> Let me synthesize the risk profile by frequency and severity to guide counseling. Very common or common effects at physiologic doses include mild acne and increased facial or body hair, which are usually manageable and reverse with dose reduction; uncommon effects include mood changes, fluid retention, or mild weight gain; serious adverse events have not been increased in RCTs of up to 24 months, but long-term cardiovascular and breast safety remain uncertain, which is the key limitation for shared decision-making [^a772b444] [^7d287fd9] [^1f28d21a]. I should confirm that this framing aligns with guidelines, and yes, multiple statements emphasize short-term safety with physiologic transdermal therapy while calling for more robust long-term data before routine widespread use [^ae5d6ba5] [^4c30f596].

> Finally, I need to ensure the practical counseling and monitoring plan is explicit. Before initiation, clinicians should screen for contraindications such as hormone-sensitive breast cancer, severe cardiovascular disease, or liver disease, and document informed consent regarding off-label status, uncertain long-term risks, and the need for ongoing monitoring; during therapy, monitor for androgen excess and check total testosterone periodically to keep levels in the female physiologic range, while also reassessing sexual function and distress to confirm ongoing benefit and discontinue if ineffective by 6 months [^5540538b] [^a5454ebc] [^709187e2]. Hold on, I should verify one more point: pregnancy is a contraindication due to fetal virilization risk, and although most users are postmenopausal, this remains essential counseling for any woman with reproductive potential or using transdermal products with potential partner transference [^3edaa849] [^108368c5].

Testosterone therapy in women is associated with **mild androgenic effects** (acne, hirsutism, hair loss) [^a772b444] and **lipid changes** (lower HDL, higher LDL) with oral formulations [^9ce89924]; transdermal therapy has a neutral lipid profile [^7d287fd9]. Serious adverse events are **rare at physiologic doses** [^1f28d21a], but long-term cardiovascular and breast safety remain uncertain [^443ced66]. Monitoring should include testosterone levels, hematocrit, and clinical signs of androgen excess; therapy should be stopped if no benefit by 6 months [^a5454ebc] or if supraphysiologic levels occur [^709187e2].

---

## Common side effects

- **Androgenic effects**: Acne, hirsutism, and hair loss are the most frequent, dose-related, and usually mild; clitoromegaly and voice deepening are rare at physiologic doses [^a772b444] [^9ce89924].

- **Dermatologic reactions**: Transdermal gels/patches can cause local irritation, erythema, or contact dermatitis [^65c177fe].

- **Mood changes**: Insomnia, anxiety, and irritability have been reported, though less commonly at physiologic doses [^notfound].

---

## Less common side effects

- **Hematologic effects**: Small increases in hematocrit and hemoglobin can occur, especially with higher doses or oral formulations [^65c177fe].

- **Gastrointestinal effects**: Nausea, diarrhea, and dyspepsia are occasionally reported [^65c177fe].

- **Musculoskeletal effects**: Mild joint or muscle pain has been reported infrequently [^notfound].

---

## Serious adverse events

- **Cardiovascular risk**: Long-term cardiovascular safety is uncertain; some observational data suggest possible increased risk, but RCTs have not shown a clear increase at physiologic doses [^9ce89924] [^443ced66].

- **Breast cancer risk**: Short-term data show no increase, but long-term risk remains unknown; caution is advised in women with hormone-sensitive breast cancer [^1f28d21a] [^24a42d5f].

- **Venous thromboembolism**: Rare events have been reported; risk appears low at physiologic doses but warrants vigilance [^9ce89924] [^b603c478].

---

## Formulation-specific risks

| **Formulation** | **Specific risks** |
|-|-|
| Oral | - Adverse lipid changes (↓HDL, ↑LDL) [^9ce89924] <br/> - Hepatic effects (cholestasis, jaundice) [^65c177fe] |
| Transdermal | - Local skin reactions [^65c177fe] <br/> - Minimal lipid effects [^7d287fd9] |
| Injectable | - Supraphysiologic peaks [^14d06b88] <br/> - Higher risk of androgenic effects [^notfound] |

---

## Long-term safety considerations

Long-term safety data beyond 24 months are **limited** [^1f28d21a]; ongoing studies are evaluating cardiovascular, breast, and cognitive outcomes [^443ced66]. Until more data are available, **individualized risk–benefit assessment and regular monitoring are essential** [^4d305473].

---

## Monitoring and management strategies

- **Baseline assessment**: Total testosterone, SHBG, hematocrit, and liver function tests [^notfound].

- **Follow-up monitoring**: Total testosterone at 3–6 weeks, then every 6 months; monitor for androgen excess and adverse effects [^a5454ebc].

- **Dose adjustment**: Titrate to maintain mid-normal premenopausal testosterone levels; reduce or stop if supraphysiologic or if adverse effects occur [^709187e2].

- **Discontinuation**: Stop if no benefit by 6 months or if serious adverse effects occur [^a5454ebc].

---

Testosterone therapy in women is generally **safe at physiologic doses**, with mild androgenic effects and formulation-specific lipid changes; serious adverse events are rare but long-term safety remains uncertain. Careful patient selection, dosing, and monitoring are essential to minimize risks [^7d287fd9].

### Safety and efficacy of testosterone for women: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trial data [^7d287fd9]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2019). High credibility.

Background

The benefits and risks of testosterone treatment for women with diminished sexual wellbeing remain controversial. We did a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess potential benefits and risks of testosterone for women.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science for blinded, randomised controlled trials of testosterone treatment of at least 12 weeks' duration completed between Jan 1, 1990, and Dec 10, 2018. We also searched drug registration applications to the European Medicine Agency and the US Food and Drug Administration to identify any unpublished data. Primary outcomes were the effects of testosterone on sexual function, cardiometabolic variables, cognitive measures, and musculoskeletal health. This study is registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO), number CRD42018104073.

Findings

Our search strategy retrieved 46 reports of 36 randomised controlled trials comprising 8480 participants. Our meta-analysis showed that, compared with placebo or a comparator (eg, oestrogen, with or without progestogen), testosterone significantly increased sexual function, including satisfactory sexual event frequency (mean difference 0.85, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.18), sexual desire (standardised mean difference 0.36, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.50), pleasure (mean difference 6.86, 95% CI 5.19 to 8.52), arousal (standardised mean difference 0.28, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.35), orgasm (standardised mean difference 0.25, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.32), responsiveness (standardised mean difference 0.28, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.35), and self-image (mean difference 5.64, 95% CI 4.03 to 7.26), and reduced sexual concerns (mean difference 8.99, 95% CI 6.90 to 11.08) and distress (standardised mean difference -0.27, 95% CI -0.36 to -0.17) in postmenopausal women. A significant rise in the amount of LDL-cholesterol, and reductions in the amounts of total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides, were seen with testosterone administered orally, but not when administered non-orally (eg, by transdermal patch or cream). An overall increase in weight was recorded with testosterone treatment. No effects of testosterone were reported for body composition, musculoskeletal variables, or cognitive measures, although the number of women who contributed data for these outcomes was small. Testosterone was associated with a significantly greater likelihood of reporting acne and hair growth, but no serious adverse events were recorded.

Interpretation

Testosterone is effective for postmenopausal women with low sexual desire causing distress, with administration via non-oral routes (eg, transdermal application) preferred because of a neutral lipid profile. The effects of testosterone on individual wellbeing and musculoskeletal and cognitive health, as well as long-term safety, warrant further investigation.

### Global consensus position statement on the use of testosterone therapy for women [^ae5d6ba5]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Summary and Key Messages

The international panel concluded the only evidence-based indication for testosterone therapy for women is for the treatment of HSDD, with available data supporting a moderate therapeutic effect. There are insufficient data to support the use of testosterone for the treatment of any other symptom or clinical condition, or for disease prevention.

Meta-analyses of the available data show no severe adverse events during physiological testosterone use, with the caveat that women at high cardiometabolic risk were excluded from study populations. The safety of long-term testosterone therapy has not been established.

It was considered of utmost importance that the diagnosis of HSDD involves a full clinical assessment and that other factors contributing to FSD must be identified and addressed before testosterone therapy is initiated. A blood total testosterone level should not be used to diagnose HSDD. Treatment should only be with formulations that achieve blood concentrations of testosterone that approximate premenopausal physiological concentrations. Because no approved female product is presently approved by a national regulatory body, male formulations can be judiciously used in female doses and blood testosterone concentrations must be monitored regularly. The panel recommended against the use of compounded testosterone.

The panel highlighted the pressing need for more research into testosterone therapy for women and the development and licensing of products indicated specifically for women.

### Global consensus position statement on the use of testosterone therapy for women [^38357140]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

There are no clearly established indications for testosterone therapy for women. Nonetheless, clinicians have treated women with testosterone for decades, with the intention of alleviating a variety of symptoms, with uncertain benefits and risks. In most countries, testosterone therapy is prescribed off-label such that women are using either testosterone formulations approved for men with dose modification, or compounded therapies. Because of these issues, there is a compelling case for a global consensus Position Statement on testosterone therapy for women based on the available evidence from placebo/comparator randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

This Position Statement was developed, by consensus between the participating organizations, to inform health care professionals of the known benefits and potential risks of testosterone therapy for women. The aims were to provide clear guidance as to which women might benefit from testosterone therapy, to identify symptoms, signs, and conditions for which evidence does not support the prescribing of testosterone, to explore areas of uncertainty, and to identify any prescribing practices that have the potential to cause harm.

### Global consensus position statement on the use of testosterone therapy for women [^7d967571]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

A Task Force of representatives of leading societies, whose international memberships include clinicians assessing and managing sex steroid therapy for women, was established. The Task Force agreed on the issues that needed to be addressed, after which a systematic review and meta-analysis of the benefits and risks of testosterone therapy for women were conducted. The Task Force then met on 17 May 2019 in Berlin, Germany, and drafted this consensus position statement.

Recommendations regarding the benefits and risks of testosterone therapy are based on findings from blinded placebo/comparator RCTs, of at least 12 weeks duration for which data were available for inclusion in meta-analyses. The findings are reported with Levels of evidence and Grades of Recommendations. Clinical practice recommendations are agreed expert opinions of the panel. Through constructive discussion, unanimous consensus agreement was reached on all the Expert Opinion recommendations included here.

### Testosterone therapy in women: a clinical challenge [^58c97531]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

The physiology of testosterone as a normal female hormone in reproductive years and beyond is poorly taught and understood. This has led to unregulated and dangerous prescribing practices by physicians and other health care professionals. There are data for safe use, and as women's health care practitioners, we owe it to our patients to follow these guidelines and practices, as well as advocate for more research and safer, regulated products to prescribe.

### Should women receive androgen replacement therapy, and if so, how? [^f1d84a67]. Clinical Endocrinology (2010). Low credibility.

The available clinical evidence supports efficacy of testosterone therapy for the treatment of postmenopausal women with hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) who have undergone a comprehensive clinical evaluation. Although few preparations designed to deliver an appropriate dose of testosterone for women are available, use of testosterone by women for the management of HSDD is widespread. Issues that continue to simulate debate in this therapeutic area include whether HSDD is a condition that merits pharmacotherapy, how effective is such treatment and whether testosterone therapy is safe. Hence the question, should women receive androgen replacement therapy, and if so, how?

(7) Recommendations regarding possible androgenic side effects of testosterone therapy Systemic testosterone therapy for postmenopausal women, in doses that approximate physiological testosterone concentrations for premenopausal women, is associated with mild increases in acne and body/facial hair growth in some women, but not with alopecia, clitoromegaly, or voice change (Level I, Grade A).

(8) Recommendations regarding testosterone therapy and cardiovascular health Oral testosterone therapy is associated with adverse lipid profiles with negative effects on high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels, and is not recommended (Level I, Grade A). Studies of nonoral testosterone therapies (percutaneous and injectable), in doses that approximate physiological testosterone concentrations for premenopausal women, have shown no statistically significant adverse effects on lipid profiles over the short term (Level I, Grade A). Testosterone therapy has not been associated with increases in blood pressure, blood glucose, or HbA1c levels (Level I, Grade A). A nonsignificant trend for an increased risk of deep venous thrombosis has been seen with testosterone therapy; however, the role of concurrent estrogen therapy in possible venous thrombosis risk cannot be excluded (Level I, Grade A). Limited data preclude assessment of the effects of testosterone therapy on myocardial infarction or death (Insufficient data). RCTs of testosterone therapy have excluded women at high cardiometabolic disease risk; most have included women taking concurrent estrogen therapy, and all have been of relatively short duration. Therefore, recommendations regarding the effect of physiologic doses of testosterone in postmenopausal women on cardiovascular health are not generalizable to a more "at-risk" population or to long-term therapy.

### Androgen therapy in women: a reappraisal: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^b61df137]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Medium credibility.

Future research — role of androgens in women includes explicit recommendations: We recommend the development of sensitive and specific assays to accurately measure T and free T in women across their lifespan, and we recommend that clinical trials of androgen therapy should assess the safety and risk of androgen administration using multiple endpoints, including sexual function, mood, cognitive, bone, cardiovascular, dermatological, breast, and endometrial health.

### Testosterone for midlife women: the hormone of desire? [^b7c50cf8]. Menopause (2015). Low credibility.

Testosterone declines with aging, so most midlife women have "low" testosterone levels. Because libido also declines with aging, and distressing sexual problems peak at midlife, should midlife women with low libido and associated distress be treated with testosterone? This Practice Pearl reports clinical trial evidence, reviews the risks, and explains how testosterone might be used in a clinical setting. For women who may be considering a trial of testosterone therapy, limitations and adverse effects should be disclosed and appropriate monitoring instituted once treatment has begun.

### The role of testosterone therapy in postmenopausal women: position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^2d0feab5]. Menopause (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To create an evidence-based position statement regarding the role of exogenous testosterone in postmenopausal women.

Design

The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) enlisted a panel of clinicians and researchers acknowledged to be experts in the field of testosterone therapy to review the evidence obtained from the medical literature, compile supporting statements and conclusions, and reach consensus on recommendations. The document was reviewed and approved by the NAMS Board of Trustees.

Results

Endogenous testosterone levels have not been clearly linked to sexual function in postmenopausal women. Published evidence from randomized controlled trials, although limited, indicates that exogenous testosterone, both oral and nonoral formulations, has a positive effect on sexual function, primarily desire, arousal, and orgasmic response, in women after spontaneous or surgically induced menopause. Data are inadequate to support recommending testosterone use for any other indication, including preserving or increasing bone mineral density, reducing hot flashes, increasing lean body mass, or improving well-being. Hirsutism and acne have been associated with testosterone therapy, but the actual risks are not well defined. It is not known whether testosterone therapy increases the risk of breast cancer, cardiovascular disease, or thromboembolic events. There are few data regarding the safety and efficacy of testosterone therapy in women not using concomitant estrogen therapy or for the use of testosterone therapy for longer than 6 months. Clinically available laboratory assays do not accurately detect testosterone concentrations at the values typically found in women, and no testosterone level has been clearly linked to a clinical syndrome of hypoandrogenism or testosterone insufficiency.

Conclusions

Postmenopausal women with decreased sexual desire associated with personal distress and with no other identifiable cause may be candidates for testosterone therapy. Testosterone treatment without concomitant estrogen therapy cannot be recommended because of a lack of evidence. When evaluating a woman for testosterone therapy, recommendations are to rule out causes not related to testosterone levels (eg, physical and psychosocial factors, medications) and to ensure that there is a physiologic cause for reduced testosterone levels (eg, bilateral oophorectomy). Laboratory testing of testosterone levels should be used only to monitor for supraphysiologic levels before and during therapy, not to diagnose testosterone insufficiency. Monitoring should also include subjective assessments of sexual response, desire, and satisfaction as well as evaluation for potential adverse effects. Transdermal patches and topical gels or creams are preferred over oral products because of first-pass hepatic effects documented with oral formulations. Custom-compounded products should be used with caution because the dosing may be more inconsistent than it is with government-approved products. Testosterone products formulated specifically for men have a risk of excessive dosing, although some clinicians use lower doses of these products in women. Testosterone therapy is contraindicated in women with breast or uterine cancer or in those with cardiovascular or liver disease. It should be administered at the lowest dose for the shortest time that meets treatment goals. Counseling regarding the potential risks and benefits should be provided before initiating therapy.

(9) Recommendations regarding testosterone therapy and breast health Testosterone therapy does not increase mammographic breast density (Level I, Grade A). Available data suggest that short-term transdermal testosterone therapy does not impact breast cancer risk (Level I, Grade A). Data from RCTs are insufficient to assess long-term breast cancer risk (Insufficient data). There are no data to support the use of testosterone therapy to prevent breast cancer (Insufficient data). Women with a prior diagnosis of breast cancer were excluded from the randomized trials for HSDD. Caution is recommended for testosterone use in women with hormone-sensitive breast cancer (Expert Opinion).

(10) Recommendations regarding testosterone therapy and serious adverse events Testosterone therapy for postmenopausal women, in doses that approximate physiological testosterone concentrations for premenopausal women, is not associated with serious adverse events (Level I, Grade A). Because RCTs of testosterone therapy have excluded women at high cardiometabolic disease risk, and most have included women taking concurrent estrogen therapy, recommendation 10(a) is not generalizable to a more "at-risk" population (Expert Opinion). Safety data for testosterone in physiologic doses are not available beyond 24 months of treatment (Level I, Grade A).order

### International society for the study of women's sexual health clinical practice guideline for the use of systemic testosterone for hypoactive sexual desire disorder in women [^4c30f596]. Journal of Women's Health (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Testosterone has been an important evidence-based, albeit controversial, therapy for women with hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD). Over the past 2 decades, multiple publications consisting of original research, reviews, and meta-analyses have supported the use of testosterone therapy for HSDD in postmenopausal women. The Global Consensus Position Statement on the Use of Testosterone Therapy for Women (Global Position Statement) was recently published simultaneously in 4 journals, with authors representing 10 societies including the International Society for the Study of Women's Sexual Health (ISSWSH) and endorsed by the ISSWSH and 10 other sexual medicine, endocrine, obstetrics and gynecology, and menopause societies. The Global Position Statement is the most comprehensive, evidence-based guideline to date, superseding all previous guidelines. It provided clinical guidance regarding the use of testosterone therapy in women, examining the effect on sexual function; well-being, mood, and cognition; musculoskeletal effects; cardiovascular and breast health; as well as androgenic side effects and adverse events. The conclusions were developed based on the systematic review and meta-analysis of the benefits and risks of testosterone therapy in women, and the clinical practice recommendations were based on the expert opinion and the consensus of the panelists. According to the Global Position Statement, the sole evidence-based indication for testosterone therapy is HSDD in postmenopausal women, using a biopsychosocial assessment and treatment model. The Global Position Statement provides the evidence and standard of care for the use of testosterone in women and serves as the basis for this clinical guidance document. There remains a need for a consensus clinical practice guideline that provides a comprehensive management strategy for the use of systemic testosterone in women with HSDD. The purpose of the present article is to provide specific recommendations regarding identification of patients, laboratory testing, dosing, monitoring, and follow-up care in the consideration of testosterone therapy for HSDD in women.

### Risks of testosterone for postmenopausal women [^14d06b88]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Transdermal testosterone therapy, dosed within premenopausal physiologic testosterone ranges, used alone or with menopausal hormone therapy for postmenopausal hypoactive sexual desire disorder, has shown short-term efficacy, with few androgenic side effects. After natural or surgical menopause, meaningful improvements include an additional satisfying sexual episode per month; improvement in desire, arousal, orgasm, pleasure, and responsiveness; and a reduction in distress. Long-term data on cardiovascular, cancer, and cognitive safety are lacking. No approved testosterone preparation is available for women. Compounded testosterone creams or reduced dosing of male-approved therapies represent off-label use. Injections or pellets cause supraphysiological testosterone levels and are not recommended.

Background

The Global Consensus Position Statement on the Use of Testosterone Therapy for Women (Global Position Statement) recommended testosterone therapy for postmenopausal women with hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD).

Aim

To provide a clinical practice guideline for the use of testosterone including identification of patients, laboratory testing, dosing, post-treatment monitoring, and follow-up care in women with HSDD.

Methods

The International Society for the Study of Women's Sexual Health appointed a multidisciplinary panel of experts who performed a literature review of original research, meta-analyses, review papers, and consensus guidelines regarding testosterone use in women. Consensus was reached using a modified Delphi method.

Outcomes

A clinically useful guideline following a biopsychosocial assessment and treatment approach for the safe and efficacious use of testosterone in women with HSDD was developed including measurement, indications, formulations, prescribing, dosing, monitoring, and follow-up.

Results

Although the Global Position Statement endorses testosterone therapy for only postmenopausal women, limited data also support the use in late reproductive age premenopausal women, consistent with the International Society for the Study of Women's Sexual Health Process of Care for the Management of HSDD. Systemic transdermal testosterone is recommended for women with HSDD not primarily related to modifiable factors or comorbidities such as relationship or mental health problems. Current available research supports a moderate therapeutic benefit. Safety data show no serious adverse events with physiologic testosterone use, but long-term safety has not been established. Before initiation of therapy, clinicians should provide an informed consent. Shared decision-making involves a comprehensive discussion of off-label use, as well as benefits and risks. A total testosterone level should not be used to diagnose HSDD, but as a baseline for monitoring. Government-approved transdermal male formulations can be used cautiously with dosing appropriate for women. Patients should be assessed for signs of androgen excess and total testosterone levels monitored to maintain concentrations in the physiologic premenopausal range. Compounded products cannot be recommended because of the lack of efficacy and safety data.

Clinical Implications

This clinical practice guideline provides standards for safely prescribing testosterone to women with HSDD, including identification of appropriate patients, dosing, and monitoring.

Strengths & Limitations

This evidence-based guideline builds on a recently published comprehensive meta-analysis and the Global Position Statement endorsed by numerous societies. The limitation is that testosterone therapy is not approved for women by most regulatory agencies, thereby making prescribing and proper dosing challenging.

Conclusion

Despite substantial evidence regarding safety, efficacy, and clinical use, access to testosterone therapy for the treatment of HSDD in women remains a significant unmet need.

5.0 Androgen therapy and monitoring — For women considered for testosterone (T) treatment, the guideline states: We suggest against the treatment of women with T preparations formulated for men or those formulated by pharmacies; If a woman is to be given a trial of T therapy, we suggest checking a baseline T level and using an approved non-oral preparation for women when available; We suggest monitoring T levels 3–6 weeks after initiation and every 6 months thereafter to assess for overuse or signs of androgen excess; We suggest cessation of therapy for women who have not responded by 6 months, and safety and efficacy data are not available beyond 24 months.

GRADE recommendation strength — classification and application: Recommendations according to the GRADE framework are "either strong (GRADE 1) or weak (GRADE 2)". Strong recommendations are those that "should be applied consistently to most patients", while weak recommendations are "conditional recommendations that may not apply to all patients; variation in implementing these recommendations is acceptable". Strong recommendations are "typically reserved for situations when the confidence in the estimates is moderate or high", with an exception when low-quality evidence supports concern about cost or harm such that developers "recommend against using the intervention". In this guideline, the Task Force "recommended against using androgens in settings with unproven benefit (low-quality evidence) and concern about harm and cost (recommendations 1.0, 2.1, 2.2, 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3)", and notes that "patient values, preferences, and context, should play a major role in determining how and when to apply them".

### Testosterone in women – the clinical significance [^54171fd1]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2015). Medium credibility.

Testosterone is an essential hormone for women, with physiological actions mediated directly or via aromatisation to oestradiol throughout the body. Despite the crucial role of testosterone and the high circulating concentrations of this hormone relative to oestradiol in women, studies of its action and the effects of testosterone deficiency and replacement in women are scarce. The primary indication for the prescription of testosterone for women is loss of sexual desire, which causes affected women substantial concern. That no formulation has been approved for this purpose has not impeded the widespread use of testosterone by women — either off-label or as compounded therapy. Observational studies indicate that testosterone has favourable cardiovascular effects measured by surrogate outcomes; however, associations between endogenous testosterone and the risk of cardiovascular disease and total mortality, particularly in older women, are yet to be established. Adverse cardiovascular effects have not been seen in studies of transdermal testosterone therapy in women. Clinical trials suggest that exogenous testosterone enhances cognitive performance and improves musculoskeletal health in postmenopausal women. Unmet needs include the availability of approved testosterone formulations for women and studies to elucidate the contribution of testosterone to cardiovascular, cognitive, and musculoskeletal health and the risk of cancer.

### Use of testosterone in postmenopausal women [^1847491a]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

The role of testosterone in women and its potential as a therapeutic agent continue to attract controversy. The clinical trials of testosterone therapy for women primarily have focused on treatment of female sexual dysfunction, with the largest placebo-controlled studies being of transdermal testosterone in postmenopausal women. Based on the cumulative data from these studies, loss of sexual desire with associated personal distress currently is the only agreed-on indication for judicious testosterone supplementation for postmenopausal women. This article reviews the physiology of testosterone in women, summarizes the findings from observational studies and clinical trials, and considers indications for testosterone use.

### International society for the study of women's sexual health clinical practice guideline for the use of systemic testosterone for hypoactive sexual desire disorder in women [^87fb4e23]. Journal of Women's Health (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Government-approved testosterone therapy for women is not currently available worldwide, presumably because of the lack of long-term efficacy and safety data and the barriers to product development and approval. Systemic transdermal testosterone therapy is recommended by the Global Position Statement for postmenopausal women; in this Clinical Practice Guideline, testosterone is recommended for postmenopausal and late reproductive age women with HSDD. Current available research supports a moderate therapeutic benefit. Available safety data show no serious adverse events with physiologic testosterone use, but long-term safety has not been established. Using established clinical guidance, such as the ISSWSH POC for the management of HSDD, the diagnosis should include a thorough biopsychosocial clinical assessment that leads to identification, modification, and management of contributing factors before testosterone therapy is considered. Before initiation of therapy, patients should receive informed consent, and shared decision-making should involve a comprehensive discussion of off-label use, as well as benefits and risks. A total testosterone level should not be used to diagnose HSDD. Total testosterone is recommended as the best available measure, rather than free or bioavailable testosterone or FAI. Transdermal formulations can be used cautiously with dosing appropriate for women, and signs of androgen excess and total testosterone levels must be monitored routinely to maintain women in the physiologic premenopausal range. The Global Position Statement, the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine Report, and this Clinical Practice Guideline recommend against the use of compounded testosterone.

Although the FDA and other government agencies acknowledge the treatment of HSDD in postmenopausal women as a significant unmet need, barriers to regulatory approval for a female testosterone product are formidable. Most important is the lack of guidance as to the types of studies, end points, results, and safety data required for approval, in contrast to the clear pathway for testosterone products for men. More clinical trial evidence demonstrating longer and more robust testosterone safety data is integral to the development, submission, and regulatory approval of testosterone preparations specifically indicated and designed for women.

Patients with chronic illness and low testosterone concentrations — treatment individualization: Many chronic disorders are associated with an increased risk of low testosterone concentrations and related symptoms, but the paucity of randomized controlled trial data on efficacy or safety precludes a general recommendation for testosterone therapy in these conditions. Clinicians must individualize the decision to treat or not to treat based on the severity of symptoms, the degree of testosterone deficiency, confounding effects of the comorbid illness, patient preferences, and the uncertainty of the risks and benefits of therapy.

### Androgen therapy in women: a reappraisal: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^66eb4f1c]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Medium credibility.

Androgen therapy in women — Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline conclusions state that the GRADE methodology was used; the strength of a recommendation is indicated by a number "1" (strong recommendation, we recommend) or "2" (weak recommendation, we suggest). We continue to recommend against making a diagnosis of androgen deficiency syndrome in healthy women because there is a lack of a well-defined syndrome, and data correlating androgen levels with specific signs or symptoms are unavailable. We recommend against the general use of T for the following indications: infertility; sexual dysfunction other than hypoactive sexual desire disorder; cognitive, cardiovascular, metabolic, or bone health; or general well-being. We recommend against the routine use of dehydroepiandrosterone due to limited data concerning its effectiveness and safety in normal women or those with adrenal insufficiency. We recommend against the routine prescription of T or dehydroepiandrosterone for the treatment of women with low androgen levels due to hypopituitarism, adrenal insufficiency, surgical menopause, pharmacological glucocorticoid administration, or other conditions associated with low androgen levels because there are limited data supporting improvement in signs and symptoms with therapy and no long-term studies of risk. Evidence supports the short-term efficacy and safety of high physiological doses of T treatment of postmenopausal women with sexual dysfunction due to hypoactive sexual desire disorder, and endogenous T levels did not predict response to therapy. At present, physiological T preparations for use in women are not available in many countries including the United States, and long-term safety data are lacking. We recommend that any woman receiving T therapy be monitored for signs and symptoms of androgen excess.

### Osteoporosis in men: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^3065832a]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Medium credibility.

Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline — testosterone therapy recommendations: Our recommendation to treat men with testosterone if they have hypogonadism due to organic disease or symptoms of androgen deficiency is consistent with the current standard of care in these men. Our suggestion to add a pharmacological agent to treat osteoporosis if fracture risk is high reflects the convincing fracture-prevention data in women treated with bisphosphonates or teriparatide and the lack of fracture-prevention data in men treated with testosterone. Our suggestion that testosterone alone be considered if such men have a modest or borderline risk of fracture reflects our desire to manage both the hypogonadism and the low BMD with a single agent, thus reducing costs and the risk of medication side effects, as well as our belief that it is likely that the beneficial effects of testosterone on BMD in hypogonadal men indicate that it will also reduce fracture risk.

### International society for the study of women's sexual health clinical practice guideline for the use of systemic testosterone for hypoactive sexual desire disorder in women [^5540538b]. Journal of Women's Health (2021). Medium credibility.

Dosing

Before prescribing testosterone therapy, clinicians should obtain informed consent. They should explain that for women it is an off-label therapy, counsel regarding the benefits and risks through shared decision-making recognizing patient's goals and concerns, and provide detailed documentation of the discussion.

Dosing should be targeted to achieve testosterone concentrations in the physiologic premenopausal range. In a study of premenopausal women with no complaints of sexual dysfunction intended to define normal female androgen values, women aged 20–29 years, 30–39 years, and 40–49 years had testosterone values ranging from 45.5 to 57.5 ng/dl, 27.6 to 39.8 ng/dl, and 27.0 to 38.6 ng/dl, respectively. This range is approximately 1/10th–1/15th of the systemic testosterone values in healthy men (range 300–800 ng/dl). Thus, treatment using any male product for women should be initiated using one-tenth of the recommended starting dose for men.

### Safety of testosterone treatment in postmenopausal women [^31debfa4]. Fertility and Sterility (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To critically examine the safety of T therapy given to postmenopausal women.

Design

MEDLINE literature review, cross-reference of published data, and review of Food and Drug Administration transcripts.

Result(S)

Although some retrospective and observational studies provide some long-term safety data, most prospective studies have had a duration of 2 years or less. In addition, with the exception of the female-to-male transsexuals, T was administered in conjunction with estrogens or estrogens and progestins, which confound the interpretation of some of the studies. The major adverse reactions are the androgenic side effects of hirsutism and acne. There does not appear to be an increase in cardiovascular risk factors, with the exception of a lowering of high-density lipoprotein with oral T. There are little data on endometrial safety, and most of the experimental data support a neutral or beneficial effect in regards to breast cancer. There does not appear to be an increased risk of hepatotoxicity, neurobehavioral abnormalities, sleep apnea, or fetal virilization (in premenopausal women) with the physiologic treatment doses of T.

Conclusion(S)

Except for hirsutism and acne, the therapeutic administration of T in physiologic doses is safe for up to several years. However, prospectively collected long-term safety studies are needed to provide a greater degree of assurance.

### Testosterone therapy: review of clinical applications [^03844246]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Testosterone therapy is increasingly common in the United States, and many of these prescriptions are written by primary care physicians. There is conflicting evidence on the benefit of male testosterone therapy for age-related declines in testosterone. Physicians should not measure testosterone levels unless a patient has signs and symptoms of hypogonadism, such as loss of body hair, sexual dysfunction, hot flashes, or gynecomastia. Depressed mood, fatigue, decreased strength, and a decreased sense of vitality are less specific to male hypogonadism. Testosterone therapy should be initiated only after two morning total serum testosterone measurements show decreased levels, and all patients should be counseled on the potential risks and benefits before starting therapy. Potential benefits of therapy include increased libido, improved sexual function, improved mood and well-being, and increased muscle mass and bone density; however, there is little or mixed evidence confirming clinically significant benefits. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration warns that testosterone therapy may increase the risk of cardiovascular complications. Other possible risks include rising prostate-specific antigen levels, worsening lower urinary tract symptoms, polycythemia, and increased risk of venous thromboembolism. Patients receiving testosterone therapy should be monitored to ensure testosterone levels rise appropriately, clinical improvement occurs, and no complications develop. Testosterone therapy may also be used to treat hypoactive sexual desire disorder in postmenopausal women and to produce physical male sex characteristics in female-to-male transgender patients.

### Androgens in postmenopausal women: a review [^abb24bab]. Menopause (2017). Low credibility.

There is significant interest in the use of androgen therapy for postmenopausal women. This review provides background on endogenous androgens in women, describes factors that affect circulating androgen concentrations, and examines the relationship between low levels of androgens and sexual problems. Possible effects of androgens in postmenopausal women beyond sexual function also are discussed. Clinical trials of androgen therapy for the treatment of hypoactive sexual desire disorder are reviewed, with a discussion of potential risks. A practical approach to using androgens to treat low sexual desire with associated distress is presented, accompanied by an illustrative case.

### Androgen therapy in women: a reappraisal: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^f0316e1e]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Medium credibility.

Generalized use of testosterone in women — We recommend against the generalized use of T by women for infertility, sexual dysfunction (except for specific diagnosis of HSSD; see recommendation 4.1); cognitive dysfunction, cardiovascular dysfunction, metabolic dysfunction, bone health, or well-being, noting there are no clear indications for these uses, evidence of safety in long-term studies is lacking, and government agency-approved and monitored dose-appropriate preparations are not widely available.

### Testosterone treatment in adult men with age-related low testosterone: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^8a9e7439]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Evidence gaps — Because studies have had limited follow-up, evidence on long-term benefits or harms of testosterone treatment is lacking, and evidence about mortality also is inconclusive because of very serious imprecision, low event rates, and potential fragility of the results; most studies in the evidence review followed patients for 12 months or less, so the longer-term benefits and harms of testosterone treatment are unknown.

Testosterone is an important evidence-based therapy for hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) in postmenopausal women. Clinical practice guidelines based on the most comprehensive meta-analysis of benefits and risks of testosterone therapy to date state that the sole evidence-based indication for testosterone therapy is HSDD in postmenopausal women. The guidelines also provide recommendations regarding identification of patients, dosing, monitoring, and follow-up. This Practice Pearl will discuss evidence-based testosterone therapy for management of HSDD in postmenopausal women.

### Androgen therapy in women: a reappraisal: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^a11d3f0b]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To update practice guidelines for the therapeutic use of androgens in women.

Participants

A Task Force appointed by the Endocrine Society, American Congress of Obestricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM), European Society of Endocrinology (ESE), and International Menopause Society (IMS) consisting of six experts, a methodologist, and a medical writer.

Evidence

The Task Force commissioned two systematic reviews of published data and considered several other existing meta-analyses and trials. The GRADE methodology was used; the strength of a recommendation is indicated by a number "1" (strong recommendation, we recommend) or "2" (weak recommendation, we suggest).

Consensus Process

Multiple e-mail communications and conference calls determined consensus. Committees of the Endocrine Society, ASRM, ACOG, ESE, and IMS reviewed and commented on the drafts of the guidelines.

Conclusions

We continue to recommend against making a diagnosis of androgen deficiency syndrome in healthy women because there is a lack of a well-defined syndrome, and data correlating androgen levels with specific signs or symptoms are unavailable. We recommend against the general use of T for the following indications: infertility; sexual dysfunction other than hypoactive sexual desire disorder; cognitive, cardiovascular, metabolic, or bone health; or general well-being. We recommend against the routine use of dehydroepiandrosterone due to limited data concerning its effectiveness and safety in normal women or those with adrenal insufficiency. We recommend against the routine prescription of T or dehydroepiandrosterone for the treatment of women with low androgen levels due to hypopituitarism, adrenal insufficiency, surgical menopause, pharmacological glucocorticoid administration, or other conditions associated with low androgen levels because there are limited data supporting improvement in signs and symptoms with therapy and no long-term studies of risk. Evidence supports the short-term efficacy and safety of high physiological doses of T treatment of postmenopausal women with sexual dysfunction due to hypoactive sexual desire disorder. Importantly, endogenous T levels did not predict response to therapy. At present, physiological T preparations for use in women are not available in many countries including the United States, and long-term safety data are lacking. We recommend that any woman receiving T therapy be monitored for signs and symptoms of androgen excess. We outline areas for future research. Ongoing improvement in androgen assays will allow a redefinition of normal ranges across the lifespan; this may help to clarify the impact of varying concentrations of plasma androgens on the biology, physiology, and psychology in women and lead to indications for therapeutic interventions.

### Management of female sexual dysfunction in postmenopausal women by testosterone administration: safety issues and controversies [^37798637]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

A Food and Drug Administration advisory group has questioned the long-term safety of testosterone administration to postmenopausal women. Although only short-term data exist on safety from the double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, testosterone has been used for more than 50 years. Therefore, some data concerning the long-term safety issues must exist in the literature.

Aim

To review the published data concerning the safety of administration of testosterone to women.

Methods

Review of published articles identified by a search of the Ovid databases and bibliographies from articles identified as dealing with the topics of testosterone or androgen treatment of women.

Results

The major adverse reactions to exogenous androgens are the expected androgenic side effects of hirsutism and acne. High-density lipoprotein levels may be decreased with oral androgens. There are insufficient long-term safety data regarding breast, endometrium, or heart safety to draw strong conclusions, although the data available to date are reassuring.

Conclusions

Testosterone administration to postmenopausal women that result in physiological to slightly supraphysiological serum-free testosterone levels is safe for at least 2 years.

### Testosterone replacement therapy and cardiovascular disease [^c263d6a9]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2022). Medium credibility.

The use of testosterone therapy has a complex history of apprehension and questions regarding its safety. Despite an eventual consensus that testosterone therapy was safe and effective, several studies relating to cardiovascular risks emerged in the last decade, rekindling skepticism regarding the safety of testosterone therapy. Given the utility of testosterone therapy in treating the symptoms of hypogonadism, it remains crucial to closely examine the safety of testosterone therapy. The present article synthesizes the current evidence regarding cardiovascular risks that may be associated with testosterone therapy, the potential mechanisms regarding testosterone's efficacy, and future directions in evaluating the safety of its use.

### Testosterone therapy for menopausal women [^ff4fded6]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2017). Low credibility.

It has been suggested that there is a link between low circulating concentrations of testosterone and reduced sexual functioning in postmenopausal women, 1 and it has been more than 60 years since the effects of testosterone therapy for the management of menopausal symptoms were first reported. 2 Since then, testosterone supplementation has received growing attention for its potential role in maintaining sexual function in menopausal women. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guideline on the diagnosis and management of menopause recommends considering testosterone supplementation for women with low sexual desire if hormone replacement therapy (HRT) alone has been ineffective. 3 However, in the UK no testosterone products are licensed for such use. A testosterone patch authorised by the European Medicines Agency in 2006 for use in women with surgical menopause was withdrawn from the market in 2012 for commercial reasons. 4 Here, we provide an update on the evidence of the effectiveness and safety of testosterone supplementation in menopausal women.

### Evidence-based guideline: premature ovarian insufficiency [^d754ab4c]. Fertility and Sterility (2025). High credibility.

Premature ovarian insufficiency — role of testosterone therapy: Testosterone treatment should be considered in women with iatrogenic POI to manage hypoactive sexual desire disorder when other biopsychosocial aetiologies are excluded. Testosterone treatment could be considered in women with non-iatrogenic POI to manage hypoactive sexual desire disorder when other biopsychosocial aetiologies are excluded. HCPs should be aware that although short term treatment with transdermal testosterone at doses approximating physiological premenopausal levels is safe, longer term safety data are lacking. The guideline group recommends that women with POI are informed that there are limited data for androgen treatment for indications other than hypoactive sexual desire disorder, and that long-term health effects are unknown.

### Testosterone replacement therapy in naturally and surgically menopausal women [^282855df]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

Testosterone replacement therapy in naturally and surgically menopausal women is a complex and currently highly debated topic. Opposing guidelines for the use of testosterone exist, which create a therapeutic dilemma for clinicians confronted by severely distressed women who experience a decrease in sexual desire after surgical or natural menopause.

Aim

In this review, we will address the current knowledge on androgen physiology, conditions associated with a low androgen state, and risks and benefits of androgen therapy.

Methods

An English-language Medline review was performed.

Main Outcome Measure

Review of available literature.

Results

A review of normal androgen physiology in women is summarized and a brief review of prior use of androgens over the last six decades is included. The data on the use of androgen replacement in pre- and postmenopausal women is evaluated, especially its relationship to sexual functioning. Special concerns about the effect of androgens on cardiovascular disease, breast, and endometrial tissue are discussed. The balance of evidence seems to show that androgens have more of a positive effect than a negative effect in women if used properly.

Conclusions

Testosterone replacement therapy for surgically and naturally menopausal women with low sexual desire can be accomplished physiologically and effectively after ruling out other medical conditions leading to low sexual desire and after proper information of the patient that testosterone therapy is not an FDA-approved medication in the United States. The majority of available data suggests that testosterone replacement in women can be used safely without increased risk of endometrial or breast cancer.

### Global consensus position statement on the use of testosterone therapy for women [^f532c274]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

(13) Recommendations regarding other androgenic preparations Systemic dehydroepiandrosterone is not associated with significant improvement in libido or sexual function in postmenopausal women with normal adrenal function and cannot be recommended for women with HSDD (Level IA, Grade A). In the absence of vulvovaginal atrophy, vaginal dehydroepiandrosterone has not been tested and thus cannot be recommended for treatment of HSDD (Expert Opinion).

(14) Recommendations regarding the design of future trials of physiologically dosed testosterone (Expert Opinion for all) More adequately powered, double-blind RCTs, without selection bias and with consistent reporting of standardized outcomes, are needed to comprehensively establish the benefits and risks of testosterone therapy for women. For studies of testosterone and FSD:order Relief of the distress associated with sexual dysfunction is a primary aim of FSD treatment. Presently, no questionnaire covers all domains of female sexual function such that a combination of domains from different questionnaires should be used. Satisfying sexual events should no longer be used as a primary efficacy measurement in clinical trials of women with FSD. A set of clearly defined core outcomes needs to be established. There is a need for an instrument to assess sexual function with the following characteristics: general applicability; not disease-specific; high discriminant validity between women diagnosed with FSD and sexually functional women; validated, to measure FSD per se and as an instrument to screen for and diagnose FSD and demonstrating clinically meaningful response to intervention; cover different domains, with each domain comprising several items; translated and back-translated in a variety of languages, satisfies the most stringent assessment to gain approval by regulatory agencies. There is a need for adequately powered RCTs of the effects of testosterone on the musculoskeletal health of women with normal bone mass, low bone mass, osteopenia/osteoporosis, and sarcopenia, with outcomes including vertebral and total hip and femoral neck bone mineral density, trabecular bone score, serum biomarkers, fracture risk, body composition, and muscle strength. There is a need for adequately powered RCTs of the effects of testosterone on cognitive performance. Studies must be undertaken to establish the longer term cardiometabolic and breast safety of testosterone therapy for women.

### Androgen therapy for loss of desire in women: is the benefit worth the breast cancer risk? [^4eda0ddd]. Fertility and Sterility (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To contrast the limited evidence that androgen therapy is an effective treatment for low sexual desire in women with the extensive literature suggesting that androgens promote breast cancer.

Design

Evidence from population studies of women is reviewed on the association between endogenous androgen levels and sexual function or satisfaction. Recent randomized trials of testosterone therapy for low desire are critiqued in terms of methodology and generalizability. Research on endogenous testosterone levels and breast cancer risk in both premenopausal and postmenopausal women is summarized, as are recent studies of androgenic hormonal therapy and breast cancer risk.

Setting

Literature review.

Patient(S)

Not applicable.

Intervention(S)

Not applicable.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Not applicable.

Result(S)

Endogenous androgen levels are not correlated with sexual desire in population-based studies of aging women. Factors that are strongly associated with low desire include pain with sexual activity, emotional distress, life stress, and relationship conflict. The efficacy of testosterone therapy for women's desire problems is modest. Expectancy effects were not adequately controlled in randomized trials. Epidemiological findings agree that higher endogenous serum androgen levels confer increased breast cancer risk both before and after menopause. Androgenic hormonal replacement regimens also increase the risk of breast cancer.

Conclusion(S)

Testosterone supplementation should not be prescribed to women with low sexual desire unless long-term studies can demonstrate its efficacy and safety. Treatments for low sexual desire in women should address its common correlates: relationship distress, emotional distress, and dyspareunia.

Androgen safety profile with transdermal testosterone — adverse effects and long-term risk: The main adverse effects associated with testosterone therapy in women are hirsutism, acne, and virilization including voice deepening and clitoral enlargement, and these adverse effects may be irreversible with long-term safety data lacking. A 2014 systematic review concluded there was no evidence that transdermal testosterone therapy increased the risk of cardiovascular disease in women, although the effects of long-term testosterone use on cardiovascular disease risk are not known. The effects of long-term use of testosterone on breast cancer risk or other cancer risk also are unknown, and limited existing data focus primarily on the risk of estrogen plus testosterone on breast cancer risk, not testosterone alone.

### The effect of statins on testosterone in men and women, a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^009900da]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The clinical significance of this reduction in testosterone with statins is difficult to gauge. The normal range of testosterone is wide and sexual function similar across the range. Erectile dysfunction is a rare side effect of statins, perhaps because statins' have beneficial effects on cardiovascular function that would counteract changes of this magnitude in testosterone. However, large changes in testosterone (and libido) can occasionally occur with statin use, which are reversible by statin withdrawal. The impact on population health may be more germane, where statins causing diabetes could be another side effect. We are not aware of any study examining whether lowering testosterone mediates the effect of statins on diabetes, as this possibility has not, to the best of our knowledge, been considered before, and remains speculative. Moreover, observational studies suggest serum testosterone has sex-specific physiological effects on diabetes, negative among men, but positive among women, when statins increase diabetes in both sexes. We could not identify any RCT confirming testosterone therapy increases diabetes incidence among women. In postmenopausal women, RCTs of testosterone therapy indicate little effect on glucose metabolism. In younger women, some RCTs indicate that low doses of testosterone may improve glucose metabolism; female to male transsexuals given high doses of testosterone have improved glucose metabolism. Nevertheless, distinct effects of testosterone on diabetes may occur by dose, sex and age with the reduction in testosterone with statin treatment insufficient to modulate diabetes risk consistently. This meta-analysis also raises the question as to whether lowering testosterone is a side effect of statin therapy or contributes to statins' mode of action, which could inform new treatments and prevention policies. Observationally testosterone is inversely associated with cardiovascular mortality; whether testosterone is causal or a marker of health is unknown. No RCT has shown testosterone therapy reduces cardiovascular events; two RCTs of testosterone therapy were halted because of adverse, mainly cardiovascular events, among men allocated to testosterone. Natural experiments suggest lower testosterone protects against specifically ischemic heart disease mortality, with a relatively lower risk in men legally castrated or with Klinefelter's syndrome. Physiologically lowering testosterone may reduce thromboxane and platelet activation, specifically relevant to reducing ischemic cardiovascular disease but not to diabetes. However, whether lowering testosterone with statin treatment modulates cardiovascular disease, via these or other pathways, has not been examined.

Side effects and safety of testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) — Masculinizing effects include acne, hirsutism, deepening of the voice, and androgenic alopecia, and these effects are dose related and uncommon in relatively short-term trials if supraphysiological levels are avoided; compared with placebo, women treated with TTP in studies of 1 year or less report a higher rate of androgenic adverse events, mainly increased nonscalp hair growth; in APHRODITE, the 150 or 300 μg/d doses of T were not associated with increased rates of acne, alopecia, or voice change over 12 months, although a higher rate of hair growth occurred with the 300 μg/d dose; clitoromegaly has not emerged as a side effect of transdermal therapy across multiple studies, and withdrawal due to androgenic events has not been less common in women treated with TTP than in controls.

### Monitoring of testosterone replacement therapy to optimize the benefit-to-risk ratio [^88a073a3]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

For hypogonadal men treated with testosterone, the goal is to ensure that benefits are optimized, risks are minimized, and any adverse effects are identified early and managed appropriately. This can best be achieved by careful patient selection, excluding men with contraindications and addressing any modifiable risk factors in those at increased risk. A standardized plan should be used for monitoring that includes evaluation of symptoms, side effects, adherence, and measurement of testosterone and hematocrit. Shared decision making should be used to determine whether to screen for prostate cancer and informed by age, baseline cancer risk, and patient preference.

### Testosterone therapy in women: its role in the management of hypoactive sexual desire disorder [^05d81b73]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2007). Low credibility.

Disorders of sexual dysfunction occur in nearly half of women during their life, and hypoactive sexual desire disorder accounts for most of those complaints. Although the relationship between low endogenous testosterone levels and sexual desire disorders in women has not been empirically established, clinical trials have shown that exogenous testosterone therapy improves arousability, sexual desire and fantasy, frequency of sexual activity and orgasm, and satisfaction and pleasure from the sexual act. Its therapeutic role in bone mineral density, fatigue, well-being and hot flashes requires more study before specific recommendations can be made. Potential adverse effects of testosterone therapy include hirsutism, acne and deepening of the voice along with changes in lipid profiles. While less well understood, concern after increased risks for breast cancer and cardiovascular events has been raised about this therapy. Testosterone therapy is available in various formulations; the most commonly used are oral and transdermal, including patches, gels, creams and ointments.

### Do statins lower testosterone and does it matter? [^0676141a]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In this first meta-analysis of the issue, Schooling et al. report that statins lower serum testosterone in both men and women, a potentially important finding. Unfortunately, the clinical implications of this observation are less clear than they could be because the only data available to them were the average changes in testosterone induced by statins. While the average changes may be small, the range of changes in individuals, potentially, might be much more substantial. The problem is that we have become accustomed to expressing the effects of our therapies in terms of the average changes in groups as opposed to also considering the range of changes in individuals. We need to acknowledge this shortcoming if we are going to learn more about the benefits and risks of drugs and really understand whether side effects, as reported by Schooling et al. truly matter.

### Female sexual dysfunction: ACOG practice bulletin clinical management guidelines for obstetrician-gynecologists, number 213 [^4d305473]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Postmenopausal management with transdermal testosterone — trial duration and monitoring: Short-term use can be considered as a treatment option for postmenopausal women with sexual interest and arousal disorders who have been appropriately counseled about the potential risks and unknown long-term effects. If used, a 3–6-month trial is recommended with assessment of testosterone levels at baseline and after 3–6 weeks of initial use to ensure levels remain within the normal range for reproductive-aged women. Therapy should be discontinued at 6 months in patients who do not show a response, and if ongoing therapy is used, follow-up clinical evaluation and testosterone measurement every 6 months are recommended to assess for androgen excess. The long-term safety and efficacy of transdermal testosterone have not been studied, and based on randomized controlled data that support efficacy and safety for as long as 6 months, transdermal testosterone therapy can be considered for short-term use in postmenopausal women with female sexual interest and arousal disorder (formerly hypoactive sexual desire disorder).

### Androgen therapy in women [^e9310459]. Journal of Women's Health (2020). Medium credibility.

Androgens are believed to have an important biologic role in women, particularly in regulation of libido and sexual arousal, although much about their function on other systems in women is unknown. Testosterone, the primary ovarian androgen, has been used to treat carefully selected postmenopausal women with hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD). However, testosterone use in women has not been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) because of uncertainties regarding the effectiveness and long-term safety of this strategy. An intravaginal form of the adrenal androgen, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) has been approved by the FDA to treat genitourinary syndrome of menopause. In this article, we review the current knowledge regarding the role of androgens and their clinical use in women. We conducted a systematic search of PubMed for publications describing the role and clinical use of androgens in women. We used the search terms "HSDD", "DHEA in women", "testosterone in women", and "androgens in women", and reviewed most references from all relevant articles. Most randomized placebo-controlled trials show an improvement in sexual function with low-dose testosterone therapy in select postmenopausal women with HSDD. Although this strategy appears to be safe in the short term and no major safety concerns have emerged thus far, long-term effects on cardiovascular risk and breast cancer incidence are not known. A trial of low-dose testosterone therapy may be considered for carefully selected postmenopausal women with HSDD, as long as other contributors to sexual dysfunction have been adequately addressed. However, patients need careful counseling regarding the lack of long-term safety data, and close clinical and laboratory monitoring of these women is recommended to avoid supraphysiologic dosing.

### Testosterone treatment in adult men with age-related low testosterone: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^3546ab3e]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). High credibility.

American College of Physicians GRADE framework — grading certainty of evidence and recommendations is defined as follows: High certainty is described as "Confident that the true effect is close to the estimated effect", Moderate certainty is "Moderately confident in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely close to the estimated effect, but there is a sizeable possibility that it is substantially different", and Low certainty is "Confidence in the effect estimate is limited: The true effect may be substantially different from the estimated effect". Recommendation strength includes Strong, where there is "Confidence that benefits clearly outweigh risks and burden or vice versa", it "Applies to most patients in most circumstances", and "Only strong recommendations should be considered as quality indicators to guide the development of accountability, reporting, and payment programs"; and Conditional, where "Benefits probably outweigh risks and burden, or vice versa, but there is appreciable uncertainty", it "Applies to many patients but may differ depending on circumstances or patients' values and preferences", and "Policy making will require substantial debates and involvement of many stakeholders. Policies are also more likely to vary between regions. Quality indicators would have to focus on the fact that adequate deliberation about the management options has taken place".

### Androgen therapy in women: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^292b7e6e]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective was to provide guidelines for the therapeutic use of androgens in women.

Participants

The Task Force was composed of a chair, selected by the Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee (CGS) of The Endocrine Society, six additional experts, a methodologist, and a medical writer. The Task Force received no corporate funding or remuneration.

Evidence

The Task Force used systematic reviews of available evidence to inform its key recommendations. The Task Force used consistent language and graphical descriptions of both the strength of recommendation and the quality of evidence, using the recommendations of the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) group. The strength of a recommendation is indicated by the number 1 (strong recommendation, associated with the phrase "we recommend") or 2 (weak recommendation, associated with the phrase "we suggest"). The quality of the evidence is indicated by cross-filled circles, such that [1 cross-filled circle, 3 empty circles] denotes very-low-quality evidence, [2 cross-filled circles, 2 empty circles] low quality, [3 cross-filled circles, 1 empty circle] moderate quality, and [4 cross-filled circles] high quality. Each recommendation is followed by a description of the evidence.

Consensus Process

Consensus was guided by systematic reviews of evidence and discussions during one group meeting, several conference calls, and e-mail communications. The drafts prepared by the task force with the help of a medical writer were reviewed successively by The Endocrine Society's CGS, Clinical Affairs Committee (CAC), and Executive Committee. The version approved by the CGS and CAC was placed on The Endocrine Society's web site for comments by members. At each stage of review, the Task Force received written comments and incorporated needed changes.

Conclusions

We recommend against making a diagnosis of androgen deficiency in women at present because of the lack of a well-defined clinical syndrome and normative data on total or free testosterone levels across the lifespan that can be used to define the disorder. Although there is evidence for short-term efficacy of testosterone in selected populations, such as surgically menopausal women, we recommend against the generalized use of testosterone by women because the indications are inadequate and evidence of safety in long-term studies is lacking. A review of the data currently available is presented, and areas of future research are outlined. To formulate clinical guidelines for use of testosterone in women, additional information will be necessary. This includes defining conditions that, when not treated with androgens, have adverse health consequences to women; defining clinical and laboratory parameters that distinguish those with these conditions; and assessing the efficacy and long-term safety of androgen administration on outcomes that are important to women diagnosed with these conditions. This necessary clinical research cannot occur until the biological, physiological, and psychological underpinnings of the role of androgens in women and candidate disorders are further elucidated.

### Management of male breast cancer: ASCO guideline [^cfcb3ab2]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2020). High credibility.

ASCO male breast cancer guideline — endocrine therapy toxicity management states that management of endocrine therapy toxicity is similar to the approach used for women (Type: formal consensus; Evidence quality: low; Strength of recommendation: moderate), and that testosterone/androgen supplementation should not be used by men with breast cancer (Type: formal consensus; Evidence quality: low; Strength of recommendation: moderate). There is no evidence from clinical trials in men with breast cancer to inform clinical questions regarding the optimal management of endocrine therapy toxicity in men, and the consensus review identified four studies of adverse effects, including an increased incidence of thrombotic events in men treated with tamoxifen, more than 80% of which occurred in the first 18 months after the start of treatment, and a high rate of treatment discontinuation due to adverse effects. For hot flashes, venlafaxine has been shown to be an effective treatment of hot flashes in men with prostate cancer who were receiving GnRH analogs and may be effective in reducing hot flashes in men with breast cancer treated with tamoxifen or GnRH analogs. With respect to testosterone, its conversion to estrogen by aromatase raises concern about its use among men with hormone receptor–positive breast cancer, and use of exogenous testosterone for hypogonadism among men with a history of hormone receptor–positive breast cancer should follow an informed discussion about the potential benefits and risks of this treatment, considering the patient's residual risk of breast cancer recurrence.

### Efficacy and safety of testosterone in the management of hypoactive sexual desire disorder in postmenopausal women [^17d3f34d]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) is a common problem in postmenopausal women, but in the absence of an approved medical treatment in the United States, off-label testosterone use is widespread. Large, randomized controlled studies have demonstrated that transdermal testosterone improves sexual function and activity in postmenopausal women and has favorable short-term safety. However, a longer-term safety profile of testosterone must be established before a testosterone product for women is approved.

Aim

To review current knowledge of the efficacy and safety of transdermal testosterone based on presentations at a satellite symposium during the 2011 annual meeting of the International Society for the Study of Women's Sexual Health.

Methods

Pertinent information included in the presentations was augmented with relevant articles from the peer-reviewed literature.

Main Outcome Measures

The rationale for testosterone therapy and results from phase III and other clinical studies with the testosterone patch in postmenopausal women with HSDD and findings from studies investigating the cardiovascular, breast, and endometrial effects of testosterone therapy.

Results

Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies have established the efficacy of the transdermal testosterone patch for relieving symptoms of HSDD in surgically and naturally menopausal women with and without concomitant estrogen or estrogen/progestin therapy. The main side effects reported in clinical trials were increased hair growth and acne. Available safety data for testosterone, although not conclusive, were reassuring with respect to cardiovascular, breast, and endometrial outcomes. Interim data from a long-term phase III safety trial of a testosterone gel demonstrate a continued low rate of cardiovascular events and breast cancer in postmenopausal women at increased cardiovascular risk.

Conclusion

Transdermal testosterone appears to be an effective and safe therapy for postmenopausal women with HSDD.

### Efficacy and safety of testosterone treatment in men: an evidence report for a clinical practice guideline by the American College of Physicians [^67ca17ff]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Testosterone treatment rates in adult men have increased in the United States over the past 2 decades.

Purpose

To assess the benefits and harms of testosterone treatment for men without underlying organic causes of hypogonadism.

Data Sources

English-language searches of multiple electronic databases (January 1980 to May 2019) and reference lists from systematic reviews.

Study Selection

38 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of at least 6 months' duration that evaluated transdermal or intramuscular testosterone therapies versus placebo or no treatment and reported prespecified patient-centered outcomes, as well as 20 long-term observational studies, U.S. Food and Drug Administration review data, and product labels that reported harms information.

Data Extraction

Data extraction by a single investigator was confirmed by a second, 2 investigators assessed risk of bias, and evidence certainty was determined by consensus.

Data Synthesis

Studies enrolled mostly older men who varied in age, symptoms, and testosterone eligibility criteria. Testosterone therapy improved sexual functioning and quality of life in men with low testosterone levels, although effect sizes were small (low- to moderate-certainty evidence). Testosterone therapy had little to no effect on physical functioning, depressive symptoms, energy and vitality, or cognition. Harms evidence reported in trials was judged to be insufficient or of low certainty for most harm outcomes. No trials were powered to assess cardiovascular events or prostate cancer, and trials often excluded men at increased risk for these conditions. Observational studies were limited by confounding by indication and contraindication.

Limitation

Few trials exceeded a 1-year duration, minimum important outcome differences were often not established or reported, RCTs were not powered to assess important harms, few data were available in men aged 18 to 50 years, definitions of low testosterone varied, and study entry criteria varied.

Conclusion

In older men with low testosterone levels without well-established medical conditions known to cause hypogonadism, testosterone therapy may provide small improvements in sexual functioning and quality of life but little to no benefit for other common symptoms of aging. Long-term efficacy and safety are unknown.

Most of clinical investigations in the past 2 decades have focused on transdermal testosterone patches with release rates of 150 mcg and 300 mcg/24h. Accordingly, a meta-analysis of safety outcomes and adverse events reported from 7 trials, enrolling 3,035 participants, randomized to transdermal testosterone 300 mcg or placebo, either on or not on estrogen-progestin hormone therapy and followed for 24 weeks found that total androgenic adverse events were increased (hazard ratio 1.37; 95% CI, 1.12–1.69), including acne (hazard ratio 1.41; 95% CI, 1.05–1.88) and hair growth (hazard ratio 1.56; 95% CI, 1.17–2.09), without evidence of alopecia, clitoromegaly, or voice deepening. Serum lipid profiles, carbohydrate metabolism, cardiometabolic markers, and renal and liver functions, were similar among treatment and control groups. Mammographic breast density did not change with transdermal testosterone treatment in several small trials with insufficient data to assess long-term breast cancer risk. Although data are limited, there were no significant differences in total adverse events, serious adverse events, or withdrawal rates from the studies. Safety data from RCTs using testosterone in physiologic doses are not available beyond 24 months of treatment.

Men with hypogonadism prescribed daily 1% generic testosterone gel use 30 tubes or packets per month; the starting dose for women with HSDD should be one-tenth of a tube or packet each day or 3 tubes per month. Resealable tubes are much preferred to packets to avoid evaporation and resulting change in testosterone concentration in the gel; tubes should be specified when prescribing testosterone gel. Using resealable tubes at room temperature, one-tenth of a male dose is approximately 4 drops/day. With the 1% cream available in Australia, the recommended starting dose is 5 mg/day testosterone (0.5 ml), which may be titrated to 10 mg/day (1.0 ml) as needed.

These topical preparations should be applied to a skin surface, typically the back of the calf or the upper outer thigh (at least an hour after shaving) or the buttock. The patient should be counseled about potential transference of testosterone from the application site to the skin of individuals (young children, female partners) and pets with whom the woman has close contact, while the risk of exposure to a male partner is minimal. The FDA warnings for men should be explained to women including the need to wash hands immediately with soap and water after application of gel. If contact does occur, the residual testosterone can be washed off with soap and water. Long-term continual exposure may result in signs of virilization, changes in body hair, and acne although these adverse effects are described in case reports of transference from men to women and children.

Patients should be monitored for clinical response to treatment, including increase in sexual desire and decrease in personal distress. Based on clinical trial data, they should be counseled that on average efficacy emerges 6–8 weeks after initiation of therapy, but many women feel improvement after 4 weeks. Maximal effects in sexual desire and satisfactory sexual events occur at about 12 weeks. Reductions in sexually associated personal distress are seen at about 4 weeks, and distress continues to decline over the following 5–6 months of therapy.

Although the self-report validated instruments that assess outcomes similar to those used in clinical trials (e.g. Female Sexual Function Index, Female Sexual Distress Scale-Revised), can be administered to assess sexual desire and associated distress, clinical response is generally based on the clinician and patient dialog and conclusions regarding subjective, qualitative improvements.

5.4 Venous Thromboembolism

There have been postmarketing reports of venous thromboembolic events, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), in patients using testosterone products such as testosterone gel, 1.62%. Evaluate patients who report symptoms of pain, edema, warmth and erythema in the lower extremity for DVT and those who present with acute shortness of breath for PE. If a venous thromboembolic event is suspected, discontinue treatment with testosterone gel, 1.62% and initiate appropriate workup and management [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

5.5 Cardiovascular Risk

Long term clinical safety trials have not been conducted to assess the cardiovascular outcomes of testosterone replacement therapy in men. To date, epidemiologic studies and randomized controlled trials have been inconclusive for determining the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), such as non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, and cardiovascular death, with the use of testosterone compared to non-use. Some studies, but not all, have reported an increased risk of MACE in association with use of testosterone replacement therapy in men.

Patients should be informed of this possible risk when deciding whether to use or to continue to use testosterone gel, 1.62%.

5.6 Abuse of Testosterone and Monitoring of Serum Testosterone Concentrations

Testosterone has been subject to abuse, typically at doses higher than recommended for the approved indication and in combination with other anabolic androgenic steroids. Anabolic androgenic steroid abuse can lead to serious cardiovascular and psychiatric adverse reactions [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)].

If testosterone abuse is suspected, check serum testosterone concentrations to ensure they are within therapeutic range. However, testosterone levels may be in the normal or subnormal range in men abusing synthetic testosterone derivatives. Counsel patients concerning the serious adverse reactions associated with abuse of testosterone and anabolic androgenic steroids. Conversely, consider the possibility of testosterone and anabolic androgenic steroid abuse in suspected patients who present with serious cardiovascular or psychiatric adverse events.

5.7 Use in Women

Due to the lack of controlled evaluations in women and potential virilizing effects, testosterone gel, 1.62% is not indicated for use in women [see Contraindications (4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.2)].

5.8 Potential for Adverse Effects on Spermatogenesis

With large doses of exogenous androgens, including testosterone gel, 1.62%, spermatogenesis may be suppressed through feedback inhibition of pituitary FSH possibly leading to adverse effects on semen parameters including sperm count.

### Standards of care for the health of transgender and gender diverse people, version 8 [^024cdd70]. International Journal of Transgender Health (2022). High credibility.

Hormone therapy — indications, safety, and monitoring: Transgender and gender diverse (TGD) persons may require medically necessary gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) to achieve changes consistent with their embodied goals, gender identity, or both, and when provided under medical supervision, GAHT in adults is safe, though there are some potential long-term risks and careful monitoring and screening are required to reduce adverse events. In general, the goal is to target serum levels of the sex steroids to match the levels associated with the individual's gender identity, although optimal target ranges have not been established, and health care professionals can use serum testosterone and/or estradiol levels to monitor most sex steroid treatments; however, conjugated estrogens or synthetic estrogen use cannot be monitored. For estrogen therapy, monitoring of the estrone to estradiol ratio is not supported by the current published evidence, previously used conjugated estrogens have been abandoned in favor of bioidentical estrogens, and no randomized controlled trials have taken place in postmenopausal women or in transgender people undergoing estrogen treatment.

### Testosterone replacement therapy for male hypogonadism [^f746deaa]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Testosterone deficiency, or male hypogonadism, is a clinical syndrome that can be defined as persistently low serum testosterone levels in the setting of symptoms consistent with testosterone deficiency. Studies suggest that testosterone replacement therapy may improve sexual function, depressive symptoms, bone density, and lean body mass. Evidence is conflicting regarding its effect on cardiovascular events and mortality. Although prior studies suggested that testosterone replacement therapy increased the risk of cardiovascular disease, a large, randomized trial showed that it does not increase the risk of myocardial infarction or stroke, even in patients at high risk. After a detailed discussion of the potential benefits and risks through shared decision-making, testosterone replacement therapy should be considered for men with testosterone deficiency to correct selected symptoms and induce and maintain secondary sex characteristics. Treatment method should take into consideration patient preference, pharmacokinetics, potential for medication interactions, formulation-specific adverse effects, treatment burden, and cost. Clinicians should monitor men receiving testosterone replacement therapy for symptom improvement, potential adverse effects, and adherence. Serum testosterone, hematocrit, and prostate-specific antigen levels should be measured at baseline and at least annually in men 40 years or older receiving testosterone replacement therapy.

Patients using testosterone should seek medical attention immediately if symptoms of a heart attack or stroke are present, such as:

- Chest pain
- Shortness of breath or trouble breathing
- Weakness in one part or one side of the body
- Slurred speech A list of FDA-approved testosterone products can be found by searching for "testosterone" at Drugs@FDA. We urge health care professionals and patients to report side effects involving testosterone products to the FDA MedWatch program, using the information in the "Contact FDA" box at the bottom of the page.
- Heart attacks and strokes have been reported with testosterone treatment. Seek medical attention right away if you have symptoms of a heart attack or stroke, such as:

- Chest pain
- Shortness of breath or trouble breathing
- Weakness in one part or one side of the body
- Slurred speech
- Read the patient Medication Guide or patient information leaflet you get along with your prescription testosterone product.

These materials explain the benefits and risks associated with testosterone use. Data Summary FDA reviewed five observational studies 4–8 and two meta-analyses of placebo-controlled trials 9, 10 to examine the risk of cardiovascular events associated with testosterone replacement therapy. The five observational studies were retrospective cohort studies that reported conflicting results. Two of these studies found statistically significant cardiovascular harm with TRT, 4–5 two studies found a statistically significant mortality benefit with TRT, 6–7 and one study was inconclusive.
8. 8 The Xu meta-analysis involved 27 published, randomized, placebo-controlled trials representing 2, 994 mostly middle-aged and older male participants who reported 180 cardiovascular-related adverse events.

9 This study found that testosterone therapy was associated with an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events; however, methodological issues limit conclusions. These limitations include inconsistent and incomplete reporting of adverse events; substantial clinical heterogeneity in the design and conduct of the component trials and the types of cardiovascular outcomes included in the analyses; potential bias resulting from selection of component trials; and variable quality of the trials, particularly with regard to ascertainment of cardiovascular safety outcomes and balance in cardiovascular risk factors and discontinuation rates across study arms.

### Testosterone effects on the breast: implications for testosterone therapy for women [^f6f7cd18]. Endocrine Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Androgens have important physiological effects in women. Postmenopausal androgen replacement, most commonly as testosterone therapy, is becoming increasingly widespread. This is despite the lack of clear guidelines regarding the diagnosis of androgen insufficiency, optimal therapeutic doses, and long-term safety data. With respect to the breast specifically, there is the potential for exogenous testosterone to exert either androgenic or indirect estrogenic actions, with the latter potentially increasing breast cancer risk. In experimental studies, androgens exhibit growth-inhibitory and apoptotic effects in some, but not all, breast cancer cell lines. Differing effects between cell lines appear to be due primarily to variations in concentrations of specific coregulatory proteins at the receptor level. In rodent breast cancer models, androgen action is antiproliferative and proapoptotic, and is mediated via the androgen receptor, despite the potential for testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone to be aromatized to estrogen. The results from studies in rhesus monkeys suggest that testosterone may serve as a natural endogenous protector of the breast and limit mitogenic and cancer-promoting effects of estrogen on mammary epithelium. Epidemiological studies have significant methodological limitations and provide inconclusive results. The strongest data for exogenous testosterone therapy comes from primate studies. Based on such simulations, inclusion of testosterone in postmenopausal estrogen-progestin regimens has the potential to ameliorate the stimulating effects of combined estrogen-progestin on the breast. Research addressing this is warranted; however, the number of women that would be required for an adequately powered randomized controlled trial renders such a study unlikely.

### Should dehydroepiandrosterone Be administered to women? [^92748cba]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Context

Androgen prohormones such as dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) increase in early puberty, peak in the second and third decade, and thereafter decline, independent of menopausal status. Investigators have examined their potential beneficial effects in normal women and those with DHEA-deficient states.

Evidence Acquisition

A review of the literature from 1985 to 2021 on the potential benefits and risks of androgen prohormones in women.

Evidence Synthesis

Studies have examined the potential benefit of DHEA therapy for anti-aging, sexual dysfunction, infertility, metabolic bone health, cognition, and wellbeing in hormone-deficient states such as primary adrenal insufficiency, hypopituitarism, and anorexia as well as administration to normal women across the lifespan.

Conclusions

Data support small benefits in quality of life and mood but not for anxiety or sexual function in women with primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency or anorexia. No consistent beneficial effects of DHEA administration have been observed for menopausal symptoms, sexual function, cognition, or overall wellbeing in normal women. Local administration of DHEA shows benefit in vulvovaginal atrophy. Use of DHEA to improve induction of ovulation response in women with diminished ovarian reserve is not recommended. Risks of high physiologic or pharmacologic use of DHEA include androgenic and estrogenic side effects which are of concern for long-term administration.

Clinical Case

A 49-year-old woman with Addison's disease who is on low dose estrogen with cyclic progesterone therapy for menopausal symptoms returns for follow-up. She is on a stable glucocorticoid replacement strategy of hydrocortisone 10 mg in the morning and 5 mg in the early afternoon and fludrocortisone 0.05 mg each morning. She has read on the internet that additional therapy with DHEA may help her overall quality of life and libido. She asks whether she should add this therapy to her regimen and at what dose.

### Androgen therapy in women: a reappraisal: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^40a1e269]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Medium credibility.

Testosterone therapy for women with hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) — We suggest a 3- to 6-month trial of a dose of testosterone (T) for postmenopausal women requesting therapy for properly diagnosed HSDD that results in a midnormal premenopausal value in a reference assay to avoid pharmacological T administration (2|⊕⊕OO). If T therapy is prescribed, we suggest measuring T levels at baseline and after 3–6 weeks of initial treatment to assess patient overuse (2|⊕⊕OO), and in cases of ongoing T therapy, we suggest reviewing T levels every 6 months to monitor for excessive use and signs of androgen excess (2|⊕⊕OO). We suggest cessation of T therapy for women who have not responded to treatment by 6 months (2|⊕⊕OO), and no safety and efficacy data for T therapy are available after 24 months. Important considerations for implementation include that the response to therapy does not correlate with T levels; symptoms often recur after discontinuation and sexual dysfunction often requires long-term treatment; physiological T preparations for clinical use in women are not available in many countries, including the United States, and long-term safety data are lacking; and the criteria for the definition of disordered desire have changed from that used in clinical trials, which could impact response in individual patients.

### Standards of care for the health of transgender and gender diverse people, version 8 [^ce1f069f]. International Journal of Transgender Health (2022). High credibility.

Gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) — safety, targets, and monitoring: Transgender and gender diverse persons may require medically necessary GAHT to achieve changes consistent with their embodiment goals, gender identity, or both; when provided under medical supervision, GAHT in adults is safe, yet there are potential long-term risks and careful monitoring and screening are required to reduce adverse events.

The assumption that the estrone/estradiol ratio should be monitored is not supported by current evidence, including a European cohort of 212 adult transgender women during a 1-year follow-up showing no relationship between estrone concentration and change in body fat or breast development and that higher estrone concentrations or higher estrone/estradiol ratios are not associated with antagonistic effects on feminization; thus, monitoring of the estrone to estradiol ratio is not supported by the current published evidence.

### Testosterone therapy for reduced libido in women [^810477de]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Modest benefit has been shown from transdermal testosterone therapy given to postmenopausal women with reduced sexual desire. An increased frequency of satisfying sexual encounters and intensity of sexual desire and response has been shown in medically and psychiatrically healthy women able to have 2–3 satisfying sexual experiences each month before therapy commences. Women more clearly sexually dysfunctional in keeping with currently proposed definitions of sexual disorder have not been studied. Numerous factors are known to influence women's sexual desire with mood and feelings towards the partner showing the most robust associations. How to identify women whose low desire might stem from low testosterone activity remains unknown: neither serum levels of testosterone nor its metabolites correlate with desire or function. Production of androgens in the brain, sensitivity of the androgen receptors, and activity of cofactors are all potentially relevant confounds. The long-term safety of systemic testosterone with or without estrogen is unknown but necessary as women's sexual lives tend to endure as long as there is an active partner.

Monitoring

Total testosterone levels should be measured before initiating therapy to exclude women with midrange to high baseline testosterone concentrations. SHBG should also be measured as women with levels greater than the normal range are less likely to benefit from therapy. High SHBG can be seen in healthy women but is also associated with the use of oral estrogens, including estrogen-containing hormonal contraceptives, thyroid replacement, and untreated hyperthyroidism. In women with high SHBG with unmodifiable factors (e.g. essential thyroid replacement), a trial of testosterone therapy is still worthwhile.

Total testosterone levels should be assessed 3–6 weeks after initiating therapy to enable titration and ensure the patient is not applying an excessive dose. If the dose is increased, based on clinical response and blood level, total testosterone should be repeated within 6 weeks. Different preparations will have different absorption rates and hence different pharmacokinetics that determine when the peak blood level is achieved. As this is unknown for most products in women, the goal of testing blood levels is to prevent excessive dosing but not to treat to a target blood level of testosterone. Clinicians should ensure that the total testosterone does not significantly exceed the upper limit of the reference range for normal premenopausal women indicated by the patient's laboratory. When testosterone levels are maintained in the premenopausal range, androgenic side effects are rare. At supraphysiological levels testosterone can cause acne, hirsutism, deepening of the voice, and androgenic alopecia. Based on available safety data, if the level is supraphysiological, even in the absence of androgenic side effects, the patient should be instructed to titrate down the dose with a repeat blood test after 2–3 weeks. Serum testosterone concentrations should be monitored every 4–6 months once stable levels are achieved to screen for overuse with the inherent downstream androgenic consequences.

### Estrogen and androgen hormone therapy and well-being in surgically postmenopausal women [^027f3dce]. Journal of Women's Health (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Women undergoing surgical menopause experience an abrupt drop in gonadal hormones and are more likely to have symptoms that negatively impact well-being, including hot flashes, sexual dysfunction, psychological problems, and testosterone deficiency. The purpose of this review was to examine the effects of hormone therapies on well-being among surgically menopausal women.

Methods

Studies were retrieved using both Cochrane and PubMed searches. A systematic literature review was performed to identify double-blind randomized controlled trials of the effects of menopausal hormone therapies on quality of life and well-being among women who have undergone hysterectomy with bilateral oophorectomy. Two studies meeting these criteria were included for review.

Results

For each study reviewed, the following aspects were examined: type of hormonal therapies used, inclusion/exclusion criteria, overall changes, and changes in specific parameters of well-being. General well-being improved from baseline with certain types and doses of estrogen or estrogen plus testosterone therapy, with no serious adverse events.

Conclusions

Estrogen with or without testosterone may improve general well-being in some groups of surgically menopausal women. Levels of serum estrogen achieved in these studies were within a normal range for premenopausal women. Adding testosterone to estrogen therapy may provide additional improvements in well-being in some women, but only at supraphysiological levels of total testosterone and physiological levels of free testosterone. It is recommended that the clinician discuss the potential benefits and risks with each woman and devise an individualized plan based on shared decision making.

If a woman does not experience clinically meaningful improvement, treatment should not be continued beyond 6 months, and other causes for the symptoms should be reinvestigated. In women not responding to testosterone therapy, measurement of 5α-reductase could be considered, as some experts propose that women with reduced 5α-reductase activity may not respond to physiologic doses of transdermal testosterone. If testosterone therapy results in improvement of HSDD, the expert panel recommended that the woman continue for 6–12 months and then consider taking a drug holiday to see if treatment is still required. Furthermore, the panel concluded that although there is a lack of long-term safety data, ongoing testosterone therapy may be needed to maintain the improvement in HSDD.

### A sex-specific dose-response curve for testosterone: could excessive testosterone limit sexual interaction in women? [^091fe329]. Menopause (2017). Low credibility.

Testosterone treatment increases sexual desire and well-being in women with hypoactive sexual desire disorder; however, many studies have shown only modest benefits limited to moderate doses. Unlike men, available data indicate women show a bell-shaped dose-response curve for testosterone, wherein a threshold dosage of testosterone leads to desirable sexual function effects, but exceeding this threshold results in a lack of further positive sexual effects or may have a negative impact. Emotional and physical side-effects of excess testosterone, including aggression and virilization, may counteract the modest benefits on sexual interaction, providing a possible explanation for a threshold dose of testosterone in women. In this commentary, we will review and critically analyze data supporting a curvilinear dose-response relationship between testosterone treatment and sexual activity in women with low libido, and also explore possible explanations for this observed relationship. Understanding optimal dosing of testosterone unique to women may bring us one step closer to overcoming regulatory barriers in treating female sexual dysfunction.

Long-term safety

One 4-year open-label extension of 2 6-month clinical trials of 300 mcg/day transdermal testosterone patch in 967 women with oophorectomy treated with concomitant estrogen therapy showed no increase in the rate of serious adverse events. A phase 3 cardiovascular and breast safety RCT of 1% testosterone transdermal gel, 300 mcg daily was undertaken in 2008 and enrolled 3,656 postmenopausal participants older than 50 years, with at least 2 cardiovascular risk factors at baseline (e.g. hypertension, dyslipidemia) and a clinical diagnosis of HSDD. The composite cardiovascular end point included death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, coronary revascularization, hospitalized unstable angina, and venous thromboembolic events. After 4 years, with more than 7,300 women-years of exposure, the company (BioSante Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) reported 53 adjudicated cardiovascular events, a lower than anticipated rate, with the number of breast cancers as anticipated based on subject ages. Study results have been published in press releases but not in peer-reviewed publications. Despite these reassuring outcomes, long-term (beyond 2 years) safety data, particularly regarding breast cancer and cardiovascular events (acute myocardial infarction, stroke, deep vein thrombosis, and death), are limited and inconclusive.,

Future strategies to assess safety

Several recent meta-analyses and the 4-year open-label extension trial provide safety reassurance for the use of transdermal testosterone therapy in postmenopausal women with doses that approximate physiological levels for premenopausal women. However, reported RCTs to date have neither been large enough nor long enough to definitively determine the effects of testosterone therapy on safety outcomes of interest: cardiovascular events, breast cancer risk, endometrial and ovarian effects, cognitive health, mood, and musculoskeletal health.

One interim approach would be to establish longitudinal observational studies and patient registries to supplement completed RCTs. It would be clinically useful to stratify safety data by menopausal status, ovarian status (intact vs oophorectomized), and concurrent estrogen and progestogen therapies. As with studies of estrogen and progestin therapies, reassurances of safety would be strengthened with stratification of cardiovascular outcomes (venous thromboembolic events, stroke, myocardial infarction), by age, time since menopause, and metabolic characteristics to facilitate advising women at different baseline risk.

Purpose Of Review

Recently in October 2019 a Global Consensus Position on the use of Testosterone Therapy for Women was published. The use of testosterone and other agents for female sexual dysfunction (FSD) is an important topic for the urologist focusing on sexual health. This review describes the known causes for FSD, and discusses the role of androgens in this disorder, the evidence for using testosterone treatment, and other current and emerging therapies.

Recent Findings

A recent meta-analysis, published in The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology evaluated a total of 36 randomized control trials spanning 1990–2018 and includes a total of 8480 patients. The primary findings were that testosterone therapy (TTh) increased sexual function including satisfactory sexual event frequency, sexual desire, pleasure, arousal, orgasm, responsiveness, and self-image when compared with either a placebo or drug-control (e.g., estrogen ± progestogen). In addition, TTh reduced sexual concerns and distress in postmenopausal women. Side effects included an increase in weight, acne, and hair growth, but there was no increase in serious adverse events. Importantly, TTh duration was greater than 12 weeks in all randomized control trials included in this meta-analysis.

Summary

TTh is effective to treat FSD in postmenopausal women. More data is required to evaluate the long-term safety data on the effects of TTh on cardiovascular health, breast health, cognitive function, and the musculoskeletal system in women.

### The effect of statins on testosterone in men and women, a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^247132fd]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

This meta-analysis shows that statins reduce testosterone. This finding does not demonstrate that androgens mediate any health effect of statins, but raises the question as to whether testosterone modulation plays a role in statins' effects on health, particularly among men where testosterone is an important hormone. Whether reducing testosterone enhances or impairs the protective effects of statins on cardiovascular mortality needs to be determined urgently, because it could enable the development of enhanced statin based treatments, the development of other drugs in the same class and the identification of potentially modifiable population-wide risk factors for several non-communicable chronic diseases.

Exposure of a female fetus to androgens may result in varying degrees of virilization. In animal development studies, exposure to testosterone in utero resulted in hormonal and behavioral changes in offspring and structural impairments of reproductive tissues in female and male offspring. These studies did not meet current standards for nonclinical development toxicity studies.

Data

Animal Data

In developmental studies conducted in rats, rabbits, pigs, sheep, and rhesus monkeys, pregnant animals received intramuscular injection of testosterone during the period of organogenesis. Testosterone treatment at doses that were comparable to those used for testosterone replacement therapy resulted in structural impairments in both female and male offspring. Structural impairments observed in females included increased anogenital distance, phallus development, empty scrotum, no external vagina, intrauterine growth retardation, reduced ovarian reserve, and increased ovarian follicular recruitment. Structural impairments seen in male offspring included increased testicular weight, larger seminal tubular lumen diameter, and higher frequency of occluded tubule lumen. Increased pituitary weight was seen in both sexes.

Testosterone exposure in utero also resulted in hormonal and behavioral changes in offspring. Hypertension was observed in pregnant female rats and their offspring exposed to doses approximately twice those used for testosterone replacement therapy.

Risk Summary

TESTIM is not indicated for use in females.

8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential

Infertility

During treatment with large doses of exogenous androgens, including TESTIM, spermatogenesis may be suppressed through feedback inhibition of the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)], possible leading to adverse effects on semen parameters including sperm count. Reduced fertility is observed in some men taking testosterone replacement therapy. Testicular atrophy, subfertility, and infertility have also been reported in men who abuse anabolic androgenic steroids [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.2)]. With either type of use, the impact on fertility may be irreversible.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of TESTIM in pediatric patients less than 18 years old have not been established. Improper use may result in acceleration of bone age and premature closure of epiphyses.

8.5 Geriatric Use

There is insufficient long-term safety data in geriatric patients to assess the potentially increased risks of cardiovascular disease and prostate cancer [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

### Evaluation and management of testosterone deficiency: AUA guideline [^594eed6e]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Medium credibility.

AUA nomenclature for statement type — Strong Recommendation is defined across evidence levels as follows: For Evidence Strength A (High Certainty), decisions reflect "Benefits > Risks/Burdens (or vice versa)" with "Net benefit (or net harm) is substantial", and they "Applies to most patients in most circumstances and future research is unlikely to change confidence". For Evidence Strength B (Moderate Certainty), "Net benefit (or net harm) is substantial" and it "Applies to most patients in most circumstances but better evidence could change confidence". For Evidence Strength C (Low Certainty), "Net benefit (or net harm) appears substantial", it "Applies to most patients in most circumstances but better evidence is likely to change confidence", and it is "rarely used to support a Strong Recommendation".

### Testosterone treatment in adult men with age-related low testosterone: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^ff090b08]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Testosterone treatment in adult men with age-related low testosterone — cardiovascular events, serious adverse events, and mortality show low-certainty evidence of a small increase to no difference in adverse cardiovascular events (Peto odds ratio, 1.22 [CI, 0.66 to 2.23]) and moderate-certainty evidence of no increased risk for serious adverse events (Peto odds ratio, 0.73 [CI, 0.46 to 1.17]); pooled analysis of 12 studies found fewer deaths with testosterone than placebo (incidence, 0.4% [CI, 0.07% to 0.99%] vs. 1.5% [CI, 0.48% to 2.89%]; Peto odds ratio, 0.47 [CI, 0.25 to 0.89]), but the evidence review graded this evidence as low certainty and the CCG felt that it had insufficient evidence to make conclusions about mortality.

### Endocrine aspects of female sexual dysfunction [^9e59d1e7]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Introduction

Various endogenous hormones, including estrogen, testosterone, progesterone and prolactin, may influence female sexual function.

Aim

To provide recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of women with endocrinologic sexual difficulties.

Methods

The Endocrine Aspects of Female Sexual Dysfunction Committee was part of a multidisciplinary International Consultation. It included four experts from two countries and several peer reviewers.

Main Outcome Measure

Expert opinion was based on committee discussion, a comprehensive literature review and evidence-based grading of available publications.

Results

The impact of hormones on female sexual function and their etiological roles in dysfunction is complex. Research data are limited as studies have been hampered by lack of precise hormonal assays and validated measures of sexual function in women. Sex steroid insufficiency is associated with urogenital atrophy and may also adversely affect central sexual thought processes. Systemic estrogen/estrogen progestin therapy alleviates climacteric symptoms but there is no evidence that this therapy specifically improves hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) in premenopausal or postmenopausal women. Exogenous testosterone has been shown in small randomized controlled trials (RCT) to improve sexual desire, arousal and sexual satisfaction in both premenopausal and postmenopausal women. However, as there is no biochemical measure that clearly identifies who to treat, use of exogenous testosterone should be considered only after other causes of HSDD have been excluded, such as depression, relationship problems and ill health. The clinical assessment of HSDD should include detailed medical, gynecologic, sexual and psychosocial history and physical examination including the external/internal genitalia. Hormonal therapy should be individualized and risks/benefits fully discussed, and all treated women should be carefully followed up and monitored for therapeutic side effects.

Conclusions

There is a need for prospective, multi-institutional clinical trials to define safe and effective endocrine treatments for female sexual dysfunction.

### Testosterone treatment and the risk of prostate adverse events [^cd2368a8]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Hypogonadism is a common clinical condition affecting men, with older men having an increased incidence. Clinicians (endocrinologists and urologists) who may be involved in providing testosterone therapy should be familiar with the effects of testosterone on the prostate. Before initiating testosterone therapy, physicians and patients should partake in shared decision-making, including pretreatment testing, risks and benefits of testosterone therapy relating to benign prostatic hyperplasia and lower urinary tract symptoms, a discussion on prostate cancer in those who have not been diagnosed with malignancy, and a thorough discussion with patients who may have a previous diagnosis of prostate cancer.
