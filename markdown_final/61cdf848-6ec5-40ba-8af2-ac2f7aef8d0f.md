## Question

Causes of diarrhea in hives

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the causes of diarrhea in patients with hives (urticaria). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the urticaria is acute versus chronic and whether the diarrhea could reflect a multisystem process like anaphylaxis or mast cell activation. Then, I should verify gastrointestinal mast cell mediator mechanisms that link urticaria and diarrhea. Next, I will review common etiologies including IgE-mediated food allergy, alpha-gal syndrome, drug-induced urticaria with diarrhea, and infections. After that, I need to check less common causes such as urticarial vasculitis, hereditary angioedema, and celiac disease. Finally, I should consider medications used to treat urticaria that may themselves cause diarrhea, and then synthesize a prioritized differential and management implications with references to guidelines and high-quality sources [^1169Smu6] [^114DVX6w] [^11544rd7].

> Let me first confirm the clinical context. Hives (urticaria) are typically mast cell–driven, evanescent pruritic wheals, and when gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea accompany urticaria, I should immediately consider whether this represents a multisystem allergic process, potentially anaphylaxis or mast cell activation, because guidelines explicitly list gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) as part of anaphylaxis criteria when they occur with skin findings or other organ involvement [^111SXRNh] [^117LeDww]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) can also include systemic complaints, and about a quarter of CSU patients report gastrointestinal symptoms, which may reflect concurrent mast cell activation rather than frank anaphylaxis, so I need to distinguish severity and tempo of onset to guide urgency and epinephrine decisions [^112Yp8oj] [^117LeDww].

> I will now examine the core pathophysiology. Urticaria results from mast cell degranulation with histamine and other mediators causing vasodilation and increased vascular permeability; the same mediators can increase intestinal motility and secretion, producing diarrhea, so concurrent urticaria and diarrhea can share a mast cell–mediated mechanism even outside of full anaphylaxis, which is why mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) and systemic mastocytosis frequently present with both cutaneous and gastrointestinal symptoms including urticaria and diarrhea [^112xXbHJ] [^11336oop] [^11544rd7]. Wait, let me verify the mediator link — histamine, prostaglandins, and leukotrienes released from mast cells can directly alter gut transit and secretion, supporting a mechanistic bridge between hives and diarrhea in the same patient [^117G7Tk3].

> Next, I should review IgE-mediated food allergy as a leading cause of acute urticaria with diarrhea. Immediate-type reactions typically occur within minutes to 2 hours of ingestion and often involve multiple organ systems, with skin (urticaria, angioedema) and gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) being common, so a careful, time-linked dietary history is essential to identify culprit foods such as nuts, shellfish, milk, egg, soy, wheat, fish, and sesame [^115dx2ez] [^112MBa7t]. Hold on, I should verify that the history aligns with an IgE mechanism — recurrent reproducibility, consistent timing, and multisystem features strengthen the case for food-triggered urticaria with diarrhea [^111jMVZ9].

> But wait, what if the reaction is delayed by several hours and linked to mammalian meat or dairy? Alpha-gal syndrome (AGS) from IgE to galactose-α-1,3-galactose can cause urticaria, angioedema, and gastrointestinal symptoms including diarrhea, typically 2–6 hours after exposure to mammalian products; importantly, some patients have isolated gastrointestinal symptoms without skin findings, so I should consider AGS even when hives are absent or intermittent, especially in patients with tick exposures or living in endemic regions [^114bP2XT] [^117TCcGi] [^112XtKbx]. I should double-check the epidemiology and testing — serum alpha-gal IgE is the appropriate test when AGS is suspected based on geography, exposure, and clinical pattern, and GI-only phenotypes are well described [^115J2uyi] [^112XtKbx].

> I need to check for drug-induced urticaria with diarrhea, because new medications started within days to weeks of symptom onset are a classic trigger of acute urticaria and some agents also cause diarrhea. Antibiotics such as amoxicillin-clavulanate commonly cause urticaria and diarrhea, and many antibiotics carry risks of C. difficile–associated diarrhea; macrolides like azithromycin and agents like rifabutin can also cause diarrhea and hypersensitivity with urticaria, so a meticulous medication timeline is critical [^117TkVxz] [^113BKjaj] [^112hh4F1]. Hmm, wait a minute — topical agents can also matter; mupirocin ointment has been associated with hives and C. difficile–associated diarrhea, reminding me to ask about seemingly innocuous topicals and antiseptics as well [^1126oDjX] [^116zTttw].

> Let me consider infections next, especially in acute urticaria. Viral infections are a leading cause of acute urticaria in children and can be accompanied by gastrointestinal symptoms; COVID-19 has been reported with urticaria as an initial presentation, and norovirus causes prominent vomiting and diarrhea that may temporally coincide with hives in some cases, so I should correlate timing with systemic viral symptoms and exposures [^1169Smu6] [^115kUkEV] [^111K6eJC]. Hold on, I should verify that I'm not overcalling infection — most acute urticaria is self-limited, but when diarrhea is present, I need to ensure hydration status and evaluate for infectious gastroenteritis if red flags or high-risk features exist [^1169Smu6] [^111K6eJC].

> I will now examine systemic mastocytosis and mast cell activation disorders. Patients with indolent or advanced systemic mastocytosis frequently report flushing, pruritus, hives, and gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, and nausea, reflecting clonal mast cell burden and mediator release; NCCN guidance emphasizes recognizing clusters of mast cell activation symptoms across organ systems and supports a high index of suspicion when urticaria coexists with diarrhea and other systemic features [^11544rd7] [^115CzxmU]. Let me reconsider the diagnostic approach — if MCAS or SM is suspected, I should confirm with appropriate mediator testing and, when indicated, bone marrow evaluation, because the therapeutic implications differ from simple urticaria [^11336oop] [^11544rd7].

> Next, I should review urticarial vasculitis, which can mimic chronic urticaria but often burns rather than itches and leaves hyperpigmentation; although diarrhea is not a defining feature, systemic inflammation can involve the gut, and patients may have systemic symptoms. Biopsy demonstrating leukocytoclastic vasculitis and complement studies (C3, C4, C1q) help distinguish urticarial vasculitis, and management requires anti-inflammatory strategies beyond antihistamines [^116D2sDb]. Wait, let me verify that I'm not conflating entities — true urticaria lesions are evanescent and nonpurpuric, so persistence, pain, or bruising should prompt biopsy consideration to exclude vasculitis [^116D2sDb].

> I should confirm that hereditary angioedema (HAE) is on the differential when diarrhea accompanies angioedema, even though HAE typically lacks urticaria. Recurrent abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea with transient bowel wall edema and even ascites can occur during HAE attacks, and these episodes are often misattributed to other GI causes; a history of recurrent cutaneous angioedema without hives and poor response to antihistamines should trigger evaluation for HAE with C1 inhibitor and complement studies [^1173vdMQ]. Hold on, I should verify that C4 is typically low during attacks and that bradykinin-mediated disease explains the antihistamine resistance, guiding toward specific HAE therapies if confirmed [^1173vdMQ].

> Let me think about celiac disease as a potential contributor. Dermatitis herpetiformis can present with urticaria-like lesions and is associated with gluten-sensitive enteropathy; while chronic diarrhea and malabsorption are classic, some patients have minimal GI symptoms, so new-onset urticaria with diarrhea warrants serologic testing for celiac disease and, if positive, appropriate endoscopic confirmation and dietary management, given the systemic implications of untreated celiac disease [^1124SseR]. I should double-check that direct immunofluorescence improves diagnostic yield for dermatitis herpetiformis when the clinical picture is suggestive but histology is nondiagnostic [^1124SseR].

> Next, I should review treatment-related causes of diarrhea in patients who already have urticaria. Omalizumab, a mainstay for refractory CSU, has diarrhea listed among adverse effects in clinical trials, though rates are low and generally comparable to placebo; still, if diarrhea began after omalizumab initiation, temporal correlation should be considered in the differential and discussed with the patient [^112dBGY1]. I need to ensure I also screen for other new drugs started for comorbidities that could cause diarrhea, since polypharmacy is common in chronic urticaria care [^1172mi2J].

> But wait, what about histamine intolerance as a non–IgE-mediated mechanism contributing to both urticaria and diarrhea? Reduced diamine oxidase activity and high dietary histamine load can provoke symptoms mimicking allergy, including urticaria and diarrhea; while controversial, this may be relevant in select patients with reproducible food-related symptoms and negative conventional allergy testing, prompting a cautious, structured dietary trial and symptom tracking rather than broad restriction diets [^113bNuMK]. Hold on, I should verify that evidence quality is limited and counsel patients accordingly to avoid unnecessary dietary limitations [^113bNuMK].

> Let me synthesize the differential to guide testing and management. Most likely etiologies in a patient with urticaria and diarrhea include IgE-mediated food allergy, alpha-gal syndrome, drug-induced urticaria with concurrent medication-related diarrhea, viral infection triggering acute urticaria, and mast cell activation syndromes including systemic mastocytosis; less common but important considerations include urticarial vasculitis, hereditary angioedema, and celiac disease with dermatitis herpetiformis. Priority should be guided by timing, associated symptoms, exposures, and response to antihistamines, with targeted labs such as serum tryptase, complement studies, alpha-gal IgE, celiac serologies, and, when indicated, biopsy to distinguish urticaria from vasculitis or dermatitis herpetiformis [^115dx2ez] [^115J2uyi] [^116D2sDb] [^1124SseR] [^11336oop] [^1173vdMQ]. I should confirm that initial urticaria workups remain focused, reserving extensive testing for atypical or refractory cases per guidelines, to avoid low-yield testing while catching high-stakes diagnoses early [^1172mi2J] [^111r7UA2].

> Finally, I need to ensure immediate safety. If urticaria coexists with diarrhea and any respiratory compromise, hypotension, or altered mentation, I should treat for anaphylaxis with intramuscular epinephrine without delay, because gastrointestinal symptoms count toward anaphylaxis criteria when combined with skin involvement; early recognition and epinephrine are lifesaving, and patients with suspected food triggers or recurrent systemic symptoms should carry epinephrine autoinjectors and have an action plan [^111SXRNh] [^117LeDww]. Hold on, I should verify that even patients with isolated urticaria who have potential anaphylaxis risk (e.g., food or stings) are advised to carry epinephrine pending full evaluation, which aligns with best practice [^117LeDww].

Diarrhea with hives most often reflects **mast cell activation** from IgE-mediated food or drug allergy [^115dx2ez] [^111SXRNh], or **systemic mastocytosis** [^11544rd7]. Less common causes include viral infections [^114Tcgx9], alpha-gal syndrome [^114bP2XT], and urticarial vasculitis [^116D2sDb]. Diarrhea arises from **histamine, prostaglandins, and leukotrienes** increasing intestinal motility and secretion [^117G7Tk3]; with hives, this indicates multi-organ involvement and should prompt evaluation for anaphylaxis or mast cell disease [^111SXRNh] [^11544rd7]. Management focuses on identifying triggers, treating acute reactions with epinephrine when indicated [^117LeDww], and using antihistamines, mast cell stabilizers, or biologics for chronic disease [^112dBGY1] [^114FxfLw].

## Pathophysiological mechanisms linking diarrhea and hives

Diarrhea and hives co-occur due to shared mast cell mediators that increase intestinal motility and secretion while causing dermal vasodilation and permeability [^117G7Tk3]. Key mediators include **histamine**, which increases intestinal motility and secretion while causing dermal vasodilation and permeability; **prostaglandins**, which stimulate secretion and motility; and **leukotrienes**, which enhance secretion and smooth muscle contraction. These mediators drive simultaneous gastrointestinal and cutaneous symptoms, explaining their frequent co-occurrence.

## Common causes of diarrhea in patients with hives

Several **clinical scenarios** commonly produce concurrent diarrhea and hives:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Mechanism** | **Examples** |
|-|-|-|
| IgE-mediated food allergy | Mast cell degranulation from IgE binding | - Shellfish <br/> - Nuts <br/> - Eggs <br/> - Milk <br/> - Alpha-gal syndrome [^115J2uyi] [^114bP2XT] |
| Drug-induced hypersensitivity | Immune-mediated mast cell activation | - Antibiotics (e.g. amoxicillin) [^117TkVxz] <br/> - NSAIDs <br/> - Chemotherapy agents [^113Uq18R] |
| Viral infections | Mast cell activation from viral triggers | - COVID-19 [^115kUkEV] <br/> - Norovirus [^notfound] |
| Systemic mastocytosis | Clonal mast cell proliferation and activation | - Indolent SM <br/> - Aggressive SM [^11544rd7] |
| Urticarial vasculitis | Immune complex–mediated inflammation | - Hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis [^116D2sDb] |

---

## Clinical significance of concurrent diarrhea and hives

Concurrent diarrhea and hives indicate **multi-organ mast cell activation** and should prompt evaluation for anaphylaxis or mast cell disease [^11336oop]. This pattern signals higher disease burden, poorer quality of life, and a need for aggressive therapy and specialist referral [^112Yp8oj].

---

## Diagnostic approach

A **structured approach** is essential:

- **History**: Onset, duration, triggers, associated symptoms, medication use, and family history [^1172mi2J].
- **Physical examination**: Skin lesions, angioedema, abdominal tenderness, and organomegaly [^115mUmpB].
- **Laboratory tests**: CBC, ESR/CRP, liver enzymes, TSH, tryptase, complement levels, and specific IgE testing as indicated [^1172mi2J].
- **Specialized tests**: Skin biopsy for urticarial vasculitis, bone marrow biopsy for mastocytosis, and oral food challenges for food allergy [^113cXFF7] [^112MBa7t].

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **underlying cause**:

- **Acute reactions**: Epinephrine for anaphylaxis, antihistamines, and corticosteroids [^117LeDww].
- **Chronic urticaria**: Second-generation antihistamines, omalizumab, and mast cell stabilizers [^113vBADL] [^112dBGY1].
- **Systemic mastocytosis**: Avoid triggers, antihistamines, mast cell stabilizers, and cytoreductive therapy for advanced disease [^113cXFF7].
- **Dietary management**: Elimination diets for food allergies and histamine intolerance [^113bNuMK].

---

## Conclusion

Diarrhea with hives reflects **mast cell mediator release** causing simultaneous gastrointestinal and cutaneous symptoms. This pattern signals significant disease burden and warrants a focused evaluation for allergies, infections, mast cell disorders, and vasculitis, with management tailored to the trigger and disease severity [^11336oop].

## References

### Management of urticaria: not too complicated, not too simple [^112dBGY1]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2015). Low credibility.

Key point: Consideration should be given to the thesis that patients suffering from CSU with no response to treatment at high doses of H 1 -antihistamines should be treated with omalizumab.

What is dosage of omalizumab is recommended for refractory CSU? Omalizumab dosage in CSU has been evaluated in three phase III clinical trials that assessed clinical endpoints such as pruritus control, the number of wheals, the UAS and UAS7 and episodes of angioedema. The recommended dose of omalizumab is 300 mg administered subcutaneously every 4 weeks, as this amount ensures maximum efficacy without serious safety concerns. Although other doses achieved statistical significance for the primary endpoints and most of the secondary endpoints, it was concluded that 300 mg provided the best benefit–risk profile for most adult patients, regardless of other variables, such as body mass index and IgE levels. Other retrospective, noncontrolled, observational studies also reported significant symptom control with different doses and scheme protocols. However, large randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials should be performed before these protocols could be recommended.

Key point: Omalizumab is recommended for use in refractory CSU at 300 mg administered subcutaneously every 4 weeks.

What side-effects are associated with omalizumab treatment in CSU? In randomized trials, side-effects reported in more that 3% of patients receiving consisted in headache, diarrhoea, joint pain, dysmenorrhoea and upper respiratory tract infections, without differences between the groups receiving active treatment and placebo.

Key point: Omalizumab given at 300 mg has a favourable safety profile.

When can treatment with omalizumab be discontinued or modified? In a phase III study, Kaplan et al. reported that after discontinuation of omalizumab, most patients recurred in a 10-week period. Interestingly, an acute rebound of hives was not observed, and reappearance of symptoms was slow. It has also been reported that retreatment is effective. In another study in which omalizumab was reintroduced in 20 (47.5%) patients because of recurrence of symptoms, control was achieved in 18 patients (90%), indicating a good retreatment rate with omalizumab.

Less Common Adverse Reactions

Defecation urgency, fecal incontinence, dyspepsia, and viral gastroenteritis were reported in less than 2% of patients in the LINZESS treatment group and at an incidence greater than in the placebo treatment group.

Functional Constipation (FC) in Pediatric Patients 6 to 17 Years of Age

The safety of LINZESS 72 mcg once daily was evaluated in pediatric patients 6 to 17 years of age with FC in a 12-week double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial (Trial 7) [see Clinical Studies (14.3)]. There were 164 patients per treatment group.

Diarrhea was the most common adverse reaction and was reported in 4% of LINZESS-treated patients compared to 2% of placebo-treated patients. One patient in the LINZESS-treated group reported severe diarrhea and discontinued treatment. No patient in the placebo-treated group discontinued treatment due to severe diarrhea. Most reported cases of diarrhea started within the first 2 weeks of LINZESS treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Other adverse reactions reported at a higher incidence in the LINZESS group than the placebo group included nausea (2 patients) and abdominal discomfort and dehydration (1 patient each).

6.2 Postmarketing Experience

The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of LINZESS. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Hypersensitivity reactions: Anaphylaxis, angioedema, rash (including hives or urticaria)

Gastrointestinal reactions: Hematochezia, nausea, rectal hemorrhage

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^111SXRNh]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

NASEMSO anaphylaxis — diagnostic features define anaphylaxis as "More severe and is characterized by an acute onset involving" either "The skin (urticaria) and/or mucosa with either respiratory compromise or decreased BP or signs of end-organ dysfunction" OR "Hypotension for that patient after exposure to a known allergen" with adult threshold "Adults: Systolic BP less than 90", OR "Two or more of the following occurring rapidly after exposure to a likely allergen": "Skin and/or mucosal involvement (urticaria, itchy, swollen tongue/lips)" — noting that "Skin involvement may be ABSENT in up to 40% of cases of anaphylaxis" — "Respiratory compromise (dyspnea, wheezing, stridor, hypoxemia)", "Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms (vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea)", or "Hypotension or associated symptoms (syncope, hypotonia, chest tightness, incontinence)". Non-anaphylactic allergic reaction is distinguished by "Signs involving only one organ system (e.g., localized angioedema that does not compromise the airway, or not associated with vomiting; hives alone)".

### Unusual purpuric eruption in a child [^116TtaSf]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

A 5-year-old, previously healthy girl presented with new-onset, persistent, red, burning hives covering large segments of her body. Associated symptoms included angioedema, shortness of breath, and diarrhea. The lesions resolved after 24 hours, leaving behind areas of bruising. On physical examination, the patient appeared well, with scattered, variably sized, purpuric patches and urticarial plaques on the torso and extremities (Fig 1, Fig 2, Fig 3). Laboratory evaluation revealed leukocytosis, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, normal C1q antibody levels, and decreased C4 levels. Two weeks after the initial presentation, she developed the same purpuric eruption accompanied by acute hypoxic respiratory failure.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Urticaria multiforme
B. Urticarial vasculitis (UV)
C. Erythema multiforme
D. Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) (IgA-mediated vasculitis)
E. Hereditary angioedema

### Pancrelipase (Zenpep) [^115mEkQ5]. FDA (2014). Low credibility.

6.2 Postmarketing Experience

Postmarketing data for ZENPEP have been available since 2009. The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Zenpep. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

The most commonly reported adverse events are gastrointestinal disorders (including abdominal distension, abdominal pain, diarrhea, flatulence, constipation and nausea) and skin disorders (including pruritus, urticaria, and rash).

In patients at risk for abnormal blood glucose levels glycemic control may be affected by administration of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy. Consideration should be given to additional glucose monitoring in these patients.

Delayed- and immediate-release pancreatic enzyme products with different formulations of the same active ingredient (pancrelipase) have been used for the treatment of patients with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency due to cystic fibrosis and other conditions, such as chronic pancreatitis. The long-term safety profile of these products has been described in the medical literature. The most serious adverse events include fibrosing colonopathy, distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (DIOS), recurrence of pre-existing carcinoma, and severe allergic reactions including anaphylaxis, asthma, hives, and pruritus.

In general, pancreatic enzyme products have a well defined and favorable risk-benefit profile in exocrine pancreatic insufficiency.

### Plecanatide (Trulance) [^114x9b6a]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Irritable Bowel Syndrome with Constipation (IBS-C)

The safety data described below reflect data from 1,449 adults patients with IBS-C randomized in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials (Study 3 and Study 4) to receive placebo or 3 mg TRULANCE once daily for 12 weeks.

Most Common Adverse Reactions

Table 2 provides the incidence of adverse reactions reported in at least 2% of IBS-C patients treated with TRULANCE and at an incidence that was greater than in the placebo group.

Diarrhea

The majority of reported cases of diarrhea occurred within 4 weeks of treatment initiation. Severe diarrhea was reported in 1% of TRULANCE-treated patients compared to 0.1% of placebo-treated patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Severe diarrhea was reported to occur within the first day of treatment.

Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation

Discontinuations due to adverse reactions occurred in 2.5% of TRULANCE-treated patients and 0.4% of placebo-treated patients. The most common adverse reaction leading to discontinuation was diarrhea: 1.2% of TRULANCE-treated patients and 0% of placebo-treated patients withdrew due to diarrhea.

Less Common Adverse Reactions

Adverse reactions reported in 1% or more but less than 2% of TRULANCE-treated patients and at an incidence greater than placebo were: nausea, nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, urinary tract infection, and dizziness. Two patients reported increased liver biochemical tests (alanine aminotransferase (ALT) greater than 5 to 15 times the upper limit of normal).

6.2 Postmarketing Experience

The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of TRULANCE. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to TRULANCE exposure.

### Racecadotril for acute diarrhoea in children [^116XHZX3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

The efficacy of racecadotril might be influenced by the severity of the disease, and children with more severe diarrhoea may have better response to treatment. Only two trials measured the severity of diarrhoea using a score system (Gharial 2017; Kang 2016a), and only Gharial 2017 applied it to the inclusion criteria. We roughly stratified participants into two level of severity based on being inpatients or outpatients. Future trials might use a score system to measure the severity of diarrhoea and investigate the impact of disease severity on the efficacy of racecadotril.

This review only included RCTs for safety assessment, but observational studies could also provide important data on safety, especially on reporting serious rare adverse events. Nucera 2006 reported a case of a 3‐year‐old child (weight: 20 kg) with generalized oedema, itching, and aphonia after a two‐day treatment with racecadotril. He recovered after discontinuation of racecadotril and treatment with methylprednisolone, hydroxyzine, and adrenaline. Moreno 2009 reported a 12‐year‐old boy who developed cephalic pruritus 10 minutes after administration of 100 mg of racecadotril. Simple‐blinded controlled oral challenge was conducted with increasing dose of racecadotril; 15 minutes later the child suffered a facialis erythema and a generalized urticaria, which illustrated that racecadotril is related to hypersensitivity. The small sample size and short duration of follow‐up within the included RCTs limits this review's ability to analyse adverse effects. Further reviews may consider including observational studies for safety assessment.

In applying the evidence to clinical practice, the types of patients should be considered. We only included children under five in the efficacy and safety assessment for a single clinical presentation, leading to a homogeneous data set. However, racecadotril is widely used in other age groups of children and adults. The results of this review might not be applicable to other age groups. In addition, racecadotril has been used for other causes of loose stools, such as in bacterial infectious diarrhoea, and diarrhoea secondary to other conditions like chemotherapy, HIV, malnutrition, etc. The results of this review may not be applicable to those groups of patients.

### Idarubicin hydrochloride (idamycin PFS) [^113Uq18R]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

Approximately 550 patients with AML have received idarubicin in combination with cytarabine in controlled clinical trials worldwide. In addition, over 550 patients with acute leukemia have been treated in uncontrolled trials utilizing idarubicin as a single agent or in combination. The table below lists the adverse experiences reported in U.S. Study 2 (see CLINICAL STUDIES) and is representative of the experiences in other studies. These adverse experiences constitute all reported or observed experiences, including those not considered to be drug related. Patients undergoing induction therapy for AML are seriously ill due to their disease, are receiving multiple transfusions, and concomitant medications including potentially toxic antibiotics and antifungal agents. The contribution of the study drug to the adverse experience profile is difficult to establish.

The duration of aplasia and incidence of mucositis were greater on the IDR arm than the DNR arm, especially during consolidation in some U.S. controlled trials (see CLINICAL STUDIES).

The following information reflects experience based on U.S. controlled clinical trials.

Myelosuppression

Severe myelosuppression is the major toxicity associated with idarubicin therapy, but this effect of the drug is required in order to eradicate the leukemic clone. During the period of myelosuppression, patients are at risk of developing infection and bleeding which may be life-threatening or fatal.

Gastrointestinal

Nausea and/or vomiting, mucositis, abdominal pain and diarrhea were reported frequently, but were severe (equivalent to WHO Grade 4) in less than 5% of patients. Severe enterocolitis with perforation has been reported rarely. The risk of perforation may be increased by instrumental intervention. The possibility of perforation should be considered in patients who develop severe abdominal pain and appropriate steps for diagnosis and management should be taken.

Dermatologic

Alopecia was reported frequently and dermatologic reactions including generalized rash, urticaria and a bullous erythrodermatous rash of the palms and soles have occurred. The dermatologic reactions were usually attributed to concomitant antibiotic therapy. Local reactions including hives at the injection site have been reported.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^116X2tMh]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute urticaria — testing recommendations and indications: Skin testing or laboratory evaluation for allergy to foods, food additives, or aeroallergens not supported by a specific history compatible with IgE-mediated pathogenesis has not been associated with improved outcomes of care and is not recommended. Because acute urticaria and angioedema will usually resolve spontaneously, laboratory evaluation for chronic illness not suggested by the clinical history or physical examination and elimination diets are not recommended, and extensive evaluation for specific viral pathogens (or antiviral therapy) is not indicated unless suggested by the clinical history. In contrast, skin testing or immunoassay to identify specific triggers for acute urticaria and angioedema can be helpful if an allergic cause is suggested based on the patient's history, and skin testing in this scenario would only be done after the resolution of acute hives with suppression of antihistamines or through serologic testing in the presence of significant dermatographism.

Chronic inducible urticaria (CIndU) is characterized by the appearance of hives (urticaria) and/or angioedema in response to specific triggers or stimuli. For accurate diagnosis, anamnesis-driven specific, and if available, standardized trigger testings, as well as patient reported outcomes, should be applied. The currently recommended treatment algorithm is the same as for chronic spontaneous urticaria but is largely off-label for CIndU. New, and possibly more disease-specific, treatment options are needed for CIndU patients, who are often severely impacted by their disease. Several clinical trials are currently ongoing.

### MASTering systemic mastocytosis: lessons learned from a large patient cohort [^113RPfBf]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

Identification of eligible patients with SM and their subtypes

In this retrospective cohort study, the electronic medical records (EMRs) of patients aged 18 years or older within the KPSC health system were used to identify patients with at least 1 International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision or 10th Revision code for SM (see the Appendix in the Online Repository at). Patients were manually confirmed as having SM by physician review of each individual medical record. The WHO 2016 criteria were used because at the time of initiation of this study, the WHO 2022 update had not yet been published. Patients with only partial or incomplete data were confirmed on the basis of the best available historical data. Three subjects were identified solely by bone marrow report, without a physician diagnosis (see Fig E1 in the Online Repository at).

SM subtyping

SM subtypes were determined on the basis of established criteria for subclassification (according to the 2016 WHO guidelines[Table I]).

Table I
Systemic mastocytosis subtypes based on 2016 WHO guidelines

Delay in SM diagnosis

The complete EMRs of all patients with confirmed SM were thoroughly reviewed, and the earliest time point of mast cell–related symptoms was determined. If symptoms were directly related to eventual SM diagnosis, the time at which the patient reported symptom initiation was utilized (and confirmed by EMRs, whenever possible). Symptoms included abdominal pain, allergic reaction, anaphylaxis, angioedema, diarrhea, hives, rash, and urticaria, and any "B" or "C" finding on laboratory test or imaging results. Delay in diagnosis was determined on the basis of time between the date of the initial presenting symptoms and the date of definitive diagnosis.

SM progression and all-cause mortality

Patients with confirmed SM were grouped by SM subtype (Table I), and the progression status and interval from ISM to advanced SM was determined. Time to progression was determined by calculating the interval in months between time of definitive diagnosis to time of first presentation of either 2 "B" findings, at least 1 "C" finding, or other evidence of either an associated hematologic malignancy or MCL. For both SM progression and mortality analyses, the end of follow-up date was the date of death, study end date (September 30, 2022), or date on which the patient was lost to follow-up (no longer enrolled at KPSC).

### Safety of gadoterate meglumine: a review of 35 Years of clinical use and more than 170 Million doses [^111q4Lv5]. Investigative Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

GBCAs in general have shown an excellent safety profile and favorable benefit/risk ratio with a low incidence of mild adverse events, rare cases of severe hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs), and infrequent episodes of neurotoxic reactions. Nausea is reported in approximately 1.5% of patients, hives in 0.2%, and severe reactions in less than 0.001%.

Immediate HSRs are rare but potentially harmful events may occur leading to death. These events include nonallergic and allergic reactions and manifest by cutaneous and/or mucosal signs such as generalized erythema, extended urticaria, angioedema (grade 1), mild cardiovascular (tachycardia, hypotension) and/or mild respiratory signs (coughing, dyspnea), with or without cutaneous or gastrointestinal signs (severe nausea, vomiting or diarrhea) (grade 2), cardiovascular collapse, possibly associated with bronchoconstriction (grade 3), or cardiac arrest (grade 4). The reported incidence of immediate HSRs to GBCAs is around 0.1%.

Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) is another rare but life-threatening condition, which has been related to the use of some GBCAs, especially in patients with end-stage chronic kidney disease. Initially described as nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy, it is a diffuse fibrosis of tissue (skin and systemic tissues) disorder arising in the setting of advanced renal dysfunction. The first case of NSF related to GBCA injection was reported in 2006. Data from the International Centre for NSF Registry, the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS), and a legal data set showed that all single agent cases of NSF were associated with linear GBCAs. The prevalence of NSF after exposure to a linear GBCA (gadodiamide) was reported as ranging from 3% to 7% in patients with reduced renal function. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) have subsequently issued a warning regarding GBCA use (in 2006 and 2007, respectively), which led to a significant decrease in the incidence of NSF over the following years. –

2.3 Anaphylaxis as outcome measure of severity

To assess severity of AGS episodes, we abstracted all self‐reported and physician‐documented signs and symptoms, which we categorized based on the organ system involved: mucocutaneous (e.g. hives/urticaria, itching, redness of palms or soles, lip swelling, flushing, throat swelling, rash, tongue swelling, congestion, rhinorrhea, itchy throat); respiratory (e.g. shortness of breath, chest tightness, wheezing, respiratory distress or apnea, cough); cardiovascular (e.g. dizziness, syncope, hypotension, weakness or numbness, chest pain, tachycardia or palpitations); and gastrointestinal (e.g. abdominal pain or cramping, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, heartburn, indigestion, difficulty swallowing). Headache and muscle/joint pain or swelling were classified as 'other'. Anaphylaxis was defined as any reaction involving ≥ 2 organ systems. Patient data were reviewed independently by two medical providers to confirm final anaphylactic designation.

2.4 Characterization of patients experiencing‐associated reactions to dairy products

Avoidance of red meat is a mainstay of AGS management; however, for a subset of patients, avoidance of other mammalian derivatives including bovine‐derived milk or dairy products may also be necessary to prevent additional reactions. We therefore identified patients experiencing AGS reactions associated with ingestion of dairy products (dairy product‐reactive patients) and compared their clinical presentation and laboratory characteristics to patients who did not report signs or symptoms of AGS associated with dairy products (dairy product‐tolerant patients). Symptoms with dairy consumption can be due to etiologies other than AGS, including lactose intolerance, cow's milk allergy and lactase deficiency; therefore we report patients as dairy‐reactive only if (i) chart documentation stated that symptom onset was at least 2 h after dairy consumption [guidelines suggest the standard measurement interval to assess malabsorption and intolerance is 30 min],(ii) documentation stated dairy‐related symptoms were new in onset with AGS diagnosis, and (Iii) dairy‐related gastrointestinal symptoms occurred in conjunction with non‐GI signs/symptoms (e.g. urticaria, angioedema, hypotension). Using these criteria, 3 charts were excluded from symptom analysis portion of the results.

Acute urticaria and angioedema — anaphylaxis evaluation and epinephrine use: Acute urticaria and angioedema should be differentiated from anaphylaxis. (D). Urticarial/angioedema associated with signs and symptoms in organs other than the skin, such as the pulmonary tract (wheezing) and cough, gastrointestinal system (vomiting and diarrhea), nervous system (dizziness and loss of consciousness), or cardiac system (changes in blood pressure or heart rate), can occur in patients with anaphylaxis. Epinephrine should be prescribed if the diagnosis of anaphylaxis has not been excluded. (D), and physicians should prescribe epinephrine for patients with acute urticaria/angioedema when a diagnosis of anaphylaxis is suspected, including that in patients presenting with acute urticaria who might have the potential for development of anaphylaxis (eg, food allergen or insect sting), injectable epinephrine should be prescribed.

Medical Record Review Process and Clinical Definitions

The manual medical record review process included a standardized review tool. Manual review of sample cases with none, 1, or more variables during the period from CIED procedure date (eg, first day of antibiotic exposure) and the subsequent 45-day window period was completed. The surveillance period for antibiotic-associated allergic-type reactions was a maximum of 10 days after the last date of antibiotic exposure, which was calculated based on medication administration data, days of antibiotic dispensed, or both. Manually abstracted data included procedure date, adverse event date and type (eg, allergic-type reaction, adverse reaction, and other), triggered variable, culprit antibiotic, reaction noted, treatment received, and change in level of care (eg, outpatient to inpatient, inpatient to intensive care unit). Each event was then classified into allergic-type reaction, adverse reaction, or other or no event occurrence. Allergic-type reactions were defined as allergic signs or symptoms that could be immune-mediated hypersensitivity reactions, such as rash, hives, or anaphylaxis occurring after antibiotic exposure. Adverse reaction was defined as a nonimmunologically mediated undesired response to an antibiotic (eg, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Among patients who experienced an allergic-type reaction, severity of allergies was classified as mild, defined as not requiring medication or change in level of care; moderate, defined as requiring medication but no change in level of care; and severe, defined as requiring medication and change in level of care or intubation.

### An overview of chronic urticaria [^113EUAYD]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2002). Low credibility.

Acknowledging urticaria as a symptom of mast cell degranulation is stressed. The biology of the mast cell, and the recognized immunologic and non-immunologic mast cell secretagogues are individually discussed along with mechanisms of activation and mediators released. The major, preformed mediator histamine in the skin produces a prototypic, short-lived urticaria, however, the clinical spectrum and pattern of "hives" indicate that other mediators contribute to the polymorphism and variable behavior of this symptom. The clinical assessment is almost exclusively restricted to the history and physical examination. Features to review and examine are presented. The cause of "acute" urticaria is identifiable (by history) in the majority of patients, and except for hives that accompany an anaphylactic reaction, these patients rarely present to the physician for care. The persistent, or "chronic" hiver whose history cannot elicit a cause, is rarely triggered by an individual trigger, despite extensive professional evaluation. Evidence to support changing the chronological, "acute" and "chronic" classification of urticaria to "identifiable" and "non-identifiable" triggered urticaria is discussed, as is the futility of extensive, costly laboratory work-ups. The natural history of urticaria reveals that management should be directed toward allowing the patient to maintain an acceptable quality of life (with or without some urticaria), until the episode resolves.

### Management of urticaria: not too complicated, not too simple [^112ad1GH]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2015). Low credibility.

Is it necessary to perform extensive diagnostic studies by complementary testing in all patients with CSU?

The indiscriminate search for underlying causes that may include an extensive battery of tests is discouraged – due to low cost-effectiveness. A careful and detailed medical history and physical examination are essential. Patient-oriented questions are helpful to establish the type of chronic urticaria and to define baseline laboratory studies and/or other complementary tests tailored to the individual patient (Table 2). In most cases, there is no need to order an extensive work-up unless data from the clinical history suggest an underlying disease. Table 3 lists the essential tests that should be performed.

Table 2
Recommended data to obtain from the patient's medical history

Table 3
Minimal work-up studies on chronic spontaneous urticaria *

Key point: Unless suggested by the clinical history, there is no need to perform extensive tests when examining a CSU patient.

What is the differential diagnosis to be established for a patient with CSU?

Apart from urticaria vasculitis for which diagnosis is made through biopsy, It can be difficult to differentiate hives from other dermatoses (Table 4). However, the natural course differs in these pathologies. Erythema multiform clears on its own within a maximum of 3 weeks; it is included in the differential diagnosis because of its severity and should always be ruled out at the onset of symptoms, when it can resemble chronic urticaria. Autoinflammatory syndromes have symptoms that may be confused with chronic urticaria, but they are rare, and although skin rashes are always associated with systemic symptoms, itching is not as striking a feature as it is in the case of chronic urticaria. Certain systemic diseases are associated with urticaria-like lesions, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, Schnitzler syndrome (IgM monoclonal gammopathy, urticaria, fever, lymphadenopathy and weight loss), mastocytosis and hypereosinophilic syndromes.

Table 4
Differential diagnosis of chronic urticaria

Key point: Chronic urticaria differs from other dermatosis on its duration, the evanescence of lesions and intense itching.

Aloe vera topical therapy for mild psoriasis — In patients who are not allergic to aloe vera (AV), topical AV may be efficacious for mild psoriasis, with an RCT of 60 patients comparing thrice-daily AV vs placebo for 4 weeks reporting 83.3% cure rate in the AV group vs 6.6% in the placebo group; however, a double-blind RCT with 40 patients showed no difference after 4 weeks of twice-daily application, and the clinical score sum decreased in 72.5% in AV-treated areas compared with 82.5% in placebo-treated areas after 12 weeks. Risks include skin irritation, hives, cramping, diarrhea, and a risk of contact dermatitis, and treatment should not be used in patients who are allergic to AV; for patients interested in a plant-based option for mild psoriasis, AV may be a reasonable consideration.

Alpha-gal syndrome — differential diagnosis and testing guidance for gastroenterology clinicians advises considering alpha-gal syndrome in patients with unexplained gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in alpha-gal–prevalent areas, performing serum alpha-gal IgE testing in such patients, avoiding testing when red flag features are present, and recognizing that skin findings may be absent. Clinicians should consider alpha-gal syndrome in the differential diagnosis of patients with unexplained GI symptoms of abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting, particularly those who live or have lived in an alpha-gal–prevalent area, and such patients should undergo serum testing for alpha-gal IgE antibodies. Clinicians should consider not testing those with red flag symptoms such as anemia, GI bleeding, or weight loss because the allergy does not cause these symptoms, and skin symptoms such as urticaria and angioedema may or may not be present.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^115mUmpB]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Chronic urticaria (CU) initial evaluation and lesion characterization — The initial patient evaluation should be focused to determine (through history and physical examination) whether the lesions that patients describe are consistent with CU (D). Lesions are typically edematous pink or red wheals with surrounding erythema, are generally pruritic, and individual lesions usually fade within 24 to 48 hours; painful or burning dysesthesia suggests cutaneous vasculitis, and angioedema is nonpruritic, brawny, nonpitting edema without erythema affecting the lips, tongue, eyelids, and genitalia. The clinician should obtain objective assessments of body surface area covered in hives, itch severity, and quality of life at the initial and each subsequent visit, and photographic documentation might assist in determining consistency with urticaria or angioedema. The medical work-up should be done while keeping in mind that CU is of undetermined cause in the majority of cases (C).

### Management of anaphylaxis in child care centers: evaluation 6 and 12 months after an intervention program [^111CQCg1]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Many young children with a history of allergic reactions or anaphylaxis spend considerable time in child care centers. We previously reported that a significant knowledge deficit exists in anaphylaxis recognition, evaluation, and treatment and that greater anaphylaxis education is needed among child care providers.

Objective

To determine whether child care centers can recognize, evaluate, and treat anaphylactic episodes in children aged 1 to 6 years 6 months and 1 year after attending an allergy seminar.

Methods

All 39 child care centers participating in the original study were selected to complete 6-month and 1-year follow-up surveys using a similar questionnaire. Those who did not attend the seminar or complete all the previous surveys were excluded.

Results

At 6 months and 1 year, 37 and 29 centers, respectively, completed surveys. There was a significant improvement regarding when to administer intramuscular epinephrine compared with before the allergy seminar. However, only 48% of the centers at 6 months (P = 0.02) and 31% at 1 year (P = 0.002) knew how to correctly administer intramuscular epinephrine compared with 77% four weeks after the seminar. With time, there was a significant decline in correctly recognizing typical anaphylaxis symptoms, including abdominal cramping, chest tightness, shortness of breath, low blood pressure, and diarrhea, whereas symptoms such as hives, swelling, and wheezing continued to be identified correctly.

Conclusions

There is a need for renewed anaphylaxis education among child care providers. Initially, this intervention significantly increased the ability of child care center staff to recognize, evaluate, and treat anaphylaxis, but knowledge diminished gradually at 6-month and 1-year follow-up.

### Mast cell mediators in allergic inflammation and mastocytosis [^117G7Tk3]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Mast cells possess an array of potent inflammatory mediators capable of inducing acute symptoms after cell activation, including urticaria, angioedema, bronchoconstriction, diarrhea, vomiting, hypotension, cardiovascular collapse, and death in few minutes. In contrast, mast cells can provide an array of beneficial mediators in the setting of acute infections, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer. The balance between the detrimental and beneficial roles of mast cells is not completely understood. Although the symptoms of acute mast cell mediator release can be reversed with epinephrine, adrenergic agonists, and mediator blockers, the continued release of histamine, proteases, prostaglandins, leukotrienes, cytokines, and chemokines leads to chronic and debilitating disease, such as mastocytosis. Identification of the molecular factors and mechanisms that control the synthesis and release of mast cell mediators should benefit all patients with mast cell activation syndromes and mastocytosis.

Case report

A 30-year-old Caucasian female, with a history of hypersensitivity to radiocontrast media and sulfa drugs and who had previously taken a PEG-3350 bowel preparation without adverse effects, presented for evaluation of chronic diarrhea. An upper and lower gastrointestinal endoscopy, and small bowel series were scheduled. GoLYTELY ® was prescribed prior to colonoscopy for bowel cleansing. Within a few minutes of taking the bowel preparation, her throat became itchy, followed by generalized pruritus, and chest pressure. She presented by car to the emergency department. On examination there were symmetric erythema of the forearms and hives on the chest. The symptoms completely resolved after administration of an antihistamine and oral corticosteroid. Due to concern for hypersensitivity to PEG-3350, the patient was discharged with new bowel lavage instructions that included a regimen of magnesium citrate and Gatorade ® (The Gatorade Company, Chicago, IL). The alternative bowel preparation was well tolerated and resulted in adequate bowel cleansing.

Colonoscopy and upper endoscopy were normal, but small bowel series revealed innumerable sand-like lucencies in the jejunum that became less prominent distally (Fig. 1). These findings were concerning for NLH as seen with giardiasis, histoplasmosis, Whipple's disease, mastocytosis, immunodeficiency syndromes, lymphoma, and early occult Crohn's disease. Wireless capsule endoscopy confirmed jejunal nodularity biopsied on antegrade enteroscopy (Fig. 2). The mucosal biopsy also showed pathologic NLH involving the jejunum.

### Acute and chronic urticaria: evaluation and treatment [^112xXbHJ]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on acute urticaria:

- **Definition**: Acute urticaria is a self-limited cutaneous condition characterized by transient, erythematous, and pruritic wheals or hives.
- **Pathophysiology**: Acute urticaria is caused by mast cell and basophil activation, leading to the release of histamine and other inflammatory mediators, which results in vasodilation and increased vascular permeability, leading to characteristic skin lesions. The activation of these cells can occur through multiple triggers, including IgE- and non-IgE-mediated mechanisms.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of acute urticaria in the United Kingdom is estimated at 355 per 100,000 population.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, acute urticaria presents as itchy, raised welts that can appear anywhere on the body. These hives are transient, often moving from one area of the body to another. In some cases, acute urticarial lesions may display central clearing with an ecchymotic or hemorrhagic hue.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of acute urticaria is generally good, as it is typically a self-limiting condition that resolves within 6 weeks.

### Isolated gastrointestinal alpha-gal meat allergy is a cause for gastrointestinal distress without anaphylaxis [^112XtKbx]. Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In our study, patients with alpha-gal meat allergy developed GI symptoms — most commonly episodic abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea — without more traditional manifestations of food allergy such as hives, angioedema, or anaphylaxis. Adhering to a mammalian meat-free diet led to significant symptom improvement or resolution in three-fourths of patients.

Within the allergy literature, reports of isolated GI alpha-gal allergy exist. Among 114 patients diagnosed with the allergy in South Africa and challenged with beef sausage under observation, 81 reacted, and among those, almost half were limited to GI symptoms — 25% with vomiting and/or diarrhea and 21% with severe and persistent abdominal cramping alone. After an observed challenge of pork sausage among 12 patients with the allergy in the United States, 2 patients developed isolated GI distress.

This is a small observational study and has many limitations. We did not perform a formal oral challenge test, and both improvement in symptoms and reactions to meat consumption after diagnosis were based on subjective reports. There may be overlap of GI symptoms with other causes of GI distress such as lactose.

Future prospective studies would ideally involve validated patient-reported symptom measures over time. Prospective studies also could better ascertain the time frame from diet change to symptom improvement and the degree of elimination, including that of dairy, gelatin, and flavorings that contain animal-derived products, that are associated with symptom resolution.

We observed a lower median alpha-gal titer compared with other cohorts with anaphylaxis, and our patient with the highest titer did develop anaphylaxis on follow-up. However, more work is needed to define whether titer predicts severity of response. In conclusion, our findings suggest that screening with alpha-gal IgE may be a reasonable strategy in patients who live in areas with known cases of alpha-gal allergy and present with new-onset GI symptoms, particularly episodic abdominal pain, diarrhea, and nausea, even in the absence of rash or anaphylaxis.

Mastocytosis is a heterogeneous disorder that results from clonal mast cell proliferation. Symptoms are typically limited to the skin in the pediatric population, requiring only symptomatic treatment with spontaneous resolution by puberty. Disease course in adults ranges from minimally symptomatic in most to highly aggressive but tends to be persistent. Symptoms can be protean and nonspecific. The mainstay of treatment consists of avoidance of triggers of mast cell degranulation and symptom-based therapy.

Conclusions

Mastocytosis should be suspected in patients who present with a constellation of symptoms, including flushing, abdominal pain, diarrhea, unexplained syncope, and classic urticaria pigmentosa lesions. Diagnosis should be established by a bone marrow biopsy in all adults. Staging should be performed to assess disease burden and evidence of end-stage organ damage. Patients should be offered symptom-based treatment and cytoreductive therapy only for aggressive systemic mastocytosis or an associated hematologic malignant neoplasm.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^11422N3j]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Annotation 12 — Management of chronic urticaria/angioedema and periodic reassessment: Management entails realistic expectations, daily use of medications, appropriate avoidance measures, and regular follow-up, with periodic reassessment to determine response to therapy and to evaluate clinical changes over time; further work-up might be needed to rule out underlying causes or development of concomitant conditions, and a more detailed evaluation might be warranted for selected patients. If a biopsy is considered, consider conditions that might require special testing and coordinate this with a dermatopathologist, and objective assessments of the percentage of the body covered in hives, itch severity, and quality of life at the initial visit and each subsequent visit are also important. Complicating factors, such as use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents or an ACE inhibitor in a patient with episodic angioedema, are examples of medications that might compromise patient outcomes, and lack of salutary response to antihistamines taken regularly can also suggest that further evaluation for an alternative condition is warranted.

### Diagnosing IgE-mediated food allergy: how to apply the latest guidelines in clinical practice [^112MBa7t]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

In some cases, it is useful to consider tolerance starting with the cooked product and then subsequently evaluating the raw food. If spices or aromatic herbs are being tested, clinicians can add a small quantity to a food commonly consumed by the patient, like rice or potatoes, and test the preparation starting from a small amount.

Challenges are usually stopped if clinical reactions are observed or if the last dose is consumed without eliciting clinical symptoms. The PRACTALL approach suggests grouping signs and symptoms during challenges into 3 categories to aid the decision of when to discontinue or proceed to the next challenge dose:
1 If there are no symptoms, the challenge should continue.
2 If there is a possible reaction, pause and reassess.
3 If there is a definite reaction, stop the challenge.

If observed symptoms are inconclusive, it may be appropriate to consider repeating a challenge dose, delaying the next dose, or stopping the challenge and repeating on another day. Objective symptoms that recur after 3 doses or persist (eg, for 40 minutes) are more likely to indicate a reaction than when such symptoms are transient and not reproducible. Clinicians need to weigh the risks versus benefits of continuing the challenge (Table V).

Table V
Challenge stopping criteria

Signs of an IgE-mediated allergic reaction during challenges often include the skin (urticaria, angioedema). They may also include the following systems: cutaneous (urticaria, angioedema, flushing, scratching), gastrointestinal (dysphagia, vomiting, abdominal cramping, diarrhea), respiratory (sneezing, rhinorrhea, coughing, wheezing, stridor, dysphonia, aphonia), cardiovascular (pallor, hypotension, loss of consciousness), and behavioral (change in activity/behavior, especially in young children and infants).

Immediate reactions usually appear within 2 hours of the last food intake, so patients should be observed for at least 1 to 2 hours for an immediate-type reaction.

A food challenge result will be regarded as negative when the patient tolerated the food. This usually means that the amount of food protein ingested without symptoms is equivalent to a normal serving of the food prepared in the usual manner, except when "low dose" threshold challenges are performed and the target dose is much lower than a usual serving size. These threshold challenges are performed to identify the allergen dose that the patient is reacting to rather than to diagnose food allergy.

### Consider hereditary angioedema in the differential diagnosis for unexplained recurring abdominal pain [^1173vdMQ]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

TABLE 2
Gastrointestinal Disorders That Overlap the Abdominal Symptoms of HAE

Episodic abdominal pain; recurrent small bowel obstruction without a surgical history and no clear etiology; or nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea with complete resolution between episodes warrant consideration of HAE as part of the differential diagnosis. Pertinent history may include recurrent episodes of cutaneous angioedema without pruritus and urticaria. Factors to consider in recognizing HAE in patients with GI symptoms are summarized in Table 3. Although most HAE attacks have no identifiable trigger, in females, HAE attacks may be brought on by normal hormonal fluctuations or the use of medications such as estrogen-containing oral contraceptives. In HAE, recurrent abdominal pain may vary in severity but typically occurs as severe intermittent episodes lasting 2 to 5 days if untreated, with normal asymptomatic periods between attacks. Abdominal pain in HAE is often described as cramping, colicky, tiring, or exhausting. During an attack, patients may have abdominal distension, tenderness, and possibly ascites. Ascites was detected in 92% of HAE patients who underwent abdominal ultrasound during an abdominal HAE attack. In our clinical experience, fever, peritoneal signs, or elevated white blood cell counts are not common during HAE attacks. These signs and symptoms would be more common with an acute abdominal pathology or familial Mediterranean fever. Elevated neutrophil counts (without increased bands), hypovolemia from fluid losses, and hemoconcentration have been reported in severe attacks. Nonresponse to glucocorticoids, antihistamines, or epinephrine is an additional indication that a mechanism other than histamine-mediated angioedema is involved.

Are there biomarkers of activity in CSU?

The severity of CSU should be evaluated based on the intensity of its clinical symptoms. Several biomarkers, such as interleukin (IL)-6, C-reactive protein and D-dimers, metalloproteinase-9 and complement C3 and C4, have shown distinctive patterns in CSU patients, but these molecules have still not been validated as useful biomarkers.

Key point: Although several substances may show specific levels in CSU patients, they have not yet been validated as CSU biomarkers.

Does isolated angioedema have clinical, therapeutic and/or prognostic implications?

Isolated angioedema with no hives that responds to antihistamines should be explored and phenotyped. Most guidelines – include isolated angioedema as a subtype of CSU. However, this condition does not share the typical features of chronic urticaria, such as being more frequent in women or having an autoimmune profile. In certain cases, typical CSU starts with isolated angioedema that evolves into cutaneous wheals. On the other hand, histaminergic angioedema is clearly different from bradykinin-mediated angioedema, which does not respond to antihistamines or corticosteroids, has a different physiopathology – and requires a different treatment approach. The differential diagnosis for isolated angioedema is shown in Table 5.

Table 5
Differential diagnosis of isolated angioedema

Key point: Isolated angioedema does not share the typical features of CSU.

How should the diagnosis of CSU in children be approached?

Chronic spontaneous urticaria is less frequent in children, but in general, it shares the underlying causes and physiopathology of CSU in adults. Therefore, the diagnostic approach in children and adults is the same. However, it should be noted that infants are more prone to develop acute urticaria secondary to an infection.

Key point: The diagnostic approach to CSU in children should be the same as that in adults.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

AUGMENTIN is generally well tolerated. The majority of side
effects observed in clinical trials were of a mild and transient nature and less
than 3% of patients discontinued therapy because of drug-related side effects.
The most frequently reported adverse effects were diarrhea/loose stools (9%),
nausea (3%), skin rashes and urticaria (3%), vomiting (1%) and vaginitis (1%).
The overall incidence of side effects, and in particular diarrhea, increased
with the higher recommended dose. Other less frequently reported reactions
include: Abdominal discomfort, flatulence, and headache.

The following adverse reactions have been reported for ampicillin-class
antibiotics:

Gastrointestinal

Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, indigestion, gastritis, stomatitis.
glossitis, black "hairy" tongue, mucocutaneous candidiasis, enterocolitis, and
hemorrhagic/pseudomembranous colitis. Onset of pseudomembranous colitis symptoms
may occur during or after antibiotic treatment. (See WARNINGS.)

Hypersensitivity Reactions

Skin rashes, pruritus, urticaria, angioedema, serum sickness−like
reactions (urticaria or skin rash accompanied by arthritis, arthralgia, myalgia.
and frequently fever), erythema multiforme (rarely Stevens-Johnson syndrome),
acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, hypersensitivity vasculitis, and an
occasional case of exfoliative dermatitis (including toxic epidermal necrolysis)
have been reported. These reactions may be controlled with antihistamines and,
if necessary, systemic corticosteroids. Whenever such reactions occur, the drug
should be discontinued, unless the opinion of the physician dictates otherwise.
Serious and occasional fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions can occur
with oral penicillin. (See WARNINGS.)

### Nutrition and urticaria [^114hgwXx]. Clinics in Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Urticaria is a distressing dermatologic condition for many. Although the wheals of urticaria are characteristically evanescent, lasting less than 24 hours, patients tend to have recurrent episodes. Hives that last less than 6 weeks are considered acute urticaria. Acute urticaria does not routinely require supplementary work-up because the history often identifies a convincing, inciting allergen. Chronic urticaria is defined as episodes that occur for longer than 6 weeks, and there is often not an easily identifiable trigger. For both acute and chronic urticaria, patients frequently report food as a precipitating cause. For acute urticaria, the foods that are associated with true allergies, such as nuts and shellfish, are the most frequent offenders. The relationship between diet and chronic urticaria is not as firmly defined. Many patients unnecessarily restrict their diets, so it becomes the role of dermatologists to help patients identify if there is a reproducible link between their symptoms and their dietary exposures. The literature suggests that diets free from pseudoallergens and histamine-releasing foods may attenuate urticaria. Supplements such as fats, vitamin D, iron, and flavonoids have also been studied and may diminish symptoms.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^1172mi2J]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Guidelines for diagnostic work-up of patients with CU present detailed history, selective laboratory evaluation, and conditional additional testing. History and physical examination items include Onset (eg, timing of symptoms with any change in medication or other exposures), Frequency, duration, severity, and localization of wheals and itching, Known precipitating factors of urticaria (eg, physical stimuli, exertion, stress, food, or medications), Associated angioedema or systemic manifestations (eg, headache, joint pain, or gastrointestinal symptoms), Known allergies, intolerances, infections, systemic illnesses, or other possible causes, Family history of urticaria and atopy, Degree of impairment of quality of life, Response to prior treatment, and Physical examination. For laboratory evaluation, Testing should be selective. A majority of members of the Practice Parameters Task Force expressed a consensus for the following routine tests in managing a patient with CU without atypical features: CBC with differential; Erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein level, or both; Liver enzymes; TSH. The utility of performing the above tests routinely for patients with CU has not been established. Additional evaluation might be warranted based on patients' circumstances and might include but not be limited to the diagnostic tests listed below. A thorough history and meticulous physical examination are essential for determining whether these additional tests are appropriate: Skin biopsy; Physical challenge tests; Complement system (eg, C3, C4, and CH50); Stool analysis for ova and parasites; Urinalysis; Hepatitis B and C serologies; Chest radiography, other imaging studies, or both; Anti-nuclear antibody; Rheumatoid factor, anti-citrullinated protein; Cryoglobulin levels; Serologic and/or skin testing for immediate hypersensitivity; Thyroid autoantibodies; Serum protein electrophoresis. More detailed laboratory tests, skin biopsies, or both merit consideration if urticaria is not responding to therapy as anticipated, and Additional laboratory testing might be required before initiation of certain medications, such as G6PD screening before prescribing dapsone.

### Chronic idiopathic urticaria: systemic complaints and their relationship with disease and immune measures [^112Yp8oj]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU)/chronic spontaneous urticaria sometimes report systemic complaints (SCs).

Objective

We sought to determine the frequency and characteristics of SCs among patients with CIU, as well as the association of SCs with disease measures, basophil histamine release, and serum tryptase.

Methods

Adult patients with CIU were recruited from a university allergy clinic. Patients completed a disease symptom survey and underwent blood sampling for subsequent basophil histamine release and serum tryptase measurement.

Results

A total of 155 patients with CIU were surveyed, with 103 reporting SCs with concomitant hives as follows: joint pain or swelling (55.3%), headache/fatigue (47.6%), flushing (42.7%), wheezing (30.1%), gastrointestinal complaints (26.2%), and palpitations (9.7%). Patients with SCs (CIU-SC) were compared with those with no SCs (CIU-NSC). Both groups had similar demographic characteristics (average age in 40s, majority female and white) and basophil histamine release profiles. CIU-SC had significantly greater disease duration (51.5% CIU-SC vs 30.8% CIU-NSC had > 4 years duration), emergency department visits (41.7% vs 23.1% had > 1 visit in the last year), CIU-related work absences (65% vs 27.5% had > 1 day), oral corticosteroid use (84.5% vs 59.6%), quality-of-life impairment (76.1 vs 59.2 SkinDex score), and serum tryptase levels (5.1 ng/mL vs 3.9 ng/mL).

Conclusions

Despite similar demographic characteristics and basophil profiles as patients with CIU-NSC, patients with CIU-SC have features of greater disease burden (work absences, emergency department visits, and corticosteroid use), quality-of-life impairment, and baseline serum tryptase levels.

### Urticarial dermatitis herpetiformis: a rare presentation of an uncommon disorder [^1124SseR]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The classic symptoms of gluten-sensitive enteropathy include chronic diarrhea, malabsorption, and weight loss. However, not all patients present with this classic manifestation. Some patients may have minor gastrointestinal disease or only extraintestinal symptoms, while others may present with anemia, osteoporosis, failure to thrive, and other signs of malabsorption. While DH is associated with an enteropathy in over 90% of cases, the enteropathy may not be symptomatic, as in our patient.

Lesions in DH vary widely, thus predisposing to misdiagnosis and leading to delayed definitive diagnosis and treatment. Furthermore, the histopathology of DH is nonspecific in as many as 40% of skin biopsies — even, rarely, upon repeat biopsy. For this reason, DIF studies, which are far more sensitive and specific, are concomitantly performed when a diagnosis of DH is under consideration. However, though DIF with granular dermoepidermal IgA deposition is considered pathognomonic, there are reports of alternative immunofluorescence patterns, in particular, fibrillar IgA deposition.

Serologies considered a confirmatory test for DH due to their high sensitivity (50%-95%) and specificity (> 90%), can additionally be used to monitor response to a gluten-free diet. As DH is considered a cutaneous expression of CD, duodenal biopsy in cases of proven DH is not strictly necessary, though it is the gold standard for celiac diagnosis. Duodenal biopsies performed in patients with DH are variable, with mild to moderate villous atrophy present in approximately 75% of patients. In the remaining 25%, including our patient, intraepithelial lymphocytosis is present with no evidence of villous atrophy. Such findings are nonspecific for celiac disease and may have several other etiologies.

With the broad range of possible presentations and clinical and histopathological findings that may be uniformly nonspecific or misleading, DH can prove an elusive diagnosis. One case of DH presenting as chronic urticaria in a child — notably nonpruritic and asymptomatic — has previously been reported. Other cases in the literature have highlighted unusual presentations, including palmoplantar keratosis and prurigo pigmentosa-like lesions. Our case report emphasizes that patients with chronic pruritus and skin eruption in typical anatomic sites for DH, even in the absence of gastrointestinal or systemic symptoms, should undergo workup for celiac disease to avoid diagnostic delay. Furthermore, as has also been demonstrated elsewhere in the literature, continued follow-up with repeat biopsies may be required as initial histopathologic studies may fail to demonstrate classic features.

### Diagnosing IgE-mediated food allergy: how to apply the latest guidelines in clinical practice [^111jMVZ9]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

Practical diagnostic pathway

There are 4 key steps in our practical pathway:
1 Clinical history.
2 Sensitization assessment.
3 Oral food challenge.
4 Diagnosis.

In this section, we describe each of these steps, including when to test and how to interpret the test results.

Step 1: Clinical history

Why

People suspected of food allergy can present with a variety of symptoms affecting the skin (urticaria, angioedema, atopic eczema/dermatitis), gastrointestinal (vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea), respiratory (rhinorrhea, sneezing, cough, dyspnea), and cardiovascular systems (circulatory collapse). These symptoms can also be nonallergic or caused by other conditions, which need to be considered before diagnosing food allergy. This means it is essential to take a careful clinical history as well as an allergy-focused diet history (Fig 2). The aim is to link allergic symptoms to the foods ingested and to consider the likelihood of food allergy. Taking a diet history can also help to distinguish primary food allergy versus food allergy that results from cross-reactions with pollens.

Fig 2
Things to consider in clinical and nutritional history.

Eczema is a special situation because many children with food allergy have eczema. Those with eczema may be suspected of having food allergy, even though eczema is usually not caused by food allergies. It can be difficult to distinguish between those who have food allergies that affect eczema and those who do not, so guidelines suggest that food allergy should be explored in children with severe persistent eczema and possible food allergy symptoms, especially if combined with other atopic manifestations.

How

Box 1 lists practical questions that may be asked during allergy-focused history taking.

Box 1
Questions to ask during allergy-focused history taking

Who

Child and adult allergy specialists, pediatricians, internists, nurses, and dieticians can all be trained to take clinical and diet histories. In some countries, primary care team members with special interests may be trained. Patients and their families may be asked to keep food diaries to support history taking.

Step 2: Sensitization

### Mast cell activation disorder and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome: a clinical association [^114Sh2LS]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) was initially characterized in a small group of highly selected individuals in whom palpitations and lightheadedness, triggered by upright posture, were deemed to be caused by a limited form of autonomic dysfunction. Subsequently, however, the POTS diagnosis has increasingly been suspected and/or applied much more broadly, encompassing patients with often poorly understood symptoms involving multiple organ systems and that are not typically considered to be caused by POTS.

The cause of POTS in individual patients is usually unknown, despite a number of conditions having been implicated; these include viral illnesses, trauma, and various inflammatory diseases. Mast cell activation (MCA) disorder has also been implicated since chemical mediators released from mast cells may cause symptoms suggestive of POTS (eg, postural tachycardia, lightheadedness). On the other hand, MCA mediators may also result in systemic nonorthostatic symptoms that are not typical of POTS such as flushing, urticaria, angioedema, nasal congestion, airway reactivity, vomiting, headache, and diarrhea.

Recently, 2 sets of consensus criteria have been proposed for diagnosis of MCA disorder. While these criteria have some differences, both define the disorder as a chronic condition affecting 2 or more systems driven by the aberrant release of mast cell biochemical mediators. Valent and colleaguesrequire that the acute symptoms be associated with documented elevations of mast cell mediators on at least 2 occasions. Afrin and colleaguesinclude elevations in mast cell mediators (either during an acute episode or at baseline) as 1 criterion, but indicate that it is possible to fulfill diagnostic criteria without elevations in mast cell mediators.

The possibility that MCA disorder may be associated with POTS either as a trigger or as a coexisting condition is now widely accepted, but how often is unknown. This study examined the frequency with which symptoms and laboratory findings suggesting MCA disorder occurred in patients referred for POTS evaluation and who were ultimately diagnosed with POTS based upon currently published criteria.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^117Btbxz]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute urticaria and angioedema — definition, evaluation, and initial treatment: Urticaria and angioedema with a duration of less than 6 weeks is termed acute urticaria. Urticaria/angioedema with systemic signs can occur in anaphylaxis, and epinephrine should be prescribed if the diagnosis of anaphylaxis has not been excluded. Because acute urticaria and angioedema will usually resolve spontaneously, laboratory evaluation for chronic illness is also not required unless supported by the clinical history or physical examination, and empiric elimination diets (not guided by history and testing) are not recommended; extensive evaluation for specific viral pathogens or antiviral therapy is not indicated unless suggested by the clinical history. For acute urticaria, skin testing or immunoassays can be helpful if an allergic cause is suggested by history, usually after resolution of acute urticaria and after suspension of antihistamines or via serologic testing when significant dermatographism is present; skin biopsy is not indicated in most cases but might occasionally be useful for differentiating from other inflammatory disorders. Common causes, including medications and foods, should be identified by detailed history and eliminated if possible. For treatment, antihistamines are efficacious in most cases and recommended as first-line therapy; first-generation antihistamines can be associated with sedation and impaired motor skills, whereas these impairments are less evident or not evident with second-generation antihistamines as a class. In patients with poor response to antihistamines, a brief course of oral corticosteroids might also be required while eliminating suspected triggers and developing an effective plan.

### Idiopathic anaphylaxis: a form of mast cell activation syndrome [^115xGRhM]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). Medium credibility.

Idiopathic anaphylaxis is a condition caused by paroxysmal episodes of sudden-onset multiorgan involvement variably including laryngeal edema, urticaria, bronchoconstriction, dyspnea, hypoxia, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and hypotension. Rarely, the episodes can lead to cardiovascular collapse and death in the absence of a clear trigger, especially in the presence of other cardiovascular comorbidities. Elevated mast cell mediators such as tryptase and histamine have been reported during episodes, and mast cells are considered the primary cells responsible for driving anaphylaxis in humans. Basophils also secrete histamine and LTC4 when activated and theoretically can contribute to symptoms. As our understanding of mast cell disorders continue to grow, the classification for these disorders evolves. The purpose of this article was 2-fold: to review the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of idiopathic anaphylaxis and to discuss the classification of idiopathic anaphylaxis within the broader context of mast cell activation disorders.

Results

Diagnosis of CSU, physical examination and complementary testing in chronic urticaria (work-up studies)

What are the clinical features of CSU? What are the characteristics of the macroscopic and microscopic cutaneous lesions?

Chronic spontaneous urticaria skin lesions are transient and pruritic and appear daily or almost daily for at least 6 weeks. This condition is accompanied by angioedema in 40–50% of patients. The hives last < 24 h, with no skin lesion upon disappearance. However, interstitial oedema with a perivascular infiltrate containing lymphocytes, monocytes and eosinophils is observed in all cases. Neutrophils and basophils may also be observed, and CD4 + T cells are also present. In cases of angioedema, the same histological findings are found, but the interstitial oedema is more intense.

Key point: Chronic urticaria lesions consist of evanescent wheals or hives surrounded by erythema.

What exacerbating factors are known?

The large majority of patients have no evidence of any exacerbating factor. The only recognized trigger for CSU is nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). In patients presenting with CSU associated with a degree of physical urticaria (Table 1), symptoms may be exacerbated when in contact with the corresponding stimulus, such as pressure in the case of delayed pressure urticarial, or scratches in the case of dermatographic urticaria.

Key point: NSAIDs are the main factor that exacerbates CSU.

What is the natural clinical course?

The natural course is unpredictable. CSU undergoes spontaneous remission, with relapses in most cases. Few epidemiological studies have explored the duration of symptoms. Gaig et al. found that in 70% of cases, chronic urticaria lasted one year, whereas in 11% of patients, it lasted for more than 5 years. In a prospective study of 139 patients followed over 5 years, the duration of urticaria correlated with its severity of urticaria, the presence of angioedema and positive autoimmune markers (positive autologous serum skin test [ASST] and antithyroid antibodies). That study found that 70% of patients had hives that lasted more than one year and 14% had symptoms 5 years after the end of the study period, durations very similar to those reported in other studies.

Key point: The evolution of CSU is unpredictable, with spontaneous remissions and relapses. No prospective and retrospective neither studies have examined the influence of treatments on the natural course of CSU.

### Clinical practice guideline: Bell's palsy [^111PfcaG]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Medium credibility.

Bell's palsy — antiviral monotherapy: Clinicians should not prescribe oral antiviral therapy alone for patients with new-onset Bell's palsy. Strong recommendation (against) based on high-quality randomized controlled trials with a preponderance of benefit over harm. Aggregate evidence quality: Grade A and Level of confidence in evidence: High. Evidence shows that antiviral therapy alone is no better than placebo with regard to facial nerve recovery in Bell's palsy and is inferior to steroid therapy with regard to facial nerve recovery rate, with acyclovir and valacyclovir the most extensively studied antivirals. The most comprehensive randomized controlled trial failed to find an improved rate of facial nerve recovery in 207 patients treated with valacyclovir alone, compared with 209 patients treated with placebo alone. Reported harms note gastrointestinal side effects (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) with rare severe reactions (hives, bronchospasm, angioedema, hepatic or renal failure), no serious adverse events were noted in the Bell's palsy literature, and antiviral therapy may carry an increased risk for pregnant patients. In summary, antiviral therapy alone (acyclovir or valacyclovir) is not recommended in the treatment of Bell's palsy due to lack of effectiveness of currently available drugs, unnecessary cost, and the potential for drug-related complications.

### The future of targeted therapy in chronic spontaneous urticaria [^113vBADL]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). Medium credibility.

Chronic urticaria can be divided into 2 subsets: chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) with skin lesions occurring without a specific trigger and chronic inducible urticaria, which has an identified specific stimulus. The annual prevalence of chronic urticaria is 0.5% to 2.3% globally. The CSU is a self-limited disorder in most cases, with an average duration of 2 to 5 years, but symptoms persist beyond 5 years in up to 30% of patients. The first line of treatment is a daily nonsedating, second-generation H1-antihistamine. The CSU guidelines recommend using oral nonsedating antihistamines up to 4 fold in patients with CSU unresponsive to standard doses as the next step in treatment. A meta-analysis found that the rate of response in patients with CSU who responded to updosing was 63.2%. Therefore, approximately 40% of patients continue to have persistent hives and itching requiring treatment with the biologic omalizumab, based on evidence from randomized controlled trials. Although omalizumab has been shown to markedly relieve symptoms of CSU, omalizumab is not effective in all patients and has not been shown to induce long-term disease remission. Thus, there is an unmet need for more effective treatments that can lead to cure or long-term remission. In this review, we will provide an overview of new treatment targets and biologics that are under investigation for the treatment of CSU.

### The role of coagulation / fibrinolysis biomarkers in pathophysiology, disease severity, and treatment response in patients with urticaria: a scoping review [^115Z2P1W]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Urticaria, characterized by hives, angioedema, or both, is an inflammatory skin disorder. It is also recognized as a mast cell-driven disease associated with histamine and other inflammatory mediators and is more commonly diagnosed in women. The high recurrence rate and bothersome symptoms, such as itching and hives, may cause severe negative impact on patients' quality of life. Although it is most often a self-limited disease, effectively treating patients with refractory urticaria remains a tremendous challenge. Its pathogenesis has not been fully elucidated and is a topic of debate. Exploring its underlying pathological mechanisms is conducive to better managing urticaria. Urticaria, especially chronic urticaria (CU) and its subtype chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), is frequently associated with autoimmunity and inflammatory responses. A suspected link between urticaria and coagulation cascade activation also exists. Recent researches indicate a multifaceted pathophysiology, involving the immune system, the inflammatory response and the coagulation/fibrinolysis process. Skin immune cells not only produce pro-inflammatory cytokines, but also promote the over-expression of coagulation factors, such as tissue factor (TF). The intricate interactions between the coagulation/fibrinolysis system and the immune system exacerbate the inflammatory response of urticaria and also increase the complexity of this disease, but the causal relationship among the three systems needed to be supported by stronger evidence.

### Food allergy test-guided dietary advice for children with atopic dermatitis: a consensus study [^113dUJy2]. Pediatric Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

3.5 Consensus on Decisions

Agreement on dietary advice to be given, based on different combinations of symptoms and SPT results for the four different foods, evolved over rounds two and three (Table S3). The equivocal SPT category was removed and advice for children who have never ingested the food added. Outcomes were reviewed at the workshop (Figure S1), with all areas of prior disagreement resolved. Based on feedback, "positive" SPTs were relabelled as "sensitized". The final flowchart (Figure 1) comprises nine pathways/outcomes.

FIGURE 1
Dietary advice flowchart. SPT: negative < 3 mm, sensitized ≥ 3 mm. Immediate symptoms: < 2 h worsening of eczema (new flare), hives (nettle rash), itching, swelling around the lips, face or eyes, diarrhea, abdominal pain, vomiting, coughing, wheezing, hoarse voice or cry, swelling of tongue or airway/stridor or sneezing. Delayed symptoms: > 2 h worsening of eczema (new flare), itching, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, blood and/or mucus in stool, vomiting. Eaten recently: ingestion within the last 2 months. Advice: Not allergic, include = continue to include in diet or reintroduce/introduce as normal if not currently/ever eaten. Allergic, exclude = exclude from diet until review in allergy clinic and/or oral food challenge. Home dietary trial of exclusion = exclude food for 4 weeks and reintroduce, to identify if any improvement/worsening in AD symptoms. Oral Food Challenge (OFC) = done under close medical supervision (in hospital) to find out if a child has an immediate allergic to a particular food. The child is gradually fed bigger doses of a single food, until the "top dose" is eaten without any symptoms, or a reaction occurs.

### MASTering systemic mastocytosis: lessons learned from a large patient cohort [^115CzxmU]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2024). Medium credibility.

Systemic mastocytosis (SM) is a rare mast cell disease affecting an estimated 1 in every 10,000 to 200,000 individuals. It is estimated that there are 32,000 patients with SM in the United States.SM is characterized by the proliferation of aberrant mast cells in multiple extracutaneous and cutaneous tissues, which can cause significant symptom burden and poor quality of life. In fact, patients with SM often experience debilitating symptoms, including (but not limited to) cutaneous symptoms (flushing, itching, and hives), gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain, diarrhea, and nausea and/or vomiting), neuropsychiatric symptoms (depression, mood changes, and "brain fog"), musculoskeletal disorders (bone and muscle pain and osteoporosis), and life-threatening anaphylaxis. These symptoms can occur in all cases of SM, including the most common type, which is termed indolent SM (ISM). In advanced SM, symptoms can include lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, pancytopenia, lytic bone lesions, and pathologic fractures, and they can be associated with various hematologic disorders. These advanced cases are termed SM with associated hematologic neoplasm (SM-AHN), aggressive SM (ASM), and mast cell leukemia (MCL).

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is a common skin disease characterised by intermittent weals (hives), angioedema or both lasting for at least 6 weeks.1–3 Second-generation antihistamines are widely used to manage symptoms but are not completely effective in many patients at licensed doses.4 Some guidelines recommend off-label use of high-dose antihistamines as the next therapeutic step.2,3 Here, we review the evidence supporting this recommendation.

### The urticaria spectrum: recognition of clinical patterns can help management [^1172t6Qk]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Urticaria has diverse clinical presentations and causes. The implication of classifying urticaria primarily by clinical presentation rather than aetiology is that management can be focused on specific clinical problems without extensive investigations. Management pathways may involve nonpharmacological measures and drug interventions, which can be grouped into first-, second- and third-line therapies. Stronger, but potentially more risky, second- and third-line approaches may be justified for patients who do not respond to first-line therapy with antihistamines even though it may not be possible to define a specific aetiology, such as autoimmune urticaria, with confidence.

Allergic reaction signs and symptoms in infants — organized by target organ — include the following. Skin/subcutaneous tissue manifestations are systemic urticaria, angioedema, flushing. Upper respiratory tract manifestations are rhinorrhea, sneezing, nasal congestion. Lower respiratory tract manifestations are cough, wheeze, stridor, shortness of breath, respiratory distress (intercostal retractions, accessory muscle use). Gastrointestinal tract manifestations are persistent profuse vomiting, diarrhea. Cardiovascular manifestations are tachycardia, hypotension. Central nervous system manifestations are behavioral change (irritability, inconsolable crying, clinging to caregiver, lethargy). Skin/subcutaneous tissue is the most common organ system involved in allergic reactions in infants, and the working definition of anaphylaxis applies to children of all ages, including infants.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^1169Smu6]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute urticaria and angioedema — duration-based definition and association with triggers: Acute urticaria and angioedema are differentiated from chronic urticaria and angioedema (CUA) based on duration of illness. (D), and the presence of urticaria and angioedema with a duration of less than 6 weeks is termed acute urticaria, with the distinction of 6 weeks as a dividing interval between acute urticaria and CU, although somewhat arbitrary, being useful because the most common cause of acute urticaria and angioedema, particularly in children, is a transient viral infection; for this reason, acute urticaria, in contrast to CUA, can often be associated with a specific cause or trigger.

4 | CLINICAL SPECTRUM OF IGE TO ALPHA-GAL: ASYMPTOMATIC TO LIFE-THREATENING ANAPHYLAXIS

The initial description of AGS stemmed from investigation into patients suffering clear anaphylactic reactions. Reactions to cetuximab were often severe, as were the initial case series of patients reacting to mammalian meat, which explains why the syndrome was often referred to as 'delayed anaphylaxis to red meat'.– We continue to see patients who have severe allergic reactions to mammalian meat, but equally, now appreciate a much greater spectrum of clinical heterogeneity (see Figure 3). In addition to inter-patient variability in symptoms, there can also be significant variability in reaction severity within a given individual. Urticaria and gastrointestinal symptoms are often reported in AGS patients, typically occurring 2–6 h after a relevant exposure. Some patients deny frank hives but develop skin pruritus with flushing-like presentation or pruritus in the absence of any visible rash. Symptoms for some patients tend to involve only one system but can present as a combination. Recent reports emphasize that many patients with AGS, including children, can have isolated gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. – These reports are also interesting as they raise the possibility that alpha-gal sensitization could be an underappreciated contributor to GI morbidity in areas where ticks are endemic.

Not all individuals who are sensitized to alpha-gal experience allergic reactions. One of the earliest studies that convincingly showed that many individuals who were sensitized could nonetheless tolerate mammalian meat was an investigation by Fischer et al. involving Forest Workers from Southwest Germany. This cohort, which was high risk on the basis of recurrent tick exposures, had an alpha-gal IgE prevalence of 35% (at a cut-off of ≥ 0.1 kUA/L), but over 90% of the sensitized workers routinely consumed mammalian meat without overt allergic symptoms. Subsequent studies of alpha-gal sensitization in individuals not recruited on the basis of meat allergy have shown similar findings. A recent paper by McGill and colleagues assessed GI symptoms among sensitized subjects in an endoscopy screening cohort and found that most routinely consumed mammalian meat regardless of sensitization status.

### Practical guidance for the evaluation and management of drug hypersensitivity: specific drugs [^113wnpwi]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). High credibility.

Antiparasitic agents — major symptoms and hypersensitivity manifestations are described across several drugs: For ivermectin, adverse effects include gastrointestinal upset, abdominal pain, fatigue, urticarial or maculopapular rashes, pruritus, and rarely, hepatotoxicity or neurologic side effects with a mucosal drug eruption with hemorrhagic scabs/erosions, and it has also been described to cause a Mazzotti-type reaction after treatment of onchocerciasis. Albendazole can cause abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea with rare transient transaminitis, agranulocytosis, and urticarial or other dermatologic manifestations, and contact urticaria and contact dermatitis have been described with fixed drug reaction reported. With mebendazole, more serious cutaneous manifestations have been reported in combination with metronidazole associated with an outbreak of SJS/TEN, and thiabendazole has been linked to dizziness, nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, pruritus, headache, neuropsychiatric disturbances, hepatitis, and hypersensitivity reactions such as SJS. For praziquantel, side effects include headache, dizziness, drowsiness, nausea, and abdominal discomfort, with less commonly itching/rash; although rare, hypersensitivity reactions to praziquantel have been described and mouse model data suggest anaphylactic reactions may be induced by parasite antigen release rather than true hypersensitivity to the parent drug. Diethylcarbamazine side effects include fever, headache, dizziness, abdominal pain and nausea, and urticaria/pruritus, and in onchocerciasis administration is associated with a risk of precipitating a reaction including fever, urticaria, tender lymphadenopathy, tachycardia, arthralgias, edema, orthostatic hypotension, and hypotension. Melarsoprol use is limited by toxicity occurring commonly with severe adverse effects including encephalopathy, polyneuropathy, exfoliative dermatitis, myocarditis, and hypersensitivity reactions such as bullous reactions.

### Methadone hydrochloride (methadone HCl) [^112ErX8r]. FDA (2008). Low credibility.

Heroin Withdrawal

During the induction phase of methadone maintenance treatment, patients are being withdrawn from heroin and may therefore show typical withdrawal symptoms, which should be differentiated from methadone-induced side effects. They may exhibit some or all of the following signs and symptoms associated with acute withdrawal from heroin or other opiates: lacrimation, rhinorrhea, sneezing, yawning, excessive perspiration, goose-flesh, fever, chilliness alternating with flushing, restlessness, irritability, weakness, anxiety, depression, dilated pupils, tremors, tachycardia, abdominal cramps, body aches, involuntary twitching and kicking movements, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, intestinal spasms, and weight loss.

Initial Administration

The initial methadone dose should be carefully titrated to the individual. Too rapid titration for the patient's sensitivity is more likely to produce adverse effects.

The major hazards of methadone are respiratory depression and, to a lesser degree, systemic hypotension. Respiratory arrest, shock, cardiac arrest, and death have occurred.

The most frequently observed adverse reactions include lightheadedness, dizziness, sedation, nausea, vomiting, and sweating. These effects seem to be more prominent in ambulatory patients and in those who are not suffering severe pain. In such individuals, lower doses are advisable.

Other adverse reactions include the following: (listed alphabetically under each subsection)

Body as a Whole

asthenia (weakness), edema, headache

Cardiovascular

(also see WARNINGS: Cardiac Conduction Effects) – arrhythmias, bigeminal rhythms, bradycardia, cardiomyopathy, ECG abnormalities, extrasystoles, flushing, heart failure, hypotension, palpitations, phlebitis, QT interval prolongation, syncope, T-wave inversion, tachycardia, torsade de pointes, ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia

Digestive

abdominal pain, anorexia, biliary tract spasm, constipation, dry mouth, glossitis

Hematologic and Lymphatic

reversible thrombocytopenia has been described in opioid addicts with chronic hepatitis

Metabolic and Nutritional

hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, weight gain

Nervous

agitation, confusion, disorientation, dysphoria, euphoria, insomnia, seizures

Respiratory

pulmonary edema, respiratory depression (see WARNINGS: Respiratory Depression)

Skin and Appendages

pruritis, urticaria, other skin rashes, and rarely, hemorrhagic urticaria

Urogenital

amenorrhea, antidiuretic effect, reduced libido and/or potency, urinary retention or hesitancy

### Rifabutin [^112hh4F1]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Patients who developed uveitis had mild to severe symptoms that resolved after treatment with corticosteroids and/or mydriatic eye drops; in some severe cases, however, resolution of symptoms occurred after several weeks.

When uveitis occurs, temporary discontinuance of rifabutin and ophthalmologic evaluation are recommended. In most mild cases, rifabutin may be restarted; however, if signs or symptoms recur, use of rifabutin should be discontinued (Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, September 9, 1994).

Corneal deposits have been reported during routine ophthalmologic surveillance of some HIV-positive pediatric patients receiving rifabutin as part of a multiple drug regimen for MAC prophylaxis. The deposits are tiny, almost transparent, asymptomatic peripheral and central corneal deposits, and do not impair vision.

The following table enumerates the changes in laboratory values that were considered as laboratory abnormalities in Studies 023 and 027.

The incidence of neutropenia in patients treated with rifabutin was significantly greater than in patients treated with placebo (p = 0.03). Although thrombocytopenia was not significantly more common among patients treated with rifabutin in these trials, rifabutin has been clearly linked to thrombocytopenia in rare cases. One patient in Study 023 developed thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, which was attributed to rifabutin.

Adverse Reactions from Post-Marketing Experience

Adverse reactions identified through post-marketing surveillance by system organ class (SOC) are listed below:

Blood and lymphatic system disorders: White blood cell disorders (including agranulocytosis, lymphopenia, granulocytopenia, neutropenia, white blood cell count decreased, neutrophil count decreased), platelet count decreased.

Immune system disorders: Hypersensitivity, bronchospasm, rash, and eosinophilia.

Gastrointestinal disorders: Clostridioides difficile colitis/ Clostridioides difficile associated diarrhea.

Pyrexia, rash and other hypersensitivity reactions such as eosinophilia and bronchospasm might occur, as has been seen with other antibacterials.

A limited occurrence of skin discoloration has been reported.

Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs):

Rifabutin has been associated with the occurrence of DRESS as well as other SCARs such as SJS, TEN, and AGEP (see WARNINGS).

Rifamycin hypersensitivity reactions:

Hypersensitivity to rifamycins have been reported including flu-like symptoms, bronchospasm, hypotension, urticaria, angioedema, conjunctivitis, thrombocytopenia or neutropenia.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^116D2sDb]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Urticarial vasculitis and hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis (HUVS) — patients with HUVS must present with urticaria, angioedema, or both for at least 6 months and hypocomplementemia, and urticaria is characterized by burning, pruritus, and longer duration (each hive can last 3 days) with possible hyperpigmentation on resolution. Leukocytoclastic vasculitis with fibrinoid necrosis is seen on biopsy, and immunofluorescence can reveal deposits of immunoglobulins, complement, and/or fibrin mostly in the dermal–epidermal junction; if clinical suspicion is consistent with cutaneous vasculitis and the biopsy result is negative, a repeat biopsy would merit consideration, and biopsy for direct immunofluorescence is preferably performed in lesions within 24 hours because loss of staining has been seen starting in less than 48 hours. Laboratory evaluation should include C1q, C4, and C3 measurement. Antihistamines can be used to manage pruritus but have no substantial effect on the vasculitic process; the dose of prednisone is 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/d for at least 1 week and then tapered slowly, hydroxychloroquine, colchicine, and dapsone have been used in case reports for management of UV, pentoxifylline (1200 mg/d) can be beneficial to enhance the effect of dapsone, patients with hepatitis A, B, or C and HIV might benefit from the use of IFN-α used with or without ribavirin, and for refractory disease azathioprine with prednisone (with antecedent testing for thiopurine methyltransferase deficiency) can be used; other therapies, such as cyclophosphamide, cyclosporin A, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), and methotrexate, have been used for severe cases.

### A large-scale study on the prevalence of intestinal parasites in patients referred to medical laboratories in urmia, northwest iran [^115Um7kg]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Blastocystis is classified in phylum stramenopile and is the most common enteric protozoa in the human intestinal tract. Currently, it is genetically classified into at least 34 subtypes (STs). ST1–9 and 12 are reported in humans and more than 90% of human infections are caused by ST1–4. Despite the high prevalence, the public health significance and pathogenicity remain uncertain. Blastocystis has been reported frequently in healthy individuals. It is also reported to decrease the population of gut microbiota e.g. Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus. The zoonotic aspect of Blastocystis is also hypothesized and may contribute to some infections. Blastocystis is also reported to be a neglected cause of urticaria and some skin disorders and is suggested to be treated in patients with urticaria or skin disorders who are infected by the parasite. In the present study, similar to other reports Blastocystis was the most prevalent parasite in the studied population, yet there was no relationship to abnormal stool consistency. However, in our previous study from Isfahan, the infection rate was significantly higher in patients with loose stool. Additionally, in the present study, Blastocystis was more prevalent in winter than in the other seasons.

Endolimax nan a is considered a nonpathogenic and commensal protozoon of the human colon that remains largely unexplored in terms of morphology, genetic diversity, taxonomy, host specificity, and epidemiology. However, E. nana is rarely reported to be responsible for cases of diarrhea, abdominal pain, polyarthritis, and urticaria in some individuals. Some reports considered Blastocystis and E. nana to be associated with diarrhea in children when they occur at a high prevalence and intensity. In the present study, E. nana infection was ranked second in terms of prevalence, yet there was no association with diarrhea. The prevalence was significantly high during winter.

Entamoeba coli is also considered a nonpathogenic organism of the gastrointestinal tract of humans. In 1991, E. coli was reported in 10 patients with diarrhea, which was resolved after treating the E. coli infection. In the present study, E. coli infection was in the third rank in terms of prevalence, yet there was no association with diarrhea.

### Resource use and costs in an insured population of patients with chronic idiopathic / spontaneous urticaria [^117LZXG1]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Urticaria is a dermatologic condition characterized by well-defined, pruritic, erythematous hives and wheals, associated with superficial swelling of the dermis. While most urticaria resolves spontaneously, a small proportion of the population develops chronic symptoms (defined as lasting at least 6 weeks). A minority of chronic urticaria cases may be attributed to a clear external cause such as physical stimuli; however, most cases are idiopathic and are termed chronic idiopathic or spontaneous urticaria (CIU/CSU). The average duration of CIU/CSU is 2–5 years, though CIU-related symptoms may persist beyond 5 years in nearly one-fifth of patients. Angioedema, swelling of the subcutaneous and submucosal tissues, accompanies CIU/CSU in more than a third of patients.

CIU/CSU lesions can severely impact patients' lives; directly, through itching, and indirectly, through disturbances in sleep and work/school-related daily activities. Patients with CIU/CSU have worse health-related quality of life than those with psoriasis or atopic dermatitis. Their degree of impairment is comparable to that observed in patients with severe ischemic heart disease. Treatment involves H 1 antihistamines as a first line, often at multiples of typical doses. For those who require additional treatment, a variety of medications are used, including oral corticosteroids (OCS), leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRA), and methotrexate, none of which has been US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for use in CIU/CSU. In 2014, omalizumab became the first drug to gain a FDA label to treat CIU/CSU in patients with inadequate response to H 1 antihistamines.

### Histamine and histamine intolerance [^113bNuMK]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2007). Low credibility.

Histamine intolerance results from a disequilibrium of accumulated histamine and the capacity for histamine degradation. Histamine is a biogenic amine that occurs to various degrees in many foods. In healthy persons, dietary histamine can be rapidly detoxified by amine oxidases, whereas persons with low amine oxidase activity are at risk of histamine toxicity. Diamine oxidase (DAO) is the main enzyme for the metabolism of ingested histamine. It has been proposed that DAO, when functioning as a secretory protein, may be responsible for scavenging extracellular histamine after mediator release. Conversely, histamine N-methyltransferase, the other important enzyme inactivating histamine, is a cytosolic protein that can convert histamine only in the intracellular space of cells. An impaired histamine degradation based on reduced DAO activity and the resulting histamine excess may cause numerous symptoms mimicking an allergic reaction. The ingestion of histamine-rich food or of alcohol or drugs that release histamine or block DAO may provoke diarrhea, headache, rhinoconjunctival symptoms, asthma, hypotension, arrhythmia, urticaria, pruritus, flushing, and other conditions in patients with histamine intolerance. Symptoms can be reduced by a histamine-free diet or be eliminated by antihistamines. However, because of the multifaceted nature of the symptoms, the existence of histamine intolerance has been underestimated, and further studies based on double-blind, placebo-controlled provocations are needed. In patients in whom the abovementioned symptoms are triggered by the corresponding substances and who have a negative diagnosis of allergy or internal disorders, histamine intolerance should be considered as an underlying pathomechanism.

### Allergy to mammalian meat linked to alpha-gal syndrome potentially after tick bite in the amazon: a case series [^112kecXP]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Between September 2017 and July 2019, 15 patients responded to the call for information; two patients did not follow up after the first contact, 2 patients had a clinical history that did not match the criteria (one patient had clinical manifestations episodically only during her pregnancy and one had clinical manifestations only with chicken meat). The demographic and historical characteristics of the patients are detailed in Table 2, the biological and historical continuous variables are described in Table 3, and the details of the allergological biological assessment are shown in Table 4. Eleven patients were included, with a male/female ratio of 0.46. All (11 of 11) patients were White from mainland France, with a median age of 38 years (IQR 33–39.5, range 30–54 years) (Tables 2 and 3). Specific patient details are reported in Table 5. Four patients declared preexisting lactose intolerance, three had local reactions to wasp stings, and one reported an allergy to penicillin. Only one patient (no. 2) has an atopic history with allergic asthma and atopic dermatitis. Nine patients were aware of their ABO grouping (six group A, three group O, and none were group B). Skin prick tests with mammalian meats were not performed in our study because they were not available; however, only one patient (no. 2) had negative pork skin prick.

The 11 patients included reported skin, respiratory, and/or digestive manifestations some hours after mammalian meat ingestion (Table 2). Most of the patients reported, abdominal pain, (n = 9, 82%), associated with diarrhea or vomiting for seven of them. Four of these 7 patients also reported skin symptoms, such as urticaria (3 patients) or angioedema (3 patients). One patient (no. 9) had only skin symptoms with hives and angioedema, and three patients had respiratory symptoms, such as dyspnea with hypoxemia requiring corticosteroid treatment.

### The diagnostic workup in chronic spontaneous urticaria-what to test and why [^111r7UA2]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

In chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), the guidelines recommend very limited diagnostic procedures during the routine workup, although additional investigations might be indicated in some patients with CSU. For physicians treating patients with CSU, it is often difficult to decide which diagnostic tests are useful.

Objective

To provide recommendations on what diagnostic tests should be performed on which patients with CSU.

Methods

We performed an extensive literature search on the respective topics and identified relevant questions that should prompt diagnostic procedures based on the published evidence and expert consensus among all authors.

Results

We provide questions, diagnostic testing, where appropriate, and recommendation that should be included when assessing the history of a patient with CSU, to explore and rule out differential diagnoses, to assess patients for underlying causes and modifying conditions, to explore patients for comorbid diseases and consequences of having CSU, and to assess patients for CSU components that can help to predict their disease course and response to treatment.

Conclusions

Here, we provide physicians treating patients with CSU with information about which clues should lead to which tests and why.

### Symptoms… [^114bP2XT]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Symptoms of alpha-gal syndrome may be mild or severe.
- They usually appear 2–6 hours after eating meat or dairy products.
- If you are having a severe allergic reaction, seek immediate emergency care. What to look out for AGS reactions can be different from person to person. They can range from mild to severe, and some may be life-threatening. People may not have the same allergic reaction after every exposure to products containing alpha-gal. Symptoms usually appear 2–6 hours after eating meat or dairy products. They also may appear after exposure to products containing alpha-gal. When to seek emergency care Seek immediate emergency careif you are having a severe allergic reaction or anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis is a potentially life-threatening allergic reaction involving multiple organ systems. AGS reactions can include:

- Hives or itchy rash
- Nausea or vomiting
- Severe stomach pain
- Heartburn or indigestion
- Diarrhea
- Cough, shortness of breath, or difficulty breathing
- Drop in blood pressure
- Swelling of the lips, throat, tongue, or eye lids
- Dizziness or faintness
- A combination of symptoms referred to as anaphylaxis.

### About norovirus… [^111K6eJC]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Norovirus is the leading cause of vomiting and diarrhea, and foodborne illness in the United States.
- People of all ages can get infected and sick with norovirus.
- Proper handwashing and other simple steps can help prevent getting and spreading norovirus. More Information. What it is Norovirus is a very contagious virus that causes vomiting and diarrhea. It is sometimes called the "stomach flu" or the "stomach bug. " However, norovirus illness is not related to the flu. The flu is caused by the influenza virus. Norovirus causes acute gastroenteritis, an inflammation of the stomach or intestines. Most people with norovirus illness get better within 1 to 3 days; but they can still spread the virus for a few days after. Keep Reading: Norovirus Facts and Stats. Dehydration If you have norovirus illness, you can feel extremely ill, and vomit or have diarrhea many times a day.

This can lead to dehydration, especially in young children, older adults, and people with other illnesses. Symptoms of dehydration include:

- Decreased urination
- Dry mouth and throat
- Feeling dizzy when standing up
- Crying with few or no tears
- Unusual sleepiness or fussiness. Who is at risk Anyone can get infected and sick with norovirus and people of all ages get infected during norovirus outbreaks. Your likelihood of getting a norovirus infection is also determined in part by your genes. If eaten raw, oysters and other filter-feeding shellfish can contain viruses and bacteria that can cause illness or death. Anyone who consumes raw shellfish is at risk of contracting norovirus. Children younger than 5 years old, older adults, and people with weakened immune systems are more likely to develop severe infections. How it spreads Norovirus spreads very easily and quickly in different ways.

You can get norovirus by: Having direct contact with someonewith norovirus, like caring for them, sharing food or eating utensils with them, or eating food handled by them. Eating food or drinking liquidsthat are contaminated with norovirus. Touching contaminated objects or surfacesand then putting your unwashed fingers in your mouth. You can still spread norovirus for 2 weeks or more after you feel better. Keep Reading: How Norovirus Spreads.
