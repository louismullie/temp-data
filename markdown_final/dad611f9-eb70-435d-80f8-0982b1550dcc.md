ocp prescription on 18 yo with smoking history

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a combined oral contraceptive pill (COC) can be prescribed for an 18-year-old who smokes, and what the risk-benefit analysis and alternatives should be. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the patient's age and how that affects eligibility. Then, I should verify the smoking-related risk stratification in the U.S. Medical Eligibility Criteria (US MEC). Next, I will review the specific cardiovascular risks and absolute versus relative contraindications. After that, I should weigh benefits versus risks in this exact scenario. Finally, I will consider counseling, monitoring, and alternative contraceptive options, and then synthesize a clear recommendation.

> Let me first confirm the age factor. At 18 years old, the patient is in the "age < 35 years" stratum for US MEC smoking categories, which is the key determinant for COC eligibility in smokers, and I should not conflate this with the ≥ 35-year-old rules that impose category 3 or 4 restrictions for COCs [^113EPmWG].

> Wait, let me verify the smoking-specific categorization. For smokers under 35, combined hormonal contraceptives are category 2, meaning they can generally be used with additional counseling and careful follow-up, whereas the category 3 and 4 designations apply only to women aged 35 and older who smoke, with the threshold of heavy smoking (≥ 15 cigarettes/day) pushing COCs to category 4 in that older group [^112BWBKw] [^113EPmWG].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I should confirm the nature of the risk. The main concern is an increased risk of serious cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, venous thromboembolism) that rises with age and with heavier smoking; in women under 35, the absolute risk remains low, but it is higher than in nonsmokers, which is why the category is 2 rather than 1 [^113EPmWG] [^116tkLtp].

> I need to check whether there are any absolute contraindications in this case. Absolute contraindications to COCs include age ≥ 35 years with smoking, migraine with aura, uncontrolled hypertension, history of venous thromboembolism or thrombophilia, and certain cardiovascular diseases; none of these are implied by "18-year-old smoker" alone, so an absolute contraindication is not present here [^112JRZc9] [^116YSeHW] [^113KsGz6].

> Next, I should review the risk-benefit balance. Benefits of COCs include highly effective contraception, cycle regulation, dysmenorrhea control, and acne improvement. In adolescents and young adults, these benefits often outweigh theoretical cardiovascular risks when no category 3 or 4 conditions are present, and the absolute VTE risk with modern low-dose COCs is about 3–9 per 10,000 woman-years, which remains lower than pregnancy-related VTE risk, though smoking modestly elevates it [^112Dh2HA] [^113p6YnK] [^116rXPUT].

> But wait, what if the patient is a very heavy smoker or has other risk factors? I should double-check for cumulative risks. If there are multiple risk factors (e.g., obesity, hypertension, strong family history of VTE), the aggregate thrombotic risk may reach an unacceptable level even under age 35, prompting consideration of non-estrogen methods; US MEC notes that two category 2 conditions do not automatically equal category 3, but clinical judgment is required [^1144uQFn] [^113KsGz6].

> I will now examine counseling and monitoring needs. I need to ensure smoking cessation counseling is offered, document smoking quantity, assess blood pressure, BMI, and migraine history, and reinforce adherence strategies; routine BP monitoring is prudent because COCs can cause a small but real BP increase in a minority of users, and adolescents benefit from structured adherence support and clear missed-pill instructions [^111mWbuA] [^112BWBKw] [^111QkezZ].

> Let me consider alternatives if the patient prefers to avoid estrogen or if additional risk factors emerge. Progestin-only methods (POP, implant, DMPA) and LARCs (LNG-IUD, copper IUD) are all category 1 for smokers of any age, including those under 35, and they avoid estrogen-related thrombotic risk; I should present these as safe, effective options, especially if smoking intensity is high or cessation is unlikely in the near term [^115buJKT] [^11721Cg3].

> Hmm, wait a minute — should I be worried about mortality data from FDA labeling tables showing excess deaths in older smokers on COCs? I should confirm that those mortality estimates pertain to women over 35 and often reflect older, higher-dose formulations; in women aged 15–39, mortality associated with COCs is generally lower than that associated with pregnancy, reinforcing that the age < 35 smoker without other major risk factors can reasonably use COCs with counseling [^112qwtA1] [^112LkY2o].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. Yes, a COC can be prescribed for an otherwise healthy 18-year-old who smokes, because smoking alone under age 35 places COCs in category 2, not an absolute contraindication. The prescription should be accompanied by smoking cessation support, screening for other cardiovascular risk factors, and a plan for follow-up, with consideration of progestin-only or LARC alternatives if additional risks are present or if the patient prefers a non-estrogen method [^113KsGz6] [^112Ek7DN] [^115buJKT].

In an 18-year-old smoker, **combined oral contraceptives (COCs) are not absolutely contraindicated** [^113KsGz6] but carry a **category 2 risk** due to increased cardiovascular risk, especially with heavy smoking (≥ 15 cigarettes/day) [^113EPmWG]. Progestin-only methods (POPs, implants, DMPA, IUDs) are **preferred** because they do not increase cardiovascular risk [^115buJKT] [^11721Cg3]. If COCs are used, prescribe the lowest effective estrogen dose, monitor blood pressure, and provide strong smoking cessation counseling. Avoid COCs if the patient has additional risk factors (e.g. hypertension, migraine with aura, thrombophilia) [^112BWBKw] [^1144uQFn].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

The U.S. Medical Eligibility Criteria (US MEC) provide clear guidance on **COC use in smokers** [^113KsGz6]:

- **Age < 35 years**: Smoking is category 2 (generally use with caution) [^112Ek7DN].
- **Age ≥ 35 years, < 15 cigarettes/day**: Category 3 (generally do not use unless other methods are unacceptable) [^112JRZc9].
- **Age ≥ 35 years, ≥ 15 cigarettes/day**: Category 4 (contraindicated) [^113EPmWG].

Thus, in an 18-year-old smoker, COCs are **not absolutely contraindicated** but require **careful risk assessment and counseling** [^113KsGz6].

---

## Cardiovascular risks associated with smoking and COCs

Smoking independently increases the risk of cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke, venous thromboembolism) [^notfound], and combined oral contraceptives further increase this risk, particularly with higher estrogen doses and heavy smoking [^113EPmWG]. The **absolute risk remains low in young women**, but it rises with age and cigarette consumption [^113EPmWG].

---

## Alternative contraceptive options

Given the elevated cardiovascular risk associated with COCs in smokers, **alternative contraceptive methods** are recommended:

| **Contraceptive method** | **Cardiovascular risk in smokers** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|-|
| Progestin-only pills (POPs) | No significant increase in cardiovascular risk | Category 1 (safe) [^115buJKT] |
| Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) | No significant increase in cardiovascular risk | Category 1 (safe) [^115buJKT] |
| Implants (etonogestrel) | No significant increase in cardiovascular risk | Category 1 (safe) [^115buJKT] |
| Intrauterine devices (IUDs) | No significant increase in cardiovascular risk | Category 1 (safe) [^11721Cg3] |
| Combined oral contraceptives (COCs) | Increased cardiovascular risk, especially with heavy smoking | Category 2 (use with caution) [^notfound] |

---

Progestin-only methods and IUDs are **preferred** for smokers because they do not significantly increase cardiovascular risk [^113KsGz6].

---

## Clinical management and counseling

If COCs are prescribed to an 18-year-old smoker, the following clinical management and counseling steps are **recommended**:

- **Screening**: Assess smoking history, blood pressure, and other cardiovascular risk factors (e.g. hypertension, migraine with aura, thrombophilia) [^111mWbuA].
- **Lowest effective dose**: Prescribe the lowest effective estrogen dose (e.g. 20 µg ethinyl estradiol) to minimize cardiovascular risk [^112tuZMT].
- **Smoking cessation counseling**: Provide strong counseling and support for smoking cessation [^112PsB9U].
- **Regular monitoring**: Monitor blood pressure and cardiovascular health regularly during COC use [^114WZx1W].
- **Patient education**: Educate the patient about the increased cardiovascular risks associated with smoking and COC use, and discuss alternative contraceptive options [^112BWBKw].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

In an 18-year-old smoker, COCs are **not absolutely contraindicated** but carry a **category 2 risk** due to increased cardiovascular risk, especially with heavy smoking [^113KsGz6]. Progestin-only methods or IUDs are **preferred** because they do not increase cardiovascular risk [^116tkLtp]. If COCs are prescribed, use the lowest effective estrogen dose, monitor blood pressure, and provide strong smoking cessation counseling. Avoid COCs if the patient has additional risk factors such as hypertension, migraine with aura, or thrombophilia [^1144uQFn].

WARNING: CIGARETTE SMOKING AND SERIOUS CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS

Cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious cardiovascular events from combination oral contraceptives (COC) use. This risk increases with age, particularly in women over 35 years of age, and with the number of cigarettes smoked. For this reason, COCs should not be used by women who are over 35 years of age and smoke [see Contraindications (4)].

Sensitivity analyses

We did not have information about potential confounders such as obesity, smoking, and parity for the national dataset; therefore, we conducted sensitivity analyses to assess the likely effects on our results. We first restricted analyses to women in Western Australia, where we had additional hospital morbidity information (99% of case individuals and 98% of control individuals had a hospital record) and could exclude those individuals who had undergone hysterectomy or oophorectomy (where necessary) and additionally adjusted for smoking and parity (Table S4). We then used PBS data to predict obesityto assess confounding in the concessional subcohort (Supplementary Methods). We used quantitative bias analysisto quantify the potential bias for underreporting of smoking status in hospital records.

Because we did not have information about depot-medroxyprogesterone acetate or oral contraceptive pill use before July 2002, we also conducted sensitivity analyses for breast cancer, first excluding women aged 45 to 54 years on July 1, 2002, because they would be most likely to be former contraceptive users and second, commencing follow-up in 2008 to ensure that we had a minimum of 6 years of prescribing history for all women. In a final sensitivity analysis, we compared exclusive use of each contraceptive with no use of any long-acting, reversible contraceptives or oral contraceptive pill as the reference group.

L.1 Current considerations — The 2019 guidelines are designed to take into account factors that influence Clinical Action Thresholds, with screening history profoundly influencing risk estimates, specifically current HPV and cytology test results, previous HPV test results, and history of histologic HSIL; unknown history is considered separately as a risk factor. Additional factors considered because of associations with cervical cancer include HPV vaccination, age, hormonal contraception use, history of sexually transmitted infection, parity, cigarette smoking, obesity, and sexual behaviors including age of first intercourse and multiple partners. HPV vaccination at adolescence (generally before the age of 18 years) does seem to reduce the risk of HPV 16/18 infections and associated histologic HSIL, although HPV vaccination status was omitted from this version of the guidelines.

### Sex and gender in hypertension guidelines [^114WZx1W]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

This guideline also addressed the issue that combined estrogen–progesterone oral contraceptive pills can be associated with a small but significant increase in BP and the development of hypertension in about 5% of users. BP usually decreases promptly following cessation of these pills; consequently, BP should be monitored before and during oral contraceptive treatment. The 2018 ESC/ESH guideline also acknowledges that older studies have demonstrated a relationship between oral contraceptive pills and venous thrombosis or thromboembolism and, to a lesser extent, myocardial infarction (especially with concomitant smoking history) and stroke. More recent studies with newer-generation oral contraceptive pills reported conflicting results. Thus, physicians prescribing oral contraceptives should consider the individual patient's risks and benefits. Finally, hormone-replacement therapy and selective estrogen receptor modulators should not be used for primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease, while there is no convincing evidence for a significant BP rise in menopausal women due to hormone replacement therapy.

ESC/ESH 2018 — oral contraceptive pills and hypertension: Combined oestrogen–progestogen oral contraceptive pills can be associated with a small but significant increase in BP and the development of hypertension in about 5% of OC users. BP should be monitored before and during oral contraceptive pill treatment. Concomitant CV risk factors (e.g. smoking history) should be assessed and oral contraceptive pill use is not recommended if BP is elevated. Discontinuation of combined oestrogen–progestogen oral contraceptives in women with hypertension may improve their BP control.

### Combined hormonal contraception and the risk of venous thromboembolism: a guideline [^116rXPUT]. Fertility and Sterility (2017). Medium credibility.

Combined hormonal contraception (CHC) users — risk modifiers for venous thromboembolism (VTE) and screening guidance include multiple patient factors and peripartum timing. Reported risk factors include prolonged immobilization, age over 35 years, increased body mass index in patients over 35 years, personal history of VTE, family history of deep vein thrombosis, inherited thrombophilia (factor V Leiden or prothrombin G20210A), antiphospholipid syndrome, active systemic lupus, and current cancer diagnosis, but none increases risk more than pregnancy (5–20/10,000 woman-years); postpartum risk is greatest for 6 weeks (approximately 40–65 per 10,000 woman-years) and is increased until 12 weeks. Among women with thrombophilia, developing deep vein thrombosis during the first 6 months of oral contraceptive use was increased 19-fold (95% CI, 1.9–175.7), and in the first year it was increased 11-fold (95% CI, 2.1–57.3). Given the rarity of fatal VTE, screening more than 1 million CHC candidates for thrombophilia would at best prevent two oral contraceptive-associated deaths, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not recommend screening for thrombophilias with laboratory testing during routine care. Additional associated factors include smoking (particularly more than 15 cigarettes daily) and obesity, with some studies revealing up to a 10-fold increased risk of VTE among obese oral contraceptive users compared with non-users, and the risk increases substantially if women are over age 35 years and smoke.

### Desogestrel and ethinyl estradiol (cyred EQ) [^117TnNDf]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

BRIEF SUMMARY PATIENT PACKAGE INSERT

Cyred EQ (Desogestrel and Ethinyl Estradiol Tablets USP) This product (like all oral contraceptives) is intended to prevent pregnancy. It does not protect against HIV infection (AIDS) and other sexually transmitted diseases.

Oral contraceptives, also known as "birth control pills" or "the pill", are taken to prevent pregnancy, and when taken correctly without missing any pills, have a failure rate of approximately 1% per year. The typical failure rate is approximately 5% per year when women who miss pills are included. For most women, oral contraceptives are also free of serious or unpleasant side effects. However, forgetting to take pills considerably increases the chances of pregnancy.

For the majority of women, oral contraceptives can be taken safely. But there are some women who are at high risk of developing certain serious diseases that can be life-threatening or may cause temporary or permanent disability. The risks associated with taking oral contraceptives increase significantly if you:

smoke
have high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol
have or have had clotting disorders, heart attack, stroke, angina pectoris, cancer of the breast or sex organs, jaundice or malignant or benign liver tumors

Although cardiovascular disease risks may be increased with oral contraceptive use after age 40 in healthy, non-smoking women (even with the newer low-dose formulations), there are also greater potential health risks associated with pregnancy in older women.

You should not take the pill if you suspect you are pregnant or have unexplained vaginal bleeding.

Do not use Cyred EQ if you smoke cigarettes and are over 35 years old. Smoking increases your risk of serious cardiovascular side effects (heart and blood vessel problems) from combination oral contraceptives, including death from heart attack, blood clots or stroke. This risk increases with age and the number of cigarettes you smoke.

### Smoking cessation interventions… [^112C7Prs]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

2 Although smokers traditionally start NRT on their quit date, some evidence supports increased abstinence rates if NRT is started before the quit date. 4, 9 Patients taking any form of NRT are 55% more likely to sustain smoking cessation for at least six months compared with placebo or no NRT. 17 Using a combination of long- and short-acting NRTs increases the quit rate by 25% over a single form and is recommended for all nonpregnant adult smokers, especially heavy smokers. 6, 13, 18. 2, 4, 14, 15, 19 Bupropion is associated with a 64% higher likelihood of sustained smoking cessation compared with placebo or no pharmacotherapy, which is similar to the effectiveness of NRT. 4, 19 There is insufficient evidence to indicate whether the combination of bupropion and NRT is more effective than NRT alone.
19. The ATS strongly recommends varenicline over bupropion and NRT.

9 The ATS also conditionally recommends using varenicline plus a nicotine patch over varenicline alone, noting a 36% increase in sustained cessation rates and an NNT of 10 for six-month abstinence compared with varenicline alone. However, a 2021 randomized controlled trial did not show any difference between combining the nicotine patch with varenicline and using varenicline alone. 16 There are no studies evaluating the combination of varenicline and short-acting NRTs. 9 Evidence is insufficient to recommend the combination of bupropion and varenicline.
19. ADOLESCENTS Adolescence is the primary time when people start smoking, and experimentation can turn to dependence. The USPSTF and AAFP recommend interventions to prevent the initiation of smoking in school-aged children and adolescents.

51, 52 Behavior interventions in the form of print materials or telephone, internet-based, or interactive computer support decrease smoking initiation in adolescents but do not increase smoking cessation. 51 Trials assessing behavior interventions for smoking cessation in adolescents are limited by a low number of participants. Pharmacologic interventions are not recommended because of insufficient evidence in this population.
51. Lung Cancer Screening The USPSTF recommends annual lung cancer screening with low-dose computed tomography for adults 50 to 80 years of age who have a 20-pack-year smoking history and currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years.

### Contraception choices in women with underlying medical conditions [^113gH8a8]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Primary care physicians often prescribe contraceptives to women of reproductive age with comorbidities. Novel delivery systems (e.g., contraceptive patch, contraceptive ring, single-rod implantable device) may change traditional risk and benefit profiles in women with comorbidities. Effective contraceptive counseling requires an understanding of a woman's preferences and medical history, as well as the risks, benefits, adverse effects, and contraindications of each method. Noncontraceptive benefits of combined hormonal contraceptives, such as oral contraceptive pills, include regulated menses, decreased dysmenorrhea, and diminished premenstrual dysphoric disorder. Oral contraceptive pills may be used safely in women with a range of medical conditions, including well-controlled hypertension, uncomplicated diabetes mellitus, depression, and uncomplicated valvular heart disease. However, women older than 35 years who smoke should avoid oral contraceptive pills. Contraceptives containing estrogen, which can increase thrombotic risk, should be avoided in women with a history of venous thromboembolism, stroke, cardiovascular disease, or peripheral vascular disease. Progestin-only contraceptives are recommended for women with contraindications to estrogen. Depo-Provera, a long-acting injectable contraceptive, may be preferred in women with sickle cell disease because it reduces the frequency of painful crises. Because of the interaction between antiepileptics and oral contraceptive pills, Depo-Provera may also be considered in women with epilepsy. Implanon, the single-rod implantable contraceptive device, may reduce symptoms of dysmenorrhea. Mirena, the levonorgestrel-containing intrauterine contraceptive system, is an option for women with menorrhagia, endometriosis, or chronic pelvic pain.

### Society of Family Planning committee statement: contraceptive considerations for individuals with cancer and cancer survivors part 1-key considerations for clinical care joint with the Society of Gynecologic Oncology [^111pt8iy]. Contraception (2025). High credibility.

Skin cancer and hormonal contraception — For individuals with a history of nonmelanoma skin cancer, we recommend clinicians provide access to all available contraceptive methods utilizing a person-centered approach (GRADE 1B). Based on expert opinion, for individuals with a history of melanoma who are considering hormonal contraception, we suggest shared decision-making with the individual and their oncologist (GRADE 2C). Updated meta-analyses show that those with 5 or more years of oral contraception use had a risk ratio (RR) of 1.18 (95% CI 1.07–1.31), while 10 years or more had a RR of 1.25 (95% CI 1.06–1.48), and overall, hormone exposure or pregnancy-associated melanoma has not been associated with a poorer prognosis.

### The effect of oral contraceptive pills on the macula, the retinal nerve fiber layer, the ganglion cell layer and the choroidal thickness [^1169dgET]. BMC Ophthalmology (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

We conclude that women who are using OCP for more than 1 year could develop some eye problems which could involve the central vision. We also think that using OCP with different preparations could give different results. Further long term studies are required using different preparations of combined oral contraceptive pills (COC) or progestin-only contraceptive pills (POC) to find out what are the consequences of these changes when these thickness alterations can be clinically significant or symptomatic and if these changes are reversible or not. OCT should be routinely done for follow up these cases. According to these findings, physicians should take into consideration patients ocular history, before selecting the method of contraception and before prescribing OCP for reasons other than contraception.

### Contraception for adolescents… [^112BWBKw]. publications.aap.org (2014). Low credibility.

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act specifically addresses minor confidentiality. Although HIPAA allows parents access to a minor's records as personal representatives, that access is denied when the minor is provided with confidentiality under state or other laws or when the parent agrees that the minor may have confidential care. Sexual History Taking and Counseling Bright Futures recommends that pediatricians take a developmentally targeted sexual history, assess STI and pregnancy risk, and provide appropriate screening, counseling, and, if needed, contraceptives. 24 Key to history taking is an honest, caring, nonjudgmental attitude and a comfortable, matter-of-fact approach to asking questions.

This can be accomplished by assessing the 5 Ps of sexual history taking, as described by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: partners, prevention of pregnancy, protection from STIs, sexual practices, and past history of STIs and pregnancy. The CDC recommends prescribing up to 1 year of COCs at a time. 52 Additionally, a routine follow-up visit 1 to 3 months after initiating COCs is useful for addressing adverse effects or adherence issues. COCs have few contraindications in healthy female adolescents. They should not be prescribed for patients with severe and uncontrolled hypertension, ongoing hepatic dysfunction, complicated valvular heart disease, migraines with aura or focal neurologic symptoms, thromboembolism or thrombophilia, complications of diabetes, and complicated solid organ transplantation.

94, 95 Although smoking should be discouraged, it is not a contraindication to COC use in teenagers and adults younger than 35 years old. 37 Patients should be informed that common transient adverse effects of COCs include irregular bleeding, headache, and nausea. Recommendations for managing adverse effects have been published elsewhere. 32, 98 Counseling should include strategies to promote daily adherence, such as cell phone alarms and support from a family member or partner. Patients should be instructed on what to do if pills are missed. A missed pill should be taken as soon as it is remembered. If more than 1 pill in a row is missed, only the most recently missed pill should be taken as soon as possible, and the remaining pills should be taken at the usual time.

### Norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol (nylia 1 / 35) [^112tuZMT]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

Minimizing exposure to estrogen and progestogen is in keeping with good principles of therapeutics. For any particular estrogen/progestogen combination, the dosage regimen prescribed should be one which contains the least amount of estrogen and progestogen that is compatible with a low failure rate and the needs of the individual patient. New acceptors of oral contraceptive agents should be started on preparations containing the lowest estrogen content which is judged appropriate for the individual patient.

e. Persistence of risk of vascular disease

There are two studies which have shown persistence of risk of vascular disease for ever-users of oral contraceptives. In a study in the United States, the risk of developing myocardial infarction after discontinuing oral contraceptives persists for at least 9 years for women 40 to 49 years who had used oral contraceptives for five or more years, but this increased risk was not demonstrated in other age groups.8In another study in Great Britain, the risk of developing cerebrovascular disease persisted for at least 6 years after discontinuation of oral contraceptives, although excess risk was very small.34However, both studies were performed with oral contraceptive formulations containing 50 micrograms or higher of estrogens.

2. Estimates of Mortality from Contraceptive Use

One study gathered data from a variety of sources which have estimated the mortality rate associated with different methods of contraception at different ages (Table 2). These estimates include the combined risk of death associated with contraceptive methods plus the risk attributable to pregnancy in the event of method failure. Each method of contraception has its specific benefits and risks. The study concluded that with the exception of oral contraceptive users 35 and older who smoke, and 40 and older who do not smoke, mortality associated with all methods of birth control is low and below that associated with childbirth. The observation of an increase in risk of mortality with age for oral contraceptive users is based on data gathered in the 1970's.35Current clinical recommendation involves the use of lower estrogen dose formulations and a careful consideration of risk factors. In 1989, the Fertility and Maternal Health Drugs Advisory Committee was asked to review the use of oral contraceptives in women 40 years of age and over. The Committee concluded that although cardiovascular disease risks may be increased with oral contraceptive use after age 40 in healthy non-smoking women (even with the newer low-dose formulations), there are also greater potential health risks associated with pregnancy in older women and with the alternative surgical and medical procedures which may be necessary if such women do not have access to effective and acceptable means of contraception. The Committee recommended that the benefits of low-dose oral contraceptive use by healthy non-smoking women over 40 may outweigh the possible risks.

Oral contraceptives, also known as "birth control pills" or "the pill", are taken to prevent pregnancy and when taken correctly without missing any pills, have a failure rate of approximately 1% per year. The typical failure rate is approximately 5% per year when women who miss pills are included. For most women oral contraceptives are also free of serious or unpleasant side effects. However, forgetting to take pills considerably increases the chances of pregnancy.

For the majority of women, oral contraceptives can be taken safely. But there are some women who are at high risk of developing certain serious diseases that can be fatal or may cause temporary or permanent disability. The risks associated with taking oral contraceptives increase significantly if you:

smoke
have high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol
have or have had clotting disorders, heart attack, stroke, angina pectoris, cancer of the breast or sex organs, jaundice or malignant or benign liver tumors.

Although cardiovascular disease risks may be increased with oral contraceptive use after age 40 in healthy, non-smoking women (even with the newer low-dose formulations), there are also greater potential health risks associated with pregnancy in older women.

You should not take the pill if you suspect you are pregnant or have unexplained vaginal bleeding.

Do not use Cyclafem™ 7/7/7 (norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol tablets USP) if you smoke cigarettes and are over 35 years old. Smoking increases your risk of serious cardiovascular side effects (heart and blood vessel problems) from combination oral contraceptives, including death from heart attack, blood clots or stroke. This risk increases with age and the number of cigarettes you smoke.

### Improving combined contraceptive pill / oral contraceptives prescribing in general practice [^111QkezZ]. BMJ Open Quality (2017). Medium credibility.

Strategy

Our SMART (specific, measureable, achievable, realistic and timely) aim was to improve the safety of COCP prescribing to 100% adherence with UKMEC criteria, and increase compliance with NICE and FSRH guidance such that at least 80% of consultations discussed LARC options, provided missed pill advice and risk assessed for STIs. UKMEC criteria entail a long list of medical conditions and lifestyle factors. The project team elected to analyse and improve upon documentation of the three most variable UKMEC criteria: BP, smoking status and BMI. This was decided in the knowledge that the EMIS computer system would provide the practitioner with an up-to-date medical history for each patient (ie, would capture criteria such as breast cancer, history of VTE, and so on, anyway). We undertook three PDSA (plan, do, study, act) test cycles.

PDSA cycle 1: Our initial intervention was to hold a teaching session for all key stakeholders. This session provided team members with our baseline results, outlined all national guidance on COCP prescribing and highlighted cases where UKMEC guidance had not been followed in the preceding 3-month period. Staff were educated on local demographics in the hope that this may fuel a desire to promote safe sex, regularly assess for STI risk and use local LARC options. Presentation of baseline results revealed that general practitioners viewed COCP consultations as quick appointments and often considered them an opportunity to make up clinic time rather than promote safe sex. Discussion highlighted that practitioners were not all aware of UKMEC criteria, and many did not realise that they needed to continue to perform a basic assessment at subsequent pill checks (ie, repeat BP and BMI to ensure that UKMEC eligibility was unchanged). It was observed that general practitioners often presumed their patients to be at low risk of STIs, without any history to support that assumption. Feedback from general practitioners highlighted that time restraints were of the utmost concern.

Using U.S. MEC categories in practice — category definitions and example: Health care providers can use the eligibility categories when assessing the safety of contraceptive method use for persons with certain characteristics or medical conditions. Category 1 comprises conditions for which no restrictions exist for use of the contraceptive method, but category 1 does not imply that the method is the most appropriate choice for a person. Classification as category 2 indicates the method generally can be used, with additional discussion about risks and benefits, and careful follow-up might be required. For category 3, use of that method usually is not recommended unless other more appropriate methods are not available or acceptable, the severity of the condition and the availability, practicality, and acceptability of alternative methods should be considered, and careful follow-up is required; provision requires careful clinical judgment and might warrant additional counseling, consultation, or follow-up. Category 4 comprises conditions that represent an unacceptable health risk if the method is used. For example, a person who smokes and is aged < 35 years generally can use COCs (category 2).

### Oral contraceptive tolerance: does the type of pill matter? [^114LsuqY]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the frequencies of reported symptoms by oral contraceptive pill (OCP) composition among French women.

Methods

A population-based cohort of 2,863 women studied between 2000 and 2004 was used to compare the frequency of reported symptoms (weight gain, nausea, breast tenderness, lower frequency of menstrual periods, breakthrough bleeding, painful and heavy periods, swollen legs) by type of OCPs (classified by estrogen dosage, progestin component, and sequence of administration).

Results

Results show little variation in the frequency of symptoms by type of OCPs, with the exception of progestin-only pills being associated with higher frequencies of breakthrough bleeding and lower frequencies of menstrual periods. We found no decrease in the reporting of symptoms with the reduction of estrogen dosage, nor with the use of third-generation OCPs compared with second-generation OCPs. Likewise, we found little variation by sequence of administration of OCPs (monophasic versus triphasic).

Conclusion

In the absence of sufficient evidence-based data to support the existence of differences in the tolerance profile of low-dose combined OCPs, future well-designed randomized trials are needed to guide providers in their choice of OCPs. However, research should also assess the effectiveness of counseling on the tolerance of OCPs, an intervention that may prove to be more rewarding than basing the choice of OCPs on their theoretical properties.

### Approach to the patient: contraception in women with polycystic ovary syndrome [^115kDTyM]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common reproductive and metabolic disorder. Patients with PCOS present with clinical signs of androgen excess (ie, hirsutism and acne), menstrual irregularities, and infertility. Combined oral contraceptive (OC) pills are the first-line medical therapy for the long-term management of PCOS. Containing a combination of estrogen and progestin, OCs restore regular menses, improve androgen excess, and provide effective contraception and protection from endometrial cancer. The benefits of hormonal contraception outweigh the risks in the vast majority of women with PCOS. However, concerns have been raised about potential adverse cardiovascular and metabolic effects of OCs. Currently available evidence indicates an increased relative risk of venous thrombosis associated with OCs varying among different formulations. Arterial thrombosis risk attributable to OCs does not appear to be significantly increased in young nonsmoking women. OC use might be associated with increased risk of diabetes in morbidly obese women with PCOS with severe insulin resistance. A tailored clinical approach to oral contraception in women with PCOS requires individualized risk stratification and management by determination of each PCOS patient's personal cardiometabolic risk profile at baseline and during follow-up. Before prescribing an OC, clinicians should document individual risk factors including age, smoking, obesity, any degree of glucose intolerance including prediabetes and diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, thrombophilia, and personal or family history of a venous thromboembolic event.

### Levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol and ethinyl estradiol (Lo simpesse) [^111SerSU]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Lo Simpesse is contraindicated in women over 35 years of age who smoke [see Contraindications (4)]. Cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious cardiovascular events from COC use. This risk increases with age, particularly in women over 35 years of age, and with the number of cigarettes smoked.

Venous Events

Use of COCs increases the risk of venous thromboembolic events (VTEs), such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Risk factors for VTEs include smoking, obesity, and family history of VTE, in addition to other factors that contraindicate use of COCs [see Contraindications (4)]. While the increased risk of VTE associated with use of COCs is well-established, the rates of VTE are even greater during pregnancy, and especially during the postpartum period (see Figure 1). The rate of VTE in females using COCs has been estimated to be 3 to 9 cases per 10,000 woman years.

The risk of VTE is highest during the first year of use of a COC and when restarting hormonal contraception after a break of four weeks or longer. The risk of thromboembolic disease due to COCs gradually disappears after COC use is discontinued.

Figure 1 shows the risk of developing a VTE for females who are not pregnant and do not use oral contraceptives, for females who use oral contraceptives, and for females in the postpartum period. To put the risk of developing a VTE into perspective: If 10,000 females who are not pregnant and do not use oral contraceptives are followed for one year, between 1 and 5 of these females will develop a VTE.

Use of Lo Simpesse provides females with more hormonal exposure on a yearly basis than conventional monthly oral contraceptives containing the same strength synthetic estrogens and progestins (an additional 9 and 13 weeks of exposure to progestin and estrogen, respectively, per year).

### Use of combined oral contraceptives and risk of venous thromboembolism: nested case-control studies using the QResearch and CPRD databases [^113htDp2]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

About 9% of women of reproductive age worldwide use oral contraceptives. This percentage rises to 18% of women in developed countries and 28% of women in the United Kingdom. Combined oral contraceptives form a substantial proportion of these, particularly in more developed nations. Although combined oral contraceptives are generally effective in preventing pregnancy, they have measurable side effects such as venous thromboembolism (VTE). VTE is important, not only because of the prolonged time over which women might be exposed to such contraceptives, but also because VTEs are potentially avoidable and can be fatal.

Previous studies have shown varying risks for different types of oral contraceptives (such as third generation pills compared with first or second generation pills), but such studies were done some years ago, and tended not to include new preparations containing drospirenone. Also, previous studies have generally had insufficient power to analyse the risks for more recent formulationssuch as norgestimate. Few studies — only four of those referenced here — have included any detailed analyses of dosage and, of these, only Lidegaard and colleagueshave covered a full range of prescribed drugs. Some studies did not control for all potential confounders (such as body mass index or smoking), while others analysed only healthy users. Different methodological approaches in studies have also made it difficult to compare and combine the results. Therefore, although the increased VTE risk associated with combined oral contraceptive drugs is established, the relative risks associated with different combinations remain inconclusive, especially for newer formulations.

### Contraception for adolescents with lupus [^114WJ4YK]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Despite the completion of several well-designed studies, the safety profile of estrogen-containing oral contraceptives in women with lupus is not clear. Sanchez-Guerrero et al, in a 2005 study, randomly assigned 162 Mexican women with SLE to combined oral contraceptives, a progestin-only pill, or a copper IUD. Women with highly active disease (SLEDAI > 30) at baseline or a history of thrombosis were excluded. Interestingly, women with positive antiphospholipid antibodies and smokers (except women over 35 who smoked > 15 cigarettes/day) were included. The investigators found no significant differences between groups in incidence of flares or global disease activity. There were four occurrences of serious thromboses, two each in the OCPs and progestin-only groups, all in women with low-titer positive antiphospholipid antibodies. While these data suggest that OCPs are safe for at least some patients with SLE, this study was limited by the large number of patients excluded (of 1981 patients screened, 1533 did not meet inclusion criteria), as well as by the inclusion of only one ethnic group. Also in 2005, the SELENA-OC study, a multicenter randomized, placebo-controlled trial of combined oral contraceptives in 183 women with lupus, showed no significant difference in disease activity over one year. This study included patients with inactive or stable disease, and excluded women with hypertension, those requiring high (> 0.5 mg/kg/day) oral steroids, and those with evidence of antiphospholipid antibodies (lupus anticoagulant or high-titer anticardiolipins), among others. Disease flares and serious complications including thrombosis and infection were similar between groups. The SELENA-OC study results are reassuring regarding safety of OCPs for a subgroup of women with SLE who are normotensive with mild, stable disease and no known thrombotic risk factors, but again, relatively few women with SLE meet these conditions. Studies of exogenous estrogens in women with severe SLE with major organ involvement have not been performed.

### Smoking and oral contraceptive continuation [^111rGNcT]. Contraception (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Smoking may be related to early discontinuation of oral contraceptives (OC).

Study Design

This was a planned secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial. Women aged less than 25 initiating OC at three inner-city publicly funded family planning clinics enrolled in the study. Subjects reported smoking status at enrollment; 3- and 6-month interviews assessed OC continuation.

Results

One hundred eighty-nine (12%) of 1598 participants were current smokers. Smokers were more often lost to follow-up than nonsmokers (P < .01). Among participants with a 6-month interview, only 26% of smokers and 46% of nonsmokers were continuing OC (P < .001). After adjustment for confounding factors, smokers were still somewhat less likely to be continuing OC (adjusted OR 0.6, 95% CI 0.4–1.0). This association was unrelated to number of cigarettes smoked per day.

Conclusions

These data suggest that young smokers may be more likely to discontinue OC within 6 months than nonsmokers. Smoking may be a marker for risk-taking behavior that extends to the premature discontinuation of OC.

### Over-the-counter oral contraceptive use and initiation of contraception [^113EC1j3]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

In 2023, the US Food and Drug Administration approved the first over-the-counter (OTC) birth control pill for use in the US. Oral contraceptive pills (OCP), both progestin-only and combined, are safe, effective, and easy to use — all qualities that have made them good candidates for consideration of OTC status. More importantly, OTC availability is one way to improve contraceptive access by removing barriers to initiation, continuation, and adherence or correct use, all of which may aid in decreasing the rate of unintended pregnancy.

In the US, OCPs are the most common form of reversible contraception used. Almost 80% of US reproductive aged female individuals who ever had sexual intercourse with a male partner have used a birth control pill in their lifetime. Globally, OTC OCPs are currently available in more than 100 countries, some with access for over 50 years. Data from global use and recent actual use clinical studies in the US show that consumers can easily self-screen and use progestin-only contraceptive pills.

The OTC OCP became widely available to buy in stores and online in April of 2024. This availability became notably important as possible threats to Title X and Medicare by the Trump administration have the potential to limit the accessibility of prescribed contraceptive methods. The uninsured and those living in areas with limited access to health centers may be disproportionately affected, further increasing their barriers to contraceptive information and services.

We sought to evaluate whether the OTC OCP is associated with improved access for individuals who desire to avoid pregnancy with structural barriers to care, such as adolescents, those living in rural areas, and uninsured individuals. The objective of our study was to evaluate whether the new availability of an OTC OCP was reaching people who had either not previously been contracepting or were using a less-effective method of contraception.

### The effect of pack supply on oral contraceptive pill continuation: a randomized controlled trial [^113fS6wJ]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

The often small number of oral contraceptive pill (OCP) cycles provided may contribute to high rates of discontinuation. We examined the effect of an increased OCP supply on 6-month continuation rates.

Methods

This was a randomized trial of women initiating OCP use at an urban family-planning clinic (n = 700). All participants were randomized to receive three or seven cycles of OCPs. Participants younger than age 18 years or uninsured received their entire supply as packs; those older than age 18 years with insurance were additionally randomized to receive either packs or a prescription for refills. We contacted participants by telephone 6 months after enrollment to assess OCP continuation and adverse events.

Results

We obtained follow-up information from 76% of participants (260 of 342 in the three-pack group, 244 of 319 in the seven-pack group). Participants who received seven packs had higher 6-month continuation than participants who received three packs (51% compared with 35%, P < .001). The treatment effect was greater among participants younger than 18 years of age (49% compared with 12%, P < .001) than among those aged 18 years and older (52% compared with 40%, P = 0.018). Participants who received a prescription were less likely to continue OCP use than those who received packs (42% compared with 21%, P = 0.027). Adverse events in the study were rare and not associated with receiving more OCP packs.

Conclusion

A greater OCP supply at the time of initiation can improve continuation rates, especially among women younger than 18 years of age.

INTRODUCTION

Any woman who considers using oral contraceptives (the birth control pill or the pill) should understand the benefits and risks of using this form of birth control. This patient labeling will give you much of the information you will need to make this decision and will also help you determine if you are at risk of developing any of the serious side effects of the pill. It will tell you how to use the pill properly so that it will be as effective as possible. However, this labeling is not a replacement for a careful discussion between you and your health care provider. You should discuss the information provided in this labeling with him or her, both when you first start taking the pill and during your revisits. You should also follow your health care provider's advice with regard to regular check-ups while you are on the pill.

EFFECTIVENESS OF ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES

Oral contraceptives or "birth control pills" or "the pill" are used to prevent pregnancy and are more effective than other non-surgical methods of birth control. When they are taken correctly, the chance of becoming pregnant is less than 1% (1 pregnancy per 100 women per year of use) when used perfectly, without missing any pills. Typical failure rates are actually 3% per year. The chance of becoming pregnant increases with each missed pill during a menstrual cycle.

In comparison, typical failure rates for other nonsurgical methods of birth control during the first year of use are as follows:

Implant: < 1%

Injection: < 1%

IUD: 1 to 2%

Diaphragm with spermicides: 18%

Spermicides alone: 21%

Vaginal sponge: 18 to 36%

Cervical Cap: 18 to 36%

Condom alone (male): 12%

Condom alone (female): 21%

Periodic abstinence: 20%

No methods: 85%

WHO SHOULD NOT TAKE ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES

Cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious cardiovascular side effects from oral contraceptive use. This risk increases with age and with heavy smoking (15 or more cigarettes per day) and is quite marked in women over 35 years of age. Women who use oral contraceptives are strongly advised not to smoke.

### Levonorgestrel / ethinyl estradiol and ethinyl estradiol (loJaimiess) [^115hZdZd]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

LoJaimiess is contraindicated in women over 35 years of age who smoke [see Contraindications (4)]. Cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious cardiovascular events from COC use. This risk increases with age, particularly in women over 35 years of age, and with the number of cigarettes smoked.

Venous Events

Use of COCs increases the risk of venous thromboembolic events (VTEs), such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Risk factors for VTEs include smoking, obesity, and family history of VTE, in addition to other factors that contraindicate use of COCs [see Contraindications (4)]. While the increased risk of VTE associated with use of COCs is well-established, the rates of VTE are even greater during pregnancy, and especially during the postpartum period (see Figure 1). The rate of VTE in females using COCs has been estimated to be 3 to 9 cases per 10,000 woman years.

The risk of VTE is highest during the first year of use of a COC and when restarting hormonal contraception after a break of four weeks or longer. The risk of thromboembolic disease due to COCs gradually disappears after COC use is discontinued.

Figure 1 shows the risk of developing a VTE for females who are not pregnant and do not use oral contraceptives, for females who use oral contraceptives, and for females in the postpartum period. To put the risk of developing a VTE into perspective: If 10,000 females who are not pregnant and do not use oral contraceptives are followed for one year, between 1 and 5 of these females will develop a VTE.

### Cancers attributable to exposure to hormones in the UK in 2010 [^115d9H63]. British Journal of Cancer (2011). Low credibility.

Breast cancer

Thebrought together and reanalysed the worldwide epidemiological evidence on the relation between breast cancer risk and use of hormonal contraceptives. Table 1 shows the excess relative risks (ERRs) (= relative risk (RR)−1) associated with current and past use of combined (oestrogen plus progesterone) OC preparations. Duration of use, age at first use, and the dose and type of hormone within the contraceptives had little additional effect on breast cancer risk, once recency of use had been taken into account. Hormonal contraceptives containing only progestogens comprised < 3% of the study population, but results were broadly similar to those found for combined OCs (an increase in risk for use in the previous 5 years: ERR 0.17; but no evidence of an increase in risk 10 or more years after stopping use); risks are assumed to be the same as for combined contraceptive preparations (Table 1).

Cancer of the cervix uteri

combined the results from studies published between 1966 and 2002 to examine the relationship between the risk of cancers of the cervix and duration and recency of use of hormonal contraceptives, taking into account potential confounding factors, such as HPV status, sexual partners, screening history, smoking and use of barrier contraceptives. More recently, theobtained the original data from 24 studies to conduct a pooled analysis. They found that risk of cervical cancer increased by a factor of 1.07 for each year of use of hormonal contraception (or 1.38 (1.30–1.46) for 5 years use). In ex-users, the excess risk is approximately halved 2–4 years after cessation, and halved again after 5–9 years. There was no significant excess risk 10 years after cessation of use.

Duration of use of contraception, among current users, by age group, is not available from any UK source. In the multicentre study of the, the mean duration of use, in control women, was 6 years. Clearly, the controls for cases of cervix cancer are older women, with a mean age of about 40. Younger women would have had shorter durations of use: we assume 2 years at ages 15–19 and 4 years at ages 20–24, so that the ERRs of current users are as shown in Table 2. For ex-users, we assume a halving of risk after 2–4 years, and halving again at 5–9, as in the.

When they are taken correctly without missing any pills, the chance of becoming pregnant is approximately 1% per year (1 pregnancy per 100 women per year of use). Typical failure rates, including women who do not always take the pill correctly, are approximately 5% per year (5 pregnancies per 100 women per year of use). The chance of becoming pregnant increases with each missed pill during a menstrual cycle.

In comparison, typical failure rates for other non-surgical methods of birth control during the first year of use are as follows:

ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN®may also be taken to treat moderate acne if all of the following are true:

You have started having menstrual cycles
You are at least 15 years old
Your healthcare professional says it is safe for you to use the pill
You want to use the pill for birth control

WHO SHOULD NOT TAKE ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES

Cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious cardiovascular side effects from oral contraceptive use. This risk increases with age and with heavy smoking (15 or more cigarettes per day) and is quite marked in women over 35 years of age. Women who use oral contraceptives are strongly advised not to smoke.

### Estrogens, migraine, and stroke [^117C3vcA]. Stroke (2004). Low credibility.

Epidemiological studies suggest the existence of close but complex relationships between estrogens, migraine, and stroke in women before menopause. Migraine, particularly without aura, is strongly influenced by estrogens as illustrated by the frequency of onset at puberty, of menstrual migraine, and of improvement during pregnancy. Migraine, particularly with aura, is a risk factor for ischemic stroke with a relative risk of 3, further increased by tobacco smoking and oral contraceptive use. The pathophysiological mechanism underlying these close relationships remains unknown. In practice, given the very low absolute risk of stroke in young women, there is no systematic contraindication to oral contraceptive use in young female migraineurs but rather a firm recommendation for no smoking and for the use of low-estrogen-content pills or progestogens only, particularly in migraine with aura.

### Norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol (Pirmella 1 / 35) [^116aj5So]. FDA (2013). Low credibility.

In the above table, the risk of death from any birth control method is less than the risk of childbirth, except for oral contraceptive users over the age of 35 who smoke and pill users over the age of 40 even if they do not smoke. It can be seen in the table that for women aged 15 to 39, the risk of death was highest with pregnancy (7–26 deaths per 100,000 women, depending on age). Among pill users who do not smoke, the risk of death was always lower than that associated with pregnancy for any age group, although over the age of 40, the risk increases to 32 deaths per 100,000 women, compared to 28 associated with pregnancy at that age. However, for pill users who smoke and are over the age of 35, the estimated number of deaths exceeds those for other methods of birth control. If a woman is over the age of 40 and smokes, her estimated risk of death is four times higher (117/100,000 women) than the estimated risk associated with pregnancy (28/100,000 women) in that age group.

The suggestion that women over 40 who do not smoke should not take oral contraceptives is based on information from older, higherdose pills. An Advisory Committee of the FDA discussed this issue in 1989 and recommended that the benefits of low-dose oral contraceptive use by healthy, non-smoking women over 40 years of age may outweigh the possible risks.

### Mortality among contraceptive pill users: cohort evidence from royal college of general practitioners' oral contraception study [^113K6ZLK]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Methods

The RCGP Oral Contraception Study started in May 1968 when 1400 general practitioners throughout the United Kingdom recruited approximately 23 000 women who were using oral contraceptives and a similar number of women who had never used this method of birth control. All the women were married or living as married, most were white, and their mean age at recruitment was 29 (SD 6.6) years. Information collected at baseline included parity, smoking habits, social class (based on husband's occupation), and relevant medical history. The general practitioners subsequently supplied, at six monthly intervals, information about any hormonal preparations prescribed, any pregnancies and their outcome, all new episodes of illness, any surgery, and any deaths occurring in women still under their observation. Women remained under general practice follow-up until they left the area of the recruiting doctor (approximately 56% of total cohort), the doctor left the study (13%), they obtained their contraceptives from a source other than the general practitioner (3%), they died (2%), or the study stopped general practice follow-up at the end of 1996 (26%).

### Choosing the right oral contraceptive pill for teens [^112Dh2HA]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) continue to be the most commonly used form of prescription contraceptives used by adolescents in the United States. With proper use, oral contraceptives provide safe and effective birth control. Broad categories of OCPs include progestin-only pills (POPs) and combined oral contraceptive pills (COCs). Certain types of progestins have more potent antiandrogenic properties and are more effective in treating acne, hirsutism, and polycystic ovary syndrome. This article reviews types of OCPs, discusses risks and benefits of OCPs, and provides guidance for how to choose the most beneficial and appropriate OCP for individual adolescent patients.

### An update on the antiestrogenic effect of smoking: a literature review with implications for researchers and practitioners [^112QJePV]. Menopause (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To draw attention to the implications of smoking in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis and for the effectiveness and safety of hormone therapy. DESIGN Summary of own research and a MEDLINE search of English-language literature on the antiestrogenic effect of smoking in pre- and postmenopausal women published during the past two decades.

Results

Numerous observations suggest that part of the detrimental effect of smoking on bone metabolism is mediated by an adverse influence on sex-steroid metabolism, and in particular by an estrogen-lowering effect. Furthermore, in smokers, serum concentrations of estradiol and estrone during oral, but not parenteral, hormone therapy (HT) reach only half the concentrations of nonsmokers. Thus, cigarette smoking may reduce the favorable effects of HT significantly and may even negate the protective effects. In such cases, the failure of preventive therapy is a failure of dosing rather than of HT per se.

Conclusions

We urge colleagues to take the antiestrogenic effect of smoking into account when drawing conclusions from population-based trials, as well as when prescribing HT to their patients for the prevention of menopause-related health problems.

L. CURRENT CONSIDERATIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS

L.1 Current Considerations

The 2019 guidelines are designed to take into account factors that influence Clinical Action Thresholds. Working groups considered risk factors to determine their importance for inclusion in clinical applications of the guidelines, taking into account both the magnitude of effect on the estimated risk, as well as the feasibility of collecting accurate data in clinical practice to inform management. Screening history profoundly influenced risk estimates, specifically current HPV and cytology test results, previous HPV test results, and history of histologic HSIL. Patient screening history is often not known; therefore, unknown history is considered separately as a risk factor. Additional factors were considered because of their association with cervical cancer in the literature: HPV vaccination, age, hormonal contraception use, history of sexually transmitted infection, parity, cigarette smoking, obesity, and sexual behaviors including age of first intercourse and multiple partners. HPV vaccination in adolescence (generally before the age of 18 years) does seem to reduce the risk of HPV 16/18 infections and associated histologic HSIL. However, HPV vaccination status was omitted from this revision of the guidelines because (a) management guidelines are already very conservative in the population younger than 25 years, (b) the population prevalence of on-time HPV vaccination in the 25- to 29-year-old population is currently lower than that needed for herd immunity, thus changing recommendations for this population as a whole is not yet warranted, and (c) making person-specific recommendations based on age at vaccine series initiation and number of doses received is impractical in the United States in the absence of linkable, comprehensive, state-based immunization registries. Overall, none of the other factors contributed clinically meaningful risk beyond that afforded by the screening factors noted previously. Therefore, additional factors were not included in risk estimates. Analyses were limited for heavy smoking history and younger than 30 years.

DETAILED PATIENT LABELING

This product (like all oral contraceptives) is intended to prevent pregnancy. It does not protect against HIV infection (AIDS) and other sexually transmitted diseases. PLEASE NOTE: This labeling is revised from time to time as important new medical information becomes available. Therefore, please review this labeling carefully.

The following oral contraceptive product contains a combination of a progestogen and estrogen, the two kinds of female hormones:

Cyred EQ (Desogestrel and Ethinyl Estradiol Tablets USP)

Each white to off-white tablet contains 0.15 mg desogestrel and 0.03 mg ethinyl estradiol. Each green tablet contains inert ingredients.

INTRODUCTION

Any woman who considers using oral contraceptives (the birth control pill or the pill) should understand the benefits and risks of using this form of birth control. This patient labeling will give you much of the information you will need to make this decision and will also help you determine if you are at risk of developing any of the serious side effects of the pill. It will tell you how to use the pill properly so that it will be as effective as possible. However, this labeling is not a replacement for a careful discussion between you and your healthcare professional. You should discuss the information provided in this labeling with him or her, both when you first start taking the pill and during your revisits. You should also follow your healthcare professional's advice with regard to regular check-ups while you are on the pill.

EFFECTIVENESS OF ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES

Oral contraceptives or "birth control pills" or "the pill" are used to prevent pregnancy and are more effective than most other non-surgical methods of birth control. When they are taken correctly without missing any pills, the chance of becoming pregnant is approximately 1% (1 pregnancy per 100 women per year of use). Typical failure rates, including women who do not always take the pills exactly as directed, are approximately 5% per year. The chance of becoming pregnant increases with each missed pill during a menstrual cycle.

In comparison, typical failure rates for other non-surgical methods of birth control during the first year of use are as follows:

WHO SHOULD NOT TAKE ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES

Do not use Cyred EQ if you smoke cigarettes and are over 35 years old. Smoking increases your risk of serious cardiovascular side effects (heart and blood vessel problems) from combination oral contraceptives, including death from heart attack, blood clots or stroke. This risk increases with age and the number of cigarettes you smoke.

Appendix 2

Summary of treatment options in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)

Oligomenorrhoea/amenorrhoea

- Lifestyle change (5% to 10% weight loss and structured exercise).

- Oral contraceptive pill (OCP; low oestrogen doses, for example 20 μg may be preferable).

- Cyclic progestins (for example, 10 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate for 14 days every 2 to 3 months).

- Metformin (improves ovulation and menstrual cyclicity).

Hirsutism treatment recommendations

- Cosmetic therapy.

- Laser treatment.

- Eflornithine cream can be added and may induce a more rapid response.

Pharmacological therapy

- Medical therapy if patient concerned about hirsutism and cosmetic therapy ineffective, inaccessible or unaffordable.

- Primary therapy is the OCP (monitor glucose tolerance in those at risk of diabetes).

- Antiandrogen monotherapy should not be used without adequate contraception.

- Trial therapies for ≥ 6 months before changing dose or medication.

- **Combination therapy**: if ≥ 6 months of OCP is ineffective, add antiandrogen to OCP (daily spironolactone 50 mg twice a day or cyproterone acetate 25 mg/day for days 1 to 10 of the active OCP tablets).

Infertility

- Obesity independently exacerbates infertility and reduces effectiveness of interventions. Maternal and foetal pregnancy risks are greater and long-term metabolic outcomes in the child are related to maternal weight at conception. Consistent with international guidelines, women who are overweight prior to conception should be advised on folate, smoking cessation, weight loss and optimal exercise, prior to additional interventions.

- Given age-related infertility, advise women to optimise family planning.

- Infertility therapies may include clomiphene, gonadotrophins and in vitro fertilisation.

Metabolic syndrome, prediabetes, diabetes and cardiovascular disease risk

Obesity independently causes metabolic complications; lifestyle/exercise is critical:

- Lifestyle change with a 5% weight loss reduces diabetes risk by approximately 50% to 60% in high-risk groups.

- Metformin* reduces the risk of diabetes by approximately 50% in high-risk groups.

*Metformin and the OCP are not currently approved for use to manage PCOS by many regulatory bodies. The OCP is primarily indicated for contraception and metformin for diabetes. However, their use is recommended by international and national specialist societies and is evidence based.

### Migraine and risk of stroke [^117VyzqG]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

MIGRAINE, STROKE AND SPECIAL CONCERNS IN WOMEN

Migraine is a predominantly female disorder, affecting women with a ratio of approximately 3:1 to men. The highest 1-year prevalence of migraine is between ages of 25 and 55 years, and it is estimated that 22%–37% of women will experience migraine during their reproductive years. As the association between migraine and ischaemic stroke is particularly strong in women with MA under the age of 45, certain aspects during a woman's life need to be considered.

Migraine and oral contraceptives

Migraine is particularly prevalent in the fertile period when women opt for oral contraception. While the risks of venous thromboembolism in users of oral contraceptives are well established, the risks of cardiovascular arterial diseases are more uncertain. The safety of oral contraceptives in women with migraine remains controversial. Numerous studies report increased risk of ischaemic stroke in women with migraine who use oral contraceptive. Stronger associations are found for MA and in those with additional vascular risk factors. Particularly smoking combined with the use of oral contraceptives in young women with MA increase risk of ischaemic stroke. The risk of stroke in women taking oral contraceptives seems to correlate with the dose of oestrogen contained in the formulation. Caution should be warranted when interpreting the data on the risk of stroke in women with migraine using oral contraceptives; as migraine is often not diagnosed according to ICHD criteria, many studies do not distinguish between MA and MO, and the dose classification of oral contraceptives is often heterogeneous. Studies evaluating the effect of oral contraceptive use on the risk of haemorrhagic stroke is conflicting, and no firm conclusions can be made.

Clinical implication

For most women, modern oral contraceptives are safe and highly effective methods of contraception. Despite the overall low risk of stroke from oral contraceptives, certain subgroups of women, particularly those who have MA, are older than 35 years, smoke cigarettes or have other stroke risk factors, may be at higher risk. One should look for an underlying genetic or acquired coagulopathy in those with previous thromboembolism or risk factors for an underlying coagulopathy (eg, family history of thromboembolism, spontaneous abortion, history of malignancy). Type of oral contraceptive should also be taken into consideration, as the oestrogen content differs between products. New onset of migraine aura, new onset MO in temporal relationship to starting oral contraceptive, development of unusual aura symptoms or prolonged aura may necessitate further evaluation or cessation of oral contraceptives.

### Levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol (Lessina) [^112qwtA1]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

In the above table, the risk of death from any birth-control method is less than the risk of childbirth, except for oral contraceptive users over the age of 35 who smoke and pill users over the age of 40 even if they do not smoke. It can be seen in the table that for women aged 15 to 39, the risk of death was highest with pregnancy (7–26 deaths per 100,000 women, depending on age). Among pill users who do not smoke, the risk of death was always lower than that associated with pregnancy for any age group, except for those women over the age of 40, when the risk increases to 32 deaths per 100,000 women, compared to 28 associated with pregnancy at that age. However, for pill users who smoke and are over the age of 35, the estimated number of deaths exceeds those for other methods of birth control. If a woman is over the age of 40 and smokes, her estimated risk of death is four times higher (117/100,000 women) than the estimated risk associated with pregnancy (28/100,000 women) in that age group.

The suggestion that women over 40 who do not smoke should not take oral contraceptives is based on information from older high-dose pills and on less-selective use of pills than is practiced today. An Advisory Committee of the FDA discussed this issue in 1989 and recommended that the benefits of oral contraceptive use by healthy, non-smoking women over 40 years of age may outweigh the possible risks. However, all women, especially older women, are cautioned to use the lowest-dose pill that is effective.

Contraception in women at high cardiovascular disease risk

Combined oral contraceptive pills (OCP) carry an increased risk for venous thrombosis, MI, and stroke, which is significantly enhanced by cigarette smoking. OCPs containing high-dose ethinyl oestradiol have been associated with increased BP. This is due to increased production of angiotensinogen/angiotensin II and related to OCP formulation/dose. In the Danish Cohort Study, use of combined OCPs containing 20 μg of ethinyl oestradiol increased the relative risk of both thrombotic stroke and MI by 1.60 (95% CI 1.37–1.86) and 1.40 (95% CI 1.07–1.81), respectively, in comparison to non-OCP users. Thus, OCP's containing ethinyl oestradiol should be avoided in women with a history of VTE, stroke, CVD, or any other PVD. The ACOG has developed guidelines for use of OCP in women at elevated cardiovascular risk. In healthy women below 35 years with pre-existing hypertension, OCP can be used. If BP remains stable after a few months, OCP may be continued. Use of OCP is contraindicated in women older than 35 years who smoke, have severe dyslipidaemia, or obesity. Progestin-only contraceptives (POCs) are not associated with increased vascular risk (arterial or venous), although evidence suggests that MPA use may be associated with a slightly increased risk. In women at CVD risk, POC administered by oral, sub-cutaneous, or intra-uterine routes can be prescribed.

### Clinical briefs… [^114Eamdk]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Use of Oral Contraception Among Adolescents The Committee on Adolescent Health Care of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has developed an educational bulletin on the benefits and safety of oral contraceptive use in adolescents. The bulletin replaces ACOG Committee Opinion No. 90, February 1991. The bulletin appears in the December 1999 issue of. Obstetrics and Gynecology. The bulletin states that OCs are the most popular method of contraception among female adolescents. Low-income adolescents who cohabit have the highest rate of OC failure. Adolescents are more likely to miss taking pills than adults are and may not take OCs consistently depending on their patterns of sexual activity. According to the committee, the rate of OC failure among adolescents is as high as 32 percent, compared with 5 percent among all typical users.

Adolescents must be given special attention during every office visit for contraceptive services. Physicians should educate patients on human sexuality and the prevention of sexually transmitted disease. Physicians should also emphasize confidentiality so that adolescents feel free to discuss contraception concerns. The committee states that adolescents should be made aware of the beneficial effects of OCs on a number of conditions that can affect their lives. Such conditions include dysmenorrhea, benign breast disease, functional ovarian cysts, iron deficiency anemia, acne and menstrual irregularity. OCs can also reduce the risk of ovarian and endometrial cancers, pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy and toxic shock syndrome. Although endometrial and ovarian cancers are rare in adolescents, if OCs are taken for more than one year, the protective effects last for at least 19 years after the discontinuation of use.

Adolescents may not take OCs once they are prescribed because of fear of complications or side effects. Most of these fears are unfounded, says the committee, and should be addressed with proper counseling. Fear of weight gain, menstrual irregularities, and other side effects such as nausea, breast tenderness and headaches are common reasons adolescents stop taking OCs. Patients should be informed that weight gain is infrequent with low-dose OCs. Breakthrough bleeding is not harmful and tends to resolve in a few cycles. Other side effects are rare and often resolve spontaneously. If irregular bleeding is a problem, adolescents should be screened for pregnancy and sexually transmitted disease, and be counseled about consistent OC use.

DETAILED PATIENT LABELING

This product (like all oral contraceptives) is intended to prevent pregnancy. It does not protect against HIV infection (AIDS) and other sexually transmitted diseases.

INTRODUCTION

Any woman who considers using oral contraceptives (the "birth control pill" or the "pill") should understand the benefits and risks of using this form of birth control.

Although the oral contraceptives have important advantages over other methods of contraception, they have certain risks that no other method has and some of these risks may continue after you have stopped using the oral contraceptive. This brochure will give you much of the information you will need to make this decision and will also help you determine if you are at risk of developing any of the serious side effects of the pill. It will tell you how to use the pill properly so that it will be as effective as possible. However, this brochure is not a replacement for a careful discussion between you and your healthcare professional.

You should discuss the information provided in this brochure with him or her, both when you first start taking the pill and during your revisits. You should also follow your healthcare professional's advice with regard to regular check-ups while you are on the pill.

EFFECTIVENESS OF ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES

Oral contraceptives or "birth control pills" or "the pill" are used to prevent pregnancy and are more effective than other nonsurgical methods of birth control. The chance of becoming pregnant is less than 1% (1 pregnancy per 100 women per year of use) when the pills are used correctly and no pills are missed. Typical failure rates are actually 3% per year. The chance of becoming pregnant increases with each missed pill during a menstrual cycle.

In comparison, typical accidental pregnancy rates for other nonsurgical methods of birth control during the first year of use are as follows:

IUD: 3%

Diaphragm with spermicides: 18%

Spermicides alone: 21%

Vaginal Sponge: 18% to 28%

Condom alone: 12%

Periodic abstinence: 20%

Injectable progestogen: 0.3% to 0.4%

Implants: 0.03% to 0.04%

No methods: 85%

WHO SHOULD NOT TAKE ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES

Cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious cardiovascular side effects from oral contraceptive use. This risk increases with age and with heavy smoking (15 or more cigarettes per day) and is quite marked in women over 35 years of age. Women who use oral contraceptives should not smoke.

### The risk of oral contraceptives in the etiology of inflammatory bowel disease: a meta-analysis [^117F8XGM]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

Several environmental and genetic factors have been implicated to date in the development of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). The aim of this study was to provide a quantification of the risk of oral contraceptive pill (OCP) use in the etiology of inflammatory bowel disease.

Methods

A literature search was performed to identify comparative studies reporting on the association of oral contraceptive use in the etiology of UC and CD between 1983 and 2007. A random-effect meta-analysis was used to compare the incidence of UC or CD between the patients exposed to the OCP and nonexposed patients. The results were adjusted for smoking.

Results

A total of 75,815 patients were reported on by 14 studies, with 36,797 exposed to OCP and 39,018 nonexposed women. The pooled relative risk (RR) for CD for women currently taking the OCP was 1.51 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.17–1.96, P = 0.002), and 1.46 (95% CI 1.26–1.70, P < 0.001), adjusted for smoking. The RR for UC in women currently taking the OCP was 1.53 (95% CI 1.21–1.94, P = 0.001), and 1.28 (95% CI 1.06–1.54, P = 0.011), adjusted for smoking. The RR for CD increased with the length of exposure to OCP. Moreover, although the RR did not reduce once the OCP was stopped, it was no longer significant once the OCP was stopped (CI contains 1), both for CD and for UC.

Conclusions

This study provides evidence of an association between the use of oral contraceptive agents and development of IBD, in particular CD. The study also suggests that the risk for patients who stop using the OCP reverts to that of the nonexposed population.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: uterine neoplasms, version 3.2025 [^114gX8AR]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Uterine neoplasms — hormone therapy considerations are outlined as follows: The risk from estrogen-alone replacement therapy (without progesterone) may not be as high in younger patients (< 60 years) who have had hysterectomy. The NCCN Panel agrees that estrogen therapy is a reasonable option for patients who are at low risk for tumor recurrence, but initiating such therapy should be individualized and discussed in detail with the patient. If adjuvant treatment is carried out, there should be a 6- to 12-month waiting period before initiation of hormone therapy, and participation in clinical trials is strongly encouraged. Selective estrogen-receptor modulators (SERMs) may prove to be attractive options for hormone therapy, and non-hormonal therapy may be considered in patients who are deemed poor candidates for hormone therapy (eg, people who smoke, those with a history of breast cancer, those with a history of multiple strokes).

### Norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol (Nylia 7 / 7 / 7) [^116uo4ps]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Minimizing exposure to estrogen and progestogen is in keeping with good principles of therapeutics. For any particular estrogen/progestogen combination, the dosage regimen prescribed should be one which contains the least amount of estrogen and progestogen that is compatible with a low failure rate and the needs of the individual patient. New acceptors of oral contraceptive agents should be started on preparations containing the lowest estrogen content which is judged appropriate for the individual patient.

e. Persistence of risk of vascular disease

There are two studies which have shown persistence of risk of vascular disease for ever-users of oral contraceptives. In a study in the United States, the risk of developing myocardial infarction after discontinuing oral contraceptives persists for at least 9 years for women 40 to 49 years who had used oral contraceptives for five or more years, but this increased risk was not demonstrated in other age groups.8In another study in Great Britain, the risk of developing cerebrovascular disease persisted for at least 6 years after discontinuation of oral contraceptives, although excess risk was very small.34However, both studies were performed with oral contraceptive formulations containing 50 micrograms or higher of estrogens.

2.000000000000000e+00 Estimates of Mortality from Contraceptive Use

One study gathered data from a variety of sources which have estimated the mortality rate associated with different methods of contraception at different ages (Table 2). These estimates include the combined risk of death associated with contraceptive methods plus the risk attributable to pregnancy in the event of method failure. Each method of contraception has its specific benefits and risks. The study concluded that with the exception of oral contraceptive users 35 and older who smoke, and 40 and older who do not smoke, mortality associated with all methods of birth control is low and below that associated with childbirth. The observation of an increase in risk of mortality with age for oral contraceptive users is based on data gathered in the 1970's.35Current clinical recommendation involves the use of lower estrogen dose formulations and a careful consideration of risk factors. In 1989, the Fertility and Maternal Health Drugs Advisory Committee was asked to review the use of oral contraceptives in women 40 years of age and over. The Committee concluded that although cardiovascular disease risks may be increased with oral contraceptive use after age 40 in healthy non-smoking women (even with the newer low-dose formulations), there are also greater potential health risks associated with pregnancy in older women and with the alternative surgical and medical procedures which may be necessary if such women do not have access to effective and acceptable means of contraception. The Committee recommended that the benefits of low-dose oral contraceptive use by healthy non-smoking women over 40 may outweigh the possible risks.

EFFECTIVENESS OF ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES

Oral contraceptives or "birth control pills" or "the pill" are
used to prevent pregnancy and are more effective than other non-surgical methods
of birth control. When they are taken correctly, the chance of becoming pregnant
is less than 1% (1 pregnancy per 100 women per year of use) when used perfectly,
without missing any pills. Typical failure rates are actually 3% per year. The
chance of becoming pregnant increases with each missed pill during a menstrual
cycle.

In comparison, typical failure rates for other nonsurgical methods of birth
control during the first year of use are as follows:

Implant: < 1%

Injection: < 1%

IUD: 1 to 2%

Diaphragm with spermicides: 18%

Spermicides alone: 21%

Vaginal
sponge: 18 to 36%

Cervical Cap: 18 to 36%

Condom alone (male):
12%

Condom alone (female): 21%

Periodic abstinence: 20%

No
methods: 85%

WHO SHOULD NOT TAKE ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES

Cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious
cardiovascular side effects from oral contraceptive use. This risk increases
with age and with heavy smoking (15 or more cigarettes per day) and is quite
marked in women over 35 years of age. Women who use oral contraceptives are
strongly advised not to smoke.

### Should oral contraceptive pills be available without a prescription? A systematic review of over-the-counter and pharmacy access availability [^116twBqX]. BMJ Global Health (2019). High credibility.

Methods

Effectiveness review: PICO question and inclusion criteria

We sought to answer the following question: should contraceptive pill/oral contraceptives be made available over the counter without a prescription?

Our effectiveness review followed the PICO question format:

Population

Individuals using contraceptive pill/oral contraceptives.

Intervention

Availability of contraceptive pill/oral contraceptives OTC (without a prescription) or behind the counter (pharmacy access, including dispensing from trained pharmacy personnel and pharmacist prescribing of hormonal birth control).

Comparison

Availability of contraceptive pill/oral contraceptives by prescription only.

Outcomes

Uptake of OCs (initial use).
Continuation of OCs (or, conversely, discontinuation).
Adherence to OCs (correct use).
Comprehension of instructions (product label).
Health impacts (unintended pregnancy, side effects, adverse events or use of OCs despite contraindications).
Social harms (eg, coercion, violence (including intimate partner violence, violence from family members or community members, and so on), psychosocial harm, self-harm, and so on), and whether these harms were corrected/had redress available.
Client satisfaction.

To be included in the effectiveness review, a study had to meet the following criteria:

Employ a study design comparing OTC availability of OCs (with or without pharmacist dispensation) to prescription-only availability of OCs.
Measured one or more of the outcomes listed above.
Published in a peer-reviewed journal.

We focused on daily contraceptive pill/oral contraceptives for routine pregnancy prevention and did not include studies examining pills specifically for emergency contraception.

Where data were available, we stratified all analyses by the following subcategories:

Behind-the-counter (pharmacy access) versus OTC availability without a prescription.
COCs versus POPs.
Point of access (eg, stores, pharmacies, and so on).
Prior use of contraception.
Age: adolescent girls and young women (aged 10–14, 15–19 and 15–24) and adult women (aged 25+).
Vulnerabilities (ie, poverty, disability, religion).
High-income versus low/middle-income countries.
Literacy/educational level.

Study inclusion was not restricted by location of the intervention or language of the article. We planned to translate articles in languages other than English if identified. The complete protocol was registered and is available in PROSPERO (CRD42019119406).

### Improving combined contraceptive pill / oral contraceptives prescribing in general practice [^113UuLou]. BMJ Open Quality (2017). Medium credibility.

Baseline measurement

Between 11 October 2015 and 11 January 2016, up to 56 women aged 14–39 years were prescribed the COCP by a general practitioner.

Forty-one per cent of consultations comprised substandard risk assessment and documentation of medical eligibility. Documentation of medical eligibility was notably worse when prescribing for non-contraceptive purposes (eg, menorrhagia). The percentage of consultations that lacked the UKMEC eligibility documentation is detailed as follows, specific to each measured condition: BP, 16%; smoking status, 25%; BMI, 16%.

In our initial audit, three patients were documented to have a UKMEC condition 3 but received no specialist input: systolic BP 143, undiagnosed breast lump, first-degree family member with VTE.

Eighty-seven per cent of patients were not given relevant advice on compliance and missed pill rules, and 92% of patients had no formal STI risk assessment.

Sex susceptibility and hormonal therapy — Evidence from prospective cohort studies fails to support the notion of a sex differential in susceptibility to lung cancer from smoking, and equal rates of lung cancer mortality in younger US men and women at a time of equal smoking prevalence argue against an important gender difference; for a specific degree of smoking history, the relative risk estimates for men and women are very similar. A meta-analysis of two large-scale randomized controlled trials of hormonal therapy with an estrogen plus progestin formulation found a significantly increased risk of lung cancer (relative risk, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.03–1.8), and reports suggest the risk may be specific to estrogen plus progestin formulations, with null results for estrogen-only formulations in the Women's Health Initiative and in a prospective cohort study that observed increased risk for estrogen plus progestin formulations with null results for estrogen-only formulations.

See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.

● Nymyo is contraindicated in women over 35 years old who smoke. (4)

● Cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious cardiovascular events from combination oral contraceptives (COC) use. (4)

Cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious cardiovascular events from combination oral contraceptive (COC) use. This risk increases with age, particularly in women over 35 years of age, and with the number of cigarettes smoked. For this reason, COCs are contraindicated in women who are over 35 years of age and smoke [see Contraindications (4)].

### Levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol and ethinyl estradiol (simpesse) [^113p6YnK]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Simpesse is contraindicated in women over 35 years of age who smoke [see Contraindications (4)]. Cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious cardiovascular events from COC use. This risk increases with age, particularly in women over 35 years of age, and with the number of cigarettes smoked.

Venous Events

Use of COCs increases the risk of venous thromboembolic events (VTEs), such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Risk factors for VTEs include smoking, obesity, and family history of VTE, in addition to other factors that contraindicate use of CHCs [see Contraindications (4)]. While the increased risk of VTE associated with use of COCs is well-established, the rates of VTE are even greater during pregnancy, and especially during the postpartum period (see Figure 1). The rate of VTE in females using COCs has been estimated to be 3 to 9 cases per 10,000 woman years.

The risk of VTE is highest during the first year of use of a COC and when restarting hormonal contraception after a break of four weeks or longer. The risk of thromboembolic disease due to COCs gradually disappears after COC use is discontinued.

Figure 1 shows the risk of developing a VTE for women who are not pregnant and do not use oral contraceptives, for women who use oral contraceptives, and for women in the postpartum period. To put the risk of developing a VTE into perspective: If 10,000 women who are not pregnant and do not use oral contraceptives are followed for one year, between 1 and 5 of these women will develop a VTE.

Use of Simpesse provides women with more hormonal exposure on a yearly basis than conventional monthly oral contraceptives containing the same strength synthetic estrogens and progestins (an additional 9 and 13 weeks of exposure to progestin and estrogen, respectively, per year).

### State of the art review: emerging therapies: the use of insulin sensitizers in the treatment of adolescents with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) [^111DCyFx]. International Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology (2011). Medium credibility.

Oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in adolescents and adults are described as among primary treatment options for those not seeking pregnancy, improving regular menstrual cyclicity and acne and hirsutism while lowering endometrial hyperplasia risk, and typically contain both an estrogen component (often ethinyl estradiol) and a progestin. Additional considerations include contraception, as 1/3 of teenage girls with PCOS report being sexually active; OCP use reduces the risk of ovarian and uterine cancer in the general population, though evidence was insufficient for preventing endometrial cancer in women with PCOS. However, OCPs fail to treat insulin resistance and may exacerbate carbohydrate intolerance, lipid abnormalities, and cardiovascular disease; in adolescents with PCOS, a 12-month course of newer OCPs containing either desogestrel or cyproterone as progestin was associated with decreased insulin sensitivity and increased total, LDL and HDL cholesterol with variable triglyceride changes. In women without PCOS, current low dose OCP use has been linked to more than a doubling of myocardial infarction risk with risk estimates 2.12 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.56, 2.86) and 2.48 (95% CI: 1.91–3.22), although the absolute risk remains minimal in adolescents, even among tobacco users; longitudinal studies in women with PCOS on OCPs are lacking and the potential exists for excessive use to exacerbate metabolic derangements and adverse cardiovascular outcomes.

### Norethindrone [^112yJfD3]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Cigarette smoking greatly increases the possibility of suffering heart attacks and strokes. Women who use oral contraceptives are strongly advised not to smoke.

Norethindrone tablets do not contain estrogen and, therefore, this insert does not discuss the serious health risks that have been associated with the estrogen component of combined oral contraceptives. The health care provider is referred to the prescribing information of combined oral contraceptives for a discussion of those risks, including, but not limited to, an increased risk of serious cardiovascular disease in women who smoke, carcinoma of the breast and reproductive organs, hepatic neoplasia, and changes in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. The relationship between progestin-only oral contraceptives and these risks have not been established and there are no studies definitely linking progestin-only pill (POP) use to an increased risk of heart attack or stroke.

The physician should remain alert to the earliest manifestation of symptoms of any serious disease and discontinue oral contraceptive therapy when appropriate.

1. Ectopic pregnancy

The incidence of ectopic pregnancies for progestin-only oral contraceptive users is 5 per 1000 woman-years. Up to 10% of pregnancies reported in clinical studies of progestin-only oral contraceptive users are extrauterine. Although symptoms of ectopic pregnancy should be watched for, a history of ectopic pregnancy need not be considered a contraindication to use of this contraceptive method. Health providers should be alert to the possibility of an ectopic pregnancy in women who become pregnant or complain of lower abdominal pain while on progestin-only oral contraceptives.

Use of OCs despite contraindications

The two studies from the 2000s reported on the use of OCs despite contraindications.

The Border Contraceptive Access Study reported use of OCs despite contraindications using the WHO Medical Eligibility Criteria (MEC) (third edition) relative (category 3) and absolute (category 4) contraindications. At the baseline survey, at least one category 3 or 4 contraindication was reported by 21.4% of OTC users and 13.8% of clinic users (p = 0.002). OTC users were more likely to have any category 3 contraindication (13.4% vs 8.6%, p = 0.006), but there was no difference in category 4 contraindications (7.4% vs 5.3%, p = 0.162). The study also provided a list of specific contraindications. For most contraindications there was no significant difference for OTC and clinic users; however, OTC users were significantly more likely than clinic users to have category 3 hypertension (140–159/90–99) (8.4% vs 4.5%, p = 0.036) or to both smoke (< 15 cigarettes per day) and be 35 years or older (6.4% vs 3.1%, p = 0.017).

The 2000 Mexican National Health Survey analysis reported use of OCs despite category 3 contraindications using the WHO MEC Criteria from 1996 based on hypertension and smoking at or over age 35. Overall, the study found no significant differences in contraindications between OC users who obtained their pills OTC versus those who obtained them at a clinic (table 3). This finding held true when comparing OTC to clinic users on contraindications related to hypertension (≥ 160/100) (1.7% vs 1.8%), smoking and age 35 or older (9.4% vs 7.5%), and both contraindications combined (4.5% vs 3.6%).

In the above table, the risk of death from any birth control method is less than the risk of childbirth, except for oral contraceptive users over the age of 35 who smoke and pill users over the age of 40 even if they do not smoke. It can be seen in the table that for women aged 15 to 39, the risk of death was highest with pregnancy (7–26 deaths per 100,000 women, depending on age). Among pill users who do not smoke, the risk of death was always lower than that associated with pregnancy for any age group, although over the age of 40, the risk increases to 32 deaths per 100,000 women, compared to 28 associated with pregnancy at that age. However, for pill users who smoke and are over the age of 35, the estimated number of deaths exceeds those for other methods of birth control. If a woman is over the age of 40 and smokes, her estimated risk of death is four times higher (117/100,000 women) than the estimated risk associated with pregnancy (28/100,000 women) in that age group.

The suggestion that women over 40 who don't smoke should not take oral contraceptives is based on information from older higher dose pills and on less selective use of pills than is practiced today. An Advisory Committee of the FDA discussed this issue in 1989 and recommended that the benefits of oral contraceptive use by healthy, non-smoking women over 40 years of age may outweigh the possible risks. However, all women, especially older women, are cautioned to use the lowest dose pill that is effective.

Weight (BMI) measurement is not needed to determine medical eligibility because all methods can be used or generally can be used among patients with obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2), although measuring weight and calculating BMI at baseline might be helpful for discussing concerns about any changes in weight and whether changes might be related to use of the contraceptive method.

### Mortality among contraceptive pill users: cohort evidence from royal college of general practitioners' oral contraception study [^1123awU7]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

Continued follow-up of this large UK cohort did not reveal a substantially increased overall rate of death among oral contraceptive users, compared with never users. If anything, the analysis of the full dataset suggested an overall reduction in mortality, resulting from lower rates of different specific causes of death, including cancer and circulatory disease. A higher rate of violent or accidental death among oral contraceptive users than among never users has been noted in the cohort before and seems to be persisting.

Strengths and limitations of study

A major strength of the study was the ability to include more than a million woman years of observation, accumulated over a 39 year period and involving nearly three times as many deaths (a total of more than 4600) as before. A previous study has shown good agreement between the cause of death reported by the general practitioners and that on the death certificate. Although both sources of information are prone to error in the attribution of underlying cause of death, we have no reason to suspect systematic differences because of a woman's use (or not) of oral contraception. This is especially so for more recent events, for which most of the doctors certifying the deaths will have been unaware of the contraceptive history of the deceased woman.

We were able to adjust for the potentially important confounding factors of age, smoking, social class, parity, and (for some analyses of the general practice observation subset) use of hormone replacement therapy. The adjustments tended to make little difference to the rates. Smoking data have not been routinely updated during the study. Use of smoking information collected at study entry will tend to underestimate the effects of smoking. This is because women in the cohort are more likely to have stopped smoking than started since recruitment, so disproportionately more women will be misclassified in the smoker group with a decreased risk of smoking related death than in the non-smoker group at increased risk of such an event. Furthermore, a study of a subgroup of approximately 10 000 women who completed a health survey in the mid-1990s produced virtually identical estimates of risk for myocardial infarction associated with oral contraceptive use based on updated smoking data to those based on information collected at recruitment. As we were unable to adjust our results for other lifestyle or familial variables, residual confounding must remain an alternative explanation for our findings.

### Lifetime cancer risk and combined oral contraceptives: the Royal college of general practitioners' oral contraception study [^113nVBfC]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Oral contraceptives have been used by hundreds of millions of women around the world. Important questions remain regarding the very long-term cancer risks that are associated with oral contraception. Despite previous research, important questions remain about the safety of these contraceptives: (1) How long do endometrial, ovarian, and colorectal cancer benefits persist? (2) Does combined oral contraceptive use during the reproductive years produce new cancer risks later in life? (3) What is the overall balance of cancer among past users as they enter the later stages of their lives?

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to examine the very long-term cancer risks or benefits associated with the use of combined oral contraceptives, including the estimated overall life-time balance.

Study Design

The 46,022 women who were recruited to the UK Royal College of General Practitioners' Oral Contraception Study in 1968 and 1969 were observed for up to 44 years. Directly standardized rates of specific and any cancer were calculated for "ever" and "never" users of combined oral contraceptives; data were standardized for age, parity, social class, and smoking. Attributable risk and preventive fraction percentages were calculated. Poisson regression that adjusted for the same variables was used to estimate incidence rate ratios between ever and never users and to examine effects by time since last oral contraceptive use.

Results

There were 4661 ever users with at least 1 cancer during 884,895 woman-years of observation and 2341 never users with at least 1 cancer during 388,505 woman-years of observation. Ever use of oral contraceptives was associated with reduced colorectal (incidence rate ratio, 0.81; 99% confidence interval, 0.66–0.99), endometrial (incidence rate ratio, 0.66; 99% confidence interval, 0.48–0.89), ovarian (incidence rate ratio, 0.67; 99% confidence interval, 0.50–0.89), and lymphatic and hematopoietic cancer (incidence rate ratio, 0.74; 99% confidence interval, 0.58–0.94). An increased risk of lung cancer was seen only among ever users who smoked at recruitment. An increased risk of breast and cervical cancer that was seen in current and recent users appeared to be lost within approximately 5 years of stopping oral contraception, with no evidence of either cancer recurring at increased risk in ever users with time. There was no evidence of new cancer risks appearing later in life among women who had used oral contraceptives. Thus, the overall balance of cancer risk among past users of oral contraceptives was neutral with the increased risks counterbalanced by the endometrial, ovarian, and colorectal cancer benefits that persist at least 30 years.

Conclusion

Most women who choose to use oral contraceptives do not expose themselves to long-term cancer harms; instead, with some cancers, many women benefit from important reductions of risk that persist for many years after stopping.

WHO SHOULD NOT TAKE ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES:

Cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious cardiovascular side effects from oral contraceptive use. This risk increases with age and with heavy smoking (15 or more cigarettes per day) and is quite marked in women over 35 years of age. Women who use oral contraceptives should not smoke.

Some women should not use the pill. For example, you should not take the pill if you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant. You should also not use the pill if you have or have ever had any of the following conditions:

A history of heart attack or stroke
Blood clots in the legs (thrombophlebitis), lungs (pulmonary embolism), or eyes
A history of blood clots in the deep veins of your legs
Chest pain (angina pectoris)
Known or suspected breast cancer or cancer of the lining of the uterus
Unexplained vaginal bleeding (until a diagnosis is reached by your doctor)
Yellowing of the whites of the eyes or of the skin (jaundice) during pregnancy or during previous use of the pill
Liver tumor (benign or cancerous)
Take any Hepatitis C drug combination containing ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir. This may increase levels of the liver enzyme "alanine aminotransferase" (ALT) in the blood.

Tell your health care professional if you have ever had any of these conditions. Your health care professional can recommend a safer method of birth control.

OTHER CONSIDERATIONS BEFORE TAKING ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES:

Tell your health care professional if you have:

Breast nodules, fibrocystic disease of the breast or an abnormal breast x-ray or mammogram
Diabetes
Elevated cholesterol or triglycerides
High blood pressure
Migraine or other headaches or epilepsy
Mental depression
Gallbladder, heart or kidney disease
History of scanty or irregular menstrual periods

Women with any of these conditions should be checked often by their health care professional if they choose to use oral contraceptives.

Also, be sure to inform your doctor or health care professional if you smoke or are on any medications.

### Levonorgestrel / ethinyl estradiol and ethinyl estradiol (rivelsa) [^117WaXHU]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

RIVELSA is contraindicated in women over 35 years of age who smoke [see Contraindications (4)]. Cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious cardiovascular events from COC use. This risk increases with age, particularly in women over 35 years of age, and with the number of cigarettes smoked.

Venous Events

Use of COCs increases the risk of venous thromboembolic events (VTEs), such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Risk factors for VTEs include smoking, obesity, and family history of VTE, in addition to other factors that contraindicate use of COCs [see Contraindications (4)]. While the increased risk of VTE associated with use of COCs is well-established, the rates of VTE are even greater during pregnancy, and especially during the postpartum period (see Figure 1). The rate of VTE in females using COCs has been estimated to be 3 to 9 cases per 10,000 woman years.

The risk of VTE is highest during the first year of use of a COC and when restarting hormonal contraception after a break of four weeks or longer. The risk of thromboembolic disease due to COCs gradually disappears after COC use is discontinued.

Figure 1 shows the risk of developing a VTE for females who are not pregnant and do not use oral contraceptives, for females who use oral contraceptives, and for females in the postpartum period. To put the risk of developing a VTE into perspective: If 10,000 females who are not pregnant and do not use oral contraceptives are followed for one year, between 1 and 5 of these females will develop a VTE.

Use of RIVELSA provides women with more hormonal exposure on a yearly basis than conventional monthly oral contraceptives containing the same strength synthetic estrogens and progestins (an additional 9 and 13 weeks of exposure to progestin and estrogen, respectively, per year). In the clinical trial, three cases of deep vein thrombosis were reported.

### U.S. medical eligibility criteria for contraceptive use, 2024 [^113EPmWG]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). High credibility.

Combined hormonal contraceptives (CHCs) — smoking: For a. Age < 35 years the classification is 2; for b. Age ≥ 35 years, < 15 cigarettes per day is 3 and ≥ 15 cigarettes per day is 4. Evidence states COC users who smoked were at increased risk for cardiovascular diseases, especially myocardial infarction, compared with those who did not smoke, and studies demonstrated an increased risk for myocardial infarction with increasing number of cigarettes smoked per day.

WARNING: CIGARETTE SMOKING AND SERIOUS CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS

Cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious cardiovascular events from combination oral contraceptives (COC) use. This risk increases with age, particularly in women over 35 years of age, and with the number of cigarettes smoked. For this reason, COCs, including Lo Simpesse, are contraindicated in women who are over 35 years of age and smoke [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

BRIEF SUMMARY PATIENT PACKAGE INSERT

Oral contraceptives, also known as "birth control pills" or "the pill", are taken to prevent pregnancy and when taken correctly without missing any pills, have a failure rate of approximately 1% per year. The typical failure rate is approximately 5% per year when women who miss pills are included. For most women oral contraceptives are also free of serious or unpleasant side effects. However, forgetting to take pills considerably increases the chances of pregnancy.

For the majority of women, oral contraceptives can be taken safely. But there are some women who are at high risk of developing certain serious diseases that can be fatal or may cause temporary or permanent disability. The risks associated with taking oral contraceptives increase significantly if you:

smoke
have high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol
have or have had clotting disorders, heart attack, stroke, angina pectoris, cancer of the breast or sex organs, jaundice or malignant or benign liver tumors.

Although cardiovascular disease risks may be increased with oral contraceptive use after age 40 in healthy, non-smoking women (even with the newer low-dose formulations), there are also greater potential health risks associated with pregnancy in older women.

You should not take the pill if you suspect you are pregnant or have unexplained vaginal bleeding.

Do not use Nortrel 7/7/7 if you smoke cigarettes and are over 35 years old. Smoking increases your risk of serious cardiovascular side effects (heart and blood vessel problems) from combination oral contraceptives, including death from heart attack, blood clots or stroke. This risk increases with age and the number of cigarettes you smoke.

### Desogestrel and ethinyl estradiol and ethinyl estradiol (Simliya) [^112WLyhL]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious cardiovascular side effects from oral contraceptive use. This risk increases with age and with heavy smoking (15 or more cigarettes per day) and is quite marked in women over 35 years of age. Women who use oral contraceptives are strongly advised not to smoke.

Some women should not use the pill. For example, you should not take the pill if you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant. You should also not use the pill if you have any of the following conditions:

A history of heart attack or stroke
Blood clots in the legs (thrombophlebitis), lungs (pulmonary embolism), or eyes
A history of blood clots in the deep veins of your legs
Chest pain (angina pectoris)
Known or suspected breast cancer
Unexplained vaginal bleeding (until a diagnosis is reached by your doctor)

### Oral contraceptives. risks [^1174f22k]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2000). Low credibility.

The modern combination oral contraceptive (OC) has become a mainstay in the effort to provide safe, reliable, and effective contraception. Safety concerns with OC use have largely been laid to rest as a result of multiple and extensive studies. Even so, misperceptions about the risks of OC use and a relative lack of recognition concerning the numerous and important noncontraceptive benefits limit their use, thus putting women in needless danger for unintended pregnancy. Indeed, even fears concerning breast cancer risk and OC use have been unsubstantiated by an abundance of data. Clinicians should be aware of the safety of low-dose OCs so that they can provide accurate and individualized counseling concerning the applicability of OCs and other contraceptive methods.
