## Question

does elevated CAC mean patient has CAD?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking if an elevated coronary artery calcium (CAC) score means the patient has coronary artery disease (CAD), and what that implies for obstructive disease, prognosis, and management decisions. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about definitions and pathobiology to be precise about what CAC measures. Then, I should verify the diagnostic performance of CAC for detecting any CAD versus obstructive CAD. Next, I will consider what an "elevated" CAC truly signifies prognostically. After that, I need to examine exceptions, especially when CAC is zero but risk remains. Finally, I will align interpretation with contemporary guideline use and outline practical next steps for care.

> Let me first confirm the foundational definitions so I don't overstate what CAC can and cannot tell us. CAC is a noninvasive CT-derived quantification of calcified coronary plaque, which is a highly specific manifestation of atherosclerosis and thus a direct measure of coronary atherosclerotic burden, although it does not visualize non-calcified plaque and can therefore underestimate total plaque in earlier disease phases where lesions are soft and non-calcified.

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic performance before jumping to conclusions about stenosis. At low thresholds (Agatston ≥ 1), CAC has very high sensitivity and negative predictive value for obstructive CAD, but specificity and positive predictive value are limited; in a head-to-head comparison, CAC ≥ 1 had sensitivity 97% and NPV 100% against invasive angiography, whereas CAC ≥ 100 had sensitivity 73% and specificity 90%, and CAC ≥ 1000 was highly specific but insensitive, underscoring that a positive CAC does not necessarily equal flow-limiting stenosis [^1178i5fo]. In a symptomatic cohort, CAC showed 98% sensitivity and 99% NPV for ≥ 50% stenosis by CCTA, again highlighting excellent rule-out performance but only modest specificity, so a zero CAC strongly argues against obstructive disease but an elevated CAC is not proof of obstruction [^112DFL6U].

> Hold on, let me consider what an elevated CAC actually signifies beyond stenosis. Any CAC > 0 indicates the presence of calcified atherosclerotic plaque, i.e., coronary atherosclerosis by definition, and higher scores track with greater overall plaque burden and stepwise higher risk of cardiovascular events, with very high CAC levels approaching the risk seen in stable secondary prevention populations over time [^112TZXrB] [^116rF4pb]. I should confirm that this is primarily prognostic: CAC quantifies disease burden and future risk rather than diagnosing ischemia or an anatomically critical lesion on its own, which is important for counseling and treatment planning [^112TZXrB].

> I need to check how well CAC separates non-obstructive from obstructive disease. Studies comparing CAC with coronary CT angiography demonstrate that elevated CAC frequently reflects non-obstructive plaque, and CAC alone underestimates the prevalence of non-calcified disease; in one high-risk asymptomatic sample, CT angiography showed that most CAD was non-obstructive despite elevated CAC, while only a minority had ≥ 50% stenoses, reinforcing that CAC is a plaque burden marker rather than a stenosis test [^1178i5fo] [^113zdevv]. Let me reconsider: this means a high CAC should prompt aggressive risk modification and, if symptoms or clinical context warrant, an anatomic or functional test to clarify stenosis and ischemia rather than assuming obstruction from CAC alone [^112TZXrB].

> But wait, what if the CAC score is zero; does that exclude disease entirely? I should double-check this nuance. CAC = 0 is associated with very low short-to-intermediate term risk and a very low likelihood of obstructive CAD, yet it does not absolutely exclude non-calcified obstructive lesions in selected high-risk phenotypes or clinical scenarios; prevalence of significant stenosis can be higher when overall clinical risk is very high despite CAC = 0, and rare obstructive disease can still occur in acute chest pain settings or in younger patients with soft plaque [^112DFL6U] [^113myRL3] [^112xozLb]. Hmm, wait a minute, earlier I almost equated CAC = 0 with "no CAD", but I should correct that: it is a powerful negative risk marker, not an absolute rule-out in high-risk or acute presentations where further testing may still be indicated based on pretest probability and symptoms [^112TZXrB].

> Next, I should review how guidelines use CAC to guide prevention and decision-making, to ensure my interpretation is clinically aligned. Contemporary guidelines recommend CAC to refine risk around treatment thresholds in primary prevention and to leverage CAC detected on prior chest CTs to improve risk stratification; CAC ≥ 100 or high-percentile scores generally support statin initiation, whereas CAC = 0 can support deferring statins in otherwise borderline or intermediate-risk patients after shared decision-making, recognizing exceptions such as diabetes, severe hypercholesterolemia, or strong family history [^114U1Ct6] [^11148i8b] [^113xX2Fc]. Let me verify the prognostic framing: modern evidence emphasizes total atherosclerotic burden over stenosis severity for event prediction and supports the use of CAC to target preventive pharmacotherapy intensity, with CAC = 0 conveying durable low risk and very high CAC indicating risk comparable to secondary prevention cohorts [^112TZXrB].

> I will now examine the practical synthesis to answer the clinical question clearly. Does an elevated CAC mean the patient has CAD? Yes, in the atherosclerotic sense: any CAC > 0 confirms calcified coronary plaque and therefore established coronary atherosclerosis, which carries graded increases in long-term cardiovascular risk as the score rises; no, not necessarily in the obstructive sense: an elevated CAC does not by itself diagnose a flow-limiting stenosis or ischemia, so additional anatomic or functional testing is guided by symptoms, pretest probability, and overall risk, not CAC alone [^112TZXrB] [^116rF4pb] [^1178i5fo]. Hold on, I should verify the next steps: for asymptomatic patients, prioritize aggressive risk factor modification proportional to CAC burden; for symptomatic patients or those with very high CAC or discordant risk, consider CCTA or stress imaging rather than invasive angiography reflexively; in emergency or high-risk contexts, a zero CAC substantially lowers the likelihood of obstructive CAD but does not fully exclude it, so clinical judgment and troponin/ECG-driven pathways prevail [^112xozLb] [^112DFL6U] [^114U1Ct6].

> Let me think about communicating risk and personalizing prevention. Using CAC-informed "coronary age" can help patients grasp their vascular risk and engage in therapy, and integrating CAC with emerging tools like polygenic risk scores further personalizes prediction and may better identify individuals who benefit from earlier or more intensive prevention than risk factors alone would suggest [^113bJM6w] [^115Q49iN] [^1171nUaK]. I should confirm that while CAC strongly augments traditional risk models, it complements rather than replaces careful assessment of clinical risk enhancers, family history, and patient values in shared decision-making [^112TZXrB].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about therapy triggered solely by CAC without context. While higher CAC generally supports intensifying lipid-lowering and lifestyle therapy, aspirin decisions in primary prevention remain nuanced, with signals that CAC ≥ 100 may identify subgroups with more favorable net benefit, whereas CAC = 0 argues against aspirin because bleeding risks likely outweigh benefits; these decisions still require individualized assessment of bleeding risk and patient preference [^112TZXrB] [^113LHp9Q]. I should double-check that my bottom line remains consistent: elevated CAC confirms coronary atherosclerosis and higher future risk, but it is not a stand-alone test for obstructive CAD, so pair CAC with symptoms and overall risk to decide on further testing and prevention intensity [^112TZXrB] [^116rF4pb] [^1178i5fo].

Yes, elevated coronary artery calcium (CAC) indicates coronary atherosclerosis and therefore **confirms CAD** [^112TZXrB]. However, CAC does not specify stenosis severity or ischemia; thus, **further testing** (such as CCTA or functional imaging) is needed to assess obstructive disease and guide management [^1178i5fo] [^116rF4pb].

---

## Pathophysiological basis of CAC and CAD

CAC reflects calcified atherosclerotic plaque — a hallmark of CAD — and is **almost exclusively** found in atherosclerotic arteries [^112bW6Qt] [^11735D7i]. Calcification occurs as plaques mature; therefore, CAC is a **direct marker** of coronary atherosclerosis [^1136soUb] [^113zdevv].

---

## Clinical significance of elevated CAC scores

Elevated CAC correlates with higher total plaque burden and increased risk of CAD events, showing a **graded risk** relationship by score [^1136soUb] [^112TZXrB]. Typical risk categories:

- **CAC 1–99**: Mild atherosclerosis; modestly increased risk [^113xX2Fc].
- **CAC 100–399**: Moderate atherosclerosis; significantly increased risk [^1136soUb].
- **CAC ≥ 400**: Severe atherosclerosis; high risk of obstructive CAD and events [^116rF4pb].

---

## Diagnostic accuracy of CAC for CAD

CAC is a **highly specific** marker of coronary atherosclerosis, though it does not quantify stenosis severity or ischemia [^1136soUb] [^1178i5fo]. Key points:

- **Specificity**: High for atherosclerosis; calcification is rarely present without CAD [^1136soUb].
- **Sensitivity**: Limited for obstructive CAD; noncalcified plaques can cause significant stenosis [^1178i5fo].
- **Negative predictive value**: High; CAC = 0 strongly suggests low short-term risk, but does not exclude noncalcified plaque [^112DFL6U] [^113mYQFz].

---

## Limitations of CAC scoring

CAC scoring has important limitations: it can **miss noncalcified plaques**, which may be obstructive or rupture-prone [^1178i5fo], and it **does not quantify luminal narrowing or ischemia** [^1178i5fo]. Calcification can also occur without significant stenosis, particularly in older adults [^1115UWtN].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines endorse CAC to refine risk and guide prevention but emphasize that **additional testing** is needed to define obstructive disease and ischemia [^112TZXrB] [^11148i8b]. The **ACC/AHA 2018** guidelines advise using CAC to refine risk and guide statin decisions in intermediate-risk adults [^113xX2Fc] [^116ZAoai], and the **ESC 2024** guidelines recommend using CAC to improve risk classification and inform treatment decisions [^114U1Ct6].

---

## Clinical management implications

Elevated CAC warrants **aggressive risk reduction** (lifestyle, statins, blood pressure control) and further testing to define obstructive disease and ischemia [^116rF4pb]:

- **CAC 1–99**: Lifestyle and consider statins based on risk [^113xX2Fc].
- **CAC 100–399**: Initiate statins; consider further testing if symptomatic [^112TZXrB].
- **CAC ≥ 400**: High-intensity statins; consider CCTA or functional testing to assess obstruction and ischemia [^113Nt4jC].

---

## Conclusion

Elevated CAC confirms coronary atherosclerosis and therefore **indicates CAD**, but it does not define stenosis severity or ischemia [^112TZXrB]. Additional testing (CCTA or functional imaging) is required to assess obstructive disease and guide management [^1178i5fo].

### Coronary calcium score and computed tomography coronary angiography in high-risk asymptomatic subjects: Assessment of diagnostic accuracy and prevalence of non-obstructive coronary artery disease [^1178i5fo]. European Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

The aim of the study was to compare the coronary artery calcium score (CACS) and computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA) for assessing non-obstructive/obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) in high-risk asymptomatic subjects.

Two hundred and thirteen consecutive asymptomatic subjects (113 male; mean age 53.6 ± 12.4 years) with more than one risk factor and an inconclusive or unfeasible non-invasive stress test result underwent CACS and CTCA in an outpatient setting. All patients also underwent conventional coronary angiography (CAG). Data from CACS (threshold for a positive image: Agatston score 1/100/1,000) and CTCA were compared with CAG regarding the degree of CAD (non-obstructive/obstructive; ≥ 50% lumen reduction).

The mean calcium score was 151 ± 403, and the prevalence of obstructive CAD was 17% (8% one-vessel and 10% two-vessel disease).

Per-patient sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values:

- **CACS (Agatston ≥ 1)**: 97%, 75%, 45%, and 100%
- **CACS (Agatston ≥ 100)**: 73%, 90%, 60%, and 94%
- **CACS (Agatston ≥ 1,000)**: 30%, 98%, 79%, and 87%
- **CTCA**: 100%, 98%, 97%, and 100% (p < 0.05)

Prevalence of CAD detected by the methods:

- **CTCA**: 65% prevalence of all CAD (48% non-obstructive)
- **CACS**: 37% prevalence of all CAD (21% non-obstructive) (p < 0.05)

CACS proved inadequate for the detection of obstructive and non-obstructive CAD compared with CTCA. CTCA has a high diagnostic accuracy for the detection of non-obstructive and obstructive CAD.

### Incremental prognostic value of coronary artery calcium score versus CT angiography among symptomatic patients without known coronary artery disease [^112DFL6U]. Atherosclerosis (2014). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value and test characteristics of the coronary artery calcium (CAC) score for identifying obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) in comparison with coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) among symptomatic patients.

- **Methods**: A retrospective cohort study was conducted at two large hospitals, including all symptomatic patients without prior CAD who underwent both CCTA and CAC. The accuracy of CAC for identifying ≥ 50% and ≥ 70% stenosis by CCTA was evaluated. The prognostic value of CAC and CCTA was compared for the prediction of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE, defined as non-fatal myocardial infarction, cardiovascular death, late coronary revascularization (> 90 days), and unstable angina requiring hospitalization).

- **Results**: Among 1,145 included patients, the mean age was 55 ± 12 years, with a median follow-up of 2.4 (IQR: 1.5–3.5) years. Overall, 406 (35%) CCTA were normal, 454 (40%) had < 50% stenosis, and 285 (25%) had ≥ 50% stenosis. The prevalence of ≥ 70% stenosis was 16%. Among 483 (42%) patients with a CAC score of zero, 395 (82%) had normal CCTA, 81 (17%) had < 50% stenosis, and 7 (1.5%) had ≥ 50% stenosis. Two (0.4%) patients had ≥ 70% stenosis. For the diagnosis of ≥ 50% stenosis, CAC had a sensitivity of 98% and specificity of 55%. The negative predictive value (NPV) for CAC was 99% for ≥ 50% stenosis and 99.6% for ≥ 70% stenosis by CCTA. There were no adverse events among the 7 patients with zero calcium and ≥ 50% CAD. For the prediction of MACE, the c-statistic for clinical risk factors of 0.62 increased to 0.73 (p < 0.001) with CAC versus 0.77 (p =

Assessment of ASCVD risk using CAC

CAC measurements improve and refine risk assessment in patients without clinical ASCVD (the primary prevention population). In fact, CAC has been shown to be a better predictor of incident ASCVD than lipid levels or traditional risk estimators. Initially, coronary plaque is predominantly noncalcified and at higher risk for rupture and ultimately becomes more calcified with time. CAC scans only recognize and account for calcified plaque. Despite this, CAC does correlate directly with total atherosclerotic plaque burden.

A recent paper furthered the connection between CAC scores and the degree of calcified and noncalcified coronary atherosclerosis. Hollenberg and colleagues found that among symptomatic patients with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD) in the Progression of Atherosclerotic Plaque Determined by Computed Tomographic Angiography Imaging (PARADIGM) registry, the degree of obstructive CAD (≥ 50% stenosis) as measured on coronary CT angiography (cCTA) correlated directly with CAC scores. On mean 3.8-year follow-up imaging, the proportion of plaque burden that was calcified increased in patients with baseline CAC > 100. Moreover, in subjects with CAC scores of ≥ 400, there was disproportional growth in the calcified plaque with a volumetric increase 16 times that of noncalcified plaque.

Ultimately, coronary plaque burden does confer an increased risk for adverse cardiac outcomes. A CAC score of 0 has a strong negative predictive value for clinical cardiovascular events and death in primary prevention populations over the next few years.

### Coronary artery calcification score as tool for risk assessment among families with premature coronary artery disease [^1127NC7Q]. Atherosclerosis (2016). Low credibility.

There is discussion about incorporating a family history (FamHis) of premature coronary artery disease (CAD) in risk score algorithms; however, FamHis provides information on individual risk. Coronary artery calcification score (CACS) is a metric of atherosclerosis that may determine the individual risk within families at high risk of premature CAD.

- **Methods**: In asymptomatic individuals (n = 704), we assessed the association between FamHis of CAD and elevated CACS. To assess the predictive value of CACS in individuals with a FamHis of CAD, we performed a post-hoc analysis on the St. Francis Heart Study (n = 834). We assessed, in a case-control design, the risk of future CAD in individuals with a FamHis of CAD and either CACS > 80th percentile or no CACS at all.

- **Results**: Individuals with a FamHis for CAD had an increased risk for elevated CACS (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 2.23 (95% CI 1.48–3.36); p < 0.05). In individuals with CACS > 80th percentile, a FamHis of CAD doubled the CAD event rate (positive FamHis 12.5% vs. negative FamHis 6.8%; adjusted HR 2.08 (95% CI 1.09–3.87); p < 0.05).

- **Conclusion**: CAC scoring leads to risk discrimination among those with a positive FamHis for premature CAD. These results support testing CAC score in asymptomatic individuals with a positive FamHis to identify a high-risk population.

### Personalization of primary prevention: Exploring the role of coronary artery calcium and polygenic risk score in cardiovascular diseases [^1171nUaK]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Personalized healthcare is becoming increasingly popular given the vast heterogeneity in disease manifestation between individuals. Many commonly encountered diseases within cardiology are multifactorial in nature. Disease progression and response are often variable due to environmental and genetic factors influencing disease states. This variability makes accurate early identification and primary prevention difficult in certain populations, especially young patients with limited atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk factors.

Newer strategies, such as coronary artery calcium (CAC) scans and polygenic risk scores (PRS), are being implemented to aid in the detection of subclinical disease and heritable risk, respectively. Data surrounding CAC scans have shown promising results in their ability to detect subclinical atherosclerosis and predict the risk of future coronary events, especially at the extremes; however, predictive variability exists among different patient populations, limiting the test's specificity. Furthermore, relying only on CAC scores and ASCVD risk scores may fail to identify a large group of patients needing primary prevention who lack subclinical disease and traditional risk factors, but harbor genetic variabilities strongly associated with certain cardiovascular diseases.

PRS can overcome these limitations. These scores can be measured in individuals as early as birth to identify genetic variants placing them at elevated risk for developing cardiovascular disease, irrespective of their cardiovascular health status. By applying PRS alongside CAC scans, clinicians may improve the accuracy of risk assessments and tailor prevention strategies more effectively.

### Performance of the coronary calcium score in an outpatient chest pain clinic and strategies for risk stratification [^114aUXPH]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Low credibility.

Conversely, patients with risk scores of 30% and above for CCS, Model 1, and Model 2, or CAC > 400 have a very high likelihood of coronary artery disease (see Table 4). At the cut-off of > 0.30, the specificities of Model 1 and Model 2 were approximately 90%; at cut-off CAC > 400, the specificity in detecting coronary artery disease was 95.3%. Hence, physicians may consider initiating aspirin and statins at the same clinic visit while arranging for invasive coronary angiograms or functional imaging tests, with early follow-up to ensure the stability of symptoms. For patients in risk regions of > 10%, a functional stress test such as a treadmill exercise echocardiogram should be performed to assess ischemia in the presence of atherosclerosis for prognostication.

The cost of a CT coronary angiogram at our institution is $1,304, while that of CAC is $500. Thirty-five percent of our study population had risk scores > 10%, requiring further testing, and a stress echocardiogram costs $772. As such, this strategy can save up to $800 in low-risk patients; even if the patient undergoes the functional stress test after the CAC, the cost will be similar to a CTCA. Additionally, studies have shown that CTCA may lead to increased invasive coronary angiography, and additional functional testing may have to be performed for prognostication and to defer invasive coronary angiography.

### Interpreting the coronary artery calcium score - Critical information for the practicing physician [^116rF4pb]. The American Journal of Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Coronary artery calcium scanning is a routine test for assessing the severity of atherosclerosis in asymptomatic individuals. This inexpensive, noninvasive test quantifies the calcium deposition in the four principal coronary arteries. Correct interpretation is important to the physician, for recommending therapy, and to the patient, for determining their lifetime risk of a cardiovascular event. A score of 0 indicates that a cardiovascular event is extremely unlikely in the next five years. In contrast, a score greater than 0 portends a coronary event. The higher the score, the greater the risk. Both the arterial location of the calcium and the number of coronary arteries involved alter the interpretation of the calcium score. At any given age, females have significantly lower scores than males. One-third of individuals with scores greater than 1000 will have a cardiovascular event within three years. For all elevated calcium scores, aggressive treatment is warranted, including significant lifestyle changes and medications to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Understanding the importance of the coronary artery calcium score will result in improved therapy and patient compliance.

### Coronary calcium score and cardiovascular risk [^1136soUb]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) is a highly specific feature of coronary atherosclerosis. Based on single-center and multicenter clinical and population-based studies with short-term and long-term outcomes data (up to 15-year follow-up), CAC scoring has emerged as a widely available, consistent, and reproducible means of assessing risk for major cardiovascular outcomes. It is especially useful in asymptomatic people for planning primary prevention interventions such as statins and aspirin. CAC testing in asymptomatic populations is cost effective across a broad range of baseline risk.

This review summarizes evidence concerning CAC, including its pathobiology, modalities for detection, predictive role, use in prediction scoring algorithms, CAC progression, evidence that CAC changes the clinical approach to the patient and patient behavior, novel applications of CAC, future directions in scoring CAC scans, and new CAC guidelines.

### Coronary artery calcium: from risk prediction to treatment allocation and clinical trials [^112TZXrB]. Heart (2023). High credibility.

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) is a direct measure of an individual's coronary atherosclerotic burden. Higher levels of CAC are strongly associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events, and individuals with very high CAC levels have a CVD risk similar to stable persons with a prior CVD event. Conversely, the absence of CAC (CAC = 0) is associated with a low long-term risk of CVD, even among groups classified as high risk based on traditional risk factors. Accordingly, the guideline-based role of CAC in the allocation of CVD prevention therapies has expanded to include both statin and non-statin medications.

Beyond prevention therapies, it is now widely recognized that the total burden of atherosclerosis is a stronger risk factor for CVD than a sole focus on coronary stenosis. Furthermore, evidence is accruing to support expanding the value of CAC = 0 among low-risk symptomatic patients given its very high negative predictive value for ruling out obstructive coronary artery disease. There is now an appreciation of the value of routine assessment of CAC on all non-gated chest CTs, and with the advent of artificial intelligence, automated interpretation is now possible. Additionally, CAC is now firmly established in randomized trials as a tool to identify high-risk patients most likely to benefit from pharmacotherapies.

Future studies incorporating measures of atherosclerosis beyond the Agatston score will lead to continued refinement of CAC scoring, further improvements in the personalization of CVD risk prediction, and more individualized allocation of prevention therapies.

### Coronary artery calcium testing-too early, too late, too often [^116ZAoai]. JAMA Cardiology (2025). Low credibility.

The traditional risk factors, enhancing factors, and risk scores help clinicians assess atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk for primary prevention. The latest cholesterol guidelines suggest measuring coronary artery calcium (CAC) score by computed tomography (CT) in those at intermediate risk when there is uncertainty about statin initiation for primary prevention. CAC testing can improve both risk estimation and adherence to cardiovascular risk-reducing behaviors.

As measuring the CAC score has become more widely available, this article focuses on three situations where CAC testing may be omitted or deferred until a time when CAC testing can provide clinically useful information. Three clinical scenarios to facilitate the clinician-patient risk discussion are as follows: (1) when CAC testing is too early, (2) when CAC testing is too late, and (3) when CAC testing is repeated too often. The timing of CAC testing sits within the decision point of lipid-lowering therapy use. High-risk young adults may face an elevated lifetime risk of cardiovascular disease despite a CAC level of 0, whereas older adults may not see an expected benefit over a short time horizon or may already be taking lipid-lowering therapy, rendering a CAC score less valuable. Integrating a CAC score into the decision to initiate lipid-lowering therapy requires an understanding of a patient's risk factors, including age, as well as the natural history of atherosclerosis and related events.

These clinical scenarios reflect when consideration of the CAC score is crucial.

### Coronary artery calcium screening: Current status and recommendations from the European Society of Cardiac Radiology and North American Society for Cardiovascular Imaging [^1112153R]. European Radiology (2008). Low credibility.

Guidelines and literature on screening for coronary artery calcium for cardiac risk assessment are reviewed for both general and special populations. It is shown that, for both general and special populations, a zero score excludes most clinically relevant coronary artery disease. The importance of standardization of coronary artery calcium measurements by multidetector CT is discussed.

### Does coronary calcium scoring with a SCORE better predict significant coronary artery stenosis than without? Correlation with computed tomography coronary angiography [^113myRL3]. European Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

To determine the effectiveness of the coronary artery calcium score (CACS) alone and combined with Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation (SCORE) in adult patients for significant coronary artery stenosis by using computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA) as the reference standard, two thousand twenty-one patients with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD) underwent CACS testing and CTCA. Patients were examined with dual-source CT and were grouped according to their age, gender, CACS, and estimated SCORE risk. The existence of coronary plaque and the degree of stenosis were assessed with CTCA. Sensitivity, specificity, and ROC curves were analyzed.

CACS was the single independent variable in estimating the relative risk of critical stenosis and had a superior outcome when compared with SCORE risk in logistic regression and ROC curve analyses. The area under the ROC curve was greatest in the age interval between 50–59 years. When SCORE was combined with CACS in patients with a zero CACS, the percentage of significant stenosis increased from 1.4% to 7.0% in patients with high or very high SCORE risk and decreased to 0.9% in patients with low or moderate SCORE risk.

In conclusion, the combination of CACS with SCORE risk predicts coronary artery stenosis. When CACS is zero, CTCA can be performed in patients with high or very high SCORE risk.

Measurement and Definition of Risk Factors

All participants had risk factor and laboratory data collected as part of their routine clinic visit and/or at the time of the CAC scans.

Hypertension was defined based on a prior diagnosis of hypertension or treatment with antihypertensive therapy. Blood pressure taken at the time of CAC scans was not used to override a clinical diagnosis of hypertension. Diabetes mellitus was defined as a prior diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, or treatment with antidiabetic medications. Dyslipidemia was defined as a prior diagnosis of dyslipidemia (elevated triglycerides and/or low high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol), treatment with any lipid‐lowering drugs, or low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol > 160 mg/dL, high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol 150 mg/dL. Smoking status was defined based on Cigarette smoking status (Yes/No). A family history of CHD was mostly determined by the presence of a first‐degree relative with a history of CHD. A more stringent definition of premature family history (< 55 years in a male or < 65 years in a female relative) was applied in the Columbus, OH site. In the case of individuals with partially missing risk factor data, multiple imputation was conducted. A validation of the imputation approach has been previously reported. 18

The 10‐year risk of ASCVD was calculated according to the Pooled Cohort Equations. 1

### Coronary calcium scoring for long-term mortality prediction in patients with and without a family history of coronary disease [^114VN89D]. Heart (2016). High credibility.

Minimal data are available regarding the long-term mortality risk of subclinical atherosclerosis using coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring among patients with a family history (FH) of coronary artery disease (CAD). The aim of the present analysis was to assess the prognostic utility of CAC scoring among cohorts of young and older patients with and without a FH of CAD.

A total of 9,715 consecutive asymptomatic patients, free of known CAD, underwent CAC scoring for cardiovascular risk assessment. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality, with a median follow-up of 14.6 years. Unadjusted and risk-factor adjusted Cox proportional hazard modeling was employed. We calculated the area under the curve (AUC) from receiver operating characteristics analysis.

Fifteen-year all-cause mortality rates ranged from 4.7% to 25.0% for FH patients and from 5.0% to 38.0% for non-FH patients with CAC scores of 0 to > 400. In patients aged ≥ 60 years with FH of CAD, there was a significant improvement in the AUC with CAC over CAD risk factors (AUC: 0.539 vs 0.725, p < 0.001). No such improvement was observed in FH patients aged < 60 years (AUC: 0.636 vs 0.626, p = 0.67).

CAC effectively stratified mortality risk of patients with and without FH of CAD. However, for younger and lower-risk FH cohorts, CAC screening did not provide additive prognostic information beyond that of the traditional cardiac risk factors.

### Derivation of a coronary age calculator using traditional risk factors and coronary artery calcium: The multi-ethnic study of atherosclerosis [^113bJM6w]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). High credibility.

The global burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is high and continues to rise, resulting in CVD being the leading cause of death globally. Accurate risk prediction remains the cornerstone of decision-making in the primary prevention of CVD, although ease of communication and understanding of predicted risk are equally important. Despite this, the optimal method for communicating risk to individual patients is not clear. The traditional method of expressing CVD risk as a probability of an event over the subsequent 10 years has important shortcomings. For example, poor understanding of this metric by patients may lead to inaccurate perceptions of susceptibility to CVD, which can impair patient motivation and ultimately inhibit the effectiveness of preventive care.

The concept of "risk age" has been proposed to facilitate risk communication to patients. Using this approach, which contrasts a patient's chronological age with their vascular age, patients are given a biological age equivalent to their estimated risk. For example, a 55-year-old man with several cardiovascular risk factors could be told that his coronary arteries are "as old as those of a 70-year-old healthy man". It has been proposed that this approach to risk communication may increase patient understanding of risk estimations and, therefore, adherence to recommended lifestyle changes and pharmacotherapies.

Previous methods of estimating risk age have had some shortcomings that limit their utility in clinical practice.

### Coronary artery calcium as a synergistic tool for the age- and sex-specific risk of cardiovascular and cancer mortality: The Coronary Artery Calcium Consortium [^115uTeaK]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

For individuals with elevated coronary artery calcium (CAC) scores, our study demonstrates that younger men with even mildly elevated CAC scores are more likely to experience death from cardiovascular disease (CVD) than cancer. In contrast, for younger women aged 40 to 65 years, elevated CAC scores are less strongly associated with CVD mortality and more strongly associated with cancer mortality. For older individuals over the age of 65, our results show that while even men with relatively high CAC scores are less likely to die from CVD, women with only moderate CAC scores are more likely to suffer a fatal CVD event. Consequently, maximal CVD prevention treatment strategies are highly likely to extend life and reduce CVD mortality among people with elevated CAC scores. Conversely, among individuals with CAC = 0, CVD preventive therapies are unlikely to reduce CVD mortality, allowing for less strict CVD risk factor treatment goals to be considered in a shared decision-making process.

The results of this study should be considered with the following limitations:

- **Ethnicity**: Most participants in the CAC Consortium are white, preventing examination of ethnicity-based differences in the observed relationships.
- **Prevalence of cancer**: Information on the prevalence of cancer at the time of CAC scanning was unavailable, although it is unlikely many patients with cancer underwent CAC scanning purely for CVD risk stratification.
- **Cause of death**: Limitations exist in the ascertainment of cause of death by relying on the documentation provided by death certificates only.

### Post-mortem CT: Is coronary angiography required in the presence of a high coronary artery calcium score [^115frEaQ]. Clinical Radiology (2019). Low credibility.

To test whether a high coronary artery score predicts that the subsequent post-mortem computed tomography (PMCT) with angiography (PMCTA) will diagnose significant coronary artery disease (CAD); to test the diagnostic impact of assuming there is significant CAD based on a high coronary artery calcium (CAC) score alone; and to test whether the clinical CAC score threshold (400) is the most accurate to make this prediction, the following study was conducted.

- **Materials and methods**: CAC scoring and PMCTA were performed in cases of adult sudden natural death. Angiography was reviewed to determine if there was sufficient CAD to give as the cause of death. Data were analyzed to test whether a high calcium score predicts significant CAD.

- **Results**: PMCTA with the CAC score was successful in 100 out of 104 PMCT examinations and in 87 out of 100 angiography examinations (87%). Forty-six cases (46%) had a CAC score of > 400, indicating severe disease. CAD was given as the cause of death in 31 cases (67%) within this group. Angiography was successful in 39 of these cases (84.7%) and showed severe CAD in all but one (97%). Additionally, 25 cases (25%) were diagnosed with a CAD death without a high CAC score.

- **Conclusion**: Although the CAC score cannot diagnose or exclude death due to CAD, the addition of angiography adds little diagnostic information beyond a high CAC score. If PMCT investigation is conducted to exclude trauma and provide a medical cause of death on the "balance of probabilities", angiography is not required when the calcium score is > 400. This could reduce the number of patients requiring angiography by almost 50%.

### Coronary artery calcium score and polygenic risk score for the prediction of coronary heart disease events [^115Q49iN]. JAMA (2023). High credibility.

Coronary artery calcium score and polygenic risk score have each separately been proposed as novel markers to identify risk of coronary heart disease (CHD), but no prior studies have directly compared these markers in the same cohorts.

To evaluate change in CHD risk prediction when a coronary artery calcium score, a polygenic risk score, or both are added to a traditional risk factor-based model, two observational population-based studies were conducted. These involved individuals aged 45 to 79 years of European ancestry, free of clinical CHD at baseline. The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) involved 1,991 participants at six US centers, and the Rotterdam Study (RS) involved 1,217 participants in Rotterdam, the Netherlands.

Traditional risk factors were used to calculate CHD risk (e.g. pooled cohort equations [PCEs]), computed tomography was utilized for determining the coronary artery calcium score, and genotyped samples were used for a validated polygenic risk score.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Model discrimination, calibration, and net reclassification improvement (at the recommended risk threshold of 7.5%) for prediction of incident CHD events were assessed.

The median age was 61 years in MESA and 67 years in RS. Both log (coronary artery calcium+1) and polygenic risk score were significantly associated with a 10-year risk of incident CHD (hazard ratio per SD, 2.60; 95% CI, 2.08–3.26 and 1.43; 95% CI, 1.20–1.71, respectively) in MESA. The C statistic for the coronary artery calcium score was 0.76 (95% CI, 0.71–0.79).

### Diagnostic value of coronary artery calcium scoring in low-intermediate risk patients evaluated in the emergency department for acute coronary syndrome [^112xozLb]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

Early and accurate triage of patients with possible ischemic chest pain remains challenging in the emergency department because risk stratification techniques have significant cost and limited availability. The aim of this study was to determine the diagnostic value of the coronary artery calcium score (CACS) for the detection of obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) in low- to intermediate-risk patients evaluated in the emergency department for suspected acute coronary syndromes.

A total of 225 patients presenting to the emergency department with acute chest pain and Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) scores < 4 who underwent non-contrast- and contrast-enhanced coronary computed tomographic angiography were included. CACS was calculated from the non-contrast scan using the Agatston method. The prevalence of obstructive CAD (defined from the contrast scan as ≥ 50% maximal reduction in luminal diameter in any segment) was 9% and increased significantly with higher scores (p < 0.01 for trend). CACS of 0 were observed in 133 patients (59%), of whom only 2 (1.5%) had obstructive CAD.

The diagnostic accuracy of CACS to detect obstructive CAD was good, with an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of 0.88 and a negative predictive value of 99% for a CACS of 0. In a multivariate model, CACS was independently associated with obstructive CAD (odds ratio 7.01, p = 0.02) and provided additional diagnostic value over traditional CAD risk factors. In conclusion, CACS appears to be an effective initial tool for risk stratification of low- to intermedia.

### Risk factors for incident coronary artery calcium in younger (age 32 to 45 years) versus intermediate (46 to 64 years) versus older (65 to 84 years) persons [^116VAdKF]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2022). Low credibility.

The prognostic value of traditional atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk factors may decrease with age. We sought to determine whether the association between traditional ASCVD risk factors and incident coronary artery calcium (CAC) differs for younger versus older persons. We included 5,108 participants with baseline CAC = 0. Repeat CAC scoring occurred over 3 to 11 years of follow-up. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression assessed the association between traditional risk factors and incident CAC in young (32 to 45 years), middle-aged (46 to 64 years), and older adults (65 to 84 years). A total of 61% of the participants were women and 37% were Black. The proportion with incident CAC ranged from 22% among young adults, 34% for middle-aged adults, and 45% for older adults.

In young adults, traditional risk factors were significantly associated with incident CAC except for diastolic blood pressure and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, whereas only total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol ≥ 3.5 (p = 0.04) was significantly associated with incident CAC in older persons. Non-HDL cholesterol (p = 0.02) was more strongly associated with incident CAC in young (hazard ratio [HR] 1.20, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.09 to 1.31) and middle-aged adults (HR 1.14, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.23) compared to older adults (HR 1.11, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.23). When added to demographics, traditional risk factors provided a greater C-statistic improvement for incident CAC prediction in young (0.752, +0.070, p < 0.001) versus middle-aged (0.645, +0.054, p < 0.001) and older adults (0.597, +0.037, p < 0.001).

### Coronary artery calcium score to refine the use of PCSK9i in asymptomatic individuals: A multicohort study [^117TxNs7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Low credibility.

A PCSK9i allocation paradigm aimed at achieving low LDL‐C levels among individuals with subclinical organ damage identifies a large target population with high ASCVD event rates. Across non‐FH scenarios for PCSK9i allocation in primary prevention, CAC stratified ASCVD risk and was independently associated with ASCVD events. The value of CAC testing for identifying CAC = 0 is greater in scenarios that use LDL‐C levels and/or traditional risk factors to define PCSK9i eligibility (present in 1 of 3–4 patients), whereas the prevalence of CAC = 0 is lower when allocation is informed by the presence of noncoronary subclinical organ damage.

### Real-world evidence linking the predicting risk of cardiovascular disease events risk score and coronary artery calcium [^114b5AnF]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Low credibility.

- **Patient characteristics and CAC scores**: Presented by predicted 10-year PREVENT CVD risk score, figures are represented as mean ± SD or n (%), with CAC described as median (25th–75th percentile).
- **Violin plot of CAC scores**: Displayed by predicted 10-year PREVENT CVD risk score groups on a log scale.
- **Probability assessments**: These include Agatston score ≥ 1 and Agatston score > 100, based on the PREVENT score and modeled as cubic splines.
- **Risk discrimination**: Examines incident myocardial infarction using PREVENT alone, CAC alone, or both. Over a mean follow-up of 1.2 years, 485 events were documented. The P value indicates the difference in c-statistic from PREVENT only, with a value > 100 suggesting a moderate ASCVD plaque burden and high CVD risk. This aligns with the Cardiovascular–Kidney–Metabolic Syndrome staging system, which classifies obesity.

### The risk of death in patients with a high coronary calcification score: Does it include predialysis patients [^11279yLq]. Kidney International (2010). Low credibility.

High coronary artery calcification score (CACS) assessed by computed tomography is related to mortality in asymptomatic patients with normal kidney function. The predictive value of CACS is still disputed in patients with end-stage renal disease and is unknown in patients with pre-terminal renal failure. Chiu and co-workers provide evidence that CACS is associated with mortality also in patients with chronic kidney disease not yet on dialysis.

### Association of coronary artery calcium in adults aged 32 to 46 years with incident coronary heart disease and death [^1169itjm]. JAMA Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) is associated with coronary heart disease (CHD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD); however, prognostic data on CAC are limited in younger adults. This study sought to determine if CAC in adults aged 32 to 46 years is associated with incident clinical CHD, CVD, and all-cause mortality during 12.5 years of follow-up.

The Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study is a prospective community-based study that recruited 5,115 black and white participants aged 18 to 30 years from March 25, 1985, to June 7, 1986. The cohort has been under surveillance for 30 years, with CAC measured 15 (n = 3,043), 20 (n = 3,141), and 25 (n = 3,189) years after recruitment. The mean follow-up period for incident events was 12.5 years, from the year 15 computed tomographic scan through August 31, 2014.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Incident CHD included fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome without myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, or CHD death. Incident CVD included CHD, stroke, heart failure, and peripheral arterial disease. Death included all causes. The probability of developing CAC by age 32 to 56 years was estimated using clinical risk factors measured 7 years apart between ages 18 and 38 years.

- **Results**: At year 15 of the study among 3,043 participants (mean [SD] age, 40.3 [3.6] years; 1,383 men and 1,660 women), 309 individuals (10.2%) had CAC, with a geometric mean Agatston score of 21.6 (interquartile range, 17.3–26.8). Participants were followed up for 12.5 years.

### Point of care clinical risk score to improve the negative diagnostic utility of an Agatston score of zero: Averting the need for coronary computed tomography angiography [^114mgbrr]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Imaging (2019). Low credibility.

Coronary artery calcification is a marker of underlying atherosclerotic vascular disease. The absence of coronary artery calcification is associated with a low prevalence of obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD), but it cannot be ruled out completely. We sought to develop a clinical tool that can be added to the Agatston score of zero to rule out obstructive CAD with high accuracy.

- **Methods**: We developed a clinical score retrospectively from a cohort of 4,903 consecutive patients with an Agatston score of zero. Patients with prior diagnosis of CAD, coronary percutaneous coronary intervention, or surgical revascularization were excluded. Obstructive CAD was defined as any epicardial vessel diameter narrowing of ≥ 50%. The score was validated using an external cohort of 4,290 patients with an Agatston score of zero from a multinational registry.

- **Results**: The score consisted of seven variables: age, sex, typical chest pain, dyslipidemia, hypertension, family history, and diabetes mellitus. The model was robust with an area under the curve of 0.70 (95% CI, 0.65–0.76) in the derivation cohort and 0.69 (95% CI, 0.65–0.72) in the validation cohort. Patients were divided into three risk groups based on the score: low (≤ 6), intermediate (7–13), and high (≥ 14). Patients who score ≤ 6 have a negative likelihood ratio of 0.42 for obstructive CAD, whereas those who score ≥ 14 have a positive likelihood ratio of > 5.5 for obstructive CAD. The outcome was ruled out in > 98% of patients with a score ≤ 6 in the validation cohort.

- **Conclusions**: We developed a score that may be used to identify patients.

### Scoring of coronary artery calcium scans: History, assumptions, current limitations, and future directions [^115MUuS5]. Atherosclerosis (2015). Low credibility.

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scanning is a reliable, noninvasive technique for estimating overall coronary plaque burden and for identifying the risk of future cardiac events. Arthur Agatston and Warren Janowitz published the first technique for scoring CAC scans in 1990. Given the lack of available data correlating CAC with coronary atherosclerosis burden at that time, their scoring algorithm was remarkable but somewhat arbitrary. Since then, a few other scoring techniques have been proposed for the measurement of CAC, including the Volume score and Mass score. Yet, despite new data, little in this field has changed in the last 15 years.

The main focus of our paper is to review the implications of the approach to scoring CAC scans in terms of correlation with the central disease: coronary atherosclerosis. We first discuss the methodology of each available scoring system, describing how each of these scores makes important indirect assumptions in the way they account (or do not account) for calcium density, location of calcium, spatial distribution of calcium, and microcalcification/emerging calcium that might limit their predictive power. These assumptions require further study in well-designed, large event-driven studies.

In general, all of these scores are adequate and are highly correlated with each other. Despite its age, the Agatston score remains the most extensively studied and widely accepted technique in both the clinical and research settings. After discussing CAC scoring in the era of contrast-enhanced coronary CT angiography, we discuss suggested potent…

### What does my patient's coronary artery calcium score mean? Combining information from the coronary artery calcium score with information from conventional risk factors to estimate coronary heart disease risk [^114z8yVN]. BMC Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Age and sex were strong predictors of the presence of coronary artery calcification (CAC) in logistic regression models. There was no evidence that the effects of age were non-linear (i.e. J- or U-shaped; p-value = 0.32 for a quadratic age term). Conventional CHD risk factors were also independent predictors of the presence of CAC (p < 0.001 in all cases). The logistic model with age, sex, and all CHD risk factors produced the most accurate model (C-statistic = 0.78). The Framingham 10-year CHD risk estimate was also a very strong predictor of coronary artery calcification, though the model containing the 10-year risk estimate as the only predictor was slightly less accurate (C-statistic = 0.74).

Among patients with non-zero CAC scores, age and sex remained strong predictors of the extent of coronary artery calcification, as measured by the Ln(CAC score). Again, the effects of age appeared to be linear (p = 0.16 for the quadratic age term). All conventional CHD risk factors remained statistically significant predictors of the extent of coronary artery calcification (p < 0.001 for all predictors except high cholesterol, at p = 0.004). The Framingham 10-year CHD risk estimate was a very strong predictor of the extent of calcification, though when used alone in a model, it explained somewhat less of the variance (R² = 0.11) than the full model (R² = 0.17).

### Polygenic risk scores and extreme coronary artery calcium phenotypes (CAC = 0 and CAC ≥ 1000) in adults ≥ 75 years old: The ARIC study [^116qftd9]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Imaging (2024). High credibility.

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) is heterogeneous in older age and is incompletely explained by traditional atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk factors. The extremes of subclinical atherosclerosis burden are strongly associated with either a low or high 10-year risk of incident atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, respectively. However, the genetic underpinnings of differences in arterial aging remain unclear. We sought to determine the independent association of two polygenic scores for coronary heart disease (CHD) with CAC in adults ≥ 75 years of age.

- **Methods**: There were 1865 ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) participants who underwent genetic testing at visit 1 (1987–1989) and CAC scans at visit 7 (2018–2019). In the primary analysis, an externally derived multi-ancestry polygenic CHD risk score was calculated for both White and Black participants. Results were confirmed using a separate ARIC-derived polygenic CHD risk score, including ≥ 6 million variants computed for White participants. We used multivariable logistic regression models to assess the association of polygenic CHD risk with CAC, after adjusting for baseline, time-averaged lifestyle, traditional risk factors, and local ancestry principal components.

- **Results**: In the primary analysis, the average age was 80.6 years, 61.6% were women, and the median CAC score was 246 (189 participants with CAC = 0, 364 participants with CAC ≥ 1000). Compared with persons below the 20th percentile of polygenic CHD risk, persons with a polygenic-CHD risk above the 80th percentile had 82% lower odds of having high CAC values.

### Morphomic calcification score from clinical CT scans: A proxy for coronary artery calcium [^112dyXpy]. Clinical Imaging (2020). Low credibility.

Screening of cardiovascular risk is essential in preventing cardiac events and quantifying asymptomatic risk. Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scores are well-established in predicting cardiovascular risk, but they require specialized computed tomography (CT) scans. Given the relationship between aortic calcification and cardiovascular risk, we sought to determine whether aortic calcification measures from incidental CT scans may approximate CAC.

- **Study design**: Retrospective CT scans and corresponding volumetric CAC scores were obtained from patients at the University of Michigan. Aortic calcifications were measured in 166 scans. Correlations between a novel morphomic calcium (MC) percent score and CAC score were evaluated using Kendall's correlation coefficients. Comparison of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves based on MC at different vertebral levels showed the highest predictive values for measures taken at L4.

- **Results**: MC at L4 shows promise in predicting CAC (AUC 0.90 in non-contrast scans, 0.70 in post-contrast scans). Proposed MC threshold values are (4.21% for best sensitivity, 12.93% for balance, 19.26% for specificity) in scans without contrast enhancement and (7.31% for sensitivity, 8.06% for specificity) in scans with contrast enhancement.

- **Conclusion**: The MC score demonstrates promising potential in approximating CAC, particularly at the L4 level. The utilization of MC from incidental CT scans may be useful for the assessment of cardiovascular risk. The ability to extract MC from contrast scans makes it especially valuable to patients receiving a broader range of diagnostic imaging.

### The evolving view of coronary artery calcium and cardiovascular disease risk [^1115UWtN]. Clinical Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Calcification of the coronary artery is a complex pathophysiologic process that is intimately associated with atherosclerosis. Extensive investigation has demonstrated the value of identifying and quantifying coronary artery calcium (CAC) in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) prognostication. However, over the last several years, an increasing body of evidence has suggested that CAC has underappreciated aspects that modulate, and at times attenuate, future CVD risk. The most commonly used measure of CAC, the Agatston unit, effectively models both higher density and higher area of CAC as risk factors for future CVD events. Recent findings from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) have challenged this assumption, demonstrating that higher density of CAC is protective for coronary heart disease and CVD events. Statins may be associated with an increase in CAC, an unexpected finding given their clear benefits in the prevention and treatment of CVD. Studies utilizing intracoronary ultrasound and coronary computed tomography angiography have demonstrated that calcified atherosclerotic plaque — as compared with noncalcified or sparsely calcified plaque — is associated with fewer CVD events. These studies lend support to the often-asserted (but as yet unvalidated) view that calcification may play a role in plaque stabilization. Furthermore, vascular calcification, though a surrogate for atherosclerotic plaque burden, may also possess identifiable aspects that can refine CVD risk assessment.

### Exercise and coronary atherosclerosis: Observations, explanations, relevance, and clinical management [^113Nt4jC]. Circulation (2020). Low credibility.

Because CAC scoring is not routinely recommended, the guidelines do not clearly indicate how to proceed with additional testing in asymptomatic athletes with high CACS. The following options can be considered when evaluating an asymptomatic athlete. Management strategies differ per region in the world (e.g. United States versus Europe), country, and even per physician. Additional testing strongly depends on hospital logistics, costs, and availability of tests.

- **CCTA may be considered**: CCTA may be considered in athletes with CAC to assess the number and nature of coronary plaques and to quantify the degree of luminal narrowing. In some hospitals, all individuals with a CACS > 0 proceed to CCTA.
- **Exercise or pharmacological stress testing**: Exercise or pharmacological stress testing may also be considered to check for inducible myocardial ischemia. In individuals with CACS ≥ 400 and/or luminal stenoses > 50%, an exercise stress test or stress imaging tests should be considered to detect evidence of ischemia.
- **Evidence of ischemia**: Evidence of ischemia could prompt coronary intervention or provide guidance for setting exercise heart rate limits, suggest modification of training, and prompt consideration of additional preventive therapy such as beta blockers.
- **Invasive coronary angiography**: Some physicians may proceed to invasive coronary angiography with fractional flow reserve measurements. In the future, CCTA-based fractional flow reserve measurements may lower the need for invasive coronary angiography.

At present, there are insufficient data to provide definitive recommendations for additional testing in asymptomatic athletes with CAC. American and European guidelines are available for exercise.

### Very high coronary artery calcium score with normal myocardial perfusion SPECT imaging is associated with a moderate incidence of severe coronary artery disease [^111yesLb]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Patients with normal myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) results on SPECT have a very low cardiac event rate. It is estimated that among 1,000 patients with normal MPI, in the absence of high-risk markers, particularly transient ischemic dilation (TID), there would be an association with severe multivessel disease (MVD).

### Predictors of coronary artery calcium and long-term risks of death, myocardial infarction, and stroke in young adults [^114u9diY]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

Multiple cardiovascular guidelines recommend the use of 10-year absolute atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk estimates to guide treatment and allocation of preventive therapies. Because these scores rely heavily on patient age, nearly all young adults (younger than 50 years) are estimated to have a low 10-year ASCVD risk, even those with nonoptimal risk factors. Consequently, young adults are often not offered or are not adherent to preventive treatments despite the possibilities of subclinical atherosclerosis and elevated lifetime risk. The need for a clinical decision-making tool that identifies younger individuals at elevated cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk has led to interest in coronary artery calcification (CAC) as a direct marker of coronary artery disease.

The 2019 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines for primary prevention of ASCVD recommend CAC scoring for further risk assessment in borderline to intermediate-risk individuals — typically middle-aged adults — in whom management is uncertain. Although most studies of CAC have focused on the yield of testing middle to older-aged adults, the utility of CAC in younger populations is still not clear. The few studies in young adults examining the relationship between CAC and disease outcomes have been limited by small sample sizes, short duration of follow-up, or lack of cause-specific mortality, or were conducted in selected populations with a high prevalence of CVD risk factors. In response to increasing interest in CAC for risk assessment of young adults, we sought to provide further analysis and insight.

### Coronary artery calcium score-directed primary prevention with statins on the basis of the 2018 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/Multisociety cholesterol guidelines [^114iVMHP]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

Limitations of our study include the relatively small number of participants and modest number of outcome events. We did not account for family history. FHS participants were overwhelmingly White individuals and from the same geographic area; therefore, generalizability to other demographics warrants further study. The CAC score was evaluated at a single point in time, whereas some recommend reevaluation of risk factors and potentially the CAC score at 5 or 10 years in those with a CAC score of 0, whereas newer evidence suggests a 3- to 7-year interval.

In conclusion, 1 in 3 FHS participants at intermediate ASCVD risk could be reclassified to "no statin" on the basis of a CAC score of 0 and the 2018 guidelines. A CAC score ≥ 100th or ≥ 75th percentile was associated with a substantially higher long-term risk of ASCVD.

### What does my patient's coronary artery calcium score mean? Combining information from the coronary artery calcium score with information from conventional risk factors to estimate coronary heart disease risk [^112YLHAM]. BMC Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Finally, our analysis provides a guide for how to use the coronary artery calcium (CAC) score as a surrogate outcome when studying causes of coronary artery disease, which is a widely used study design. The central problem with this approach is the fundamentally non-normal distribution of CAC scores, making parametric statistic testing (including both simple t-tests and multivariable linear regression) invalid. To address this issue, some researchers have utilized the Ln(CAC score +1) as an outcome in linear regression analyses. However, this approach is not ideal, as the Ln(CAC score +1) remains grossly non-normal due to the high number of zero scores. Adding 1 to the CAC score makes log-transformation possible, yielding zeroes instead of negative infinity, but it does not solve the distributional problem and results in predictions that misrepresent actual CAC score distributions (see Figure 2). This observation has led others to present only non-parametric percentile data without multivariable modeling, but this method does not allow adjustment for conventional coronary heart disease (CHD) risk factors, which have proven to be strong predictors of the CAC score.

One research group employed ordinal logistic regression analysis to examine CAC scores categorized into four ordinal categories, specifically quartiles in their study sample. While this approach permits multivariable modeling with ordinal logistic regression, it does not fully exploit the continuous nature of the CAC score and may blur the important distinction between zero and non-zero scores. Our analysis suggests that a two-step approach, initially employing logistic regression, offers an improved method for handling these issues.

### What does my patient's coronary artery calcium score mean? Combining information from the coronary artery calcium score with information from conventional risk factors to estimate coronary heart disease risk [^113Kibg7]. BMC Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Combining information from conventional risk factors and the CAC score

First, we calculated the Framingham 10-year CHD risk estimate (and the corresponding 1-year risk estimate, assuming an equal event rate each year) according to published models. Next, we calculated the probability that an individual's CAC score would fall into each of four standard CAC score categories (0, 1–100, 101–400, and > 400), as described above. We obtained risk factor-adjusted relative risk (RR) estimates from a meta-analysis comparing the risk of a CHD event among persons with CAC scores of 1–100 (RR = 2.1), 101–400 (RR = 5.4), and > 400. The post-test CHD risk estimates for each CAC score category were then calculated algebraically by assuming that the overall 1-year CHD risk estimate represents an average of the 1-year risk estimates from the four CAC score categories, weighted by the probabilities that an individual's score would fall into each category. A spreadsheet that automates these calculations is attached.

### Calcium scoring: A personalized probability assessment predicts the need for additional or alternative testing to coronary CT angiography [^114GoLmA]. European Radiology (2020). Low credibility.

In conclusion, routine evaluation of CACS before coronary CTA may be advised as it significantly increases the diagnostic accuracy to identify patients in whom further testing will be needed following coronary CTA. Deferral of these patients to other diagnostic modalities might be beneficial as coronary CTA does not lead to a final decision regarding CAD management.

### Prognostic value of coronary artery calcium score, area, and density among individuals on statin therapy vs. non-users: The coronary artery calcium consortium [^1134nuDA]. Atherosclerosis (2021). Low credibility.

Statins do not decrease coronary artery calcium (CAC) and may increase existing calcification or its density. Therefore, we examined the prognostic significance of CAC among statin users at the time of CAC scanning.

Methods

We included 28,025 patients (6,151 statin-users) aged 40–75 years from the CAC Consortium. Cox regression models were used to assess the association of CAC with coronary heart disease (CHD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality. Models were adjusted for traditional CVD risk factors. Additionally, we examined the predictive performance of the CAC components, including CAC area, volume, and density, using an age- and sex-adjusted Cox regression model.

Results

Participants (mean age 53.9 ± 10.3 years, 65.0% male) were followed for a median of 11.2 years. There were 395 CVD and 182 CHD deaths. One unit increase in the log CAC score was associated with an increased risk of CVD mortality (hazard ratio (HR), 1.2; 95% CI = 1.1–1.3) and CHD mortality (HR, 1.2; 95% CI = 1.1–1.4) among statin users. There was a small but significant negative interaction between CAC score and statin use for the prediction of CHD (p-value = 0.036) and CVD mortality (p-value = 0.025). The volume score and CAC area were similarly associated with outcomes in statin users and non-users. Density was associated with CVD and CHD mortality in statin naïve patients, but not in statin users.

Conclusion

CAC scoring retains robust risk prediction in statin users, and the changing relationship of CAC density with outcomes may explain the slightly weaker relationship of CAC.

### Predictors of coronary artery calcium among 20–30-year-olds: The Coronary Artery Calcium Consortium [^115GNrCj]. Atherosclerosis (2020). Low credibility.

We sought to understand the risk factor correlates of very early coronary artery calcium (CAC), and the potential investigational value of CAC phenotyping in adults aged 20–30 years.

We studied all participants aged 20–30 years at baseline (N = 373) in the Coronary Artery Calcium Consortium, a large multi-center cohort study of patients aged 18 years or older without known atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) at baseline, referred for CAC scoring for clinical risk stratification. We described the prevalence of CAC in men and women, the frequency of risk factors by the presence of CAC (CAC = 0 vs CAC > 0), and assessed the association between traditional non-demographic CVD risk factors (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, smoking, family history of CHD, and diabetes) and prevalent CAC, using age- and sex-adjusted logistic regression models.

The mean age of the study participants was 27.5 ± 2.4 years; 324 (86.9%) had CAC = 0, and 49 (13.1%) had CAC > 0. Among the 49 participants with CAC, 38 (77.6%) were men, and the median CAC score was low at 4.6. In age- and sex-adjusted models, there was a graded increase in the odds of CAC > 0 with increasing traditional cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor burden (p = 0.001 for linear trend). Participants with ≥ 3 traditional risk factors had a statistically significant higher odds of having prevalent CAC (OR 5.57, 95% CI; 1.82–17.03) compared to participants with no risk factors.

Our study demonstrates the non-negligible prevalence of CAC among very high-risk young US adults.

### Comparison of coronary artery calcium scores among patients referred for cardiac imaging tests [^113mYQFz]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2023). High credibility.

While coronary artery calcium (CAC) can now be evaluated by multiple imaging modalities, there is presently scant study regarding how CAC scores may vary among populations of varying clinical risk.

- **Methods**: We evaluated the distribution of CAC scores among three patient groups: 18,941 referred for CAC scanning, 5,101 referred for diagnostic coronary CT angiography (CCTA), and 3,307 referred for diagnostic positron emission tomography (PET) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI). We assessed the relationship between CAC score and myocardial ischemia, obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD), and all-cause mortality across imaging modalities.

- **Results**: Within each age group, the frequency of CAC abnormalities was relatively similar across testing modalities, despite an annualized mortality rate which varied from 0.5%/year among CAC patients to 3.8%/year among PET-MPI patients (p < 0.001). Among CCTA and PET-MPI patients, a zero CAC score was common, occurring in approximately 70% of patients under 50 years, approximately 40% of patients aged 50–59 years, and approximately 25% of patients aged 60–69 years. Among CCTA patients, zero CAC was associated with a normal coronary angiogram with high frequency, ranging from 92.2% among patients under 50 years to 87.9% among patients 70 years and older. Among PET-MPI patients, zero CAC was associated with a very low frequency of inducible ischemia across all age groups, ranging from 1.5% among patients under 50 years to 0.9% among patients 70 years and older.

- **Conclusions**: In our study, relatively similar CAC scores were noted among patients varying markedly in mortality risk. Clinically, zero CAC scores appear consistently associated with normal imaging outcomes across different modalities and age groups.

### Coronary artery calcium scanning: Clinical paradigms for cardiac risk assessment and treatment [^1141k4N3]. American Heart Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scanning is being increasingly used for cardiac risk assessment in asymptomatic patients, particularly in those with a Framingham 10-year risk of 10% to 20%. Physician awareness of this technology and its appropriate uses and limitations is crucial to its proper use.

- **Methods**: With the goal of establishing clinical paradigms, this document integrates the results of key published articles, the Framingham Risk Score, National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines, American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association exercise testing, angiographic guidelines, and the authors' extensive clinical experience.

- **Results**: Coronary artery calcium scanning is best used in the asymptomatic population with a 10% to 20% risk of cardiac events over 10 years, with selected application in higher and lower risk categories. In the 10%-20% risk patient group, coronary artery calcium scores > 100 or > 75th percentile for age and sex transform the moderately high-risk patient to higher risk status, leading to the recommendation for more aggressive therapy. Scores from 11 to 100 and > 400 should always precede coronary angiography in these patients.

- **Conclusions**: Coronary artery calcium scanning is an important risk assessment tool.

### Coronary artery calcification in black women and white women [^111U4tLS]. American Heart Journal (2003). Low credibility.

Coronary calcification is a potent independent predictor of coronary risk. Sex-specific risk categories based on calcium scores have been established, but ethnic differences in coronary calcification have been little studied. This prospective cohort study compares coronary calcification, assessed by computed tomography, in postmenopausal black women and white women.

- **Methods and results**: Computed tomographic scans were performed on 128 black women and 733 white women without known coronary artery disease (mean age 63 ± 8 years). Although coronary risk factors were more prevalent among black women (P < 0.0001), total calcium scores were similar to those in white women. By use of the Framingham algorithm, higher calcium scores were associated with higher 10-year risk of myocardial infarction or coronary death. In multiple regression analysis, age was independently associated with higher calcium scores in both ethnic groups (P = 0.002 for black women, P < 0.0001 for white women). Diabetes mellitus and not exercising at least 3 times per week were independently associated with higher calcium scores in white women but not black women. Educational level, body mass index, hormone replacement therapy, hysterectomy, dietary fat consumption, family history of premature coronary disease, hypertension, self-reported high cholesterol, and smoking were not independently associated with coronary calcium score in black women, white women, or the combined cohort. Neither was ethnicity an independent predictor of coronary calcification.

### Cardiovascular lifetime risk predicts incidence of coronary calcification in individuals with low short-term risk: The Dallas Heart Study [^114jT61p]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

The absence of coronary artery calcium (CAC) in middle age is associated with very low short-term risk for coronary events. However, the long-term implications of a CAC score of 0 are uncertain, particularly among individuals with high cardiovascular lifetime risk. We sought to characterize the association between predicted lifetime risk and incident CAC among individuals with low short-term risk.

- **Methods and results**: We included 754 Dallas Heart Study participants with serial CAC scans (6.9 years apart) and both low short-term risk and baseline CAC = 0. Lifetime risk for cardiovascular disease was estimated according to risk factor burden. Among this group, 365 individuals (48.4%) were at low lifetime risk and 389 (51.6%) at high lifetime risk. High lifetime risk was associated with higher annualized CAC incidence (4.2% versus 2.7%; P < 0.001). Similarly, mean follow-up CAC scores were higher among participants with high lifetime risk (7.8 versus 2.4 Agatston units). After adjustment for age, sex, and race, high lifetime risk remained independently associated with incident CAC (OR 1.60; 95% CI 1.12 to 2.27; P = 0.01). When assessing risk factor burden at the follow-up visit, 66.7% of CAC incidence observed in the low lifetime risk group occurred among individuals reclassified to a higher short- or long-term risk category.

- **Conclusion**: Among individuals with low short-term risk and CAC scores of 0, high lifetime risk is associated with a higher incidence of CAC. These findings highlight the importance of lifetime risk even among individuals with very low short-term risk.

### Is calcium scoring of the coronary arteries necessary for proper management of asymptomatic subjects with classic risk factors [^115TjVQQ]. Clinical Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

In 2000, I wrote an editorial entitled, "Detecting Coronary Calcium". For the past several years, there have been numerous publications on this subject. Recently, an article by Min et al. provided some important information about patients with a normal coronary calcium scan and the conversion from a zero calcium score to greater than zero.

### Predictive values of coronary artery calcium and arterial stiffness for long-term cardiovascular events in patients with stable coronary artery disease [^113LHp9Q]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). Low credibility.

Contrary to CAVI, the CAC score is more widely used, and studies support its use as a screening test to guide treatment in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Our findings support the hypothesis that adding a high CAC score (≥ 100) into the model, which contained only clinical risk factors, could increase the magnitude of MACE risk beyond that obtained from clinical risk factors alone. Similar to the MESA findings, participants with CAC scores ≥ 100 have more than a 4.2-fold higher risk for a CAD event and a 2.8-fold higher risk for a CVD event compared with those with a CAC score of 0. A CAC score ≥ 100 is also strongly associated, and in a graded fashion, with a 10-year risk of ASCVD (including stroke) above 7.5%. In the recent 2019 ACC/AHA guidelines on primary prevention of CVD, CAC score was the only noninvasive test recommended to guide statin prescription in intermediate-risk patients with a CAC score ≥ 100.

The role of aspirin in the primary prevention of ASCVD is still controversial. Preliminary findings suggest that a CAC score may also help guide decisions for initiating (or deferring) antiplatelet therapy for primary prevention. Recently, MESA researchers suggested that patients with CAC scores ≥ 100 may be good candidates for aspirin therapy for primary prevention, although the net benefit is expected to be modest. Importantly, in patients with a CAC score of zero, the risk of bleeding appears to be greater than the potential benefit, so aspirin therapy for primary prevention should be avoided.

### Improving cardiovascular disease prediction using automated coronary artery calcium scoring from existing chest CTs [^1125jUAR]. Journal of Digital Imaging (2022). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) prediction models are widely used in modern medicine and are incorporated into prominent guidelines. Coronary artery calcium (CAC) is a marker of coronary atherosclerotic disease and has proven utility for predicting cardiovascular disease. Despite this, guidelines recommend against including CAC scores in CVD prediction models due to the medical and financial costs of acquiring it and the insufficient evidence concerning its ability to improve existing models. Modern machine learning models can automatically extract coronary calcium scores from existing chest computed tomography (CT) scans, negating these costs.

To determine whether the inclusion of CAC scores, automatically extracted using a machine learning algorithm from chest CTs performed for any reason, improves the performance of the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology 2013 pooled cohort equations (PCE), a retrospective cohort of patients with available chest CTs prior to an index date (2012) was used. The study compared the performance of the PCE model and an augmented-PCE model, which utilizes the CT-based CAC scores on top of the existing model.

The PCE and the augmented-PCE predictions were calculated as of an index date (2012) using data from the electronic health record and existing chest CTs. The performance of both models was evaluated by comparing their predictions to cardiovascular events that occurred during a 5-year follow-up period (until 2017). A total of 14,135 patients aged 40–79 years were included in the study, of whom 470 (3.3%) had documented cardiovascular events.

### Cardiovascular risk assessment in patients with diabetes [^112bW6Qt]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2017). Low credibility.

Assessment of subclinical atherosclerosis

- **Coronary artery calcium score (CAC)**: Coronary arterial calcification is part of the development of atherosclerosis, occurring almost exclusively in atherosclerotic arteries and being absent in normal vessel walls. Atherosclerotic plaque proceeds through progressive stages where instability and rupture can be followed by calcification, providing stability to an unstable lesion. Coronary artery calcium score (CAC) is determined by electron-beam (EBCT) and multi-detector (MDCT) computed tomography. It has a strong correlation with the total coronary atherosclerotic burden and is able to define CHD risk, being an independent predictor of cardiovascular disease.

The MESA Study compared the improvement in prediction of incident CHD and CVD between six risk markers in 6814 patients, 1330 of whom were at intermediate risk as determined by the Framingham risk score (FRS) at baseline. After a 7.6-year median follow-up, there were 94 CHD and 123 CVD events. The baseline accuracy ROC curve for CAC afforded the highest increment of sensitivity and specificity to the FRS compared to all other markers. CAC score has an incremental relationship with higher event rates when compared to a CAC zero score. A meta-analysis evaluating the prognostic value of CAC from four studies in asymptomatic subjects indicated a linear relationship between CAC and CHD events. The summary adjusted relative risk ratios for scores ranging from CAC 1–100 compared to CAC zero was 2.1 (95% CI 1.6–2.9). The relative risk for CAC 101–400 and CAC > 400 compared to CAC zero ranged from 3.0 to 17.0.

### Coronary artery calcium: Where do we stand after over 3 decades [^113xX2Fc]. The American Journal of Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

In 2018, cardiovascular society cholesterol guidelines recommended the use of coronary artery calcium to guide statin therapy in patients aged 40–79 years who are at intermediate risk by multiple risk factor equations (i.e. estimated 10-year risk for atherosclerotic disease of 7.5%-19.9% but in whom statin benefit is uncertain). Many such patients have no coronary calcium and remain at < 5% risk over the next decade; hence, statin therapy can be delayed until a repeat calcium scan is conducted. Exceptions include patients with severe hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, and a strong family history of atherosclerotic disease.

- **If coronary calcium equals 1–99 Agatston units**: The 10-year risk is borderline (5% to < 7.5%), and statin therapy is optional pending a repeat scan.
- **If coronary calcium equals 100–299 Agatston units**: The patient is clearly statin eligible (7.5% to < 20% 10-year risk).
- **And finally, if coronary calcium is ≥ 300 Agatston units**: A patient is at high risk and is a candidate for high-intensity statins.

Risk factor analysis combined judiciously with coronary calcium scanning offers the strongest evidence-based approach to the use of statins in primary prevention.

### What does my patient's coronary artery calcium score mean? Combining information from the coronary artery calcium score with information from conventional risk factors to estimate coronary heart disease risk [^1118LpsV]. BMC Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

The third and fourth clinical scenarios presented provide examples where the test is unlikely to change management. For instance, the 40-year-old woman who smokes has a very low pre-test 10-year coronary heart disease (CHD) risk of 3%. It is very likely her coronary artery calcium (CAC) score will be zero (89%) or less than 100 (10%). In such cases, her post-test 10-year CHD risk will still be low (≤ 5%) and her management would not change. Similarly, the 80-year-old man with high cholesterol has a high pre-test 10-year CHD risk (26%) and a high probability of a high CAC score (70% will have a score > 100). Consequently, his post-test 10-year CHD risk would remain over 20%, and his management would have to remain aggressive. In scenarios where the risk factor profile indicates very low or very high pre-test risk, the test is not likely to provide valuable results, and the clinician might decide not to order the test. A simple spreadsheet has been provided (see Additional File 1) for readers of this article to replicate these analyses and apply our models to other clinical scenarios.

While others have proposed similar Bayesian approaches to the use of the CAC score for coronary risk prediction, ours has advantages. Previous approaches generally take into account the pre-test probability of coronary heart disease, but none consider the expected distribution of CAC scores in the tested population after adjusting for conventional CHD risk factors. Raggi et al. advocate the use of an age- and sex-adjusted calcium score percentile, but this ignores both persons with zero scores.

### Coronary calcium characteristics as predictors of major adverse cardiac events in symptomatic patients: Insights from the CORE 320 multinational study [^11735D7i]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

In patients, risk stratification of cardiovascular disease and coronary heart disease is critical for determining clinical management. Coronary artery calcium (CAC) is a component of atherosclerosis almost solely found in atherosclerotic arteries. Measured by noncontrast cardiac-gated computed tomography (CT), CAC has proved to be an important subclinical predictor of incident cardiovascular disease, and scoring of CAC is considered one of the best subclinical cardiovascular disease measures for risk prediction of cardiovascular events. Together with traditional risk factors, CAC scoring can be used to calculate an accurate estimate of the 10-year coronary heart disease risk. Conversely, the absence of CAC is associated with good prognosis. Although mostly performed in asymptomatic individuals, there is evidence that CAC scoring also has prognostic value in symptomatic populations.

Assessment of the extent of CAC is of importance for prediction as well as for diagnostic and therapeutic considerations. Beyond the Agatston calcium score, other characteristics, such as the calcium area, volume, mass, and density of plaques in coronary arteries, can be obtained from coronary calcium scanning. Several studies have shown associations between CAC density and risk of cardiovascular events and mortality. However, little is known about the predictive value of specific characteristics of CAC in symptomatic individuals. The aim of this study is to determine to what extent these specific CAC characteristics are…

### The latest on the calcium story [^1124w8qG]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2002). Low credibility.

Coronary calcium scanning is no longer restricted to specialized centers but has become widely available as a test that can easily be performed in clinical practice. There have been parallel developments in the scientific evaluation of coronary calcium scanning in numerous research studies and in the practical use of this test. A number of reports have clarified the relation between unstable coronary plaque and coronary calcium. Whereas calcium is a frequent feature of plaque rupture, there is too much overlap with more stable plaques to be specific. However, data are accumulating to indicate that calcium is associated with coronary atherosclerotic disease activity.

Indeed, reports presented within the past year have demonstrated that very high calcium scores, particularly those greater than 1,000, indicate a significantly increased cardiovascular risk. The advent of cardiac spiral computed tomography (CT) has made coronary calcium scanning widely available. As this methodology is continuously evolving, a number of challenges regarding the standardization of test ordering, performance, and interpretation have arisen. Currently, 4-slice spiral CT scanners are most widely used. Protocols with prospective or retrospective electrocardiographic triggering are used, which appear to yield results similar to the Agatston coronary calcium score compared with electron-beam CT, despite the technical differences. New scoring algorithms are being evaluated. With electron-beam and spiral CT, we have, for the first time, a readily available test for the direct diagnostic visualization of the coronary arteries.

The Clinical Research Roundtable at the Institute of Medicine has identified the translation of clinical research findings into improvements in medical care as the "next scientific frontier". While our analysis has some limitations, it provides a methodology that will directly assist in the translation of research into practice. Our models, once validated, can be used directly by patients and clinicians to decide when it might be useful to order this potentially expensive test and what to do with the results.

### Is there a role for coronary artery calcium scoring for management of asymptomatic patients at risk for coronary artery disease? Clinical risk scores are not sufficient to define primary prevention treatment strategies among asymptomatic patients [^114yJ9C3]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Imaging (2014). High credibility.

Although risk factors have proven to be useful therapeutic targets, they are poor predictors of risk. Traditional risk scores are moderately successful in predicting future CHD events and can be a starting place for general risk categorization. However, there is substantial heterogeneity between traditional risk and actual atherosclerosis burden, with event rates predominantly driven by the burden of atherosclerosis. Serum biomarkers have yet to show any clinically significant incremental value to the FRS, and even when combined, they cannot match the predictive value of atherosclerosis imaging.

As clinicians, we must ask ourselves if we are willing to base therapy decisions on risk models that lack optimum-achievable accuracy and limit personalization. The decision to treat a patient in primary prevention must be made carefully because the benefit of therapy in an asymptomatic patient must clearly outweigh the potential risk. CAC, in particular, provides a personalized assessment of risk and may identify patients who will be expected to derive the most and the least net absolute benefit from treatment. Emerging evidence hints that CAC may also promote long-term adherence to aspirin, exercise, diet, and statin therapy.

When potentially lifelong treatment decisions are on the line, clinicians must arm their patients with the most accurate risk prediction tools, and subclinical atherosclerosis testing with CAC is, at present, superior to any combination of risk factors and serum biomarkers.
