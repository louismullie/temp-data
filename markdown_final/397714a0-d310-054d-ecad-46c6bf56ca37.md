## Question

what is the lab workup for lactose intolerance

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the lab workup for lactose intolerance. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the clinical question and distinguishing lactose malabsorption from lactose intolerance. Then, I should verify the diagnostic gold standard and why it is impractical. Next, I will review noninvasive test options and their performance, including hydrogen breath testing, genetic testing, lactose tolerance testing, and gaxilose. After that, I need to consider special populations and confounders like SIBO, IBS, and secondary causes. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise algorithm and highlight limitations and what would change my approach, anchoring on high-quality reviews and guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: lactose intolerance is the symptomatic phenotype that occurs when lactose malabsorption produces abdominal pain, bloating, flatulence, or diarrhea after lactose ingestion, whereas lactose malabsorption is the failure to digest/absorb lactose and may be asymptomatic, so I need to ensure I'm recommending tests that capture both physiology and symptoms rather than malabsorption alone.

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about a single "best" test; I should verify the gold standard. Direct measurement of lactase activity on jejunal biopsy is the reference standard, but it is invasive, subject to sampling error due to patchy expression, and rarely indicated for lactose intolerance alone, so it is not the routine first-line test in ambulatory care [^998e489c] [^fc072cb6].

> Next, I should review hydrogen breath testing, which is the most widely used and practical first-line test. Wait, let me verify the dose and thresholds: a 25 g lactose load with serial breath sampling over about 2–3 hours and a rise in hydrogen ≥ 20 ppm above baseline is diagnostic of lactose malabsorption, and adding methane measurement improves sensitivity because methane producers consume hydrogen; a three-sample strategy (baseline, 60–90 min, 120 min) performs well and balances accuracy with feasibility [^fc072cb6] [^3b4dbfeb] [^915ea6b8].

> I need to check confounders that can blunt hydrogen or mimic malabsorption. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth can cause false positives, so if SIBO is suspected, it should be treated or excluded first; conversely, non–hydrogen producers or those with predominant methane can have false negatives if methane is not measured, so combined H2/CH4 testing is prudent when available [^fc072cb6] [^915ea6b8].

> Let me consider genetic testing next. In populations of European ancestry, the C/T −13910 polymorphism in MCM6 upstream of LCT strongly predicts lactase persistence, but I should confirm that this does not generalize to all ancestries; indeed, other regions have different LP alleles, and genetic testing will miss secondary lactase deficiency from mucosal injury, so a negative genetic test does not exclude clinically relevant lactose malabsorption [^7e63aded] [^c6f16acb] [^935ac5b0].

> I will now examine the lactose tolerance test, which measures plasma glucose after a lactose load. A rise less than about 20 mg/dL above baseline suggests malabsorption, but wait, I should double-check its limitations: it is less sensitive than breath testing, requires multiple blood draws, and can be confounded by insulin resistance or variable gastric emptying, so I should reserve it for settings where breath testing is unavailable or contraindicated [^998e489c] [^notfound].

> But wait, what about gaxilose? The gaxilose test is a noninvasive probe of lactase activity measuring urinary or serum D-xylose after a specific substrate; manufacturer-sponsored data suggest high accuracy, yet independent studies show lower concordance and sensitivity than breath testing, so I should be cautious and not overstate its role in routine practice [^f4a3d6bc] [^aee14898].

> Next, I should review special populations and contexts. In children, hydrogen breath testing is acceptable and noninvasive, but I need to ensure I exclude cow's milk protein allergy and other organic disease when red flags are present; in suspected secondary lactose malabsorption from celiac disease, IBD, or infectious enteritis, I should treat the underlying condition and reassess lactose tolerance after mucosal healing rather than relying on a single static test [^0b674746] [^935ac5b0].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of testing in IBS and other functional disorders. Routine lactose breath testing is not recommended in typical IBS because results rarely change management and symptoms often reflect visceral hypersensitivity rather than lactose malabsorption; however, if symptoms persist despite empiric dietary measures, targeted testing can be considered to clarify contributory factors and guide dietetics [^707ed0ec] [^7a174b1c] [^71bdac81].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm. First, confirm the clinical suspicion with a careful history and a structured dietary trial of lactose exclusion for 1–2 weeks with symptom tracking; if symptoms resolve and recur on reintroduction, that supports lactose intolerance and may obviate further testing. If uncertainty remains or if objective confirmation is needed, proceed to hydrogen breath testing with methane when available, interpreting results in the context of dose, timing, and SIBO risk. Reserve genetic testing for epidemiologic interest or when ancestry-specific LP variants are relevant, and consider gaxilose or lactose tolerance testing only when breath testing is not feasible or results are discordant with the clinical picture [^71bdac81] [^fc072cb6] [^7e63aded].

> I should double-check limitations and what would change my approach. There is no perfect test, and symptom–test discordance is common due to visceral hypersensitivity, microbiome differences, and dose effects; thus, a negative test does not negate a clinically meaningful lactose-related symptom pattern, and a positive test does not mandate strict lifelong avoidance, since most lactose malabsorbers tolerate 12–15 g lactose (about 1 cup of milk) when taken with meals and can use lactase supplements or adapted dairy products [^18f5fa1e] [^96a9408e] [^39478b19].

> In summary, the most evidence-aligned lab workup prioritizes hydrogen breath testing with methane as the first-line objective test when needed, with genetic testing as an adjunct in select populations and lactose tolerance or gaxilose reserved for specific scenarios; always integrate results with symptom assessment and the clinical context to avoid overdiagnosis and unnecessary dietary restriction [^fc072cb6] [^7e63aded] [^11452b24].

The lab workup for lactose intolerance centers on **hydrogen breath testing** as the first-line test, with **genetic testing** as a confirmatory or adjunctive option when needed [^fc072cb6] [^7e63aded]. Hydrogen breath testing is noninvasive, widely available, and detects lactose malabsorption by measuring hydrogen produced from colonic fermentation; a rise ≥ 20 ppm from baseline is diagnostic [^fc072cb6] [^915ea6b8]. Genetic testing for LCT promoter variants (e.g. −13910 C/T) confirms primary lactase non-persistence but does not assess symptoms or secondary causes [^7e63aded] [^c6f16acb]. Lactose tolerance testing (blood glucose) is less sensitive and not preferred, and stool tests are not recommended [^391a36f9]. Choose testing based on clinical context, availability, and patient preference, and interpret results alongside symptoms and diet history [^18f5fa1e].

---

## Hydrogen breath test (HBT)

- **Principle**: Detects hydrogen from colonic fermentation of undigested lactose; humans do not produce hydrogen, so any increase reflects bacterial fermentation [^eba0a140].
- **Procedure**: Fast overnight, then ingest 25–50 g lactose; measure breath hydrogen at baseline and every 30 minutes for 2–3 hours [^915ea6b8].
- **Interpretation**: A rise ≥ 20 ppm from baseline indicates lactose malabsorption [^fc072cb6] [^391a36f9].
- **Advantages**: Noninvasive, widely available, and correlates with symptoms; allows simultaneous symptom assessment [^fc072cb6] [^998e489c].
- **Limitations**: False negatives in methane producers; false positives with SIBO; diet and antibiotics can affect results [^fc072cb6] [^57923464].

---

## Genetic testing

- **Principle**: Detects LCT promoter variants (e.g. −13910 C/T) that determine lactase persistence/non-persistence [^c6f16acb].
- **Procedure**: PCR-based assays on blood or saliva [^7e63aded].
- **Interpretation**: CC genotype indicates lactase non-persistence; CT/TT indicate persistence [^c6f16acb].
- **Advantages**: High specificity, noninvasive, and not affected by diet or antibiotics [^aee14898].
- **Limitations**: Does not assess symptoms or secondary lactase deficiency; variants differ by ancestry, reducing sensitivity in some populations [^7e63aded] [^935ac5b0].

---

## Lactose tolerance test (LTT)

The lactose tolerance test measures **blood glucose** after a lactose load; failure of glucose to rise indicates malabsorption [^391a36f9]. It is less sensitive than HBT, requires multiple blood draws, and is affected by glucose metabolism and gastric emptying; therefore, it is not preferred when HBT is available [^391a36f9] [^57923464].

---

## Stool tests

Stool tests are **not recommended** for lactose intolerance because they lack accuracy and specificity [^notfound].

---

## Summary of diagnostic tests

| **Test** | **Principle** | **Advantages** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Hydrogen breath test | Colonic fermentation | Noninvasive; correlates with symptoms | False negatives/positives; diet/ antibiotics affect results |
| Genetic testing | LCT variants | High specificity; noninvasive | Does not assess symptoms; ancestry-dependent |
| Lactose tolerance test | Blood glucose | Simple | Less sensitive; invasive; affected by metabolism |
| Stool tests | Not specified | Not recommended | Inaccurate; nonspecific |

---

## Clinical considerations

- **Primary lactase deficiency**: Use HBT or genetic testing; genetic testing confirms the diagnosis [^fc072cb6] [^7e63aded].
- **Secondary lactase deficiency**: Use HBT; genetic testing is not helpful [^fc072cb6] [^7e63aded].
- **Pediatric patients**: HBT is preferred; genetic testing can be considered [^0b674746] [^f098a536].
- **Elderly patients**: HBT is preferred; genetic testing is less informative due to age-related decline [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion

Hydrogen breath testing is the **first-line test** for lactose intolerance, with genetic testing as a confirmatory or adjunctive option. Lactose tolerance testing is less sensitive and not preferred, and stool tests are not recommended. Test selection should be individualized based on clinical context, availability, and patient preference, with results interpreted alongside symptoms and diet history [^fc072cb6] [^7e63aded] [^18f5fa1e].

Introduction

Lactose metabolism continuous to fascinate anthropologists, geneticists, physiologists and clinicians. Studying the mechanisms of lactose digestion and intolerance has provided insights not only into dietary causes of functional intestinal symptoms but also into human evolution and nutrition, culture and lifestyle (box 1). Recent evidence has demonstrated the impact of lactose digestion on the human microbiota and general health. Considering these issues has raised possible concerns of a dairy-free diet. This review will emphasise recent developments in the clinical diagnosis and management of this condition (box 2).

Testing for lactose malabsorption and intolerance

Five tests of lactose digestion are available, each of which investigates different aspects of the process and has specific advantages and disadvantages (table 4).

Table 4
Brief characterisation of the diagnostic tests available for lactose malabsorption

Genetic tests apply real-time PCR or sequencing on DNA extracted from a venous blood or buccal swab sample and are most appropriate in epidemiological studies. In Caucasians, LP is nearly uniformly mediated by the LCT-13910:C/T polymorphism, and genetic testing can detect genetic LNP. However, the genetic situation is more complex in patients with African or Asian heritage (table 3) and genetic tests are currently not advocated in these populations for clinical purposes. Importantly, secondary LM will not be detected by genetic tests.

Testing for lactose intolerance

The major limitation of the genetic, enzymatic and gaxilose tests is that LM is common in healthy individuals, and a positive test does not confirm that symptoms are caused by this condition. For this reason, in our practice, HBT is the method of choice because reasonably reliable information about digestive function and patient symptoms are obtained.

The diagnosis of LI requires appropriate testing of symptoms using validated questionnaires designed for the purpose. A National Institute of Health consensus conference defined LI as 'the onset of GI symptoms following a blinded, single-dose challenge of ingested lactose by an individual with LM, which are not observed when the person ingests an indistinguishable placebo', thus supporting the case for blinded testing of symptoms. Although rarely performed outside clinical studies, blinded testing might be useful since in clinical practice, the correlation between self-reported symptoms of LI and objective findings on tests for lactose digestion is low. Indeed, among individuals referred for HBT, about half of those with normal lactose digestion report abdominal discomfort after an unblinded lactose challenge. Further, intolerance to dairy products is reported by 20% of all individualsand up to 70% of IBS patients in European populations with low rates of genetic LNP.

A 'blinded multiple dose challenge' would provide clarity not only regarding lactose digestion but also identify the amount of lactose that individuals could 'safely' consume (figure 6). Moreover, in subjects with known LNP, these could be performed at patients' homes with a negative control, low and intermediate lactose challenge (eg, 12.5 and 25 g, corresponding to 250 and 500 mL milk, respectively). This could help educate patients because, in real life, it is self-reported intolerance and not the objective results of testing that best predicts food choices. However, to the best of our knowledge, blinded home-based testing has not been tested in routine clinical practice. The need for a well-accepted, practical and cost-effective investigation of food intolerance that predicts the outcome of dietary therapy is a key clinical challenge in functional GI disorders. The ability to predict the outcome of dietary therapy would be the measure for an appropriate symptom assessment.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for milk protein allergy, more specifically with respect to diagnosis, BSACI 2014 guidelines recommend to suspect lactose intolerance in patients presenting only with typical gastrointestinal symptoms, recognizing that lactose intolerance can be confused with non-IgE-mediated cow's milk allergy as symptoms overlap, and the terms are thus frequently mistakenly used interchangeably.

Epidemiology

A recent meta-analysis estimated the prevalence of LM worldwide at 68% with higher rates reported for genetic tests than hydrogen breath tests (HBTs).LM is lowest in Nordic countries (< 5% in Denmark) and highest in Korean and Han Chinese populations (approaches 100%). Large variations in LM are seen on a regional level (figure 2), reflecting the underlying genetic heritage and prevalence of primary LD in these populations. Testing for LI is more complex and would require standardised hydrogen breath testing in large, carefully selected populations and, for this reason, the prevalence of LI is unknown.

Outlook

Primary genetic LP and non-persistence are common in healthy humans; however, ingestion of milk by individuals with LD leads to LM and, in susceptible patients, to symptoms of lactose intolerance. Diagnosis is based on detection either of the genetic mutation, loss of lactase activity in the enteric mucosa or evidence of malabsorption by breath tests. However, the association between self-reported LI, objective findings of tests and clinical outcome of dietary intervention is variable. Recent studies have provided important new insight into the complex relationship between LD, LM and symptom generation. This work has shed light on the important issue of food intolerance as a cause of symptoms in IBS and other functional GI disorders.

The development of a well-accepted, practical and cost-effective investigation of food intolerance that predicts the outcome of dietary therapy is one of the biggest clinical challenges in the field of functional GI disorders. Understanding the biological mechanism for food intolerance will help clinicians make a definitive diagnosis and guide rational dietary and medical management. Ongoing studies will provide high-quality evidence to document the clinical outcome, cost-effectiveness and long-term effects of these strategies.

### Clinical implications of lactose malabsorption versus lactose intolerance [^931af0f9]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

The majority of the world's adult population and an estimated 80 million Americans are hypolactasic and hence malabsorb ingested lactose. Although lactose malabsorption is easily identified, less readily assessed is the clinically important question of how often does this malabsorption induce symptoms. This review summarizes: (1) knowledge concerning the etiology and diagnosis of hypolactasia and the pathophysiology of the symptoms of lactose malabsorption and (2) the results of well-controlled trials of the symptomatic response of lactose malabsorbers to varying dosages of lactose and the efficacy of therapeutic interventions to alleviate these symptoms. We conclude that the clinical significance of lactose malabsorption has been overestimated by both the lay public and physicians in that commonly ingested doses of lactose (ie, the quantity in a cup of milk) usually do not cause perceptible symptoms when ingested with a meal. Symptoms occur when the lactose dosage exceeds that in a cup of milk or when lactose is ingested without other nutrients. Simple dietary instruction, rather than the use of commercial products to reduce lactose intake, is recommended for the vast majority of lactose-malabsorbing subjects.

### 2017 Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of infectious diarrhea [^6042d5fc]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Follow-up evaluations after laboratory-confirmed pathogen-specific diarrhea — Follow-up testing is not recommended in most people for case management following resolution of diarrhea (strong, moderate), although serial stool specimens using culture-dependent methods for Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Paratyphi, STEC, Shigella, nontyphoidal Salmonella, and other bacterial pathogens are recommended in certain situations by local health authorities following cessation of diarrhea to enable return to child care, employment, or group social activities (strong, moderate), and practitioners should collaborate with local public health authorities to adhere to return policies (strong, high). A clinical and laboratory reevaluation may be indicated in people who do not respond to an initial course of therapy and should include consideration of noninfectious conditions including lactose intolerance (weak, low). Noninfectious conditions, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), should be considered in people with symptoms lasting 14 or more days and unidentified sources (strong, moderate). Reassessment of fluid and electrolyte balance, nutritional status, and optimal dose and duration of antimicrobial therapy is recommended in people with persistent symptoms (strong, high).

### Update on lactose malabsorption and intolerance: pathogenesis, diagnosis and clinical management [^96790313]. Gut (2019). Medium credibility.

Lactose is the main source of calories in milk, an essential nutriedigestion, patients with visceral hypersensitivity nt in infancy and a key part of the diet in populations that maintain the ability to digest this disaccharide in adulthood. Lactase deficiency (LD) is the failure to express the enzyme that hydrolyses lactose into galactose and glucose in the small intestine. The genetic mechanism of lactase persistence in adult Caucasians is mediated by a single C→T nucleotide polymorphism at the LCTbo −13'910 locus on chromosome-2. Lactose malabsorption (LM) refers to any cause of failure to digest and/or absorb lactose in the small intestine. This includes primary genetic and also secondary LD due to infection or other conditions that affect the mucosal integrity of the small bowel. Lactose intolerance (LI) is defined as the onset of abdominal symptoms such as abdominal pain, bloating and diarrhoea after lactose ingestion by an individual with LM. The likelihood of LI depends on the lactose dose, lactase expression and the intestinal microbiome. Independent of lactose digestion, patients with visceral hypersensitivity associated with anxiety or the Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) are at increased risk of the condition. Diagnostic investigations available to diagnose LM and LI include genetic, endoscopic and physiological tests. The association between self-reported LI, objective findings and clinical outcome of dietary intervention is variable. Treatment of LI can include low-lactose diet, lactase supplementation and, potentially, colonic adaptation by prebiotics. The clinical outcome of these treatments is modest, because lactose is just one of a number of poorly absorbed carbohydrates which can cause symptoms by similar mechanisms.

### Lactose intolerance [^e9b004a1]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Persons with lactose intolerance are unable to digest significant amounts of lactose because of a genetically inadequate amount of the enzyme lactase. Common symptoms include abdominal pain and bloating, excessive flatus, and watery stool following the ingestion of foods containing lactose. Lactase deficiency is present in up to 15 percent of persons of northern European descent, up to 80 percent of blacks and Latinos, and up to 100 percent of American Indians and Asians. A sizable number of adults believe they are lactose intolerant but do not actually have impaired lactose digestion, and some persons with lactase deficiency can tolerate moderate amounts of ingested lactose. A diagnosis of lactose intolerance can usually be made with a careful history supported by dietary manipulation. If necessary, diagnosis can be confirmed by using a breath hydrogen or lactose tolerance test. Treatment consists primarily of avoiding lactose-containing foods. Lactase enzyme supplements may be helpful. The degree of lactose malabsorption varies greatly among patients with lactose intolerance, but most of them can ingest up to 12 oz of milk daily without symptoms. Lactose-intolerant patients must ensure adequate calcium intake.

### BSACI guideline for the diagnosis and management of cow's milk allergy [^68c2eeff]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2014). Low credibility.

This guideline advises on the management of patients with cow's milk allergy. Cow's milk allergy presents in the first year of life with estimated population prevalence between 2% and 3%. The clinical manifestations of cow's milk allergy are very variable in type and severity making it the most difficult food allergy to diagnose. A careful age- and disease-specific history with relevant allergy tests including detection of milk-specific IgE (by skin prick test or serum assay), diagnostic elimination diet, and oral challenge will aid in diagnosis in most cases. Treatment is advice on cow's milk avoidance and suitable substitute milks. Cow's milk allergy often resolves. Reintroduction can be achieved by the graded exposure, either at home or supervised in hospital depending on severity, using a milk ladder. Where cow's milk allergy persists, novel treatment options may include oral tolerance induction, although most authors do not currently recommend it for routine clinical practice. Cow's milk allergy must be distinguished from primary lactose intolerance. This guideline was prepared by the Standards of Care Committee (SOCC) of the British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology (BSACI) and is intended for clinicians in secondary and tertiary care. The recommendations are evidence based, but where evidence is lacking the panel of experts in the committee reached consensus. Grades of recommendation are shown throughout. The document encompasses epidemiology, natural history, clinical presentations, diagnosis, and treatment.

### A comparison of diagnostic tests for lactose malabsorption – which one is the best? [^626d1308]. BMC Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The population based prevalence of lactose malabsorption (LM) in Scandinavia is 2–8%. The prevalence of LM is in the same order in subjects with functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID) as in the general population, whereas perceived milk and lactose intolerance is reported by 30–67% of subjects with FGID. Dietary advice to subjects with FGID and to those with intolerance to milk and lactose relies on a valid and reliable diagnostic test for LM. Such a test is not available.

Lactose is an unabsorbable disaccharide hydrolysed by lactase (lactase-phlorizin hydrolase) in the intestinal brush border into galactose and glucose that are absorbed. LM is a failure to hydrolyse lactose. In adults the most common cause is a genetic defect with lack of intestinal lactase. The unabsorbed lactose is metabolised by colonic bacteria to produce gas (hydrogen (H2) and methane (CH4)) and short chain fatty acids. Clinical manifestations of LM are abdominal pain/discomfort, borborygmi, bloating, flatulence and diarrhoea. In subjects with LM, symptoms depend on the amount of lactose. Most people with LM can, due to colonic adaptation to regular lactose ingestion, ingest up to 6–12 g lactose (120–240 mL milk) without developing symptoms.

Commonly used tests for the diagnosis of LM are based on an exaggerated increase in H2 and/or CH4 in the expired air after intake of lactose, or an inappropriate increase in serum glucose (s-glucose). Other tests are assessment of lactase activity in jejunal biopsies, a test for genetic defects, and registration of symptoms after intake of lactose. Recently, the Rome Consensus Conference published a review of the methodology and indications of H2-breath testing in gastrointestinal diseases. No "gold standard" is available for the diagnosis of LM and breath tests with measurement of volatile compounds and other gases (mainly CH4) were encouraged. There are few comparisons between the tests and no agreement upon which one is the best.

The aims of this study were to assess the agreement between commonly used diagnostic methods for LM (breath test, s-glucose and symptoms), describe the diagnostic properties of the methods and establish the best method and cut-off levels for clinical use.

### Update on lactose malabsorption and intolerance: pathogenesis, diagnosis and clinical management [^21999f7e]. Gut (2019). Medium credibility.

In many clinical studies, only a minority of patients with LI on HBT report satisfactory improvement in symptoms after treatment to reduce intake of dairy products or supplement lactase. Moreover, it remains unclear, to what extent the therapy itself and conditioning of patient expectations contribute to outcome. Lack of improvement can also be due to the presence of functional bowel disorders, which are present in many patients referred for investigation. These patients are sensitive to various nutrients, mechanical and chemical stimuli and, therefore, rarely respond to restriction of dairy products alone.

IBS patients develop symptoms after ingestion of a range of poorly absorbed, fermentable carbohydrates (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides and monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAPs)) that includes but is not restricted to lactose even in LM patients. A low-FODMAP diet improves abdominal symptoms in 50%–80% of IBS patients. This dietary therapy requires commitment from the patient and is best delivered by professional dietician. Identification of factors predicting dietary outcome would improve compliance and cost-effectiveness of this intervention; however, in a large clinical study neither clinical presentation nor HBT results (high dose lactose 50 g or fructose 35 g) predicted response to the low-FODMAP diet. The response to an intermediate dose of a representative, non-absorbable FODMAP (eg, lactulose 20 g) that rarely c symptoms in health, but often induces bloating, abdominal pain and diarrhea in FGID patients may improve the ability of HBT to identify individuals that respond to this dietary intervention. Alternatively, bioassays to identify saccharolytic bacteria and/or fermentation capacity in faecal samples might be developed that predict outcome of lactose (or FODMAP) restriction in patients.

### A comparison of diagnostic tests for lactose malabsorption – which one is the best? [^a2f32aa7]. BMC Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Discussion

This study clearly demonstrates the unsatisfactory agreement between commonly used diagnostic tests for LM. The major methodological problem is the lack of a "gold standard" for the diagnosis of LM. Jejunal biopsies for assessment of lactase activity is an unreliable method due to the irregular dissemination of lactase in the intestine, the available genetic test does not detect all genetic disorders related to LM and does not diagnose secondary LM, breaths tests are highly dependent on the microflora throughout the gut, and serum glucose depends on the glucose absorption and metabolism. Therefore this study assesses primarily the agreement between the test variables. But because assessment of agreement between tests requires a positive or negative result of the test, we had to diagnose LM in each patient. The final diagnosis of LM was based on an overall evaluation of all tests performed in each subject. This is the only applicable method when no formal "gold standard" is available. When the diagnosis was established, the best cut-off levels (normal values) for each of the continuous variables were chosen. A high sensitivity was preferred to avoid false negative results at the expense of a lower specificity.

Therapeutic options

Therapy of lactose intolerance aims to improve patient symptoms and to avoid risk for undernutrition or malnutrition in the long term (figure 8). A diet low in lactose is typically recommended and this is supported by common sense and clinical evidence. However, in contrast to the management of sprue or food allergies, a strict lactose-free diet is not required since patients with LI often tolerate up to 250 mL milk (12 g lactose) without symptoms and more when consumed with food.

Figure 8
Management of lactose malabsorption and lactose intolerance. FODMAPs, fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides and monosaccharides and polyols.

Improved lactose tolerance by manipulating the colonic microbiota could also be achieved by ingestion of prebiotics. A randomised placebo-controlled study in 85 LI patients reported that regular ingestion of short-chain galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS, RP-G28) tended to reduce H 2 production and improve abdominal pain during lactose HBT. After 1 month, 30% of GOS-treated patients versus 6% of placebo-treated patients considered themselves lactose tolerant. Microbiological workup revealed a transient increase in lactose fermenting Bifidobacterium spp. on GOS treatment and a negative correlation between Bifidobacterium levels and abdominal pain, and re-introduction of milk prompted a further shift in bacterial composition, including an increase in the genus Roseburia.

Lactose-free dairy products in which lactase is added to milk are widely available and considered safe, although allergic reactions have been reported. Lactase treatment of milk products also reduces crystallisation of lactose, increasing sweetness and fermentation for production of yoghurt. However, residual side proteolytic activity of lactase can degenerate casein and impair taste, especially after long storage.

Lactase supplementation by tablets improves both lactose digestion (reduced H 2 production) and symptomsalthough the effects are modest (eg, 18% with overall reduction of symptoms). An alternative approach is to ingest probiotics such as Lactobacillus spp. Bifidobacterium longum or Bifidobacterium animalis that produce lactase in the gut. A recent systematic review of this treatment option confirmed an overall positive effect; however, the effect size was not consistently better than lactase supplementation and study quality was poor.

Tests for lactase enzymatic activities on intestinal biopsies will detect primary and secondary LM. While an endoscopy with sedation is not indicated for this purpose, this test can be performed if endoscopy is indicated for other reasons. It should be noted that lactase activity is patchy and more than a single biopsy may be required for optimal test accuracy.

The lactose HBT measures the excretion of hydrogen in expiratory air after an oral challenge with a standard dose of lactose. As hydrogen is not produced by mammalian enzymes, its presence indicates contact of the sugar with bacteria indicating LM, although small intestinal bacterial overgrowth cannot be excluded. In clinical practice, an intermediate lactose dosage of 20–25 g may be optimal. Smaller amounts of lactose lack sensitivity for LM. Larger amounts used in epidemiological studies (eg, 40–50 g, figure 6) induce symptoms even in healthy individuals with LM that tolerate the amount of lactose present in normal diets (see below). A baseline H 2 value < 20 ppm is a requirement for a reliable test and an increase ≥ 20 ppm within 3 hours is diagnostic of LM. Reducing observation time impairs sensitivity; however, only four measurements (0, 90, 120, 180 min) are required for valid results. An H 2 -non-producing microbiota can lead to false-negative HBT. In some of these individuals, methanogenic bacteria (eg, Methanobrevibacter smithii) convert hydrogen to methane (CH 4) in a 4:1 ratio resulting in lower H 2 excretion and a lower fraction of positive tests. Simultaneous assessment of methane can partially overcome this limitation. Therefore, even though the increase in CH 4 is often low (< 20 ppm) and not correlated to symptoms, combined H 2 /CH 4 -measurements are recommended by some authors. A more reliable approach involves the use of 13 C-lactose with simultaneous breath measurements of 13 CO 2 as a marker of lactose digestion and H 2 as a marker of LM (figure 7); however, this technique is not available outside specialist centers.

### A comparison of diagnostic tests for lactose malabsorption – which one is the best? [^f64f3377]. BMC Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Conclusion

This trial shows unsatisfactory agreement between commonly used diagnostic tests for LM. The test with the best diagnostic properties was lactose breath test with 25 g lactose and measurement of the increase in the sum of H2 and CH4x2. The area under the ROC-curve was 0.976, sensitivity was 100% with a cut-off level < 18 ppm, and specificity was 100% with a cut-off level < 53 ppm. Results in the range from 18 ppm to 52 ppm render further tests necessary to obtain a conclusive diagnosis.

FODMAP, fermentable oligosaccharide, disaccharide and monosaccharide and polyols.

These observations are similar to those in post-infective IBSand provide insight into the pathophysiological basis not only of food intolerance but, more generally, functional GI symptoms. IBS is a heterogenous condition; however, symptoms related to intake of food items with poorly absorbed, fermentable carbohydrates such as lactose are reported by up to 70% of patients with this diagnosis. Patients with LI and IBS complain of similar symptoms, have high rates of psychological comorbidity and markers of an activated innate mucosal immune system. Moreover, both respond to similar dietary interventions (see below). Together, this evidence suggests a common pathological basis in which a susceptible individual with a sensitive ('irritable') bowel develops symptoms when exposed even to a modest stimulus, such as low–moderate doses of lactose (figure 3).

Lactase deficiency and lactose malabsorption

The terms relating to lactose metabolism are often mixed-up which may cause confusion (table 2). Lactase deficiency (LD) is the failure to express lactase at the brush border of the small intestine. Lactose malabsorption (LM) refers to any cause of failure to digest and/or absorb lactose in the small intestine. Lactose intolerance (LI) is the occurrence of symptoms such as abdominal pain, bloating or diarrhoea in LM patients after ingestion of lactose.

Table 2
Glossary with definitions related to lactase deficiency, lactose malabsorption and lactose intolerance

Congenital lactase deficiency is a very rare paediatric condition that causes severe symptoms and failure to thrive in infants. The most common cause of LM in adolescents and adults is primary (genetic) lactase non-persistence (LNP). The activity of lactase in the small intestine reaches a peak at the time of birth but is reduced in most populations during childhood, a process which is thought to facilitate weaning. However, in some individuals, high activity of lactase persists, enabling consumption of large amounts of lactose also in adulthood. It should be emphasised that, worldwide, most individuals have LNP with phenotypic LD and LM (figure 2). Thus, LNP, LD and LM are not diseases but normal variants of human metabolism. Other causes of LM include secondary (acquired) LD, rapid small intestinal transit and small bowel bacterial overgrowth.

In case of LM (primary or secondary), undigested lactose comes into contact with the intestinal microbiota. Bacterial fermentation of lactose results in production of gasses including hydrogen (H 2), carbon dioxide (CO 2), methane (CH 4) and short chain fatty acids (SCFA) that have effects on GI function (figure 1).

### A comparison of diagnostic tests for lactose malabsorption – which one is the best? [^7c6cd101]. BMC Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Perceived milk intolerance is a common complaint, and tests for lactose malabsorption (LM) are unreliable. This study assesses the agreement between diagnostic tests for LM and describes the diagnostic properties of the tests.

Methods

Patients above 18 years of age with suspected LM were included. After oral intake of 25 g lactose, a combined test with measurement of serum glucose (s-glucose) and hydrogen (H2) and methane (CH4) in expired air was performed and symptoms were recorded. In patients with discrepancies between the results, the combined test was repeated and a gene test for lactose non-persistence was added. The diagnosis of LM was based on an evaluation of all tests. The following tests were compared: Increase in H2, CH4, H2+CH4 and H2+CH4x2 in expired air, increase in s-glucose, and symptoms. The agreement was calculated and the diagnostic properties described.

Results

Sixty patients were included, seven (12%) had LM. The agreement (kappa-values) between the methods varied from 0.25 to 0.91. The best test was the lactose breath test with measurement of the increase in H2 + CH4x2 in expired air. With a cut-off level < 18 ppm, the area under the ROC-curve was 0.967 and sensitivity was 100%. This shows that measurement of CH4 in addition to H2 improves the diagnostic properties of the breath test.

Conclusion

The agreement between commonly used methods for the diagnosis of LM was unsatisfactory. A lactose breath test with measurement of H2 + CH4x2 in expired air had the best diagnostic properties.

JAMA. 2019; 322: 1600–1601. doi: 10.1001/jama.2019.14740 Lactose intolerance refers to the clinical syndrome in which symptoms of bloating, flatulence, abdominal discomfort, and diarrhea arise following the consumption of lactose-containing foods. Lactose malabsorption results from congenital lactase deficiency, secondary lactose intolerance, and, most commonly, from acquired primary lactase deficiency, a highly prevalent condition affecting 65% to 74% of the worldwide population, with wide regional and ethnic variations. 1, 2 Symptoms arising from lactose malabsorption result from fluid shifts into the intestinal lumen driven by an osmotic gradient and subsequent fermentation of lactose by bacteria residing in the gastrointestinal tract. In this article we review the development of clinical lactose intolerance, diagnostic testing, and treatment of individuals presenting with symptoms of lactose intolerance.

Figure 6
Symptoms in individuals with lactose malabsorption depend on lactose dose and visceral hypersensitivity. A population of Chinese individuals (100% primary lactase non-persistence) including HV with no history of abdominal symptoms and individuals with IBS-D was tested three times with different lactose dosages (10, 20 and 40 g) in a blinded fashion. The likelihood of a clinically positive HBT was higher in individuals with IBS-D for the low and the intermediate lactose dose. HBT, hydrogen breath test; HV, healthy volunteers; IBS-D, diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome. (Source: Adapted from Yang et al.)

Figure 7
Results of a hydrogen breath test of an individual with lactose intolerance with simultaneous assessment symptoms and H 2 levels, indicating lactose fermentation by the microbiota. An H 2 increase by ≥ 20 ppm over baseline indicates lactose malabsorption. When 13 C-labelled lactose is administered, 13 CO 2 levels indicate absorption and metabolisation of 13 C-labelled lactose by the subject. Patient reports of abdominal symptoms subsequent to increases in these markers is diagnostic of lactose intolerance.

The lactose tolerance test measures glucose in plasma at different times (e.g. 0, 30, 60, 120 min) after ingestion of 50 g lactose. Although the test does not require complex or expensive equipment, its invasive nature (multiple blood samples) limits its utility. Use of capillary blood measurements with portable glucose metres makes the test less invasive but does not offer the same diagnostic accuracy as measurements in venous blood.

The gaxilose test involves the administration of the lactase substrate gaxilose (4-galactosylxylose) with measurement of D-xylose in urine or blood. Conceptually, gaxilose measurements are ideal for assessment of intestinal lactase since activity over the entire small intestine is measured. In a manufacturer-sponsored trial, the diagnostic accuracy of gaxilose tests (0.93) was higher than HBT (0.85) or lactose tolerance tests (0.79) in comparison to duodenal biopsies. However, this was not confirmed in an independent study when the genetic test (LCT-13'910:C/T) was used as reference.

Lactose intolerance

Lactose malabsorption (LM) is a necessary precondition for lactose intolerance (LI). However, the two must not be confused and the causes of symptoms must be considered separately. Many individuals with LM have no symptoms after ingestion of a standard serving of dairy products (table 1) whereas others develop symptoms ('intolerance') such as abdominal pain, borborygmi (rumbling tummy) and bloating after lactose intake (figure 1). The onset of these symptoms is strongly correlated to the appearance of hydrogen gas during breath tests. Further, undigested lactose in the small intestine lead to osmotic trapping of water and the osmotic load in the colon is increased about eightfold by fermentation of lactose to SCFA. Diarrhoea will result if the respective load of lactose exceeds the capacity of the colonic microbiota for fermentation or the SCFA load exceeds the colon capacity for resorption.

The likelihood of developing symptoms after lactose ingestion is multifactorial (figure 3). Extrinsic factors include the amount of lactose ingested and whether dairy products are ingested with other foods that affect intestinal transit and the rate of lactose delivery to the colon. Intrinsic factors include expression of lactase at the brush border of the small intestine, history of GI disorders or abdominal surgery and the composition of the intestinal microbiome. When incubated in vitro with lactose, faecal samples from lactose-intolerant subjects mediated faster and higher production of SCFA than samples from lactose-tolerant subjects. However, an impact of SCFA on symptoms has not been directly demonstrated in humans. Further, in the anaerobic environment of the intestinal tract, generation of reducing equivalents result in rapid hydrogen production, and in several clinical studies, the amount of gas production correlated with the presence and severity of intestinal symptoms. Other patient factors not directly related to lactose digestion are also associated with LI. These include the presence of anxiety disorders, high levels of psychosocial stress and the presence of functional GI disorders such as IBS (figures 3 and 4).

### Can we shorten the lactose tolerance test? [^e1a2ed1f]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Lactose malabsorption (LM) is a very common problem with high prevalence in Southern Europe. The lactose tolerance test (LTT) is a basic probe, which is widespread in local hospitals, because it requires non-complex and inexpensive infrastructure. The aims of our study are to determine that a reduction in the duration of LTT does not affect its diagnostic accuracy to detect LM and to calculate the savings that this reduction may represent.

Methods

A prospective study of consecutive patients who underwent LTT for suspected LM was conducted. We analyzed and compared the clinical results and costs (extraction, analytical measurement, time spent by nursing staff, technicians and patients) of suppressing LTT points at 30 and 120 min.

Results

The study included 201 patients. Pathological LTT was found in 119 cases. Eliminating the measurement of glucose at 120 min did not alter the LTT interpretation in any patient; however, up to 18.4% of patients had a LTT misinterpretation when the 30 min point was suppressed. If the LTT 120 min measurement would have been suppressed, 41,334 euros could have been saved.

Conclusions

Suppressing the 120 min LTT point does not imply any changes in clinical results and reduces patient's waiting time; it also benefits the health system by saving time, manpower and materials.

Figure 3
Schematic model of the pathogenesis of lactose intolerance symptoms. In a given population, a fraction of individuals will have digestive dysfunction resulting in lactose malabsorption. Within this population, individuals with anxiety disorders or GI disease that increase visceral sensitivity are more susceptible to the lactose challenge. In this model, the risk of developing symptoms increases with lactose dose, severity of digestive dysfunction (lactose malabsorption) and visceral sensitivity. This model of disease is not restricted to lactose but is likely to be shared by other FODMAPs, fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides and monosaccharides and polyols.

Figure 4
Mechanistic model of lactose digestion in patients with lactase persistence and lactase deficiency illustrating the relationship between lactose malabsorption, visceral sensitivity and symptoms.

Products of lactose fermentation may also trigger extra-intestinal symptoms. A recent review of results from > 2000 patients with a clinical diagnosis of functional GI disorders, reported a high frequency of neurological symptoms such as tiredness and headache after lactose or fructose ingestion. However, it is uncertain whether the occurrence of neurological symptoms was caused by LM, because these patients have a high prevalence of nonspecific somatic complaints, there was no placebo control, no statistical relationship between H 2 production and symptoms was present and no mechanistic explanation was provided.

### Evaluation of breath, plasma, and urinary markers of lactose malabsorption to diagnose lactase non-persistence following lactose or milk ingestion [^34e3f8fb]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Lactose, the predominant disaccharide in milk, is readily hydrolysed by the small intestinal enzyme lactase, liberating the constituent glucose and galactose. However, in the majority of the non-northern European population, the expression of this enzyme is suppressed in early childhood, resulting in lactase non-persistence (LNP). With lactose ingestion, LNP results in lactose malabsorption (LM), and in some individuals, this undigested lactose contributes to the adverse digestive symptoms causing lactose intolerance (LI).

LI can be avoided through exclusion of dietary lactose; however, intolerance to other foods, such as short chain carbohydrates and polyols (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols, or FODMAPs) or proteins like gluten or casein, can also result in similar digestive symptoms such as bloating, flatulence, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, rumbling, and distension. Therefore, confirmation of LM is required to limit unnecessary avoidance of dairy foods, given their importance for a balanced diet and the potential for micronutrient deficiency with dairy avoidance. Different methods are currently used to diagnose LNP, of which measuring lactase activity in an intestinal biopsy is the proposed "gold standard". However, this is an invasive technique for a relatively minor condition. Other more readily measurable, cost-effective and less invasive methods are therefore preferred.

The minority of the adult population maintains lactase expression, known as lactase persistence (LP). Defined genetic polymorphisms have been identified which are associated with continued lactase expression. For example, two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) upstream from the LCT locus (C/T 13910 and G/A 22018) of the minichromosomal maintenance complex component 6 (MCM6) gene are highly associated with LP. Homozygotes (TT 13910 and AA 22018) or heterozygotes (CT 13910 and GA 22018) show continued lactase activity (LP) whereas the wild type (CC 13910 and GG 22018) results in a loss of lactase activity (LNP), as demonstrated in primarily Caucasian populations. Genotyping these SNPs enables accurate diagnosis of LNP and is preferable to intestinal biopsy; however, genotyping remains expensive and has limited applicability to populations and ethnicities for whom LNP-associated polymorphisms may vary. Genotyping is also ineffective for secondary LM, sometimes present with gastrectomy or other gastrointestinal diseases including celiac disease and Crohn's disease where the cause is damage to the intestine rather than genetic alteration of lactase expression.

Dietary carbohydrate intolerance and diagnostic approach — In patients with disorders of gut–brain interaction (DGBIs), "fructose intolerance was more common — seen in 60% of patients — and was higher than lactose intolerance (51%), and its prevalence was similar across all major types of DGBIs, except IBS-C". The "simplest and most economically sound way to diagnose any food intolerance is usually a dietary restriction of short duration (2 weeks), with resolution of symptoms as a positive predictor". Breath testing, "which measures hydrogen, methane, and CO2, is a better low-cost option, albeit reserved for patients refractory to dietary restrictions first and suspected lactose, fructose, or sucrose intolerances".

### Lactose intolerance in infants, children, and adolescents [^0b674746]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

The American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Nutrition presents an updated review of lactose intolerance in infants, children, and adolescents. Differences between primary, secondary, congenital, and developmental lactase deficiency that may result in lactose intolerance are discussed. Children with suspected lactose intolerance can be assessed clinically by dietary lactose elimination or by tests including noninvasive hydrogen breath testing or invasive intestinal biopsy determination of lactase (and other disaccharidase) concentrations. Treatment consists of use of lactase-treated dairy products or oral lactase supplementation, limitation of lactose-containing foods, or dairy elimination. The American Academy of Pediatrics supports use of dairy foods as an important source of calcium for bone mineral health and of other nutrients that facilitate growth in children and adolescents. If dairy products are eliminated, other dietary sources of calcium or calcium supplements need to be provided.

Management of carbohydrate malabsorption

For example, lactose or other disaccharide intolerance.

Definition

Intolerance occurs from the inability to digest carbohydrates. Lactose, a component of milk and some other dairy products, is the intolerance most frequently recognised. It is due to lack of the enzyme lactase in the small intestine. Primary hypolactasia affects 70% of the world's population. Lactose or other disaccharide or monosaccharide (eg, fructose) malabsorption may occur de novo during cancer therapies (such as 5-fluorouracil chemotherapy or radiotherapy), due to damage to brush border enzymes and in some patients persists in the long term.

Diagnosis of carbohydrate intolerance

Trial of exclusion of products containing that specific carbohydrate in diet for 1–2 weeks. Patient to keep a record of symptoms before and during the exclusion.
Specific carbohydrate breath test. Maybe falsely positive in the presence of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO).
Small intestine biopsies and assessment for the specific disaccharide or monosaccharide activity.

Treatment

Long-term exclusion of products containing the carbohydrate in diet.
Dietetic assessment to ensure diet remains balanced. With lactose intolerance special attention should be paid to calcium intake. Other bone health risk factors should also be considered and vitamin and mineral supplementation started as appropriate.
Consideration of a low fermentable oligo-di-monosaccharides and polyols diet.
Oral lactases for isolated lactose intolerance.

Methods

Study design

We conducted a double blinded randomized cross over study in healthy young women aged 18–30 years. The primary outcome of the study, reported elsewhere, was to investigate digestive comfort experienced by dairy intolerant individuals following ingestion of lactose and milk with differing bovine β-casein variants. In total, 40 young women were recruited from the community, 30 of whom self-reported digestive symptoms with milk consumption and 10 who were recruited as dairy tolerant controls, reporting no symptoms with milk consumption. The exclusion criteria included individuals with a BMI below 18 or above 28 kg/m 2, use of antibiotics in the preceding 3 months, gastrointestinal disease (coeliac or inflammatory bowel diseases), or milk allergy. All participants provided written informed consent before the enrolment for the study and were compensated for their time. This study was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the New Zealand Health and Disability Ethics Committees (Reference no.16/STH/175). Prospective clinical trial registration was registered at(ACTRN12616001694404). This study adheres to the CONSORT guidelines.

Lactose is the main sugar in milk

Milk production by the mammary gland is a defining feature of mammals and lactose ('milk sugar'; β-galactosyl-1,4 glucose) is the main source of carbohydrate in human milk and that of other mammals, except for sea lions and walruses which produce low volume, viscous and fatty lactose-free milk.

Infants are uniquely adapted to lactose-based nutrition. In a randomised controlled study, infants fed with breast milk or lactose-based formula had higher levels of glucose and other nutrients (eg, amino acids) in the blood compared with infants with lactose-free formula. Lactose also seems to be the only monosaccharide or disaccharide that does not increase the risk of dental caries. In adults, dairy products account for approximately 14% of energy intake in Europe and North America. In recent years, the amount of milk consumed has slightly decreased in these regions. By contrast, in China and many developing countries, milk intake contributes only 4% to energy intake; however, consumption is increasing rapidly.

Cow's milk contains approximately 5 g lactose per 100 mL, equating to 12.5 g lactose in a typical serving size of 250 mL. Lactose is also present in cultured milk products such as yoghurt and cheese (the second-largest fermentation industry after alcohol). Yoghurt contains ≈50% of the lactose of unprocessed milk; whereas, cheese has low lactose content, especially if long-ripened products are consumed. Additionally, lactose powder is also a common additive in typical processed foods, enhancing the texture and flavour of sausages, gravy, margarines, bread, sauces, and many prepared meals (table 1).

### Systematic review: effective management strategies for lactose intolerance [^96a9408e]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Lactose intolerance resulting in gastrointestinal symptoms is a common health concern. Diagnosis and management of this condition remain unclear.

Purpose

To assess the maximum tolerable dose of lactose and interventions for reducing symptoms of lactose intolerance among persons with lactose intolerance and malabsorption.

Data Sources

Multiple electronic databases, including MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library, for trials published in English from 1967 through November 2009.

Study Selection

Randomized, controlled trials of individuals with lactose intolerance or malabsorption.

Data Extraction

Three investigators independently reviewed articles, extracted data, and assessed study quality.

Data Synthesis

36 unique randomized studies (26 on lactase- or lactose-hydrolyzed milk supplements, lactose-reduced milk, or tolerable doses of lactose; 7 on probiotics; 2 on incremental lactose administration for colonic adaptation; and 1 on another agent) met inclusion criteria. Moderate-quality evidence indicated that 12 to 15 g of lactose (approximately 1 cup of milk) is well tolerated by most adults. Evidence was insufficient that lactose-reduced solution or milk with a lactose content of 0 to 2 g, compared with greater than 12 g, is effective in reducing symptoms of lactose intolerance. Evidence for probiotics, colonic adaptation, and other agents was also insufficient.

Limitations

Most studies evaluated persons with lactose malabsorption rather than lactose intolerance. Variation in enrollment criteria, outcome reporting, and the composition and dosing of studied agents precluded pooling of results and limited interpretation.

Conclusion

Most individuals with presumed lactose intolerance or malabsorption can tolerate 12 to 15 g of lactose. Additional studies are needed to determine the effectiveness of lactose intolerance treatment.

### Genetic test for lactase non-persistence and hydrogen breath test: is genotype better than phenotype to diagnose lactose malabsorption? [^799783ce]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Adult-type hypolactasia is a widespread condition throughout the world, causing lactose malabsorption. The lactose breath test is a simple tool for diagnosis but the need for prolonged monitoring of hydrogen excretion has led to a genetic test proposal. The aim of this study was to compare the genetic test with the lactose breath test in order to give some insights into the clinical value of genetic testing.

Methods

Thirty-two consecutive functional patients underwent lactose breath test and lactase genetic polymorphism analysis (C/T 13910 and G/A 22018). Intolerance symptoms after lactose load were also monitored.

Results

All patients with positive lactose breath test showed homozygosis for both polymorphisms. Among the nine patients with a negative breath test result, six showed heterozygosis while three showed homozygosis. Intolerance symptoms were present in 16 homozygotic patients but also in one heterozygotic patient. The k value for the agreement between the genetic test and the lactose breath test was 0.74.

Conclusion

A positive genetic test for lactase non-persistence indicates whether lactase activity decline may represent a clinical problem for the patient, but does not give information on actual patient symptoms. On the contrary, this information is already available by combining the lactose breath test with intolerance symptom evaluation. Lactose absorption phenotype may be not yet evident until young adult age.

### Lactose digestion in humans: intestinal lactase appears to be constitutive whereas the colonic microbiome is adaptable [^998e489c]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2019). Medium credibility.

Researchers and clinicians have employed several methods to assess an individual's ability to absorb dietary lactose. Clinically, these methods are important because they can be used to exclude lactose intolerance when diagnosing functional GI disorders. Intestinal lactase activity can be measured directly from intestinal biopsies or indirectly with a lactose challenge. Although direct measurement is the reference standard, obtaining biopsies is invasive and rarely available, making indirect measurements more practical for routine assessments. The 2 most frequently used indirect measurements of lactase status are the lactose tolerance test (LTT) and the H 2 -breath test. In both tests, a subject is challenged with an oral dose of 20–50 g lactose after which blood glucose concentrations (LTT) or H 2 concentrations in expiratory air are measured for every 30 min for 2–3 h. The LTT is based on intestinal lactase's ability to hydrolyze lactose to galactose and glucose: blood glucose concentrations failing to increase 20 mg/dL above pretest values are indicative of lactase deficiency. In contrast, the H 2 -breath test is based on the activity of colonic microbes: when lactase activity is low, unabsorbed lactose enters the colon where colonic microbes produce H 2 via a fermentation process. If breath H 2 concentration rises 20 ppm above pretest values, it is regarded as a sign of reduced lactase activity. Both the LTT and the H 2 -breath test are susceptible to confounding factors but the major advantage of these tests is that they allow symptom assessment during testing so they can also be used to diagnose lactose intolerance. In addition to these tests, a genetic test for the C/T-13910 polymorphism is available with the CC genotype interpreted as lactase deficiency. Although this polymorphism correlates well with lactase activity, it mainly reflects lactase status in European populations in which lactase persistence mostly depends only on the C/T-13910 variant. Because different allelic variants determine lactase persistence in other ethnicities, genetic testing for the C/T-13910 polymorphism is unsuitable for these populations.

### A practical guide to managing patients with systemic symptoms and breast implants [^5db3b212]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Gastrointestinal Symptoms

Gastrointestinal complaints reported in association with breast implants are usually abdominal pain and changes in bowel movement patterns consistent with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Notably, IBS with episodes of alternating diarrhea and constipation have been reported by patients with breast implants and other systemic symptoms. Evaluation should include a history of the location and duration of abdominal pain as well as a history of disordered bowel habits (ie, constipation, diarrhea, or both) and their temporal association with abdominal pain episodes. Changes in diet or medications that affect gastrointestinal transit should also be assessed. Although the need for laboratory and other diagnostic testing is typically minimal for routine evaluation of IBS-like symptoms, limited testing may be required to accurately distinguish disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease, lactose and fructose intolerance, and celiac disease. Patients presenting with gastrointestinal complaints should be referred to a gastroenterologist for further evaluation and to determine the need for endoscopy and colonoscopy.

### Hydrogen and methane-based breath testing in gastrointestinal disorders: the North American Consensus [^57923464]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Breath tests are also used in the diagnosis of a variety of carbohydrate maldigestion syndromes. The lactose breath test is performed to diagnose lactose maldigestion/intolerance, which may result from lactase deficiency. Lactose, which is exclusively found in dairy products, is a disaccharide composed of galactose and glucose, and the brush border enzyme lactase phlorizin hydrolase is required for its digestion. Lactase deficiency can be primary or secondary (i.e. acquired lactase deficiency due to damage to, or absence, of the brush border). There is no gold standard test to diagnose lactose maldigestion and large scale data are lacking to compare the degree of agreement of the currently available tests. Jejunal biopsies followed by a lactase activity assay is invasive and unreliable due to patchy lactase distribution in the brush border. Genetic testing only detects primary lactase deficiency, and tests of blood glucose levels following lactose ingestion depend on glucose metabolism and are not reliable. One other limitation of the lactose breath test is false negative results in individuals with fixed hydrogen and non-methane production; however, these only constitute 3.4% of breath tests. As mentioned above, false positive results can also occur.

### Diagnosing lactase deficiency in three breaths [^3b4dbfeb]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Lactose hydrogen breath tests (H(2)-BTs) are widely used to diagnose lactase deficiency, the most common cause of lactose intolerance. The main time-consuming part of the test relates to the sampling frequency and number of breath samples.

Aim

Evaluate sensitivities and specificities of two- and three-sample breath tests compared with standard breath sampling every 15 min.

Methods

Lactose H(2)-BT with probes samples every 15 min served as gold standard. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value of two-sample tests (0–60 min, 0–90 min or 0–120 min) and three-sample tests (0-60-90 min, 0-60-120 min or 0-90-120 min) were calculated.

Results

Among 1049 lactose H(2)-BT performed between July 1999 and December 2005, 337 (32%) had a positive result. Two-sample tests had sensitivity and specificity of 52.5 and 100.0% (0–60 min), 81.9 and 99.7% (0–90 min), and 92.6 and 99.2% (0–120 min), respectively. Three-sample tests had sensitivity and specificity of 83.4 and 99.7% (0-60-90 min), 95.0 and 99.2% (0-60-120 min), and 95.0 and 98.9% (0-90-120 min), respectively.

Conclusion

A three-sample breath test (baseline, 60/90 min and 120 min) has excellent sensitivity and specificity for lactase deficiency. Lactose H(2)-BT can be simplified but not shortened to < 2 h.

It is evident that patients who suffered from LI also experienced osteoporosis and depression more frequently compared to non-LI patients. These patients also often suffered from irritable bowel syndrome and other food intolerances, especially fructose malabsorption. As in many previous studies, patients in the present study population who suffered from LI reported abdominal discomfort, bloating, and digestive problems as their most common symptoms. Likewise, other scientific studies confirmed that lactose malabsorption is often accompanied by fructose malabsorption. The study published by Mishkin et al found that both food intolerances were present concomitantly in 60% of cases.

What was most striking was the strongly significant correlation between the two diagnoses of LI and irritable bowel syndrome. Previous studies indicate that patients suffering from the above-mentioned symptoms are often wrongly diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome. Böhmer and Tuynman were able to demonstrate that the symptoms in subjects with irritable bowel syndrome were reduced or completely eliminated in 87% of cases after adopting a lactose-free diet. Similar findings were reported by Newcomer and McGill and Schöfl et al. However, it should be noted that the preceding studies were conducted in the early 90s and that it is only in recent years that LI has gained greater attention among physicians. A study conducted by Farup et al in 2004 showed no relationship between lactose malabsorption and irritable bowel syndrome. The study published in 2005 by Nucera et al provides one possible explanation for the association: the authors discovered that patients with irritable bowel syndrome frequently exhibited bacterial overgrowth in the intestines, which subsequently distorted breath tests used to diagnose lactose, fructose, and sorbitol intolerances in such a way that they often yielded positive results even though the patients did not suffer from any intolerances. A possible correlation could not be clearly established in the present work based on the existing literature. It can be assumed that patients who suffer from LI often continue to consume dairy products despite their condition, leading to permanent irritation of the gastrointestinal tract, which in turn leads to irritable bowel syndrome.

### Significance of hydrogen breath tests in children with suspected carbohydrate malabsorption [^0a21da7f]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Hydrogen breath tests are noninvasive procedures frequently applied in the diagnostic workup of functional gastrointestinal disorders. Here, we review hydrogen breath test results and the occurrence of lactose, fructose and sorbitol malabsorption in pediatric patients; and determine the significance of the findings and the outcome of patients with carbohydrate malabsorption.

Methods

We included 206 children (88 male, 118 female, median age 10.7 years, range 3–18 years) with a total of 449 hydrogen breath tests (lactose, n = 161; fructose, n = 142; sorbitol, n = 146) into a retrospective analysis. Apart from test results, we documented symptoms, the therapeutic consequences of the test, the outcome and the overall satisfaction of the patients and families.

Results

In total, 204 (46%) of all breath tests were positive. Long-term follow-up data could be collected from 118 patients. Of 79 patients (67%) who were put on a diet reduced in lactose, fructose and/or sorbitol, the majority (92%, n = 73) reported the diet to be strict and only 13% (n = 10) had no response to diet. Most families (96%, n = 113) were satisfied by the test and the therapy. There were only 21 tests (5%) with a borderline result because the criteria for a positive result were only partially met.

Conclusions

Hydrogen breath tests can be helpful in the evaluation of children with gastrointestinal symptoms including functional intestinal disorders. If applied for a variety of carbohydrates but only where indicated, around two-third of all children have positive results. The therapeutic consequences are successfully relieving symptoms in the vast majority of patients.

### Using breath tests wisely in a gastroenterology practice: an evidence-based review of indications and pitfalls in interpretation [^1d820794]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

Breath tests are a simple and safe alternative to more invasive investigation strategies for many gastroenterological conditions. Both the hydrogen breath tests and the new 13C stable radioisotope breath tests are nonradioactive and safe in children and pregnancy. The range of diseases that can be identified include Helicobacter pylori infection, lactose and fructose intolerance, bacterial overgrowth, bile salt wastage, pancreatic insufficiency, liver dysfunction, and abnormal small bowel transit. In this review, the physiology supporting these tests and the principles of normal gas dynamics in the gut are briefly reviewed and then related to the test preparation and interpretation in two parts: 1) detection of H. pylori and 2) small bowel, pancreatic, and hepatobiliary disorders. A MEDLINE search reviewing all English language abstracts from 1966 to March, 2001 was performed, with an additional review of abstracts from major national meetings from 1997 to 2001. Using the information from this review, the performance characteristics of the various tests were detailed, and an attempt is made to provide some literature-based guidance regarding their indications and limitations. The interpretation of "flat" breath tests and the selective use of methane collection and colonic alkalinization are discussed. Breath tests are valuable tools that are, in general, underutilized in evaluating dyspepsia and functional bloating and diarrhea, as well as suspected malabsorption, including lactose intolerance.

### Update on lactose malabsorption and intolerance: pathogenesis, diagnosis and clinical management [^a9ab9cfa]. Gut (2019). Medium credibility.

The ability to digest lactose after infancy made milk a source of nutrition (calories, protein) and clean water accessible to adults. This is likely to have been critical in periods of famine. However, why LP increased fitness to such a high degree is unclear since many individuals with LM can consume 250 mL of milk without developing symptoms, and processing of milk to yoghurt, cheese or butter decreases the advantage of LP further. Further, the 'cost' of LNP with generally mild abdominal symptoms seems modest and individuals with LNP may even benefit from milk consumption due to prebiotic activity of lactose on the colonic microbiota. Increased intake of vitamin D from milk could also provide a selective advantage, especially in Northern Europe with a high risk of vitamin D deficiency due to low ultraviolet exposure.

Taken together, impressive selection pressure took place at the lactase genetic locus after the uptake of pastoralist farming, favouring LP in many regions worldwide; however, the specific advantage of milk consumption that increased survival and whether these are present only during times of dietary or health stress or continuously remain unclear.

### Noninvasive diagnosis of hypolactasia with 4-galactosylxylose (gaxilose): a multicentre, open-label, phase IIB-III nonrandomized trial [^f4a3d6bc]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Goals and Background

Hypolactasia affects over half of the world population. Diagnosis remains problematic as currently available tests, such as the hydrogen breath test, have low reliability and lactose intolerance symptoms are unspecific. We evaluated the diagnostic performance and safety of a new noninvasive diagnostic test based on urine or serum measurement of D-xylose after lactase cleavage of orally administered 4-galactosylxylose (gaxilose).

Study

In a multicentre, open-label, nonrandomized, phase IIb-III study, consecutive patients with symptoms suggestive of lactose intolerance sequentially underwent intestinal biopsy for direct measurement of lactase activity (reference standard), hydrogen breath test, and blood glucose test after lactose challenge, 4- and 5-hour urine-based gaxilose test, and blood-based gaxilose test. For the gaxilose tests, 0 to 4 and 4 to 5 hours urine samples were taken after a 0.45 g gaxilose dose, whereas serum samples were taken 90 minutes after a 2.7 g dose for D-xylose determination. Genetic testing of hypolactasia was also assessed.

Results

Of the 222 patients enrolled, 203 completed all diagnostic tests; 108 were hypolactasic according to biopsy. The sensitivities and specificities and positive and negative predictive values of the gaxilose tests were all > 90% versus 69% to 85% for the hydrogen breath test and the blood glucose test. The area under the ROC curve was significantly higher for the gaxilose tests (> 0.9, P ≤ 0.007). These tests also had higher sensitivity than genetic testing for hypolactasia and were well tolerated.

Conclusions

The diagnostic performance of the gaxilose tests is excellent and can substantially improve the diagnosis of hypolactasia.

### Beyond malabsorption: the need for symptom-based assessment in suspected lactose intolerance. lessons from a test-specific symptom assessment [^12f834c7]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Lactose malabsorption is commonly assumed to cause gastrointestinal discomfort, but symptoms often persist despite lactose restriction or enzyme supplementation.

Objective

This study aimed to assess symptoms following lactose ingestion, its relationship with malabsorption, and its association with fructose sensitivity and disorders of the gut-brain interactions (DGBIs).

Design

In 753 consecutive patients with DGBIs, we performed hydrogen breath tests and used the validated adult Carbohydrate Perception Questionnaire (aCPQ) to assess lactose-induced symptoms. Lactose malabsorption (LM+) was defined as a hydrogen increase of > 20ppm. Lactose induced burdensome symptoms (LS+) were defined by a visual analogue scale (VAS) increase of > 20mm. Fructose sensitivity was assessed in 547 patients using the same protocol.

Results

LM+ was observed in 40.9% of patients, while 55.4% reported LS+. Interestingly, 45.3% of symptomatic patients had no lactose malabsorption (LM-) and 26.0% of malabsorbers had no symptoms (LS-). LS+ were significantly more likely to exhibit fructose sensitivity (45.2% vs. 24.2% in LS-, p < 0.001). DGBIs were similarly distributed in LS+ patients with and without malabsorption. Functional dyspepsia and irritable bowel syndrome were significantly more frequent in LS+, irrespective of whether lactose was malabsorbed or not, than in those without lactose-induced symptoms (with or without malabsorption).

Conclusion

Lactose malabsorption alone is an inadequate predictor of the occurrence of symptoms, emphasizing the need for comprehensive symptom assessment beyond breath test results. This has important implications for the selection of appropriate therapies. The association between lactose and fructose sensitivity suggests a role for visceral hypersensitivity and overlapping mechanisms in symptom development.

### Irritable bowel syndrome and other functional gastrointestinal disorders [^11ac3736]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome is one of several highly prevalent functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID) displaying symptoms of gastrointestinal dysmotility and visceral hypersensitivity. Substantial overlap of symptoms and comorbidities occur not only between irritable bowel syndrome and other FGID but also with gastrointestinal disorders that are not related to motility (eg, celiac disease and lactose intolerance) and to somatic conditions (eg, fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome). Pathogenic mechanisms common among FGIDs may include alternations in intestinal and colonic microflora. Evidence is also emerging of an interplay between gut immune cells/activity and alternations in motility, secretion, and sensation. The role of cytokine activity and inflammation is important in this regard. As recommended by Rome III, diagnostic testing should be guided by the patient's age, primary symptom characteristics, and other clinical and laboratory features. The high prevalence of coexisting conditions suggests the need to routinely assess patients for related disorders. Treatment should be based on an individualized evaluation, explanation, and reassurance.

### Lactose breath test and genotyping showed higher concordance than the urine gaxilose test for the diagnosis of lactose malabsorption in adults [^aee14898]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Lactose malabsorption (LM) is a common condition that occurs when undigested lactose reaches the colon, often causing symptoms such as diarrhea, flatulence, and abdominal pain. Diagnosis can be obtained by performing several tests, each with advantages and disadvantages. This study aims to compare three of the five available methods-the genetic, the urine gaxilose, and the lactose breath tests (LBT) - to evaluate their concordance and assess patient preferences.

Methods

This is an observational and prospective study from two Spanish hospitals, including 73 adult patients with digestive symptoms and LM suspicion. Alongside the three evaluated methods, the lactose intolerance quick test was performed on duodenal samples in a subgroup of patients. Interpretation of LM was determined based on test concordance. Patient questionnaires were completed once all the tests had been performed.

Results

There were 71% of female patients, the mean age was 37.6years, and 52% showed LM. The patients with LM more commonly displayed nausea or vomiting (p = 0.039), avoidance of dairy products (p = 0.023), and use of analgesic and/or anti-inflammatory drugs (p = 0.016). Higher concordance among tests was found in patients without LM (83%), compared to 53% in patients with LM, due to false negatives (32%) for the gaxilose test. All tests showed over 90% sensitivity, with LBT displaying the highest (97%). Genetic testing showed the highest specificity (95%) and the gaxilose test the lowest (68%). Among the three tests, 72% of patients preferred the genetic test.

Conclusions

The LBT and genetic tests showed higher concordance than gaxilose for detecting LM.

### A comparison between lactose breath test and quick test on duodenal biopsies for diagnosing lactase deficiency in patients with self-reported lactose intolerance [^5b72c390]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

A lactose breath test (LBT) is usually used to diagnose lactase deficiency, and a lactose quick test (LQT) has been proposed as a new test on duodenal biopsies to detect this disorder.

Goals

We aimed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of LBT and LQT and their ability to predict the clinical response to a lactose-free diet in patients with self-reported lactose intolerance.

Study

Fifty-five patients (age 47 ± 14 y; M/F 15/36) underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and 25g-LBT. Two duodenal biopsies were taken to determine lactase deficiency (normal, mild, or severe) by LQT and to rule out other causes of secondary lactose malabsorption. Patients with a positive LBT and normal LQT also underwent a glucose breath test to exclude small intestinal bacterial overgrowth as a cause of the former result. The severity of gastrointestinal symptoms was measured with a GSS questionnaire, under basal condition and 1 month after a lactose-free diet.

Results

Lactose malabsorption was detected in 31/51 patients with LBT and in 37/51 patients with LQT (P = NS). Celiac disease was found in 2 patients. Two LBT+ patients showed a positive glucose breath test for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. Eight patients had a mild hypolactasia by LQT and a negative LBT, but they had a significant improvement of symptoms after diet. LQT and LBT were concordant in 83% of cases and predicted the response to a lactose-free diet in 98% and 81% of the cases, respectively (P = 0.03).

Conclusions

LQT is as sensitive as LBT in detecting lactase deficiency; however, it seems to be more accurate than LBT in predicting the clinical response to a lactose-free diet.

Lactose malabsorption and the microbiota

The human body harbours approximately 40 trillion bacteria with approximately 99% of the microbiome contained within in the human colon. Fermentation of lactose by saccharolytic ('sugar digesting') bacteria in individuals with LM can cause abdominal symptoms (figures 1 and 4). However, this process also has benefits. SCFA and other products of fermentation are required for colonic health and liberate additional calories from otherwise indigestible carbohydrates. Moreover, the intestinal microbiota adapts to facilitate intake of dairy products. As a result, although lactase expression is not upregulated by lactose ingestion, regular consumption of lactose appears to reduce breath hydrogen excretion and reduced lactose intolerant symptoms. Both in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate increases in Bifidobacteria and/or Lactobacilli that are considered to be healthy components of the microbiome. In a large study of healthy Japanese, the abundance of Bifidobacteria correlated positively with dietary dairy intake. As this population is 90%–100% LNP, this could reflect the effect of regular lactose intake on the microbiota; however, the reverse cannot be excluded.

Box 1
Pathophysiology of lactose malabsorption

Lactose malabsorption is typically caused by lactase downregulation after infancy due to lactase non-persistence which in Caucasians is mediated by the LCT −13'910:C/C genotype.
Lactase non-persistence is the genetic wildtype and not a disease. Both lactase persistence and non-persistence are common phenotypes in healthy humans.
The lactase genetic region is among the genetic regions strongest shaped by human evolution within the last 10 000 years, with lactase persistence providing a selective advantage of up to 4%–5% per generation.
The LCT −13'910 is the region within the human genome with the strongest interaction with the intestinal microbiota. The LCT −13'910:C/C genotype is associated with higher Bifidobacteria levels on lactose consumption (bifidogenic effect).
Genetic and physiological studies suggest higher bone mineral density and larger height in individuals with lactase persistence.

### Country, regional, and global estimates for lactose malabsorption in adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^01819713]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2017). Medium credibility.

Background

Studies have shown wide variation in the prevalence of lactose malabsorption across the world, but no systematic reviews or meta-analyses have recently assessed the prevalence of lactose malabsorption in different geographical areas. We aimed to present an updated systematic review and meta-analysis on the prevalence of lactose malabsorption in adults, by countries and regions, and to assess the variation between different testing methods.

Methods

Studies reporting on prevalence of lactose malabsorption and lactase persistence were identified by searching MEDLINE and Embase from database inception to Nov 2, 2016. We evaluated studies presenting lactose malabsorption or lactase persistence prevalence data in adults and children aged 10 years or older, including cross-sectional and prospective studies, using genotyping, hydrogen breath tests, lactose tolerance tests, and other testing methods. We excluded studies in children younger than 10 years, studies using self-reported data, and studies including inpatients and outpatients at gastroenterological wards. Studies were screened by two authors (CLS and SKF) and data values were extracted by two authors (CLS and SKF) independently. The primary outcome was the prevalence of lactose malabsorption. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42017064802.

Findings

We screened 2665 records, and 306 study populations from 116 full-text articles were included (primary sources); data for 144 additional study populations from 59 articles were obtained from review articles, because full-text primary articles could not be obtained (secondary sources). Of the 450 study populations included, 231 were assessed by genotyping, 83 by hydrogen breath tests, 101 by lactose tolerance tests, and 35 by other methods or methods that were not described sufficiently. The studies included 62910 participants from 89 countries (covering 84% of the world's population). When standardising for country size, the global prevalence estimate of lactose malabsorption was 68% (95% CI 64–72), ranging from 28% (19–37) in western, southern, and northern Europe to 70% (57–83) in the Middle East. When assessing the global prevalence using genotyping data only, the estimate was 74% (69–80), whereas prevalence was 55% (46–65) using lactose tolerance test data, and 57% (46–67) using hydrogen breath test data. Risk of bias was assessed based on ten indicators; 12 of the articles had a score of ten, indicating low risk of bias, 76 had a score of nine, 26 a score of eight, and two articles a score of seven (indicating higher risk of bias). There was substantial heterogeneity between studies within most of the assessed countries.

Interpretation

Lactose malabsorption is widespread in most of the world, with wide variation between different regions and an overall frequency of around two-thirds of the world's population. Acknowledging regional patterns of lactose malabsorption is important to guide management of gastrointestinal symptoms.

### The effect of probiotics on lactose intolerance (PLI) [^47b5ba7d]. ClinicalTrials (2012). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of LI based on patients' symptoms is sometimes problematic, since these symptoms are not specific and may differ from one patient to another. Breath hydrogen test have been advocated as the best diagnostic tool for the assessment of LI. During the test, subjects are sampled for hydrogen levels of breath samples at base line and every 30 minutes after the administration of 50 grams of oral lactose, for a total period of 180 minutes. A breath sample with > 20 ppm above baseline is considered positive for LI. Studies have shown that people with lactose intolerance tolerated the lactose in yogurt better than the same amount of lactose in milk. The assumption was that the presence of lactase producing bacteria in the yogurt, especially Lactobacillus acidophilus, contributed to the digestion and absorption of lactose.

It was also found that the presence of Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus alleviate lactose intolerance through their ability to produce lactase enzyme. Finally, in another study it was found that consumption of milk containing Bifidobacterium longum resulted in significantly less hydrogen production and flatulence as compared to the consumption of control pasteurized milk. Based on the mentioned data, the investigators speculate that the administration of probiotics may assist with the consumption of dairy products containing lactose. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of probiotics on patients with LI. lactose hydrogen breath test will be performed at base line and at each visit. All subjects will be presented for the lactose hydrogen breath test after 8 hours fast. At the initial stage, the subjects will take a base reading at time 0.

Subjects will then receive 50 g of lactose dissolved in a 100 mL of plain water and will perform further breath test samples every 30 minutes for 3 h. All breath samples will be end-expiratory and analyzed immediately by a Portable Breath Hydrogen Monitor. The concentration of breath hydrogen will be measured in parts per million. The measurements will then be plotted graphically and analyzed. The effect of probiotics on LI treatment will be measured by the following criteria: Collaborators and Investigators
- Ambrosia
- SupHerb Ltd. Study Director: Tsachi T Perets, PhD, Rabin Medical Center.

### A comparison of diagnostic tests for lactose malabsorption – which one is the best? [^808d4b18]. BMC Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

S-glucose is an alternative to breath test. The agreement with the breath test was modest and clinically unsatisfactory, but the diagnostic properties (sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and LR) were identical with that of H2 (table 5). The poor agreement and identical diagnostic properties are the result of different diagnostic classification into health and disease of the two methods. Since no gold standard is at hand it is impossible to judge between them, but because of the low specificity of s-glucose and lower area under the ROC-curve we conclude in accordance with other publications that it is inferior to breath test with measurement of H2 or H2 + CH4x2 (tables 3 and 5).

Registration of symptoms after intake of lactose has been used as a simple test for LM. Evaluation of the onset, severity and duration of symptoms for 8 hours has been recommended. This study shows in accordance with previous reports, that symptoms in general are highly unreliable and unfit for clinical use. Symptoms questionnaires and symptom based criteria such as "Early and Long Lasting (ELL)-symptoms" have better diagnostic properties. In this study ELL-symptoms were superior to unspecified symptoms after intake of lactose. These findings are in agreement with the Rome Consensus Conference that symptoms should be evaluated during and for some hours after the test, and that onset and duration are of importance. But even ELL-symptoms showed unacceptable diagnostic properties and poor agreement with any of the other test (table 4 and 5). This fits with the clinical observation that the prevalence of perceived lactose intolerance, which is also related to visceral hypersensitivity, is significantly higher than that of LM, and that subjects with LM can consume a variable but limited amount of lactose without developing symptoms.

Persistent diarrhea — management focuses on treating identified enteropathogens and underlying gastrointestinal (GI) disease: specific treatment of identified enteropathogens is usually indicated and appropriate management of underlying GI disease is warranted; if bacterial infection is suspected or determined by culture-independent testing, stool culture can determine antimicrobial susceptibility; dietary modifications might help patients with malabsorption or lactose intolerance; symptomatic treatment or the use of nonabsorbable antibiotics offers potential benefit if small intestinal bacterial overgrowth accompanies the symptom complex.

### Lactose intolerance but not lactose maldigestion is more frequent in patients with irritable bowel syndrome than in healthy controls: a meta-analysis [^75abe74c]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2019). Medium credibility.

2.5 Outcome measure

The prevalence of LM, subjective and objective LI were the main outcome parameters in our analysis. LM can be diagnosed through different ways, 21 the non‐invasive and inexpensive LBT and LTT being the most common methods. The sensitivity and specificity of these tests depends on the lactose dose, but they are relatively high (78% and 93%). 32 Before (baseline) and after the ingestion of a given amount of lactose, breath and blood samples are collected at different time points for a period of time and end‐alveolar H 2 and blood glucose concentrations are measured. A certain rise of H 2 (or additionally methane) and/or no rise of blood glucose (or additionally galactose) above the baseline levels are considered diagnostic for lactose maldigestion. The amount of ingested lactose and the diagnostic thresholds were different in the studies. Testing of lactase activity in mucosal biopsy samples from duodenum or jejunum is the gold standard method in the diagnosis of LM, but due to the invasiveness, high costs and patchy expression of the enzyme it is performed less frequently, compared to the tests mentioned above. The availability of genetic testing of the genes associated with lactase non‐persistence (C/T₁₃₉₁₀ with CC genotype; G/A₂₂₀₁₈ with GG genotype) is variable, and its costs are relatively high. 21

Participants with LM who had abdominal symptoms during or shortly after lactose test were defined as objectively lactose intolerant. Participants reporting before any tests, that their symptoms can be in connection with ingestion of lactose‐containing products, were defined as subjectively lactose intolerant.

2.6 Statistical analysis

Pooled odds ratios (OR) were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Random effects and fixed model were applied at all of analyses with DerSimonian‐Laird 33 estimation. Statistical heterogeneity was analyzed using the I 2 and the chi‐square test to gain probability‐values; P < 0.1 was defined to indicate significant heterogeneity. 34 Subgroups of test type (LBT, LTT, lactase activity, and genetic test) and lactose dosages (10‐18 g, 20‐25 g, and 40‐50 g) were created in the analysis on the outcomes. Statistical analyses were performed using the Comprehensive Meta‐Analysis Software (CMA, Biostat, NJ, USA). Forest plots were used to present the results of the meta‐analyses. To check for publication bias, the visual inspection of funnel plots and Eggers' tests were performed.

Secondary lactose malabsorption

Secondary LM refers to the development of LM in individuals who are potentially able to digest lactose (ie, LP individuals). Lactase is situated at the tip of intestinal villi and thus vulnerable to intestinal injury, especially since new immature enterocytes are lactase deficient. As a consequence, secondary LM can complicate GI conditions including infectious gastroenteritis, IBD, coeliac disease and systemic sclerosis (SSc).

The incidence of secondary LM, which is often transitory, caused by infectious gastroenteritis is increased and can be clinically relevant, especially in infants for whom milk is the staple food. In a paediatric study (mean age 12 months) with 126 patients with rotavirus infection and 62 controls with rotavirus negative diarrhoea, LM was more frequent in the former group (60% vs 49%, p = 0.002). Similarly, in adult patients with chronic diarrhoea after kidney transplantation, those with norovirus colonisation had a much higher risk for LM than a control group (100% vs 12.5%). A systematic review concluded that exclusion of lactose would reduce the duration of acute diarrhoea in children by up to a day and reduce 'treatment failure' (RR: 0.5, 95% CI: 0.4 to 0.7), variously described in studies as requirement for unscheduled intravenous fluid injection or persistent stool weight > 30 g/ kg after 3 days.

Similar but more persistent results are seen in IBD. In a meta-analysis, the overall OR for LM in patients with IBD was 1.6 (95% CI: 1.0 to 2.6, p = 0.048), being highest in Crohn's disease (CD) affecting the small bowel. In line with this observation, a paediatric study showed reduced lactase expression in CD patients with the risk of LD correlated with villous atrophy. High prevalence of secondary LM has also been reported in other conditions that affect the mucosal integrity or function of the small bowel. Patients with a new diagnosis of coeliac disease often have a positive lactose HBT; however, many recover the ability to digest lactose after 6–12 months on a gluten-free diet. Patients with SSc also have a high prevalence of LM on breath testing, a finding that is associated with more advanced disease. Secondary LD may complicate environmental enteric dysfunction (EED), a condition that affects mainly children in an environment with low resources, poor hygiene and poor nutrition. EED is characterised by intestinal atrophy and dysbiosis associated with enzyme deficiencies, malabsorption and malnutrition.

Lactose intolerance and IBS

The relationship of LI and IBS has been extensively studied in a South Chinese population with near 100% LNP on genetic testing. A double-blinded, randomised, cross-over comparison of lactose tolerance at 10, 20 and 40 g lactose was performed in IBS patients with diarrhoea (IBS-D) and healthy controls. There was a very strong correlation between the appearance of hydrogen gas in the breath and reports of bloating, pain and other symptoms in patients with lactose intolerance. However, the correlation between the amount of hydrogen gas in the breath and the severity of symptoms was much weaker. Consistent with preliminary findings in a European population, a key observation was that the risk of symptoms and the severity of symptoms were greatly increased in IBS patients, especially at the low to moderate doses found in the normal diet. It is well known that many patients with functional GI disorders have psychological comorbidity and are hypersensitive to dietary and physical stimuli that affect the digestive tract. Further work demonstrated that anxiety, visceral hypersensitivity (defined by rectal barostat) and high levels of gas production on breath tests all increased the severity of abdominal symptoms after ingestion of 20 g lactose. Moreover, mucosal biopsies from the ileum and colon showed increased numbers of mast cells and intraepithelial lymphocytes in lactose-sensitive patients and showed that the release of inflammatory cytokines (eg, tumour necrosis factor) after lactose intake was higher in this group than controls.

Box 2
Clinical relevance of lactose intolerance

Lactose intolerance is defined as symptoms on lactose exposure in individuals with lactose malabsorption.
Most individuals with lactose malabsorption tolerate a dose of at least 12 g lactose (corresponding to 250 mL of milk) without problems. Larger doses may be tolerated if consumed with food or spread over a whole day.
Symptoms of lactose intolerance depend on the strength of the stimulus (ie, lactose dose) and the presence of visceral hypersensitivity, as observed in many patients with IBS.
Treatment options for lactose intolerance include a low-lactose diet, oral lactase enzyme replacement, prebiotics that produce bacterial lactase in the colon and, potentially, prebiotics that adapt the colonic microbiota.
Intolerance of low–moderate lactose doses often indicates the presence of IBS. Such individuals are sensitive to a range of poorly absorbed, fermentable foods ('FODMAPs'). Effective dietary treatment in this group requires not a low-lactose but a low-FODMAP diet.

### Do patients with lactose intolerance exhibit more frequent comorbidities than patients without lactose intolerance? An analysis of routine data from German medical practices [^d1b8d5bf]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Although the intolerance of milk and milk products is not a disease unique to modern times, it was only at the beginning of the 19th century that it garnered the attention of the scientific community. In most people, a deficiency of the enzyme lactase-phlorizin hydrolase ("lactase"), which splits the disaccharide lactose contained in milk into galactose and glucose, causes this problem. Lactose ingested with food is only hydrolyzed insufficiently in individuals who suffer from lactose intolerance (LI). The inadequate splitting of lactose in the colon results in short-chain fatty acids, hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and methane. Most sufferers complain of abdominal discomfort, bloating, flatulence, and osmotic diarrhea. However, non-specific symptoms such as headaches, depression, chronic fatigue, concentration problems, and muscle pain may also be related to LI. Tolerance of dairy products varies greatly between patients. Approximately 70% of the global population have lactase non-persistence, whereas in Germany and Austria about 20–25% of the population are affected by this condition.

Therapy involves a low-lactose/lactose-free diet. Numerous studies have been conducted regarding the development, pathophysiology, and treatment of LI, yet only few publications have dealt with the comorbidities resulting from this food intolerance. LI has been associated with osteoporosis, depression, and ovarian cancer. To this end, the present study aimed to explore whether there is a morbidity difference between patients with medically diagnosed LI and patients without LI in general medical practices.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of refractory celiac disease: expert review [^1a15ea58]. Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Refractory celiac disease — initial evaluation algorithm begins with "Celiac disease with persistent or recurrent symptoms or signs" and instructs to "Confirm celiac disease diagnosis with review of initial diagnostic evaluation". If "Celiac disease not present", the pathway is to "Consider other causes of villous atrophy such as medication-induced enteropathy, giardiasis, autoimmune enteropathy, and common variable immunodeficiency". If "Celiac disease present", it advises to "Confirm adherence to gluten-free diet" with "Repeat serologic testing", "Dietitian review", and "Gluten immunogenic peptides"; when there is "Poor adherence", provide "Diet instruction", "Support group", and "Close clinical follow-up". Next perform "EGD with duodenal biopsies" and, "If high suspicion of RCD2, consider biopsies for IHC, T-cell studies, flow cytometry". On the branch "Persistent villous atrophy?", if "No", "Consider other causes of symptoms such as irritable bowel syndrome, pancreatic insufficiency, lactose or fructose intolerance, microscopic colitis, and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth" and "Treat other causes as indicated".

### Lactose intolerance but not lactose maldigestion is more frequent in patients with irritable bowel syndrome than in healthy controls: a meta-analysis [^df63895f]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2019). Medium credibility.

Lactose intolerance (LI) is a condition characterized by clinical symptoms after ingestion of lactose‐containing products, caused by lactose maldigestion (LM). 20 The most common cause of LM is primary (adult‐type) hypolactasia. 3 LI affects 25% of the Caucasian population. Males and females are equally affected. 21, 22 Because of lactase deficiency, lactose can reach the large intestine where it is fermented by colonic bacteria. Short‐chain fatty acids, gases (H 2, CO 2 and CH 4) and other products will be produced by the fermentation which can cause luminal distension and lead to different gastrointestinal symptoms. The most common complaints are abdominal pain and discomfort, bloating, flatulence, and diarrhea, similarly as in IBS. 20, 23, 24, 25 Due to the potential pathogenetic factors of IBS (altered gastrointestinal motility, changes of gut microbiome, visceral hypersensitivity, anxiety, etc), food intolerances, such as LI, are more frequent in this disease, however, the prevalence of LM does not differ compared with the healthy population. More IBS patients have symptoms at lower lactose doses and their symptoms are more severe. Moreover, many IBS patients think that their abdominal symptoms are related to lactose intake, even though no objective tests of LM were carried out. 26, 27, 28, 29, 30 The available diagnostic methods for diagnosing LM or LI are based on several approaches, including lactose breath test (LBT), lactose tolerance test (LTT), genetic test and assessment of lactase activity in jejunal biopsy specimens. 3 The restriction of lactose intake or the replacement of the lactase enzyme can alleviate these symptoms. 3, 21

There are numerous clinical trials investigating the connection between IBS, LM, and LI, but to our best knowledge no meta‐analyses have been performed up to this day.

Given the uncertain connection between IBS and lactose consumption‐related disorders, we performed a systematic literature search and meta‐analysis in this important topic with the aim to assess the prevalence of LM, objective and subjective LI in IBS patients compared to healthy controls (HC).

### Is lactose intolerance implicated in the development of post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome or functional diarrhoea in previously asymptomatic people? [^c58eade5]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

The relationship between lactose intolerance and post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in adults is uncertain. Bowel symptoms may persist after bacterial gastroenteritis and as post-infectious IBS. Acquired lactose intolerance may follow viral enteric infections in children. We compared the frequency of lactose intolerance after bacterial gastroenteritis in adults with and without symptoms of IBS or functional diarrhoea at 3-6-months' follow-up.

Design

A prospective cohort study was conducted.

Methods

All subjects with bacterial gastroenteritis confirmed by stool culture from the microbiology laboratory and without prior IBS or functional diarrhoea were eligible to participate. IBS and functional diarrhoea were diagnosed via self-completed Rome II modular questionnaires. Lactose intolerance was determined from a rise in breath hydrogen and plasma glucose and symptoms.

Results

One hundred and twenty-eight subjects with bacterial gastroenteritis were followed prospectively, from which a smaller cohort of 42 subjects took part in this study. The cohort was comprised of 24/25 subjects who developed post-infectious IBS (n = 16) or functional diarrhoea (n = 8) (9 male, 15 female) and 18 random controls (8 male, 10 female) chosen from the group without IBS or functional diarrhoea. The mean age of the subjects was 44.4 years (range 25–76 years). In the group with functional diarrhoea or IBS, four subjects had failure of the plasma glucose to rise but none had abnormal glucose hydrogen breath tests. In the control subjects, one had a positive combined test and six had failure of plasma glucose to rise alone. No subject developed symptoms during the test.

Conclusions

Bacterial gastroenteritis did not cause persistent lactose intolerance in our study population. Lactose intolerance does not appear to be implicated in the aetiology of post-infectious bowel symptoms, including IBS. Advice to avoid dairy products in patients presenting with post-infectious IBS on the basis that they may have lactose intolerance appears unnecessary in patients from northern England.

### Update on lactose malabsorption and intolerance: pathogenesis, diagnosis and clinical management [^d484534c]. Gut (2019). Medium credibility.

Lactose intolerance and quality of life

Like other functional GI disorders, LI is not a trivial condition but has a negative impact on quality of life and nutrition. Anxiety increases the risk of symptoms ('intolerance') after lactose ingestion, but the fear that food will trigger bloating, pain and diarrhoea is also a cause of anxiety. Indeed, in studies, not only patients with LI but also those with self-diagnosed LI who do not have the condition describe a lower quality of life than individuals without concerns about food intolerance. This anxiety generalises to other foods, and patients with LI often describe intolerance to a range of products, especially those known to cause bloating (eg, legumes and dried fruit). As a result, individuals might adopt a restrictive diet that could impact on health in a variety of ways. In severe cases, this form of behaviour is termed avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder by DSM-5, a form of eating disorder that is associated with weight loss but not with body dysmorphia.

### Assessment of lactase activity in humans by measurement of galactitol and galactonate in serum and urine after milk intake [^ba4cdf0f]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2019). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, hypolactasia is a highly prevalent disorder that is often difficult to diagnose. An accurate assessment of LA in subjects experiencing gastrointestinal discomfort could help to avoid inappropriate food restriction. The evaluation of galactitol and galactonate in urine could be used as a noninvasive test to determine LA. Additional, larger studies are needed to confirm these results in different populations, including populations with different genotypes, age groups (children, adults, elderly), and genders. These studies should also confirm the accuracy of the test in 3-h pooled urine and help to refine the discriminative cutoff. Once validated, this indirect assessment of LA could be highly relevant for clinical assessment of lactose metabolism.

### Agreement between indirect calorimetry and traditional tests of lactose malabsorption [^fdabf833]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Lactose malabsorption occurs frequently and the variable consequent intolerance may seriously impair quality of life. No reliable and convenient test method is in routine clinical practice. A recent animal study showed that the respiratory quotient changed significantly after ingestion of sucrose and lactose in naturally lactase-deficient rats.

Aims

This exploratory study evaluated the relevance of monitoring the respiratory quotient after lactose ingestion to detect malabsorption.

Methods

Healthy volunteers were identified and classified lactose absorbers and malabsorbers by a lactose tolerance test (25 g). After an overnight fast, a second lactose challenge was performed to monitor hydrogen excretion and respiratory quotient kinetics over 4h. Participants also completed questionnaires to score and localise their gastrointestinal symptoms.

Results

20 subjects were enrolled (10 per group, 60% males, mean age 34 ± 4 years). Respiratory quotient kinetics were different between absorbers and malabsorbers during the first 100 min after lactose ingestion (p < 0.01) and during the initial 30–50 min period. Respiratory quotient was significantly, positively correlated to peak glycaemia (R = 0.74) and negatively correlated to hydrogen excretion (R = -0.51) and symptoms score (R = -0.46).

Conclusions

Indirect calorimetry could improve the reliability of lactose malabsorption diagnosis. Studies on larger populations are needed to confirm the validity of this test and propose a simplified measurement.

2.3 Anaphylaxis as outcome measure of severity

To assess severity of AGS episodes, we abstracted all self‐reported and physician‐documented signs and symptoms, which we categorized based on the organ system involved: mucocutaneous (e.g. hives/urticaria, itching, redness of palms or soles, lip swelling, flushing, throat swelling, rash, tongue swelling, congestion, rhinorrhea, itchy throat); respiratory (e.g. shortness of breath, chest tightness, wheezing, respiratory distress or apnea, cough); cardiovascular (e.g. dizziness, syncope, hypotension, weakness or numbness, chest pain, tachycardia or palpitations); and gastrointestinal (e.g. abdominal pain or cramping, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, heartburn, indigestion, difficulty swallowing). Headache and muscle/joint pain or swelling were classified as 'other'. Anaphylaxis was defined as any reaction involving ≥ 2 organ systems. Patient data were reviewed independently by two medical providers to confirm final anaphylactic designation.

2.4 Characterization of patients experiencing‐associated reactions to dairy products

Avoidance of red meat is a mainstay of AGS management; however, for a subset of patients, avoidance of other mammalian derivatives including bovine‐derived milk or dairy products may also be necessary to prevent additional reactions. We therefore identified patients experiencing AGS reactions associated with ingestion of dairy products (dairy product‐reactive patients) and compared their clinical presentation and laboratory characteristics to patients who did not report signs or symptoms of AGS associated with dairy products (dairy product‐tolerant patients). Symptoms with dairy consumption can be due to etiologies other than AGS, including lactose intolerance, cow's milk allergy and lactase deficiency; therefore we report patients as dairy‐reactive only if (i) chart documentation stated that symptom onset was at least 2 h after dairy consumption [guidelines suggest the standard measurement interval to assess malabsorption and intolerance is 30 min],(ii) documentation stated dairy‐related symptoms were new in onset with AGS diagnosis, and (Iii) dairy‐related gastrointestinal symptoms occurred in conjunction with non‐GI signs/symptoms (e.g. urticaria, angioedema, hypotension). Using these criteria, 3 charts were excluded from symptom analysis portion of the results.

### Pathophysiology and management of diabetic gastroenteropathy [^af83e5b3]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Figure 2.
Diagnostic algorithm in persons with suspected diabetic gastroenteropathy.

People with bothersome gastrointestinal symptoms should first undergo laboratory and imaging tests for exclusion of organic disease. If these are not helpful and symptoms are severe, or do not respond to simple therapeutic measures, GI function tests should be performed based on individual symptom pattern. These may reveal manifestations of diabetic gastroenteropathy (e.g. typical small bowel dysmotility in a person with diarrhoea), complications of diabetic gastroenteropathy (e.g. small bowel bacterial overgrowth) or differential diagnoses (e.g. lactose intolerance). BT: breath test; CHO: carbohydrate; EMG: Electromyography; GERD: gastro-oesophageal reflux disease; GI: gastrointestinal; HRM: high resolution manometry; SIBO: small bowel bacterial overgrowth; TG: triglyceride; WMC: wireless motility capsule.

Gastric emptying tests are recommended at an early stage in people with diabetes and dyspeptic symptoms. One reason for this is that gastric emptying is of paramount importance for blood glucose control. Another reason is that approximately 20% of people with diabetes and disturbed gastric emptying have functional dumping syndrome, i.e. accelerated gastric emptying without prior upper GI surgery, in contrast to the more frequently reported complication gastroparesis. Both disturbances cannot be differentiated reliably based on symptoms, but obviously require different treatment strategies. Recommendations regarding optimal use of gastric emptying tests are reviewed in detail elsewhere. Even in the absence of dyspeptic symptoms, gastric emptying testing can play a role in exclusion of diabetic gastropathy as a cause of impaired blood glucose control not responding to antidiabetic medication.

Once settled on the diagnosis diabetic gastroenteropathy, treatment options are not overwhelming, but the cornerstone is tight glycaemic control.

### Evaluation of breath, plasma, and urinary markers of lactose malabsorption to diagnose lactase non-persistence following lactose or milk ingestion [^9ac093e0]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

It is important to note that the change in breath H 2 depends on the dose of the lactose administered. Lactose doses vary within clinical and research practice, ranging from adjustments per kg body weight (particularly for children), to standard doses used to ensure LM (50 g), or to approximate realistic doses (e.g. 10 g to 25 g). However, the cut-off value is not always dose-adjusted to diagnose LM or LNP. Where milk is used as a substrate, the dose of lactose is likely to be lower, as one serving (250 mL) of milk has only 12 g lactose. Our study demonstrated that without a lactose-dose adjustment of the cut-off, the sensitivity of breath H 2 using A2M was reduced to 78.6%, more similar to the sensitivities observed for plasma glucose. With a lactose-dose adjustment of the cut-off, the sensitivity after A2M was improved due to avoidance of one false negative result. However, lactose-dose adjustment did not improve the breath H 2 sensitivity following CON ingestion, and rather decreased specificity to 96.2% due to one false positive. This difference between milks was also evident with the lactose-dose adjustment cut-off for A2M (15 ppm) more closely approximating the calculated cut-off (13 ppm), while for CON some discrepancy remained. Hence, to preserve the sensitivity and specificity of LM detection, even using the highly reliable breath H 2, cut-off values should be used that have been validated for the specific dose and substrate of lactose used.

The breath H 2 cut-off values calculated from this study, especially after a lactose challenge, were much higher than the literature cut-offs. One reason could be that one LP heterozygous individual had much higher breath H 2 than the rest of the group (i.e. outlier); yet, even when this was accounted for, the breath H 2 cut-off still remained higher than the literature cut-offs. The calculated cut-off may also have been high due to the higher lactose dose used, or the presence of high-grade lactose malabsorbers (breath H 2 increase > 70 ppm). The use of literature cut-offs however detected lactose malabsorption with 100% sensitivity, with presence of only 1 FP (which was the heterozygous LP individual). Thus in order to achieve higher sensitivity it is appropriate to use a lower cut off (20 ppm) after lactose challenge.

### Assessment of lactase activity in humans by measurement of galactitol and galactonate in serum and urine after milk intake [^69438724]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2019). Medium credibility.

Different methods are currently used to diagnose LM. Jejunal biopsy, by allowing the direct measurement of LA, is considered the gold standard method, but it is invasive, with patchy results. Conversely, genetic testing of primary lactase persistence is noninvasive but can lead to false results in the case of genetic heterogeneity or where secondary causes of LM are present. The lactose tolerance test (LTT) and the recently developed gaxilose test both allow indirect evaluation of LA through absorption testing, whereas the lactose hydrogen breath test (LHBT) is based on testing the colonic consequences of LM. These methods are widely used but can be unreliable and difficult to interpret in clinical practice. The development of a complementary method that would address some of the major limitations of the available tests could be clinically useful.

We have recently shown that both lactose and galactose are present in blood after the ingestion of milk and yogurt. Once absorbed, the majority of galactose enters the Leloir pathway, where it is metabolized to UDP-glucose. However, it can also enter 2 other hepatic pathways, to be either reduced to galactitol by aldehyde reductase or oxidized to galactonate by galactose dehydrogenase. Both galactitol and galactonate have been identified as candidate biomarkers of lactose-containing food intake in serum and urine. We therefore hypothesized that these 2 metabolites might also be good proxies of LA.

### Breath hydrogen testing in east and southeast Asia [^416b6a02]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Breath hydrogen tests are popular, noninvasive tests for the assessment of carbohydrate fermentation in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and functional dyspepsia (FD). There is limited information regarding the utility of breath hydrogen and methane tests in IBS and FD patients in East and Southeast Asia. This review aims to summarize current literature about common indications of breath testing in this region, the genesis of functional gastrointestinal symptoms by provocative breath testing and provide suggestions for correct use. The most common testing indication is the assessment of lactose intolerance, followed by small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) and differentiation of intestinal gas profiles in research setting. Studies in this region not only documented a high prevalence of lactose malabsorption but a population, both healthy and IBS, that is highly symptomatic to typical lactose intakes. Breath hydrogen assessment of other fermentable carbohydrates (FODMAPs) are fairly uncommon, whereas methane breath testing is almost nonexistent. Cumulative hydrogen production following lactulose was also not excessive in IBS patients compared with controls. The evidence however, for the detection of SIBO suggests limited reliability in the use of lactulose or glucose breath testing alone and inconclusive data on its correlation with symptoms. Conversely, little has been carried out in FD. In conclusion, breath testing should be limited in the predicting patients with SIBO for directing clinical management but can be considered in the objective assessment of lactose malabsorption within a low FODMAP diet. Recommendations to improve the interpretation of breath testing in research were also provided.

### Evaluation of breath, plasma, and urinary markers of lactose malabsorption to diagnose lactase non-persistence following lactose or milk ingestion [^4f03fdc9]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Breath hydrogen was more reliable to diagnose LNP compared to plasma glucose and urinary galactose/creatinine ratio after a lactose challenge. When milk was used as a substrate, breath H 2 was a reliable method to diagnose LNP but plasma glucose and urinary galactose/creatinine ratio were not reliable when using available cut-off values. However, breath H 2 accuracy and optimal cut-off values may depend on the protein content in the milk, as higher A2 β-casein content reduced the diagnostic threshold relative to lower A2 β-casein content or lactose alone. Therefore, the diagnostic threshold of even highly reliable malabsorption tests like breath H 2 may vary depending on the substrate used.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of refractory celiac disease: expert review [^28f39968]. Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Update — best practice advice 1–4 for patients with suspected nonresponsive celiac disease details diagnostic verification and evaluation steps: In patients believed to have celiac disease who have persistent or recurrent symptoms or signs, "the initial diagnosis of celiac disease should be confirmed by review of prior diagnostic testing, including serologies, endoscopies, and histologic findings". In patients with confirmed celiac disease with persistent or recurrent symptoms or signs, ongoing gluten ingestion "should be excluded" using "serologic testing, dietitian review, and detection of immunogenic peptides in stool or urine", and "esophagogastroduodenoscopy with small bowel biopsies should be performed" to assess for villous atrophy; if villous atrophy persists or the initial diagnosis was not confirmed, clinicians should "consider other causes of villous atrophy, including common variable immunodeficiency, autoimmune enteropathy, tropical sprue, and medication-induced enteropathy". For patients with nonresponsive celiac disease, after exclusion of gluten ingestion, clinicians should "perform a systematic evaluation" for other causes including "functional bowel disorders, microscopic colitis, pancreatic insufficiency, inflammatory bowel disease, lactose or fructose intolerance, and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth". For subtyping and lymphoma exclusion, clinicians should "use flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, and T-cell receptor rearrangement studies" and recognize that "Type 1 refractory celiac disease is characterized by a normal intraepithelial lymphocyte population and type 2 is defined by the presence of an aberrant, clonal intraepithelial lymphocyte population"; "consultation with an expert hematopathologist is necessary to interpret these studies".

### Cow's milk allergy versus cow milk intolerance [^83a19e6a]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Although cow's milk allergy (CMA) and cow's milk intolerance (CMI) are two different terms, they are often used interchangeably, resulting in confusion both in clinical practice and in research reports.

Objective

To promote the appropriate differential use of the terms CMA and CMI.

Methods

Highlighting the differences in clinical and laboratory findings between CMA and CMI. Information was derived from reviewing the literature on these two topics, supplemented by the clinical experience of the author.

Results

CMA is an immunologically mediated reaction to cow's milk proteins that may involve the gastro-intestinal tract, skin, respiratory tract, or multiple systems, ie, systemic anaphylaxis. Its prevalence in the general population is probably 1 to 3%, being highest in infants and lowest in adults. Even though it can cause severe morbidity and even fatality, dietary elimination is associated with good prognosis. However, CMI should refer to nonimmunologic reactions to cow's milk (CM), such as disorders of digestion, absorption, or metabolism of certain CM components. The most common cause of CMI is lactase deficiency, which is mostly acquired during late childhood or adulthood. It has high racial predilection, being highest in dark-skinned populations and lowest in northern Europeans. Lactose intolerance is generally a benign condition, with symptoms limited to the gastro-intestinal tract, yet the primary acquired type lasts for a lifetime. Symptoms can be well ameliorated by reducing the intake of CM or using lactose-hydrolyzing agents.

Conclusions

Adverse reactions to CM should be differentiated into immunologic (CMA) and nonimmunologic (CMI). The latter is still a general term that comprises several conditions and requires further differentiation.

### Diagnosis of lactose intolerance and the "nocebo" effect: the role of negative expectations [^d1f90149]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Diagnosis of lactose intolerance is based on a "positive" H(2) breath test associated with abdominal symptoms. The present study established to what extent the occurrence of symptoms during a "negative" H(2) breath test may result from a "nocebo effect" instead of lack of sensitivity of the procedure.

Methods

Between 2005 and 2007, 636 outpatients performed a standard 4-h 25g lactose tolerance test. The test was positive in 254, negative in 325, and 57 patients were H(2) "non-producers". Twenty-seven patients reporting symptoms despite a negative H(2) breath test underwent a "sham" breath test following ingestion of 1g of glucose. Fifty-four patients presenting with documented lactose intolerance were used as controls.

Results

Twelve out of 27 patients (44.4%), and unexpectedly also 14 (25.9%) controls presented abdominal symptoms during the sham test. The difference between the two groups was not significant (P < 0.15) OR 2.28; C. I. 0.77–6.78.

Conclusion

In most instances, symptoms reported by patients during a negative lactose H(2)BT cannot be attributed to a false-negative test. Instead, a non-organic component, resulting from negative expectations ("nocebo effect") is likely implicated. Moreover, also in patients diagnosed as lactose intolerant, the need for restricting the primary source of dietary calcium should be critically reconsidered.

### Concordance between lactose quick test, hydrogen-methane breath test and genotyping for the diagnosis of lactose malabsorption in children [^f098a536]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Lactose intolerance is a frequent condition in certain populations. Different methods for diagnosis exist. There is scarce literature regarding Lactose Quick Test (LQT) and concordance with other methods for lactose intolerance diagnosis in children.

Methods

Prospectively, we included children who underwent gastroduodenoscopy for evaluation of abdominal pain. We obtained a duodenal sample for LQT and blood sample for genetic test to evaluate LCT C > T -13910 variant. Later, patients underwent breath test with lactose, to evaluate malabsorption. We evaluated the concordance between the three different tests.

Key Results

We included 46 patients, 56.5% women. Mean age was 13.2 years (range 9–18 years). 66.6% of patients had lactose malabsorption according to breath test; 64.4% were homozygous CC; and 91.3% had hypolactasia (mild or severe) according to LQT. None of the patients with normolactasia had altered breath test. Genetic test had a substantial agreement (k = 0.675) with breath test and fair agreement (k = 0.301) with LQT. LQT had fair agreement (k = 0.348) with breath test.

Conclusions & Inferences

Genetic test had better concordance with breath test than LQT to diagnose lactose malabsorption, however, none of the patients with normal LQT had lactose malabsorption. In patients who undergo gastroduodenoscopy to study abdominal pain, it seems reasonable to perform LQT, and, in those with hypolactasia, to perform breath test.

### Evaluation of breath, plasma, and urinary markers of lactose malabsorption to diagnose lactase non-persistence following lactose or milk ingestion [^9337e6cb]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Validity of literature cut-offs

To compare with literature, an increase over baseline in breath H 2 ≥ 20 ppm blood glucose ≤ 1.11 mmol/L and postprandial galactose/creatinine ratio at ≤ 0.10 mg/mg were taken as the cut-off values to diagnose LM (Table 1), and were then compared against the genotype results. For the standardised lactose challenge, classification of LNP and LP using malabsorption markers (breath H 2, plasma glucose, and urinary galactose/creatinine ratio) was determined based on diagnostic cut-offs previously reported in literature (Table 1). Following milk consumption, cut-offs for breath H 2, plasma glucose and urinary galactose/creatinine ratio were additionally adjusted for the dose of lactose consumed; this approach has previously been used in literature when using milk as a substrate. Similarly, as breath H 2 has often been assumed to increase linearly with the dose of lactose consumed, the literature cut-off after milk was also adjusted for lactose dose: 15 ppm from 20 ppm, based on 37.5 g lactose in 750 mL of milk. The validity of the breath H 2 was assessed with and without the adjusted value.

Table 1
Diagnostic cut-off for lactose malabsorption based on literature

Cut-off values are based on validated methods for maximal increase in breath H 2 and plasma glucose over baseline and urinary galactose/creatinine ratio at 180 min, following ingestion of 50 g of lactose

The agreement between the genotype classification and literature-based malabsorption marker classification was determined using Cohen's kappa coefficient.

3.1 Search results

Using the terms mentioned above, we found 647 articles in the three databases for evaluation, 213 in PubMed, 413 in Embase and 21 in Cochrane Library. We also examined 14 further articles from the reference lists of relevant articles, so 661 articles were found in total. After using the language (only English) and species (only humans) filters in Embase, PubMed and the Cochrane Library, 520 of 647 studies were further assessed and none of the articles from the reference lists were excluded. After removing duplicates, title and abstract screening, 89 articles reporting on lactose consumption‐related disorders in IBS and eligible for further evaluation were found. The detailed screening of the full‐text papers identified 16 articles for further assessment, of which two were not suitable for statistical analysis. Altogether 14 case‐control studies met the inclusion criteria and remained for quantitative analysis. 26, 27, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46 The flow chart of the systematic literature search was based on the PRISMA 2009 guideline and is detailed on Figure 1. At the time of the literature search, we found no eligible paper that used the most recent diagnostic criteria (Rome IV) for IBS. The basic characteristics of the articles and the raw data are summarized in Tables 1 and S2. The proportion of each IBS subtype and the used lactose doses, diagnostic methods for LM and thresholds in the studies included in the meta‐analysis are detailed in Table 2. A quality assessment (NOS) of the articles is summarized in Tables 3 and S3.

### Assessment of lactose tests… [^4159bf56]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

to the editor: In the article, "Lactose Intolerance, " 1 Dr. Swagerty and colleagues acknowledge that the lactose tolerance test has false-positive or false-negative results in 20 percent of patients. They also state that the lactose breath hydrogen test has been found positive in 90 percent of patients with lactose malabsorption. We compared three different methods of diagnosing lactose malabsorption: lactose load with determination of blood glucose concentration; lactose load with urinary galactose measurement; and duodenal lactase activity assay. Our studies show a higher false-negative rate when using blood glucose measurements, causing lactose malabsorption to remain undiagnosed in many patients. The sensitivity and specificity in our studies was only 60 percent and 96 percent, respectively. The specificity is comparable with the use of breath hydrogen or urinary galactose measurement tests.

2, 3 Therefore, the lactose test with blood glucose measurement should not be used as a screening test when high sensitivity is important. When assessing the effectiveness of these tests in the clinical practice setting, one must consider predictive values as well as false-positive and false-negative results. Although the sensitivity and specificity of the test can be the same, positive and negative predictive values depend on the pretest probability or disease prevalence. For example, our studies produced an increase in the positive predictive value from 82 percent among a general Estonian population with a lower lactose malabsorption prevalence of 23 percent, to 95 percent among a Russian population in Estonia with a high lactose malabsorption prevalence of 57 percent, to 99. 5 percent among a Khanty population in Siberia with a lactose malabsorption prevalence of 83 percent. 4, 5 If the test is used among patients with an increased pretest probability of lactose malabsorption, the positive predictive value of the test is higher than in the general population. In clinical practice, it is important to accept that clinical intolerance to lactose may not be synonymous with low lactase activity. When the diagnosis is confirmed by lactose testing, we prefer to speak about lactose malabsorption because our experience from hundreds of tests among the general population shows that approximately 30 percent of patients with lactose malabsorption can clinically tolerate lactose without any symptoms.

Other indirect methods used include measurement of breath hydrogen (H 2; which indicates fermentation of undigested lactose from colonic bacteria), blood glucose and urinary galactose, indicating hydrolysis of lactose. An incremental rise in breath H 2 above 20 ppm and reduction of plasma glucose below 1.11 mmol/L following lactose challenge indicate LM or LNP. Urinary galactose is frequently reported using a variety of testing procedures and reporting methods limiting direct comparisons within the literature. Grant et al. proposed that a urinary galactose/creatinine ratio after pooled 3 h collection provided the best discrimination; on this basis, a threshold of 0.1 mg/mg has been applied by subsequent studies as an absolute threshold or lactose dose extrapolation. Although these indirect measures of LNP depend on the lactose dose and substrate used (e.g. milk), validity and cut-off value specific to the substrate and dose have not been validated.

Lactose in its pure form or present in milk may be digested differently but is used interchangeably to diagnose LM. For consumers, milk is more accessible than purified lactose, and with the availability of personal devices like AIRE to detect LM, may be a simple method for at-home testing. Moreover, it has been argued that milk is a more physiologically relevant and realistic substrate than lactose for assessing LM. Milk has been used as a substrate in a variety of studies to establish LM. However, LM and LI symptoms may be influenced by the food matrix or rate of digestion thus, digestive responses may vary between isolated lactose and milk. The presence of other components in milk such as fats may reduce gastric emptying thus influencing LM markers. More importantly, diagnostic thresholds of LM measures using milk have not been validated. Recent studies have also highlighted that milk protein variants arising from species or breed differences may impact digestion and malabsorption. Notably, the predominant β-casein variants, A1 and A2 β-casein, are hypothesised to differentially impact LM, suggesting that LM markers may perform differently depending on milk protein, or specifically A1 β-casein, content.

This study aimed to establish the diagnostic accuracy of LM measures (breath H 2, plasma glucose, and urinary galactose/creatinine) to diagnose LNP using genotyping (LCT C/T 13901 and G/A 22018 SNPs) as a reference method following both lactose and milk challenges. Furthermore, the study aimed to establish diagnostic thresholds following milk with differing β-casein types.

### Significance of hydrogen breath tests in children with suspected carbohydrate malabsorption [^eba0a140]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Hydrogen breath tests (HBT) are noninvasive investigations frequently used in pediatric gastroenterology. The range of diseases that can be identified include carbohydrate intolerance, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, and orocecal transit time. In the normal individual, gut bacteria are primarily located in the colon and the distal small intestine. When defective sugar absorption is present, unabsorbed carbohydrates make up the substrate for the saccharolitic flora of the colon. Short-chain fatty acids and gases (e.g. hydrogen [H 2], methane [CH 4]) are formed from the metabolism of this flora. Human cells do not produce H 2 and CH 4. The rationale of HBT is based on the concept that part of the gas produced by colonic bacterial fermentation diffuses into the blood and is excreted by breath, where it can be quantified easily by chromatography.

Lactose maldigestion occurs when lactose is not hydrolyzed in the small intestine. It passes into the colon and through increased fluid secretion and gas production can lead to symptoms of lactose intolerance including abdominal pain, diarrhea, flatulence, bloating, nausea or vomiting. In some cases subjects can present with constipation and others are detected only because their weight gain is inadequate. A diagnosis of lactose intolerance in children requires exclusion of other clinical diagnoses such as allergy to cow's milk proteins or other foods, or intolerance to other disaccharidases. The HBT with lactose is still considered to be the most reliable, noninvasive and economical technique to measure lactose maldigestion.

Fructose is a monosaccharide occurring naturally in its free form or as sucrose (glucose plus fructose) and it is absorbed by carrier-mediated facilitated diffusion. Fructose is widely used as a sweetener in foods, beverages, and candy, and it is also present in a variety of fruits. Ingestion of high levels of fructose can lead to carbohydrate intolerance and may results in nonspecific diarrhea, excessive intestinal gas, and recurrent abdominal pain. Sorbitol is a sugar alcohol widespread in plants, particularly in fruits and juices. Sorbitol is normally only partially absorbed and simultaneous ingestion of sorbitol and fructose seems to increase malabsorption of the latter. Methodology and interpretation of results are similar to HBT with lactose. However, the role of HBT with fructose and sorbitol is uncertain and to date often not recommended in clinical practice.

### Evaluation of hematochezia in a two-day-old infant [^0f3deb38]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Hematochezia in the pediatric population, particularly infants, has a wide differential diagnosis ranging from benign to life-threatening causes. Obtaining a thorough history and identifying risk factors for more ominous disease is vital during the emergency department (ED) evaluation.

Case Report

The patient is a 2-day-old female who presented to the ED with 8–10 episodes of bright red blood in her stools. She was otherwise asymptomatic, with an uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery. Her history was significant for a sibling who recently tested positive for Escherichia coli O157:H7 in his stool and a family history of lactose intolerance. She was exclusively formula fed. An abdominal plain film was obtained and was normal. Milk protein enterocolitis was suspected and she was transitioned to hydrolyzed formula with resolution of her symptoms. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? As emergency physicians, we need to be aware of the life-threatening conditions that are associated with hematochezia, such as necrotizing enterocolitis, and act quickly. However, many patients will have benign conditions, and recognizing the key historical and diagnostic pieces of the infant's presentation will prevent unnecessary evaluations and consultations.

### Lactose intolerance but not lactose maldigestion is more frequent in patients with irritable bowel syndrome than in healthy controls: a meta-analysis [^6e4144e2]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2019). Medium credibility.

3.2 Lactose maldigestion and IBS

In 13 of the 14 articles, LM was objectively tested with LBT, LTT or genetic testing. There were not enough controlled studies with lactase activity measurement to carry out a correct statistical analysis. In one of the included case‐control studies, only subjective LI was assessed. 42

Based on the ingested lactose dose used in the different studies three subgroups were made: 10‐18 g; 20‐25 g; 40‐50 g (Figure 2). Overall there was no significant difference in the prevalence of LM between IBS and HC groups (OR = 1.122; 95% CI: 0.929‐1.356; P = 0.232). The I 2 test showed no significant heterogeneity (I 2 = 0.000%; P = 0.479). We did not find significant difference either between (P = 0.121), or within the subgroups: (1) OR = 1.420, 95% CI: 0.873‐2.309, P = 0.158 (I 2 = 0.000%; P = 0.810); (2) OR = 0.926, 95% CI: 0.711‐1.206, P = 0.568 (I 2 = 11.037%; P = 0.338); (3) OR = 1.356, 95% CI: 0.977‐1.882, P = 0.068 (I 2 = 0.000%; P = 0.651). There was no significant heterogeneity within the subgroups.

### Assessment of lactase activity in humans by measurement of galactitol and galactonate in serum and urine after milk intake [^9987ac7d]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lactose is a disaccharide composed of glucose and galactose and is found mainly in milk and dairy products, but also in many manufactured food products. The digestion of lactose requires the presence of lactase, which hydrolyses the sugar in the small intestine brush border, after which the 2 monosaccharides are absorbed via passive diffusion or active transport. In most humans, a reduction in lactase activity (LA) occurs in late childhood through epigenetic programming. Consequently, undigested lactose reaches the colonic microbiota, resulting in the production of short-chain fatty acids, hydrogen, and methane. For between one-third and one-half of individuals with such lactose maldigestion (LM), these fermentation products can cause gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, bloating, flatulence, and vomiting after the ingestion of milk products, thus defining the clinical manifestations of lactose intolerance (LI). On the other hand, ∼35% of the world's population retain intestinal LA similar to infantile levels throughout adulthood. This lactase-persistence phenotype is owing to polymorphisms in the promoter of the lactase gene (LCT) that eliminate the programmed reduction in activity of the promoter with age. Several prevalent mutations of the LCT promoter have been described in populations or ethnic groups that have a long history of herding animals, suggesting an evolutionary advantage of this phenotype in these groups.

### Fructose intolerance: an under-recognized problem [^4d0e4239]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

Although the role of lactose intolerance in the pathogenesis of abdominal symptoms is well known, the role of fructose intolerance is unclear. Our aims were 1) to examine the prevalence of fructose intolerance in patients with unexplained abdominal symptoms, and 2) to explore whether fructose concentration influences fructose breath test.

Methods

Over 2 yr, patients with unexplained symptoms answered questionnaires and underwent fructose breath tests. Patients received 50 g fructose in 150 mL water (33% solution). Breath samples were collected for hydrogen and methane. In a second study, breath test was performed after giving either 10%, 20%, or 33% fructose solution. Data were analyzed retrospectively.

Results

A total of 183 patients (50 male, 133 female) had breath tests, of whom 134 (73%) were positive. Among these, 119 (89%) had elevated H(2), and 15 (11%) had elevated CH(4) or both gases. Questionnaires showed that flatus (83%), pain (80%), bloating (78%), belching (70%), and altered bowel habit (65%) were the most common symptoms. Breath test reproduced symptoms in 101 patients (75%). In the second study, 14/36 (39%) tested positive with a 10% solution, 23/33 (70%) with a 20% solution, and 16/20 (80%) with a 33% solution (10% versus 20% or 33%, p < 0.01).

Conclusions

Fructose intolerance may cause unexplained GI symptoms. The higher yield of positive tests in our initial study may be due to referral bias or testing conditions; lower test dose produced a lower yield. Nonetheless, recognition and treatment of fructose intolerance may help many patients.

### Lactose malabsorption, irritable bowel syndrome and self-reported milk intolerance [^4a0c7aca]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2001). Low credibility.

Background

The relationship between lactose malabsorption, irritable bowel syndrome and development of intestinal symptoms is unclear, especially when the ingested dose of milk is small. Thus, the role of hydrogen breath testing in the diagnostic work-up of patients with nonspecific intestinal symptoms is still debated.

Aims

To establish the relationship between lactose malabsorption, severe self-reported milk intolerance, irritable bowel syndrome and related symptoms.

Methods

The prevalence of lactose malabsorption was prospectively assessed by means of a hydrogen breath test in 839 patients (503 with irritable bowel syndrome, based on the Rome criteria, regularly consuming milk, and 336 subjects who identified themself as milk intolerant, after an oral load of 25 g lactose). The test was considered "positive" when a hydrogen peak exceeding 20 ppm over baseline values was observed in two or more samples. Attempts were also made to establish whether the predominant presenting symptom (diarrhoea, constipation, alternating diarrhoea and constipation, pain and gaseousness) might be helpful in predicting the outcome of the breath test.

Results

The prevalence of a positive breath test was comparable in the two groups (337 patients with irritable bowel syndrome (66.9%) vs 240 patients with milk intolerance (71.4%)). The same holds true for the first peak of hydrogen excretion, total hydrogen output and prevalence of symptoms during, and in the four hours after, the test. The predominant presenting symptom was not useful for predicting outcome of the test either in regular milk users or in milk intolerant subjects.

Conclusions

The almost identical results of the lactose breath test of patients with irritable bowel syndrome and subjects with self-reported milk intolerance suggests that the two conditions overlap to such an extent that the clinical approach should be the same. A lactose breath test should always be included in the diagnostic work-up for irritable bowel syndrome, as fermentation of malabsorbed lactose is likely responsible for triggering symptoms. Conversely, lactase deficiency is probably irrelevant in most subjects not affected by irritable bowel syndrome, within a moderate milk consumption.

### Guidelines for the investigation of chronic diarrhoea in adults: British society of gastroenterology, 3rd edition [^333325a7]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Fructans are present in large concentrations in wheat, a staple of the diet for many populations (eg, bread, noodles). Fermentation of fructans by colonic bacteria is the cause of 'wheat intolerance' in many patients without coeliac disease. Similarly, sorbitol and other non-absorbed sugar alcohols ('polyols') used as artificial sweeteners pass unchanged into the colon and can induce diarrhoea if taken in large quantities (eg, diet drinks, chewing gum).

Interpretation of carbohydrate breath tests is particularly contingent on the challenge dose used. Double-blind randomised controlled dietary challenge studies show a dose-response relationship between the intake of lactose, fructose and fructans with the likelihood of malabsorption (as assessed by an increase in breath hydrogen) and the development of abdominal symptoms, including diarrhoea. The prevalence of primary lactase deficiency based on the presence of the 13 910 C/C genotype in the promoter region of the lactase enzyme gene is 2–15%, predominantly in Caucasian populations in Northern Europe. A recent meta-analysis of epidemiological data reported that 68% (95% CI 64% to 72%) of the world's population are lactase-deficient, and this approaches 100% in the Han Chinese population. There is a high level of concordance between the presence of this genotype and lactose malabsorption. In contrast, there is no unique genotype linked with fructose or fructan malabsorption and a review of nine studies found that 25 g fructose may induce an increase in breath hydrogen in 40% of healthy subjects, but rarely induces symptoms. Prospective studies have shown that self-reported dietary intolerance is a poor predictor of objective test resultsor even response to dietary restriction. Thus, breath testing after carbohydrate challenge could be useful if it identifies the cause of symptoms and predicts response to therapy. A positive lactose breath test fulfils these criteria, although avoidance of dairy products alone is rarely sufficient treatment in patients with IBS. No trials have directly addressed patients with isolated diarrhoea but, in diarrhoea-predominant IBS, two randomised controlled trialsand one prospective studyhave found no relationship between the result of breath testing and response to dietary fructose reduction. At present, fructose breath testing cannot be said to inform diagnosis and treatment of fructose intolerance.

Genetics of lactose malabsorption. (A) Organisation of the lactase genetic locus on chromosome 2. The positions of the lactase gene (LCT) and the neighbouring genes aspartyl-tRNA synthetase (DARS), minichromosome maintenance complex component 6 (MCM6) and UBX domain-containing protein 4 (UBXN4) are indicated. Polymorphisms relevant for lactose malabsorption are located within intron 13 of the MCM6 gene, upstream of the lactase gene. (B) Differential levels of methylation of intron 13 of MCM6 and the LCT gene in individuals with genetic lactose malabsorption (LCT −13910:C/C), lactose tolerance (LCT −13910:T/T) and the clinically silent, physiologically intermediate genotype LCT −13910:C/T. Hypermethylation (red colour) results in genetic silencing of the respective gene. (Source: From Labrie et al).

The LCT-13'910:T SNP associated with LP in Europe and many near Asian regions resides on the same haplotype, indicating rapid spread of a single mutation. The mutation appears in prehistoric skeletons for the first time approximately 10 500 years ago in Anatolia with spread to Europe and Northern Africa over time in line with domestication of animals. In Africa and the Middle East, different mutations in the same genetic region are responsible for LP(table 3), indicating convergent evolution.

Table 3
Genetic variations affecting lactase persistence and LM

There is convincing genetic evidence for a strong selection pressure for LP. In a whole genome analysis of skeletons originating between 6500 and 300 BC, the LCT-13'910:T allele showed increasing prevalence over time.LP provided an advantage of up to 4%–5% per generation, which is one of the largest selection pressures observed for any gene in recent human evolution and is in the same order of magnitude as resistance genes for malaria (4%–9%), skin pigmentation in Europeans (3%) and genes associated with hypoxia response in Tibetan populations at high altitude.

### Evaluation of breath, plasma, and urinary markers of lactose malabsorption to diagnose lactase non-persistence following lactose or milk ingestion [^68c8c81e]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

The accuracy of plasma glucose and urinary galactose/creatinine ratio in diagnosing LNP after a milk challenge has not yet been reported, although both are used in practice. Based on our ROC curve analysis following milk ingestion, the AUCs for plasma glucose and urinary galactose/creatinine ratio were unreliable (AUC < 0.70) and could not differentiate LP from LNP. The presence of fats and protein in milk is likely to interfere with glucose and galactose metabolism, impacting these measures. The postprandial glucose response to carbohydrate ingested with fats may reduce glucose responses due to fat-induced delayed gastric emptying. Indeed, the blood glucose response to lactose was previously shown to be lower with whole and skim milk than isolated lactose. Studies in rodents showed lowered galactosuria when fat was included in lactose-containing diets. These digestive and metabolic influences may explain the poorer accuracy of plasma glucose and urinary galactose/creatinine to reliably diagnose LNP after milk ingestion; the greater risk of false positive results with these methods should be considered prior to their use.

### A comparison of diagnostic tests for lactose malabsorption – which one is the best? [^9c1dfeeb]. BMC Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Lactose breath test with measurement of H2+CH4x2 was judged as the best test. It was superior to H2+CH4 because of better sensitivity and a somewhat higher area under the ROC-curve (tables 3 and 5). The sensitivity and specificity was 100% with cut-off levels (normal values) < 18 ppm and < 53 ppm respectively. Results in the range from 18 ppm to 52 ppm render further tests necessary to obtain a conclusive diagnosis. The agreement between H2 + CH4 and H2+CH4x2 was, as expected, very good because most subjects with LM predominantly produce H2, and the variables are slight modifications of each other. Nevertheless, H2 + CH4x2 seem to be preferable in clinical use and have satisfactory diagnostic properties.

Breath tests with measurement of only H2 have been judged as reliable tests for LM. The recently published Rome Consensus Conference report states that measurement of breath CH4 excretion is not currently recommended to improve the diagnostic accuracy of the H2 breath test due to lack of evidence, and that further studies on other gases (mainly CH4) than H2 should be encouraged. In this study, the agreement between H2 and any combination of H2 and CH4 was very good, but the lower sensitivity of H2 only made it inferior to the combination of H2 + CH4x2. Since about 30% of the adult population is so-called CH4-producers and the methanogenesis consumes large quantities of H2 to produce CH4, it is reasonable to measure CH4 in addition to H2. This study showed that measurement of CH4 in addition to H2 increased the diagnostic accuracy of the breath test and that H2 + CH4x2 was the best one despite the fact that the concentration of CH4 is variable both in fasting conditions and after meals.

### Hydrogen and methane-based breath testing in gastrointestinal disorders: the North American Consensus [^915ea6b8]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Performance of breath tests

We suggest that the correct dose of lactulose for breath testing is 10 g with or followed by one cup of water.
We suggest that the correct dose of glucose for breath testing is 75 g mixed with or followed by one cup of water.
We suggest that the correct dose of lactose for breath testing is 25 g mixed with or followed by one cup of water.
We suggest that the correct dose of fructose for breath testing is 25 g mixed with or followed by one cup of water.
We suggest that fructose and lactose breath testing should be performed for at least 3 h.
We suggest that the presence of bacterial overgrowth should be ruled out before performing lactose or fructose breath testing.
We recommend that hydrogen, methane and carbon dioxide should all be measured simultaneously during breath testing.

When performing lactulose breath tests for the determination of SIBO, the majority of studies have used a dose of 10 g. Higher doses incur the risk of speeding intestinal transit time, which could affect test data.

With regards to the glucose breath testing, variable doses of 50 g and 75–100 g have been used. Comparative studies using 50 g, 75 g or 100 g have not been performed. A 75 g dose is used for oral glucose testing in diabetics, as recommended by the World Health Organization; hence, from the practical standpoint stocking 75 g doses is less-expensive, easier to obtain for breath test centers and could provide an adequate amount of carbohydrate substrate.

In subjects with lactose and fructose intolerance, unabsorbed substrate is fermented by the colonic bacteria leading to symptoms such as gas, bloating and abdominal pain. Symptoms of lactose malabsorption generally occur after ingestion of 6–12 g lactose (120–240 mL of milk). Although high doses of lactose (≥ 50 g) have been used for lactose breath test, 25 g (equivalent of 500 mL of milk) is within the normal range of consumption and is the recommended dose.

### Subjective perception of lactose intolerance does not always indicate lactose malabsorption [^166291f1]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2010). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Symptomatic lactose intolerance is common; however, abdominal symptoms that patients experience after ingestion of lactose-containing foods can have causes beyond lactose malabsorption. We aimed to determine whether symptoms that patients usually attribute to lactose intolerance are comparable to symptoms provoked by a controlled lactose challenge and whether these symptoms are related to lactose absorption capacity.

Methods

We performed an observational, prospective, transverse study of 353 patients referred for a lactose hydrogen breath test (HBT). Patients completed a validated questionnaire about symptoms associated with consumption of dairy products at home (home symptoms). After a 50-g lactose breath test, they completed the same questionnaire again (lactose challenge symptoms). Patients were assigned to groups of absorbers or malabsorbers according to HBT results and tolerants or intolerants according to the results of the questionnaire.

Results

The total symptom score was significantly higher for home symptoms than for the lactose challenge (16 vs 8, P < .01). Symptoms perceived at home were reported to be more intense than those that followed the lactose challenge for lactose absorbers compared with malabsorbers (16 vs 4, P < .01) and lactose tolerants compared with intolerants (12 vs 2, P < .05). Overperception of lactose intolerance at home was similar in men and women.

Conclusions

Daily life symptoms that patients associate with lactose intolerance are often unrelated to lactose malabsorption. Even among true lactose malabsorbers, symptom recall tends to be amplified by the patient. Thus, conventional anamnesis is a highly unreliable tool to establish symptomatic lactose malabsorption.

### Lactose intolerance but not lactose maldigestion is more frequent in patients with irritable bowel syndrome than in healthy controls: a meta-analysis [^57aaec9d]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2019). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background and Purpose

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) affects 10%‐20% of the adult population and is characterized by abdominal symptoms without relevant organic disease. There are numerous clinical trials available investigating the relationship between IBS, lactose maldigestion (LM), and lactose intolerance (LI), but there have been no meta‐analyses on this topic yet. We aimed to assess the prevalence of LM, objective and subjective (self‐reported) LI in IBS patients compared to healthy controls (HC) without IBS.

Methods

A systematic literature search was conducted up to 24 April 2018 in PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library. Adult IBS patients had to be diagnosed according to the Rome criteria or other well‐defined criteria system. We enrolled controlled studies including healthy adult participants without IBS, as control group. Odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated.

Key Results

Altogether 14 articles were suitable for statistical analyses. IBS patients reported themselves significantly more frequently lactose intolerant than HCs (odds ratio [OR] = 3.499; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.622‐7.551). Generally, there was no significant difference in the prevalence of LM based on ingested lactose dose (OR = 1.122; 95% CI = 0.929‐1.356) and test type (OR = 1.156; 95% CI = 0.985‐1.356). However, significantly more IBS patients had objective LI (OR = 2.521; 95% CI = 1.280‐4.965).

Conclusions and Inferences

Lactose intolerance, but not LM is more frequent among patients with IBS compared to HCs. According to our results, IBS among other functional bowel disorders is a possible contributing factor of LI in people with LM.

### Significance of hydrogen breath tests in children with suspected carbohydrate malabsorption [^eb38ea7d]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Although the retrospective nature of our analyses is a clear limitation, our results support hydrogen breath tests as noninvasive and sensitive measures of carbohydrate malabsorption that can be helpful in the evaluation of children with gastrointestinal symptoms including functional intestinal disorders. A thorough history taking can guide the evaluation of single or multiple sugars to be tested. If applied for a variety of carbohydrates but only where indicated, around two-third of all children have positive results. The therapeutic consequences are successfully relieving symptoms in the vast majority of patients. The adherence to the physician's advice is excellent, as the patients and families are very content.

### Evaluation of breath, plasma, and urinary markers of lactose malabsorption to diagnose lactase non-persistence following lactose or milk ingestion [^e977af19]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Adult lactase non-persistence (LNP) is due to low lactase expression, resulting in lactose malabsorption (LM). LNP is a genetic trait, but is typically determined by LM markers including breath H 2, blood glucose, and urinary galactose after a lactose tolerance test. Known validity of these markers using milk is limited, despite being common practice. Compositional variation, such as β-casein variants, in milk may impact diagnostic efficacy. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy to detect LNP using these commonly measured LM markers after both lactose and milk challenges.

Methods

Fourty healthy young women were challenged with 50 g lactose then randomized for separate cross-over visits to ingest 750 mL milk (37.5 g lactose) as conventional (both A1 and A2 β-casein) and A1 β-casein-free (a2 Milk™) milk. Blood, breath and urine were collected prior to and up to 3 h following each challenge. The presence of C/T 13910 and G/A 22018 polymorphisms, determined by restriction fragment length polymorphism, was used as the diagnostic reference for LNP.

Results

Genetic testing identified 14 out of 40 subjects as having LNP (C/C 13910 and G/G 22018). All three LM markers (breath H 2, plasma glucose and urinary galactose/creatinine) discriminated between lactase persistence (LP) and LNP following lactose challenge with an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of 1.00, 0.75 and 0.73, respectively. Plasma glucose and urinary galactose/creatinine were unreliable (AUC < 0.70) after milk ingestion. The specificity of breath H 2 remained high (100%) when milk was used, but sensitivity was reduced with conventional (92.9%) and a2 Milk™ (78.6%) compared to lactose (sensitivities adjusted for lactose content). The breath H 2 optimal cut-off value was lower with a2 Milk™ (13 ppm) than conventional milk (21 ppm). Using existing literature cut-off values the sensitivity and specificity of breath H 2 was greater than plasma glucose to detect LNP following lactose challenge whereas values obtained for urinary galactose/creatinine were lower than the existing literature cut-offs.

Conclusion

This study showed accurate diagnosis of LNP by breath H 2 irrespective of the substrate used, although the diagnostic threshold may vary depending on the lactose substrate or the composition of the milk.
