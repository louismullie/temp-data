## Question

how long are patients on brilinta after CVA with successful tpa

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how long patients should be on Brilinta (ticagrelor) after a cerebrovascular accident treated with successful thrombolysis (tPA). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether ticagrelor is recommended at all after tPA-treated acute ischemic stroke. Then, I should verify what the pivotal evidence base (THALES) actually studied and who was excluded. Next, I will check FDA labeling for any explicit guidance or restrictions. After that, I need to assess bleeding risk data that would influence post-tPA decisions. Finally, if ticagrelor is appropriate in any subgroup, I should confirm the correct duration and dosing, and contrast that with standard post-tPA antiplatelet practice.

> Let me first confirm the core evidence base. The THALES trial randomized patients with noncardioembolic acute ischemic stroke with NIHSS ≤ 5 or high-risk TIA within 24 hours to ticagrelor (180 mg loading, then 90 mg twice daily) plus aspirin versus aspirin alone for 30 days, demonstrating a modest reduction in stroke or death at 30 days but with increased severe bleeding on combination therapy [^1125nMjM].

> Wait, let me verify who was actually included. Patients who had received thrombolysis or thrombectomy within 24 hours prior to randomization were explicitly excluded from THALES, so the trial does not inform safety or efficacy of ticagrelor after tPA or thrombectomy, which is a critical limitation for this scenario [^111P4SpK] [^1125nMjM] [^114JXPGR].

> I should confirm what the FDA label says about this exact question. The current U.S. prescribing information states that patients with NIHSS > 5 and those receiving thrombolysis were excluded from THALES; thus, use of Brilinta in such patients is not recommended. Initially, I almost called this a contraindication, but hold on, I should verify the wording — "not recommended" is a label caution, not a formal contraindication; nonetheless, it clearly advises against use post-thrombolysis due to absent evidence and bleeding concerns [^1129PSqf].

> Next, I will examine bleeding risk to understand the rationale. Even in the non-thrombolysis THALES population, ticagrelor plus aspirin increased severe bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage; pooled and trial summaries report a hazard ratio for severe bleeding around 3.99 and for intracranial hemorrhage around 3.33 compared with aspirin alone, underscoring the hemorrhagic liability that would likely be magnified in the immediate post-tPA period [^112tEvPk] [^114JXPGR] [^1125nMjM].

> Now, I need to check the appropriate regimen and duration for the population in whom ticagrelor is actually indicated. For eligible patients with minor ischemic stroke or high-risk TIA who did not receive thrombolysis, the studied and labeled course is a 180 mg loading dose followed by 90 mg twice daily for a total of 30 days on a background of aspirin 75–100 mg daily, initiated within 24 hours of symptom onset; let me double-check dosing and duration — yes, that aligns with the SPL and labeling language tied to THALES [^1147cut5] [^114jxGVx] [^1125nMjM].

> But wait, what if the stroke team is considering antiplatelet therapy after tPA — how should we proceed? Given that ticagrelor after thrombolysis is specifically not recommended by FDA labeling and was not studied in THALES, standard practice is to avoid potent DAPT immediately post-tPA and to use aspirin when deemed safe after thrombolysis once hemorrhage is excluded, whereas short-course DAPT strategies supported by CHANCE/POINT apply to minor stroke/TIA cohorts that also excluded thrombolysis, so extrapolation post-tPA is not evidence-based; the European Stroke Organisation statement supports short-term DAPT in minor stroke/TIA but does not override the lack of data in thrombolysed patients, so I need to emphasize caution here [^1129PSqf] [^112tEvPk].

> Let me reconsider any alternatives or edge cases. Ticagrelor monotherapy did not prove superior to aspirin in SOCRATES and, importantly, that trial also excluded recent thrombolysis, so there is no direct monotherapy pathway for ticagrelor post-tPA; in the absence of supportive data and with label caution, ticagrelor should be avoided after thrombolysis, and antiplatelet strategy should default to guideline-concordant aspirin-based therapy under stroke team direction once imaging rules out hemorrhage [^115xmg75] [^1129PSqf].

> In summary, I need to ensure the recommendation is clear and operational. For "successful tPA", ticagrelor is not recommended because post-thrombolysis patients were excluded from THALES and the FDA label advises against its use in this setting; therefore, no ticagrelor course or duration should be prescribed post-tPA. For patients with minor ischemic stroke or high-risk TIA who did not receive thrombolysis, the studied and labeled regimen is 30 days of ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily after a 180 mg load, co-administered with low-dose aspirin, initiated within 24 hours of onset, with close monitoring for bleeding [^1129PSqf] [^1125nMjM] [^114jxGVx] [^1147cut5].

Brilinta (ticagrelor) is **not recommended after tPA-treated stroke** [^1129PSqf] because patients receiving thrombolysis were excluded from the THALES trial [^1125nMjM] and from the FDA-approved indication [^111P4SpK]. If used off-label, the duration is **30 days** (90 mg twice daily with aspirin 75–100 mg daily) [^1125nMjM] [^1147cut5], but this is not guideline-supported and carries increased bleeding risk [^1115oNuX]. Standard practice is to use aspirin alone after tPA, and ticagrelor should be avoided in this setting [^1129PSqf] [^115xmg75].

---

## Clinical trial evidence and guidelines

- **THALES trial**: Evaluated ticagrelor plus aspirin in acute non-cardioembolic stroke or high-risk TIA [^1125nMjM], excluding patients who received thrombolysis or thrombectomy within 24 hours [^111P4SpK].

- **FDA labeling**: Indicates ticagrelor for acute ischemic stroke or TIA, but explicitly excludes patients who received thrombolysis [^1129PSqf] [^111P4SpK].

- **AHA/ASA guidelines**: Recommend aspirin alone after tPA; dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with ticagrelor is not recommended in this context.

---

## Recommended duration of ticagrelor therapy

The **standard duration** is 30 days (90 mg twice daily with aspirin 75–100 mg daily) [^1125nMjM] for patients not receiving thrombolysis [^111P4SpK] [^113bfvvQ]. Post-tPA, **ticagrelor is not recommended** [^1129PSqf]; if used off-label, limit to 30 days with careful bleeding risk assessment [^1115oNuX].

---

## Risks and benefits

The **benefits** include reduced recurrent ischemic events [^1125nMjM] [^1123TWQT] in non-thrombolysed patients [^111P4SpK], while the **risks** include increased bleeding, including intracranial hemorrhage [^112tEvPk], especially after thrombolysis [^1129PSqf].

---

## Clinical considerations

- **Bleeding risk**: High after tPA; ticagrelor increases this risk [^1129PSqf] [^1125nMjM].

- **Patient selection**: Use only in non-thrombolysed patients with minor stroke or high-risk TIA [^1125nMjM] [^111P4SpK] [^114JXPGR].

- **Monitoring**: Close monitoring for bleeding and dyspnea is required [^1129PSqf] [^113tgrnt].

## Summary table

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended ticagrelor duration** | **Evidence/guideline** |
|-|-|-|
| Non-thrombolysed minor stroke or high-risk TIA | 30 days (90 mg BID + aspirin) | - THALES trial [^1125nMjM] <br/> - FDA labeling [^1129PSqf] |
| Post-tPA stroke | Not recommended | - FDA labeling [^1129PSqf] <br/> - AHA/ASA guidelines |

Ticagrelor is **not recommended after tPA-treated stroke** [^1129PSqf] because these patients were excluded from trials [^1125nMjM] and labeling [^111P4SpK]; if used off-label, limit use to 30 days with careful bleeding risk assessment [^1115oNuX].

### European stroke organisation expedited recommendation for the use of short-term dual antiplatelet therapy early after minor stroke and high-risk TIA [^112tEvPk]. European Stroke Journal (2021). Low credibility.

In people with a non-cardioembolic mild to moderate ischaemic stroke or high-risk TIA, does early initiation of dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and ticagrelor, compared to aspirin monotherapy, reduce the risk of stroke recurrence?

The THALES study was the only identified trial and included 11,016 people with high-risk TIA or minor ischaemic stroke. Participants were given either ticagrelor plus aspirin or a matching placebo plus aspirin. Outcomes were assessed at 30-days. Compared with aspirin alone, dual antiplatelet therapy with ticagrelor and aspirin:

- **Significantly reduced the risk of ischaemic stroke**: At 30-days, the relative risk (RR) was 0.79, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.68 to 0.93, and an absolute reduction of 1.3% (moderate quality evidence).

- **Significantly reduced the risk of any stroke**: At 30-days, the RR was 0.81, with a 95% CI of 0.69 to 0.95, and an absolute reduction of 1.2% (moderate quality evidence).

- **Significantly increased the risk of intracranial haemorrhage**: The hazard ratio (HR) was 3.33, with a 95% CI of 1.34 to 8.28, and an absolute risk increase of 0.3% (low quality evidence).

- **Significantly increased the risk of severe bleeding**: The HR was 3.99, with a 95% CI of 1.74 to 9.14, P = 0.001, and an absolute risk increase of 0.4% (low quality evidence).

Across three trials, treatment with an aspirin- and clopidogrel-based DAPT regimen for 21 days following a high-risk TIA or minor stroke would be expected to prevent 26 ischaemic strokes for every 1000 patients treated but may not increase the risk of intracranial haemorrhage.

### Brilinta [^1129PSqf]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Risk of bleeding**: Drugs that inhibit platelet function, including Brilinta, increase the risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Patients treated for acute ischemic stroke or TIA with NIHSS > 5 and those receiving thrombolysis were excluded from THALES; thus, the use of Brilinta in such patients is not recommended.

- **Discontinuation of Brilinta in patients treated for coronary artery disease**: Discontinuation of Brilinta will increase the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and death in patients being treated for coronary artery disease. If Brilinta must be temporarily discontinued (e.g. to treat bleeding or for significant surgery), restart it as soon as possible. When possible, interrupt therapy with Brilinta for five days prior to surgery that has a major risk of bleeding. Resume Brilinta as soon as hemostasis is achieved.

- **Dyspnea**: In clinical trials, about 14% (PLATO and PEGASUS) to 21% (THEMIS) of patients treated with Brilinta developed dyspnea. Dyspnea was usually mild to moderate in intensity and often resolved during continued treatment but led to study drug discontinuation in 0.9% (PLATO), 1.0% (THALES), 4.3% (PEGASUS), and 6.9% (THEMIS) of patients.

	- In a substudy of PLATO, 199 subjects underwent pulmonary function testing irrespective of whether they reported dyspnea. There was no indication of an adverse effect on pulmonary function assessed after one month or after at least 6 months of chronic treatment.

If a patient develops new, prolonged, or worsened dyspnea that is determined to be related to Brilinta use, appropriate medical evaluation should be conducted.

### Brilinta [^111P4SpK]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The THALES study (NCT03354429) was conducted with 11,016 patients in a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group design to compare Brilinta 90 mg twice daily versus a placebo in patients experiencing acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). The primary endpoint of the study was the first occurrence of the composite of stroke and death within 30 days. Ischemic stroke was also evaluated as a secondary endpoint.

Participants eligible for the study were required to be 40 years or older, with a diagnosis of non-cardioembolic acute ischemic stroke (NIHSS score ≤ 5) or high-risk TIA, which was defined as an ABCD2 score ≥ 6 or ipsilateral atherosclerotic stenosis ≥ 50% in the internal carotid or an intracranial artery. Patients who received thrombolysis or thrombectomy within 24 hours prior to randomization were excluded from the study.

Randomization occurred within 24 hours of the onset of an acute ischemic stroke or TIA. Patients received either 30 days of Brilinta (90 mg twice daily, with an initial loading dose of 180 mg) or a placebo, alongside a background regimen of aspirin, initially at 300–325 mg then reduced to 75–100 mg daily. The median treatment duration was 31 days.

Brilinta demonstrated superiority over placebo in reducing the rate of the primary endpoint (composite of stroke and death), with a relative risk reduction (RRR) of 17% and an absolute risk reduction (ARR) of 1.1%. The effectiveness was primarily attributed to a significant reduction in the stroke component of the primary endpoint, showing a 19% RRR and a 1.1% ARR.

### Time course for benefit and risk of ticagrelor and aspirin in acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack [^113bfvvQ]. Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

Platelet activation remains elevated in patients for at least one month after an acute ischemic stroke or TIA, although the exact duration is uncertain. During this period, more intense antiplatelet treatment is warranted. Ticagrelor is a potent antiplatelet agent that reversibly binds and inhibits the P2Y12 receptor on platelets. In contrast to clopidogrel, ticagrelor acts directly and does not require metabolic activation. However, the efficacy benefit of intensive DAPT with ticagrelor and aspirin may come at the cost of a small increase in bleeding. No previous study has investigated the temporal course of benefit and risk to attempt to define an optimal duration of ticagrelor-aspirin treatment in patients with acute ischemic stroke or TIA.

In addition to the overall benefit and risk of ticagrelor-aspirin treatment in the THALES trial, the results of the present study suggest that the treatment benefit of ticagrelor-aspirin occurs predominantly in the first week and persists throughout the entire 30-day period. Although the present analysis indicated that ticagrelor treatment, even if initiated five days after event onset, may still be beneficial, it should not discourage emergent treatment whenever possible. In addition, the findings of initiation time of ticagrelor treatment should be considered cautiously because they are based on post hoc exploratory analysis of modeled results.

This study has several limitations. First, this secondary analysis on treatment pattern over time is exploratory and thus does not meet the standards of evidence of a primary clinical trial.

### The role of ticagrelor in acute ischaemic stroke and high-risk TIA management [^114JXPGR]. Journal of Neurology (2021). High credibility.

The THALES study is a randomized, placebo-controlled trial conducted across 414 centers in 28 countries, including Europe, Asia, and America, comparing aspirin alone to a combination of aspirin and ticagrelor for treating acute ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA). The study involved 11,016 participants with non-cardioembolic cerebral infarction and mild disability (NIHSS score ≤ 5) or high-risk TIA (ABCD2 score ≥ 6). The primary outcome was stroke or death within 30 days, with secondary outcomes including the first subsequent ischaemic stroke and disability at 30 days.

There was a significant difference in stroke or death within 30 days: 6.6% in the aspirin-only group and 5.5% in the aspirin and ticagrelor group (p = 0.02). However, there was no significant difference in disability at 30 days between these groups. The study noted a significant increase in severe bleeding in the combination therapy group (0.5% compared to 0.1% with aspirin alone, p = 0.001), which remains significant following Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons.

This study suggests a benefit of combination therapy with aspirin and ticagrelor in patients with mild-to-moderate non-cardioembolic cerebral infarction compared to aspirin alone, but with an increased bleeding risk. The number needed to treat was 92, while the number needed to harm for severe bleeding was 263. This study provides evidence to support combination therapy, although the acceptability of the bleeding risk remains unclear. It's important to note that patients who underwent thrombolysis and thrombectomy were excluded from the study.

### Ticagrelor and aspirin or aspirin alone in acute ischemic stroke or TIA [^1125nMjM]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Trials have evaluated the use of clopidogrel and aspirin to prevent stroke after an ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). In a previous trial, ticagrelor was not better than aspirin in preventing vascular events or death after stroke or TIA. The effect of the combination of ticagrelor and aspirin on the prevention of stroke has not been well studied.

- **Methods**: We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial involving patients who had a mild-to-moderate acute noncardioembolic ischemic stroke, with a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of 5 or less (range, 0 to 42, with higher scores indicating more severe stroke), or TIA and who were not undergoing thrombolysis or thrombectomy. The patients were assigned within 24 hours after symptom onset, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive a 30-day regimen of either ticagrelor (180-mg loading dose followed by 90 mg twice daily) plus aspirin (300 to 325 mg on the first day followed by 75 to 100 mg daily) or matching placebo plus aspirin. The primary outcome was a composite of stroke or death within 30 days. Secondary outcomes were the first subsequent ischemic stroke and the incidence of disability within 30 days. The primary safety outcome was severe bleeding.

- **Results**: A total of 11,016 patients underwent randomization (5523 in the ticagrelor-aspirin group and 5493 in the aspirin group). A primary-outcome event occurred in 303 patients (5.5%) in the ticagrelor-aspirin group and in 362 patients (6.6%) in the aspirin group (hazard ratio, 0.83; 95% confidence interval, 0.71 to 0.96).

### Ischemic benefit and hemorrhage risk of ticagrelor-aspirin versus aspirin in patients with acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack [^1115oNuX]. Stroke (2021). Low credibility.

This analysis from the THALES trial suggests that the benefits of a 30-day treatment with ticagrelor-aspirin outweigh the risks. In treating 1000 patients with acute mild-moderate ischemic stroke or TIA, it is expected that 12 major ischemic events would be avoided, while 3 major hemorrhages would occur compared to treatment with aspirin alone. The net benefits accrued across a spectrum of demographic and presenting characteristics.

### Brilinta [^113tgrnt]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The following adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere in the labeling: bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] and dyspnea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

- **Clinical trials experience**: Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Brilinta has been evaluated for safety in more than 58,000 patients.

- **Bleeding in PLATO (reduction in risk of thrombotic events in ACS)**: Figure 1 is a plot of time to the first non-CABG major bleeding event. Figure 1 presents the Kaplan-Meier estimate of time to the first non-CABG PLATO-defined major bleeding event (PLATO).

	- Frequency of bleeding in PLATO is summarized in Tables 1 and 2. About half of the non-CABG major bleeding events occurred within the first 30 days.
	- No baseline demographic factor altered the relative risk of bleeding with Brilinta compared to clopidogrel.

In PLATO, 1,584 patients underwent CABG surgery. The percentages of those patients who bled are shown in Figure 2 and Table 2. Figure 2 depicts 'major fatal/life-threatening' CABG-related bleeding by days from last dose of study drug to CABG procedure (PLATO). The x-axis represents days from the last dose of study drug prior to CABG.

The PLATO protocol recommended a procedure for withholding study drug prior to CABG or other major surgery without unblinding. If surgery was elective or non-urgent, study drug was temporarily interrupted, as follows: if local practic.

### Ticagrelor added to aspirin in acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack in prevention of disabling stroke: A randomized clinical trial [^1123TWQT]. JAMA Neurology (2020). High credibility.

The THALES trial demonstrated that ticagrelor, when added to aspirin, resulted in a 17% relative risk reduction of stroke or death compared to placebo added to aspirin alone, with a number needed to treat (NNT) of 92 to avoid one stroke or death at day 30. In this new analysis, ticagrelor significantly prevented disabling stroke or death, defined by an mRS greater than 1 in patients with a recurrent stroke at day 30, with an NNT of 133 to prevent one disabling stroke or death and 112 to prevent one disabling or fatal ischemic stroke. These results were strengthened by the sensitivity analysis evaluating different disability cutoffs (mRS > 2 and mRS > 3) (eFigure 3 in Supplement 2), and refuted assumptions that ticagrelor plus aspirin did not significantly reduce the risk of disabling stroke.

From both a patient perspective and for society, the prevention of a disabling stroke is the most important treatment goal. Notably, until now, among other antiplatelet strategies, only aspirin during the first 90 days following an ischemic stroke had shown a significant reduction in disabling stroke, supporting its consideration as the standard of care for the treatment of ischemic stroke within the first 30 or 90 days. In the Platelet-Oriented Inhibition in New TIA and Minor Ischemic Stroke (POINT) trial, the combination of clopidogrel plus aspirin compared with aspirin alone showed a nonsignificant reduction in disabling ischemic stroke. Indeed, clopidogrel plus aspirin only showed a significant reduction in disabling stroke or death following a pooled analysis of the CHANCE and POINT trials.

### Ticagrelor versus aspirin in acute stroke or transient ischemic attack [^115xmg75]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2016). High credibility.

The study, SOCRATES, was published by Johnston SC and colleagues in 2016 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study addresses transient ischemic attack and acute ischemic stroke.

- **Trial question**: What is the effect of ticagrelor in patients with AIS or TIA?

- **Study design**: Multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT).

- **Population**: 13,199 patients (5,483 female, 7,716 male).

- **Inclusion criteria**: Patients with non-severe ischemic stroke or high-risk TIA who had not received intravenous or intra-arterial thrombolysis and were not considered to have a cardioembolic stroke.

- **Exclusion criteria**: Specific antiplatelet therapy or anticoagulation therapy planned; carotid, cerebrovascular, or coronary revascularization that would require halting study treatment within 7 days after randomization; hypersensitivity to ticagrelor or aspirin; history of atrial fibrillation (AF), ventricular aneurysm, or suspicion of cardioembolic cause for TIA or stroke; underwent intravenous or intra-arterial thrombolysis or mechanical thrombectomy within 24 hours before randomization.

- **Interventions**:
	- **Ticagrelor group**: n = 6589 (180 mg loading dose on day 1 followed by 90 mg BID for days 2 through 90).
	- **Aspirin group**: n = 6610 (300 mg on day 1 followed by 100 mg daily for days 2 through 90).

- **Primary outcome**: No significant difference in time to occurrence of stroke, myocardial infarction, or death at 90 days (6.7% vs. 7.5%; HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.78 to 1).

### Efficacy and safety of ticagrelor monotherapy in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention: A meta-analysis [^113sbqBK]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Low credibility.

- **Methods**: Our trial was registered with PROSPERO under the ID CRD42020211516. We conducted a systematic search in PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, and Web of Science from database inception through the final search date of June 30, 2020. We used the subsequent predefined search terms: ticagrelor monotherapy AND dual antiplatelet therapy AND duration AND bleeding. No language, publication date, or publication status restrictions were applied. References of retrieved articles and prior meta‐analyses were checked for additional studies.

- **Trial eligibility and data extraction**: This study was conducted in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and performed according to established methods, as described previously. Only full‐text articles were included. Trials that (i) compared any different DAPT durations after PCI and used ticagrelor monotherapy, (ii) were randomized controlled trials, and (iii) reported on at least one of the outcomes of interest (major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, stent thrombosis (ST), all‐cause death, cardiovascular death, and major bleeding) were included. Eligible reports were assessed for methodological quality using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. Studies were excluded if one could determine, from the title or abstract, or both, that the study was not suitable for inclusion. The full text of the study was obtained and evaluated if an article could not be excluded with certainty.

### Age-dependent effect of ticagrelor monotherapy versus ticagrelor with aspirin on major bleeding and cardiovascular events: A post hoc analysis of the TICO randomized trial [^111mtYUy]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). High credibility.

Although it remains uncertain which single antiplatelet therapy is most effective and safe after short-term dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), short-term DAPT followed by aspirin monotherapy had a higher incidence of myocardial infarction, driven by a spurt of events just after DAPT cessation. This was indicated in the SMART-DATE trial (6 Versus 12-Month or Longer Dual Antiplatelet Therapy After Percutaneous Coronary Intervention in Patients With Acute Coronary Syndrome) among patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

In the STOPDAPT-2 trial (Short and Optimal Duration of Dual Antiplatelet Therapy After Everolimus-Eluting Cobalt-Chromium Stent), clopidogrel monotherapy after short-term DAPT increased the tendency, although not statistically significant, for myocardial infarction. Clopidogrel monotherapy after short-term DAPT showed a decreased response due to genetic polymorphisms, particularly in patients with ACS. Meanwhile, ticagrelor has superior pharmacodynamic effects over clopidogrel, regardless of genotype differences.

Ticagrelor monotherapy after short-term DAPT improved bleeding outcomes without increasing the risk of ischemic events after DAPT termination in recent trials. Hence, potent P2Y12 inhibitor-based monotherapy after short-term DAPT may be a good option for patients with ACS and high bleeding risk, such as elderly patients, without increasing both bleeding and ischemic risks.

### Ticagrelor added to aspirin in acute nonsevere ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack of atherosclerotic origin [^112vQdkV]. Stroke (2020). High credibility.

Among patients with a transient ischemic attack or minor ischemic strokes, those with ipsilateral atherosclerotic stenosis of the cervicocranial vasculature have the highest risk of recurrent vascular events.

- **Methods**: In the double-blind THALES (The Acute Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack Treated With Ticagrelor and ASA for Prevention of Stroke and Death) trial, we randomized patients with a noncardioembolic, nonsevere ischemic stroke, or high-risk transient ischemic attack to ticagrelor (180 mg loading dose on day 1 followed by 90 mg twice daily for days 2–30) or placebo added to aspirin (300–325 mg on day 1 followed by 75–100 mg daily for days 2–30) within 24 hours of symptom onset. The present paper reports a prespecified analysis in patients with and without ipsilateral, potentially causal atherosclerotic stenosis ≥ 30% of the cervicocranial vasculature. The primary endpoint was the time to the occurrence of stroke or death within 30 days.

- **Results**: Of 11,016 randomized patients, 2,351 (21.3%) patients had an ipsilateral atherosclerotic stenosis. After 30 days, a primary endpoint occurred in 92/1,136 (8.1%) patients with ipsilateral stenosis randomized to ticagrelor and in 132/1,215 (10.9%) randomized to placebo (hazard ratio 0.73 [95% CI, 0.56–0.96], P = 0.023), resulting in a number needed to treat of 34 (95% CI, 19–171). In patients without ipsilateral stenosis, the corresponding event rate was 211/4,387 (4.8%) and 230/4,278 (5.4%), respectively (hazard ratio, 0.89 [95% CI, 0.74–1.08]; P = 0.23, P interaction = 0.245). Severe bleeding occurred in 4 (0.4%) and 3 (text incomplete).

### Ticagrelor plus aspirin for 1 month, followed by ticagrelor monotherapy for 23 months vs aspirin plus clopidogrel or ticagrelor for 12 months, followed by aspirin monotherapy for 12 months after implantation of a drug-eluting stent: A multicentre, open-label, randomised superiority trial [^114owJzS]. Lancet (2018). Low credibility.

We hypothesized that ticagrelor, in combination with aspirin for 1 month, followed by ticagrelor alone, improves outcomes after percutaneous coronary intervention compared with standard antiplatelet regimens.

- **Methods**:
	- GLOBAL LEADERS was a randomized, open-label superiority trial conducted at 130 sites in 18 countries. Patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention with a biolimus A9-eluting stent for stable coronary artery disease or acute coronary syndromes were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive 75–100 mg of aspirin daily plus 90 mg of ticagrelor twice daily for 1 month, followed by 23 months of ticagrelor monotherapy. Alternatively, patients received standard dual antiplatelet therapy with 75–100 mg of aspirin daily plus either 75 mg of clopidogrel daily (for patients with stable coronary artery disease) or 90 mg of ticagrelor twice daily (for patients with acute coronary syndromes) for 12 months, followed by aspirin monotherapy for 12 months. Randomization was concealed, stratified by center and clinical presentation (stable coronary artery disease vs. acute coronary syndrome), and blocked, with randomly varied block sizes of two and four. The primary endpoint at 2 years was a composite of all-cause mortality or non-fatal centrally adjudicated new Q-wave myocardial infarction as assessed by a core lab in a blinded manner. The key secondary safety endpoint was site-reported bleeding assessed according to the Bleeding Academic Research Consortium criteria (grade 3 or 5). Analysis was by intention to treat.

### Brilinta [^116yw1Ci]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Ticagrelor and its major metabolite reversibly interact with the platelet P2Y12 ADP-receptor to prevent signal transduction and platelet activation. Ticagrelor and its active metabolite are approximately equipotent.

- **Pharmacodynamics**: The inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA) by ticagrelor and clopidogrel was compared in a 6-week study examining both acute and chronic platelet inhibition effects in response to 20 μM ADP as the platelet aggregation agonist. The onset of IPA was evaluated on Day 1 of the study following loading doses of 180 mg ticagrelor or 600 mg clopidogrel. As shown in Figure 5, IPA was higher in the ticagrelor group at all time points. The maximum IPA effect of ticagrelor was reached at around 2 hours and was maintained for at least 8 hours.

The offset of IPA was examined after 6 weeks on ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily or clopidogrel 75 mg daily, again in response to 20 μM ADP. As shown in Figure 6, mean maximum IPA following the last dose of ticagrelor was 88% and 62% for clopidogrel. The insert in Figure 6 shows that after 24 hours, IPA in the ticagrelor group (58%) was similar to IPA in the clopidogrel group (52%), indicating that patients who miss a dose of ticagrelor would still maintain IPA similar to the trough IPA of patients treated with clopidogrel. After 5 days, IPA in the ticagrelor group was similar to IPA in the placebo group. It is not known how either bleeding risk or thrombotic risk track with IPA, for either ticagrelor or clopidogrel.

### One-year outcomes of early therapy with ticagrelor vs clopidogrel in loss-of-function carriers with stroke or TIA trial [^1112sUQr]. Neurology (2024). High credibility.

The Ticagrelor or Clopidogrel with Aspirin in High-Risk Patients with Acute Nondisabling Cerebrovascular Events II (CHANCE-2) trial demonstrated that among Chinese patients with minor ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) who possessed CYP2C19 loss-of-function alleles, dual-antiplatelet therapy with ticagrelor-aspirin reduced the 90-day risk of stroke without increasing severe or moderate bleeding compared to clopidogrel-aspirin. The question remained whether dual-antiplatelet therapy with ticagrelor was superior to clopidogrel beyond the 90 days of follow-up. This study reports the 1-year follow-up outcomes of the CHANCE-2 trial.

- **Methods**: The CHANCE-2 trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted at 202 centers in China. Patients with a minor stroke or TIA carrying CYP2C19 loss-of-function alleles were randomized within 24 hours after symptom onset in a 1:1 ratio to receive either ticagrelor and placebo clopidogrel or clopidogrel and placebo ticagrelor for 90 days; both groups received aspirin for the first 21 days. After day 90, treatment continued according to clinician and patient choice.

- **Results**: Among 6,412 patients, the proportion of patients on different antiplatelet regimens beyond month 3 to 1 year was as follows in the ticagrelor-aspirin group: ticagrelor plus aspirin (0.09%), clopidogrel plus aspirin (1.56%), ticagrelor alone (0.13%), clopidogrel alone (2.66%), aspirin alone (73.65%), other antiplatelet (0.78%), and no antiplatelet (21.13%). Comparatively, in the clopidogrel-aspirin group, the proportions were ticagrelor plus aspirin (0.03%), clopidogrel plus aspirin (1.63%), ticagrelor alone (0.19%), clopidogrel alone (2.60%), aspirin alone (72.83%), other antiplatelet (0.66%), and no antiplatelet (22.06%).

### Ticagrelor versus clopidogrel in patients with acute coronary syndromes [^111qZNJa]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2009). High credibility.

Ticagrelor is an oral, reversible, direct-acting inhibitor of the adenosine diphosphate receptor P2Y12 that has a more rapid onset and more pronounced platelet inhibition than clopidogrel. In this multicenter, double-blind, randomized trial, we compared ticagrelor (180-mg loading dose, 90 mg twice daily thereafter) and clopidogrel (300-to-600-mg loading dose, 75 mg daily thereafter) for the prevention of cardiovascular events in 18,624 patients admitted to the hospital with an acute coronary syndrome, with or without ST-segment elevation.

At 12 months, the primary endpoint — a composite of death from vascular causes, myocardial infarction, or stroke — occurred in 9.8% of patients receiving ticagrelor as compared to 11.7% of those receiving clopidogrel (hazard ratio, 0.84; 95% confidence interval, 0.77 to 0.92; P < 0.001).

- **Secondary endpoints**: Predefined hierarchical testing showed significant differences in the rates of other composite endpoints. Myocardial infarction occurred in 5.8% of the ticagrelor group versus 6.9% in the clopidogrel group (P = 0.005). Death from vascular causes was 4.0% in the ticagrelor group compared to 5.1% in the clopidogrel group (P = 0.001). However, there was no significant difference in stroke alone (1.5% vs. 1.3%, P = 0.22).

- **Overall mortality and bleeding**: The rate of death from any cause was reduced with ticagrelor (4.5%, vs. 5.9% with clopidogrel; P < 0.001). No significant difference was found in the rates of major bleeding between the ticagrelor and clopidogrel groups (11.6% and 11.2%, respectively; P = 0.43), but ticagrelor was associated with a higher rate of major bleeding not related to coronary-artery bypass grafting.

### The use of tissue plasminogen activator in the treatment of Wallenberg syndrome caused by vertebral artery dissection [^115XTwY9]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Acute cerebrovascular accident (CVA) is a devastating cause of patient morbidity and mortality. Up to 10% of acute CVAs in young patients are caused by dissection of the vertebral or carotid artery. Wallenberg syndrome results from a CVA in the vertebral or posterior inferior artery of the cerebellum and manifests as various degrees of cerebellar dysfunction. The administration of a thrombolytic medication has been recommended in the treatment of patients with stroke caused by cervical artery dissection. Surprisingly, there is scant literature on the use of this medication in the treatment of this condition.

- **Case report**: We describe a 42-year-old man with the sudden onset of headache, left-sided neck pain, vomiting, nystagmus, and ataxia 1 hour after completing a weightlifting routine. Computed tomography angiography revealed a grade IV left vertebral artery injury with a dissection flap extending distally and resulting in complete occlusion. Subsequent magnetic resonance imaging and angiography demonstrated acute left cerebellar and lateral medullary infarcts, consistent with Wallenberg syndrome. The patient was treated with tissue plasminogen activator, which failed to resolve his symptoms.

- **Importance for emergency physicians**: Emergency physicians frequently manage patients with acute CVAs. For select patients, the administration of tissue plasminogen activator can improve outcomes. However, the risk of major hemorrhage with this medication is significant. Cervical artery dissection is an important cause of acute stroke in young patients and is often underrecognized.

### Combination antiplatelet therapy for secondary stroke prevention: Enhanced efficacy or double trouble [^116hj8Go]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

The evaluation of antithrombotic agents for secondary stroke prevention has focused on stroke reduction, with this analysis specifically aimed at examining the increase in bleeding risk. The annualized rates of total and major bleeding events in secondary stroke prevention trials of antithrombotics were assessed and cross-compared. A Medline search for major randomized clinical studies with a follow-up duration of at least one year identified 13 studies. Pooled datasets were used to compare mean bleeding rates for aspirin (≤ 325 mg/day), clopidogrel, anticoagulants (warfarin and other vitamin K antagonists), aspirin plus clopidogrel, and aspirin plus extended-release dipyridamole (ER-DP).

- **Total bleeding rates**: Mean rates of total bleeding were 4.8% with aspirin (≤ 325 mg/day) alone, 2.9% with clopidogrel alone, 3.6% with aspirin plus ER-DP, 10.1% with aspirin plus clopidogrel, and 16.8% with anticoagulation.

- **Major bleeding rates**: Mean rates of major bleeding were 1% with aspirin (≤ 325 mg/day) alone, 0.85% with clopidogrel, 0.93% with aspirin plus ER-DP, 1.7% with aspirin plus clopidogrel, and 2.5% with anticoagulation.

In conclusion, the combination of aspirin and clopidogrel is associated with significantly greater bleeding than either aspirin (≤ 325 mg/day) or clopidogrel alone. Aspirin plus ER-DP has a greater bleeding rate than clopidogrel but a lower rate than aspirin (≤ 325 mg/day) alone.

### Brilinta [^111EvHGb]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

In a prenatal/postnatal study, pregnant rats received ticagrelor at doses of 10 to 180 mg/kg/day during late gestation and lactation. Pup death and effects on pup growth were observed at 180 mg/kg/day (approximately 10 times the MRHD on a mg/m² basis). Relatively minor effects such as delays in pinna unfolding and eye opening occurred at doses of 10 and 60 mg/kg (approximately one-half and 3.2 times the MRHD on a mg/m² basis).

- **Lactation**:

	**Risk Summary**: There are no data on the presence of ticagrelor or its metabolites in human milk, nor are there known effects on the breastfed infant or on milk production. Ticagrelor and its metabolites were present in rat milk at higher concentrations than in maternal plasma. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with Brilinta.

- **Pediatric use**: The safety and effectiveness of Brilinta have not been established in pediatric patients. Effectiveness was not demonstrated in an adequate and well-controlled study conducted in 101 Brilinta-treated pediatric patients, aged 2 to < 18, for reducing the rate of vaso-occlusive crises in sickle cell disease.

- **Geriatric use**: About half of the patients in the PLATO, PEGASUS, THEMIS, and THALES studies were ≥ 65 years of age, and at least 15% were ≥ 75 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between elderly and younger patients.

- **Hepatic impairment**: Ticagrelor is metabolized by the liver, and impaired hepatic function can increase risks for bleeding and other adverse effects.

### When less becomes more: Insights on the pharmacodynamic effects of aspirin withdrawal in patients with potent platelet P2Y inhibition induced by ticagrelor [^116162N6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

Dual-antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and a P2Y12 inhibitor is recommended by guidelines to reduce the risk of thrombotic complications and ischemic events in patients experiencing an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and in those undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. This strategy was developed in light of the synergism in antithrombotic effects achieved with blockade of both the cyclooxygenase 1 enzyme induced by aspirin and the P2Y12 signaling pathway by selective inhibitors (i.e. clopidogrel, prasugrel, and ticagrelor). In this context, clopidogrel has been the most studied P2Y12 inhibitor in pharmacodynamic investigations. The potent P2Y12 inhibitors prasugrel and ticagrelor followed the footsteps of investigations using clopidogrel and were developed for patients with ACS in adjunct to aspirin as an unmovable backbone therapy.

Although improvements in the design of coronary stents and intravascular techniques have made the duration of DAPT for preventing stent thrombosis a less critical issue than in the past, it is also known that extended DAPT duration in high‐risk subjects exerts a protective effect not only on stented coronary segments but on the coronary vasculature as a whole. The emphasis on a mandatory and possibly extended period of DAPT comes despite the known and unavoidable risk of bleeding complications. Twenty years of DAPT trials have established this approach as a reference standard, and therefore trials investigating emerging strategies to reduce bleeding typically use guideline‐recommended DAPT as a control.

### Efficacy and safety of ticagrelor and aspirin in patients with moderate ischemic stroke: An exploratory analysis of the THALES randomized clinical trial [^116Qu4LF]. JAMA Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Prior trials of dual antiplatelet therapy excluded patients with moderate ischemic stroke. These patients were included in the Acute Stroke or Transient Ischaemic Attack Treated with Ticagrelor and ASA for Prevention of Stroke and Death (THALES) trial, but results have not been reported separately, raising concerns about safety and efficacy in this subgroup.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor plus aspirin in patients with moderate ischemic stroke (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS] score of 4 to 5).

- **Design, setting, and participants**: The THALES trial was a randomized trial conducted at 414 hospitals in 28 countries between January 2018 and December 2019. This exploratory analysis compared patients with moderate stroke (baseline NIHSS score of 4 to 5) with patients with less severe stroke (NIHSS score of 0 to 3). A total of 9983 patients with stroke were included in the present analysis, after excluding 2 patients with NIHSS scores greater than 5 and 1031 patients with transient ischemic attack. Data were analyzed from March to April 2021.

- **Interventions**: Ticagrelor (180-mg loading dose on day 1 followed by 90 mg twice daily on days 2 to 30) or placebo within 24 hours after symptom onset. All patients received aspirin, 300 to 325 mg, on day 1 followed by aspirin, 75 to 100 mg, daily on days 2 to 30. Patients were observed for 30 additional days.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary outcome was time to stroke or death within 30 days. The primary safety outcome was time to severe bleeding.

### Efficacy and safety of ticagrelor monotherapy in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention: A meta-analysis [^112ngrFb]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). High credibility.

- **Objective**: This meta-analysis aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor monotherapy in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The study collates data from several trials to provide a comprehensive understanding of the outcomes associated with ticagrelor use in this context.

- **Methods**: The analysis incorporated various clinical trials that compare ticagrelor monotherapy with other treatment options in patients who have undergone PCI. These trials were carefully selected based on predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria to ensure a robust comparison of outcomes.

- **Results**: The findings suggest that ticagrelor monotherapy is associated with a favorable safety profile and efficacy in reducing thrombotic events compared to dual antiplatelet therapy. Statistical analysis indicates a significant reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events in the ticagrelor group.

- **Conclusions**: Ticagrelor monotherapy may represent a viable option for patients undergoing PCI, offering potential advantages in terms of safety and efficacy over traditional dual antiplatelet treatment regimens. Further studies are recommended to confirm these findings and to explore the underlying mechanisms.

### Optimal duration of dual antiplatelet therapy after percutaneous coronary intervention with drug eluting stents: Meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^111w1ne4]. BMJ (2015). Low credibility.

Repeat revascularisation and cerebrovascular accidents data were available from seven studies (n = 16,351). Short-term duration of dual antiplatelet therapy yielded similar results compared to a 12-month duration, with an event rate of 3.06% (153/4,994 patients) versus 2.63% (132/5,026). The odds ratio was 1.17 (95% confidence interval 0.92 to 1.48); P = 0.20; I² = 0%. Results with extended dual antiplatelet therapy were comparable to those with 12-month therapy, showing 2.80% (89/3,176) versus 2.35% (74/3,155). The odds ratio was 1.20 (0.88 to 1.64); P = 0.25; I² = 0%.

All studies (n = 32,287) provided data for cerebrovascular accidents. These events occurred in 0.45% of patients (36/7,975) with short-term dual antiplatelet therapy versus 0.49% (39/8,020) with 12-month therapy. The odds ratio was 0.93 (95% confidence interval 0.59 to 1.46); P = 0.75; I² = 0%. Similarly, no significant differences in cerebrovascular accidents were noted when comparing extended duration with 12-month duration, with corresponding rates of 0.78% versus 0.84%. The odds ratio was 0.93 (0.66 to 1.31); P = 0.67; I² = 0%.

### Ticagrelor versus clopidogrel after fibrinolytic therapy in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction: Rationale and design of the ticagrelor in patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction treated with thrombolysis (TREAT) trial [^115y7t6D]. American Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

The safety and efficacy of ticagrelor in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) treated with fibrinolytic therapy remain uncertain.

- **Objectives**: The primary objective of the Ticagrelor in Patients with ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction Treated with Thrombolysis (TREAT) trial is to evaluate the short-term safety of ticagrelor compared with clopidogrel in STEMI patients treated with fibrinolytic therapy. Key secondary objectives are to assess the safety and efficacy of ticagrelor compared with clopidogrel at 12 months.

- **Design**: The TREAT trial is a multicenter, randomized, phase III, Prospective Randomized Open Blinded End-point (PROBE) study that enrolled 3,799 patients in 152 sites from 10 countries. Following the administration of fibrinolytic therapy, patients were randomized to a loading dose of ticagrelor 180 mg or clopidogrel 300 mg, followed by a maintenance dose of ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily or clopidogrel 75 mg/day for 12 months. The primary outcome is the rate of TIMI major bleeding at 30 days and will be assessed for non-inferiority using an intention-to-treat analysis. Co-treatments include aspirin and anticoagulants. Other evidence-based therapies are also recommended. Secondary efficacy outcomes include a composite of death from vascular causes, myocardial infarction, stroke, severe re-ischemia, transient ischemic attack, or other arterial thrombotic event. All-cause mortality as well as individual components of the combined efficacy endpoint will also be ascertained.

### Efficacy and safety of ticagrelor monotherapy by clinical presentation: Pre-specified analysis of the GLOBAL LEADERS trial [^111wXa5s]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

Guidelines recommend dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and clopidogrel for a duration of 6 to 12 months following percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients with stable coronary artery disease (SCAD), and DAPT with aspirin and a potent P2Y12 inhibitor (ticagrelor or prasugrel) for a duration of 12 months in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Long-term aspirin monotherapy is recommended for all patients.

In the advent of potent P2Y12 inhibitors, more evidence is needed on antiplatelet strategies that optimize the balance between bleeding risk and cardiovascular protection in ACS and SCAD. For instance, in the PLATO (Platelet Inhibition and Patient Outcomes) trial, treatment with ticagrelor as compared with clopidogrel (both given in combination with aspirin) reduced the rate of major adverse cardiac events and all-cause mortality in patients with ACS. However, ticagrelor has not been tested in the setting of elective PCI for SCAD.

Likewise, the optimal dose and duration of aspirin therapy in combination with ticagrelor has not been investigated. Indeed, the establishment of aspirin as the main antiplatelet used after PCI stems from studies that are outdated with contemporary practice. Whether monotherapy with more potent antiplatelet medications may obviate the need for combination treatment with aspirin warrants further study in ACS and SCAD.

In the GLOBAL LEADERS trial, the experimental regimen consisting of ticagrelor and aspirin DAPT for 1 month, followed by ticagrelor monotherapy for 23 months, was not superior to standard DAPT.

### Review of the ticagrelor trials evidence base [^11786Jmq]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

Ticagrelor is a platelet P2Y12 receptor inhibitor approved for use in patients with acute coronary syndromes, coronary artery disease, and low to moderate risk acute ischemic stroke or high-risk transient ischemic attack. Clinical trials have evaluated the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor on ischemic and bleeding outcomes for different indications and with varying treatment approaches. As a result, there is a large body of clinical evidence demonstrating different degrees of net clinical benefit compared with other platelet inhibitor drugs based on indication, patient characteristics, clinical presentation, treatment duration, and other factors.

We provide a review of the major trials of ticagrelor in the context of other randomized trials of clopidogrel and prasugrel to organize the volume of available information, elevate corroborating and conflicting data, and identify potential gaps as areas for further exploration of optimal antiplatelet treatment.

### Brilinta [^114Q1dez]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

A wide variety of baseline and procedural differences between the US and non-US sites (including intended invasive vs. planned medical management, and use of GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors, drug-eluting vs. bare-metal stents) were examined to see if they could account for regional differences. However, with one exception, aspirin maintenance dose, these differences did not appear to lead to differences in outcome.

- **Aspirin dose**: The PLATO protocol left the choice of aspirin maintenance dose up to the investigator, resulting in different use patterns at US sites compared to those outside the US. About 8% of non-US investigators administered aspirin doses above 100 mg, and about 2% administered doses above 300 mg. In the US, 57% of patients received doses above 100 mg and 54% received doses above 300 mg. Overall results favored Brilinta when used with low maintenance doses (≤ 100 mg) of aspirin, and results analyzed by aspirin dose were similar in the US and elsewhere. Figure 10 shows overall results by median aspirin dose. Figure 12 shows results by region and dose.

- **CV death, MI, stroke by maintenance aspirin dose in the US and outside the US (PLATO)**: Like any unplanned subset analysis, especially one where the characteristic is not a true baseline characteristic but may be determined by usual investigator practice, the above analyses must be treated with caution. It is notable, however, that aspirin dose predicts outcome in both regions with a similar pattern, and that the pattern is similar for the two major components of the primary endpoint, CV death and non-fatal MI.

### Review of the ticagrelor trials evidence base [^114ybFvn]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Low credibility.

It is challenging to compare the results of antiplatelet therapy across different randomized clinical trials because of differences in endpoint definitions, primary endpoints, and patient populations. Nevertheless, a review of the ticagrelor randomized clinical trial evidence base — in the context of decreased ischemic risk in the treatment era and increased emphasis on bleeding risk and net clinical benefit — suggests that clinical conventional wisdom and clinical trial guideline support for the superior benefit of more potent platelet P2Y12 receptor inhibition with ticagrelor compared with clopidogrel may be overemphasized.

### Brilinta [^113M5apb]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Ticagrelor demonstrates dose-proportional pharmacokinetics, which are similar in patients and healthy volunteers.

- **Absorption**: Brilinta can be taken with or without food. Absorption of ticagrelor occurs with a median tmax of 1.5 hours (range 1.0–4.0). The formation of the major circulating metabolite, AR-C124910XX (active), from ticagrelor occurs with a median tmax of 2.5 hours (range 1.5–5.0).

The mean absolute bioavailability of ticagrelor is about 36% (range 30%–42%). Ingestion of a high-fat meal had no effect on ticagrelor Cmax but resulted in a 21% increase in AUC. The Cmax of its major metabolite was decreased by 22% with no change in AUC.

Brilinta as crushed tablets mixed in water, given orally or administered through a nasogastric tube into the stomach, is bioequivalent to whole tablets (AUC and Cmax within 80%–125% for ticagrelor and AR-C124910XX) with a median tmax of 1.0 hour (range 1.0–4.0) for ticagrelor and 2.0 hours (range 1.0–8.0) for AR-C124910XX.

### Ticagrelor added to aspirin in acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack in prevention of disabling stroke: a randomized clinical trial [^1178ik8g]. JAMA Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

In the THALES trial, we randomized patients with a noncardioembolic, nonsevere ischemic stroke or high-risk TIA to receive ticagrelor (180-mg loading dose on day 1 followed by 90 mg, twice daily, for days 2–30) or placebo within 24 hours of symptom onset. All patients received aspirin (300–325 mg on day 1 followed by 75–100 mg daily for days 2–30). In the THALES trial, we prespecified an exploratory analysis on the outcome of disability following a recurrent stroke. This analysis included a comparison of the proportion of disabling strokes with mRS greater than 1 (mRS = 6 being death) at 30 days in both groups and of mRS distribution of recurrent ischemic strokes at 30 days.

### SPL drug information for ticagrelor [^113uDpTV]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Regarding the use of ticagrelor PO (also known as Brilinta) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: use only if benefits outweigh potential risks. There is evidence of fetal harm in animals. In Australia and the UK, the use is not recommended. In the US, ticagrelor should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Furthermore, ticagrelor should be used with extreme caution near term and during labor and obstetric delivery because of the possibility of maternal postpartum hemorrhage.

### Clopidogrel versus ticagrelor or prasugrel in patients aged 70 years or older with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome (POPULAR AGE): The randomised, open-label, non-inferiority trial [^114tnw1A]. Lancet (2020). High credibility.

Guidelines recommend potent platelet inhibition with ticagrelor or prasugrel in patients after an acute coronary syndrome. However, data about optimal platelet inhibition in older patients are scarce. We aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of clopidogrel compared with ticagrelor or prasugrel in older patients with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS).

- **Methods**: We conducted the open-label, randomised controlled POPular AGE trial in 12 sites (ten hospitals and two university hospitals) in the Netherlands. Patients aged 70 years or older with NSTE-ACS were enrolled and randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio using an internet-based randomisation procedure with block sizes of six to receive a loading dose of clopidogrel 300 mg or 600 mg, or ticagrelor 180 mg or prasugrel 60 mg, followed by a maintenance dose for the duration of 12 months (clopidogrel 75 mg once daily, ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily, or prasugrel 10 mg once daily) on top of standard care. Patients and treating physicians were aware of the allocated treatment strategy, but the outcome assessors were masked to treatment allocation. The primary bleeding outcome consisted of PLATelet inhibition and patient Outcomes (PLATO; major or minor bleeding [superiority hypothesis]). The co-primary net clinical benefit outcome consisted of all-cause death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and PLATO major and minor bleeding (non-inferiority hypothesis, margin of 2%). The follow-up duration was 12 months. Analyses were done on an intention-to-treat basis. This trial is registered with the Netherlands Trial Register (NL3804).

### Comparison of ticagrelor and clopidogrel in patients with acute coronary syndrome at high bleeding or ischemic risk [^114ctj2H]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Guidelines recommend individualizing the choice and duration of P2Y12 inhibitor therapy based on the trade-off between bleeding and ischemic risk. However, it is unclear whether a potent P2Y12 inhibitor (ticagrelor) or a less potent one (clopidogrel) is more appropriate for patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in the setting of high bleeding or ischemic risk. The study aimed to compare the clinical outcomes of clopidogrel and ticagrelor in patients with ACS at high bleeding or ischemic risk.

A total of 5,713 patients with ACS were included in this retrospective study. The Cox proportional hazard regression model was adjusted by applying the inverse probability weighted approach to reduce treatment selection bias. The primary clinical outcome was all-cause death. Secondary outcomes included in-hospital death, ACS, target vessel revascularization, stent thrombosis, stroke, or clinically significant or major bleeding. The median follow-up duration was 53.6 months.

After using a multivariable Cox model with an inverse probability weighted approach, all-cause death in the overall population and subgroups of patients at high bleeding risk and/or at high ischemic risk were not significantly different between clopidogrel and ticagrelor. Rates for secondary outcomes were also similar between the groups. In conclusion, ticagrelor and clopidogrel are associated with comparable clinical outcomes in patients with ACS, irrespective of bleeding and ischemic risk.

### Ticagrelor effects on myocardial infarction and the impact of event adjudication in the PLATO (Platelet Inhibition and Patient Outcomes) trial [^112vTAnQ]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

This study sought to report the treatment effect of ticagrelor on myocardial infarction (MI) and the strategy for and impact of event adjudication in the PLATO (Platelet Inhibition and Patient Outcomes) trial.

In PLATO, ticagrelor reduced cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS).

A clinical events committee (CEC) prospectively defined and adjudicated all suspected MI events, based on reports by investigators and triggers from biomarkers. Treatment comparisons used CEC-adjudicated data and, per protocol, excluded silent MI cases.

Overall, 1,299 MIs (610 ticagrelor, 689 clopidogrel) reported by the CEC occurred during the trial. Of these, 1,097 (504 ticagrelor, 593 clopidogrel) contributed to the primary composite endpoint. Site investigators reported 1,198 MIs (580 ticagrelor, 618 clopidogrel). Ticagrelor significantly reduced overall MI rates, with 12-month CEC-adjudicated Kaplan-Meier rates showing 5.8% for ticagrelor and 6.9% for clopidogrel (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.84; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.75 to 0.95). Nonprocedural MI (HR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.74 to 1.01) and MI related to percutaneous coronary intervention or stent thrombosis tended to be lower with ticagrelor. MI cases related to coronary artery bypass graft surgery were few, but a numerical excess was observed in patients assigned ticagrelor. Analyses of overall MIs using investigator-reported data showed similar results but did not reach statistical significance (HR: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.78 to 1.00).

In patients with ACS, ticagrelor significantly reduced MI compared to clopidogrel.

### Efficacy and safety of ticagrelor monotherapy by clinical presentation: Pre-specified analysis of the GLOBAL LEADERS trial [^116EeErJ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). High credibility.

The TWILIGHT (Ticagrelor with Aspirin or Alone in High‐Risk Patients after Coronary Intervention) trial examined a patient population with higher ischemic risk undergoing treatment with ticagrelor monotherapy after 3 months of DAPT, compared with DAPT using aspirin and ticagrelor for the duration of 12 months. In the subgroup of patients with ACS, TWILIGHT demonstrated that ticagrelor monotherapy after 3 months of DAPT reduced the incidence of BARC 2, 3, or 5 bleeding by 53% (hazard ratio, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.36–0.61). The results of TWILIGHT are consistent with our subgroup analysis in ACS, which showed a 48% reduction in the incidence of BARC 3 or 5 bleeding (RR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.33–0.81), while preserving efficacy for ischemic outcomes.

Together, the TWILIGHT trial and our subgroup analysis suggest a role for stopping aspirin within 3 months after PCI in patients with ACS receiving ticagrelor, to decrease bleeding risk while preserving efficacy for ischemic endpoints, compared with standard DAPT up to 12 months after implantation of drug‐eluting stents. Conversely, our experimental strategy does not seem to convey a benefit when predominantly compared with clopidogrel in patients with SCAD, neither in terms of efficacy nor safety.

### Ticagrelor versus clopidogrel in minor stroke or transient ischemic attack with intracranial artery stenosis: A post hoc analysis of CHANCE-2 [^1127pixL]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

The efficacy primary outcome was a new ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke within 90 days. Secondary efficacy outcomes included new ischemic stroke within 90 days; new ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke within 30 days; a vascular event (composite of stroke, TIA, myocardial infarction, and vascular death); disabling stroke (with modified Rankin Scale [mRS] score ≥ 2) within 90 days; and ordinal severity of stroke or TIA within 90 days. The severity was measured by a 6-level scale, including subsequent stroke or TIA events and the mRS score at 3 months as follows: fatal stroke (stroke with subsequent score on the mRS of 6); severe stroke (stroke with the subsequent score on the mRS of 4 or 5); moderate stroke (stroke with subsequent score on the mRS of 2 or 3); or mild stroke (stroke with subsequent score on the mRS of 0 or 1), TIA, and no stroke or TIA.

The primary safety outcome was severe or moderate bleeding, defined according to the GUSTO (Global Utilization of Streptokinase and Tissue Plasminogen Activator for Occluded Coronary Arteries) criteria at 90 days. Secondary safety outcomes included any bleeding, mild bleeding, and death through 90 days of follow-up. Members of an independent clinical-event adjudication committee, who were unaware of the trial group assignments, confirmed all reported efficacy and safety outcomes based on available medical records, including imaging.

### Ticagrelor versus clopidogrel in patients with acute coronary syndromes [^115myrjm]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2009). High credibility.

The study PLATO, published by Wallentin L and colleagues in 2009 in the journal *The New England Journal of Medicine*, focuses on the diseases: ST-elevation myocardial infarction, non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, and unstable angina.

- **Trial question**: What is the effect of ticagrelor in patients with acute coronary syndromes?

- **Study design**: Multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT).

- **Population**: 18,624 patients (5,288 female, 13,336 male). The inclusion criteria comprised patients admitted to the hospital with acute coronary syndrome, with or without ST-segment elevation. Key exclusion criteria included any contraindication against using clopidogrel, fibrinolytic therapy within 24 hours before randomization, the need for oral anticoagulation therapy, increased risk of bradycardia, and concomitant therapy with a strong cytochrome P-450 3A inhibitor or inducer.

- **Interventions**:
	- **Ticagrelor**: n = 9,333 (180 mg loading dose, 90 mg BID thereafter)
	- **Clopidogrel**: n = 9,291 (300–600 mg loading dose, 75 mg daily thereafter)

- **Primary outcome**: A significant decrease in death from vascular causes, myocardial infarction, or stroke (9.8% vs. 11.7%; HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.92).

- **Secondary outcomes**:
	- Significant decrease in myocardial infarction (5.8% vs. 6.9%; HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.95).
	- Significant decrease in death from vascular causes (4% vs. 5.1%; HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.91).
	- Significant decrease in death from any cause (4.5% vs. 5.9%).

### Effectiveness and safety of ticagrelor monotherapy after short-duration dual antiplatelet therapy in PCI patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1132DAyW]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), consisting of aspirin and a P2Y12 inhibitor, is the standard treatment for patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with drug-eluting stents (DES). However, the optimal duration of DAPT remains debated due to the need to balance ischemic event reduction with bleeding risks. This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor monotherapy after short-duration DAPT (1 to 3 months) compared to extended DAPT, focusing on major bleeding and cardiovascular outcomes.

A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing ticagrelor monotherapy after short-duration DAPT to extended DAPT were identified from PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library. Data on major bleeding, major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE), myocardial infarction, stroke, stent thrombosis, and mortality were analyzed. Risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using a random-effects model.

Five RCTs involving 32,393 patients were included. Ticagrelor monotherapy significantly reduced MACCE (RR: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.77 to 0.99; p = 0.04) and major bleeding (RR: 0.53; 95% CI: 0.37 to 0.77; p = 0.0008) compared to extended DAPT. It also significantly reduced all-cause mortality (RR: 0.82; 95% CI: 0.67 to 0.99; p = 0.04) and cardiovascular death (RR: 0.68; 95% CI: 0.49 to 0.94; p = 0.02). The incidence of myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis, and stroke were similar between the groups. Net adverse clinical events (NACE) were pending further analysis.

### Brilinta [^114jxGVx]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Advise patients who miss a dose of Brilinta to take their next dose at its scheduled time. For patients who are unable to swallow tablets whole, Brilinta tablets can be crushed, mixed with water, and drunk. The mixture can also be administered via a nasogastric tube (CH8 or greater) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Do not administer Brilinta with another oral P2Y12 platelet inhibitor. Avoid aspirin at doses higher than recommended [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

- **Acute coronary syndrome or a history of myocardial infarction**: Initiate treatment with a 180 mg loading dose of Brilinta. Administer the first 90 mg maintenance dose of Brilinta 6 to 12 hours after the loading dose. Administer 90 mg of Brilinta twice daily during the first year after an ACS event. After one year, administer 60 mg of Brilinta twice daily. Initiate Brilinta with a daily maintenance dose of aspirin of 75 mg to 100 mg. However, in patients who have undergone percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), consider single antiplatelet therapy with Brilinta based on the evolving risk for thrombotic versus bleeding events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Studies (14)].

- **Coronary artery disease but no prior stroke or myocardial infarction**: Administer 60 mg of Brilinta twice daily. Generally, use Brilinta with a daily maintenance dose of aspirin of 75 mg to 100 mg [see Clinical Studies (14)].

- **Acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA)**: Initiate treatment with a 180 mg loading dose of Brilinta and then continue with 90 mg twice daily.

### Brilinta [^111vQweK]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

PLATO patients were predominantly male (72%) and Caucasian (92%). About 43% of patients were over 65 years of age, and 15% were over 75 years. The median exposure to the study drug was 276 days. Approximately half of the patients received pre-study clopidogrel, and about 99% of the patients received aspirin at some time during PLATO. Around 35% of patients were receiving a statin at baseline, and 93% received a statin sometime during PLATO.

Table 7 presents the study results for the primary composite endpoint and the contribution of each component to this primary endpoint. Separate secondary endpoint analyses were conducted for the overall occurrence of cardiovascular (CV) death, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and overall mortality.

The Kaplan-Meier curve illustrates the time to the first occurrence of the primary composite endpoint of CV death, non-fatal MI, or non-fatal stroke in the overall study population. The curves separate by 30 days [relative risk reduction (RRR) of 12%] and continue to diverge throughout the 12‑month treatment period (RRR of 16%).

Among 11,289 patients with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) receiving any stent during PLATO, there was a lower risk of stent thrombosis (1.3% for adjudicated "definite") compared to clopidogrel (1.9%) (hazard ratio 0.67, 95% confidence interval 0.50–0.91; p = 0.009). The results were similar for both drug-eluting and bare metal stents.

### De-escalation to ticagrelor monotherapy versus 12 months of dual antiplatelet therapy in patients with and without acute coronary syndromes: A systematic review and individual patient-level meta-analysis of randomised trials [^115wy1i5]. Lancet (2024). High credibility.

Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) for 12 months is the standard of care after coronary stenting in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). This individual patient-level meta-analysis aimed to summarize the evidence comparing DAPT de-escalation to ticagrelor monotherapy versus continuing DAPT for 12 months after coronary drug-eluting stent implantation.

- **Methods**: A systematic review and individual patient data (IPD)-level meta-analysis of randomised trials with centrally adjudicated endpoints was performed to evaluate the comparative efficacy and safety of ticagrelor monotherapy (90 mg twice a day) after short-term DAPT (from 2 weeks to 3 months) versus 12-month DAPT in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention with a coronary drug-eluting stent. Randomised trials comparing P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy with DAPT after coronary revascularisation were searched in Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, and two websites (www.tctmd.com and www.escardio.org) from database inception up to May 20, 2024. Trials that included patients with an indication for long-term oral anticoagulants were excluded.

The risk of bias was assessed using the revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. The principal investigators of the eligible trials provided IPD by means of an anonymised electronic dataset. The three ranked coprimary endpoints were major adverse cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events (MACCE; a composite of all-cause death, myocardial infarction, or stroke) tested for non-inferiority in the per-protocol population, and Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC) 3 or 5.

### Ticagrelor-based antiplatelet regimens in patients with atherosclerotic artery disease-a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^113XNn9h]. American Heart Journal (2020). High credibility.

Randomized trials did not consistently support the superiority of ticagrelor, whether as monotherapy or in combination with aspirin, in terms of efficacy or safety, for patients with atherosclerotic artery disease.

- **Methods**: Medline, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and scientific session abstracts were searched for trials of patients with coronary or peripheral artery disease (with > 1,000 participants and a follow-up ≥ 3 months) randomly assigned to ticagrelor-based or conventional antiplatelet therapies. Trial-level hazard ratios (HRs) were pooled using a fixed- or random-effect model (in cases of significant heterogeneity) with inverse variance weighting. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Other outcomes included myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and major bleeding.

- **Results**: Overall, 77,489 patients received either ticagrelor-based (n = 38,721) or conventional antiplatelet regimens (n = 38,768) in six trials. The primary outcome occurred in 4.5% of patients treated with experimental therapy and 4.9% of patients treated with control therapy (HR = 0.91, 95% CI 0.81–1.01; p = 0.07). Overall, patients treated with ticagrelor-based versus conventional antiplatelet regimens showed no significant difference in terms of all-cause death, MI, stroke, or major bleeding after 20 months. However, in trials of patients with coronary artery disease as the primary diagnosis, the risk for all-cause death (HR = 0.84 [0.77–0.91], P < .001) and MI (HR = 0.87 [0.80–0.94], P = 0.007) was significantly reduced by experimental therapy.

### Brilinta [^113FoHyd]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Severe hepatic impairment**: Avoid use of Brilinta in patients with severe hepatic impairment, as it is likely to increase the serum concentration of ticagrelor. There are no studies of Brilinta in patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

- **Central sleep apnea**: Central sleep apnea (CSA), including Cheyne-Stokes respiration (CSR), has been reported in the post-marketing setting in patients taking ticagrelor, including recurrence or worsening of CSA/CSR following rechallenge. If central sleep apnea is suspected, consider further clinical assessment.

- **Laboratory test interferences**: Brilinta has been reported to cause false negative results in platelet functional tests, including the heparin-induced platelet aggregation (HIPA) assay, for patients with Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT). This is related to the inhibition of the P2Y12-receptor on the healthy donor platelets in the test by ticagrelor in the affected patient's serum/plasma. Information on concomitant treatment with Brilinta is required for the interpretation of HIT functional tests. Based on the mechanism of Brilinta interference, it is not expected to impact PF4 antibody testing for HIT.

### Extended dual antiplatelet therapy with ticagrelor 60 mg in patients with prior myocardial infarction: The design of ALETHEIA, a multi-country observational study [^115wtwxY]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Low credibility.

The study considers the 5000 person-years on treatment threshold as the minimum number required for sufficient precision in clinical outcome assessment. While this threshold is expected to be met, person-years on treatment is a function of both time on treatment and the number of patients. It is, therefore, influenced by the databases' available duration of longitudinal data as well as their national coverage.

To allow contextualization of patient characteristics, reference cohorts of non-ticagrelor patients will be described at a similar time point from their qualifying myocardial infarction (MI) as will be observed among the patients initiating ticagrelor 60 mg. In routine clinical practice, patients treated for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) may continue being prescribed a P2Y12 inhibitor more than 12 months after an MI, despite not being intended for extended antiplatelet treatment. To limit the inclusion of such patients in the non-ticagrelor P2Y12 inhibitor cohort, the categorization of patients into either reference cohort will be based on their treatment at a minimum of 15 months after their qualifying MI.

Exposure to non-ticagrelor P2Y12 inhibitors or lack of exposure to P2Y12 inhibitors may therefore be assessed after the index date for some patients, introducing a survival bias to patients in the reference cohort. Although the extent of this bias cannot be quantified a priori, the impact is likely minimal given the short maximum timeframe between the index date (≥ 12 months post-MI) and the time of treatment assessment (≥ 15 months post-MI). The primary analyses will be conducted using an on-treatment approach.

### Review of the ticagrelor trials evidence base [^116Ap4Zo]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Low credibility.

Ticagrelor is a platelet P2Y12 receptor inhibitor approved for use in patients with acute coronary syndromes, coronary artery disease, and low to moderate risk acute ischemic stroke or high-risk transient ischemic attack. Clinical trials have evaluated the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor on ischemic and bleeding outcomes for different indications and with varying treatment approaches. As a result, there is a large body of clinical evidence demonstrating different degrees of net clinical benefit compared with other platelet inhibitor drugs based on indication, patient characteristics, clinical presentation, treatment duration, and other factors.

We provide a review of the major trials of ticagrelor in the context of other randomized trials of clopidogrel and prasugrel to organize the volume of available information, elevate corroborating and conflicting data, and identify potential gaps as areas for further exploration of optimal antiplatelet treatment.

### Hospital-level variation in ticagrelor use in patients with acute coronary syndrome [^115aLRzp]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). High credibility.

Despite improved outcomes associated with ticagrelor compared with clopidogrel in acute coronary syndrome (ACS), many studies have demonstrated slow adoption of ticagrelor in the United States because of its increased cost. Less is known about how ticagrelor is adopted when there is no added cost consideration. Our objectives were to determine patterns of use of ticagrelor, hospital-level adoption of ticagrelor use, and factors associated with its use after ACS in a publicly funded healthcare system.

We conducted a population-based cohort study including patients (≥ 65 years) hospitalized with their first ACS from April 2014 to March 2018 in Ontario, Canada. We determined temporal trends in ticagrelor use and hospital-level adoption of its use post-ACS discharge. Using hierarchical regression models, we identified significant predictors of ticagrelor use. There were 23,962 patients with ACS (mean age 76.3 years, 59.7% men) hospitalized in 156 hospitals. Overall ticagrelor use increased from 32.6% in 2014/2015 to 51.8% in 2017/2018.

There was substantial variation in ticagrelor use post-ACS across hospitals, with hospital-specific prescribing rates ranging from 0% to 83.6%. Lower odds of ticagrelor use was associated with advanced age and the presence of comorbidities. Besides patient factors, being admitted to a rurally located hospital more than halved the odds of being prescribed ticagrelor (odds ratio [OR], 0.49; 95% CI, 0.32–0.77). Being managed by a cardiologist during the index ACS hospitalization was associated with higher odds of having ticagrelor prescribed.

### Concomitant use of warfarin and ticagrelor as an alternative to triple antithrombotic therapy after an acute coronary syndrome [^1176syLC]. Thrombosis Research (2015). Low credibility.

Treatment with warfarin in combination with clopidogrel has been shown to reduce the incidence of major bleeding compared to triple antithrombotic therapy (TT; warfarin, clopidogrel, and aspirin). However, uncertainties exist regarding the risk for thrombosis due to common poor-responsiveness to clopidogrel. Ticagrelor is a more potent platelet inhibitor, but data supporting the use of ticagrelor and warfarin (dual antithrombotic therapy, DT) is limited. This study, therefore, sought to evaluate the risk of bleeding and thrombosis associated with DT after an acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

- **Materials and methods**: We identified all ACS patients on DT upon discharge from Helsingborg Hospital and Skåne University Hospital in Malmö and Lund, Sweden, during 2013. Patients on DT were compared with historical controls discharged with TT. Major bleeding was defined in accordance with the HAS-BLED derivation study. Patients were retrospectively followed for three months.

- **Results**: In total, 107 DT patients were identified and compared with 159 controls on TT. Mean HAS-BLED bleeding risk scores and duration of treatment were similar between the groups (HAS-BLED 2.2 ± 0.8 vs. 2.2 ± 1.0 units, p = NS; duration 2.7 ± 0.8 vs. 2.5 ± 0.9 months, p = NS; DT vs. TT). The incidence of spontaneous major bleeding was similar between the groups, as was a composite of all thrombotic events, i.e. peripheral embolism, stroke/TIA, and acute coronary syndrome (bleeding 8/106 (7.5%) vs. 11/157 (7.0%), p = NS; thrombosis 5/106 (4.7%) vs. 5/157 (3.2%), p = NS; DT vs. TT).

- **Conclusions**: Rates of major bleeding and thrombotic events were similar between dual and triple antithrombotic therapy in post-ACS patients discharged from the studied hospitals. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings in larger patient populations.

	**Trial design and oversight**:
	- THALES was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, international, parallel-group trial conducted at 414 sites in 28 countries. The Executive Committee designed and oversaw the conduct and analysis of the trial in collaboration with the sponsor, AstraZeneca. Details of the study rationale, design, and methods have been described previously. After the trial start, given the results of the POINT trial (Platelet Oriented Inhibition in New TIA and Minor Ischemic Stroke) and CHANCE trial (Clopidogrel in High-Risk Patients With Acute Nondisabling Cerebrovascular Events), the study assumptions were adjusted to a lower hazard ratio requiring fewer primary endpoints and a smaller sample size.

The trial was approved by the relevant ethics committee for each participating site. Descriptions of the trial leadership, committees, and investigators are provided online with the full text of this article.

An independent Data Monitoring Committee regularly oversaw the safety of the patients and the integrity and conduct of the study based on patient accrual throughout the trial.

The trial analyses were done by the sponsor under the direction of the Executive Committee. The first author, who had full access to the data, wrote the first draft of the article.

### Ticagrelor monotherapy versus ticagrelor with aspirin in acute coronary syndrome patients with a high risk of ischemic events [^116Mgsh4]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2021). High credibility.

In this study, we evaluate the efficacy of ticagrelor monotherapy compared to the combination of ticagrelor with aspirin in patients with acute coronary syndrome who are at high risk for ischemic events. The patient population was carefully selected based on their clinical profiles and risk factors.

- **Study design**: A randomized controlled trial was conducted with participants receiving either ticagrelor alone or in combination with aspirin.
- **Outcomes measured**: The primary outcomes included the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and safety endpoints such as bleeding risks.

Results demonstrated that ticagrelor monotherapy was non-inferior to the combination therapy in preventing MACE. Furthermore, it significantly reduced bleeding complications, suggesting potential benefits in this high-risk group. Further analyses of subgroups reinforced the overall findings, indicating consistency across various patient demographics and clinical characteristics.

These findings offer valuable insights for clinicians considering antiplatelet therapy regimens in high-risk acute coronary syndrome patients.
