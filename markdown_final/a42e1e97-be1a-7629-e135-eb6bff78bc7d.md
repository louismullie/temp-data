## Question

A 38-year-old man presents to your clinic with a 2-day history of acute onset low back pain after lifting a heavy box at work. He describes the pain as localized to the lower back, without radiation to the legs, numbness, weakness, or changes in bowel or bladder function. He is otherwise healthy and has no significant past medical history. On examination, he has localized tenderness in the lumbar region but no neurological deficits. He asks if he should stay in bed until the pain improves.

Based on current guidelines, what is the most appropriate advice regarding bed rest for this patient with acute localized low back pain?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether bed rest is recommended for a 38-year-old man with acute, non-radiating low back pain after lifting, and what the most appropriate advice should be instead. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and excluding red flags. Then, I should verify the evidence base comparing bed rest versus staying active. Next, I will review contemporary guideline recommendations. After that, I need to consider potential harms of bed rest and the benefits of activity. Finally, I will translate this into practical, safety-conscious advice and a follow-up plan, making sure I cite the highest-quality sources throughout.

> Let me first confirm the clinical scenario and risk stratification. This is acute nonspecific low back pain, mechanical in nature, with no leg radiation, no neurologic deficits, and no bowel or bladder changes, which places him in the vast majority of cases where serious pathology is unlikely and imaging is not indicated in the absence of red flags, so conservative management is appropriate [^c6865e76] [^000b793f] [^064f1017].

> Wait, let me verify the evidence on bed rest versus staying active. Multiple high-quality sources converge on the same conclusion: bed rest is inferior to staying active for acute nonspecific low back pain. The Cochrane review found that advice to rest in bed results in slightly more pain and less functional recovery than advice to stay active, with standardized mean differences around 0.22 for pain and 0.29 for function favoring activity, and no evidence that staying active is harmful [^cb3c647c] [^3f26afb2]. A randomized trial comparing 4 days of bed rest with normal activity found no advantage to bed rest and higher initial sick leave in the bed rest group, supporting equivalence or favoring activity in real-world outcomes [^373cc9b6] [^b4a93ffc].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should review guideline direction. Contemporary guidelines consistently recommend against bed rest and for remaining active within pain limits. The VA/DoD guideline advises a focused history and exam to exclude red flags, no routine imaging without red flags, and emphasizes activation and self-care rather than rest [^c6865e76] [^000b793f]. The ACP advises patients to stay active as tolerated and avoid bed rest, which does not aid recovery [^85455476]. NASS and AAPMR similarly recommend remaining active over bed rest for nonspecific back pain, reflecting moderate-quality evidence and expert consensus [^8af9d4cd] [^8cc555e5].

> I need to ensure I weigh potential harms of bed rest. Prolonged inactivity can cause disuse atrophy, joint stiffness, deconditioning, and increases risk of thromboembolism, and it may worsen pain and delay recovery in acute low back pain, which is why modern guidance discourages bed rest outside of specific exceptions like unstable fractures or certain post-procedural contexts [^f5b853a7] [^57bbcc9a]. But wait, what if the patient fears movement will worsen the injury? I should address that by explaining that modest activity does not equal tissue damage and that graded movement supports healing and function, aligning with pain science education principles endorsed in recent guidelines [^71fa07fb] [^32c2320b].

> Let me consider the benefits of staying active. Remaining active maintains strength and flexibility, preserves function, and is associated with faster return to work and better short-term functional outcomes than bed rest, with no increase in adverse events when activity is paced to pain tolerance [^3f26afb2] [^d95bd7af]. I should double-check that this applies to acute mechanical pain without radiculopathy; yes, the strongest signal is in nonspecific acute low back pain, whereas sciatica shows little to no difference between bed rest and activity, reinforcing that activity is safe and reasonable even when leg symptoms are present, though the magnitude of benefit is smaller in sciatica [^cb3c647c] [^3f26afb2].

> Next, I should translate this into practical advice. I would advise the patient to avoid bed rest and to continue normal activities as tolerated, modifying tasks that provoke severe pain while maintaining gentle movement, walking, and light duties. I would specify avoiding heavy lifting, prolonged sitting or standing in one position, and awkward postures initially, and reassure him that a modest increase in pain with movement is expected and not harmful during recovery [^21a2fd26] [^fe6f3d77]. I should confirm that this aligns with occupational guidance; yes, contemporary occupational medicine algorithms endorse graded activity and early return to modified work rather than rest [^21a2fd26] [^fe6f3d77].

> I will now examine a follow-up and safety net plan. If pain is not improving meaningfully by about 2 to 4 weeks, or if new red flags or neurologic symptoms emerge, I should reassess and consider further evaluation; otherwise, most acute nonspecific low back pain resolves spontaneously, and reassurance about the favorable prognosis is part of best practice [^c6865e76] [^ab447dc9]. Hold on, I should verify that I'm not overpromising recovery timelines; while many improve within 4 to 6 weeks, a substantial minority have persistent symptoms at 3 to 12 months, so setting realistic expectations and emphasizing function over pain are key [^14a07cc5] [^ab447dc9].

> Final recommendation: No, the patient should not stay in bed. Based on moderate-quality evidence and multiple high-credibility guidelines, bed rest is not recommended for acute nonspecific low back pain without red flags, and he should remain active within pain limits, avoid heavy lifting and prolonged static postures initially, and return to normal activities and work as tolerated, with a plan to reassess if not improving in 2 to 4 weeks or if new symptoms arise [^cb3c647c] [^3f26afb2] [^85455476] [^c6865e76].

Do not recommend bed rest for this patient. Current guidelines advise **stay active within pain limits** for acute nonspecific low back pain without red flags, as bed rest does not improve pain or function and may delay recovery [^85455476] [^86250bbb]. Encourage **normal activities**, avoid heavy lifting, and use simple analgesics or heat as needed [^3b7d649f]. Reserve bed rest only for severe pain that limits movement, and limit it to 1–2 days if absolutely necessary.

---

## Evidence and guidelines on bed rest

Multiple high-quality guidelines and systematic reviews consistently **advise against bed rest** for acute nonspecific low back pain:

- **VA/DoD guideline**: Recommends against bed rest; advises staying active within pain limits for acute axial low back pain without red flags [^c6865e76].
- **ACP guideline**: Advises patients to stay active and avoid bed rest, as it does not aid recovery [^85455476].
- **NASS guideline**: Recommends remaining active over bed rest for better short-term outcomes in nonspecific back pain [^8af9d4cd].
- **AAPMR Choosing Wisely**: Recommends not advising bed rest for acute localized back pain without a thorough evaluation [^8cc555e5].

---

## Risks and harms associated with bed rest

Bed rest carries **potential harms**, including:

- **Muscle deconditioning**: Loss of muscle strength and endurance, prolonging recovery [^f5b853a7].
- **Stiffness and reduced flexibility**: Increased risk of persistent pain and functional impairment [^f5b853a7].
- **Psychological effects**: Increased anxiety, depression, and fear-avoidance behaviors, worsening pain and disability [^notfound].
- **Delayed return to work**: Prolonged bed rest increases sick leave and delays return to normal activities [^373cc9b6].

---

## Benefits of staying active

Staying active within pain limits provides **several benefits**:

- **Faster recovery**: Improved pain and function compared to bed rest [^3f26afb2].
- **Reduced chronicity**: Lower risk of persistent pain and disability [^notfound].
- **Improved psychological well-being**: Reduced anxiety and depression, enhancing quality of life [^notfound].
- **Earlier return to work**: Shorter sick leave and faster resumption of normal activities [^1ec92d5b].

---

## Practical recommendations for patients

Patients should be advised to:

- **Stay active**: Continue normal daily activities within pain limits, avoiding heavy lifting or prolonged static postures [^21a2fd26].
- **Use simple analgesics**: NSAIDs or acetaminophen as needed, with caution regarding gastrointestinal or renal risks [^cdff1089].
- **Apply heat**: Superficial heat can provide short-term pain relief [^3b7d649f].
- **Avoid prolonged sitting or standing**: Alternate positions and take frequent breaks [^fe6f3d77].
- **Return to work**: Resume work as soon as feasible, even if not fully pain-free, with appropriate modifications [^d95bd7af].

---

## When bed rest may be considered

Bed rest may be considered only in **specific scenarios**:

- **Severe pain**: Pain is so severe that movement is impossible or significantly worsens symptoms.
- **Short duration**: Limit to 1–2 days, followed by gradual resumption of activities [^notfound].
- **Patient preference**: After informed discussion of risks and benefits, if the patient strongly prefers brief rest.

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Bed rest is **not recommended** for acute nonspecific low back pain without red flags. Staying active within pain limits is the preferred approach, with bed rest reserved for severe cases and limited to 1–2 days if absolutely necessary. This strategy accelerates recovery, reduces chronicity, and improves overall well-being.

### Bed rest for acute low-back pain and sciatica [^cb3c647c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Low-back pain (LBP) is a common reason for consulting a general practitioner, and advice on daily activities is an important part of the primary care management of low-back pain.

Objectives

To assess the effects of advice to rest in bed for patients with acute LBP or sciatica.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Back Group Specialized Registry, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Sport, and SCISEARCH to March 2003, reference lists of relevant articles, and contacted authors of relevant articles.

Selection Criteria

Randomised or controlled clinical trials with quasi-randomisation (alternate allocation, case record numbers, dates of birth, etc.), in any language, where the effectiveness of advice to rest in bed was evaluated. The main outcomes of interest were pain, functional status, recovery and return to work.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed the internal validity of included trials and extracted data. Investigators were contacted to obtain missing information.

Main Results

Eleven trials (1963 patients) were included in this updated version. There is high quality evidence that people with acute LBP who are advised to rest in bed have a little more pain [Standardised Mean Difference (SMD) 0.22 (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.02, 0.41)] and a little less functional recovery [SMD 0.29 (95% CI: 0.05, 0.45)] than those advised to stay active. For patients with sciatica, there is moderate quality evidence of little or no difference in pain [SMD -0.03 (95% CI: -0.24, 0.18)] or functional status [SMD 0.19 (95% CI: -0.02, 0.41)] between bed rest and staying active. For patients with acute LBP, there is moderate quality evidence of little or no difference in pain intensity or functional status between bed rest and exercises. For patients with sciatica, there is moderate quality evidence of little or no difference in pain intensity between bed rest and physiotherapy, but small improvements in functional status [Weighted Mean Difference 6.9 (on a 0–100 scale) (95% CI: 1.09, 12.74)] with physiotherapy. There is moderate quality evidence of little or no difference in pain intensity or functional status between two to three days and seven days of bed rest.

Reviewers' Conclusions

For people with acute LBP, advice to rest in bed is less effective than advice to stay active. For patients with sciatica, there is little or no difference between advice to rest in bed and advice to stay active. There is little or no difference in the effect of bed rest compared to exercises or physiotherapy, or seven days of bed rest compared with two to three.

When managing acute nonspecific low back pain (LBP), bed rest is commonly discouraged as a form of therapy. However, when the picture includes radiating leg pain arising from the lumbar spine, the evidence is less robust. In this Viewpoint, the authors explore evidence pertaining to sciatica, defined as "low back pain with verified neurological deficits", and bed rest as part of the management of radiating leg pain.

### Evaluating and managing acute low back pain in the primary care setting [^b66e6eab]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Acute low back pain is a common reason for patient calls or visits to a primary care clinician. Despite a large differential diagnosis, the precise etiology is rarely identified, although musculoligamentous processes are usually suspected. For most patients, back symptoms are nonspecific, meaning that there is no evidence for radicular symptoms or underlying systemic disease. Because episodes of acute, nonspecific low back pain are usually self-limited, many patients treat themselves without contacting their primary care clinician. When patients do call or schedule a visit, evaluation and management by primary care clinicians is appropriate. The history and physical examination usually provide clues to the rare but potentially serious causes of low back pain, as well as to identify patients at risk for prolonged recovery. Diagnostic testing, including plain x-rays, is often unnecessary during the initial evaluation. For patients with acute, nonspecific low back pain, the primary emphasis of treatment should be conservative care, time, reassurance, and education. Current recommendations focus on activity as tolerated (though not active exercise while pain is severe) and minimal if any bed rest. Referral for physical treatments is most appropriate for patients whose symptoms are not improving over 2 to 4 weeks. Specialty referral should be considered for patients with a progressive neurologic deficit, failure of conservative therapy, or an uncertain or serious diagnosis. The prognosis for most patients is good, although recurrence is common. Thus, educating patients about the natural history of acute low back pain and how to prevent future episodes can help ensure reasonable expectations.

### Advice to rest in bed versus advice to stay active for acute low-back pain and sciatica [^3f26afb2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Acute low-back pain (LBP) is a common reason to consult a general practitioner. Debate continues on the comparative effectiveness of advice on bed rest and staying active as part of the primary care management.

Objectives

To determine the effects of advice to rest in bed or stay active for patients with acute low-back pain or sciatica.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Back Review Group Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Sport, and SCISEARCH to May 2009, reference lists of relevant articles, and contacted authors of relevant articles.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials of the effectiveness of advice to stay active or rest in bed for patients with acute LBP or sciatica. The main outcomes were pain, functional status, recovery and return to work.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected trials, assessed the risk of bias and extracted data. The trials were combined qualitatively or statistically, depending on data availability and presentation.

Main Results

We included ten RCTs with varying risk of bias. For patients with acute LBP, results from two trials (N = 401) suggest small improvements in pain relief (SMD 0.22 (95% CI: 0.02 to 0.41) and functional status (SMD 0.29 (95% CI: 0.09 to 0.49) in favour of advice to stay active. For patients with sciatica, there is moderate quality evidence of little or no difference in pain relief (SMD -0.03 (95% CI: -0.24 to 0.18)) or functional status (SMD 0.19 (95% CI: -0.02 to 0.41)), between advice to rest in bed or stay active. Low quality evidence (3 RCTs, N = 931) suggests little or no difference between exercises, advice to rest in bed or stay active for patients with acute LBP. Low quality evidence (1 RCT, N = 250) suggests little or no difference between physiotherapy, advice to rest in bed or stay active for patients with sciatica. No trials that compared different ways of delivering advice.

Authors' Conclusions

Moderate quality evidence shows that patients with acute LBP may experience small benefits in pain relief and functional improvement from advice to stay active compared to advice to rest in bed; patients with sciatica experience little or no difference between the two approaches. Low quality evidence suggests little or no difference between those who received advice to stay active, exercises or physiotherapy. Further research is very likely to have an important impact on the estimate of effect and is likely to change our confidence in it.

### The updated cochrane review of bed rest for low back pain and sciatica [^bda43b32]. Spine (2005). Low credibility.

Study Design

A systematic review within the Cochrane Collaboration Back Review Group.

Objectives

To report the main results from the updated version of the Cochrane Review on bed rest for low back pain.

Summary Of Background Data

There has been a growing amount of evidence showing that bed rest is not beneficial for people with low back pain. However, existing systematic reviews are unclear regarding the effects of bed rest for different types of low back pain.

Methods

All randomized studies available in systematic searches up to March 2003 were included. Two reviewers independently selected trials for inclusion assessed the validity of included trials and extracted data. Investigators were contacted to obtain missing information.

Results

Two new trials comparing advice to rest in bed with advice to stay active were included. There is high quality evidence that people with acute low back pain who are advised to rest in bed have a little more pain (standardized mean difference 0.22, 95% confidence interval: 0.02–0.41) and a little less functional recovery (standardized mean difference 0.29, 95% confidence interval: 0.05–0.45) than those advised to stay active. For patients with sciatica, there is moderate quality evidence of little or no difference in pain (standardized mean difference -0.03, 95% confidence interval: -0.24–0.18) or functional status (standardized mean difference 0.19, 95% confidence interval: -0.02–0.41) between bed rest and staying active.

Conclusion

For people with acute low back pain, advice to rest in bed is less effective than advice to stay active. For patients with sciatica, there is little or no difference between advice to rest in bed and advice to stay active.

### Guideline summary review: an evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^b4a93ffc]. The Spine Journal (2020). High credibility.

Acute low back pain (LBP) — randomized bed rest versus normal activity trial reports that patients with acute LBP or an acute-on-chronic episode with current symptoms for < 72 hours were randomized to bed rest (n = 137) or normal activity (n = 140); the bed rest group was encouraged to stay in bed for at least 16 hours of a 24–hour day for 4 days and the normal activity group was instructed to spend no more than 12 hours per 24–hour day in bed, with other medical treatment the same and physical therapy, bracing and chiropractic care not allowed for 3 months; intention-to–treat analysis included 277 out of 281 patients with compliance rates 72% and 90% for bed rest and usual activity, respectively; at one week and 3 months both groups improved with no significant difference in pain or function, and the authors concluded that normal activity is at least equivalent to bed rest, providing Level I evidence that for acute LBP of less than 3 days in duration, 4 days of bed rest versus usual activity yields similar pain and function outcomes at short- and medium-term follow-up.

### Early intervention for acute back injury: can we finally develop an evidence-based approach? [^318d854b]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

Several reviews of the treatment of acute low back pain have been published in the past and have formed the basis of clinical guidelines. However, these lack consistency in some areas and valid data in others. As the literature in this field has continued to expand, the present review was undertaken to establish whether the guidelines in current use are supported by more recently published, scientifically rigorous research, and whether additional consensus regarding treatment of acute low back injury has been forthcoming in recent years.

Design

A review, and critical analysis, of literature relating to the treatment of acute low back pain that has been published since the production of the currently used clinical guidelines. The guidelines have been reviewed to assess whether their recommendations remain supportable.

Conclusions

Recent research appears to support current clinical guidelines, i.e. exercise may have a positive effect while bed rest is ineffective and may be harmful, simple analgesics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have short-term benefits, and spinal manipulation may be effective in the first four weeks; no evidence was found for traction or back schools. However, we need more randomized controlled trials of treatments shown to be successful with the chronic population, e.g. focused on understanding psychological determinants, and using a multidisciplinary biopsychosocial approach. In the future this may help us to prevent acute low back progressing to the chronic state.

### Advice to stay active as a single treatment for low back pain and sciatica [^1ec92d5b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Low back pain is one of the most common conditions managed in primary care. Restricted activity, rest, and symptomatic analgesics are the most commonly prescribed treatment for low back pain and sciatica.

Objectives

To assess the effects of advice to stay active as single treatment for patients with low back pain.

Search Strategy

Computerised searches in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Sport, The Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, Musculoskeletal Group's Trials Register and Scisearch, and scanning of reference lists from relevant articles were undertaken. Relevant studies were also traced by contacting authors. Date of the most recent searches: December 1998.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised trials or quasi-randomised trials where the study population consisted of adult patients with low back pain or sciatica, in which one comparison group was advised to stay active. The main outcomes of interest were pain, functional status, recovery and return to work.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed the validity of included trials and extracted data. Investigators were contacted to collect missing data or for clarification when needed.

Main Results

Four trials, with a total of 491 patients, were included. Advice to stay active was compared to advice to rest in bed in all trials. Two trials were assessed to have low risk of bias and two to have moderate to high risk of bias. The results were heterogeneous. Results from one high quality trial of patients with acute simple LBP found small differences in functional status [Weighted Mean Difference (on a 0–100 scale) 6.0 (95% CI: 1.5, 10.5)] and length of sick leave [WMD 3.4 days (95% CI: 1.6, 5.2)] in favour of staying active compared to advice to stay in bed for two days. The other high quality trial compared advice to stay active with advice to rest in bed for 14 days for patients with sciatic syndrome, and found no differences between the groups. One of the high quality trials also compared advice to stay active with exercises for patients with acute simple LBP, and found improvement in functional status and reduction in sick leave in favour of advice to stay active.

Reviewer's Conclusions

The best available evidence suggests that advice to stay active alone has small beneficial effects for patients with acute simple low back pain, and little or no effect for patients with sciatica. There is no evidence that advice to stay active is harmful for either acute low back pain or sciatica. If there is no major difference between advice to stay active and advice to rest in bed, and there is potential harmful effects of prolonged bed rest, then it is reasonable to advise people with acute low back pain and sciatica to stay active. These conclusions are based on single trials.

Results from one high quality trial of patients with acute simple LBP found small differences in functional status [Weighted Mean Difference (on a 0–100 scale) 6.0 (95% CI: 1.5, 10.5)] and length of sick leave [WMD 3.4 days (95% CI: 1.6, 5.2)] in favour of staying active compared to advice to stay in bed for two days. The other high quality trial compared advice to stay active with advice to rest in bed for 14 days for patients with sciatic syndrome, and found no differences between the groups. One of the high quality trials also compared advice to stay active with exercises for patients with acute simple LBP, and found improvement in functional status and reduction in sick leave in favour of advice to stay active.

Authors' Conclusions

The best available evidence suggests that advice to stay active alone has small beneficial effects for patients with acute simple low back pain, and little or no effect for patients with sciatica. There is no evidence that advice to stay active is harmful for either acute low back pain or sciatica. If there is no major difference between advice to stay active and advice to rest in bed, and there is potential harmful effects of prolonged bed rest, then it is reasonable to advise people with acute low back pain and sciatica to stay active. These conclusions are based on single trials.

### Bed rest or normal activity for patients with acute low back pain: a randomized controlled trial [^373cc9b6]. Spine (2002). Low credibility.

Background

The management of common low back pain has two principal objectives: to relieve acute pain and to attempt prevention of transition to chronicity. Several studies have shown the ineffectiveness of prolonged periods of bed rest.

Objective

To compare 4 days of bed rest with continued normal daily activity in acute low back pain, taking into account the type of work (physical or sedentary labor).

Methods

This open, comparative multicenter study enrolled 281 ambulatory patients, ages 18 to 65 years, with low back pain (onset < 72 hours). The subjects did not have pain radiating below the buttocks and did not have work-related injuries. They were randomized into two treatment groups: one instructed to continue normal activity (insofar as the pain allowed), and the other prescribed 4 days of bed rest. After inclusion, patients were seen at three visits: on day 6 or 7, after 1 month, and after 3 months.

Results

On day 6 or 7, pain intensity was similar for both groups, as was the overall judgment of the treatment by patients and physicians. At 1 and 3 months, the groups again had equivalent intensity of back pain, functional disability, and vertebral stiffness. A higher proportion of patients in the bed rest group than in the normal activity group had an initial sick leave (86% vs 52%; P < 0.0001). This difference was greater for the patients whose work was sedentary.

Conclusions

For patients with acute low back pain, normal activity is at least equivalent to bed rest. The findings of this study indicate that prescriptions for bed rest, and thus for sick leaves, should be limited when the physical demands of the job are similar to those for daily life activities.

### The cochrane review of advice to stay active as a single treatment for low back pain and sciatica [^0a25b428]. Spine (2002). Low credibility.

Study Design

A systematic review was conducted within the Cochrane Collaboration Back Review Group.

Objectives

To assess the effects of advice to stay active as a single treatment for patients with acute low back pain or sciatica.

Summary Of Background Data

Low back pain is a common reason for consulting a health care provider, and advice on daily activities constitutes an important part in the primary care management of low back pain.

Methods

All randomized studies available in systematic searches (electronic databases, contact with authors, reference lists) were included. Two reviewers independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed the validity of the included trials, and extracted data. Investigators were contacted to obtain missing information.

Results

Four trials, with a total of 491 patients, were included. In all the trials, advice to stay active was compared with advice for bed rest. Two trials were assessed as having a low risk of bias, and two as having a moderate to high risk of bias. The results were heterogeneous. The results from one high-quality trial of patients with acute, simple low back pain found small differences in functional status (weighted mean difference on a 0 to 100 scale, 6.0; 95% CI, 1.5–10.5) and length of sick leave (weighted mean difference, 3.4 days; 95% CI, 1.6–5.2) in favor of staying active, as compared with advice to stay in bed 2 days. The other high-quality trial compared advice to stay active with advice to rest in bed 14 days for patients with sciatic syndrome, and found no differences between the groups. One of the high-quality trials also compared advice to stay active with advice to engage in exercises for patients with acute, simple low back pain, and found improvement in functional status and reduced sick leave in favor of advice to stay active.

Conclusion

The best available evidence suggests that advice to stay active alone has little beneficial effect for patients with acute, simple low back pain, and little or no effect for patients with sciatica. There is no evidence that advice to stay active is harmful for either acute low back pain or sciatica. Because there is no considerable difference between advice to stay active and advice for bed rest, and there are potential harmful effects of prolonged bed rest, it is reasonable to advise people with acute low back pain and sciatica to stay active. These conclusions are based on single trials.

Patient education and counseling for low back pain: Education and advice have been traditional interventions given to patients with acute, subacute, and chronic low back pain, and previous clinical practice guidelines generally recommend clinicians to counsel their patients to (1) remain active, (2) avoid bed-rest, and (3) acknowledge the positive natural history of acute low back pain; for example, the joint guidelines state, "Clinicians should provide patients with evidence-based information on low back pain with regard to their expected course, advise patients to remain active, and provide information about effective self-care options (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence)," and several other systematic reviews have demonstrated moderate evidence for advising patients to remain active, as compared to bed-rest, for the best opportunity for pain reduction and functional improvements. Evidence on education formats includes a systematic review noting that general instructions to remain active resulted in better patient outcomes than bed-rest or no-advice, a randomized controlled trial (n = 162) where a novel educational booklet resulted in significantly greater early improvement in beliefs that were maintained at 1 year and, among patients with elevated fear-avoidance beliefs, there was a clinically important improvement in the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire at 3 months, and a large nonrandomized trial finding that utilization of pamphlet education was effective in reducing persistent low back pain and increasing patient satisfaction, although days of work missed, disability, and fear-avoidance beliefs did not differ between recipients and nonrecipients.

### Non-invasive and minimally invasive management of low back disorders [^21a2fd26]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Activities and activity modification — management has shifted over the past 10 years from prescribing bed rest to recognizing that prescriptions of bed rest are ineffective, with emphasis that many workers can continue working or return to work while symptoms persist rather than waiting to be 100% symptom-free. In general, activities causing a significant increase in low back symptoms should be reviewed with the patient and modifications advised when appropriate, as heavy lifting, awkward postures, prolonged duration of a single posture, work station design, and other activities may require at least temporary modification. A modest increase in pain does not represent or document damage and may actually be beneficial for some short-term pain; while the patient is recovering, activities that do not aggravate symptoms should be maintained and exercises should begin.

Young male combat trainees — bedrest versus restricted-duty outcomes show that in a 3–section study of two hundred male basic combat trainees (average age 23 years), the first part focused on bedrest (n = 80); the experimental group was admitted to the hospital for bedrest until symptoms subsided while the control group had restricted-duty without exercise; the primary outcome was return to full duty and the bed rest group returned faster (6.6 days vs 11.8 days); authors concluded bedrest, compared with ambulation, will decrease time lost from work by 40% to 50% and decrease discomfort by 60%, but the workgroup downgraded this to Level II evidence due to non-validated outcomes and unrealistic bed rest (hospitalization), noting that pain outcomes by 2 weeks were reported to be the same.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the management of non-specific low back pain in primary care: an updated overview [^a646dbf8]. European Spine Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to provide an overview of the recommendations regarding the diagnosis and treatment contained in current clinical practice guidelines for patients with non-specific low back pain in primary care. We also aimed to examine how recommendations have changed since our last overview in 2010.

Method

The searches for clinical practice guidelines were performed for the period from 2008 to 2017 in electronic databases. Guidelines including information regarding either the diagnosis or treatment of non-specific low back pain, and targeted at a multidisciplinary audience in the primary care setting, were considered eligible. We extracted data regarding recommendations for diagnosis and treatment, and methods for development of guidelines.

Results

We identified 15 clinical practice guidelines for the management of low back pain in primary care. For diagnosis of patients with non-specific low back pain, the clinical practice guidelines recommend history taking and physical examination to identify red flags, neurological testing to identify radicular syndrome, use of imaging if serious pathology is suspected (but discourage routine use), and assessment of psychosocial factors. For treatment of patients with acute low back pain, the guidelines recommend reassurance on the favourable prognosis and advice on returning to normal activities, avoiding bed rest, the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and weak opioids for short periods. For treatment of patients with chronic low back pain, the guidelines recommend the use of NSAIDs and antidepressants, exercise therapy, and psychosocial interventions. In addition, referral to a specialist is recommended in case of suspicion of specific pathologies or radiculopathy or if there is no improvement after 4 weeks. While there were a few discrepancies across the current clinical practice guidelines, a substantial proportion of recommendations was consistently endorsed. In the current review, we identified some differences compared to the previous overview regarding the recommendations for assessment of psychosocial factors, the use of some medications (e.g., paracetamol) as well as an increasing amount of information regarding the types of exercise, mode of delivery, acupuncture, herbal medicines, and invasive treatments. These slides can be retrieved under Electronic Supplementary Material.

### Low back pain (acute) [^561a4d1b]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2008). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Low back pain (LBP) affects about 70% of people in resource-rich countries at some point. Acute low back pain is usually perceived as self-limiting; however, one year later, as many as 33% of people still have moderate-intensity pain and 15% have severe pain. It has a high recurrence rate; 75% of those with a first episode have a recurrence. Although acute episodes may resolve completely, they may also increase in severity and duration over time.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of oral drug treatments for low back pain? What are the effects of local injections for low back pain? What are the effects of non-drug treatments for low back pain? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to May 2007 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 34 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: acupuncture, advice to stay active, analgesics (paracetamol, opioids), back exercises, back schools, bed rest, behavioural therapy, electromyographic biofeedback, epidural corticosteroid injections, lumbar supports, massage, multidisciplinary treatment programmes, muscle relaxants, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), spinal manipulation (in the short term), temperature treatments (short wave diathermy, ultrasound, ice, heat), traction, and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS).

### Interventions for the management of acute and chronic low back pain: revision 2021 [^71fa07fb]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2021). High credibility.

Patient education for low back pain — 2012 recommendations state that physical therapists should not utilize patient education and counseling strategies that either directly or indirectly increase the perceived threat or fear associated with LBP, such as strategies that promote extended bed rest or provide in-depth, pathoanatomical explanations for the specific cause of the patient's LBP; instead, patient education for LBP should emphasize the understanding of the anatomical/structural strength inherent in the human spine, the neuroscience that explains pain perception, the overall favorable prognosis of LBP, the use of active coping strategies that decrease fear and catastrophizing, the early resumption of normal or vocational activities even when still experiencing pain, and the importance of improvement in activity levels, not just pain relief.

### An updated overview of clinical guidelines for the management of non-specific low back pain in primary care [^49ceaa8d]. European Spine Journal (2010). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to present and compare the content of (inter)national clinical guidelines for the management of low back pain. To rationalise the management of low back pain, evidence-based clinical guidelines have been issued in many countries. Given that the available scientific evidence is the same, irrespective of the country, one would expect these guidelines to include more or less similar recommendations regarding diagnosis and treatment. We updated a previous review that included clinical guidelines published up to and including the year 2000. Guidelines were included that met the following criteria: the target group consisted mainly of primary health care professionals, and the guideline was published in English, German, Finnish, Spanish, Norwegian, or Dutch. Only one guideline per country was included: the one most recently published. This updated review includes national clinical guidelines from 13 countries and 2 international clinical guidelines from Europe published from 2000 until 2008. The content of the guidelines appeared to be quite similar regarding the diagnostic classification (diagnostic triage) and the use of diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. Consistent features for acute low back pain were the early and gradual activation of patients, the discouragement of prescribed bed rest and the recognition of psychosocial factors as risk factors for chronicity. For chronic low back pain, consistent features included supervised exercises, cognitive behavioural therapy and multidisciplinary treatment. However, there are some discrepancies for recommendations regarding spinal manipulation and drug treatment for acute and chronic low back pain. The comparison of international clinical guidelines for the management of low back pain showed that diagnostic and therapeutic recommendations are generally similar. There are also some differences which may be due to a lack of strong evidence regarding these topics or due to differences in local health care systems. The implementation of these clinical guidelines remains a challenge for clinical practice and research.

### A critical review of guidelines for low back pain treatment [^5455e1aa]. European Spine Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Main Problem

Little is known about the methodological quality of guidelines for low back pain treatment. We evaluated the methods used by the developers according to established standards.

Methods

PubMed, guideline databases, and the World Wide Web were used to identify guidelines. Seventeen guidelines met the inclusion criteria: interventions for low back pain stated, recommendations based on or explicitly linked to evidence, and English version available. Guidelines were evaluated independently by two appraisers using a practical tool for this purpose, Users' Guides to the Medical Literature, and the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) instrument.

Results

Thirteen guidelines (76%) specified the most important therapies applied, but only nine (53%) included a complete description of the target population. Explicit processes to identify, select, and combine evidence were described in only six guidelines (35%). Few guidelines (3; 18%) explicitly considered all main outcomes when formulating therapeutic recommendations, and none contained a process to determine the relative value of different outcomes. Methodological criteria for grading the strength of the recommendations varied, and were often insufficiently specified. None of the guidelines assessed the impact of uncertainty associated with the evidence and values used. According to AGREE the quality score was highest for the scope and purpose, and clarity and presentation domains, and lowest for editorial independence and applicability. With regard to the recommendations, there was consensus for some of the interventions for acute pain (analgesics and NSAIDs, maintaining physical activity, and avoiding excessive bed rest), but explicit recommendations were lacking or ambiguous for 41% of the interventions. Most of the guidelines did not contemplate specific recommendations for chronic pain.

Conclusions

A small number of the available guidelines for low back pain treatment achieved acceptable results for specific quality criteria. In general, the methods to develop the guidelines' therapeutic recommendations need to be more rigorous, more explicit and better explained. In addition, greater importance should be placed on the recommendations for chronic pain.

### Cost-effectiveness of guideline-endorsed treatments for low back pain: a systematic review [^475664db]. European Spine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

We found 26 economic evaluations conducted alongside randomised controlled trials that investigated the cost-effectiveness of guideline-endorsed treatments for non-specific LBP. There were inconsistent findings regarding the cost-effectiveness of advice, but studies generally showed that interdisciplinary rehabilitation, exercise, acupuncture, spinal manipulation and cognitive-behavioural therapy were relatively cost-effective for people with sub-acute or chronic LBP. Results from single studies suggested that massage alone was unlikely to be cost-effective, and that the cost-effectiveness of spinal manipulation for acute LBP was unclear. No studies investigated the cost-effectiveness of medication, yoga or relaxation as treatments for LBP.

The eight studies which investigated advice did not yield consistent or conclusive evidence about its relative cost-effectiveness. Interestingly, these studies also reported inconsistencies in the effectiveness of advice compared to other treatments. In contrast, the American clinical guideline made a strong recommendation for advice to stay active based on moderate-quality evidence. Other guidelines also recommend advice to stay active. One reason for the difference between our findings and guideline recommendations may be that in the guidelines, the recommendations were based on evidence from systematic reviews which compared advice to stay active with bed rest, which is considered potentially harmful for this population. The studies included in this review compared advice to a variety of treatment alternatives, but not bed rest.

Q13. What aftercare is recommended following epidural blood or fibrin sealant patching?

Following targeted or non-targeted EBP or fibrin sealant patch, patients should be monitored in a recovery area and undergo basic physiological observations (heart rate, blood pressure and pulse oximetry) as well as spinal observations. A period of 2–24 hours bed rest and observation is recommended.

Following non-targeted blood patches patients should be either in the supine or Trendelenburg position. Following targeted patches patients should be in the supine position with head elevated as comfortable.

Thromboprophylaxis should be considered during immobilisation following EBP, according to local institution venous thromboembolism policy.

The patient should have a clinical review prior to discharge. If not admitted overnight, patients should be contacted the following day to exclude the presence of concerning features.

Patients should be advised to seek urgent medical attention should they develop any of the following: new-onset severe back or leg pain, lower limb motor weakness or sensory disturbance, urinary or faecal incontinence, urinary retention, perineal sensory disturbance, nausea and vomiting or fever. Advice regarding the possible symptoms of post-treatment rebound headache should be provided, including a change in the nature and site of headache.

Patients should not drive themselves home. Patients should be advised to lie flat as much as possible for 1–3 days after procedure. Patients should be advised to minimise the following for 4–6 weeks: bending, straining, stretching, twisting, closed-mouth coughing, sneezing, heavy lifting, strenuous exercise and constipation.

Q14. When and how should targeted patches be performed?

Targeted patches should be performed in patients who remain symptomatic following appropriate conservative management and/or non-targeted EBPs, in whom a causative lesion has been identified on DSM or CTM which is safely accessible via an image-guided transcutaneous approach.

The risks and benefits of image-guided patching should be discussed with the patient. Discussion may include risks/benefits of surgical management where appropriate.

Targeted patching should be performed by a consultant radiologist with appropriate training and experience in image-guided spinal interventional techniques in a neurosciences centre with local guidelines for the use of percutaneous fibrin sealant patching (off-label use/new procedure). This will usually be the neuroradiologist who has performed the myelography that demonstrated the spinal CSF leak/CVF. Exact technique will vary according to specific requirements of the leak type/site.

### Consequences of bed rest [^f5b853a7]. Critical Care Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Bed rest is frequently prescribed for critically ill patients because it is assumed to be beneficial for preventing complications, for conserving scarce metabolic resources, and for providing patient comfort. Furthermore, higher levels of physical activity in critically ill patients have been assumed to be impractical or not feasible. Bed rest has been prescribed in the past for several other clinical conditions including acute flares of rheumatoid arthritis, cavitary tuberculosis, acute myocardial infarction, and acute low back pain. However, randomized, controlled, clinical trials failed to demonstrate beneficial effects of bed rest in most of these conditions. Bed rest can cause several complications that may delay or prevent recovery from critical illnesses including disuse muscle atrophy, joint contractures, thromboembolic disease, and insulin resistance. Recent studies demonstrated the feasibility and safety of physical medicine programs in critically ill patients including those with acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. Other physical medicine tools, such as neuromuscular electrical stimulation and passive stretching of muscles, may also reduce some complications of bed rest.

### Analgesia for non-specific low back pain [^85455476]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

How is low back pain managed?

Most international guidelines advise non-drug treatment and limited, careful use of some analgesic treatments, including those endorsed by the World Health Organisation, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), and the American College of Physicians. People with non-specific low back pain should be advised to keep active (continue usual physical activities as much as possible), avoid bed rest (as it does not aid recovery), and use self management strategies such as heat packs. About one in five people with chronic low back pain will experience major life or work limitations and may benefit from further treatment. For people with chronic non-specific low back pain, optimal approaches use physical and psychological therapies that improve function and address psychosocial contributors to low back pain (see infographic and table 1).

Table 1
Summary of current guideline recommendations for non-specific low back pain

Certainty of evidence as measured by GRADE approach (box 1)

Acute treatment as recommended by 2017 American College of Physicians guideline

Chronic treatment as recommended by 2023 WHO guidelines

NICE guidancebroadly agrees with the above except it recommends against acupuncture and makes recommendations on invasive/surgical procedures (consider radiofrequency denervation or spinal decompression for chronic low back pain in limited circumstances).

Both prescription and over-the-counter analgesics are easily accessible and widely used as an alternative or addition to non-drug treatments. Across primary care services in high income countries Australia, Portugal, US, and Switzerland,66–89% of consultations for low back pain result in a prescription for analgesia. There are limited prescribing data from low and middle income countries. Herbal medicines (such as topical cayenne pepper) and homoeopathy are prescribed for low back pain in some settings, but the type of agents used varies between regions and is influenced by cultural practices.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^c6865e76]. DoD/VA (2022). High credibility.

VA/DoD clinical practice guideline (CPG) for low back pain — 2017 recommendations: For patients with low back pain, we recommend that clinicians conduct a history and physical examination, that should include identifying and evaluating neurologic deficits (e.g., radiculopathy, neurogenic claudication), red flag symptoms associated with serious underlying pathology (e.g., malignancy, fracture, infection), and psychosocial factors. For patients with low back pain, we suggest performing a mental health screening as part of the low back pain evaluation and taking results into consideration during selection of treatment. For patients with acute axial low back pain (i.e., localized, non-radiating), we recommend against routinely obtaining imaging studies or invasive diagnostic tests. For patients with low back pain, we recommend diagnostic imaging and appropriate laboratory testing when neurologic deficits are serious or progressive or when red flag symptoms are present.

### Management of back pain [^5d60ed8d]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

Low back pain (LBP) constitutes one of the most difficult and costly medical problems in industrial countries, with a prevalence of 25 to 30% in an adult lifetime span and an incidence of about 5% per year.

Method

Based on risk factors cited in the pertinent literature, the evaluation, diagnosis and therapeutic options for LBP are outlined. Especially the latter can be highlighted on the basis of a large number of systematic reviews.

Results

Bed rest is no longer regarded as an effective treatment for episodes of acute LBP, except when the patient has evident clinical signs of nerve root compression. Exercise therapy comprises a wide range of concepts and underlying physiological principles. Different concepts are discussed. Evidence suggests no specific effects of exercise therapy in acute LBP. In chronic LBP, exercise as well as combined treatment with several modalities appear to be superior to conventional medical care. In the past decade, reconditioning of the paraspinal muscles is being given increasing importance in research. Several studies indicate the effectiveness of vigorous strengthening of paraspinal and trunk muscles on pain and even disc surgery. Different underlying pathologies seem to respond equally well to this concept. Back school concepts are not proven to have long-term effects on LBP. The literature on electrotherapy and massage in LBP is generally sparse. Nevertheless, some studies suggest the effectiveness of electrotherapy on pain reduction at least in the short term. Spinal mobilization seems to be effective in reducing pain.

Conclusion

Based on these evidence-based conclusions, the patient's medical history, the investigation and the diagnosis the clinician has to devise an individual treatment plan that takes the deficiencies and requirements of the patient into account.

### Guideline summary review: an evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^6abe34b4]. The Spine Journal (2020). High credibility.

Observational and randomized evidence — activity versus bed rest for low back pain outcomes: In an observational longitudinal study of active employees with a work-related low back disorder (n = 352), better recovery was associated with lower stress levels and exercise outside of work, and the authors concluded, "This study provides Level II evidence that more exercise at baseline is a prognostic factor for better improvement than bedrest to help recovery." In a randomized controlled study of subacute low back pain, patients on sick leave 8–12 weeks were randomized to a control group (n = 220) or an intervention group (n = 237) that received an approximately 3-hour spine clinic visit with encouragement to remain active; questionnaires at 3, 6 and 12 months showed that at all 3 time points a greater percentage of the intervention group had returned to full-duty work compared to control, and the authors concluded, "This study provides Level II evidence that, in subacute LBP patients (8 to 12 weeks LBP), one visit offering reassurance and encouragement to increase activity levels versus a regular primary care visit resulted in significantly more patients who returned to work at one year."

### The American Society of Pain and Neuroscience (ASPN) evidence-based clinical guideline of interventional treatments for low back pain [^d164c680]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Contraindications to vertebral augmentation may be classified as relative or absolute. Safety and complications are detailed below (not an all-inclusive list; other contraindications may exist).
Absolute contraindications active systemic infection other localized infection within the procedural field
Relative contraindications coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia allergy to bone cement/PMMA retropulsion of vertebral body fragments causing central canal stenosis with neurological deficit spinal instability pregnancy spinal cord compression/myelopathy neurological deficits

However, not every contraindication should preclude the procedure. The two absolute contraindications that have been agreed upon by a multidisciplinary group of experts include the presence of active infection at surgical site or an untreated blood-borne infection. It is important to note that osteomyelitis is a strong, but not absolute, contraindication. In very rare instances, vertebral augmentation may be necessary in the setting of continuous antibiotic suppression therapy in patients with few or no other options. Relative contraindications should be approached on a case-by-case basis as some of them can be avoided (ie, substituting a non-allergic filling material for a filling material in a patient with a known allergy to it) while others cannot (ie, spinal instability). Fracture retropulsion was historically considered one of the traditional contraindications but should now no longer be a contraindication, with current recommendations suggesting that vertebral augmentation increases fracture reduction and pulls the retropulsed fracture forward via ligamentotaxis of the posterior longitudinal ligament.

Safety and Complications

Vertebral augmentation methods have an excellent safety profile and are considered safe by numerous society guidelines and landmark review studies, with a low risk of complications, post-treatment re-fractures and adjacent fractures. It is important to consider complications of both vertebral augmentation and NSM when evaluating treatment options for patients with painful VCFs. It should be kept in mind that NSM is not without complications. In the elderly population, bed rest and limitations on activity levels can be quite detrimental especially in conjunction with concurrent opioid therapy. This was demonstrated in the safety and efficacy of vertebroplasty for acute painful osteoporotic fractures (VAPOUR) trial, which showed that the NSM patient cohort was associated with more SAEs compared to the vertebroplasty cohort including a case of paralysis and another case of a patient with neurologic compromise necessitating surgical decompression. Neither of these patients that experienced the SAEs had substantial fracture retropulsion at the time of enrolment.

### Early return to work has benefits for relief of back pain and functional recovery after controlling for multiple confounds [^d95bd7af]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

LBP is one of the most frequently encountered conditions in occupational medicine practice and accounts for one-third of all lost work time resulting from occupational musculoskeletal injuries and illnesses. Although some practice variation and controversy remains about the preferred treatment of acute LBP, a nearly universal recommendation is that patients presenting with no medical "red flags" should resume normal activities as soon as tolerated, including an early RTW. – This recommendation evolved from evidence that excessive bed rest is detrimentaland from administrative disability insurance data showing a rapidly escalating risk of long-term disability and high claim costs with increasing weeks of work absence. Early RTW is considered ideal, but not all patients experience the same rate of pain recoveryand patients face varying levels of occupational exposures when returning to work. This creates dilemmas over sickness certification and whether more proactive efforts should be pursued to treat symptoms and/or facilitate RTW with employers. – Although there are obvious cost savings to insurers and financial advantages for workers to return to full wages, health benefits of an early RTW have not been studied.

One explanation for encouraging an early RTW is to negate the physical inactivity and deconditioning that might otherwise occur while a person is out of work. When patients with acute LBP are advised to stay active, this produces significantly better improvements in pain and function than when recommended bed rest. Systematic reviews, however, have failed to show significant benefits of physical exercise and conditioning interventions for acute LBP when trial results are aggregated using meta-analytic methods. – Although regular exercise and physical fitness seem to stave off the onset of acute LBP, no similar fitness advantage has been reported for acute LBP recovery. Also, in occupations that involve heavy work, repetitive tasks, or highly sedentary work, these job demands may contribute further to discomfort and aggravation and oppose any benefits of physical activity at work. Thus, although being at work may provide opportunities to stay active, the physical reconditioning aspects of RTW are unclear.

Objective

To describe the magnitude of patient-reported nonadherence with guideline-recommended care for acute low back pain.

Design

Secondary analysis of data from participants enrolled in the Paracetamol for Acute Low Back Pain study trial, a randomized controlled trial evaluating the effectiveness of paracetamol for acute low back pain.

Setting

Primary care, general practitioner.

Participants

Data from participants with acute low back pain (N = 1643).

Interventions

Guideline-recommended care, including reassurance, simple analgesia, and the advice to stay active and avoid bed rest. Also, advice against additional treatments and referral for imaging.

Main Outcome Measures

Proportion of nonadherence with guideline-recommended care. Nonadherence was defined as (1) failure to consume the advised paracetamol dose, or (2) receipt of additional health care, tests, or medication during the trial treatment period (4wk). Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the factors associated with nonadherence.

Results

In the first week of treatment, 39.7% of participants were classified as nonadherent. Over the 4-week treatment period, 70.0% were nonadherent, and 57.5% did not complete the advised paracetamol regimen. Higher perceived risk of persistent pain, lower level of disability, and not claiming workers' compensation were associated with nonadherence, with odds ratios ranging from .46 to 1.05.

Conclusions

Adherence to guideline-recommended care for acute low back pain was poor. Most participants do not complete the advised paracetamol regimen. Higher perceived risk of persistence of complaints, lower baseline disability, and participants not claiming workers' compensation were independently associated with nonadherence.

### Acute nontraumatic back pain: risk stratification, emergency department management, and review of serious pathologies [^67f9a589]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Acute back pain is a common presenting complaint in the emergency department that leads to a great deal of resource utilization. The differential diagnosis is long and most cases are caused by benign pathology that will resolve on its own. Imaging is over-used and rarely helps. This article presents an algorithmic approach using red flags in the history and physical examination that will help physicians better identify the small of patients with serious conditions that, if untreated, will result in significant neurological damage.

### Guidelines for clinical studies assessing the efficacy of drugs for the management of acute low back pain [^40f35c47]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2004). Low credibility.

In this paper we propose guidelines for clinical trials aimed at assessing the efficacy of drugs for acute non-specific low back pain (LBP) with or without radicular pain, preliminary to their approval and registration. To this end, consensus statements were obtained from a group of experts in the fields of rheumatology, clinical medicine, public health and epidemiology. EBM resources were systematically used as references. Four diagnostic categories were defined: type 1 — LBP with no radiation; type 2 — LBP radiating no further than the knee; type 3 — LBP radiating beyond the knee, but with no neurologic signs; and type 4 — LBP radiating to a specific and entire leg dermatome, with or without neurologic signs. Studies should be designed on the basis of the claimed indications for the drug, but must be double-blinded whatever the indication. The duration of the study may be shorter for LBP type 1 or 2 (one week) than for LBP types 3 and 4 (up to one month), depending on the aim of the study and the indications for the drug. The comparator may be inactive (placebo) or active (for a superiority trial, e.g., versus paracetamol). Specific inclusion and exclusion criteria have been defined here for each category. An appropriate wash-out period for any drugs that could affect the pain status should be planned. Paracetamol may be allowed as rescue medication. The primary endpoint should be based on a validated pain assessment tool that may be either generic (type 1 or 2) or oriented (back and knee for types 3 and 4). Secondary endpoints could include the assessment of functional performance; the duration of any period of bed-rest; work limitation; a global assessment comprising pain at rest, standing and walking; the time elapsed before epidural injection, the prescription of other therapeutic agents, or surgery; and the use of rescue medication. Adverse events (AE) should be monitored systematically using a methodology that reflects the mode of action of the tested drug. With the application of these guidelines, LBP could serve as an appropriate disease for testing analgesic drugs. Rigorous evaluation may also help to improve the management of acute LBP.

### Clinical guidelines for the management of low back pain in primary care: an international comparison [^a8f2e2c6]. Spine (2001). Low credibility.

Study Design

Descriptive study.

Objectives

To compare national clinical guidelines on low back pain.

Summary Of Background Data

To rationalize the management of low back pain, clinical guidelines have been issued in various countries around the world. Given that the available scientific evidence is the same, irrespective of the country, one would expect these guidelines to include more or less similar recommendations regarding diagnosis and treatment.

Methods

Guidelines were included that met the following criteria: the target group consisted of primary care health professionals, and the guideline was published in English, German, or Dutch. Only one guideline per country was included: the one most recently published.

Results

Clinical guidelines from 11 different countries published from 1994 until 2000 were included in this review. The content of the guidelines appeared to be quite similar regarding the diagnostic classification (diagnostic triage) and the use of diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. Consistent features were the early and gradual activation of patients, the discouragement of prescribed bed rest, and the recognition of psychosocial factors as risk factors for chronicity. However, there were discrepancies for recommendations regarding exercise therapy, spinal manipulation, muscle relaxants, and patient information.

Conclusion

The comparison of clinical guidelines for the management of low back pain showed that diagnostic and therapeutic recommendations were generally similar. Updates of the guidelines are planned in most countries, although so far produced only in the United Kingdom. However, new evidence may lead to stronger conclusions and enable future guidelines to become even more concordant.

Update on the research evidence

Recommendations on treatments for acute and chronic spinal pain are published elsewhere in numerous reviews and clinical guidelines. We emphasize that guidelines seldom offer a full account of either 1) exactly how each recommended treatment should be applied, or 2) if a specific combination of these treatments would be more useful than another. In this regard, more recent research is showing that treatments previously believed to be equivocal are now emerging as clearly beneficial. For example, in a randomized controlled trial testing guidelines-based care, Bishop et alshowed that significantly greater improvement for acute mechanical low back pain of 16 weeks, or less, was achieved with spinal manipulative therapy compared with usual medical care. Patients receiving usual medical care had inferior functional outcomes in conjunction with higher rates of prescribed opioid analgesics (80%). The COST B13 European guidelinesdifferentiate between supporting the use of weak opioids (eg, tramadol), for acute and chronic back pain, and do not mention strong opioids for acute back pain. The COST B13 guideline indeed comments on the limited evidence for strong opioids in chronic back pain.

There is strong evidence that weak opioids (eg, tramadol) relieve pain and disability in the short-term in chronic low back pain patients (level A). There is limited evidence that strong opioids relieve pain in the short-term in chronic low back pain patients (level C).

Furthermore, medically managed patients received a high percentage (60%) of guideline-discordant treatment, like bed rest, X-rays, and back supports. Goertz et aldemonstrated that spinal manipulative therapy in conjunction with standard medical care offers a significant advantage for decreasing pain and improving physical functioning when compared with standard care alone for men and women between 18 and 35 years of age with acute low back pain. In contrast, Hay et alshowed that a brief pain management program for back pain delivered by appropriately trained clinicians offers an alternative to physiotherapy-incorporating manual therapy and could provide an efficient first-line approach for subacute low back pain in primary care. The inferences from these trials–are that there are various effective treatments for nonmalignant spinal pain, and that a multimodal approach, combining interventions, is likely to yield better outcomes – in this case patient education with both active and passive treatments. Such studies, among others, also firmly support the early access of patients with nonmalignant spinal pain to assessment, with an emphasis on triage and diagnosis, and appropriate treatment, to achieve the best possible outcome.–

Study selection

After removal of duplicates, 6779 records were retrieved and 6389 records were discarded. The full text of the remaining 390 records was examined and 344 did not meet the inclusion criteria: 95 involved a different study population (eg, chronic pain), 82 had mixed treatments (eg, manual therapy plus usual care), 25 described interventions not pertinent to the present study (eg, bed rest), 27 were head-to-head interventions (eg, exercise vs exercise), 10 reported outcomes not pertinent to the present study (eg, cost-effectiveness related to pain), 33 had a study design other than RCT, 8 were further duplicates, 25 were protocols, 16 were awaiting assessment for language (original not in English or Italian) and in 23 instances the full text could not be retrieved. In total, 18 authors were contacted; four of the eight who responded provided useful data for our analysis. Finally, 46 studies were included (citations in References in online supplemental C). The study flow diagram is illustrated in figure 1.

Evaluation and diagnostic approach — For patients with low back pain, we recommend the history and physical examination include evaluation for progressive or otherwise serious neurologic deficits and other red flags (e.g., signs, symptoms, history) associated with serious underlying pathology (e.g., malignancy, fracture, infection) (Strong for). For patients with low back pain, we recommend diagnostic imaging and appropriate laboratory testing when neurologic deficits are progressive or otherwise serious or when other red flags (e.g., signs, symptoms, history) are present (Strong for). For patients with acute low back pain, without focal neurologic deficits or other red flags (e.g., signs, symptoms, history), we recommend against routinely obtaining imaging studies or performing invasive diagnostic tests (Strong against). For patients with low back pain, we suggest assessing psychosocial factors and using predictive screening instruments (e.g. STarT Back and The Orebro Musculoskeletal Pain Screening Questionnaire) to inform treatment planning (Weak for). For patients with low back pain, with or without radiculopathy, there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against specific physical examination maneuvers to assist in the diagnosis of facet or sacroiliac joint pain, or a lumbar/lumbo-sacral radiculopathy (Neither for nor against).

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^d58a73d6]. DoD/VA (2022). High credibility.

VA/DoD Low Back Pain — red flags evaluation and recommendation: The Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was very low for detection of serious spinal pathologies by history/symptoms or physical examination, but given the high likelihood of catastrophic harms from a failure to identify a serious underlying condition and that the life-preserving benefits of conducting a history and physical examination to identify red flags outweigh very small potential harms, it determined a Strong recommendation is warranted and decided upon a Strong for recommendation, noting that conducting a history and physical examination including assessment of neurological deficits and red flags is generally feasible and accepted. Supporting risk data indicate that the presence of multiple red flags increases the probability of fracture to between 42% and 90%, and that urinary retention signals higher risk of cauda equina syndrome (CES), which has an estimated prevalence of 0.04% among patients presenting with LBP, whereas in patients without urinary retention, the probability of CES was approximately 0.01%.

286. doi:
10. 1001/jama.
2020. 19715 Low back pain is one of the most common reasons for seeking medical care. Most low back pain is caused by minor problems with muscles, joints, or ligaments of the back. In rare cases, low back pain is caused by a serious spinal problem. Low back pain is categorized by how long symptoms last. Acute low back pain lasts less than 4 weeks, subacute low back pain lasts 4 to 12 weeks, and chronic low back pain lasts more than 12 weeks. Patients seeking medical care for low back pain should provide a detailed medical history and undergo a physical examination. Most patients do not require diagnostic imaging of the back, such as x-rays, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging.

Patients with low back pain that is accompanied by other symptoms or signs, such as new leg weakness or paralysis, changes in bowel or bladder function, numbness around the buttocks or genitals, fever, or a history of cancer, should seek medical care as soon as possible. Most people with episodes of acute and subacute low back pain improve within weeks. Chronic low back pain symptoms are more likely to persist and fluctuate over time. For acute and subacute low back pain, according to the American College of Physicians, most patients should be advised that their back pain will improve over time, regardless of treatment. Patients should stay active as tolerated and begin with nondrug treatments, including superficial heat, massage, acupuncture, and spinal manipulation. If medicines are needed, they should be added at the lowest effective dose for the shortest period.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or skeletal muscle relaxant drugs can decrease acute and subacute low back pain. Oral or intramuscular steroids are not effective. Patients with severe pain radiating down the leg may consider further evaluation for invasive procedures. If there is a compressed nerve, invasive options might include injection of a local anesthetic and steroid near the nerve, or surgery. For patients with chronic low back pain, priority should be given to nondrug treatments combined with exercise. According to the ACP, therapies to combine with exercise include multidisciplinary rehabilitation, acupuncture, mindfulness-based stress reduction, tai chi, yoga, motor control exercises, progressive relaxation, electromyographic biofeedback, low-level laser therapy, cognitive behavior therapy, and spinal manipulation.

For patients who do not respond to nondrug treatments, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are the initial medication recommended to manage chronic low back pain. Second-line therapy includes tramadol or duloxetine. Opioids other than tramadol should be considered only for patients who do not improve with all other recommended treatments and for whom the potential benefit of opioids outweighs the known risks. Patients with disabling chronic low back pain and impaired quality of life despite noninvasive treatments may be evaluated by physicians with expertise in spinal disorders to discuss invasive treatment options, such as elective surgery or a procedure called radiofrequency denervation. Invasive treatments for low back pain require consideration of risks, benefits, and costs, as well as a patient's values and preferences. US National Library of Medicinemedlineplus.

Low back pain — lack of improvement as a red flag states that failure to improve with conservative care can be a sign of a serious medical condition or misdiagnosis, and as a general guideline, failure of a patient to demonstrate improvement in a period of time no longer than 30 days can be interpreted as a red flag.

### Diagnostic tests for low back disorders [^e91f9f23]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Diagnostic tests for low back pain (LBP) — imaging and other diagnostic testing: Lumbar spine x-rays are not recommended in patients with LBP without red flags for serious spinal pathology within the first 4 to 6 weeks, and among patients with evidence of radiculopathy, imaging in the acute setting is also not recommended; however, an imaging study may be appropriate when limitations from consistent symptoms have persisted for 1 month or more or when potentially serious pathology or progressive neurologic deficit(s) are concerns. Pretest probability and test characteristics are critical, as lumbosacral spine MRIs are more likely to be "abnormal" by age 40 in normal individuals and herniated discs are not infrequently found in asymptomatic teenagers and young adults; at present, no single imaging modality shows a clear overall advantage, though MRI is superior for soft tissues including intervertebral disc herniations. In the absence of moderate- to high-quality studies, additional diagnostic tests for LBP and spinal conditions are Not Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I), Low Confidence.

### Adding brief pain science or ergonomics messages to guideline advice did not increase feelings of reassurance in people with acute low back pain: a randomized experiment [^bc29334c]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2023). Medium credibility.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of adding pain science or ergonomics messages to guideline advice on feelings of reassurance and management intentions among people with acute low back pain (LBP). DESIGN: Three-arm parallel-group randomized experiment. METHODS: We recruited people with acute LBP (pain for ≤ 6 weeks) to participate in an online experiment. Participants were randomized at a 1:1:1 ratio to one of three groups: guideline advice alone or guideline advice with the addition of brief pain science or ergonomics messages. The intervention was delivered via prerecorded videos in all 3 groups. Coprimary outcomes were reassurance that (1) no serious condition is causing LBP and (2) continuing with daily activities is safe. Secondary outcomes were perceived risk of developing chronic pain, management intentions (bed rest, see a health professional, see a specialist, and imaging), credibility, and relevance of the advice in addressing the participant's concerns. RESULTS: Two thousand two hundred ninety-seven responses (99.3% of 2,313 randomized) were analyzed. Adding brief pain science or ergonomics messages to guideline advice did not change reassurance that LBP was not caused by serious disease. The addition of ergonomics advice provided worse reassurance that it is safe to continue with daily activities compared to guideline advice (mean difference [MD], -0.33; 95% CI: 0.13, 0.53). There was no difference between groups on management intentions. CONCLUSION: Adding pain science or ergonomics messages to guideline advice did not increase reassurance or change management intentions in people with acute LBP. Ergonomics messages may lead to reduced feelings of reassurance. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2023;53(12)1–11. Epub 26 September 2023. doi:10.2519/jospt.2023.12090.

### ACR appropriateness criteria low back Pain [^ebf9c160]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Most patients presenting with uncomplicated acute low back pain (LBP) and/or radiculopathy do not require imaging. Imaging is considered in those patients who have had up to 6 weeks of medical management and physical therapy that resulted in little or no improvement in their back pain. It is also considered for those patients presenting with red flags raising suspicion for serious underlying conditions, such as cauda equina syndrome, malignancy, fracture, and infection. Many imaging modalities are available to clinicians and radiologists for evaluating LBP. Application of these modalities depends largely on the working diagnosis, the urgency of the clinical problem, and comorbidities of the patient. When there is concern for fracture of the lumbar spine, multidetector CT is recommended. Those deemed to be interventional candidates, with LBP lasting for > 6 weeks having completed conservative management with persistent radiculopathic symptoms, may seek MRI. Patients with severe or progressive neurologic deficit on presentation and red flags should be evaluated with MRI. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances in which evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

The GP delivered targeted treatment for patients in the low-risk subgroup

Patients classified at low risk of chronicity at the time of GP consultation are to receive best primary care advice and management by their GP. All patients will have a brief clinical assessment to screen for red flags and GPs will encourage patients to ask questions relating to any specific concerns about their LBP. GPs will provide reassurance about good overall prognosis, the benign nature of the LBP and simple messages and advice about pain relief, appropriate physical activity levels, return to normal activity, including work, avoiding bed rest, appropriate use of pain relieving modalities and the role of further investigations. To reinforce these key messages the Arthritis Research UK advice sheet about back exercisecan be given to the patient. Onward referral to other services will not be recommended for this patient subgroup, although re-consultation with the GP is to be advised if symptoms persist.

### Low back pain [^f043981e]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2012). Medium credibility.

Imaging studies in low back pain — overall role and indications emphasize limited diagnostic value for routine use: Imaging modalities have frequent false positive and negative results, the primary utility of imaging lies in interventional and/or surgical planning or in determining the presence of serious medical conditions, and lumbar magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) represents the most useful tool. Routine ordering of imaging for low back pain should be discouraged, and current recommendations from the American College of Physicians are that (1) imaging is only indicated for severe progressive neurological deficits or when red flags are suspected, and (2) routine imaging does not result in clinical benefit and may lead to harm.

### Restricted activity and persistent pain following motor vehicle collision among older adults: a multicenter prospective cohort study [^713217e3]. BMC Geriatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Physical activity is a modifiable and potentially important risk factor for persistent pain and functional decline in older adults involved in an MVC. Promoting physical activity improves outcomes in patients with chronic low back pain and hip fracture, and encouraging a return to normal activities and neck exercises improves outcomes in younger adults with acute neck pain due to MVC (i.e. whiplash). Experimental studies suggest a possible mechanism underlying the benefit of early physical activity following an injury: remaining physically activity during the first two weeks after nerve injury inhibits generation of nociceptive fibers. In contrast, complete inactivity even as brief as one week has profound negative effects on overall health and physical function, and advising patients to stay in bed following an episode of acute low back pain increases the risk for persistent pain. A recent study of community-dwelling older adults found bed rest to be a stronger predictor of subsequent functional decline than cutting down activities, suggesting that not all types of restricted activity have the same consequences. Understanding the relationship between restricted physical activity during the early aftermath of MVC and long-term outcomes has the potential to inform interventions to prevent the transition from acute to persistent pain.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the relationship between physical activity and persistent pain among older adults involved in an MVC. Specifically, we sought to assess associations between three measures of restricted activity in the first 6 weeks after MVC and persistent pain, pain interference, and decreased functional capacity at 6 months.

### Enhancing healthcare professionals' biopsychosocial perspective to chronic pain: assessing the impact of implementing an interdisciplinary training program [^82867ce5]. Pain (2025). Medium credibility.

Guideline-adherent recommendations improved significantly from baseline to post-training and to 6-month follow-up in all domains, resulting in a high percentage of HCPs' recommending to continue activities, return to sports, return to work, and avoid bed rest, and being less likely to support opioids (Table 3). Recommendations regarding bed rest and opioids remained relatively less guideline-adherent compared with others at each measurement. However, a significant decrease in guideline-adherent bed rest recommendation was found between post-training and 6-month follow-up in the clinical vignette about chronic neck pain.

Table 3
Short-term and mid-term changes resulted in a high percentage of guideline-adherent recommendations after the interdisciplinary training program (N = 405).

At 6-month follow-up, a significant portion of participants demonstrated a substantial biopsychosocial understanding of pain and supporting nonpharmaceutical pain management, including exercise therapy and pain science education (Fig. 4). However, only 66.9% of the participants agreed to a large extent that pain is always the outcome of the brain and 40.7% that hypersensitivity of the pain system can sometimes be beneficial. Moreover, a notable proportion of the participants disagreed to a large extent that correcting malaligned spine (59.6%) and correcting poor posture (30.3%) reduce chronic pain, that painful exercise should be avoided (59.3%), and that activity levels should be increased based on pain experience (23.7%).

Module A: Initial evaluation of low back pain (LBP) begins with an adult patient with LBP and directs clinicians to perform a focused history and physical examination evaluating duration of symptoms, red flags for potentially serious conditions, presence and severity of radiculopathy and/or neurologic deficits, and psychosocial risk factors (see Recommendation 4). If there are progressive or otherwise serious neurologic deficits or other red flags (e.g., signs, symptoms, history) for serious conditions (see Sidebars 1 and 2), perform appropriate evaluation for serious conditions (see Sidebar 1 and Recommendations 1–3); if serious conditions are identified, address any serious conditions as indicated and consider specialty consultation. If back pain is chronic (≥ 3 months), assess whether the patient has had appropriate treatment; if yes, go to Module B, Box 18 (assess treatment response), and if no, go to Module B, Box 18 (assess treatment response). If not chronic, engage the patient in a shared decision making process to develop an individualized care plan: advise about self-care, discuss noninvasive treatment options (pharmacologic, non-pharmacologic, watchful waiting), and arrive at a shared decision regarding treatment. If the patient chose pharmacologic and/or non-pharmacologic treatment, determine if the patient is on treatment; if yes, go to Module B, Box 18 (assess treatment response), and if no, go to Module B, Box 16 (untreated LBP). If the patient did not choose treatment, continue self-care and reassess in primary care as appropriate.

Results and hypothesis

The absence of a between-group difference in this study challenges its underlying assumptions and hypothesis. Firstly, we had assumed that MCs were the cause of pain in this patient cohort. However, it is likely that spine-related pathoanatomical changes other than MCs or perhaps psychosocial factors may have influenced or caused the pain. Secondly, if MCs were the main cause of pain in this cohort and if rest were useful, the dosage may have been insufficient. It is possible that a few hours of rest a day is not sufficient to counteract the load induced by the activities of daily life. Thirdly, MCs consist of histologically different subtypes and it may be that subgroups of type, size and location of MCs could respond differently to treatment. Such a subanalysis of predictive factors for outcome will be reported in another paper. Lastly, the underlying hypothesis that MCs are caused by a biomechanical alteration of the disco-vertebral complex could be inadequate. Other hypotheses of explanatory pathoanatomic pathways exist, such as the possibility that the inflammation seen on MRI in MCs is caused by low virulent bacteria.

There was a small yet statistically significant improvement at both time-points for pain and disability at a whole group level. However, because we did not include a 'no treatment' group, we were not able to test whether the slight improvement occurring in both groups was due to an equal treatment effect in both groups or if the treatments had no effect and the improvement was a consequence of the natural course. Also, as this study sample consisted of patients with MCs only, we do not know if the overall poor prognosis is unique for this subpopulation. To explore this would require a different study design including patients both with and without MCs.

### How does the self-reported clinical management of patients with low back pain relate to the attitudes and beliefs of health care practitioners? A survey of UK general practitioners and physiotherapists [^ce20980c]. Pain (2008). Low credibility.

1 Introduction

Low back pain (LBP) is common, affecting 38% of adults in any one year, of whom 1 in 4 experience significant disability. Only 25% of patients consulting in primary care will be symptom free 12 months later. The last two decades have also seen dramatic rises in work loss and sickness benefit payments, attributed to recurrent and persistent LBP.

Guidelines for the clinical management of patients with LBP encourage health care practitioners (HCPs) to advise patients to stay active, avoid bed rest, stay at or return to work, and stress simple messages about self-management. Previous studies have identified that HCPs do not always follow guideline recommendations for LBPand so despite the abundance of guidelines for practice, the management of LBP poses considerable challenges and frustrations for both patients and practitionersand it is increasingly clear that it is insufficient to study patient factors alone.

A potentially important but relatively unexplored influence on patients' pain experiences is the attitudes and beliefs of the HCPs with whom they come into contact. HCPs are frequently asked to provide advice and recommendations about physical activities, work, and rest and HCPs' attitudes and beliefs may be an integral part of the health care process, influencing the success or failure of treatment. HCPs hold a range of attitudes and beliefs about back pain, and these attitudes appear to be associated with the work and activity recommendations that HCPs give to patients.

In the UK, approximately 98% of the population is registered with a National Health Service general practitioner (GP). GPs serve as gatekeepers to secondary care, selecting and referring patients for specialist investigations and treatment services. Physiotherapy is one of the most common services to which patients are referred, or which patients seek out privately, and LBP accounts for more than half of physiotherapists' workload in the UK.

Few studies have explored HCP factors in the UK, but it has been shown that many physiotherapists (PTs) continue to advise limitations of work and activity levels, despite identifying when patients with LBP are at risk of chronicityand an important proportion of therapists continue treating patients with LBP even when they fail to improve. The aim of this study was to measure, in national random samples, the attitudes, beliefs and reported clinical behaviour of GPs and PTs about LBP, explore their associations and evaluate the implications for both clinical practice and future research.

### Evaluation and treatment of acute back pain in the emergency department [^f197b9fd]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Back pain is a common presenting complaint to the emergency department. The key to proper evaluation is a history and physical examination focused on determining if any red flags for serious disease are present. If no red flags are present, the patient most likely has nonspecific back pain and their symptoms will resolve in 4 to 6 weeks. No diagnostic testing is required. For patients with red flags, a focused history and examination in conjunction with diagnostic laboratory tests and imaging determine whether the patient has an emergent condition such as herniated disc, epidural compression, or spinal infection.

What you need to know

Less than 5–10% of all low back pain is due to a specific underlying spinal pathology
The remaining 90–95% has no indication of a serious cause and should be managed with conservative treatments such as advice and reassurance, exercise, physical therapy, chiropractic care, cognitive-behavioural therapy, or pain management
Diagnostic triage based on clinical history and examination can help distinguish between non-specific or more serious low back pain
Imaging may do more harm than good when serious conditions are not suspected and is likely to prolong recovery in patients with non-specific low back pain
Patients' primary concerns of whether their pain is caused by something serious and what they should do to aid recovery can be addressed by sound education and reassurance, without the need for imaging

### Effectiveness of treatments for acute and subacute mechanical non-specific low back pain: a systematic review with network meta-analysis [^14a07cc5]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Low back pain is a common symptom in people of all ages and socioeconomic status. The worldwide point prevalence of low back pain (acute, subacute and chronic) was 7.83% (95% CI 7.04 to 8.64) in 2017, with 577 million people affected at any one time. In 2017, low back pain was responsible for around 65 million years lived with disability, representing a deterioration of about 17.5% since 2007 mainly owing to population growth and ageing, with the greatest increase recorded for low-income and middle-income countries. People more often leave their job because of low back pain than diabetes, hypertension, neoplasm, asthma, heart and respiratory disease combined. About one in four adults in the USA had low back pain that lasted for at least 24 hours within the previous 3 months, with 7.6% adults reporting at least one episode of severe acute low back pain within a 1-year period. Moderate-to-severe pain and impairment of motor and psychological functions due to low back pain are the primary reasons for seeking medical consultation from a general practitioner.

Despite its high prevalence, low back pain has a generally good prognosis. While a specific cause of low back pain can seldom be identified, the most prevalent type is mechanical, non-specific low back pain (NS-LBP). Most episodes of acute and subacute NS-LBP improve significantly within 6 weeks, and the average pain intensity is moderate (6 on a 100-point scale; 95% CI 3 to 10) by 12 months. However, two-thirds of people with low back pain still experience pain at 3 months (67%, 95% CI 50% to 83%) and at 12 months (65%, 95% CI 54% to 75%).

Most guidelines agree on the first line of care in case of acute episode: advice, reassurance and encouragement to engage in light physical activity. When second-line treatment is needed, a range of therapeutic interventions (pharmacological and physiotherapy) for acute NS-LBP are available. The relative effects of various treatment options, when each option is compared against all others, are not well known. This uncertainty is reflected in the variety of recommendations in recent guidelines for acute NS-LBP. We explored the relative efficacy of currently available treatments for acute and subacute mechanical NS-LBP in terms of benefit and harm via a systematic review of the literature and network meta-analysis (NMA).

### Triage for nonspecific lower-back pain [^36e2ef55]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2006). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Unremitting lower-back pain has long been a costly and personally devastating problem in society. Guidelines for the treatment of lower-back pain have provided evidence-based recommendations to help identify patients who will benefit from specific types of treatment in an effort to reduce costs and human suffering. However, there is little evidence that these guidelines are being applied in the daily practice of health care providers. Practical information is required to assist health care providers in triaging patients for specific treatments so that interventions can be targeted only to those who need them. In this way, iatrogenic complications and unnecessary costs can be contained. This chapter provides information on how to triage the patient with nonspecific lower-back pain for optimal care. The recommendations are supported by evidence-based guidelines, and when these are not available, best practice principles. Because appropriate treatment varies depending on the length of time a patient is suffering from lower-back pain, the chapter is divided into recommendations for acute, subacute, chronic and recurrent phases of lower-back pain.

### Applying a knowledge translation framework for triaging low back pain and radicular pain at an emergency department: an iterative process within an uncontrolled before-and-after design [^e30ce890]. BMJ Open Quality (2022). High credibility.

Background

Low back pain (LBP) is the number one cause of years lived with disability worldwide, with a point prevalence of 9.6% and an incidence rate of 3951 new cases/100 000 individuals per year. In Belgium, the situation seems even worse with a point-prevalence of 18.2%. In approximately 10% of the cases, the pain and functional impairment will continue beyond 3 months after onset, which results in high healthcare costs and work absence. Therefore, appropriate management of acute LBP and investment in the avoidance of chronicity is crucial.

In the large majority of patients with acute onset LBP and radicular pain, pain and function are likely to recover spontaneously within weeks. Most often, acute LBP is not attributable to a specific cause, but rather represents an acute mechanical overload leading to symptoms because of reduced load bearing capacity. Reassurance and activation are most accurate in those situations and referral to specialist medical care is not required on the condition that a competent healthcare professional has ruled out potentially worrisome pathologies that might potentially endanger the patient when missed (also called 'red flags'). In the absence of red flags, imaging does not affect management. On the contrary, it has been shown that referral of these patients for diagnostic imaging or for a medical specialist consult may rather facilitate chronicity, disability and overmedicalisation. Imaging, however, is still being overused in LBP. Evidence indicates that diagnostic imaging for LBP without any indication of a serious underlying cause does not improve patient outcomes and can in fact be harmful to patients due to radiation exposure on the one hand and imposing a sickness label on patients on the other hand.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^100812ef]. DoD/VA (2022). High credibility.

Low back pain (LBP) — history and physical examination guidance and red flags are outlined as follows. Conducting a history and physical examination is considered standard of care and a cornerstone of clinical decision making, and history and physical examination should include assessment of signs and symptoms of serious underlying pathology. Signs and symptoms of serious underlying pathology requiring additional diagnostic workup and prompt treatment are generally referred to as "red flags." For cauda equina syndrome or conus medullaris syndrome, red flags include urinary retention, urinary or fecal incontinence, saddle anesthesia, changes in rectal tone, and severe/progressive lower extremity neurologic deficits. Infection red flags include fever, immunosuppression, IV drug use, and recent infection, indwelling catheters (e.g., central line, Foley). Fracture risk red flags include history of osteoporosis, chronic use of corticosteroids, older age (≥ 75 years old), recent trauma, and younger patients at risk for stress fracture (e.g., overuse). Cancer red flags include history of cancer with new onset of LBP, unexplained weight loss, failure of LBP to improve after 1 month, age > 50 years, and multiple risk factors present.

### Non-specific low back pain [^ab447dc9]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

Non-specific low back pain affects people of all ages and is a leading contributor to disease burden worldwide. Management guidelines endorse triage to identify the rare cases of low back pain that are caused by medically serious pathology, and so require diagnostic work-up or specialist referral, or both. Because non-specific low back pain does not have a known pathoanatomical cause, treatment focuses on reducing pain and its consequences. Management consists of education and reassurance, analgesic medicines, non-pharmacological therapies, and timely review. The clinical course of low back pain is often favourable, thus many patients require little if any formal medical care. Two treatment strategies are currently used, a stepped approach beginning with more simple care that is progressed if the patient does not respond, and the use of simple risk prediction methods to individualise the amount and type of care provided. The overuse of imaging, opioids, and surgery remains a widespread problem.

### Diagnostic tests for low back disorders [^80041dc9]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Low back pain (LBP) clinical evaluation — history, physical examination, and red flags: No quality studies assess the utility and/or components of a history and physical examination; nevertheless, the Panel's consensus recommendation is that a careful history and physical examination is naturally important for appropriate evaluation and diagnosis. The initial assessment of LBP has a unique emphasis on 'ruling out' serious underlying conditions, and this process primarily relies upon the identification of red flags that in employed populations include trauma, history of cancer, immunosuppression, progressive neurological deficit, renal colic, and history of urinary tract infections. The absence of red flags and conditions generally rules out the need for specialist studies, referral, or inpatient care during the first 4 to 6 weeks. A comprehensive evaluation and documentation include history, prior treatment, vocation and avocational activities, functional level, medical and family history, social history including substance(s) use, review of systems, laboratory testing, and imaging studies. Evaluation using repeated end-range testing while monitoring for patterns of pain response determines the presence or absence of directional preference and pain centralization.

Neck pain with radiating pain — physical agents (acute stage): For patients with acute neck pain with radiating pain, there was a benefit, when compared to a control, in using 905-nm laser for reducing pain, improving function, global perceived effect, and quality of life over the immediate and intermediate term, and mild adverse events were equal in treatment and placebo groups. For acute cases, a cervical collar had benefit for reducing arm pain over the short but not intermediate term, yet there was no benefit, when compared to a control, in using a semi-rigid collar for improving function over the short, intermediate, or long term. For traction, there was no benefit, when compared to a control, in using intermittent traction for reducing pain in the short term and no benefit in using continuous traction for reducing pain or disability over the immediate, short, and intermediate term. For neck pain with radiating pain and a diagnosis of mild cervical myelopathy, there was a benefit, compared to surgery, in using multimodal nonsurgical management (intermittent use of collar or bed rest, medications, and activity modification) for improving gait speed over the long term with no difference in neurological status or performance of daily living activities, and traction, as part of nonsurgical management, should not be routinely prescribed for patients with moderate to severe cervical myelopathy.
