## Question

Treatment for seborrheic dermatitis resistant to topical antifungals

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about treatment options for seborrheic dermatitis that is resistant to topical antifungals. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and excluding mimics. Then, I should verify what constitutes adequate antifungal therapy and common reasons for apparent treatment failure. Next, I will review evidence-based escalation strategies, including topical anti-inflammatories, calcineurin inhibitors, and newer agents like roflumilast. After that, I should consider systemic options and special populations. Finally, I will integrate maintenance strategies and summarize a practical, stepwise algorithm with safety considerations and monitoring plans.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and rule out mimics, because persistent erythema and scaling can reflect psoriasis, rosacea, contact dermatitis, tinea, or even cutaneous lymphoma, and misclassification is a frequent cause of apparent treatment failure. I should double-check distribution, morphology, and history, and consider a biopsy if the presentation is atypical or refractory to appropriate therapy, especially in adults with nonresponsive disease [^51e87460] [^156052d5].

> Wait, let me verify what "adequate" topical antifungal therapy looks like before labeling a case as resistant. For facial or intertriginous disease, ketoconazole 2% cream or ciclopirox 1% cream applied once or twice daily for at least 2 to 4 weeks is standard, with scalp involvement managed by antifungal shampoos such as ketoconazole 2% or ciclopirox 1% used two to three times weekly, and adherence and application technique should be reviewed because underuse or early discontinuation is common and can masquerade as treatment failure [^333caa52] [^1b86c7d6] [^d1447551].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should also consider whether the patient is using combination products or has been switching agents too frequently, and whether there are modifiable triggers such as stress, cold/dry weather, or heavy sebum production that could blunt antifungal efficacy. The Cochrane reviews emphasize heterogeneity in dosing, vehicles, and outcome measures across trials, underscoring that real-world optimization of formulation and regimen matters before declaring resistance [^6607795f] [^bc66b2de].

> Next, I should review escalation to topical anti-inflammatory therapy, because antifungal failure often reflects a dominant inflammatory phenotype. Low-potency corticosteroids such as hydrocortisone 1–2.5% or desonide 0.05% can be used short course on the face for 1–2 weeks to rapidly suppress inflammation, then tapered to minimize risks of atrophy and telangiectasia. Guidelines endorse topical corticosteroids for face and scalp when needed, with explicit caution about prolonged use [^8633450b] [^333caa52].

> I will now examine calcineurin inhibitors as steroid-sparing options for refractory facial or intertriginous disease. Pimecrolimus 1% cream and tacrolimus 0.1% ointment have RCT-level support showing efficacy comparable to steroids in some studies, with the advantage of avoiding atrophy. They are particularly useful for maintenance or in patients with frequent relapses, though transient burning or stinging can occur and patients should be counseled accordingly [^340f0018] [^b33cb9d2] [^00bcecc9].

> But wait, what if topical therapy continues to fail despite good adherence and technique? I should consider newer targeted agents. Roflumilast 0.3% foam, a topical PDE4 inhibitor, has phase 2 RCT data demonstrating significant improvement versus vehicle with favorable tolerability, and case literature suggests rapid onset within 24–48 hours in some flares. This is a promising option for refractory scalp or facial disease, especially when steroids are undesirable long term [^dff9406b] [^6002df57] [^0ab677a3].

> Let me consider systemic therapy for widespread, severe, or highly recurrent disease. Short-course oral itraconazole 200 mg daily for 7 days, repeated monthly for 2–3 months, or fluconazole 300 mg weekly for 2–4 weeks have supportive evidence and are reasonable in carefully selected patients after topical failure, with attention to drug interactions and hepatic monitoring. I should confirm that topical therapy was optimized before escalating systemically [^c2cd861e] [^d80ac48e].

> I need to ensure I address special populations. In patients with darker skin tones, postinflammatory hypopigmentation is common and chronic steroid use can worsen it; calcineurin inhibitors are preferred for maintenance in this context. In immunocompromised patients, including HIV, seborrheic dermatitis is often more severe and may require more aggressive or prolonged therapy, and clinicians should maintain a lower threshold for systemic antifungals while monitoring for adverse effects and interactions [^9060e332] [^a6cbde4e].

> Next, I should review maintenance strategies because seborrheic dermatitis is chronic and relapsing. Intermittent use of antifungal shampoos or creams, with or without calcineurin inhibitors, helps prolong remission. A randomized maintenance trial showed tacrolimus 0.1% twice weekly prolonged disease-free duration versus ciclopiroxolamine 1% after induction, supporting a maintenance-first approach in frequent relapsers [^3872b785] [^333caa52].

> Hold on, I should verify that I am not overlooking nonpharmacologic and adjunctive measures. Gentle cleansing, minimizing harsh surfactants, and using nonmedicated emollients can support barrier repair, and in scalp disease, keratolytic shampoos can reduce scale burden to improve penetration of antifungals. These steps are especially helpful in patients with thick, hyperkeratotic plaques or in winter months when disease flares [^156052d5] [^c62342c0].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stepwise algorithm while keeping safety front and center. First, confirm the diagnosis and optimize topical antifungal use and adherence. Second, add a short course of low-potency corticosteroid for rapid control if inflammation is prominent. Third, transition to a calcineurin inhibitor for maintenance or if steroids are contraindicated. Fourth, consider roflumilast foam for refractory scalp or facial disease. Fifth, reserve systemic itraconazole or fluconazole for severe, widespread, or recurrent cases after topical failure. Throughout, monitor for adverse effects, minimize steroid exposure, and tailor to patient preference, comorbidities, and skin type [^333caa52] [^340f0018] [^dff9406b] [^c2cd861e].

> Finally, I should double-check that my plan aligns with the evidence hierarchy and guideline direction. The AAFP guidance supports antifungals, corticosteroids, and calcineurin inhibitors as core options, with newer agents like roflumilast expanding the armamentarium for refractory disease. Given the chronic, relapsing nature of seborrheic dermatitis, I need to set expectations, build in maintenance, and remain open to iterative adjustments based on response and tolerability [^333caa52] [^340f0018] [^dff9406b].

For seborrheic dermatitis refractory to topical antifungals, **topical calcineurin inhibitors** (tacrolimus 0.1% or pimecrolimus 1%) are first-line alternatives [^340f0018] [^b33cb9d2], with robust evidence of efficacy and a favorable safety profile for facial and intertriginous disease [^acc32db8]. If calcineurin inhibitors are insufficient, **low-potency topical corticosteroids** (e.g. hydrocortisone 2.5% or desonide 0.05%) can be added short-term for rapid control, then tapered to minimize adverse effects [^8633450b] [^333caa52]. For scalp or extensive disease, consider **roflumilast 0.3% foam** (PDE4 inhibitor) [^dff9406b] or short-course oral itraconazole 200 mg daily for 7 days, repeated monthly for 2–3 months [^c2cd861e]. Maintenance with antifungal shampoos or creams and calcineurin inhibitors helps prevent relapse; avoid prolonged corticosteroids to limit atrophy and telangiectasia [^333caa52] [^3872b785].

---

## Topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs)

TCIs are **first-line alternatives** when antifungals fail, particularly on the face and in intertriginous areas, and are steroid-sparing with a favorable safety profile [^340f0018] [^171d0edf].

- **Tacrolimus 0.1% ointment**: Effective for facial and intertriginous SD; randomized data show prolonged disease-free duration versus ciclopiroxolamine 1% in maintenance therapy [^3872b785].

- **Pimecrolimus 1% cream**: Effective for facial SD [^b33cb9d2]; randomized trials show faster improvement and lower relapse than sertaconazole 2% [^b4e6c79d].

- **Safety**: Local burning/itching is common but transient; no significant systemic absorption or immunosuppression reported with topical use [^171d0edf].

---

## Topical corticosteroids

Low-potency corticosteroids are useful for **rapid control of inflammation** when antifungals fail, but should be used short-term to minimize adverse effects [^8633450b] [^333caa52].

- **Hydrocortisone 2.5% cream or desonide 0.05% cream**: Apply once or twice daily for 1–2 weeks, then taper; avoid prolonged use to prevent atrophy and telangiectasia [^8633450b] [^333caa52].

- **Combination therapy**: Short-term corticosteroids combined with antifungals or TCIs can improve clearance and reduce steroid exposure [^4015b690] [^711a7a03].

---

## Roflumilast 0.3% foam

Roflumilast, a topical PDE4 inhibitor, is a **new option** with anti-inflammatory and potential antifungal effects, and is well tolerated with low systemic absorption [^dff9406b] [^6002df57].

- **Efficacy**: Phase 2 RCT showed significant improvement versus vehicle in moderate-to-severe SD, including scalp and facial disease [^dff9406b].

- **Safety**: Low rates of burning/stinging; favorable tolerability profile [^6002df57].

- **Use**: Once-daily foam for scalp or facial SD, especially when steroids are undesirable [^dff9406b].

---

## Systemic antifungal therapy

For extensive or refractory disease, **short-course oral antifungals** can be considered [^c2cd861e].

- **Itraconazole**: 200 mg daily for 7 days, repeated monthly for 2–3 months; monitor liver function and drug interactions [^c2cd861e].

- **Fluconazole**: Limited evidence; 300 mg weekly for 2 weeks showed marginal benefit in a small RCT [^d80ac48e].

---

## Maintenance strategies

Maintenance therapy is essential to prevent relapse; **individualize** based on disease severity and patient preference [^333caa52].

- **Antifungal shampoos**: Ketoconazole 2% or ciclopirox 1% shampoo once or twice weekly for scalp disease [^notfound].

- **Topical calcineurin inhibitors**: Intermittent use (e.g. twice weekly) for facial or intertriginous disease [^3872b785].

- **Patient education**: Emphasize adherence, trigger avoidance, and gentle skin care [^c0690dd5].

---

## Safety considerations

- **Topical corticosteroids**: Limit duration to ≤ 2 weeks on the face; monitor for atrophy, telangiectasia, and perioral dermatitis [^8633450b] [^333caa52].

- **Calcineurin inhibitors**: Transient burning/itching is common; no increased risk of infection or malignancy reported with topical use [^171d0edf].

- **Systemic antifungals**: Monitor liver function and drug interactions with itraconazole [^notfound].

## Summary of treatment algorithm

| **Step** | **Treatment** | **Indication** | **Duration** |
|-|-|-|-|
| 1 | Topical calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus 0.1% or pimecrolimus 1%) | Facial or intertriginous SD refractory to antifungals | Indefinite; intermittent maintenance |
| 2 | Low-potency topical corticosteroids (hydrocortisone 2.5% or desonide 0.05%) | Rapid control of inflammation | 1–2 weeks, then taper |
| 3 | Roflumilast 0.3% foam | Moderate-to-severe SD, including scalp | Once daily; indefinite |
| 4 | Systemic itraconazole 200 mg daily | Extensive or refractory disease | 7 days, repeat monthly × 2–3 |
| 5 | Maintenance therapy (antifungal shampoos, TCIs) | Prevention of relapse | Indefinite |

---

For SD refractory to topical antifungals, **TCIs are first-line alternatives**, with low-potency corticosteroids for short-term control, roflumilast or systemic itraconazole for refractory cases, and maintenance therapy to prevent relapse.

Implications for research

The following issues should be attended to in future trials.

Methodological quality - Trial investigators should describe random sequence allocation, allocation concealment and blinding when reporting trials, as would this would make for greater certainty of conclusions.
Completeness of reporting - Side effects and conflicts of interest should be better reported.
Validated outcome measures - This review has emphasised the applicability of validated outcome measures. Expert committees of dermatologists should consider what outcome measures would most objectively assess treatment efficacy in seborrhoeic dermatitis. These should be streamlined and validated. In the interim, all trials should report the proportions of participants with complete clearance of symptoms.
Participant-oriented outcome variables - Measures such as quality of life index would enhance the objectivity of the assessment of efficacy and would provide participants' perspectives on level of efficacy. Future research should consider using these measures, albeit in a standardised way, for outcome assessment.
Compliance with treatment regimen - This clearly impacts outcomes for any mode of treatment. A summary documentation of actual compliance among participants completing trials could be used to stratify analyses of efficacy.
Longer-term assessments with follow-up of at least one year are needed because seborrhoic dermatitis is a chronic condition with a high relapse rate. This plan will also enable better long-term assessment of side effects. A treatment regimen is needed for the intermittent delivery of active agent to a site at a rate that would compromise neither efficacy nor participant compliance. This consideration would address and define parameters for sustained remission.
Economic evaluations - As most of the included studies were conducted in high-income countries, the suitability of evidence so obtained for providers in resource-constrained settings, where prescribers often have to decide between effectiveness and affordability of care, remains questionable. Good economic evaluations would give an indication regarding which option would best suit the collective objectives of patients, providers and the financing system.
We found various kinds of placebo favoured by different trial investigators. Given the high rate of resolution of symptoms under placebo treatment (about 25%), it is important to find out which aspects of treatment could account for this. Some of these placebos were vehicles and bases commonly used as carriers for the active agent. Specific formulations of many placebos were unstated. We considered that the formulation of the placebo may have implications for efficacy. Although this review did not include an analysis based on choice of comparative placebo, it would seem a reasonable undertaking. Subsequent reviews on this topic should explore this question.

Background

Seborrhoeic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that is distributed worldwide. It commonly affects the scalp, face and flexures of the body. Treatment options include antifungal drugs, steroids, calcineurin inhibitors, keratolytic agents and phototherapy.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antifungal agents for seborrhoeic dermatitis of the face and scalp in adolescents and adults. A secondary objective is to assess whether the same interventions are effective in the management of seborrhoeic dermatitis in patients with HIV/AIDS.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to December 2014: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2014, Issue 11), MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974) and Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) (from 1982). We also searched trials registries and checked the bibliographies of published studies for further trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of topical antifungals used for treatment of seborrhoeic dermatitis in adolescents and adults, with primary outcome measures of complete clearance of symptoms and improved quality of life.

Data Collection and Analysis

Review author pairs independently assessed eligibility for inclusion, extracted study data and assessed risk of bias of included studies. We performed fixed-effect meta-analysis for studies with low statistical heterogeneity and used a random-effects model when heterogeneity was high.

Main Results

We included 51 studies with 9052 participants. Of these, 45 trials assessed treatment outcomes at five weeks or less after commencement of treatment, and six trials assessed outcomes over a longer time frame. We believe that 24 trials had some form of conflict of interest, such as funding by pharmaceutical companies. Among the included studies were 12 ketoconazole trials (N = 3253), 11 ciclopirox trials (N = 3029), two lithium trials (N = 141), two bifonazole trials (N = 136) and one clotrimazole trial (N = 126) that compared the effectiveness of these treatments versus placebo or vehicle. Nine ketoconazole trials (N = 632) and one miconazole trial (N = 47) compared these treatments versus steroids. Fourteen studies (N = 1541) compared one antifungal versus another or compared different doses or schedules of administration of the same agent versus one another. KetoconazoleTopical ketoconazole 2% treatment showed a 31% lower risk of failed clearance of rashes compared with placebo (risk ratio (RR) 0.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59 to 0.81, eight studies, low-quality evidence) at four weeks of follow-up, but the effect on side effects was uncertain because evidence was of very low quality (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.64, six studies); heterogeneity between studies was substantial (I² = 74%). The median proportion of those who did not have clearance in the placebo groups was 69%. Ketoconazole treatment resulted in a remission rate similar to that of steroids (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.44, six studies, low-quality evidence), but occurrence of side effects was 44% lower in the ketoconazole group than in the steroid group (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.96, eight studies, moderate-quality evidence). Ketoconozale yielded a similar remission failure rate as ciclopirox (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.26, three studies, low-quality evidence). Most comparisons between ketoconazole and other antifungals were based on single studies that showed comparability of treatment effects. CiclopiroxCiclopirox 1% led to a lower failed remission rate than placebo at four weeks of follow-up (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.94, eight studies, moderate-quality evidence) with similar rates of side effects (RR 0.9, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.11, four studies, moderate-quality evidence). Other antifungalsClotrimazole and miconazole efficacies were comparable with those of steroids on short-term assessment in single studies. Treatment effects on individual symptoms were less clear and were inconsistent, possibly because of difficulties encountered in measuring these symptoms. Evidence was insufficient to conclude that dose or mode of delivery influenced treatment outcome. Only one study reported on treatment compliance. No study assessed quality of life. One study assessed the maximum rash-free period but provided insufficient data for analysis. One small study in patients with HIV compared the effect of lithium versus placebo on seborrhoeic dermatitis of the face, but treatment outcomes were similar.

Authors' Conclusions

Ketoconazole and ciclopirox are more effective than placebo, but limited evidence suggests that either of these agents is more effective than any other agent within the same class. Very few studies have assessed symptom clearance for longer periods than four weeks. Ketoconazole produced findings similar to those of steroids, but side effects were fewer. Treatment effect on overall quality of life remains unknown. Better outcome measures, studies of better quality and better reporting are all needed to improve the evidence base for antifungals for seborrhoeic dermatitis.

### Topical antifungals for seborrhoeic dermatitis [^bc66b2de]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

The rationale for certain treatment regimens was seldom given; most studies simply stated that participants were treated for four weeks with a 2% solution to be applied twice daily. However, wide variation in dose and mode of delivery was observed without a clear explanation for this. It is interesting no relationship between dose and the outcome 'clearance of symptoms' was obvious at the study level as an indirect comparison. It was only when individual symptom outcomes were assessed that higher doses seemed to produce a better treatment effect. However, this observation was based only on single studies. In direct comparisons of dose effect, no reason was found to conclude that different doses had different treatment effects.

The major problem with the quality of the evidence was how outcomes were measured. We failed to identify any validated outcome measure for seborrhoeic dermatitis or outcome measures conventionally endorsed by expert committees or ranking specialist fora. This situation also applies to other dermatological disorders, as our consultation with experts in the field revealed. Our principal outcome measure, namely, total clearance, has face validity, but we do not know how reliably it can be measured. Global severity scores have the drawback that they can be based on assessment of any symptom/affected area combination, which could weaken the reliability of the measure. Therefore, we excluded studies that measured outcomes in this way. They are listed under excluded studies. Although we undertook rigorous assessment of treatment outcomes, considerable heterogeneity was observed in most comparisons, which we could explain only by attributing differences to the absence of validated outcome measures.

Reliable quality of life measurements, which constitute one of our prespecified outcome measures, could prevent in part measurement at symptom level and indicate how treatment influences a more general outcome. However no studies used this outcome. In addition, what constitutes a clinically relevant change in scores for symptoms is unclear. A validated scale should take the clinically relevant change into account.

Differences between protocol and review

Title

We changed the review title from 'Interventions for seborrhoeic dermatitis' to 'Topical antifungals for seborrhoeic dermatitis'. In the protocol, we presented this review as an all-encompassing interventions review for seborrhoeic dermatitis. We had to modify that goal and limit ourselves to topical antifungal agents used for treatment of seborrhoeic dermatitis. This decision was made because of the multiplicity of comparisons and the equally diverse outcome variables that we encountered. We reasoned that for meaningful comparisons, leading to coherent conclusions, it was best to split the review into segments focusing on major classes of treatment as we identified them from the trials that we scoured, which will be published in series, at the end of which an overview can be written.

Searches

We had proposed to conduct a search for side effects of various interventions used to treat seborrhoeic dermatitis. We did not carry out this search because we lacked the resources. In the included studies, adverse effects that were reported were non-specific; therefore with hindsight, we believe that a search for specific adverse effects would have been difficult to perform. We also decided that searching grey literature and conference proceedings, as proposed in the protocol, would not yield extra information. The quality of reporting of published trials was already low, which made analysis difficult. Conference proceedings that were covered by the electronic search provided very little in terms of data, and we believe that it was not useful to further pursue this search approach.

Excluded studies

We decided to exclude studies in which antifungals were combined with other active medicines in the same treatment; this was not specified in the protocol. This decision was made when it became clear that with these combination treatments, treatment effect could not be attributed to the antifungal when in combination with an active agent of another class, or to a specific antifungal when in combination with another antifungal.

Interventions

We set out to include all interventions for seborrhoeic dermatitis but later reconsidered this proposal and rather split the review into two parts. This part is related only to topical antifungals.

Outcomes

We made some changes to the secondary outcome measures. Because we reasoned that global severity scores cannot be assessed in a valid way, we chose to drop the outcomes measures listed below.

Mean change in global severity score from baseline as assessed by the physician.
Mean change in global severity score from baseline as assessed by the participant.

We replaced these measures with severity scores for erythema, pruritus and scaling, which are cardinal symptoms of seborrhoeic dermatitis and unarguably the most investigated. We deemed these measures adequate to objectively capture treatment effect and enable comparisons across trials when they were derived on different scales. This decision was made after due consultation with experts in this field, including the Co-ordinating Editor of the Skin Group. The consultation was conducted to clarify which measure of treatment effect was objective enough to facilitate comparisons across studies. It was informed by the observation that global severity scores were measured on the basis of different combinations of affected areas of the skin and various possible symptoms. Thus we excluded studies that used only composite scores for treatment outcomes, as they did not all represent the same thing. Such studies are listed under the heading Excluded studies. Studies were included only if investigators had measured complete clearance of symptoms or a change in at least one of the cardinal symptoms of seborrhoeic dermatitis.

Subgroup analysis

In the review we added conflicts of interest to the parameters on which we based our subgroup analysis.

Searches

In the protocol in error, we omitted that we planned to search LILACS, which is an important source of records from South America; therefore we searched this database for this review.

GRADE

Within the time period that we needed to complete the review, assessing quality of evidence using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach became established practice. Therefore, we used GRADE to assess the quality of evidence, and we prepared 'Summary of findings' tables. These were not specified in the protocol.

Sensitivity analysis

We proposed to conduct a sensitivity analysis based on the presence of co-morbidities such as HIV, participants' use of drugs other than prescriptions for seborrhoeic dermatitis and the professional cadre of the diagnostician. Only one study recruited participants who also had HIV infection. Most studies included use of other drugs as an exclusion criterion. Very few studies have identified the cadre of the care provider who made the diagnosis. We therefore dropped these original criteria for these reasons.

Data synthesis

We pooled risk ratios for studies with dichotomous outcomes and mean differences or, when appropriate, standardised mean differences for studies with continuous outcomes using their weighted average for treatment effect as implemented in the RevMan software (RevMan). When heterogeneity was greater than 50%, we used a random-effects model. When heterogeneity was severe - I² statistic greater than 80% - we did not perform a meta-analysis but reported individual study results separately.

Grade

We used the programme GRADEPro to assess the quality of evidence across studies and to generate 'Summary of findings' tables for the most important comparisons that included a relevant number of studies. We started at a high level of quality because we included only randomised studies. We then used limitations in study design, consistency of results, directness, precision and publication bias to determine whether this should be downgraded by one or more levels. We reported our reasons for doing so as footnotes in the 'Summary of findings' table and in Table 1. We considered the study design to have limitations when most of the studies in a comparison had unclear or high risk of bias for randomisation, unclear allocation concealment or blinding of outcome assessment.

Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity

We planned to perform a subgroup analysis among HIV-positive participants with seborrhoeic dermatitis, but only one study included patients with HIV.

We conducted subgroup analyses based on conflicts of interest, dose and mode of delivery. These subgroup analyses were not planned in the protocol. Trial results were not presented in such a way as to allow subgroup analysis based on age, sex or presence of co-morbidity (significant co-morbidity was an exclusion criterion in many trials), as we had intended to do. Study factors (i.e. quality, design) that we had proposed as a basis for subgroup analysis were used instead for sensitivity analysis.

Sensitivity analysis

We attempted to carry out a sensitivity analysis by excluding studies that we judged to have high risk of bias based on inadequate randomisation, allocation concealment or absence of blinding. However, we found too few studies on subgroup categorisation to effectively perform this. We deemed exclusion on the basis of accuracy of diagnosis (as stated in the protocol) as not worthwhile because most trials did not explicitly state whether the diagnosis was made by a physician. We dropped other criteria as stated in the protocol because they were not feasible (see Differences between protocol and review).

### Diagnosis and treatment of seborrheic dermatitis [^28183cb5]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Seborrheic dermatitis is a common skin condition in infants, adolescents, and adults. The characteristic symptoms-scaling, erythema, and itching-occur most often on the scalp, face, chest, back, axilla, and groin. Seborrheic dermatitis is a clinical diagnosis based on the location and appearance of the lesions. The skin changes are thought to result from an inflammatory response to a common skin organism, Malassezia yeast. Treatment with antifungal agents such as topical ketoconazole is the mainstay of therapy for seborrheic dermatitis of the face and body. Because of possible adverse effects, anti-inflammatory agents such as topical corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors should be used only for short durations. Several over-the-counter shampoos are available for treatment of seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp, and patients should be directed to initiate therapy with one of these agents. Antifungal shampoos (long-term) and topical corticosteroids (short-term) can be used as second-line agents for treatment of scalp seborrheic dermatitis.

### Topical treatment of facial seborrheic dermatitis: a systematic review [^65cd361d]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Facial seborrheic dermatitis (SD), a chronic inflammatory skin condition, can impact quality of life, and relapses can be frequent. Three broad categories of agents are used to treat SD: antifungal agents, keratolytics, and corticosteroids. Topical therapies are the first line of defense in treating this condition.

Objective

Our objective was to critically review the published literature on topical treatments for facial SD.

Methods

We searched PubMed, Scopus, Clinicaltrials.gov, MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane library databases for original clinical studies evaluating topical treatments for SD. We then conducted both a critical analysis of the selected studies by grading the evidence and a qualitative comparison of results among and within studies.

Results

A total of 32 studies were eligible for inclusion, encompassing 18 topical treatments for facial SD. Pimecrolimus, the focus of seven of the 32 eligible studies, was the most commonly studied topical treatment.

Conclusion

Promiseb ®, desonide, mometasone furoate, and pimecrolimus were found to be effective topical treatments for facial SD, as they had the lowest recurrence rate, highest clearance rate, and the lowest severity scores (e.g., erythema, scaling, and pruritus), respectively. Ciclopirox olamine, ketoconazole, lithium (gluconate and succinate), and tacrolimus are also strongly recommended (level A recommendations) topical treatments for facial SD, as they are consistently effective across high-quality trials (randomized controlled trials).

### Unmet needs for patients with seborrheic dermatitis [^a6cbde4e]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Seborrheic dermatitis (SD) is a common skin disease with signs and symptoms that may vary by skin color, associated medical conditions, environmental factors, and vehicle preference. Diagnosis of SD is based on presence of flaky, "greasy" patches, and/or thin plaques accompanied by erythema of the scalp, face, ears, chest, and groin and is associated with pruritus in many patients. The presentation may vary in different skin types and hyper- or hypopigmentation may occur, with or without erythema and minimal or no scaling. While the pathogenesis is not certain, 3 key factors generally agreed upon include lipid secretion by sebaceous glands, Malassezia spp. colonization, and some form of immunologic dysregulation that predisposes the patient to SD. Treatment involves reducing proliferation of, and inflammatory response to, Malassezia spp. Topical therapies, including antifungal agents and low potency corticosteroids, are the mainstay of treatment but may be limited by efficacy and side effects. Few novel treatments for SD are currently being studied; however, clinical trials assessing the use of topical phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors have been completed. Improving outcomes in SD requires recognizing patient-specific manifestations/locations of the disease, including increased awareness of how it affects people of all skin types.

### Evidence-based answer… [^e7c00045]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

Clinical Question What is the most effective topical medication for adults with seborrheic dermatitis of the face or scalp. Evidence-Based Answer Steroids and antifungal agents can be used to effectively treat seborrheic dermatitis. Calcineurin inhibitors are as effective as steroids, but have a higher incidence of short-term adverse effects. Evidence Summary A systematic review compared topical therapies for seborrheic dermatitis in patients older than 16 years. 1 Three trials comparing potent and mild steroids found that they were more effective than placebo for total clearance of skin lesions with short-term treatment and long-term treatment.

The following drug classes were equally effective in achieving total clearance: potent vs. mild steroids, steroids vs. azoles, and steroids vs. calcineurin inhibitors. The most common adverse effects in all treatment groups were redness, burning, and itching at the application site. The only significant difference in adverse effects occurred with short-term use of steroids vs. calcineurin inhibitors; steroids were 78% less likely to cause adverse effects. Another systematic review compared the clinical effectiveness of three topical antifungals with placebo in treating seborrheic dermatitis in patients 15 to 78 years of age. 2 After four to eight weeks of treatment, there was significant improvement with all three antifungals compared with placebo.

Limitations of this review include poor-quality trials with marked heterogeneity, as well as lack of head-to-head trials. Copyright Family Physicians Inquiries Network. Used with permission.

### Topical antifungals for seborrhoeic dermatitis [^0f37c375]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Methods

Criteria for considering studies for this review

Types of studies

We included randomised controlled trials (including cross-over trials and cross-over trials of body parts) of antifungal agents for seborrhoeic dermatitis.

Types of participants

We included studies conducted with adults or adolescents who had been diagnosed by a healthcare practitioner, as explicitly stated or implied within context, as having seborrhoeic dermatitis (SD) of the scalp, face or both based on clinical case definition, with or without laboratory confirmation. The term 'healthcare practitioner' as used implies physicians or another cadre of care providers who used well-defined guidelines for making the diagnosis. We included studies that had described the diagnosis as seborrhoeic eczema or seborrhoeic dermatitis. No consensus has been reached on the difference between seborrhoeic dermatitis of the scalp and dandruff, which are seen by many as part of a continuous spectrum of dermatitis of the scalp. Therefore, we also included studies with patients who were diagnosed with dandruff.

### Topical antifungals for seborrhoeic dermatitis [^b8b30066]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Why it is important to do this review

The high global prevalence of seborrhoeic dermatitis, its explosive incidence rate in HIV/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and its chronic course justify further research with the purpose of finding treatment options targeted to achieve effective control. Physicians are inclined to use different treatment regimens for management, and in some instances the long course of therapy may erode patient compliance. Furthermore, almost all treatments aim to obtain but not to maintain remission. Long-term control of the disease should be attainable.

A systematic review of current treatment options is the best means to explore evidence on efficacy and appropriateness of treatment. This review focuses on antifungal treatments and was originally published as the protocol 'Interventions for seborrhoeic dermatitis'. This topic was subsequently split into two reviews: 'Topical antifungals for seborrhoeic dermatitis' and 'Topical anti-inflammatory agents for seborrhoeic dermatitis'. The latter was published as a separate protocol in 2011 and later as a review (Kastarinen). We are also aware of a related Cochrane review on infantile seborrhoeic dermatitis (including cradle cap) that is in preparation (Victoire).

### Seborrhoeic dermatitis [^d951ef20]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2010). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Seborrhoeic dermatitis affects at least 10% of the population. Malassezia (Pityrosporum) ovale is thought to be the causative organism, and causes inflammation by still poorly defined mechanisms. Seborrhoeic dermatitis tends to relapse after treatment.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of topical treatments for seborrhoeic dermatitis of the scalp in adults? What are the effects of topical treatments for seborrhoeic dermatitis of the face and body in adults? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to April 2010 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 12 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: bifonazole, emollients, ketoconazole, lithium succinate, selenium sulphide, tar shampoo, terbinafine, and topical corticosteroids (betamethasone valerate, clobetasol propionate, clobetasone butyrate, hydrocortisone, mometasone furoate).

### Seborrheic dermatitis [^c43b0dcb]. Dermatologic Clinics (2003). Low credibility.

Seborrheic dermatitis is present in 1% to 3% of immunocompetent adults, and is more prevalent in men than in women. Seborrheic dermatitis may be seen in conjunction with other skin diseases, such as rosacea, blepharitis or ocular rosacea, and acne vulgaris. Malassezia yeasts have been associated with seborrheic dermatitis. Abnormal or inflammatory immune system reactions to these yeasts may be related to development of seborrheic dermatitis. Treatment modalities for seborrheic dermatitis include keratolytic agents, corticosteroids, and more recently, antifungal agents. Antifungal agents do not carry a risk of skin atrophy or telangiectasia with prolonged use, and it is more prudent to consider antifungals than corticosteroid preparations. The wide range of antifungal formulations available (creams, shampoos, or oral) provides safe, effective, and flexible treatment options for seborrheic dermatitis.

### Diagnosis and management of common dermatoses in children: atopic, seborrheic, and contact dermatitis [^86de1824]. Clinical Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Atopic, seborrheic, and contact dermatitis can significantly reduce the quality of life of patients and their families. Although differing in specific aspects of their epidemiology, etiology, and pathobiology, all 3 dermatoses are common in the pediatric population, and they share a common treatment approach. Although effective and widely used to manage exacerbations of pediatric dermatitis, the use of topical corticosteroid remains a concern for some physicians and parents because of its potential for systemic absorption and adverse events associated with prolonged use. Newer additions to the dermatitis treatment algorithm, such as the topical calcineurin inhibitors, may provide an effective steroid-sparing treatment option. Adjuvant treatments, such as antihistamines, antifungals, and antibiotics, also can provide benefit in appropriate circumstances. As there is no cure for dermatitis, a comprehensive, multipronged management strategy of preventive measures, such as trigger avoidance and periodic pharmacologic treatment, will provide patients and caregivers with the best opportunity to successfully control the disease.

### Seborrhoeic dermatitis [^8cd4933b]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2007). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Seborrhoeic dermatitis affects at least 1–3% of the population. Malassezia (Pityrosporum) ovale is thought to be the causative organism, and causes inflammation involving T cells and complement. Seborrhoeic dermatitis tends to relapse after treatment.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of topical treatments for seborrhoeic dermatitis of the scalp in adults? What are the effects of topical treatments for seborrhoeic dermatitis of the face and body in adults? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to February 2006 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found nine systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: bifonazole, emollients, ketoconazole, lithium succinate, selenium sulphide, tar shampoo, terbinafine, and topical steroids (betamethasone valerate, clobetasol propionate, clobetasone butyrate, hydrocortisone, mometasone furate).

### Topical antifungals for seborrhoeic dermatitis [^b5783a9f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Types of interventions

We included studies that had evaluated the effectiveness of topical antifungal drugs for seborrhoeic dermatitis, as well as studies that had compared interventions according to either of the following two schedules.

Any topical antifungal-based treatment versus no treatment or placebo.
Any topical antifungal-based treatment versus another treatment.

We defined antifungal drugs as drugs with an established antifungal mode of action. According to Gupta, this included the following drug classes.

Imidazoles: bifonazole, climbazole, ketoconazole, miconazole.
Triazoles: fluconazole.
Allylamines: terbinafine.
Benzylamines: butenafine.
Hydroxypyrones: ciclopirox.

We found no consensus among study authors on how antifungal drugs were defined for use in trials. Therefore we included all studies in which study authors presented evidence that the drug had antifungal properties. We also included two herbal treatments with documented antifungal properties.

We excluded studies or treatment arms of studies that used a combination of antifungals and other drugs as the intervention, such as a combination of antifungals and steroids, because it would be unclear which of the active agents accounts for a given outcome and to what extent.

For topical applications, it is difficult to capture dose, as it is unclear how much a patient will need to apply to the skin. The only information available in studies was the strength of the drug given as a percentage and the frequency of application per day and per week. To calculate a dose that is comparable across studies, we multiplied the percentage by the frequency per day by the frequency per week. For example, 2% ketoconazole applied twice daily seven days a week would add up to 28 percentage points per week (%/wk).

Types of outcome measures

Primary outcomes

Percentage of persons who had clinical resolution (clearance) of all symptoms based on physician assessment.
Quality of life measured with any validated quality of life assessment index.

Secondary outcomes

Symptom severity scores for erythema, pruritus and scaling, measured with any type of systematic symptom severity assessment.
Side effects/intolerance to treatment.
Percentage of persons treated who comply with treatment regimens.
The longest rash-free period.

Timing of outcomes

Treatment effects were measured and combined at:

four weeks or less following commencement of treatment (short-term); and
more than four weeks following commencement of treatment (long-term).

### Topical anti-inflammatory agents for seborrheic dermatitis of the face or scalp: summary of a cochrane review [^ec624425]. JAMA Dermatology (2015). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question

Are there differences in effectiveness between topical anti-inflammatory treatments (steroids, calcineurin inhibitors, or lithium salts) and placebo or azoles in the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis of the face and scalp in adults?

Bottom Line

The topical anti-inflammatory treatments were more effective in achieving total clearance of symptoms than placebo by 1.4-fold to 8.5-fold, but there are no considerable differences in the anti-inflammatory topical treatments or in comparison with azoles for short-term treatment. There is no evidence of treatment effects in long-term, continuous, or intermittent use of these compounds despite the chronic nature of the disease.

We checked the bibliographies of published studies for further references to potentially relevant trials.

Data collection and analysis

Selection of studies

Five review authors (EOO, JHV, JHR, OAO and VNB) working in independent pairs screened titles and abstracts of references to identify studies presented as RCTs or controlled trials. We further retrieved full-text articles of such references and ran in-depth checks on study methodology to support our decision on which to include. To ensure that the study selection process was systematic, we developed and used a study selection form that operationalised the inclusion and exclusion criteria. We discussed conflicts between pairs of review authors to resolve them, and when no consensus was reached, a third review author from another pair arbitrated. The same pair of review authors assessed studies for risk of bias with recourse to a third review author when conflicts arose. JHV, JHR and colleagues within The Cochrane Collaboration (see Acknowledgements) translated studies published in languages other than English.

### Treating seborrheic dermatitis: review of mechanisms and therapeutic options [^c0a80432]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Seborrheic dermatitis is one of those conditions that dermatologists and patients alike tend to find a routine for, and in many cases those routines are hard to break. And, unlike the new treatment paradigms for eczema, acne, and even actinic keratoses, combination therapies for addressing the disease process typically have not been a part of the approach to treating seborrheic dermatitis. However, with the advent of new therapies and vehicles as well as a better understanding of how neutrophils and free oxygen radicals impact inflammation,1 there are new options to maintain and control the disease process of seborrheic dermatitis to minimize flares. Although the needs of the scalp, face and chest are different, as are the variations in skin types, the fundamental mechanisms of the inflammatory process are often the same. If it is understood that seborrheic dermatitis is histologically classified as a papulosquamous disorder with paucineutrophilic and lymphocytic infiltrates, and if the trigger and etiologic agent most likely is Malassezia furfur, then the ideal mechanisms of action of therapies should be directed as such

### Seborrheic dermatitis: diagnosis and treatment [^156052d5]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Seborrheic dermatitis is a common, chronic relapsing skin condition that predominantly affects areas of the body that are rich in sebaceous glands. Clinically, seborrheic dermatitis presents as symmetric, poorly defined erythematous patches with yellow, oily scales and fine, superficial desquamation (flaking). In people who have darker skin, erythema may be less apparent, and postinflammatory pigmentary changes might be a presenting sign with hypopigmented, slightly scaly areas. Seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp can be effectively treated with topical over-the-counter antifungal shampoos and prescription-strength antifungal or corticosteroid solutions, foams, or oils. Thick, scaly areas can be treated with keratolytic shampoos and lotions. Seborrheic dermatitis of the face and body can be treated with over-the-counter and prescription-strength antifungal creams, over-the-counter and prescription-strength corticosteroid creams and ointments, and calcineurin inhibitor cream or ointment. Neonatal seborrheic dermatitis is common and typically self-resolves by 6 months of age. Mild cases of the scalp (cradle cap) may be treated conservatively with mineral oil to loosen scale and gentle combing. More severe cases may overlap with atopic dermatitis and can be treated with topical antifungals or topical corticosteroids.

Sensitivity analyses

We considered two comparisons to contain sufficient studies for sensitivity analysis, namely, 'ketoconazole versus placebo' and 'ketoconazole versus steroids'. We intended to analyse differences in outcomes by conducting adequate randomisation, allocation concealment and blinding. However for these two comparisons, we found no study or at most two studies that had low risk of bias for these domains. We therefore refrained from drawing conclusions regarding the influence of risk of bias on review results.

Publication bias

Funnel plots for the main comparisons that included sufficient studies for assessment did not reveal a strong indication of publication bias (figure 4).

Funnel plot of comparison: 1 Ketoconazole vs placebo, outcome: 1.1 Failure to achieve complete resolution.

Grading of the evidence

Only one study had no limitations regarding randomisation, allocation concealment and blinding of the outcome assessor (Dreno). Therefore we downgraded the evidence for all comparisons on the basis of limitations in study design. For further downgrading decisions, see Table 1.

### Seborrheic dermatitis: etiology, risk factors, and treatments: facts and controversies [^d558c588]. Clinics in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Seborrheic dermatitis (SD) is a common skin condition seen frequently in clinical practice. The use of varying terms such as sebopsoriasis, seborrheic dermatitis, seborrheic eczema, dandruff, and pityriasis capitis reflects the complex nature of this condition. Despite its frequency, much controversy remains regarding the pathogenesis of SD. This controversy extends to its classification in the spectrum of cutaneous diseases, having being classified as a form of dermatitis, a fungal disease, or an inflammatory disease, closely related with psoriasis. Some have postulated that SD is caused by Malassezia yeasts, based on the observation of their presence in affected skin and the therapeutic response to antifungal agents. Others have proposed that Malassezia is incidental to a primary inflammatory dermatosis that resulted in increased cell turnover, scaling, and inflammation in the epidermis, similar to psoriasis. The presence of host susceptibility factors, permitting the transition of M furfur to its pathogenic form, may be associated with immune response and inflammation. Metabolites produced by Malassezia species, including oleic acid, malssezin, and indole-3-carbaldehyde, have been implicated. SD also has been traditionally considered to be a form of dermatitis based on the presence of Malassezia in healthy skin, the absence the pathogenic mycelial form of Malassezia yeasts in SD, and its chronic course. As a result, proposed treatments vary, ranging from topical corticosteroids to topical antifungals and antimicrobial peptides.

Data extraction and management

We developed a detailed data extraction form and tested it on a subset of the included studies to ascertain its adequacy and useability. We made the necessary modifications before using the form to extract data from identified studies. EOO, JHV, JHR, OAO and VNB extracted data. We used the same review author pairing approach for data extraction that we had used for study selection. Whenever a pair of review authors produced discrepancies, one of the other review authors resolved them. EOO entered the data into RevMan, and JHV checked that they were correct.

Assessment of risk of bias in included studies

Assessment of risk of bias consisted of an evaluation of the following components for each included study, using the criteria outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins).

Method of generating randomisation sequence - We considered this adequate if a proper randomisation method such as a table of random numbers or a computer programme had been used. The randomisation sequence had to be generated away from the actual trial site.
Method of allocation concealment - We considered this adequate if the assignment could not be foreseen by trial participants or investigators, for example, through the use of identical bottles with codes that were indecipherable to both participants and investigators.
Blinding - We considered whether participants, care providers and outcome assessors were adequately blinded as to who received the intervention and who received placebo.
Avoidance of co-interventions - We assessed whether co-interventions were avoided or similar between comparison groups. This was not prespecified in the protocol.
Drop-out rate - We considered loss of 20% or less of trial participants, comparable among groups, as non-systematic and therefore not likely to bias results. This was not prespecified in the protocol.
Intention-to-treat analysis - We assessed whether participants were analysed in the groups to which they were originally randomly assigned.
Selective outcome reporting - If a protocol was available, we checked whether outcomes were reported as proposed in the protocol and adequately; if no protocol was available, we checked whether outcomes were adequately reported and were consistent with those proposed in the Methods section of the article. This was not prespecified in the protocol.
Baseline imbalance among participants - We assessed whether participants in the intervention and control groups suffered from seborrhoeic dermatitis to a similar degree, or if a considerable difference was obvious.
Compliance - We checked whether participants in intervention and control groups complied with their drug regimen over an equal duration. This was not prespecified in the protocol.

### An open pilot study using tacrolimus ointment in the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis [^251bbd93]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Seborrheic dermatitis is generally treated with topical steroids, antifungals, or both. This pilot study was undertaken to examine the possibility of tacrolimus as a useful therapy for seborrheic dermatitis. In a single-center, open-label study, 18 consecutive patients with seborrheic dermatitis were treated with 0.1% tacrolimus for a total of 28 days or until complete clearance occurred, if sooner. Of the patients, 11 (61%) showed 100% clearance of their seborrheic dermatitis; the remaining 7 patients showed 70% to 99% clearance. The most common side effects were mild local burning and irritation.

### Topical anti-inflammatory agents for seborrhoeic dermatitis of the face or scalp [^acc32db8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Seborrhoeic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder affecting primarily the skin of the scalp, face, chest, and intertriginous areas, causing scaling and redness of the skin. Current treatment options include antifungal, anti-inflammatory, and keratolytic agents, as well as phototherapy.

Objectives

To assess the effects of topical pharmacological interventions with established anti-inflammatory action for seborrhoeic dermatitis occurring in adolescents and adults.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to September 2013: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library (2013, Issue 9), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), LILACS (from 1982), and the GREAT database. We searched five trials databases and checked the reference lists of included studies for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs).

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs in adults or adolescents (> 16 years) with diagnosed seborrhoeic dermatitis of the scalp or face, comparing topical anti-inflammatory treatments (steroids, calcineurin inhibitors, and lithium salts) with other treatments.

Data Collection and Analysis

Pairs of authors independently assessed eligibility for inclusion, extracted data, and evaluated the risk of bias. We performed meta-analyses if feasible.

Main Results

We included 36 RCTs (2706 participants), of which 31 examined topical steroids; seven, calcineurin inhibitors; and three, lithium salts. The comparative interventions included placebo, azoles, calcipotriol, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory compound, and zinc, as well as different anti-inflammatory treatments compared against each other. Our outcomes of interest were total clearance of symptoms, erythema, scaling or pruritus scores, and adverse effects. The risk of bias in studies was most frequently classified as unclear, due to unclear reporting of methods. Steroid treatment resulted in total clearance more often than placebo in short-term trials (four weeks or less) (relative risk (RR) 3.76, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.22 to 11.56, three RCTs, 313 participants) and in one long-term trial (lasting 12 weeks). Steroids were also more effective in reducing erythema, scaling, and pruritus. Adverse effects were similar in both groups. There may be no difference between steroids and calcineurin inhibitors in total clearance in the short-term (RR 1.08, 95% 0.88 to 1.32, two RCTs, 60 participants, low-quality evidence). Steroids and calcineurin inhibitors were found comparable in all other assessed efficacy outcomes as well (five RCTs, 237 participants). Adverse events were less common in the steroid group compared with the calcineurin group in the short-term (RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.89, two RCTs, 60 participants). There were comparable rates of total clearance in the steroid and azole groups (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.32, eight RCTs, 464 participants, moderate-quality evidence) as well as of adverse effects in the short-term, but less erythema or scaling with steroids. We found mild (class I and II) and strong (class III and IV) steroids comparable in the assessed outcomes, including adverse events. The only exception was total clearance in long-term use, which occurred more often with a mild steroid (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.98, one RCT, 117 participants, low-quality evidence). In one study, calcineurin inhibitor was more effective than placebo in reducing erythema and scaling, but there were similar rates in total clearance or adverse events for short-term treatment. In another study, calcineurin inhibitor was comparable with azole when erythema, scaling, or adverse effects were measured for longer-term treatment. Lithium was more effective than placebo with regard to total clearance (RR 8.59, 95% CI 2.08 to 35.52, one RCT, 129 participants) with a comparable safety profile. Compared with azole, lithium resulted in total clearance more often (RR 1.79, 95% CI 1.10 to 2.90 in short-term treatment, one RCT, 288 participants, low-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Topical steroids are an effective treatment for seborrhoeic dermatitis of the face and scalp in adolescents and adults, with no differences between mild and strong steroids in the short-term. There is some evidence of the benefit of topical calcineurin inhibitor or lithium salt treatment. Treatment with azoles seems as effective as steroids concerning short-term total clearance, but in other outcomes, strong steroids were more effective. Calcineurin inhibitor and azole treatment appeared comparable. Lithium salts were more effective than azoles in producing total clearance. Steroids are similarly effective to calcineurin inhibitors but with less adverse effects. Most of the included studies were small and short, lasting four weeks or less. Future trials should be appropriately blinded; include more than 200 to 300 participants; and compare steroids to calcineurin inhibitors or lithium salts, and calcineurin inhibitors to azoles or lithium salts. The follow-up time should be at least one year, and quality of life should be addressed. There is also a need for the development of well-validated outcome measures.

### Role of topical calcineurin inhibitors in the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis: a review of pathophysiology, safety, and efficacy [^171d0edf]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Seborrheic dermatitis (SD) is characterized by erythematous pruritic patches and plaques with greasy scale that occur in sebaceous areas. It is common, affecting up to 3% of the population. Past treatments have relied on a wide variety of anti-inflammatory and antifungal agents, but corticosteroids have limited use because of long-term adverse effects. Topical calcineurin inhibitors provide a safe alternative for the treatment of SD, as these drugs block the inflammatory cascade involved in the disease process and pose no risk of skin atrophy. Studies of topical pimecrolimus and tacrolimus in the treatment of SD have found that improvement occurred within 2 weeks, and if SD recurred after stopping treatment, it was significantly less severe. There have been no studies of the comparative efficacy of pimecrolimus versus tacrolimus for the treatment of SD. Common adverse effects of mild burning and irritation have been associated with the use of both of these agents. Safety profile studies are limited to studies of atopic dermatitis, which show no increase in infection rate, photocarcinogenicity, or signs of immunosuppression in patients using topical calcineurin inhibitors for long-term treatment. This article reviews the clinical trials of pimecrolimus and tacrolimus in the treatment of SD, focusing on efficacy and safety.

### Seborrheic dermatitis: an overview [^0a08cefe]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Seborrheic dermatitis affects the scalp, central face, and anterior chest. In adolescents and adults, it often presents as scalp scaling (dandruff). Seborrheic dermatitis also may cause mild to marked erythema of the nasolabial fold, often with scaling. Stress can cause flare-ups. The scales are greasy, not dry, as commonly thought. An uncommon generalized form in infants may be linked to immunodeficiencies. Topical therapy primarily consists of antifungal agents and low-potency steroids. New topical calcineurin inhibitors (immunomodulators) sometimes are administered.

### An up-to-date approach to the management of seborrheic dermatitis [^1f144956]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Seborrheic dermatitis (SD) is a chronic, relapsing, inflammatory dermatosis with ambiguous pathophysiology of overcolonization of Malassezia combined with predisposing factors including sebocyte activity, impaired immunity with diminished T-cell responses and activation of complements, disruption of epidermal barrier integrity and skin microbiota, and environmental influences.

### Topical antifungals for seborrhoeic dermatitis [^f79f5041]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Description of the intervention

Treatment for seborrhoeic dermatitis aims to do the following.

Achieve remission of rashes.
Eliminate itching and burning sensations.
Reduce the severity of rashes.
Prevent recurrence of rashes.

A variety of drug and non-drug treatments have been tried for seborrhoeic dermatitis. Antifungal and anti-inflammatory drugs are probably the most widely applied (Naldi). Various preparations are available for topical and oral application. Behavioural modifications such as frequent skin cleansing with soap, resolute commitment to personal hygiene and frequent outdoor recreation, especially in summer, have been found to lessen the symptoms (Johnson). Other therapeutic modalities include salicylic acid, zinc pyrithione and coal tar, which are applied topically and function to soften and remove the thick hardened crusts that sometimes occur in seborrhoeic dermatitis (Schwartz). Recalcitrant cases of this skin problem have been managed with phototherapy (i.e. ultraviolet B phototherapy) (Naldi), as well as with isotretinoin therapy, which reduces sebaceous gland size and consequently sebum secretion (Johnson).

In this review, we have focused on the more widespread topical application of topical antifungal agents such as ketoconazole, fluconazole and ciclopirox, which are available as ointments, creams, gels and shampoos (Gupta; Shuster).

How the intervention might work

Based on the concept that Malassezia yeasts are involved in the pathogenesis of seborrhoeic dermatitis, antifungals have long been proposed as treatment that confers the same benefits as steroids but lacks associated adverse effects (Gupta). Antifungals can lead to inhibition of fungal growth, mainly by interaction with the fungal cell membrane through inhibition of sterol synthesis or inhibition of the synthesis of cell walls (Kathiravan). In accordance with their chemical structure, antifungals are usually divided into azole-based antifungals such as ketoconazole, allylamines such as terbinafine, benzylamines such as butenafine and hydroxypyridones such as ciclopirox (Ghannoum). Other drugs such as selenium sulphide or herbal agents and natural products such as honey have also been shown to influence fungal growth, but their mechanism of action is not clear (Gupta). In this review, we have selectively included herbal extracts that have well-documented antifungal properties.

### Efficacy of oral fluconazole in the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis: a placebo-controlled study [^d80ac48e]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Seborrheic dermatitis (SD) is a common, chronic dermatosis. Although the pathogenetic mechanisms of SD are not clear, Malassezia spp. yeasts are known to cause the disease. Previous studies have shown that topical and systemic antifungals provide clinical benefit.

Objective

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of short-term oral fluconazole in patients with SD.

Methods

Sixty-three patients with mild-to-moderate SD were randomly allocated to receive either oral fluconazole 300 mg in a single dose per week or placebo, for 2 weeks. Twenty-seven patients taking fluconazole and 23 patients taking placebo completed the study and were analyzed. The SD area severity index (SDASI) score and the patient's subjective assessment of pruritus and burning sensation were evaluated before and after treatment. Both the investigator and the patients were blinded to treatment.

Results

A statistically significant improvement in SDASI score after treatment compared with baseline was obtained with fluconazole (p = 0.01) but not with placebo. However, the difference between the treatment groups was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). Subjective improvements in symptoms, such as pruritus and burning sensation, were observed in both groups but no statistically significant differences versus baseline were seen.

Conclusion

The results of this study indicate that fluconazole provides marginal and statistically insignificant benefit for the therapy of SD. However, larger studies using different dosages and/or durations of fluconazole therapy may provide a rationale for systemic use of fluconazole in SD.

### Seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp: etiology and treatment [^b0d74341]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Seborrheic dermatitis is a common chronic infection of the lipid-rich areas of skin. While seborrheic dermatitis has been a recognized clinical entity for decades, its etiology is far from clear. Early investigators of the development of seborrheic dermatitis focused on the role of the Malassezia (previously Pityrosporum) yeasts. These yeasts are also normal skin commensals, thus their importance as pathogens in this disorder came to be doubted. However, it was subsequently found that treatment of seborrheic dermatitis with an antifungal agent not only resulted in clinical improvement but also reduced the number of Malassezia yeasts on the skin. This has resulted in a resurgence of interest in the Malassezia yeasts. It has been hypothesized that there is an immunological component to seborrheic dermatitis, possibly representing an abnormal host response to the Malassezia yeasts. This paper will discuss the role of Malassezia in the etiology of seborrheic dermatitis, as well as the various treatment options.

### Efficacy and safety of a new once-daily topical ketoconazole 2% gel in the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis: a phase III trial [^e6ef3487]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The first gel formulation of ketoconazole has been tested in 2-week treatment courses.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of a new, once-daily, 2-week ketoconazole 2% gel treatment in moderate to severe seborrheic dermatitis.

Methods

Four hundred fifty-nine subjects with moderate to severe seborrheic dermatitis were randomized to receive ketoconazole 2% gel or vehicle gel once daily for 14 days. The primary efficacy was the proportion of successfully treated subjects at day 28 (cleared and almost cleared).

Results

A significantly greater percentage of subjects were successfully treated with ketoconazole 2% gel compared with vehicle (25.3% vs. 13.9%, P = 0.0014). Ketoconazole 2% gel improved erythema, scaling (P = 0.0022 vs. vehicle), and pruritus. Mean overall symptom severity was reduced by 53% and 39% with ketoconazole gel and vehicle, respectively. Adverse events were few, generally mild or moderate, and similar between treatment groups.

Conclusion

Once-daily ketoconazole 2% gel is an effective, well-tolerated, convenient, and cosmetically acceptable treatment for moderate to severe seborrheic dermatitis.

### Role of antifungal agents in the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis [^c2cd861e]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Seborrheic dermatitis is a superficial fungal disease of the skin, occurring in areas rich in sebaceous glands. It is thought that an association exists between Malassezia yeasts and seborrheic dermatitis. This may, in part, be due to an abnormal or inflammatory immune response to these yeasts. The azoles represent the largest class of antifungals used in the treatment of this disease to date. In addition to their antifungal properties, some azoles, including bifonazole, itraconazole, and ketoconazole, have demonstrated anti-inflammatory activity, which may be beneficial in alleviating symptoms. Other topical antifungal agents, such as the allylamines (terbinafine), benzylamines (butenafine), hydroxypyridones (ciclopirox), and immunomodulators (pimecrolimus and tacrolimus), have also been effective. In addition, recent studies have revealed that tea tree oil (Melaleuca oil), honey, and cinnamic acid have antifungal activity against Malassezia species, which may be of benefit in the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis. In cases where seborrheic dermatitis is widespread, the use of an oral therapy, such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, and terbinafine, may be preferred. Essentially, antifungal therapy reduces the number of yeasts on the skin, leading to an improvement in seborrheic dermatitis. With a wide availability of preparations, including creams, shampoos, and oral formulations, antifungal agents are safe and effective in the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis.

### Topical ruxolitinib in the treatment of refractory facial seborrheic dermatitis [^711a7a03]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Seborrheic dermatitis (SD) is a chronic, inflammatory skin condition that affects sebum-rich areas of the body. It is one of the most common skin diseases, with a prevalence of 14.3% in the middle-aged and elderly population.SD follows a relapsing and remitting course, worsening with stress and during the winter months. Importantly, SD has been reported to have a negative effect on quality of life. The underlying mechanism of SD is poorly understood; a combination of Malassezia species colonization, immune system activation, and genetic predisposition, among various other endogenous and exogenous factors, likely contribute to its pathogenesis. The clinical presentation ranges from simple dandruff to a fulminant rash. The diagnosis is made clinically by the presence of greasy yellow scales overlying well-demarcated erythematous patches or plaques affecting the face, scalp, and upper portion of the chest in a symmetric distribution; the hairline, eyebrows, glabella, and nasolabial folds are particularly involved. Facial SD is frequently associated with rosacea. The goal of therapy is to clear visible signs of disease and reduce associated symptoms and must be maintained long-term to prevent recurrence. Since the underlying mechanism involves, at least in part, Malassezia proliferation and inflammation, common treatments include antifungal and anti-inflammatory therapy. First-line therapy includes topical antifungals (eg, ketoconazole 2% cream) in combination with a mild topical corticosteroid (eg, hydrocortisone 2.5% or desonide 0.05% creams) or topical calcineurin inhibitor (eg, tacrolimus 0.1% ointment). With concomitant rosacea, metronidazole 1% gel or cream has been reported to help both conditions.

### Efficacy of roflumilast foam, 0.3%, in patients with seborrheic dermatitis: a double-blind, vehicle-controlled phase 2a randomized clinical trial [^6e9e3987]. JAMA Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Seborrheic dermatitis (SD) is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that affects patients of all ages, with a global prevalence of 5% or greater. Cardinal features are erythematous, scaly, pruritic patches and plaques, with a yellowish, greasy appearance, affecting areas with abundant sebaceous glands, often accompanied by dyspigmentation in patients with darker skin. Seborrheic dermatitis can have deleterious effects on quality of life, particularly in patients with more severe disease.

Treatment options for seborrheic dermatitis include topical antifungals, corticosteroids, and sulfur/sulfacetamide; topical calcineurin inhibitors are also used off label. Coal tar is less commonly used and is associated with safety concerns. Treatments are available as creams, lotions, ointments, foams, shampoos, gels, and solutions/topical suspensions. Corticosteroids are effective, but should not be used long term due to risk of atrophy, telangiectasia, acne, rosacea, and ocular toxic effects when used on the eyelid. Topical calcineurin inhibitors are not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to treat seborrheic dermatitis; however, efficacy and safety have been assessed in patients with severe facial seborrheic dermatitis. Topical calcineurin inhibitors are associated with short-term warmth and burning sensations, and labeling includes a warning for rare cases of lymphoma and skin cancer, although clinical data do not suggest higher risk compared with the general population. Scalp seborrheic dermatitis is often treated with shampoos containing antifungal agents, selenium sulfide, or zinc pyrithione. Nonpharmacologic treatments, such as prescription nonsteroidal medical device creams, may also be useful to treat erythema, scaling, and itching associated with seborrheic dermatitis.

### Facial seborrheic dermatitis: a report on current status and therapeutic horizons [^7901c324]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Seborrheic dermatitis, characterized by erythema and/or flaking or scaling in areas of high sebaceous activity, affects up to 5% of the US population and often appears in conjunction with other common skin disorders, such as rosacea and acne. Despite ongoing research, its etiology is puzzling. Increased sebaceous and hormonal (androgenic) activity is thought to play a part. Recent evidence suggests an important role for individual susceptibility to irritant metabolites of the skin commensal Malassezia, most probably M globosa. Current approaches thus include agents with antifungal as well as antikeratinizing, and anti-inflammatory activity. Azelaic acid, which has all 3 properties, may be a useful addition to first-line management, which now comprises of topical steroids, the immunosuppressant agents tacrolimus and pimecrolimus, azoles and other antifungals, and keratolytic agents. A recent exploratory study supports the efficacy and safety of azelaic acid 15% gel in seborrheic dermatitis. Azelaic acid may be especially valuable in this application because of its efficacy in treating concomitant rosacea and acne.

### Need for speed: topical roflumilast for rapid control of seborrheic dermatitis flares [^0ab677a3]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Seborrheic dermatitis is a common chronic inflammatory skin condition historically treated with topical antifungals and anti-inflammatory agents. While topical corticosteroids are frequently used to quickly control severe disease or flare-ups, efficacy is limited. Topical roflumilast 0.3% foam is the most recent treatment for seborrheic dermatitis approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA); however, its speed of action in controlling flares has not been fully explored. Herein, a case of severe seborrheic dermatitis with significant treatment response to topical roflumilast 0.3% cream, within 24 hours, is described, and the literature reviewed. This case suggests that topical roflumilast may work even faster than topical corticosteroids in controlling flares, and further investigation is warranted to thoroughly assess roflumilast's onset of action and leverage its clinical potential.

### Ketoconazole cream, 2% (ketoconazole) [^1b86c7d6]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Cutaneous candidiasis, tinea corporis, tinea cruris, tinea pedis, and tinea (pityriasis) versicolor: It is recommended that Ketoconazole Cream, 2% be applied once daily to cover the affected and immediate surrounding area. Clinical improvement may be seen fairly soon after treatment is begun; however, candidal infections and tinea cruris and corporis should be treated for two weeks in order to reduce thepossibility of recurrence. Patients with tinea versicolor usually require two weeks of treatment. Patients with tinea pedis require six weeks of treatment.

Seborrheic dermatitis: Ketoconazole cream, 2% should be applied to the affected area twice daily for four weeks or until no clinical clearing.

If a patient shows no clinical improvement after the treatment period, the diagnosis should be redetermined.

Recommendation 1 — good practice statement (atopic dermatitis): Clinicians managing all severities of atopic dermatitis (AD) should, before issuing any new therapy, ensure the correct diagnosis and identify complicating diagnoses, provide education (for instance an information guide and an action plan), address trigger avoidance, ensure proper medication use/adherence, and encourage application of a bland moisturizer titrated to symptomatic benefit (at least once, often multiple times, per day). Mimickers and complicating disorders are common and must be ruled out, including irritant and/or allergic contact dermatitis, psoriasis, seborrheic dermatitis, photodermatoses, primary immunodeficiency disorders, infestations (eg, scabies), and local and systemic infections (eg, Streptococcal, Staphylococcal, fungal, syphilis). Inborn errors of immunity or other rare syndromes should be considered in infants and young children with concerning constellations of signs and symptoms that should prompt referral, and venous stasis dermatitis and cutaneous lymphoma are more common in adults.

Secondary outcomes

Symptom severity scores for erythema, pruritus, scaling measured with any type of systematic symptom severity assessment

Erythema score

One study (Zienicke) assessed decreases in erythema in bifonazole and placebo groups on short-term (up to four weeks) application. No statistically significant difference was observed between groups (MD -0.13, 95% CI -0.42 to 0.16) (Analysis 14.3). Segalcompared groups on long-term (more than four weeks) treatment and found no statistically significant difference in erythema score (MD -0.50, 95% CI -1.04 to 0.04) (Analysis 14.4).

Pruritus score

Zienickefound that participants who received bifonazole experienced less itch than those receiving placebo, but the difference was not statistically significant (MD -0.21, 95% CI -0.51 to 0.09) (Analysis 14.5). Segalfound less itch with long-term (more than four weeks) use of bifonazole compared with placebo, and this finding was statistically significant (MD -0.85, 95% CI -1.39 to -0.31) (Analysis 14.6).

Scaling score

Participants who received bifonazole treatment for a short term (up to four weeks) (Zienicke) experienced less scaling than those given placebo (MD -0.32, 95% CI -0.59 to -0.05) (Analysis 14.7). A similar finding was reported in Segal, where, on long-term assessment, less scaling was seen in the bifonazole group as compared with the placebo group (MD -0.92, 95% CI -1.46 to -0.38) (Analysis 14.8). Differences between treatments in these studies were statistically significant.

Side effects/intolerance to treatment

Side effects

Two studies (Segal; Zienicke) recorded more side effects with bifonazole than with placebo (RR 2.19, 95% CI 0.75 to 6.37) (Analysis 14.9), but this finding was not statistically significant.

### An investigator-blind, randomized, 4-week, parallel-group, multicenter pilot study to compare the safety and efficacy of a nonsteroidal cream (promiseb topical cream) and desonide cream 0.05% in the twice-daily treatment of mild to moderate seborrheic dermatitis of the face [^c6b488bc]. Clinics in Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

The treatment of seborrheic dermatitis includes topical antifungal agents to eradicate Malassezia spp, corticosteroids, which treat the inflammatory component of the disease and keratolytics which remove scale and crust. This study compared the efficacy of a nonsteroidal topical cream and a low-potency topical corticosteroid for the treatment of mild to moderate seborrheic dermatitis of the face in 77 volunteers randomized to twice-daily treatment with nonsteroidal cream or corticosteroid cream for up to 28 days. If the individual was rated clear by day 14, the study drug was collected and the participant was told not to use any topical products on the previously treated areas until after the 28-day follow-up visit. Both treatments were similarly effective in reducing disease severity, with approximately 90% of participants clearing or almost clear during the study. Both treatments demonstrated significant reductions in erythema, scaling, and pruritus (P < .0001). Safety in both groups was rated as excellent in more than 90%. Those using the nonsteroidal cream who cleared after 14 days of treatment were more likely to remain clear than were participants using the corticosteroid cream (P = 0.0173). Investigator global assessments of improvement found both study agents were essentially the same, and participants in both groups achieved clinically important improvement.

### Non-steroidal topical therapy for facial seborrheic dermatitis [^48ba31d4]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Seborrheic dermatitis (SD) is a chronic, recurrent, inflammatory skin disorder occurring in areas rich in sebaceous glands. It manifests clinically as erythematous macules or plaques with varying levels of scaling and associated pruritus. Although the pathogenesis of SD has yet to be fully understood, Malassezia yeasts, hormones, sebum levels, and immune response are known to play important roles. Additional factors including drugs, winter temperatures, and stress may exacerbate SD. Current available treatments include antifungal agents, topical low-potency steroids, and calcineurin inhibitors. We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a topical non-steroidal cream in treating facial seborrheic dermatitis (FSD). We performed a case series of 11 patients with mild or moderate FSD and a history of several previous treatments without improvement. The patients were treated for 8 weeks with a topical non-steroidal facial cream (NSFC) containing zinc PCA, piroctone olamine, hydroxyphenyl propamidobenzoic acid, biosaccharide gum-2, and stearyl glycyrrhetinate. Signs and symptoms and tolerance were assessed before, during, and at the end of treatment. All of the patients had improved symptoms of FSD (desquamation, pruritus, erythema, and stinging sensation); 81.8% showed an excellent response and 18.1% showed a good response. None of the patients had adverse effects. J Drugs Dermatol. 2020;19(6): doi:10.36849/JDD.2020.5121.

### Exosome therapy for chronic severe seborrheic dermatitis: a case report [^c01bbc5d]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Seborrheic dermatitis (SD) is a common inflammatory skin condition marked by scaly, red lesions, typically in areas with high sebum production, such as the scalp, face, trunk, and skin folds.SD is a chronic, recurrent disease that can be well-controlled with available therapies but has no definitive cure. Initial treatments often include topical antifungals and corticosteroids; however, these frequently relapse and present adherence challenges, especially in severe or resistant cases. Prolonged corticosteroid use can also cause complications like skin thinning, perioral dermatitis, and telangiectasia. These issues drive the need for alternative therapies, with treatment typically based on SD severity. Mild-to-moderate cases are managed with topical corticosteroids, antifungals (eg, ciclopirox and ketoconazole), and keratolytics like propylene glycol. For facial and body areas, additional options include calcineurin inhibitors, clotrimazole, and lithium succinate. Severe or resistant cases may require systemic antifungals like terbinafine or itraconazole, and UV-B phototherapy.

Recent advancements such as exosome-based therapy have gained significant attention due to the natural, cell-derived characteristics of extracellular vesicles, particularly exosomes, which are lipid bilayer vesicles of 40–150 nm in size. Exosomes carry a range of biomolecules, such as proteins, lipids, RNA, and DNA, reflective of their parent cells, and play a crucial role in disease pathogenesis through intercellular signaling. It can be administered either topically or via injection, utilizing natural, engineered defense mechanisms to target diseases at the cellular level. It has shown effectiveness in managing chronic inflammatory skin conditions like bullous pemphigoid, systemic lupus erythematosus, and atopic dermatitis. This case report investigated the efficacy of adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cell exosome (ASCE) exosome therapy for treating SD.

### Treatment of seborrheic dermatitis… [^d07a4f15]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Why some persons develop seborrheic dermatitis and others do not is unclear. The colonization rate of involved skin by this organism may be lower than that of uninvolved skin. 3 Nonetheless, the fact that seborrheic dermatitis responds to antifungal medications is strongly suggestive of the role of yeast in this disorder. Topical corticosteroid solutions, lotions or ointments may be used once or twice daily for one to three weeks in place of the overnight application of fluocinolone acetonide and may be stopped when itching and erythema disappear. Corticosteroid application may be repeated daily for one to three weeks until itching and erythema disappear, and then used as needed. Maintenance with an antidandruff shampoo may then be adequate. Patients should be advised to use potent topical steroids sparingly because excessive use may lead to atrophy of the skin and telangiectasis. Other options include application of a moderate- to mid-potency topical corticosteroid in an ointment base.

As with other modes of therapy, these agents are used every day or twice daily until the condition improves. Thereafter, topical corticosteroids are used as needed to keep the condition under control. After initial control is attained, fluocinolone acetonide, 0. 01 percent shampoo, can be used as an alternative to or in addition to fluocinolone acetonide,
0. 01 percent in oil, for maintenance. A more practical approach to the refractory patient may be to first try different combinations of the usual agents: a dandruff shampoo, an antifungal agent and a topical steroid. If this fails, short-term use of a more potent topical steroid in a "pulse fashion" may put some refractory patients into remission and actually decrease the total steroid exposure. The class III topical steroid should be tried first, but if the condition remains unresponsive, the clinician may then choose to use a class I agent.

These more potent agents may be applied once or twice per day, even on the face, but must be stopped after two weeks because of the increased frequency of side effects. If the patient responds before the two-week limit, the agent should be stopped immediately. Adjuvant therapy including use of a dandruff shampoo, an anti-fungal agent, or both, is essential during the "pulse" period and should be continued as maintenance therapy after each pulse.

Previous studies have shown that topical steroid and shampoo containing zinc pyrithione provide clinical benefits for treatment of scalp seborrheic dermatitis. But the clinical efficacy of topical tacrolimus, a newly developed calcineurin inhibitor on seborrheic dermatitis, is not well investigated yet. We wanted to compare the clinical efficacy of topical tacrolimus with that of conventional treatment (zinc pyrithione shampoo and topical betamethasone) for treatment of seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp. Patients with seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp were randomly allocated to receive topical betamethasone, topical tacrolimus or zinc pyrithione shampoo. Some patients were instructed to continue the treatments for 8 weeks and the others to discontinue the treatments at week 4. We evaluated the efficacy using a clinical severity score, dandruff score and sebum secretion at baseline, week 4 and week 8. All treatment groups showed significant improvements in clinical assessment after 4 weeks. While the patients treated by zinc pyrithione improved continuously even after cessation of the treatment, the patients treated by betamethasone lotion or tacrolimus ointment were aggravated clinically. Topical tacrolimus was as effective as topical betamethasone, and showed more prolonged remission than topical betamethasone. To treat seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp, we think that the combination therapy of topical steroid or topical tacrolimus, and zinc pyrithione is recommended.

### Topical antifungals for seborrhoeic dermatitis [^85c1ee1c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Ketoconazole versus pimecrolimus

Koccompared ketoconazole versus pimecrolimus but did not report either of our primary outcomes.

Secondary outcomes

Symptom severity scores for erythema, pruritus, scaling measured with any type of systematic symptom severity assessment

Erythema score

One trial (Koc) assessed the long-term (more than four weeks) effect of ketoconazole application, in comparison with pimecrolimus, on erythema score. Ketoconazole led to a greater decrease in erythema, which was statistically significant (MD -0.30, 95% CI -0.58 to -0.02) (Analysis 8.1).

None of the included studies reported a pruritus score.

Scaling score

Koccompared the ability of ketoconazole to reduce scaling with long-term (more than four weeks) use versus that of pimecrolimus; no significant difference was observed between the two groups (MD -0.04, 95% CI -0.27 to 0.19) (Analysis 8.2).

Side effects/intolerance to treatment

Side effects

Kocfound ketoconazole to be more tolerable than pimecrolimus; statistically significantly fewer side effects were observed in the ketoconazole group (RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.82; NNTB 3, 95% CI 2 to 9) (Analysis 8.3).

Ketoconazole versus lithium

Primary outcome

Participants without complete resolution

Drenocompared effects of ketoconazole and lithium gluconate on facial seborrhoeic dermatitis. Of participants taking lithium, 73% did not achieve complete resolution compared with 85% of those taking ketoconazole who did not achieve complete resolution (RR 1.16, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.30; NNTB 9, 95% CI 42 to 5) (Analysis 9.1). Long-term (more than four weeks) outcome was also better with lithium gluconate (RR 1.47, 95% CI 1.21 to 1.78) (Analysis 9.2).

### Topical pimecrolimus 1% cream for resistant seborrheic dermatitis of the face: an open-label study [^6478fe02]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Treatment options for seborrheic dermatitis are numerous, including both topical and systemic agents (e.g. topical corticosteroids, oral antifungals, and psoralen plus UVA). However, long-term use of topical corticosteroids may lead to adverse effects. Pimecrolimus 1% cream is an effective and well tolerated treatment for seborrheic dermatitis.

Objective

To explore the efficacy of pimecrolimus 1% cream for the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis lesions resistant to conventional treatments.

Methods

Sixteen patients with resistant seborrheic dermatitis of the face applied pimecrolimus 1% cream twice daily for 2 weeks. The lesions were assessed clinically and the severity of the signs were assessed using a 4-point score. Additionally, the scores of all affected regions (paranasal, forehead, and eyebrows) were evaluated separately to assess whether different results would be obtained in different regions of the face. Also, patients completed self-assessments on a 100 mm Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) at each visit.

Results

Statistically significant reductions in the scores of all parameters were observed at day 7 and day 14 of the study. There were no significant differences between the responses on the three regions of the face. No adverse effects were reported except for temporary pruritus immediately after the application of pimecrolimus 1% cream in one patient.

Conclusion

Although the interpretation of efficacy was limited by the open-label, non-controlled study design and the small number of patients, this trial suggests that pimecrolimus 1% cream may be a successful treatment choice for patients with resistant seborrheic dermatitis of the face.

### An open-label, single-center pilot study to determine the antifungal activity of a new nonsteroidal cream (promiseb topical cream) after 7 days of use in healthy volunteers [^023f59f7]. Clinics in Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Topical corticosteroids are effective for the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis. The duration of treatment with mid- to high-potency formulations is limited by the well-known side effects associated with their long-term use; further, topical corticosteroids treat only the inflammation associated with the disease. This study assessed the antifungal activity of a new corticosteroid-free cream against Malassezia spp, which may be an important pathogenic factor in seborrheic dermatitis. This was a single-center, bilateral, open-label pilot study in 10 healthy volunteers. The nonsteroidal cream was applied twice daily to a designated target area on the chest for 7 days, and the number of colony-forming units of Malassezia spp taken by tape stripping after 7 days was compared with baseline. The percentage reduction from baseline to day 7 in the number of colony-forming units of Malassezia spp was 94% on the treated side versus 49% on the untreated side (P = 0.03). This pilot study shows the nonsteroidal topical cream has antifungal activities. Further exploration into its potential as a therapeutic alternative for seborrheic dermatitis is warranted.

### Single-blind, randomized controlled trial evaluating the treatment of facial seborrheic dermatitis with hydrocortisone 1% ointment compared with tacrolimus 0.1% ointment in adults [^00bcecc9]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Tacrolimus is a topical calcineurin inhibitor with immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and fungicidal properties that may be beneficial in the treatment of facial seborrheic dermatitis.

Objectives

We sought to compare the efficacy and safety of tacrolimus with standard corticosteroid treatment in adults with facial seborrheic dermatitis in a phase II, single-blind, randomized controlled trial.

Methods

Adult patients were enrolled in a 12-week study. Subjects were randomized to tacrolimus 0.1% ointment (n = 16) or hydrocortisone 1% ointment (n = 14) applied twice daily to symptomatic regions of the face. The primary efficacy measure was the severity of facial seborrhea at the end of treatment (day 84) as measured by the Seborrhea Area and Severity Index-Face. Secondary efficacy measures included physician and patient assessment of seborrhea, the frequency of medication application, and adverse events.

Results

The severity of facial seborrhea was similarly improved in both treatment groups (P = 0.86). Tacrolimus 0.1% ointment was used on significantly fewer days than 1% hydrocortisone ointment (mean missed doses per patient at first visit: 15.6 vs 7.6, P < .05; at last visit: 13.5 vs 7.7, P = 0.08). The majority of doses were missed because of lack of symptoms. The adverse event profile for both agents was similar; however, there was a numerically higher incidence of adverse events in the hydrocortisone group.

Limitations

This was a small, open-label study.

Conclusion

Tacrolimus 0.1% ointment required significantly fewer applications compared with hydrocortisone 1% ointment to achieve a comparable clinical response in adults with facial seborrheic dermatitis. Tacrolimus was generally well tolerated.

### Medicated shampoos for the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis [^c62342c0]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Seborrheic dermatitis is a common papulosquamous disorder of the skin, affecting 3% to 5% of the population. Dandruff, a less severe form of seborrheic dermatitis, affects a greater proportion of the population. The exact pathogenesis of seborrheic dermatitis is unknown, however colonization of the lipophilic yeast, Malasezzia furfur, and an inflammatory reaction to this yeast each seem to play a role in disease etiology. Therefore, treatment for seborrheic dermatitis is aimed at yeast elimination and inflammation control. Several treatment modalities are available for seborrheic dermatitis and dandruff including shampoos, which contain both active ingredients related to antimycotic or anti-inflammatory effects and also surfactant ingredients that allow these shampoos to replace regular shampoos in affected patients. The literature regarding the treatment of therapeutic shampoos is reviewed, and treatment strategies for managing seborrheic dermatitis with therapeutic shampoos are provided.

### Efficacy of roflumilast foam, 0.3%, in patients with seborrheic dermatitis: a double-blind, vehicle-controlled phase 2a randomized clinical trial [^dff9406b]. JAMA Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

Methods

Study Design

This was a parallel-group, double-blind, vehicle-controlled randomized clinical trial of once-daily roflumilast foam, 0.3%, for treatment of seborrheic dermatitis, conducted at 24 sites in the US and Canada. The study protocol and statistical analysis plans are in Supplements 1 and 2. Eligible patients were adults (aged ≥ 18 years) with clinical diagnosis of seborrheic dermatitis of a 3-month or greater duration, Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) score of 3 or greater, and affecting 20% or less body surface area (BSA), including the scalp, face, trunk, and/or intertriginous areas (eFigure 1 in Supplement 3). Patients had to discontinue topical antifungals, corticosteroids, topical calcineurin inhibitors, sulfur-based treatments, medical devices, crisaborole, azelaic acid, or metronidazole 2 or more weeks before randomization (additional excluded medications are in eTable 1 in Supplement 3). Nonmedicated emollients, moisturizers, and sunscreens were allowed once daily as normally used by patients and applied 3 or more hours after application of the investigational product to untreated areas only.

### Tinea capitis in an immigrant pediatric community; a clinical signs-based treatment approach [^1913dd6b]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Fig. 3
A. Percentage of the different types of dermatophyte fungi in culture among children with suspected tinea capitis. B. Percentage of the different types of dermatophyte fungi by host preference

Tinea capitis cases in children in this community prior to this study, were treated with griseofulvin as first-line therapy at a maximum dose of 25 mg/kg/day for 6–8 weeks, which induced a minimal response, if any. In order to eradicate and prevent spread of the infection, the recommended drug dose was gradually elevated to a dose of 50 mg/kg/day, for 6–8 weeks, which efficiently eradicated the infection. From then on, all children suspected to have Tinea capitis were treated with griseofulvin at this doubled dose.

During the study period, due to unavailability of griseofulvin for some time, 21 patients were treated with fluconazole, at a maximum dose of 7.5 mg/kg/day, for 4 weeks. None of these children showed a clinical response, even when the dose was raised to 10 mg/kg/day for 6 weeks. After the return of griseofulvin to the market, these children were treated with griseofulvin 50 mg/kg/day; clearance was achieved within 6 weeks in most cases, except for 3 children who required 8 weeks of treatment until the condition fully resolved.

Five children presented with kerion. In addition to antifungal treatment, they were treated with antibiotics and steroids. None required surgical intervention. Two children with both a negative culture and negative direct examination and suspected of having seborrheic dermatitis, were not treated empirically for Tinea capitis. Two other children with uncertainty regarding the possibility of Tinea capitis or seborrheic dermatitis diagnosis, were given empirical treatment, which was discontinued after receiving negative culture results.

Four children who showed no response to griseofulvin had a R. mucilaginosa -positive culture and were treated accordingly.

All children received topical treatment as adjunct therapy, as recommended, in order to reduce contagion. No clinical side effects or blood test abnormalities were observed in the participants during treatment. All treatments and responses are summarized in Table 4.

### Guidelines of care for the management of atopic dermatitis: section 1. diagnosis and assessment of atopic dermatitis [^51e87460]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis differential diagnosis and reassessment — AD should be differentiated from other red, scaly skin conditions, and it is often difficult to separate AD from seborrheic dermatitis in infancy, with overlap possible in this age group. AD usually spares the groin and axillary regions, while seborrheic dermatitis affects these areas and tends not to be pruritic. Particularly if not responding to therapy, the diagnosis of AD should be re-reviewed and other disorders considered, including more serious nutritional, metabolic, and immunologic conditions in children and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in adults. The original UK criteria cannot be applied to very young children, although revisions to include infants have since been proposed, and allergic contact dermatitis may be both an alternative diagnosis to AD and/or an exacerbator of AD in some individuals.

### Efficacious and safe management of moderate to severe scalp seborrhoeic dermatitis using clobetasol propionate shampoo 0.05% combined with ketoconazole shampoo 2%: a randomized, controlled study [^4015b690]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Topical antifungals and corticosteroids are the mainstay of treatment for seborrhoeic dermatitis. The short-contact clobetasol propionate 0·05% shampoo (CP) is an efficacious and safe once-daily treatment for scalp psoriasis.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of CP alone and combined with ketoconazole shampoo 2% (KC) in the treatment of moderate to severe scalp seborrhoeic dermatitis.

Methods

This randomized and investigator-blinded study consisted of three phases, each lasting 4 weeks. During the treatment phase, subjects were randomized to receive KC twice weekly (K2), CP twice weekly (C2), CP twice weekly alternating with KC twice weekly (C2 + K2) or CP four times weekly alternating with KC twice weekly (C4+K2). All subjects received KC once weekly during the maintenance phase and were untreated during the follow-up phase.

Results

At the end of the treatment phase, all three CP-containing regimens were significantly more efficacious than K2 in decreasing the overall disease severity (P < 0·05). Both combination regimens were also significantly more efficacious than K2 in decreasing each individual sign of the disease (P < 0·05). While the C2 and C4 + K2 groups experienced slight worsening during the maintenance phase, the efficacy of C2 + K2 was sustained and remained the highest among all groups. All regimens were well tolerated without inducing any skin atrophy. Similarly low incidences of telangiectasia, burning and adverse events were observed among the four groups.

Conclusions

The combination therapy of twice-weekly CP alternating with twice-weekly KC provided significantly greater efficacy than KC alone and a sustained effect in the treatment of moderate to severe scalp seborrhoeic dermatitis.

### Pilot trial of 1% pimecrolimus cream in the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis in African American adults with associated hypopigmentation [^9060e332]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

African Americans with seborrheic dermatitis may manifest associated hypopigmenation. Corticosteroids and antifungals are often used for treatment, yet chronic use of corticosteroids may be associated with skin atrophy, increased intraocular pressure, or further hypopigmenation. Pimecrolimus has been used successfully in a few patients with seborrheic dermatitis.

Objectives

This open-label, pilot trial assessed the efficacy and tolerability of pimecrolimus in the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis in African Americans with hypopigmentation.

Methods

Five African American adults with seborrheic dermatitis used a thin layer of pimecrolimus on the involved areas twice per day for 16 weeks. Clinical measures of improvement included erythema, scaling, and pruritus. Hypopigmentation was measured objectively using a mexameter.

Results

All participants noted a marked decrease in the severity of their condition. An improvement in hypopigmentation was also noted. For all indicators, the magnitude of improvement was most marked during the initial 2 weeks of treatment.

Limitations

This was an open-label pilot trial limited to just 6 participants, only 5 of whom completed the study.

Conclusions

Topical pimecrolimus cream may be an excellent alternative therapeutic modality for treating seborrheic dermatitis in African Americans, particularly in those with associated hypopigmentation.

### The evolving role of therapeutic shampoos for targeting symptoms of inflammatory scalp disorders [^8a54a734]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Scalp lesions are common among patients with psoriasis, seborrheic dermatitis and a number of other inflammatory and fungal conditions. Topical corticosteroids are a mainstay of treatment for many scalp dermatoses and they significantly reduce erythema, scaling and pruritus. Conventional corticosteroid formulations such as cream and ointments are often difficult or time consuming for patients to apply and may produce undesirable cosmetic effects. Medicated shampoos provide a more convenient alternative for patients who require topical administration of corticosteroids for scalp conditions. Tar shampoos have long been used to treat psoriasis and are effective for the long-term maintenance of remission in patients who respond to therapy. Antifungal shampoos are effective for the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis and other mycotic conditions. A shampoo formulation containing fluocinolone acetonide, 0.01% is also approved for the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis. One superpotent corticosteroid shampoo (clobetasol propionate 0.05%; Clobex Shampoo) is approved in the United States (U.S.) for once-daily treatment of psoriasis of the scalp. The results of a 2007 pilot study also demonstrated that clobetasol propionate shampoo improved the signs and symptoms of seborrheic dermatitis. These findings suggest that high-potency corticosteroid shampoos may provide an important option for topical corticosteroid therapy in dermatologic conditions affecting the scalp.

### Management of seborrheic dermatitis and pityriasis versicolor [^e7aa9a0f]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Pityriasis (tinea) versicolor and seborrheic dermatitis are two very common skin diseases. Pityriasis versicolor is a chronic superficial fungal disease usually located on the upper trunk, neck, or upper arms. In pityriasis versicolor, the lipophilic yeast Malassezia (also know as Pityrosporum ovale or P. orbiculare) changes from the blastospore form to the mycelial form under the influence of predisposing factors. The most important exogenous factors are high temperatures and a high relative humidity which probably explain why pityriasis versicolor is more common in the tropics. The most important endogenous factors are greasy skin, hyperhidrosis, hereditary factors, corticosteroid treatment and immunodeficiency. There are many ways of treating pityriasis versicolor topically. Options include propylene glycol, ketoconazole shampoo, zinc pyrithione shampoo, ciclopiroxamine, selenium sulfide, and topical antifungals. In difficult cases, short term treatment with fluconazole or itraconazole is effective and well tolerated. To avoid recurrence a prophylactic treatment regimen is mandatory. Seborrheic dermatitis is characterized by red scaly lesions predominantly located on the scalp, face and upper trunk. There are now many studies indicating that Malassezia plays an important role in this condition. Even a normal number of Malassezia will start an inflammatory reaction. Mild corticosteroids are effective in the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis. However, the disease recurs quickly, often within just a few days. Antifungal therapy is effective in the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis and, because it reduces the number of Malassezia, the time to recurrence is increased compared with treatment with corticosteroids. Antifungal therapy should be the primary treatment of this disease.

Seborrheic dermatitis of the face (A) before and (B) after ruxolitinib cream 1.5%.

Fig 2
Seborrheic dermatitis of the chest (A) before and (B) after ruxolitinib cream 1.5%.

The current mainstay of treatment for SD involves medicated shampoos, topical antifungals, and topical corticosteroids. Ruxolitinib is a selective Janus kinase (JAK)1/2 inhibitor whose topical formulation (ruxolitinib 1.5% cream) is approved for use in atopic dermatitis and nonsegmental vitiligo. JAK inhibitors disrupt cytokine and growth factor signaling pathways, generally leading to a decrease in the inflammatory response. A small previous study has shown that punch biopsy lesions from SD show an increase in various cytokines, including interleukin 4, when compared with healthy volunteers. In mice models of dermatitis, ruxolitinib cream use resulted in downregulation of proinflammatory genes, including the interleukin 4 receptor α chain. This may offer a mechanistic hypotesis for why topical ruxolitinib may be beneficial in SD in a similar manner to other inflammatory conditions, such as atopic dermatitis. We hope that these reports add to the body of evidence suggesting that topical JAK inhibitors may play a broader role in the treatment of common dermatologic conditions.

### Results of a randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled efficacy trial of pimecrolimus cream 1% for the treatment of moderate to severe facial seborrheic dermatitis [^b33cb9d2]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Seborrheic dermatitis is commonly treated with anti-inflammatory products, including topical corticosteroids. Pimecrolimus cream 1% also exerts anti-inflammatory activity by inhibiting T-cell cytokine production.

Objective

We sought to compare the efficacy and safety of twice-daily pimecrolimus for treatment of moderate to severe facial seborrheic dermatitis.

Methods

This double-blind, vehicle-controlled, 4-week trial randomized patients with seborrheic dermatitis to pimecrolimus or vehicle (1:1). Clinical assessments (erythema [0–3] and scaling [0–3] combined for a total area score [0–6]) were performed at weeks 0, 2, and 4. Inclusion criteria included total area score 4 or greater and erythema 2 or greater. The prespecified primary variable, change from baseline in total area score at week 4, was analyzed using a two-sample t test for intent-to-treat and per protocol populations.

Results

In all, 96 adults of mean age 59.6 years, 88.5% male, were randomized (n = 47 pimecrolimus; 49 vehicle). At week 4, the mean change from baseline in total area score was 3.7 versus 3.3 for pimecrolimus and vehicle groups, respectively (intent-to-treat: P = 0.1913; 95% confidence interval (CI) for difference [-0.195, 0.961]). Per protocol analysis (n = 41 pimecrolimus; 46 vehicle) indicated a significant difference between groups (mean change 3.9 pimecrolimus vs 3.2 vehicle; P = 0.0156; CI [0.129, 1.197]). The superiority of pimecrolimus was observed as early as week 2 (intent-to-treat: P = 0.0062; CI [0.132, 0.777]; per protocol: P = 0.0012; CI [0.410, 1.593]). No drug-related serious adverse events occurred. The most frequent drug-related adverse events were local, mild, and transient (pimecrolimus = 26%; vehicle = 12%).

Limitations

Generalizability is limited by the elderly male study population.

Conclusion

This study suggests that pimecrolimus cream 1% is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for moderate to severe facial seborrheic dermatitis.

### Efficacy of topical 4% quassia amara gel in facial seborrheic dermatitis: a randomized, double-blind, comparative study [^5d0692d4]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Seborrheic dermatitis (SD) is a chronic mild skin disorder with high prevalence. Various treatment options are available, including topical antifungals and anti-inflammatories. Antifungal and anti-inflammatory properties of Quassia amara have been reported.

Aim

To check the efficacy and safety of a topical gel with 4% Quassia amara extract and compare it with topical 2% ketoconazole and 1% topical ciclopiroxolamine in the treatment of facial SD.

Methods

A group of 60 patients displaying facial SD were randomly distributed in 3 groups and given either a topical gel with 4% Quassia amara extract, a topical gel with 2% ketoconazole, or a topical gel with 1% ciclopirox olamine for 4 weeks. Disease severity was assessed at the start and weekly along treatment, as well as 4 weeks after the end of treatment. In each selected area, severity of erythema, scaling, pruritus, and papules were scored from 0 to 3, the sum of these values representing the score of SD on the face. This evaluation was conducted at each visit. The decrease in SD score with all 3 products was compared at each visit. At each stage, overall improvement, safety, and tolerability were also assessed.

Results

Of the 60 patients, 54 (90%) completed the study. The 3 therapeutic options resulted to be very effective, with a significant advantage in efficacy for 4% Quassia extract. For the other 2 drugs, the results were in line with those previously published in the literature.

Conclusion

Topical gel with 4% Quassia extract represents a new, safe, and effective treatment for facial SD.

### Pimecrolimus cream 1% vs. betamethasone 17-valerate 0.1% cream in the treatment of seborrhoeic dermatitis. A randomized open-label clinical trial [^4d0ef208]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Seborrhoeic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory disease with remissions and exacerbations, characterized by erythema, scaling and pruritus primarily on the face, scalp and chest. Corticosteroids and antifungals are the mainstay of therapy. However, chronic use of corticosteroids is associated with side-effects such as skin atrophy and telangiectasia. Pimecrolimus, an inhibitor of calcineurin, has been used successfully in one patient with seborrhoeic dermatitis.

Objectives

The objective of this randomized open-label clinical trial was to compare the efficacy and tolerability of pimecrolimus in comparison with a potent corticosteroid (betamethasone 17-valerate) in the treatment of seborrhoeic dermatitis.

Methods

Twenty patients with seborrhoeic dermatitis were included in this study, 11 patients in the pimecrolimus 1% cream group and nine patients in the betamethasone 17-valerate 0.1% cream group. Patients were instructed to use a thin layer of the study products twice daily at the lesional area and to discontinue treatment as soon as symptoms were absent. Clinical measures assessed were erythema, scaling and pruritus which were evaluated using a four-point scale (0–3).

Results

Both pimecrolimus and betamethasone were highly effective in the treatment of seborrhoeic dermatitis. Betamethasone reduced all three parameters, erythema, scaling and pruritus, faster than pimecrolimus, but the differences in reduction were not statistically significant. Relapses were observed more frequently and were more severe with betamethasone than with pimecrolimus. Moreover, pruritus was not observed after discontinuation of treatment from day 15 and beyond in the pimecrolimus group, whereas it was reported in most patients of the betamethasone group. This difference was statistically significant.

Conclusions

It appears that pimecrolimus, a nonsteroidal topical treatment, may be an excellent alternative therapeutic modality for treating seborrhoeic dermatitis.

### Efficacy of roflumilast foam, 0.3%, in patients with seborrheic dermatitis: a double-blind, vehicle-controlled phase 2a randomized clinical trial [^6002df57]. JAMA Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

Roflumilast foam, 0.3%, was well tolerated and demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile. Rates of treatment-related treatment-emergent AEs, serious AEs, and AEs leading to discontinuation were low and generally comparable with vehicle. Few patients reported stinging, burning, application site reactions, or application site pain with either roflumilast or vehicle treatment. The tolerability profile demonstrates emollient properties of the vehicle formulated without excipients known to cause irritation, such as propylene glycol. This is important because of high rates of application site pain with the only other topical PDE4 inhibitor (crisaborole), which is approved for atopic dermatitis and has rates of application site pain between 13.8% and 31.7%. The low rates of application site pain in the current study suggest this is not a general feature of PDE4 inhibition. Additionally, in a trial evaluating efficacy and tolerability of tacrolimus, 1%, ointment in patients with severe facial seborrheic dermatitis, approximately 47% of patients reported burning. Local tolerability issues and adverse effects associated with other topical treatments of seborrheic dermatitis, such as corticosteroids, antifungals, and off-label use of calcineurin inhibitors, may limit their duration and usage.

The current standard of care for seborrheic dermatitis is to use multiple agents (usually an antifungal and anti-inflammatory). In addition to an anti-inflammatory effect, roflumilast inhibits yeast PDE activity, suggesting a possible additional antifungal effect.

Limitations

A limitation of this study was the 8-week treatment period. A second limitation is the relatively small patient population enrolled in the current trial. A phase 3 randomized clinical trial (n = 457) should provide additional information about efficacy and safety of once-daily roflumilast foam, 0.3%, in patients with seborrheic dermatitis. Third, the number of patients with severe seborrheic dermatitis was small.

### Managing seborrheic keratoses: evolving strategies for optimizing patient outcomes [^56211a3b]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

The seborrheic keratosis is the most common benign skin tumor of middle-aged and elderly adults, affecting nearly 83 million individuals in the US alone. Although these are benign lesions, many patients still undergo some form of treatment. Clinicians are frequently presented with a challenge when determining whether to remove a seborrheic keratosis, and which treatment modality to use when doing so. The most commonly used method of removal is cryotherapy, however there are numerous other options that can be employed with varying degrees of efficacy. In this article, we highlight the use of topical keratolytics, vitamin D analogues, and lasers, to name a few. We also address potential side effects associated with these treatment options, as well as discuss patients' preferences and concerns. We conclude with the most recent advances in topical treatments currently under clinical investigation, and offer treatment strategies aimed at maximizing patient satisfaction. <em> J Drugs Dermatol. 2017;16(11):1064–1068. </em>.

### Letter in response to the case report "Topical ruxolitinib in the treatment of refractory facial seborrheic dermatitis" [^de8ae7e8]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

To the Editor: We read with interest a recent case report by Pope et alof a patient who had complete resolution of his seborrheic dermatitis (SD) and partial resolution of rosacea after 2 weeks of treatment with ruxolitinib cream. We are enthusiastic to share our experience of refractory SD successfully treated with topical ruxolitinib 1.5% cream.

A 27-year-old man presented with pruritus for 7 years and scale of the face, ears, scalp, and chest. Physical examination revealed erythematous scaly papules and plaques on the nose, nasolabial fold, medial cheeks, and chest. He was clinically diagnosed with SD and initially treated with ketoconazole cream 2 times a day for 2 months, followed by zinc pyrithione shampoo 3 times a week for maintenance. He presented again to clinic several years later with continued pruritic rash and was started on betamethasone cream twice a day for 1 week per month, followed by ketoconazole cream daily, without much improvement and subsequent spread of his rash to the bilateral cheeks. He was then started on oral fluconazole 200 mg weekly, azelaic acid 15% gel 2 times a day, and pimecrolimus cream 2 times a day. He experienced some initial improvement but subsequently worsened with re-emergence of his rash and pruritus over the next several months. For a possible component of demodex folliculitis, he was also given oral ivermectin 21 mg weekly for 4 weeks in addition to topical hydrocortisone 2.5% for the face, triamcinolone 0.1% for the chest, and ciclopirox shampoo. Despite these interventions, he continued to have persistent rash and pruritus (Figs 1, A and 2, A). Given his lack of improvement with multiple topical and oral regimens, a punch biopsy was performed on the chest, which showed epidermal hyperplasia with mild spongiosis, perifollicular neutrophilic parakeratosis, and superficial perivascular lymphocytic inflammation, consistent with SD. Given that biopsy prove extremely refractory SD, he was taken off all medications and started on ruxolitinib 1.5% cream, which he used every other day for 4 weeks. He noticed significant improvement of his rash and pruritus in the first week, and by week 4, he had near complete resolution (Figs 1, B and 2, B).

### Tacrolimus 0.1% ointment for seborrhoeic dermatitis: an open-label pilot study [^05c1f341]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Background

As a topical immunosuppressant, tacrolimus ointment may be beneficial in the treatment of seborrhoeic dermatitis, while avoiding adverse effects related to long-term use of topical corticosteroids.

Objectives

To determine the safety and efficacy of topical tacrolimus 0.1% ointment in the treatment of seborrhoeic dermatitis.

Methods

Sixteen subjects (15 men and one woman) were enrolled in a 6-week, open-label, uncontrolled trial of daily topical tacrolimus 0.1% ointment. Following a 2-week washout period for subjects using conventional therapy for seborrhoeic dermatitis, study medication was applied nightly to affected areas until clinical clearance occurred, and then for 7 days thereafter. Lesional extent and severity were assessed at baseline (day 0), at week 2 and at week 6 using the following parameters: (i). clinical assessment of erythema and scaling using a 0–3 scale; (ii). investigator global assessment; (iii). subject global assessment using a 0–6 scale; and (iv). serial photography.

Results

Thirteen of 16 (81%) subjects completed the study protocol; three subjects were lost to follow-up at week 6. Relative to the mean baseline value, the mean lesional erythema scores improved by 66.1% and 70.9% at weeks 2 and 6, respectively. Compared with baseline, the mean scaling scores improved by 63.7% at week 2 and 87.8% at week 6. These observations were statistically significant (P < 0.05, Wilcoxon two-sample test). Mean investigator global assessment scores improved by 76.6% at week 2 and 82.7% at week 6, relative to the mean baseline value. Mean subject global assessment scores also improved, by 69.4% at week 2 and 83.5% at week 6, relative to the mean baseline value. Other than transient application site pruritus/burning in two subjects, no serious adverse events were observed.

Conclusions

This pilot study suggests that topical tacrolimus 0.1% ointment is efficacious in the short-term treatment of seborrhoeic dermatitis. Further controlled trials are warranted, to determine its efficacy and safety for this common condition.

### The efficacy and safety of pimecrolimus 1% cream vs. sertaconazole 2% cream in the treatment of patients with facial seborrhoeic dermatitis: a randomized blinded trial [^b4e6c79d]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Facial seborrhoeic dermatitis(FSD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder characterized by remission and exacerbation episodes. In most cases, FSD requires long-term treatment.

Aim

To compare the efficacy and safety of pimecrolimus and sertaconazole in patients with FSD.

Methods

In total, 60 patients with FSD were enrolled in this double-blind, active-controlled, randomized trial, and instructed to topically apply either pimecrolimus 1% cream (30 patients) orsertaconazole 2% cream (30 patients) twice daily for 4weeks. Assessment of disease severity was performed using the Scoring Index (SI) at baseline, on Days 14 and 28, and at 4weeks after treatment cessation. The levels of satisfaction from treatment and any adverse effects (AEs) were also assessed in both groups.

Results

Although the severity of disease reduced upon treatment in both groups, application of pimecrolimus caused a significantly better improvement than sertaconazole on Days 14 and 28 (P < 0.01 and P < 0.001, respectively). The rate of relapse was significantly lower in the pimecrolimus compared with the sertaconazole group at 4weeks after treatment cessation (P = 0.01). The highest level of satisfaction (46.7%) was observed on Day 28 in the pimecrolimus group. Both topical treatments had acceptable safety profiles; however, pimecrolimus 1% cream was significantly (P < 0.01) less irritating than sertaconazole 2% cream.

Conclusion

Pimecrolimus is associated with faster response and fewer AEs than sertaconazole in patients with FSD.

### Tacrolimus 0.1% versus ciclopiroxolamine 1% for maintenance therapy in patients with severe facial seborrheic dermatitis: a multicenter, double-blind, randomized controlled study [^3872b785]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

No long-term maintenance therapy has been tested in patients with seborrheic dermatitis (SD).

Objective

We sought to compare the efficacy and tolerance of tacrolimus 0.1% ointment versus ciclopiroxolamine 1% cream as maintenance therapy for severe SD.

Methods

This double-blind randomized controlled study was conducted from 2014 to 2017 in 5 Dermatology Departments and 15 dermatology practices in France. Consecutive patients with severe and chronic facial SD were included. Patients were initially treated with desonide 0.05% cream twice daily for 7 days. Patients cleared after this open phase were randomized to receive tacrolimus 0.1% or ciclopiroxolamine 1% cream 2 times a week 24 weeks. The primary endpoint was disease-free-duration, defined as the time from randomization to first relapse.

Results

One hundred fourteen patients were randomized (tacrolimus, n = 57; ciclopiroxolamine, n = 57). Twelve patients relapsed in the tacrolimus group after a median delay of 91.5 days (range 15–195 days) versus 23 patients in the ciclopiroxolamine group (median delay, 27 days [range 13–201 days]). Comparison of disease-free duration curves showed that patients in the tacrolimus group had a longer duration of complete remission than those in the ciclopiroxolamine group (P = 0.018), corresponding to a hazard ratio of relapse of 0.44 (95% confidence interval 0.22–0.89; P = 0.022).

Limitations

The theoretical sample size was not reached.

Conclusion

Tacrolimus 0.1% is more effective than ciclopiroxolamine 1% as maintenance therapy for patients with facial SD.

### Perialar intertrigo in children and adolescents: a multicenter prospective study of 41 cases [^93c3e17a]. Pediatric Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

In our study, the prevalence of psoriasis was higher than the usual prevalence in children (personal history in 17% of children, concomitant psoriasis at inclusion in 14.6%). A potential explanation is that the center with the highest number of cases (Argenteuil) has a high number of children with psoriasis. It is also possible that this entity has several etiologies, including childhood facial psoriasis, seborrheic dermatitis and sebopsoriasis. Seborrheic dermatitis occurs on the scalp and in the face in childrenbut not specifically in the perinasal region. It should be noted that a short letter published in 2002 in the French literature, reported a clinical case similar to that described in our study. The author considered this a clinical form of childhood seborrheic dermatitis and reported the absence of response to antifungals for seborrheic dermatitis, as in our study.

No diagnosis was suggested in 22% of cases. This entity could be an isolated variant of different known facial dermatoses or a specific dermatosis of preadolescence. Changes in microbiota composition during this period of life could induce such an inflammatory skin reaction. A case‐control study of skin microbiota in this location could help answer this question.

The most prescribed treatments by the investigators of this study logically corresponded to the pathogenic hypotheses they raised, namely, metronidazole and topical ivermectin for rosacea, topical retinoids, and benzoyl peroxide for acne and antifungals or topical steroids for seborrheic dermatitis. The design of our study did not include the follow‐up of patients, which prevents evaluation of the effectiveness of the prescribed therapies.

In addition to the ones already mentioned, our study has potential biases and limitations. A center bias is possible since the majority of patients (71%) were recruited from two hospital centres (15 in Argenteuil and 14 in Nice). Wood's lamp examination was not performed in 29% of cases, resulting in a failure to assess the exact frequency of follicular fluorescence. Moreover, the assessment of treatment responses for the intertrigo was only performed in 5 patients and the effectiveness of treatment tried for this dermatosis could not be evaluated. Finally, this entity is probably underestimated in the general pediatric population. Indeed, we can imagine that most children and adolescents do not consult for this intertrigo because of its mild and paucisymptomatic characteristics.

### Diagnosing common benign skin tumors [^07e19b69]. American Family Physician (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for benign skin lesions, more specifically with respect to management of seborrheic keratosis, AAFP 2024 guidelines recommend to recognize that seborrheic keratoses are common benign lesions that may be treated cosmetically. However, consider evaluating for an underlying malignancy if there is a sudden increase in seborrheic keratosis lesions.
