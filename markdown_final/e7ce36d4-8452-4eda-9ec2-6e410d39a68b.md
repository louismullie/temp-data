## Question

Can you take losartan and excedrin together

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether losartan and Excedrin can be taken together safely and what the key risks and precautions are. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the active ingredients in Excedrin and how they interact with losartan. Then, I should verify whether any authoritative drug–drug interaction sources flag a specific interaction. Next, I will examine the main safety concerns: renal effects, blood pressure effects, gastrointestinal bleeding, and hepatic considerations. After that, I should consider patient-specific risk modifiers such as age, kidney function, and comorbidities. Finally, I will synthesize a practical recommendation and monitoring plan, making sure I double-check any assumptions along the way.

> Let me first confirm the components and the pharmacology. Losartan is an angiotensin II receptor blocker that lowers blood pressure and can affect renal hemodynamics and potassium handling, while Excedrin Extra Strength contains acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine. Aspirin is an NSAID, which is the critical piece for potential interaction with losartan, so I need to keep that front-of-mind as I proceed [^114FZeeA] [^111T16mZ].

> Wait, let me verify the direct interaction check before drawing conclusions. DrugBank reports no direct interaction between losartan and the combination of acetaminophen/caffeine, but that dataset does not include aspirin, which is present in Excedrin and is the NSAID of concern here, so I should not over-interpret that negative result as "no interaction" for the full Excedrin product [^117QR8r6].

> I will now examine the principal safety concern: renal effects. The losartan label warns that coadministration of NSAIDs, including COX-2 inhibitors, with ARBs like losartan can lead to deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure, particularly in patients who are elderly, volume-depleted, or have compromised renal function; these effects are usually reversible with discontinuation, but they necessitate caution and monitoring, so I should flag this as the highest-priority risk [^114FZeeA] [^1154KhxR] [^111DRXxh].

> Hold on, I should verify the blood pressure consideration too. NSAIDs can attenuate the antihypertensive effect of ARBs, so concurrent Excedrin (via its aspirin component) may blunt losartan's BP-lowering efficacy; this is especially relevant if BP control is tenuous or if the patient is on higher-intensity regimens, so I need to ensure we account for that potential attenuation in counseling and follow-up [^114FZeeA] [^1154KhxR].

> Next, I should review gastrointestinal bleeding risk. Excedrin contains aspirin, which carries a clear stomach bleeding warning. Risk rises with age, prior GI ulcers or bleeding, concomitant anticoagulants or steroids, and alcohol use, so even though losartan itself is not a bleeding risk, the aspirin in Excedrin can increase GI bleeding probability and warrants caution in higher-risk patients [^111T16mZ] [^1154KhxR].

> Let me consider hepatic risk as well. Acetaminophen can cause severe liver injury if total daily limits are exceeded or if combined with other acetaminophen-containing products. Given losartan is metabolized hepatically, I should confirm the patient's total acetaminophen exposure and alcohol intake to avoid hepatotoxicity, even though this is not a direct losartan–acetaminophen interaction per se [^111T16mZ] [^1154KhxR].

> I need to ensure I address patient-specific modifiers. Elderly patients, those with CKD, heart failure, cirrhosis, or volume depletion have higher susceptibility to NSAID-related renal injury and hypotension when combined with ARBs; in such patients, the renal risk signal is stronger and closer surveillance is warranted if combination use is unavoidable [^114FZeeA] [^111T16mZ].

> But wait, what if the patient truly needs an analgesic and cannot avoid it? I should confirm safer alternatives. For short-term pain relief, acetaminophen alone (without aspirin) is generally preferred with losartan to avoid NSAID-related renal and GI risks; if an NSAID is absolutely necessary, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration, ensure adequate hydration, and consider gastroprotection in those with GI risk, while monitoring renal function and potassium if therapy extends beyond a few days or if the patient is high risk [^114FZeeA] [^114QArEg].

> Let me synthesize the risk–benefit balance. There is no absolute contraindication to taking losartan with Excedrin, but there is a meaningful risk of renal function deterioration and attenuation of BP control due to the aspirin component, with additional GI bleeding and hepatic considerations from the combination formulation. Therefore, occasional, short-term use may be acceptable in otherwise low-risk patients, whereas chronic or repeated use should be avoided in favor of acetaminophen-only products, with explicit counseling on dose limits and warning signs [^114FZeeA] [^111T16mZ] [^1154KhxR].

> I should double-check the practical monitoring advice. If a patient does use Excedrin while on losartan, I would advise watching for reduced urination, swelling, fatigue, dizziness, or abdominal pain, and I would consider checking blood pressure and basic metabolic panel including creatinine and potassium after a few days if use extends beyond the very short term or if the patient has any renal risk factors. Prompt discontinuation and medical evaluation are indicated if symptoms of renal dysfunction or GI bleeding occur [^114FZeeA] [^114QArEg].

> Final recommendation: Yes, losartan and Excedrin can be taken together on an occasional, short-term basis in patients without kidney disease, GI bleeding risk, or hepatic issues, but the combination is not ideal for repeated or chronic use due to NSAID-related renal risks, potential attenuation of losartan's antihypertensive effect, and GI bleeding risk. Prefer acetaminophen-only products for pain control when possible, and if Excedrin is used, keep the course brief, stay within labeled acetaminophen limits, avoid other NSAIDs, and monitor for adverse effects, escalating care if warning symptoms develop [^114FZeeA] [^111T16mZ] [^1154KhxR].

Losartan and Excedrin (acetaminophen/aspirin/caffeine) can be used together **only with caution** and only when necessary. The main concern is the **aspirin in Excedrin**, which can reduce losartan's blood pressure–lowering effect and increase the risk of kidney problems, especially in older adults or those with existing kidney disease [^114FZeeA] [^114QArEg]. If you must use Excedrin, limit the dose and duration, stay hydrated, and monitor for signs of kidney issues or blood pressure changes. For routine pain relief, prefer acetaminophen alone or non-NSAID options, and consult your clinician before combining these medications.

## Pharmacological profiles

### Losartan

- **Class**: Angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB).
- **Mechanism**: Blocks angiotensin II receptors, causing vasodilation and reduced aldosterone, lowering blood pressure.
- **Metabolism**: Hepatic CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 to active metabolite E3174.
- **Key interactions**: NSAIDs can reduce efficacy and increase renal risk [^114FZeeA] [^114QArEg].

---

### Excedrin (acetaminophen, aspirin, caffeine)

- **Acetaminophen**: Analgesic/antipyretic; minimal anti-inflammatory; hepatic metabolism.
- **Aspirin**: NSAID; inhibits COX-1/2, reducing prostaglandins; increases GI bleeding/ulcer risk [^1154KhxR].
- **Caffeine**: Enhances analgesic effect; minimal BP effect at typical doses.

---

## Potential interactions and risks

### Aspirin-losartan interaction

- **Reduced antihypertensive efficacy**: NSAIDs can blunt ARB BP lowering [^114FZeeA] [^114QArEg].
- **Increased renal risk**: NSAIDs + ARBs can cause renal dysfunction, especially in older/volume-depleted patients [^114FZeeA] [^114QArEg].
- **GI bleeding risk**: Aspirin increases GI bleeding, especially with other bleeding risks [^1154KhxR].

---

### Acetaminophen-losartan interaction

There is **no significant interaction**; acetaminophen is generally safe with losartan when used within dosing limits [^117QR8r6].

---

### Caffeine-losartan interaction

There is **no direct interaction**; caffeine's BP effect is small at typical doses and unlikely to offset losartan.

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

Evidence and guidelines indicate that **NSAID caution** applies: NSAIDs (including aspirin) with ARBs can reduce efficacy and increase renal risk; use the lowest effective dose and monitor [^114FZeeA] [^114QArEg]. Routine **combination avoidance** is advised: avoid routine losartan–NSAID use; if needed, limit dose/duration and monitor renal function and BP [^notfound].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing risk

| **Patient factor** | **Risk level** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Age ≥ 65 years | High | Increased renal risk and GI bleeding with NSAIDs [^114FZeeA] [^1154KhxR] |
| Chronic kidney disease | High | Higher risk of NSAID-induced renal dysfunction [^114FZeeA] [^114QArEg] |
| History of GI ulcers/bleeding | High | Increased risk of GI bleeding with aspirin [^1154KhxR] |
| Volume depletion/diuretic use | Moderate | Higher risk of renal dysfunction with NSAIDs [^114FZeeA] [^114QArEg] |
| Liver disease | Moderate | Increased risk of acetaminophen-related hepatotoxicity [^111T16mZ] |

---

## Clinical recommendations

- **Avoid routine combination**: Avoid regular losartan–Excedrin use due to renal and BP risks [^114FZeeA] [^114QArEg].
- **Use lowest effective dose**: If Excedrin is necessary, use the lowest dose for the shortest duration [^111T16mZ].
- **Monitor for adverse effects**: Watch for reduced BP control, edema, reduced urine output, fatigue, or GI symptoms [^114FZeeA] [^114QArEg].
- **Consider alternatives**: Prefer acetaminophen alone or non-NSAID options for pain relief [^117QR8r6].
- **Consult healthcare provider**: Discuss use and monitoring before combining these medications [^114FZeeA] [^114QArEg].

---

## Summary of recommendations

Use Excedrin with losartan **only when necessary**, at the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration, with monitoring for renal and GI effects. Prefer **acetaminophen alone** or non-NSAID options for routine pain relief, and consult your clinician before combining these medications.

RESULTS

Baseline characteristics and laboratory data

A total of 368 patients with hypertension were screened. Among these patients, 231 were randomized to the study, except for 100 patients who failed to attain an office systolic BP of ≥ 140 mm Hg after 4 weeks of losartan monotherapy, 28 patients who withdrew their consent and 9 patients who failed to enrollment because of the protocol violation, pregnancy, and take medication that prohibited. After randomization, 44 patients were excluded because the number of measurements from the 24-hour Mobile-O-Graph examinations was not adequate for the analysis. Finally, 187 patients who completed the 24-hour Mobile-O-Graph examination were analyzed for per-protocol set.

The mean age of participants was 59.2 ± 12.2 years, and a total of 132 (70.6%) male patients were included (Table 1). There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics, classes of previous antihypertensive medications, and current medical history with laboratory data except the uric acid level of participants. On the study completion, serum uric acid level was equalized between 2 groups, and serum fasting glucose (P = 0.0321) and HbA1 C (P = 0.0071) levels were lower in the losartan/amlodipine group compared with those in the losartan/hydrochlorothiazide group. The patients with up-titrated dose and the patients for whom the existing combination dosage was maintained were compared with respect to their number, BP, and other characteristics. The findings have been presented in Supplementary Tables 1–4. Supplementary Table 5 shows the office BP data of these unregistered patients whose systolic BP decreased to < 140 mm Hg after losartan monotherapy.

Table 1.
Baseline characteristics

The Na + level was significantly lower in the losartan/hydrochlorothiazide group (P = 0.0037) after the 20-week treatment. There was no significant difference in the serum K + level between the 2 groups (Tables 1 and 2).

### Mechanisms underlying the blood pressure-lowering effects of empagliflozin, losartan and their combination in people with type 2 diabetes: a secondary analysis of a randomized crossover trial [^113EC4zN]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

The first goal of this secondary prespecified analysis of a randomized, double‐blind, crossover trial was to determine whether combined RAS inhibition and SGLT2 inhibition had larger effects on blood pressure than either of the drugs alone, as compared with placebo. Second, we investigated the involved mechanisms underlying these blood pressure‐lowering effects. Compared with placebo, we observed a greater reduction in blood pressure in the empagliflozin + losartan combination arm than the effects of the empagliflozin and losartan monotherapy arms versus placebo. In addition, combination therapy had a significant larger effect on SBP than empagliflozin monotherapy and a numerically larger effect versus monotherapy. This may indicate that combination therapy may induce synergistic effects on blood pressure lowering, which is in line with a recently published meta‐analysis, although we were underpowered to formally test this.

ARBs have antihypertensive properties, achieved by blocking the vasoconstrictive actions of angiotensin II. In addition, ARBs reduce systemic vascular resistanceand improve endothelial function, potentially being factors contributing to the blood pressure‐lowering effect observed in the losartan monotherapy arm. Furthermore, ARBs reduce the collagen content of the arteries and attenuate extracellular matrix remodelling, thereby improving arterial distensibility. A reduction in pulse pressure leads to improvement of arterial distensibility and thereby reduction of arterial stiffness. We observed a significant reduction in pulse pressure in the losartan arm compared with placebo. This may indicate that a reduction in arterial stiffness may play a role in the blood pressure‐lowering effect of losartan.

Angiotensin II exerts different actions on the SNS, including a central action to increase sympathetic stimulation, stimulatory effects on sympathetic ganglia and adrenal medulla, and actions at sympathetic nerve endings that serve to facilitate sympathetic neurotransmission. There is considerable evidence that the actions of endogenous angiotensin II on the SNS enhance the cardiovascular responses elicited by the activation of the SNS. By inhibiting angiotensin II using ARBs, these actions on SNS activity are consequently diminished. We indeed observed a reduction in SNS activity, mainly by a reduction in RPP, which may indicate a dampening effect of ARBs on SNS activity. In this trial, we did not find any changes in volume variables in the losartan monotherapy arm compared with placebo, suggesting that a reduction in arterial stiffness and SNS activity contributes to a larger extent than volume contraction to the blood pressure‐lowering effect of RAS inhibition.

### Losartan (losartan potassium) [^115fYL3a]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Losartan potassium tablets have not been studied in children less than 6 years old or in children with certain kidney problems.

High Blood Pressure (hypertension). Blood pressure is the force in your blood vessels when your heart beats and when your heart rests. You have high blood pressure when the force is too much. Losartan potassium tablets can help your blood vessels relax so your blood pressure is lower.

Left Ventricular Hypertrophy (LVH) is an enlargement of the walls of the left chamber of the heart (the heart's main pumping chamber). LVH can happen from several things. High blood pressure is the most common cause of LVH.

Type 2 Diabetes with Nephropathy. Type 2 diabetes is a type of diabetes that happens mainly in adults. If you have diabetic nephropathy it means that your kidneys do not work properly because of damage from the diabetes.

Who should not take losartan potassium tablets?

Do not take losartan potassium tablets if you are allergic to any of the ingredients in losartan potassium tablets. See the end of this leaflet for a complete list of ingredients in losartan potassium tablets.
Do not take losartan potassium tablets if you have diabetes and are taking a medicine called aliskiren to reduce blood pressure.

What should I tell my doctor before taking losartan potassium tablets?

Tell your doctor about all of your medical conditions including if you:

are pregnant or planning to become pregnant. See "What is the most important information I should know about losartan potassium tablets?"
are breastfeeding. It is not known if losartan potassium passes into your breast milk. You should choose either to take losartan potassium tablets or breastfeed, but not both.

### Effect of losartan on performance and physiological responses to exercise at high altitude (5035 M) [^114vfLXt]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2021). High credibility.

What are the findings?

Losartan, an angiotensin II type-I receptor antagonist, had no observable effect on either resting or exercise blood pressure responses at 5035 m, nor did it reliably reduce exercise-induced symptomology of pulmonary hypertension or improve arterial saturation.
Losartan did not improve exercise performance at 5035 m.

How might it impact on clinical practice in the future?

Findings of a null effect on blood pressure management has implications for hypertensive individuals currently receiving antihypertensive treatment who travel to high altitudes, as they may be at greater risk for high altitude illness and cardiovascular events than the normotensive individuals tested herein.

Patient and public involvement

This study was supported by the Birmingham Medical Research Expeditionary Society, which provided input for the conduct of the research. Patients were not included. Public involvement was limited to recruitment. Notification was given to participants at the time of consent that acquisition of personal data was permitted on request. Permission was also obtained at this time for the dissemination of deidentified data within the research team and only externally when a reasonable request was submitted directly to the corresponding author of the present study within 6 months of its publication. A portion of the cohort was invited to review the research methods for accuracy and readability.

Participants give their written informed consent and the study was conducted in agreement with Declaration of Helsinki principles. This study did not aim to investigate safety or efficacy of the already Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug included, thus no clinical trial approval was obtained. There were no active FDA recalls for the drug for the duration of the study.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Renin–angiotensin system blocker combinations and same-class antihypertensive use — high-quality randomized controlled trial reports demonstrate that simultaneous administration of renin–angiotensin system (RAS) blockers (an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor [ACEi] combined with an angiotensin receptor blocker [ARB] or an ACEi or ARB combined with aliskiren) increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, and hyperkalemia; drug combinations with similar mechanisms should be avoided, two drugs from the same class should not be administered together (for example, two different beta blockers, ACEi, or dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers [CCB]), and two drugs that target the same blood pressure control system (for example, ACEi and ARB) are less effective and potentially harmful when used together, with exceptions including concomitant use of thiazide-type and potassium-sparing diuretics and thiazide-type and loop diuretics, and dihydropyridine and nondihydropyridine CCB can be combined for additional blood pressure lowering in selected patients.

### A randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover study of losartan and enalapril in patients with essential hypertension [^111yvkBd]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

The primary objective of this randomised, placebo- controlled, double-blind, crossover study, was to evaluate and compare the longer term effects of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist losartan and the converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril on 24-h ambulatory blood pressure (BP). After a 4-week placebo run-in period, nine patients with essential hypertension entered the double-blind phase of the study, which consisted of three 6-week periods during which patients were treated with placebo, enalapril 20 mg o.d. or losartan 50 mg o.d. Losartan and enalapril, taken between 07.00 and 08.00, reduced ambulatory BP throughout the 24-h period. Average night time BP was reduced from 133/85 mm Hg on placebo to 124/78 mm Hg on enalapril and to 126/77 mm Hg on losartan. Daytime BP averaged 157/101 mm Hg on placebo, and was significantly lower during enalapril (142/91 mm Hg) than during losartan treatment (147/95 mm Hg). Clinic BP, measured 2 to 4 hours after drug intake, was reduced to the same extent by both drugs. The losartan-induced BP changes were significantly related to those obtained with enalapril (0.63 < r < 0.93). Ambulatory BP monitoring was repeated after 4 weeks of combined therapy in six patients. The BP lowering effect of the combination was not significantly better than that achieved with enalapril alone. In conclusion, losartan 50 mg o.d. and enalapril 20 mg o.d. lower BP to approximately the same extent, except for a more pronounced effect of enalapril on daytime ambulatory BP. The current study does not provide convincing evidence that addition of losartan to enalapril in the doses used further reduces BP.

### Combination therapy is superior to sequential monotherapy for the initial treatment of hypertension: a double-blind randomized controlled trial [^113gqDFC]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

We found a large average difference in HSBP in favor of initial use of combination therapy compared with initial monotherapy across the first 8 months of the study (phases 1 and 2); there was no discernible subset of patients in whom this difference was not observed. It was largely due to the superiority of combination therapy in the first 16 weeks (phase 1), by margins of almost 8 and 10 mm Hg, respectively, for home and clinic systolic BP. Although combination therapy is expected to show superior efficacy and is recommended for stage 2 hypertension by some guidelines, this has not yet become the norm in routine practice. Consequently, we incorporated a number of planned measurements in the study design that we believed, if positive, would help to change practice.

The first of the additional measurements was the co–primary end point of HSBP at 32 weeks, the prespecified time point for evaluation of the never‐catch‐up hypothesis that initial less intense BP control results in subsequently poorer BP control. This hypothesis was rejected. Never catching up in the ASCOT and VALUE trials, from which the hypothesis arose, may be more a consequence of suboptimal treatments being combined rather than optimal treatments being started sequentially. 7, 10 In contrast, our other original comparisons provide strong support for the rationale of initial combination. A unique feature of PATHWAY‐1 is the "trial within a trial" of a randomized monotherapy crossover trial, the aims of which were to ensure that each participant's best therapy at maximal force‐titrated dose was compared with combination therapy. Several clear‐cut, connected findings emerged. First, we established that among the baseline predictors of BP response to each drug, plasma renin provided a measure with substantial and significant differences in response to losartan and HCTZ between the outer tertiles (BP lowering by HCTZ was greatest in the low‐renin tertile and by losartan in the high‐renin tertile). Second, and in marked contrast to the monotherapy responses, with combination therapy, BP reduction did not vary among tertiles of renin or with other predictors. The important practical inference is that initial combination is not only effective but uniformly effective, reducing the heterogeneity in response — as illustrated by the 97% responder and 75% control rates (Table S3), with odds ratios of 8 and 5 compared with monotherapy. Third, as graphically illustrated in Figure 3 C, initial combination therapy is not only uniformly effective and superior to monotherapy but is uniformly superior to personalized monotherapy, whether achieved by prediction of each patient's best drug or by systematic crossover between the options. Even if, within the environment of a trial — with its forced dose‐drug titrations and fixed visit appointments — BP in the monotherapy arm caught up with initial combination by 32 weeks, it is reasonable to suggest the marked advantage for everyday practice of a regimen that achieves target BP in the shortest possible time and the least number of visits.

### Mechanisms underlying the blood pressure-lowering effects of empagliflozin, losartan and their combination in people with type 2 diabetes: a secondary analysis of a randomized crossover trial [^117QatSP]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Aim

To study the effects of the sodium‐glucose co‐transporter‐2 (SGLT2) inhibitor empagliflozin, the angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) losartan, and their combination on blood pressure, while studying the mechanisms potentially involved.

Methods

A total of 24 people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) (age: 66 ± 6 years; body mass index: 31.0 ± 3 kg/m 2; estimated glomerular filtration rate: 90 ml/min/1.73 m²) received a 1‐week treatment with empagliflozin 10 mg once daily, losartan 50 mg once daily, their combination, and placebo, in a randomized double‐blind crossover design, with 4‐week washout periods in between. Blood pressure, arterial stiffness, autonomic nervous system activity and plasma volume, extracellular fluid and serum albumin were assessed.

Results

Versus placebo (139 mmHg), empagliflozin reduced systolic blood pressure (SBP) by 8 mmHg (P = 0.001), losartan by 12 mmHg (P = 0.001) and empagliflozin + losartan by 15 mmHg (P < .001). Combination therapy had a larger SBP‐lowering effect versus empagliflozin monotherapy (‐7 [95% CI ‐12; ‐2] mmHg) and numerically larger effects versus losartan monotherapy (‐3 [‐8; 2] mmHg). Empagliflozin reduced sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity, arterial stiffness and extracellular fluid, while increasing serum albumin. Losartan reduced SNS activity and arterial stiffness. Combination therapy induced volume contraction variables, together with a reduction in SNS activity and arterial stiffness.

Conclusion

In people with T2D, SGLT2 inhibition in combination with an ARB had a larger blood pressure‐lowering effect versus placebo than either of the drugs alone. Our data further suggest that the mechanisms underlying these blood pressure reductions at least partially differ between these agents.

### Effects of losartan vs candesartan in reducing cardiovascular events in the primary treatment of hypertension [^116BP6qL]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2010). Low credibility.

The losartan group were older (+0.7 years), had lower systolic and diastolic blood pressures (−1/−1 mm Hg), had higher blood glucose (+0.1 mmol l −1), had higher HbA1c (+0.1%), and had a higher prevalence of diabetes (+2.8%), were less frequently treated with thiazides (−2.3%) and β-blockers (−2.0%) and more frequently treated with glucose lowering drugs (+1.7%), statins (+1.3%), and antithrombotics (+0.8%) compared with the candesartan group (Table 1).

Some blood pressure recordings were absent at all time points. Figure 2 shows the similar blood pressure levels that were recorded during the follow-up, and also the number of missing values. The frequency of blood pressure recordings was equal in both groups. When calculating 95% CIs for the blood pressures values at each time point, no significant differences between the losartan and candesartan group were observed (data on file).

### Combination ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers for hypertension [^1131Apbs]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To review data concerning combined angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) therapy for hypertension.

Data Sources

MEDLINE (1966-April 2003), IPA (1970-April 2003), and EMBASE (1974-April 2003) with search terms of ACE inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker, essential hypertension, and combination therapy.

Data Synthesis

ACE inhibitors provide incomplete blockade of the renin-angiotensin system, sometimes leading to loss of blood pressure control. Addition of ARBs may in theory further reduce blood pressure. Studies of combined ACE inhibitor and ARB therapy for managing hypertension were evaluated.

Conclusions

While studies have shown statistically significant blood pressure reductions with ACE/ARB combination therapy, clinical significance is lacking. Further trials are needed before routine use of the combination can be recommended.

### New developments in antihypertensive drugs [^113tKWjt]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

New developments in antihypertensive drug treatment include optimizing the use of established drugs, the introduction of novel compounds, and a renewed appreciation that hypertension is but one of various cardiovascular risk factors that must be addressed in managing the patient with raised blood pressure. Thus, the approach used must be tailored to the individual patient both in terms of drug choice and dose as well as preventive measures. New drug development depends very much on improving our understanding of the pathophysiologic mechanisms involved in hypertension and seems likely to be applied at the level of the renin angiotensin system and other local factors governing vascular smooth muscle function.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Choice of initial monotherapy versus initial combination therapy — adults with stage 2 hypertension (systolic blood pressure [SBP] ≥ 140 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure [DBP] ≥ 90 mm Hg) are recommended to start two first-line agents of different classes, ideally as a single-pill combination (SPC), to improve blood pressure control and adherence. In adults with stage 1 hypertension (SBP 130–139 mm Hg and DBP 80–89 mm Hg), initiating therapy with a single first-line drug is reasonable with dose titration and sequential addition of other agents as needed to achieve control. In adults with hypertension, simultaneous use of an ACEi, ARB, and/or renin inhibitor in combination is not recommended due to the potential for harm.

### First-line drugs for hypertension [^115FQHjS]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

This is the first update of a review published in 2009. Sustained moderate to severe elevations in resting blood pressure leads to a critically important clinical question: What class of drug to use first-line? This review attempted to answer that question.

Objectives

To quantify the mortality and morbidity effects from different first-line antihypertensive drug classes: thiazides (low-dose and high-dose), beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB), and alpha-blockers, compared to placebo or no treatment. Secondary objectives: when different antihypertensive drug classes are used as the first-line drug, to quantify the blood pressure lowering effect and the rate of withdrawal due to adverse drug effects, compared to placebo or no treatment.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials up to November 2017: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work.

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials (RCT) of at least one year duration, comparing one of six major drug classes with a placebo or no treatment, in adult patients with blood pressure over 140/90 mmHg at baseline. The majority (over 70%) of the patients in the treatment group were taking the drug class of interest after one year. We included trials with both hypertensive and normotensive patients in this review if the majority (over 70%) of patients had elevated blood pressure, or the trial separately reported outcome data on patients with elevated blood pressure.

Data Collection and Analysis

The outcomes assessed were mortality, stroke, coronary heart disease (CHD), total cardiovascular events (CVS), decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and withdrawals due to adverse drug effects. We used a fixed-effect model to to combine dichotomous outcomes across trials and calculate risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). We presented blood pressure data as mean difference (MD) with 99% CI.

Main Results

The 2017 updated search failed to identify any new trials. The original review identified 24 trials with 28 active treatment arms, including 58,040 patients. We found no RCTs for ARBs or alpha-blockers. These results are mostly applicable to adult patients with moderate to severe primary hypertension. The mean age of participants was 56 years, and mean duration of follow-up was three to five years. High-quality evidence showed that first-line low-dose thiazides reduced mortality (11.0% with control versus 9.8% with treatment; RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.97); total CVS (12.9% with control versus 9.0% with treatment; RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.76), stroke (6.2% with control versus 4.2% with treatment; RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.77), and coronary heart disease (3.9% with control versus 2.8% with treatment; RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.84). Low- to moderate-quality evidence showed that first-line high-dose thiazides reduced stroke (1.9% with control versus 0.9% with treatment; RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.61) and total CVS (5.1% with control versus 3.7% with treatment; RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.82), but did not reduce mortality (3.1% with control versus 2.8% with treatment; RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.05), or coronary heart disease (2.7% with control versus 2.7% with treatment; RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.20). Low- to moderate-quality evidence showed that first-line beta-blockers did not reduce mortality (6.2% with control versus 6.0% with treatment; RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.07) or coronary heart disease (4.4% with control versus 3.9% with treatment; RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.03), but reduced stroke (3.4% with control versus 2.8% with treatment; RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.97) and total CVS (7.6% with control versus 6.8% with treatment; RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.98). Low- to moderate-quality evidence showed that first-line ACE inhibitors reduced mortality (13.6% with control versus 11.3% with treatment; RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.95), stroke (6.0% with control versus 3.9% with treatment; RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.82), coronary heart disease (13.5% with control versus 11.0% with treatment; RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.94), and total CVS (20.1% with control versus 15.3% with treatment; RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.85). Low-quality evidence showed that first-line calcium channel blockers reduced stroke (3.4% with control versus 1.9% with treatment; RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.84) and total CVS (8.0% with control versus 5.7% with treatment; RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.87), but not coronary heart disease (3.1% with control versus 2.4% with treatment; RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.09), or mortality (6.0% with control versus 5.1% with treatment; RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.09). There was low-quality evidence that withdrawals due to adverse effects were increased with first-line low-dose thiazides (5.0% with control versus 11.3% with treatment; RR 2.38, 95% CI 2.06 to 2.75), high-dose thiazides (2.2% with control versus 9.8% with treatment; RR 4.48, 95% CI 3.83 to 5.24), and beta-blockers (3.1% with control versus 14.4% with treatment; RR 4.59, 95% CI 4.11 to 5.13). No data for these outcomes were available for first-line ACE inhibitors or calcium channel blockers. The blood pressure data were not used to assess the effect of the different classes of drugs as the data were heterogeneous, and the number of drugs used in the trials differed.

Authors' Conclusions

First-line low-dose thiazides reduced all morbidity and mortality outcomes in adult patients with moderate to severe primary hypertension. First-line ACE inhibitors and calcium channel blockers may be similarly effective, but the evidence was of lower quality. First-line high-dose thiazides and first-line beta-blockers were inferior to first-line low-dose thiazides.

### Losartan potassium (Arbli) [^116k4nuZ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

7.1 Agents Increasing Serum Potassium

Co-administration of losartan with other drugs that raise serum potassium levels may result in hyperkalemia. Monitor serum potassium in such patients.

7.2 Lithium

Increases in serum lithium concentrations and lithium toxicity have been reported during concomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin II receptor antagonists. Monitor serum lithium levels during concomitant use.

7.3 Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs
(NSAIDs) Including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors)

In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists (including losartan) may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving losartan and NSAID therapy.

The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including losartan, may be attenuated by NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors.

7.4 Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS)

Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, syncope, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy.

The Veterans Affairs Nephropathy in Diabetes (VA NEPHRON-D) trial enrolled 1,448 patients with type 2 diabetes, elevated urinary-albumin-to-creatinine ratio, and decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR 30 to 89.9 mL/min), randomized them to lisinopril or placebo on a background of losartan therapy and followed them for a median of 2.2 years. Patients receiving the combination of losartan and lisinopril did not obtain any additional benefit compared to monotherapy for the combined endpoint of decline in GFR, end stage renal disease, or death, but experienced an increased incidence of hyperkalemia and acute kidney injury compared with the monotherapy group.

In most patients no benefit has been associated with using two RAS inhibitors concomitantly. In general, avoid combined use of RAS inhibitors. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function, and electrolytes in patients on losartan and other agents that affect the RAS.

Do not co-administer aliskiren with losartan in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with losartan in patients with renal impairment (GFR < 60 mL/min).

### Starting antihypertensive drug treatment with combination therapy: controversies in hypertension-con side of the argument [^1142ib5F]. Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

In the double-blind PATHWAY-1 study (Prevention and Treatment of Hypertension With Algorithm-Based Therapy Trial), of 796 screened patients, 605 (76.0%) were randomized and 432 (71.4%) completed the 1-year follow-up period. Eligible patients were untreated, aged 18 to 79 years, and had a self-measured home systolic/diastolic BP of ≥ 150/ ≥ 95 mm Hg. They were randomized to initial monotherapy with losartan 50 to 100 mg/d (N = 151) or hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 to 25 mg/d (N = 150), crossing over at 8 weeks (switching to the alternative monotherapy), or initial combination treatment with losartan 50 to 100 mg/d plus hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 to 25 mg/d (N = 304). In phase 2 (weeks 17–32), all patients received losartan 100 mg and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 to 25 mg. In phase 3 (weeks 33–52), amlodipine with or without doxazosin could be added to achieve target BP. The primary end point was the change in the systolic home BP (target systolic/diastolic home BP > 140/ > 90 mm Hg). The original protocol prespecified the time of the primary end point at the end of phase 2, namely, 32 weeks after randomization, at which time all patients were receiving the same therapy. The statistical analysis plan, published before the data lock and unblinding, introduced 2 hierarchical co-primary end points. The first was the reduction in the systolic home BP averaged over phases 1 and 2, testing for the superiority of initial combination therapy over monotherapy. The co-primary end point, to be tested only if the first hypothesis was confirmed, was the reduction in systolic home BP at week 32, a time point, when all participants were receiving the same treatment. Comparing initial monotherapy with initial combination therapy (Figure 1), the systolic/diastolic reductions in the home BP were 13.3/6.5 versus 21.9/12.1 mm Hg (end of phase 1), 20.1/10.7 versus 19.5/10.6 mm Hg at week 24 (midpoint of phase 2), 23.6/12.7 versus 22.0/11.9 mm Hg at week 32 (end of phase 2), and 24.5/13.9 versus 23.6/13.4 mm Hg at week 52 (end of study). By the end of phase 3, over 75% of participants in the initial monotherapy and combination therapy groups had attained the target home BP with no difference between groups at the end of either phase 2 or 3. Based on the redefinition of the primary end points, the PATHWAY-1 researchers reported the average BP results combining phases 2 and 3 and all study periods. They concluded that initial combination therapy achieved target BP in twice as many participants as initial monotherapy, whereas in fact starting from week 24 (Figure 1), home BP was similar irrespective of whether antihypertensive treatment was started with SPC or free SD combination therapy. In the context of the current debate, a relevant finding of the PATHWAY-1 trial was that the BP reductions induced by losartan and hydrochlorothiazide were greatest in the top and bottom plasma renin activity tertiles, respectively, an argument supporting an insightful rather than a simplistic initiation of antihypertensive drug therapy.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Hypotension: Correct volume or salt depletion prior to administration of Losartan potassium. (5.2)
Monitor renal function and potassium in susceptible patients. (5.3, 5.4)

5.1 Fetal Toxicity

Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue Losartan potassium as soon as possible [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

5.2 Hypotension in Volume- or Salt-Depleted Patients

In patients with an activated renin-angiotensin system, such as volume- or salt-depleted patients (e.g., those being treated with high doses of diuretics), symptomatic hypotension may occur after initiation of treatment with Losartan potassium. Correct volume or salt depletion prior to administration of Losartan potassium [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

5.3 Renal Function Deterioration

Changes in renal function including acute renal failure can be caused by drugs that inhibit the renin-­angiotensin system and by diuretics. Patients whose renal function may depend in part on the activity of the renin-angiotensin system (e.g., patients with renal artery stenosis, chronic kidney disease, severe congestive heart failure, or volume depletion) may be at particular risk of developing acute renal failure on Losartan potassium. Monitor renal function periodically in these patients. Consider withholding or discontinuing therapy in patients who develop a clinically significant decrease in renal function on Losartan potassium [see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].

5.4 Hyperkalemia

Monitor serum potassium periodically and treat appropriately. Dosage reduction or discontinuation of Losartan potassium may be required [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Concomitant use of other drugs that may increase serum potassium may lead to hyperkalemia [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

HSBP Results (Intention‐to‐Treat and Per‐Protocol Analyses) for Primary End Point (Average of Weeks 4–32) and Hierarchical Co–Primary End Point at Week 32

By the end of phase 3, ≥ 75% of participants in both groups were at target (Table S4), with no difference between groups at the end of either phase 2 or 3. In contrast, only 40% of responses to initial monotherapy were controlled at target at the end of phase 1 (Figure 3 B), increasing to 50% of all responses to monotherapy (ie, on either losartan or HCTZ; Tables S5 and S6). Post hoc analysis identified only 35 participants whose initial monotherapy was their best treatment (Table S7).

In the monotherapy arm crossover, losartan and HCTZ were the more effective drugs in younger and older participants, respectively, but the age effect was modest, and losartan 100 mg was more effective than HCTZ 25 mg in most participants aged > 55 years (Table 3). Participants in the top renin tertile responded by 3.7 mm Hg more to losartan and by 4.3 mm Hg less to HCTZ than those in the lowest tertile, an overall difference between treatments of 8 mm Hg (Table 3, P < 0.001). In contrast, the response to combination therapy was independent of renin tertile and, on average, 5 mm Hg greater than the response to the best drug for each tertile (Figure 3 C). There was a greater response to all drugs, especially losartan, in women. Previous treatment favored response to combination, whereas monotherapy was more effective in participants who were naïve to treatment.

LV mass was measured in 85 patients (41 on combination therapy and 44 on monotherapy [22 in each monotherapy arm]). LV mass normalized for body surface area was significantly reduced between baseline and the end of the study (−10.4%, P < 0.001) but was not different between the combination and sequential monotherapy arms of the study.

### Randomized placebo-controlled trial of losartan for pediatric NAFLD [^112KUAuN]. Hepatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Dosing, randomization, and treatment groups

Losartan, an ARB, is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of hypertension in children, and dosing has been established in pediatric populations within a range of 0.7–1.4 mg/kg/day, up to maximum dose of 100 mg. In this study, the weight range for eligibility was ≥ 70 kg to < 150 kg at screening to maintain the daily dose of 100 mg within the currently established pediatric dosing range of 0.7–1.4 mg/kg/day. The starting dose was one 50‐mg capsule of losartan or matching placebo per day for 1 week, then two capsules of 50 mg of losartan or matching placebo once per day (100 mg total) from weeks 2–24. This titration approach is recommended to minimize any side effects after starting medication. The FDA reviewed the study protocol and recommended this approach and dosing before study initiation.

All children who had had a clinical liver biopsy within the past 2 years were screened for eligibility. Participants meeting eligibility criteria were enrolled by clinic personnel and assigned (1:1) to losartan or placebo using a computer‐generated random allocation sequence with permuted blocks, by a centrally administered procedure stratified by clinic. Clinical site investigators, clinical coordinators, staff, and participants were blinded to treatment assignment.

### Combination therapy is superior to sequential monotherapy for the initial treatment of hypertension: a double-blind randomized controlled trial [^111N7KCo]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Guidelines for hypertension vary in their preference for initial combination therapy or initial monotherapy, stratified by patient profile; therefore, we compared the efficacy and tolerability of these approaches.

Methods and Results

We performed a 1‐year, double‐blind, randomized controlled trial in 605 untreated patients aged 18 to 79 years with systolic blood pressure ≥ 150 mm Hg or diastolic ≥ 95 mm Hg. In phase 1 (weeks 0–16), patients were randomly assigned to initial monotherapy (losartan 50–100 mg or hydrochlorothiazide 12.5–25 mg crossing over at 8 weeks), or initial combination (losartan 50–100 mg plus hydrochlorothiazide 12.5–25 mg). In phase 2 (weeks 17–32), all patients received losartan 100 mg and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 to 25 mg. In phase 3 (weeks 33–52), amlodipine with or without doxazosin could be added to achieve target. Hierarchical primary outcomes were the difference from baseline in home systolic, averaged over phases 1 and 2 and, if significant, at 32 weeks. Secondary outcomes included adverse events, and difference in home systolic BP responses between tertiles of plasma renin. Home systolic BP after initial monotherapy fell 4.9 mm Hg (range: 3.7–6.0 mm Hg) less over 32 weeks (P < 0.001) than after initial combination but caught up at 32 weeks (difference 1.2 mm Hg [range: −0.4 to 2.8 mm Hg], P = 0.13). In phase 1, home systolic BP response to each monotherapy differed substantially between renin tertiles, whereas response to combination therapy was uniform and at least 5 mm Hg more than to monotherapy.

### Effects of losartan vs candesartan in reducing cardiovascular events in the primary treatment of hypertension [^111MTLUo]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2010). Low credibility.

Conclusion

We believe that our study method provides a new tool that can be used to study existing treatments, providing rapid results at a low cost. However, it requires the wide use of similar electronic patient journal systems in primary care and a long tradition with nationwide hospitalization and cause of death registers. Sweden offers this combination and provides the opportunity to study differences between treatments, not feasible to assess in randomized clinical trials.

The results of this study suggest that there is a blood pressure independent risk reduction in CVD with candesartan compared to losartan in the primary treatment of hypertension. This suggests that pharmacological differences within the ARB class may translate into important clinical effects. Furthermore, the study of a real life situation may provide an additional method that can be used to assess existing and future treatments.

### Losartan potassium [^111DRXxh]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

7.1 Agents Increasing Serum Potassium

Coadministration of losartan with other drugs that raise serum potassium levels may result in hyperkalemia. Monitor serum potassium in such patients.

7.2 Lithium

Increases in serum lithium concentrations and lithium toxicity have been reported during concomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin II receptor antagonists. Monitor serum lithium levels during concomitant use.

7.3 Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) Including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors)

In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, coadministration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists (including losartan) may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving losartan and NSAID therapy.

The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including losartan, may be attenuated by NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors.

7.4 Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS)

Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, syncope, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy.

The Veterans Affairs Nephropathy in Diabetes (VA NEPHRON-D) trial enrolled 1448 patients with type 2 diabetes, elevated urinary-albumin-to-creatinine ratio, and decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR 30 to 89.9 mL/min), randomized them to lisinopril or placebo on a background of losartan therapy and followed them for a median of 2.2 years. Patients receiving the combination of losartan and lisinopril did not obtain any additional benefit compared to monotherapy for the combined endpoint of decline in GFR, end stage renal disease, or death, but experienced an increased incidence of hyperkalemia and acute kidney injury compared with the monotherapy group.

In most patients no benefit has been associated with using two RAS inhibitors concomitantly. In general, avoid combined use of RAS inhibitors. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function, and electrolytes in patients on losartan potassium and other agents that affect the RAS.

Do not coadminister aliskiren with losartan potassium in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with losartan potassium in patients with renal impairment (GFR < 60 mL/min).

### 2020 American College of Rheumatology guideline for the management of gout [^1123zGEX]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

American College of Rheumatology gout guideline — management of concurrent medications states: Switching hydrochlorothiazide to an alternate antihypertensive when feasible is conditionally recommended for patients with gout, regardless of disease activity. Choosing losartan preferentially as an antihypertensive agent when feasible is conditionally recommended for patients with gout, regardless of disease activity. Stopping low-dose aspirin (for patients who are taking this medication for appropriate indications) is conditionally recommended against for patients with gout, regardless of disease activity. Adding or switching cholesterol-lowering agents to fenofibrate is conditionally recommended against for patients with gout, regardless of disease activity. Switching, stopping, or adding a medication should only be considered when the potential SU concentration/gout benefits exceed the potential risks or harms of the medication change. Recognizing that there are few practical alternatives to low-dose aspirin, the Voting Panel specifically recommended against its cessation as a means of SU reduction when a patient is taking it for an appropriate indication.

Table A — Target doses of guideline-directed medical therapies in heart failure lists angiotensin–converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors with target dosing and 50% thresholds: captopril 50 mg, three times daily (total daily target dose 150 mg; 50% 75 mg); enalapril 10 mg, twice daily (20 mg; 10 mg); lisinopril 20 mg, once daily (20 mg; 10 mg); ramipril 10 mg, once daily (10 mg; 5 mg); and perindopril 8 mg, once daily (8 mg; 4 mg). For angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB), examples include candesartan 32 mg, once daily (32 mg; 16 mg); losartan 100 mg, once daily (100 mg; 50 mg) with the note that "ACCF/AHA Guidelines recommend losartan 150 mg as target dose. However, because current FDA-approved labeling has 100 mg as the maximal dose, the 100-mg dose is used in the performance measure".; and valsartan 160 mg, twice daily (320 mg; 160 mg). For angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI), sacubitril/valsartan 97/103 mg, twice daily (194/206 mg; 98/102 mg†) is listed, with the footnote that "The sacubitril 98 mg and valsartan 102 mg total daily dosing (49/51 mg twice daily) is considered fulfilling the 50% of target dosing criteria". Evidence-based beta-blockers include bisoprolol 10 mg, once daily (10 mg; 5 mg), carvedilol 25 mg, twice daily (50 mg; 25 mg), carvedilol extended release 80 mg, once daily (80 mg; 40 mg), and metoprolol succinate sustained release 200 mg, once daily (200 mg; 100 mg).

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^111MARku]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

Blockers of the renin–angiotensin system (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors [ACE inhibitors] and angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]) are widely used and have similar effectiveness as each other and other major drug classes on major cardiovascular events and mortality outcomes; ARBs are associated with significantly lower treatment discontinuation rates for adverse events than those of all other antihypertensive therapies, and similar rates to placebo. ACE inhibitors and ARBs should not be combined for the treatment of hypertension because there is no added benefit on outcomes and an excess of renal adverse events; dual combination of renin–angiotensin system blockers also led to premature cessation of a trial when aliskiren was combined with either an ACE inhibitor or an ARB in people with diabetes, and this result halted further research into the clinical utility of aliskiren for BP treatment. Both ACE inhibitors and ARBs reduce albuminuria more than other BP-lowering drugs and are effective at delaying the progression of diabetic and non-diabetic CKD.

Renin–angiotensin system (RAS) dual blockade with aliskiren in diabetes — trial outcomes and regulatory actions: "One 6-month phase 2 study" (AVOID) "reported a further reduction of albuminuria" when aliskiren was added to losartan in type 2 diabetes with macroalbuminuria. The phase 3 ALTITUDE trial enrolled three groups: "albuminuria ≥ 200 mg/g"; "eGFR 30–60 ml/min/1.73 m² with albuminuria > 20 mg/g and < 200 mg/g"; and "eGFR 30–60 ml/min/1.73 m² with CVD", but "was stopped early due to therapeutic futility and increased risk of stroke and adverse events". Consequently, "dual blockade of the RAS with direct renin inhibition and either ACE-I or ARB cannot be recommended". The manufacturer "recommends that aliskiren be stopped" in diabetics on ACE-I or ARB, and "in April 2012 the U.S. FDA announced a new contraindication against the use of aliskiren with ACE-Is or ARBs in patients with diabetes" due to risks including "kidney impairment, hypotension, and hyperkalemia".

### Mechanisms underlying the blood pressure-lowering effects of empagliflozin, losartan and their combination in people with type 2 diabetes: a secondary analysis of a randomized crossover trial [^113oH83R]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

2.3 Randomization and intervention

Participants were randomized to crossover sequences for empagliflozin 10 mg + losartan 50 mg combination therapy, empagliflozin monotherapy, losartan monotherapy and placebo (block size of four, performed by an independent trial pharmacist using computer‐generated numbers; Figure S1) (NCT04238702). Boehringer Ingelheim (Germany) provided the empagliflozin and matching empagliflozin placebo tablets. The losartan and losartan placebo tablet were bought at Tiofarma (Oud‐Beijerland, the Netherlands). The tablets were encapsulated, resulting in identical oral capsules (Trial Pharmacy, Amsterdam UMC, location AMC, Amsterdam, The Netherlands); encapsulation did not change pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics. Participants and investigators remained blinded to treatment status until database lock. Patients were instructed to take their study medication once daily at 08:00 PM during each treatment period. Adherence was followed up by counting the remaining capsules at all visits.

2.4 Endpoint measurements

All measurements were taken after 1 week of each treatment. The week before each kidney testing visit, participants adhered to a standardized sodium chloride (9‐12 g/d) diet to minimize variation in kidney physiology because of salt intake (compliance checked by 24‐h sodium collection) (Figure S1 B). After an overnight fast, patients arrived at 08:00 AM at the research unit. Prior to each measurement, patients were acclimatized for at least 10 minutes. All measurements were performed in the fasting state, in a semi‐supine position, and in a temperature‐controlled room (23.0 ± 1.0°C). Measurements were performed at the non‐dominant arm comfortably placed at heart level and appropriate cuff sizes were used where applicable.

What is losartan potassium tablet?

Losartan potassium tablet is a prescription medicine called an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB). It is used:

alone or with other blood pressure medicines to lower high blood pressure (hypertension).
to lower the chance of stroke in patients with high blood pressure and a heart problem called left ventricular hypertrophy. Losartan potassium tablets may not help Black patients with this problem.
to slow the worsening of diabetic kidney disease (nephropathy) in patients with type 2 diabetes who have or had high blood pressure.

Losartan potassium tablets have not been studied in children less than 6 years old or in children with certain kidney problems.

### Combination therapy is superior to sequential monotherapy for the initial treatment of hypertension: a double-blind randomized controlled trial [^1137caAg]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Eligible participants were randomly assigned at a ratio of 1:1 between monotherapy and combination therapy, but in practice, randomization was 1:1:2 to treatment with 50 mg losartan, or 12.5 mg HCTZ, as first monotherapy, versus 50 mg losartan plus 12.5 mg HCTZ combination therapy. In the monotherapy arms, there was forced dose‐doubling after 4 weeks of treatment, then participants crossed over at 8 weeks to the alternative drug at the lower dose, which was again force‐titrated to twice the dose after a further 4 weeks. In the combination arm, the successive dose permutations at every 4 weeks after initial assignment were losartan/HCTZ 50/25, 100/12.5, and 100/25 mg. After 16 weeks (start of phase 2), all participants received the combination of losartan 100 mg plus HCTZ 12.5 mg. At week 24, all participants were force‐titrated to losartan 100 mg plus HCTZ 25 mg. At week 32 (start of phase 3), amlodipine was added if systolic BP was > 140 mm Hg or diastolic BP was > 90 mm Hg. There were 2 subsequent opportunities for addition or titration of amlodipine, to 10 mg, with doxazosin 4 to 8 mg as a permitted alternative or addition, as required. The study ended at 52 weeks.

Losartan and HCTZ tablets were reencapsulated in identical gelatin capsules backfilled with microcrystalline cellulose and magnesium stearate, which was also used for the matching placebo capsules. All patients received 2 capsules throughout phase 1, in double‐dummy fashion, to maintain masking in the combination and monotherapy groups. Emergency code breaks via the central Interactive Voice Response System were available if deemed absolutely necessary. In phases 2 and 3, losartan and HCTZ were provided in a single tablet, the identity of which was known to investigators and patients; however, masking of the initial assignment was maintained until database lock.

Adherence to study medication was assessed by return tablet count.

Home BP was measured using the Microlife WatchBP Home monitor on the last 4 days before each clinic visit. This was used instead of ambulatory BP monitoring to improve patient acceptability and to minimize dropouts.

### Drug-drug interactions that reduce the formation of pharmacologically active metabolites: a poorly understood problem in clinical practice [^114vGmo1]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Drug-drug interactions can lead to reduced efficacy of medical treatment. Therapeutic failure may for instance result from combined treatment with an inhibitor of the specific pathway that is responsible for the generation of pharmacologically active drug metabolites. This problem may be overlooked in clinical practice. Several examples of drugs will be discussed -clopidogrel, losartan, tamoxifen and codeine - to illustrate differences in the potential impact on drug treatment in clinical practice. We conclude that the combined use of cytochrome P450-blocking serotonin reuptake inhibitors and tamoxifen or codeine should be avoided, whereas the situation is much more complex regarding the use of proton pump inhibitors together with clopidogrel, and the evidence regarding cytochrome P450 inhibitor-dependent activation of losartan is inconclusive.

Patients receiving the combination of losartan and lisinopril did not obtain any additional benefit compared to monotherapy for the combined endpoint of decline in GFR, end stage renal disease, or death, but experienced an increased incidence of hyperkalemia and acute kidney injury compared with the monotherapy group.

In most patients no benefit has been associated with using two RAS inhibitors concomitantly. In general, avoid combined use of RAS inhibitors. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function, and electrolytes in patients on Losartan potassium and other agents that affect the RAS.

### Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in hypertension: to use or Not to use? [^115tMHxs]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Most guidelines for the management of patients with cardiovascular disease recommend angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors as first-choice therapy, whereas angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are merely considered an alternative for ACE inhibitor-intolerant patients. The aim of this review was to compare outcomes and adverse events between ACE inhibitors and ARBs in patients. In patients with hypertension and hypertension with compelling indications, we found no difference in efficacy between ARBs and ACE inhibitors with regard to the surrogate endpoint of blood pressure and outcomes of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, and end-stage renal disease. However, ACE inhibitors remain associated with cough and a very low risk of angioedema and fatalities. Overall withdrawal rates because of adverse events are lower with ARBs than with ACE inhibitors. Given the equal outcome efficacy but fewer adverse events with ARBs, risk-to-benefit analysis in aggregate indicates that at present there is little, if any, reason to use ACE inhibitors for the treatment of hypertension or its compelling indications.

### A randomized, open-label, dose-response study of losartan in hypertensive children [^112YKdaY]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Once-daily losartan reduces BP in a dose-dependent manner and is well tolerated in hypertensive children aged 6–16 years. This study assessed the dose-response relationship, safety, and tolerability of losartan in hypertensive children aged 6 months to 6 years.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

This was a 12-week, randomized, open-label, dose-ranging study, with a 2-year extension. Patients were randomized to losartan at the following dosages: 0.1 mg/kg per day (low), 0.3 mg/kg per day (medium), or 0.7 mg/kg per day (high). Losartan was titrated to the next dose level (to a 1.4 mg/kg per day maximum dosage, not exceeding 100 mg/d, which was not one of the three original doses offered at randomization) at weeks 3, 6, and 9 for patients who did not attain their goal BP and were not taking the highest dose. Dose response was evaluated by analyzing the slope of change in sitting systolic BP (SBP; primary end point) and diastolic BP (DBP; secondary end point) after 3 weeks compared with baseline. Adverse events (AEs) were recorded throughout.

Results

Of the 101 patients randomized, 99 were included in the analysis (low dose, n = 32; medium dose, n = 34; and high dose, n = 33). Mean sitting BP decreased from baseline in the low-, medium-, and high-dose groups by 7.3, 7.6, and 6.7 mmHg, respectively, for SBP and 8.2, 5.1, and 6.7 mmHg, respectively, for DBP after 3 weeks. No dose-response relationship was established by the slope analysis on SBP (P = 0.75) or DBP (P = 0.64). The BP-lowering effect was observed throughout the 2-year extension. The incidence of AEs was low and comparable between groups.

Conclusions

Hypertensive children aged 6 months to 6 years treated with losartan 0.1–0.7 mg/kg per day had clinically significant decreases from baseline in SBP and DBP, yet no dose-response relationship was evident. Losartan, at a dosage up to 1.4 mg/kg per day, was well tolerated.

### Effects of losartan vs candesartan in reducing cardiovascular events in the primary treatment of hypertension [^111pfN7D]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2010). Low credibility.

When including patients over a longer time span, the possibility of variations in the patient handling may be a confounder. For example, an important potential confounding factor could have been variation in hypertensive treatment, favouring inclusion either in the losartan or candesartan group. The annual frequency of inclusion to the losartan or candesartan group from 1999 to 2007 was, however, similar. This suggests that there was a similar assessment of hypertensive patients with no differences between groups regarding the time point of inclusion.

Some confounders are difficult to measure and therefore not usable in a survival model. These confounders may have changed the baseline risk among the patients (that are the recording of diagnoses, new indications, reimbursement, guidelines, marketing, and shift in the ICD system or continuous updating of the software for electronic patient journal systems). Adjusting for all these potential confounders is difficult and we, therefore, made adjustments for the year of index prescription to minimize the possible effects of temporal changes with regard to the above parameters.

We tested this for the AIIA losartan using a prospective single-blind randomized design in patients with proteinuria (> 1 g/24 h) due to non-diabetic chronic renal failure (stable creatinine clearance > 20 ml/min) and mild to moderate hypertension (130/80 < blood pressure < 160/110 mmHg). Twenty-one patients were randomized into two groups: group A received losartan 50 mg daily for 4 weeks, then 100 mg daily for 4 weeks; group B received losartan 50 mg daily for 8 weeks. Twenty-four hour ambulatory blood pressure and renal parameters were measured at baseline and at 4 and 8 weeks of treatment.

Results

Overall there was a 7 ± 2 mmHg fall (mean ± SEM) in mean daytime systolic blood pressure at 4 weeks, and a 22 ± 7% fall in protein/creatinine ratio (both P < 0.05), with no difference between groups A and B or between 4 and 8 weeks. These two changes were highly correlated (r = 0.64, P = 0.006, taking both groups together). Changes in diastolic pressure and in night-time systolic pressure did not reach statistical significance. Changes in renal plasma flow (measured by Tc 99m MAGIII), glomerular filtration rate and filtration fraction (measured by 51Cr EDTA) did not reach statistical significance, did not differ between the two groups and did not correlate with effects on proteinuria.

Conclusion

This study provides no evidence that the effect of losartan on proteinuria has a non-haemodynamic component.

### Mechanisms underlying the blood pressure-lowering effects of empagliflozin, losartan and their combination in people with type 2 diabetes: a secondary analysis of a randomized crossover trial [^115DU3u3]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

At the time of diagnosis, approximately 60% of people living with type 2 diabetes (T2D) experience hypertension. Hypertension is a major independent risk factor for stroke and death. This may, at least partly, be explained through activation of the renin angiotensin system (RAS) and the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), both of which are associated with macrovascular dysfunction, including increased arterial stiffness and increased vascular tone.

Blockade of the RAS pathways with angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) improves cardiovascular (CV) and kidney outcomes in people with T2D. ARBs act by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor. In addition, ARBs promote renal sodium and water excretion by decreasing aldosterone secretion. Besides their well‐known antihypertensive properties, achieved by blocking the vasoconstrictive actions of angiotensin II, ARBs improve endothelial functionand vascular tone. Finally, ARBs reduce the collagen content of the arteries and attenuate extracellular matrix remodelling, thereby improving arterial distensibility.

Over the last few years, sodium‐glucose co‐transporter‐2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have been introduced as a therapeutic option for T2D management. These agents induce glycosuria, thereby reducing hyperglycaemia, and reduce the risks of CV disease and end‐stage kidney disease in people with or without diabetes and in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD). In addition to their glucose‐lowering effect, SGLT2 inhibitors lower systolic blood pressure (SBP) with an average of 4 mmHg. The mechanisms underlying their blood pressure‐lowering effect remain incompletely understood, but haemodynamic actions including volume contraction could contribute. Because the reductions in blood pressure occur without a compensating increase in heart rate (HR), it has been suggested that SGLT2 inhibitors reduce SNS activity. Furthermore, improvements in arterial stiffness and endothelial function have been proposed to contribute to the reduction in blood pressure.

As SGLT2 inhibitors and RAS blockers are progressively used in combination in people with diabetes, it is of interest to assess their combined effect on blood pressure and systemic haemodynamic function, in particular as their mechanism of action is different, which could result in complementary beneficial actions. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the mechanisms underlying the blood pressure reduction with the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin, the ARB losartan, and the empagliflozin + losartan combination compared with placebo in people with T2D.

### Current status of angiotensin receptor blocker recalls [^1175NPLx]. Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Losartan was the ninth most prescribed drug in the United States in 2016, and several other angiotensin-II receptor blockers (ARBs) are widely prescribed. Since July 2018, > 2 dozen specific ARB products have been recalled owing to the presence of potentially carcinogenic nitrosamine impurities in selected lots. As is the case with all U.S. drug recalls, the ARB recalls have been voluntary on the part of the companies involved. In April 2019, the Food and Drug Administration categorized marketed ARB products with respect to nitrosamine impurities: (1) not present, (2) to be determined with no prior lots removed from the market (TBD), or (3) to be determined in the context of prior lots having been removed from the market (TBD*). The data were structured as hundreds of rows of products. Owing to the complexity of these data, more than a year into the recalls, it remains difficult for clinicians to understand which ARB products are free of impurities.

7.1 Agents Increasing Serum Potassium

Coadministration of losartan with other drugs that raise serum potassium levels may result in hyperkalemia. Monitor serum potassium in such patients.

7.2 Lithium

Increases in serum lithium concentrations and lithium toxicity have been reported during concomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin II receptor antagonists. Monitor serum lithium levels during concomitant use.

7.3 Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) Including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors)

In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, coadministration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists (including losartan) may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving losartan and NSAID therapy.

The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including losartan, may be attenuated by NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors.

7.4 Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS)

Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, syncope, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy.

The Veterans Affairs Nephropathy in Diabetes (VA NEPHRON-D) trial enrolled 1448 patients with type 2 diabetes, elevated urinary-albumin-to-creatinine ratio, and decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR 30 to 89.9 mL/min), randomized them to lisinopril or placebo on a background of losartan therapy and followed them for a median of 2.2 years. Patients receiving the combination of losartan and lisinopril did not obtain any additional benefit compared to monotherapy for the combined endpoint of decline in GFR, end stage renal disease, or death, but experienced an increased incidence of hyperkalemia and acute kidney injury compared with the monotherapy group.

In most patients no benefit has been associated with using two RAS inhibitors concomitantly. In general, avoid combined use of RAS inhibitors. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function, and electrolytes in patients on losartan potassium tablets and other agents that affect the RAS.

Do not coadminister aliskiren with losartan potassium tablets in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with losartan potassium tablets in patients with renal impairment (GFR < 60 mL/min).

### A real-world toxicity atlas shows that adverse events of combination therapies commonly result in additive interactions [^114CZiKm]. Clinical Cancer Research (2024). Medium credibility.

To compare the AEs of all combination therapies to the ones that are known to give undesired interactions in the clinic, we used the clinical knowledgebase called the Pharmacotherapeutic Compass, a Dutch information portal for clinical use (ref.; data extraction method is shown in Supplementary Fig. S5A). We argued that these drug combinations might lead to synergistic interactions that might prevail over additive interactions. To test this idea, we performed a synergy analysis of 140 drug combinations that are known to induce 629 AE interactions. Focusing on 20 unique drug combinations that were most highly covered and matched to 49 unique AEs present in both datasets of FAERS and Pharmacotherapeutic Compass, the results showed 6% to 35% synergistic drug interactions (Fig. 5D). Some drug combinations were unequally (i.e. over)represented because they were matched to multiple records with various levels of clinical evidence from very rarely to very often (Fig. 5E). For example, hydrochlorothiazide & losartan presented synergistic responses for the AE on urinary tract infections recorded with an occurrence of "sometimes" and "often" for cough (Fig. 5F). Also, we plotted the top 15 drug combinations with the highest BLISS ratio that are used in oncology to assess the interaction type for this medical domain (Supplementary Fig. S6). The analysis, therefore, confirms the previous findings that additivity is the commonly seen drug interaction type, even when applied to more stringently selected drug combinations that are known to interact. All observed synergistic cases showed a mild level of interaction (Fig. 5E and F). The results of this analysis are provided in Supplementary Table S12. An example of how these values based on contingency tables is given in Supplementary Table S13.

### Renin angiotensin aldosterone system blockade: little to No rationale for ACE inhibitor and ARB combinations [^111LLsb8]. The American Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Our understanding of the complexities and inter-related pathways of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system continues to evolve. Which drugs to use, when, and how, are everyday questions faced by clinicians in the ambulatory setting. Combining these classes, for the purpose of enhancing renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockade and incremental blood pressure, nephroprotective, and cardioprotective effects, logically has emerged as an area for scientific inquiry and clinical use. Despite the lack of evidence on safety and efficacy in most disease states, dual therapy has been embraced as a treatment option. Most studies of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) combination therapy in the treatment of hypertension have limitations. In contrast, combination ACE inhibitor-ARB therapy in systolic heart failure has been addressed in several large randomized controlled trials. Until recently, there has been limited and conflicting evidence for the use of combination therapy for the prevention or management of nephropathy. Based on the new evidence, combination ACE inhibitor-ARB therapy in the treatment and management of hypertension, heart failure, and nephropathy should be limited.

Background

Angiotensin receptor blockers are antihypertensive medications prescribed by a wide variety of physicians, especially for patients with coexistent diabetes mellitus. Angiotensin receptor blockers, as well as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, are contraindicated in pregnancy.

Case

We describe the reversal of losartan-induced oligohydramnios at 27 weeks of gestation with subsequent development of fetal thrombosis and possible mechanism of action for this extremely rare in utero complication.

Conclusion

This theory may help explain the fetal stillbirths in women taking this class of medications during the second and third trimester of pregnancy.

### Beta-blockers for hypertension [^111hT6MM]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

It may be that only people with complicated hypertension or advanced disease are included in most studies, thereby ignoring the possible differing benefits of different antihypertensive medications on different organs and on different stages of disease development (Zanchetti 2005). A further problem is that in the two groups of the studies we analysed, and especially in the case of the comparison with diuretics, there were discrepancies between the achieved blood pressure levels (Table 6), and even small blood pressure differences may be linked to significant differences in outcomes (Collins 1990; Staessen 2003). However, there were no consistent differences in the blood pressure reduction between beta‐blockers and the other agents used to explain the outcome differences we found (Table 6). Yet another limitation is that (due to the scarcity of relevant trials) we combined the potentially different classes of RAS inhibitors (i.e. ACE inhibitors (captopril and lisinopril) and ARB (losartan). However, we believe that the similarities between these agents as antihypertensive drugs outweigh any potential differences.

Potential biases in the review process

We minimised potential biases in the review process by adhering to the Cochrane guidelines (Higgins 2011). We conducted a comprehensive search for eligible studies, without limiting the search to a specific language. Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias in each included study.

### Renin inhibition with aliskiren: where are we now, and where are we going? [^1153eTLc]. Journal of Hypertension (2006). Low credibility.

With the development of aliskiren, blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) at the level of the interaction of renin with a substrate has become a clinical reality. This review covers the specific features of the first agent likely to achieve widespread clinical exposure, aliskiren. The potential of renin inhibition must be viewed in the context of the remarkable efficacy of both angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). The implications of blockade of the renin system at its rate-limiting step are reviewed, with the therapeutic implications for both the renin inhibitor employed alone or the renin inhibitor combined with an ACE inhibitor or ARB. The relevant and necessary studies are ongoing.

### Losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide (Hyzaar) [^117QoPag]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Losartan Potassium

Losartan inhibits the pressor effect of angiotensin II (as well as angiotensin I) infusions. A dose of 100 mg inhibits the pressor effect by about 85% at peak with 25–40% inhibition persisting for 24 hours. Removal of the negative feedback of angiotensin II causes a doubling to tripling in plasma renin activity and consequent rise in angiotensin II plasma concentration in hypertensive patients. Losartan does not affect the response to bradykinin, whereas ACE inhibitors increase the response to bradykinin. Aldosterone plasma concentrations fall following losartan administration. In spite of the effect of losartan on aldosterone secretion, very little effect on serum potassium was observed.

The effect of losartan is substantially present within one week but in some studies the maximal effect occurred in 3–6 weeks. In long-term follow-up studies (without placebo control) the effect of losartan appeared to be maintained for up to a year. There is no apparent rebound effect after abrupt withdrawal of losartan. There was essentially no change in average heart rate in losartan-treated patients in controlled trials.

Hydrochlorothiazide

After oral administration of hydrochlorothiazide, diuresis begins within 2 hours, peaks in about 4 hours, and lasts about 6 to 12 hours.

Drug Interactions

Hydrochlorothiazide

Alcohol, barbiturates, or narcotics — potentiation of orthostatic hypotension may occur.

Other antihypertensive drugs — additive effect or potentiation.

Skeletal muscle relaxants, nondepolarizing (e.g., tubocurarine) — possible increased responsiveness to the muscle relaxant.

Corticosteroids, ACTH, or glycyrrhizin (found in liquorice) — intensified electrolyte depletion, particularly hypokalemia.

Pressor amines (e.g., norepinephrine) — possible decreased response to pressor amines but not sufficient to preclude their use.

Absorption: Following oral administration, losartan is well absorbed and undergoes substantial first-pass metabolism. The systemic bioavailability of losartan is approximately 33%. Mean peak concentrations of losartan and its active metabolite are reached in 1 hour and in 3–4 hours, respectively. While maximum plasma concentrations of losartan and its active metabolite are approximately equal, the AUC (area under the curve) of the metabolite is about 4 times as great as that of losartan. A meal slows absorption of losartan and decreases its Cmaxbut has only minor effects on losartan AUC or on the AUC of the metabolite (~10% decrease). The pharmacokinetics of losartan and its active metabolite are linear with oral losartan doses up to 200 mg and do not change over time.

### Guidance for incorporating FDA processes into the ACC / AHA clinical practice guideline methodology: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^116AYhpp]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Table 26 — enalaprilat (ACE inhibitor) for hypertensive emergencies lists "Initial 1.25 mg over a 5-min period. Doses can be increased up to 5 mg every 6 h as needed to achieve BP target. Adjust rate up to total cumulative dose of 50 mg/24 h", and warns "Contraindicated in pregnancy and should not be used in acute MI or bilateral renal artery stenosis. Mainly useful in hypertensive emergencies associated with high plasma renin activity. Poorly defined dose adjustments for kidney failure and may worsen kidney injury in those with CKD. Relatively slow onset of action (15 min) and unpredictability of BP response".

### Effects of losartan vs candesartan in reducing cardiovascular events in the primary treatment of hypertension [^1141mNnr]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2010). Low credibility.

In this study, the initial and continued use of thiazides was more frequent in the losartan group compared to the candesartan group. The increased use of thiazides in the losartan group support reports of an improved blood pressure lowering effect with candesartan compared with losartan when given as monotherapy. Recently, the LIFE study group reported that concomitant thiazide therapy was associated with reduced cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, independent of blood pressure and electrocardiographic evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy. Consequently, the use of more concomitant thiazide treatment in patients treated with losartan should therefore have potentially reduced CVD risk in this group. Other concomitant antihypertensive treatments (calcium channel blocker and β-blocker) did not differ during the observation period. We have therefore no reason to believe that the use of additional antihypertensive drugs could have influenced our results.
