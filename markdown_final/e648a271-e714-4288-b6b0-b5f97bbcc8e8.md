## Question

Are Risperidone and Quetiapine commonly used antipsychotics for aggression in dementia patients?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether risperidone and quetiapine are commonly used antipsychotics for aggression in dementia, and how their use aligns with the available evidence and guidelines. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about real-world prescribing patterns and whether these agents are indeed commonly used. Then, I should verify the regulatory status and labeled indications. Next, I will review the comparative efficacy and safety data, especially mortality and cerebrovascular risks. After that, I need to check guideline positions on when and how to use these drugs. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk–benefit conclusion and monitoring plan, making sure I double-check any conflicting claims along the way.

> Let me first confirm real-world use patterns, because "commonly used" is a descriptive claim that should be anchored in data. Large observational cohorts show quetiapine is the most frequently initiated antipsychotic for agitation in dementia, followed by risperidone, with quetiapine around 35% and risperidone around 20% of new starts, which supports the premise that both are indeed commonly used in practice [^116jgK9C] [^111wDJ3D]. Wait, let me verify whether this holds across settings; yes, these figures span residential and community-based care, and quetiapine's prominence is consistent with other real-world analyses as well [^115C8tdx] [^111wDJ3D].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about appropriateness just because they are commonly prescribed. I need to check the regulatory status. In the United States, neither risperidone nor quetiapine is approved for dementia-related psychosis or aggression, and both carry boxed warnings for increased mortality in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis, which means all use here is off-label and requires explicit risk–benefit justification and informed consent [^111uvqnW] [^116DGPPi] [^114DcgFB]. I should confirm international differences; risperidone has short-term approval for severe BPSD in several countries (e.g. UK, Canada, Australia), but that does not change the US regulatory stance, so the risk framework remains the same in the US context [^116DGPPi].

> Next, I should review efficacy, and I need to be careful to separate signal by symptom domain. Risperidone has the most consistent evidence for reducing aggression in Alzheimer's and mixed dementias, with randomized trials and meta-analyses showing modest but statistically significant improvements, often at low doses around 1 mg/day, and with early response by week 2 predicting sustained benefit at weeks 4–8 [^112q9By7] [^1111xXVD] [^116F3g2v] [^114hGhKF]. Quetiapine's efficacy is more variable across trials; some studies show modest benefit at higher doses (e.g., 200 mg/day), while others are negative, and overall its effect size for agitation is smaller and less reliable than risperidone's for aggression, which aligns with head-to-head effectiveness data and network meta-analyses [^114JtPmV] [^114PoC9D].

> I will now examine safety, because this is where the balance often shifts. Meta-analyses consistently show increased mortality with atypical antipsychotics in dementia, with a pooled odds ratio around 1.5–1.7, and dose-related mortality signals have been replicated in large observational cohorts; cerebrovascular events are also more frequent, and extrapyramidal symptoms are more common with risperidone than quetiapine, whereas quetiapine causes more sedation and orthostatic effects, increasing fall risk [^115gZhha] [^112XqZWE] [^1117Ew5z] [^115WU7zA]. Wait, I should double-check the EPS comparison; yes, multiple analyses rank quetiapine lower for EPS than risperidone, which is clinically relevant in Parkinsonian syndromes, though both remain off-label in the US for this indication [^115WU7zA].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to ensure my recommendations align with best practice. Major guidelines converge on a hierarchical approach: prioritize nonpharmacologic interventions first, reserve antipsychotics for severe aggression or psychosis that poses risk or significant distress, start low and go slow, reassess frequently, and attempt dose reduction or discontinuation within about 3–4 months if feasible. Risperidone is generally preferred when an antipsychotic is necessary due to stronger efficacy data, while quetiapine may be considered when EPS risk must be minimized or risperidone is not tolerated, albeit with weaker efficacy and higher sedation risk [^111YgjJr] [^112kzRYg] [^111yPKvn] [^116jgK9C] [^117HxWTY]. I should confirm that this applies across settings. Yes, APA and EAN guidance emphasize indication-specific, time-limited use with shared decision-making and close monitoring for harms [^111YgjJr] [^111561ds].

> But wait, what if the aggression is driven by delirium, pain, or environmental triggers? I need to ensure we are not masking reversible causes. Guidelines stress identifying and treating medical, environmental, and psychosocial precipitants before or alongside any pharmacotherapy, and to optimize cholinesterase inhibitors or memantine when indicated, because addressing drivers of behavior can obviate the need for antipsychotics or reduce required doses and duration [^111YgjJr] [^112hzVdL] [^114DcgFB]. Hold on, I should verify that this principle is consistently emphasized; yes, it is a recurring theme across APA and EAN documents and is essential to safe, effective care pathways [^111YgjJr] [^114DcgFB].

> Let me synthesize and make sure I am not overstating anything. Yes, risperidone and quetiapine are commonly used for dementia-related aggression in real-world practice, with quetiapine the most frequently prescribed antipsychotic and risperidone the second most common, despite both being off-label in the US and carrying boxed warnings for increased mortality; risperidone has the strongest and most consistent evidence for reducing aggression but confers higher EPS risk, whereas quetiapine has weaker and more inconsistent efficacy but less EPS and more sedation and falls, so agent selection should be individualized and time-limited with explicit risk–benefit documentation and caregiver counseling [^115C8tdx] [^111wDJ3D] [^111uvqnW] [^112XqZWE] [^112q9By7] [^114PoC9D] [^115WU7zA]. I should confirm that guidelines advise periodic attempts to taper; yes, APA recommends reassessing and attempting reduction within months when clinically safe, which should be built into the care plan from the outset [^111YgjJr] [^111yPKvn].

> Finally, I need to ensure practical safeguards are explicit. Before initiating, obtain informed consent discussing mortality, stroke, EPS, falls, and metabolic risks. Start at low doses (e.g., risperidone 0.25–0.5 mg/day, quetiapine 12.5–50 mg/day) and titrate cautiously. Monitor for sedation, orthostasis, EPS, metabolic changes, and cognitive effects. Reassess efficacy and adverse effects within 2–4 weeks. And if there is inadequate response after a reasonable trial (often 4–8 weeks), consider switching to an alternative agent or class rather than simply escalating dose, keeping total duration as short as possible and planning a taper if symptoms remit [^1122DEFA] [^111YgjJr]. Hold on, I should verify that early response predicts later benefit for risperidone; yes, IPD meta-analyses suggest that improvement by week 2 strongly predicts response at weeks 4 and 8, which can guide early discontinuation decisions if no benefit emerges [^114hGhKF].

Risperidone and quetiapine are the **most commonly used antipsychotics** for aggression in dementia, with risperidone having the **strongest evidence** [^115C8tdx] and guideline support for short-term use when nonpharmacologic measures fail [^114DcgFB] [^117HxWTY]. Quetiapine is often used when extrapyramidal symptoms are a concern [^1165H29z], but its evidence is weaker and sedation is common [^114JtPmV]. Both carry **increased mortality and cerebrovascular risks** [^115gZhha] [^114DcgFB], so use should be limited to severe aggression after nonpharmacologic interventions, at the lowest effective dose, and for the shortest duration with regular monitoring and attempts to taper [^111yPKvn] [^1124e66b].

---

## Clinical evidence for risperidone and quetiapine

Risperidone has the **most robust evidence** for reducing aggression in dementia, with multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses demonstrating efficacy [^116iVCCS]:

Quetiapine is frequently used, particularly when EPS are a concern, but its evidence base is **less consistent**:

| **Aspect** | **Risperidone** | **Quetiapine** |
|-|-|-|
| Efficacy | Risperidone significantly reduces aggression and psychosis in dementia, with effect sizes around 0.2–0.3 [^1111xXVD] | Mixed results; some studies show modest benefits, others none [^114JtPmV] [^114PoC9D] |
| Dose | Effective doses are typically 0.5–1 mg/day, balancing efficacy and extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) [^1122DEFA] | Typical doses are 25–100 mg/day, with sedation limiting titration [^1122DEFA] [^111BHzX2] |
| Limitations | Increased risk of EPS, cerebrovascular events, and mortality limit use to short-term treatment [^116F3g2v] [^1122K7Wz] | Sedation, orthostatic hypotension, and metabolic effects are common; mortality risk remains a concern [^111BHzX2] [^1135QPG5] [^115gZhha] |

---

## Comparative effectiveness and safety

Head-to-head and network meta-analyses show **no clear superiority** of one antipsychotic over another for aggression in dementia [^114PoC9D] [^114X7ejC]. Risperidone has **greater EPS risk**, whereas quetiapine causes more sedation and orthostatic hypotension [^115WU7zA] [^115pXTdX]. Both are associated with increased mortality and cerebrovascular events, with risperidone showing a higher signal in some analyses [^114DcgFB] [^1117Ew5z].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines consistently recommend **nonpharmacologic interventions first**, reserving antipsychotics for severe aggression or when nonpharmacologic measures fail [^111YgjJr] [^1124e66b]:

- **First-line**: Nonpharmacologic strategies (environmental modifications, caregiver education, behavioral interventions) [^112kzRYg].
- **Second-line**: Risperidone for short-term use (≤ 12 weeks) at low doses with close monitoring [^116jgK9C] [^117HxWTY].
- **Alternative**: Quetiapine when risperidone is contraindicated or not tolerated, acknowledging weaker evidence [^114JtPmV] [^1165H29z].
- **Monitoring**: Regular assessment of efficacy, adverse effects, and attempts to taper/discontinue when possible [^111yPKvn] [^1145kX8T].

---

## Real-world prescribing patterns

Real-world data show risperidone and quetiapine are the **most commonly prescribed antipsychotics** for dementia-related aggression, with risperidone slightly more frequent in some cohorts and quetiapine in others [^115C8tdx] [^115pXTdX]. Prescribing varies by setting, patient characteristics, and clinician preference, reflecting the lack of definitive superiority of one agent [^114X7ejC].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing choice

- **Comorbidities**: Parkinson's disease or Lewy body dementia favor quetiapine due to lower EPS risk [^115WU7zA].
- **Side-effect profile**: Sedation, orthostatic hypotension, and metabolic effects guide selection and dosing [^112TqgWk].
- **Severity**: Severe aggression or psychosis may warrant risperidone given stronger evidence, with careful monitoring [^1111xXVD].

---

## Conclusion and clinical implications

Risperidone and quetiapine are the **most commonly used antipsychotics** for aggression in dementia, with risperidone supported by stronger evidence and guidelines for short-term use [^1111xXVD] [^116jgK9C]. Quetiapine is a reasonable alternative when EPS are a concern, but its efficacy is less consistent and sedation is common [^114JtPmV]. Both carry significant risks, including increased mortality and cerebrovascular events, so use should be restricted to severe cases, at the lowest effective dose, with regular monitoring and attempts to taper or discontinue when possible [^115gZhha] [^111YgjJr].

Geriatric patients with dementia frequently present with agitation, aggression, psychosis, and other behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). We present an update of our previously published algorithms for the use of psychopharmacologic agents in these patients taking into account more recent studies and findings in meta-analyses, reviews, and other published algorithms. We propose three algorithms: BPSD in an emergent, urgent, and non-urgent setting. In the emergent setting when intramuscular (IM) administration is necessary, the first-line recommendation is for olanzapine (since IM aripiprazole, previously favored, is no longer available) and haloperidol injection is the second choice, followed by possible consideration of an IM benzodiazepine. In the urgent setting, the first line would be oral second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) aripiprazole and risperidone. Perhaps next could be then prazosin, and lastly electroconvulsive therapy is a consideration. There are risks associated with these agents, and adverse effects can be severe. Dosing strategies, discontinuation considerations, and side effects are discussed. In the non-emergent setting, medications are proposed for use in the following order: trazodone, donepezil and memantine, antidepressants such as escitalopram and sertraline, SGAs, prazosin, and carbamazepine. Other options with less support but potential future promise are discussed.

Clinical Question Which medications are effective at decreasing agitation in patients with dementia. Evidence-Based Answer Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and risperidone are moderately effective at decreasing agitation in all types of dementia. Olanzapine and risperidone reduce dementia-related agitation much longer than placebo. Dextromethorphan/quinidine was also more effective than placebo, but it was evaluated in only one RCT. A 2011 Cochrane review assessed the safety and effectiveness of antidepressants for agitation in adults who had one of several different types of dementia, analyzing nine RCTs with a total of 692 patients.

One trial comparing citalopram and risperidone measured change on the Neurobehavioral Rating Scale and showed similar effectiveness and no significant difference in withdrawal because of adverse effects. 3 The interventions were equally effective in treating agitation in patients with Alzheimer-type dementia and citalopram was associated with fewer adverse outcomes than quetiapine and olanzapine. A 2006 double-blind RCT examined 421 outpatients with Alzheimer dementia and psychosis, aggression, or agitation who were randomly assigned to receive olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, or placebo.

Recommendations from Others The American Psychiatric Association supports the use of nonemergency antipsychotic treatment for behavioral/psychological symptoms of dementia after assessing for pain and exhausting nonpharmacologic options, and when symptoms are severe, dangerous, or cause significant distress to the patient. They recommend starting at a low dosage and discontinuing therapy for severe adverse effects or lack of improvement at four weeks. Even if treatment is effective, an attempt to taper should be made at four months. 5 Copyright © Family Physicians Inquiries Network. Used with permission.

### Sequential drug treatment algorithm for agitation and aggression in Alzheimer's and mixed dementia [^115jD1wx]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) include agitation and aggression in people with dementia. BPSD is common on inpatient psychogeriatric units and may prevent individuals from living at home or in residential/nursing home settings. Several drugs and non-pharmacological treatments have been shown to be effective in reducing behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia. Algorithmic treatment may address the challenge of synthesizing this evidence-based knowledge.

Methods

A multidisciplinary team created evidence-based algorithms for the treatment of behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia. We present drug treatment algorithms for agitation and aggression associated with Alzheimer's and mixed Alzheimer's/vascular dementia. Drugs were appraised by psychiatrists based on strength of evidence of efficacy, time to onset of clinical effect, tolerability, ease of use, and efficacy for indications other than behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia.

Results

After baseline assessment and discontinuation of potentially exacerbating medications, sequential trials are recommended with risperidone, aripiprazole or quetiapine, carbamazepine, citalopram, gabapentin, and prazosin. Titration schedules are proposed, with adjustments for frailty. Additional guidance is given on use of electroconvulsive therapy, optimization of existing cholinesterase inhibitors/memantine, and use of pro re nata medications.

Conclusion

This algorithm-based approach for drug treatment of agitation/aggression in Alzheimer's/mixed dementia has been implemented in several Canadian Hospital Inpatient Units. Impact should be assessed in future research.

Concluding, at least two‐thirds of physicians selected at least one identical treatment for the four following behavioural symptoms: physical aggression, verbal aggression, obsessive delusions and impulsivity. These were also the four symptoms with a mean rank (i.e. WS) higher than 1.5, namely for two antipsychotics, emphasizing the consistency in physician preferences for these specific symptoms.

Figure 4 shows the PCA. The first component of the PCA captures 67.4% of the dataset variance, whilst the second dimension accounts for 18.4%. The first dimension primarily represents a size effect, with all symptom coefficients being positive: treatments located further to the right on the figure exhibit higher citation counts. Conversely, the second dimension distinguishes between treatments with similar citation patterns based on difference in target symptoms.

FIGURE 4
Results of the PCA based on the percentage of physicians who selected a treatment, regardless of its rank, using the treatments as observations and the behavioural disturbances as variables. PCA, principal components analysis.

Based on the PCA, sertraline and (es)citalopram are close and thus similarly recommended for hyperphagia, perseverative somatic complaints and rigidity of thought, whereas they are rarely suggested for physical aggression and nightly unrest. These two treatments are also endorsed for apathy and loss of empathy, alongside bupropion and fluoxetine. Quetiapine and risperidone are frequently co‐cited, particularly for nightly unrest and physical aggression (with olanzapine for physical aggression), but are seldom mentioned for hyperphagia, perseverative somatic complaints and rigidity of thought. For other symptoms, although quetiapine and risperidone are the most frequently cited, sertraline and (es)citalopram are also commonly recommended.

However, clustering is not able to encompass the remaining behavioural symptoms, i.e. impulsivity, motor unrest, sexual disinhibition, apathy and obsessive delusions. For these five symptoms either different drug classes or both SSRIs and antipsychotics are advised.

2.4 Outcome variables: the BEHAVE‐AD rating score

BPSD were assessed by the BEHAVE‐AD total scale and subscales at week 4 and week 8. The BEHAVE‐AD is a 25‐item scale consisting of seven subscales: (A) Paranoid and Delusional Ideation (7 items); (B) Hallucinations (5 items); (C) Activity Disturbances (3 items); (D) Aggressiveness (3 items); (E) Diurnal Rhythm Disturbances (1 item); (F) Affective Disturbances (2 items); and (G) Anxieties and Phobias (4 items). Each item of the BEHAVE‐AD scale was initially rated as absent (0) or present; if present, the severity was further classified into one of three categories, where 1 = present, 2 = present with emotional component, and 3 = present with both emotional and physical components. Additionally, a global rating assessed the overall impact of symptoms on patients and caregivers, scored from 0 (not at all) to 3 (severely). In this study, we defined psychosis as the combination of items in both subscale A and subscale B, consistent with the definition used in the original trial.BEHAVE‐AD scores were captured at baseline, as well as at week 2, 4, and 8. We analyzed BEHAVE‐AD scores as both dichotomous and continuous outcomes. A clinically significant therapeutic response was defined as a ≥ 30% reduction in the BEHAVE‐AD total score from baseline, assessed as a binary outcome. For continuous outcomes, we retained raw scores for the total scale, each individual subscale, and the global rating scale. An early response was defined as achieving the therapeutic response threshold by week 2, while any reduction in score from baseline at week 2 was classified as early improvement. Further details of the BEHAVE‐AD rating scale are provided in Appendix 1 in supporting information.

AB and psychotropic drug use

The use of neuroleptics was significantly associated with PAB, and both benzodiazepine and neuroleptics were linked to VAB. Other studies have found AB and psychotropic drugs such as neuroleptics and benzodiazepines to be associated. Conventional (e.g. haloperidol, thioridazine, chlorpromazine) and atypical (e.g. risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine) neuroleptics are frequently used in the treatment of agitation and AB among older residents. Three meta-analyses concluded that, despite their wide use, neuroleptics might reduce the frequency of disruptive behaviour by only 18% to 26% in older patients with dementia. Lonergan and colleagues report that haloperidol is not more effective than a placebo in controlling agitation among the elderly suffering from dementia and was slightly more effective than a placebo for AB. In addition, these drugs are associated with frequent adverse effects such as extra-pyramidal symptoms, drowsiness and anticholinergic manifestations. According to a one-year longitudinal study, researchers reported that change in disruptive behaviour occurs among nursing home residents regardless of the use of neuroleptic drugs, but that it occurs more frequently among those receiving neuroleptic medication. In fact, users of neuroleptics showed greater changes in both developing and resolving disruptive behaviour during the year than those not receiving the drugs. In short, given their limited effectiveness and the high risk of side effects, including permanent consequences such as tardive dyskinesia, the use of neuroleptic drugs should be a last resort

Benzodiazepines should also be used with caution among older residents. Liebson reported that these drugs exacerbate cognitive deficits in cognitively impaired residents. Finally, we are not aware of any controlled clinical trial on the effectiveness of benzodiazepine for treating aggressive behaviour among older residents with dementia. It is worth mentioning that since sleep disturbance and psychological distress (both associated with AB) are indications for the use of benzodiazepine drugs, there are, undoubtedly, a certain percentage of participants who were taking these drugs to treat said symptoms and not AB. Nonetheless, future studies should be directed toward the development of new drugs and alternative treatments such as the towel bath or staff training programs.

### Real-world treatment patterns and characteristics among patients with agitation and dementia in the United States: findings from a large, observational, retrospective chart review [^115C8tdx]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

The most common antipsychotic treatments initiated on the index date for the treatment of agitation related to dementia/AD were quetiapine (35.2%), risperidone (20.0%), and olanzapine (13.0%) (Fig. 2).

Fig. 2
Antipsychotic treatment received for the treatment of agitation related to dementia/Alzheimer's disease among patients with agitation and dementia initiated on an antipsychotic in residential care and community-based settings on the index date.* †. * Antipsychotic agents received on the index date were statistically different between residential care and community-based setting at the 5% level. † Other antipsychotic agents initiated on the index date included paliperidone (0.7%), olanzapine and fluoxetine (0.7%), aripiprazole lauroxil (0.6%), asenapine (0.4%), brexpiprazole (0.4%), chlorpromazine (0.4%), cariprazine (0.2%), loxapine (0.1%), and pimozide (0.1%). The index treatment was unknown for 1 patient (0.1%).

Antipsychotic discontinuation rates overall were significantly higher among patients with dementia and agitation in the residential care setting versus the community-based setting (log rank, p < 0.05). However, there was no significant difference in antipsychotic discontinuation rates at 30, 60, and 90 days (Fig. 3).

Fig. 3
Antipsychotic discontinuation rate among patients with agitation and dementia initiated on an antipsychotic in residential care and community-based settings.

The most frequent reasons for discontinuation of the antipsychotic treatment initiated on the index date among patients (n = 16) in the residential care setting were insufficient response (62.5%) and deterioration of patient's quality of life (31.3%). In contrast, among patients in the community-based setting (n = 11), non-severe adverse events (27.3%), and deterioration of patient's functional status (18.2%) were the most frequent reasons for antipsychotic discontinuation.

### Sequential drug treatment algorithm for agitation and aggression in Alzheimer's and mixed dementia [^1135QPG5]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2018). Low credibility.

Haloperidol (NbN: dopamine receptor antagonist)

Evidence exists for haloperidol in BPSD with a 2002 Cochrane review suggesting that its utility was limited to aggression. In a subsequent study, improvement in BPSD ascertained by the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory was equivalent to that associated with olanzapine. However, the panel was reluctant to recommend a conventional antipsychotic in an algorithm where patients may first have been prescribed two atypical antipsychotics. This view was motivated by safety concerns. Although a recent study reported that the NNH with haloperidol, for the outcome of mortality, was similar to risperidone, one large retrospective study of nursing home residents with dementia reported a significantly higher hazard ratio for all-cause mortality for new users of haloperidol compared with atypical antipsychotics. In another cohort study where a diagnosis of dementia was not required for inclusion, conventional antipsychotics significantly increased risk both of death and femur fracture in nursing home residents compared with atypicals.

Memantine (NbN: glutamate receptor antagonist)

This modulator of glutamatergic neurotransmission via N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA) receptor antagonism has evidence from a meta-analysis of a positive effect in agitation and aggression, but the observed difference was apparent only after six months of treatment. A further pooled analysis reported a benefit observable from 12 weeks. These analyses suggest that onset may be too slow to address acute behavioural disturbances in the inpatient setting. A more recent randomized trial suggested that in patients taking rivastigmine, addition of memantine conferred limited benefit in behavioural symptoms compared with placebo. Although neither memantine nor the acetylcholinesterase inhibitors have been included as treatment steps in the algorithm per se, are all purported to be effective treatments for temporarily slowing the general progression of Alzheimer's disease, and should be retained and if necessary dose-optimized for this purpose in parallel with the main algorithm.

Olanzapine (NbN: dopamine and serotonin receptor antagonist)

This antipsychotic was not included in the treatment sequence due to concerns relating to its metabolic profile and anticholinergic properties relative to the three atypical antipsychotic drugs that are included. Olanzapine has double-blind randomized trial evidence for BPSD in Alzheimer's dementia, but a meta-analysis of this and two other trials reported no difference from placebo on either measures specific to agitation or more general measures of neuropsychiatric symptoms.

### Quetiapine [^1171qJqv]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms that might be precursors to worsening depression or suicidality, especially if these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms.

Families and caregivers of patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder or other indications, both psychiatric and non-psychiatric, should be alerted about the need to monitor patients for the emergence of agitation, irritability, unusual changes in behavior, and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of suicidality, and to report such symptoms immediately to healthcare providers. Such monitoring should include daily observation by families and caregivers. Prescriptions for quetiapine should be written for the smallest quantity of tablets consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose.

Screening Patients for Bipolar Disorder: A major depressive episode may be the initial presentation of bipolar disorder. It is generally believed (though not established in controlled trials) that treating such an episode with an antidepressant alone may increase the likelihood of precipitation of a mixed/manic episode in patients at risk for bipolar disorder. Whether any of the symptoms described above represent such a conversion is unknown. However, prior to initiating treatment with an antidepressant, including quetiapine, patients with depressive symptoms should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder; such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and depression.

5.3 Cerebrovascular Adverse Reactions, Including Stroke, in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis

In placebo-controlled trials with risperidone, aripiprazole, and olanzapine in elderly subjects with dementia, there was a higher incidence of cerebrovascular adverse reactions (cerebrovascular accidents and transient ischemic attacks) including fatalities compared to placebo-treated subjects.

Quetiapine is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see also Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

### Antipsychotics for agitation and psychosis in people with Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia [^11534Av4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Typical and atypical antipsychotics are widely used to treat agitation and psychosis in dementia. However, whether or not they are beneficial is uncertain. Some trials have yielded negative results and effectiveness may be outweighed by harms.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of antipsychotics for the treatment of agitation and psychosis in people with Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia.

Search Methods

We searched ALOIS, the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's register, MEDLINE (Ovid Sp), Embase (Ovid SP), PsycINFO (Ovid SP), CINAHL (EBSCOhost), Web of Science Core Collection (ISI Web of Science), LILACS (BIREME), ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization's meta-register, and the International Clinical Trials Registry Portal on 7 January 2021. Two review authors independently screened the title and abstract of the hits, and two review authors assessed the full text of studies that got through this screening.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm trials comparing the effects of antipsychotics and placebo for the treatment of agitation or psychosis in people with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease or vascular dementia, or both, irrespective of age, severity of cognitive impairment, and setting. (The majority of) participants had to have clinically significant agitation (including aggression) or psychosis or both at baseline. We excluded studies about antipsychotics that are no longer available in the USA or EU, or that are used for emergency short-term sedation. We also excluded head-to-head trials and antipsychotic withdrawal trials.

Data Collection and Analysis

The primary outcomes were (1) reduction in agitation or psychosis in participants with agitation or psychosis, respectively at baseline, and (2) the number of participants with adverse events: somnolence, extrapyramidal symptoms, any adverse event, any serious adverse event (SAE), and death. Two review authors independently extracted the necessary data and assessed risk of bias with the Cochrane risk of bias tool. We calculated the pooled effect on agitation and psychosis for typical and atypical antipsychotics separately, and the pooled risk of adverse effects independent of the target symptom (agitation or psychosis). We used RevMan Web for the analyses.

Main Results

The search yielded 8233 separate hits. After assessing the full-text of 35 studies, we included 24 trials that met the eligibility criteria. Six trials tested a typical antipsychotic, four for agitation and two for psychosis. Twenty trials tested an atypical antipsychotic, eight for agitation and 12 for psychosis. Two trials tested both drug types. Seventeen of 26 comparisons were performed in patients with Alzheimer's disease specifically. The other nine comparisons also included patients with vascular dementia or mixed dementia. Together, the studies included 6090 participants (12 to 652 per study). The trials were performed in institutionalised, hospitalised and community-dwelling patients, or a combination of those. For typical antipsychotics (e.g. haloperidol, thiothixene), we are uncertain whether these drugs improve agitation compared with placebo (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.36, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.57 to -0.15, 4 studies, n = 361); very low-certainty evidence, but typical antipsychotics may improve psychosis slightly (SMD -0.29, 95% CI -0.55 to -0.03, 2studies, n = 240; low-certainty evidence) compared with placebo. These drugs probably increase the risk of somnolence (risk ratio (RR) 2.62, 95% CI 1.51 to 4.56, 3 studies, n = 466; moderate-certainty evidence) and increase extrapyramidal symptoms (RR 2.26, 95% CI 1.58 to 3.23, 3 studies, n = 467; high-certainty) evidence. There was no evidence regarding the risk of any adverse event. The risks of SAEs (RR 1.32, 95% CI 0.65 to 2.66, 1 study, n = 193) and death (RR 1.46, 95% CI 0.54 to 4.00, 6 studies, n = 578) may be increased slightly, but these estimates were very imprecise, and the certainty was low. The effect estimates for haloperidol from five trials were in line with those of the drug class. Atypical antipsychotics (e.g. risperidone, olanzapine, aripiprazole, quetiapine) probably reduce agitation slightly (SMD -0.21, 95% CI -0.30 to -0.12, 7 studies, n = 1971; moderate-certainty evidence), but probably have a negligible effect on psychosis (SMD -0.11, 95% CI -0.18 to -0.03, 12 studies, n = 3364; moderate-certainty evidence). These drugs increase the risk of somnolence (RR 1.93, 95% CI 1.57 to 2.39, 13 studies, n - 3878; high-certainty evidence) and are probably also associated with slightly increased risk of extrapyramidal symptoms (RR 1.39, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.68, 15 studies, n = 4180; moderate-certainty evidence), serious adverse events (RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.61, 15 studies, n = 4316; moderate-certainty evidence) and death (RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.90 to 2.05, 17 studies, n = 5032; moderate-certainty evidence), although the latter estimate was imprecise. The drugs probably have a negligible effect on the risk of any adverse event (RR 1.05, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.09, 11 studies, n = 2785; moderate-certainty evidence). The findings from seven trials for risperidone were in line with those for the drug class.

Authors' Conclusions

There is some evidence that typical antipsychotics might decrease agitation and psychosis slightly in patients with dementia. Atypical antipsychotics reduce agitation in dementia slightly, but their effect on psychosis in dementia is negligible. The apparent effectiveness of the drugs seen in daily practice may be explained by a favourable natural course of the symptoms, as observed in the placebo groups. Both drug classes increase the risk of somnolence and other adverse events. If antipsychotics are considered for sedation in patients with severe and dangerous symptoms, this should be discussed openly with the patient and legal representative.

Quetiapine for psychosis and agitation in dementia — placebo-controlled trials — showed variable outcomes: In a 10-week multicenter trial versus haloperidol among elderly nursing home patients, a subgroup of 284 with Alzheimer's disease had a mean daily haloperidol dosage of 2 mg/day and about 120 mg/day for quetiapine, with neither treatment differing on the primary psychosis outcome while one secondary agitation measure improved with both active drugs but not placebo; a subsequent placebo-controlled study in 333 nursing home residents tested 100 mg/day (achieved by day 4) or 200 mg/day (achieved by day 8) and found 200 mg/day superior to placebo on numerous outcomes with less benefit at 100 mg/day; however, a separate placebo-controlled trial in 93 subjects with Alzheimer's disease and agitation failed to show any benefit over placebo.

At day 21, when a CGI-I score of three (minimal improvement) is recorded, in the case of risperidone and quetiapine only (decision squares shaded red), an extension of up to 21 days may be initiated with a further "intermediate decision point" at day 28 or 29. For all other drugs, a score of three is considered an unsuccessful trial. For risperidone and quetiapine after an extension, CGI-I scores of three or more at day 42 mean that the trial has been unsuccessful and the patient should be switched.

Clinicians should monitor for drug side effects as per their usual practice. Any pathway drug may be stopped at any time if it cannot be tolerated, moving to the next appropriate drug. The algorithm specifies that a third antipsychotic may be tried with whichever of aripiprazole or quetiapine was not initially selected in Step 2, if full trials of the first two antipsychotics could not be tolerated. The drugs outlined earlier as being included for PRN use, trazodone, and in certain circumstances, lorazepam, may be administered alongside the main pathway drugs where appropriate, using the same doses and regimens described for the clean-up phase.

Exiting the pathway

At exit, all assessments undertaken at baseline, along with the CGI-I score (relative to baseline), should be repeated. The ECG and blood tests should also be repeated at or within five days of the time of exit.

### Elderly patients with dementia-related symptoms of severe agitation and aggression: consensus statement on treatment options, clinical trials methodology, and policy [^1162NVBF]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

Atypical antipsychotic drugs have been used off label in clinical practice for treatment of serious dementia-associated agitation and aggression. Following reports of cerebrovascular adverse events associated with the use of atypical antipsychotics in elderly patients with dementia, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued black box warnings for several atypical antipsychotics titled "Cerebrovascular Adverse Events, Including Stroke, in Elderly Patients With Dementia". Subsequently, the FDA initiated a metaanalysis of safety data from 17 registration trials across 6 antipsychotic drugs (5 atypical antipsychotics and haloperidol). In 2005, the FDA issued a black box warning regarding increased risk of mortality associated with the use of atypical antipsychotic drugs in this patient population.

Participants

Geriatric mental health experts participating in a 2006 consensus conference (Bethesda, Md. June 28–29) reviewed evidence on the safety and efficacy of antipsychotics, as well as nonpharmacologic approaches, in treating dementia-related symptoms of agitation and aggression. EVIDENCE/CONSENSUS PROCESS: The participants concluded that, while problems in clinical trial designs may have been one of the contributors to the failure to find a signal of drug efficacy, the findings related to drug safety should be taken seriously by clinicians in assessing the potential risks and benefits of treatment in a frail population, and in advising families about treatment. Information provided to patients and family members should be documented in the patient's chart. Drugs should be used only when nonpharmacologic approaches have failed to adequately control behavioral disruption. Participants also agreed that there is a need for an FDA-approved medication for the treatment of severe, persistent, or recurrent dementia-related symptoms of agitation and aggression (even in the absence of psychosis) that are unresponsive to nonpharmacologic intervention.

Conclusions

This article outlines methodological enhancements to better evaluate treatment approaches in future registration trials and provides an algorithm for improving the treatment of these patients in nursing home and non-nursing home settings.

Step 2(b): aripiprazole

Again, aripiprazole (NbN: dopamine, serotonin receptor partial agonist) has a smaller evidence base than risperidone. However, there is randomized trial evidence suggesting a statistically significant effect for agitation in patients with Alzheimer's disease where BPSD symptoms included psychosis, with superiority over placebo detected as early as week 2 for some outcomes. Aripiprazole was superior to placebo in a meta-analysis, both on outcome measures specific to agitation and on the more wide-ranging Neuropsychiatric Inventory. Aripiprazole was included as an alternative to quetiapine due to its differing mechanism of action, which involves partial D2 receptor antagonism. Although this has not been demonstrated, the panel of psychiatrists believed this different mechanism of action might confer a greater efficacy in risperidone non-responders than the remaining atypical antipsychotics.

Step 3: carbamazepine

Carbamazepine (NbN: glutamate: voltage-gated sodium and calcium channel blocker) is used in many forms of epilepsy and as a mood stabilizer for bipolar disorder. Case reports support its use to control aggressive outbursts in episodic dyscontrol syndrome. The panel ranked carbamazepine below the antipsychotics. It has one successful but small randomized trial in patients with BPSD who were resistant to treatment with antipsychotics, with efficacy demonstrated over a six-week treatment period, but also several other negative trials in BPSD (for review see). Carbamazepine presents several issues to prescribers including potential for drug interactions given its known induction of the CYP 3A4 enzyme, which plays a role in the metabolism of numerous psychotropic drugs, and rare but potentially dangerous side effects including severe skin reactions, aplastic anemia and agranulocytosis. However, the panel considered carbamazepine as a drug that still had potential for efficacy in the psychopathology of BPSD within a short time-scale in patients resistant to or unable to take antipsychotics. By Step 3 patients may already have been hospitalized for six weeks or more, and in Ontario, patients admitted to an inpatient psychiatric unit may be forced to relinquish their place in long-term care homes after 60 days in hospital. Thus, the panel regarded it as essential that prescribers had the option around this deadline of using a drug with the potential to deliver a marked improvement within a few weeks, in at least a minority of cases. However, prescribers can skip steps in the algorithm, and when they consider carbamazepine unsuitable, they may move straight to Step 4, citalopram.

### Behavioral and psychological symptoms in patients with dementia as a target for pharmacotherapy with risperidone [^116oG1Gu]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the effect of risperidone on specific behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD).

Method

We conducted a post hoc exploratory analysis of an integrated database from 3 randomized, controlled trials of risperidone versus placebo in treating 1150 nursing home residents with BPSD. Changes in scores were measured for items on the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI) and Behavioral Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (BEHAVE-AD).

Results

On the CMAI, risperidone was significantly more effective in treating hitting (p = .000), hurt self or other (p = .005), cursing or verbal aggression (p = .000), repetitive sentences or questions (p = .001), scratching (p = .041), general restlessness (p = .001), grabbing onto people (p = .028), constant request for attention (p = .041), pacing and aimless wandering (p = .013), and performing repetitious mannerisms (p = .045). On the BEHAVE-AD, risperidone was significantly more effective in treating physical threats and/or violence (p = .000), verbal outbursts (p = .000), other anxieties (p = .01), agitation (p = .000), tearfulness (p = .03), and nonparanoid delusions (p = .02).

Conclusions

The items from the BEHAVE-AD and CMAI that were improved with risperidone included psychotic, agitated, and aggressive symptoms. These data suggest that risperidone is more effective than placebo in treating a variety of symptoms associated with dementia.

Recommendation

The authors conclude that there should be a weak recommendation for discontinuation in patients currently treated with antipsychotics. Discontinuation of antipsychotics may be considered in patients for whom there is no obvious indication and in patients in whom there is suspicion of side effects, such as rapid cognitive decline, sedation, falls, or extrapyramidal symptoms.

Justification for recommendations

The identified studies did not show a significant positive or detrimental effect of discontinuation of antipsychotics. Observational studies have clearly demonstrated that treatment is associated with increased mortality in patients with dementia [53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59].

Supplemental considerations for treatment of agitation/aggression with antipsychotics in dementia

We believe that treatment with antipsychotics may be relevant in selected patients with agitation and/or aggression. With the recommendations in this guideline, we wish to indicate that in those patients where antipsychotics are indicated, atypical antipsychotics will often be the first‐line treatment. Most medical specialties may get involved in the decision to start or stop antipsychotic treatment. A detailed neuropsychiatric assessment including medical and drug history must be performed before initiating antipsychotic treatment.

In particular factors such as infection, dehydration, pain, pulmonary or cardiac disease, environmental factors such as changes in living conditions, and other stressors should be identified and treated adequately by non‐pharmacological approaches. We believe that a principle of watchful waiting should be adopted before initiating treatment with antipsychotics. Anti‐dementia medication (cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine) should be instituted as indicated. Communication and interaction with professional and family caregivers should be optimized. It is the opinion of the authors that antipsychotic treatment may be necessary in patients with severe agitation and/or aggression causing harm to themselves or to other people. Shared decision‐making must be emphasized, and the patient as well as a legal guardian in instances where one has been appointed must be informed about the individual risk–benefit ratio. In instances where treatment with antipsychotics is initiated, starting low with slow uptitration to the minimally effective dose or until unacceptable side effects occur is, in the opinion of the authors, paramount. Follow‐up for all patients should be planned and a preplanned stop date should be considered since symptoms may remit spontaneously. Long‐term treatment (more than 3 months) may be necessary in a minority of patients and must be monitored carefully (e.g. effects on symptoms, body weight, cognition, extrapyramidal symptoms, sedation and ECG).

4.4 Future research and implications

This study adds to existing evidence supporting the effectiveness of risperidone in managing psychosis, aggression, and possibly anxiety in people with dementia. Nonetheless, developing a data‐driven prediction model to identify patients most likely to benefit or experience harm could substantially improve clinical decision making, support personalized BPSD management, and ultimately enhance patient outcomes. Previous research has demonstrated that well‐designed prediction models of antipsychotic use in people with schizophrenia can assist clinicians in personalizing treatment, optimizing therapeutic effectiveness, and reducing the likelihood of adverse effects. In addition, subgroups that may influence treatment response — possibly due to risperidone's pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics — were identified, and these hypotheses should be tested to enable clinically meaningful interpretation. Finally, early response at week 2 was strongly associated with achieving response at weeks 4 and 8, suggesting that early treatment evaluation could help guide more informed clinical decisions.

Dementia-related aggression and psychosis — risperidone and haloperidol randomized trials — show that response rates were 47%, 63%, and 54% for placebo, haloperidol (mean dosage 1.2 mg/day), and risperidone (mean dosage 1.1 mg/day), and these response rates did not differ statistically; secondary outcomes related to aggression decreased with both active treatments while cognitive and functional outcomes did not differ, and in a separate trial of flexibly dosed risperidone in 337 nursing home patients with severe dementia requiring treatment for aggression there was a significant difference in response rates of 37% for placebo and 63% for risperidone (mean dosage 1 mg/day).

### American psychiatric association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. second edition [^111yPKvn]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Antipsychotics — Alzheimer's disease and other dementias are presented as the primary pharmacological treatment for psychotic symptoms and the most commonly used and best-studied pharmacological treatment for agitation, with considerable evidence from randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials and meta-analyses for efficacy. Findings from CATIE-AD failed to demonstrate conclusive benefits of second-generation antipsychotics over placebo in Alzheimer's disease with psychosis or aggression, although certain outcome variables favored medications and discontinuation due to lack of efficacy was lower with olanzapine and risperidone than with placebo or quetiapine. Given side effects and potential toxicity, the risks and benefits must be reassessed on an ongoing basis, the lowest effective dose should be sought with emergent side effects first treated by dose reduction, and indications should be generally limited to psychosis or behavioral disturbances, not primarily for sleep disorders or anxiety. Periodic attempts (e.g., every several months) to reduce or withdraw antipsychotic medications should be considered for all patients while weighing the probability of a relapse and the dangerousness of the target behavior(s). In general, agents with significant anticholinergic properties should be avoided in patients with dementia, and mild to moderate adverse effects of antipsychotics include akathisia, parkinsonism, and sedation.

Alzheimer's disease and other dementias — antipsychotic prescribing and dosing are outlined as follows: Accepted clinical practice is to use standing doses and oral administration is generally preferred, with intramuscular injection reserved for emergencies or when oral intake is not possible. Low starting doses are recommended (0.25–0.5 mg/day haloperidol; 0.25–1.0 mg/day risperidone; 12.5 mg/day clozapine; 1.25–5.0 mg/day olanzapine; 12.5–50 mg/day quetiapine); starting dosages for aripiprazole and ziprasidone are not known, though 5 mg/day of aripiprazole may be safe for most patients, and doses can be increased based on target-symptom response. Usual maximum dosages are 2 mg/day haloperidol, 1.5–2 mg/day risperidone, 75–100 mg/day clozapine, 200–300 mg/day quetiapine, 10 mg/day olanzapine, and 15 mg/day aripiprazole; risperidone causes fewer extrapyramidal symptoms at 1 mg/day than at higher doses. Clinicians should keep in mind that these medications take time to work and rapid dose escalation may produce side effects; although most patients do best below these maxima, some younger or very severely agitated patients may need higher doses, and antipsychotic agents must be used with extreme caution in dementia with Lewy bodies or Parkinson's disease.

### Advances in management of neuropsychiatric syndromes in neurodegenerative diseases [^112XHLSM]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

There is limited evidence to support the use of typical antipsychotics to manage aggression and agitation in clinically acute settings. Efficacy of the agents is modest. Haloperidol is useful in treatment of aggression with agitation (but not general agitation behaviors, such as wandering or verbal agitation). Typical antipsychotics are not recommended in non-emergent treatment of agitation in dementia. The use of typical antipsychotics in NDD even in acute situations has risk.

Atypical antipsychotics have a lower risk of certain side effect including parkinsonism, acute dystonic reactions, and tardive dyskinesia. Atypicals including risperidone, olanzapine, and aripiprazole are alternatives for use in management of severe agitation, aggression, and psychosis associated with AD where there is risk of harm to the patient and/or others. Risperidone has the best evidence for short-term efficacy (6–12 weeks) in patients with agitation. A meta-analysis of four large placebo-controlled clinical trials supported risperidone's efficacy in the management of agitation and aggression even in severely impaired AD patients. In AD patients with psychosis or agitation who had responded to risperidone therapy for 4–8 months, discontinuation of risperidone was associated with an increased risk of relapse. Risperidone may be considered as an option for short-term intervention in cases of acute, treatment-resistant agitation in AD and may be useful in long-term management of agitation where the agitation syndrome has become chronic.

### Multiple adverse outcomes associated with antipsychotic use in people with dementia: population based matched cohort study [^1122K7Wz]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Dementia is a clinical syndrome characterised by progressive cognitive decline and functional disability, with estimates suggesting that by 2050 around 152.8 million people globally will be affected. Behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia are common aspects of the disease and include features such as apathy, depression, aggression, anxiety, irritability, delirium, and psychosis. Such symptoms can negatively impact the quality of life of patients and their carers and are associated with early admission to care. Antipsychotics are commonly prescribed for the management of behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia, despite longstanding concerns about their safety. During the covid-19 pandemic, the proportion of people with dementia prescribed antipsychotics increased, possibly owing to worsened behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia linked to lockdown measures or reduced availability of non-pharmaceutical treatment options. According to guidelines from the UK's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, antipsychotics should only be prescribed for the treatment of behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia if non-drug interventions have been ineffective, if patients are at risk of harming themselves or others or are experiencing agitation, hallucinations, or delusions causing them severe distress. Antipsychotics should at most be prescribed at the lowest effective dose and for the shortest possible time. Only two antipsychotics, risperidone (an atypical, or second generation, antipsychotic) and haloperidol (a typical, or first generation, antipsychotic), are licensed in the UK for the treatment of behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia, although others have been commonly prescribed off-label.

### Quetiapine extended-release (quetiapine) [^113dXNPQ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).

Patients should be advised of the following issues and asked to alert their prescriber if these occur while taking

quetiapine extended-release tablets.

Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis

Patients and caregivers should be advised that elderly patients with dementia-related psychoses treated with atypical antipsychotic drugs are at increased risk of death compared with placebo. Quetiapine extended-release tablets are not approved for elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors

Patients, their families, and their caregivers should be encouraged to be alert to the emergence of anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, mania, other unusual changes in behavior, worsening of depression, and suicidal ideation, especially early during antidepressant treatment and when the dose is adjusted up or down. Families and caregivers of patients should be advised to look for the emergence of such symptoms on a day-to-day basis, since changes may be abrupt. Such symptoms should be reported to the patient's prescriber or health professional, especially if they are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms. Symptoms such as these may be associated with an increased risk for suicidal thinking and behavior and indicate a need for very close monitoring and possibly changes in the medication [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### Short-term antipsychotics for Alzheimer disease… [^117NbZY1]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical Question Do patients with Alzheimer disease who are treated with short-term antipsychotics have a higher mortality rate than those not taking antipsychotics. Evidence-Based Answer Physicians should consider not using antipsychotics in patients with dementia. Patients with dementia, including Alzheimer disease, who are treated with antipsychotics for any length of time have a higher mortality rate than those not taking antipsychotics. Of the 5, 110 patients, 1, 757 were randomized to placebo and 3, 353 were randomized to an atypical antipsychotic, including aripiprazole, 2 to 15 mg per day; risperidone, 0. 5 to 4 mg per day; quetiapine, 50 to 600 mg per day; and olanzapine, 1 to 15 mg per day. In pooled analysis of all 15 RCTs, death was more common among patients receiving atypical antipsychotics. Patients with Alzheimer disease were not analyzed separately from those with other causes of dementia. 2 Risk was assessed over multiple timeframes and for multiple antipsychotics. Patients had records in the Norwegian Prescription Database and were assumed to have dementia based on treatment with at least one antidementia drug. The anti-psychotic group had also received a prescription for risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, levomepromazine, perphenazine, prochlorperazine, haloperidol, zuclopenthi xol, or chlorprothixene, whereas the control group was receiving other psychotropic drugs, including antidepressants, benzodiazepines, lithium, and anticonvulsants.

### Efficacy and comparative effectiveness of atypical antipsychotic medications for off-label uses in adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116F3g2v]. JAMA (2011). Excellent credibility.

Context

Atypical antipsychotic medications are commonly used for off-label conditions such as agitation in dementia, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive disorder.

Objective

To perform a systematic review on the efficacy and safety of atypical antipsychotic medications for use in conditions lacking approval for labeling and marketing by the US Food and Drug Administration.

Data Sources and Study Selection

Relevant studies published in the English language were identified by searches of 6 databases (PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycInfo, Cochrane DARE, and CENTRAL) from inception through May 2011. Controlled trials comparing an atypical antipsychotic medication (risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, aripiprazole, ziprasidone, asenapine, iloperidone, or paliperidone) with placebo, another atypical antipsychotic medication, or other pharmacotherapy for adult off-label conditions were included. Observational studies with sample sizes of greater than 1000 patients were included to assess adverse events.

Data Extraction

Independent article review and study quality assessment by 2 investigators.

Data Synthesis

Of 12 228 citations identified, 162 contributed data to the efficacy review. Among 14 placebo-controlled trials of elderly patients with dementia reporting a total global outcome score that includes symptoms such as psychosis, mood alterations, and aggression, small but statistically significant effects sizes ranging from 0.12 and 0.20 were observed for aripiprazole, olanzapine, and risperidone. For generalized anxiety disorder, a pooled analysis of 3 trials showed that quetiapine was associated with a 26% greater likelihood of a favorable response (defined as at least 50% improvement on the Hamilton Anxiety Scale) compared with placebo. For obsessive-compulsive disorder, risperidone was associated with a 3.9-fold greater likelihood of a favorable response (defined as a 25% improvement on the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale) compared with placebo. In elderly patients, adverse events included an increased risk of death (number needed to harm [NNH] = 87), stroke (NNH = 53 for risperidone), extrapyramidal symptoms (NNH = 10 for olanzapine; NNH = 20 for risperidone), and urinary tract symptoms (NNH range = 16–36). In nonelderly adults, adverse events included weight gain (particularly with olanzapine), fatigue, sedation, akathisia (for aripiprazole), and extrapyramidal symptoms.

Conclusions

Benefits and harms vary among atypical antipsychotic medications for off-label use. For global behavioral symptom scores associated with dementia in elderly patients, small but statistically significant benefits were observed for aripiprazole, olanzapine, and risperidone. Quetiapine was associated with benefits in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder, and risperidone was associated with benefits in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder; however, adverse events were common.

Background for treatment of agitation/aggressive behavior with antipsychotics in dementia

Aggression or agitation may occur during the course of the condition without obvious reasons or when patients with dementia experience stress (e.g. changes in the environment during hospitalization), as a result of a physical condition, or as side effects of drug treatment. A number of meta‐analyses have found that the efficacy of antipsychotics for treating agitation/aggression in patients with dementia, is modest and confers increased mortality and risk of cerebrovascular accidents [50, 51, 52]. In 2007 European regulatory agencies and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued warnings regarding the use of atypical antipsychotics in patients with dementia. This was extended by the European Medicines Agency in 2008 and the FDA in 2009 to include a warning regarding the use of all antipsychotics, partly based on a number of large observational studies and meta‐analyses that showed an increased mortality associated with treatment [53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59], which has been confirmed in subsequent studies [2, 60].

However, antipsychotics may be used as first‐line pharmacological treatment in agitation/aggression under certain preconditions (after all non‐pharmacological measures have been proven to be without benefit or in the case of severe self‐harm or harm to others) [61]. This includes the use of risperidone, haloperidol and aripiprazole. Antipsychotics confer modest benefits for short‐term treatment of aggression/agitation in dementia [50, 51, 52], but these benefits have to be balanced against the risk of serious adverse events including increased mortality. The benefits are less clear‐cut with long‐term prescribing, but the mortality risk remains significantly elevated [53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59]. Therefore, minimizing and individualizing (with regular assessment of the individual risk–benefit ratio) the use of antipsychotics and ensuring that treatment with antipsychotics is only instituted when non‐pharmacological treatment proves to be ineffective and when treatable causes of agitation/aggression have been ruled out, is necessary and will improve quality of life and function. A prescription or dose optimization of cholinesterase inhibitors or memantine should be carried out in parallel to other measures, since the effects of this may only be evident with a delay of 8 to 12 weeks. Because of the risk of severe hypersensitivity to antipsychotics in patients with Lewy‐body dementia and Parkinson´s disease dementia, the recommendations for Research questions 4.1 and 4.2 do not extend to these patients.

### Effectiveness of atypical antipsychotic drugs in patients with Alzheimer's disease [^114PoC9D]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2006). Excellent credibility.

Background

Second-generation (atypical) antipsychotic drugs are widely used to treat psychosis, aggression, and agitation in patients with Alzheimer's disease, but their benefits are uncertain and concerns about safety have emerged. We assessed the effectiveness of atypical antipsychotic drugs in outpatients with Alzheimer's disease.

Methods

In this 42-site, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 421 outpatients with Alzheimer's disease and psychosis, aggression, or agitation were randomly assigned to receive olanzapine (mean dose, 5.5 mg per day), quetiapine (mean dose, 56.5 mg per day), risperidone (mean dose, 1.0 mg per day), or placebo. Doses were adjusted as needed, and patients were followed for up to 36 weeks. The main outcomes were the time from initial treatment to the discontinuation of treatment for any reason and the number of patients with at least minimal improvement on the Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC) scale at 12 weeks.

Results

There were no significant differences among treatments with regard to the time to the discontinuation of treatment for any reason: olanzapine (median, 8.1 weeks), quetiapine (median, 5.3 weeks), risperidone (median, 7.4 weeks), and placebo (median, 8.0 weeks) (P = 0.52). The median time to the discontinuation of treatment due to a lack of efficacy favored olanzapine (22.1 weeks) and risperidone (26.7 weeks) as compared with quetiapine (9.1 weeks) and placebo (9.0 weeks) (P = 0.002). The time to the discontinuation of treatment due to adverse events or intolerability favored placebo. Overall, 24% of patients who received olanzapine, 16% of patients who received quetiapine, 18% of patients who received risperidone, and 5% of patients who received placebo discontinued their assigned treatment owing to intolerability (P = 0.009). No significant differences were noted among the groups with regard to improvement on the CGIC scale. Improvement was observed in 32% of patients assigned to olanzapine, 26% of patients assigned to quetiapine, 29% of patients assigned to risperidone, and 21% of patients assigned to placebo (P = 0.22).

Conclusions

Adverse effects offset advantages in the efficacy of atypical antipsychotic drugs for the treatment of psychosis, aggression, or agitation in patients with Alzheimer's disease. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00015548 [ClinicalTrials.gov].).

### Efficacy of atypical antipsychotics in elderly patients with dementia [^114WpPZr]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Pharmacotherapy in patients with dementia aims to improve distressing behavioral and psychological signs of dementia after nonpharmacologic interventions fail, without causing unacceptable side effects or exacerbating underlying cognitive impairment. We review data describing risperidone (3 published placebo-controlled trials), olanzapine (1 abstract regarding a placebo-controlled trial and a published placebo-controlled trial), quetiapine (1 published open-label trial and an abstract regarding a placebo-controlled trial), and aripiprazole (1 abstract regarding a placebo-controlled trial). For example, a 12-week study of risperidone in patients with Alzheimer's disease showed a dose-related improvement in psychosis and agitation. The frequency of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) was also significantly greater in patients receiving the highest doses. A 6-week study of olanzapine showed greater improvement than placebo in agitation/aggression and psychosis with doses of 5 and 10 mg/day, but not 15 mg/day, with side effects including gait disturbance and sedation at all doses. A 52-week, open-label trial of quetiapine (median dose = 138 mg/day) in elderly patients with psychosis suggested good tolerability with apparent behavioral benefit; EPS improved or remained unchanged in most patients. Limited data describing aripiprazole have shown inconclusive evidence regarding relief of psychosis in elderly patients with Alzheimer's disease-related dementia, with apparently good tolerability over the short term. It appears that, in the aggregate, atypical antipsychotics are efficacious for treatment of agitation in dementia, with less clear impact on psychosis, but their tolerability profiles clearly differ. The National Institute of Mental Health-funded Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness in Alzheimer's Disease project will provide the first head-to-head comparisons of atypicals in dementia and will examine possible drug-drug differences between efficacy and effectiveness.

### A European Academy of Neurology guideline on medical management issues in dementia [^114Ut7B6]. European Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Justification for recommendations

It is the opinion of the authors that treatment of agitation and aggression (in the absence of severe self‐harm or harm to others) should principally be directed at underlying causes, which in many instances are identifiable and to some extent treatable or manageable. Further, the effect of antipsychotics will (in the absence of psychotic symptoms) in many instances rely on a sedating effect, which in general is unwanted. Finally, use of antipsychotics in elderly and patients with dementia is associated with an increased risk of severe morbidity and mortality [2, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60]. We believe that in light of this, and the fact that the included studies did not demonstrate an effect of treatment, a majority of patients will prefer no pharmacological treatment.

### Psychosis as a treatment target in dementia: a roadmap for designing interventions [^112yrMfY]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENT

The need for pharmacological interventions to treat all psychotic symptoms in dementia is a matter of debate. Currently, antipsychotic medications in patients with dementia are recommended only in cases in which there is substantial risk for harm to self or others, and after all non- pharmacological measures have failed. This approach is apparently justifiable in the case of minor hallucinations in PDD or DLB, to which patients are usually insightful, and which rarely lead to patient suffering or to behavioral changes. Nevertheless, early treatment of minor psychotic symptoms in PD has been suggested by some authors to attenuate psychiatric deterioration.

Despite the modest effect of pharmacological interventions and the increased risk for side effects, morbidity, and mortality, in practice, psychoactive medications are commonly used for the treatment of patients with dementia and psychosis, especially if clinical presentations are accompanied by additional behavioral disturbances such as agitation or aggression. For example, between 37.5–60% of patients with dementia in residential care facilities are usually prescribed antipsychotic medications, not only for genuine psychotic symptoms but also to control agitation, aggression, or severe sleep disturbances. Most notable is the use of typical (haloperidol, thioridazine) or atypical (risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, aripiprazole, clozapine, ziprasidone) antipsychotics with the latter being the preferred pharmacological treatment option.

### Quetiapine extended-release (quetiapine) [^1144tJQD]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms that might be precursors to worsening depression or suicidality, especially if these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms.

F a m i l i es and caregivers of patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder or other indications, both psychiatric and non-psychiatric, should be alerted about the need to monitor patients for the emergence of agitation, irritability, unusual changes in behavior, and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of suicidality, and to report such symptoms immediately to healthcare providers. Such monitoring should include daily observation by families and caregivers. Prescriptions for quetiapine extended-release tablets should be written for the smallest quantity of tablets consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose.

Screening Patients for Bipolar Disorder: A major depressive episode may be the initial presentation of bipolar disorder. It is generally believed (though not established in controlled trials) that treating such an episode with an antidepressant alone may increase the likelihood of precipitation of a mixed/manic episode in patients at risk for bipolar disorder. Whether any of the symptoms described above represent such a conversion is unknown. However, prior to initiating treatment with an antidepressant, including quetiapine extended-release, patients with depressive symptoms should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder; such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and depression.

5.3 Cerebrovascular Adverse Reactions,
Including Stroke, in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis

In placebo-controlled trials with risperidone, aripiprazole, and olanzapine in elderly subjects with dementia, there was a higher incidence of cerebrovascular adverse reactions (cerebrovascular accidents and transient ischemic attacks), including fatalities, compared to placebo-treated subjects. Quetiapine extended-release is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

### Present algorithms and future treatments for Alzheimer's disease [^114seEbf]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2019). Medium credibility.

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THERAPIES FOR NEUROPSYCHIATRIC SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

Treatments for neuropsychiatric features are an integral part of AD management. Estimates are that over time, > 90% of patients with AD will develop behavioral/psychiatric changes. Although no agent is currently approved to treat these symptoms in the United States, antidepressants and antipsychotics are commonly used off label in patients with AD. In general, the use of antidepressants (e.g. selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs]) for the treatment of depressive symptoms associated with dementia is recommended (Table 3), although the available evidence is mixed. Similarly, treatment with antipsychotics should be undertaken with caution and only used for moderate or severe agitation, aggression, and psychosis that create significant distress or danger. The use of antipsychotics in frail elders with dementia is associated with serious complications, including cerebrovascular AEs and mortality. The mortality rates vary among first-generation (typical) and second-generation (atypical) antipsychotics, and 6-month mortality rates of up to 20% have been reported in patients with dementia (haloperidol, 20%; olanzapine, 13%; risperidone, 13%; quetiapine, 9%). Thus, the potential benefits with antipsychotic treatment should be weighed against risks.

The SSRI citalopram has shown treatment benefits at doses of 30 mg/day or greater. In patients with probable AD, citalopram significantly reduced agitation compared with placebo. However, citalopram 30 mg/day was associated with QT interval prolongation, and patients older than 60 should not exceed a daily dose of 20 mg per FDA safety warning, which limits the use of citalopram among patients with AD. A recent study reported that citalopram (60 mg) reduced the amyloid- β concentration in cerebrospinal fluid in healthy adults and blocked the growth of amyloid plaques in an animal model, suggesting that it may have a disease-modifying role in AD. Additionally, evidence suggests, but does not prove, possible behavioral benefits of donepezil and memantine. Further studies are needed to confirm these research findings and address their potential clinical relevance.

### Sequential drug treatment algorithm for agitation and aggression in Alzheimer's and mixed dementia [^114X17bz]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2018). Low credibility.

Main pathway of sequential drug treatment (Figure 4 and Tables 3 and 4)

We acknowledge that some patients or their carers/decision makers may have issues with the use of antipsychotic drugs. These medications have the potential to provide rapid reduction not only agitation and aggression, but also psychosis, and they have the strongest evidence base for efficacy of all the drugs included in the pathway. However, they also carry risks of mortality and morbidity including stroke, falls and fractures, QTc prolongation, pneumonia and metabolic issues. Therefore, when antipsychotics are not permissible, the medication algorithm (Figure 4, Table 3) should be started at Step 3. Otherwise, physicians should start by considering Step 1 which is risperidone. If it is decided to skip Step 1 and not to use risperidone, one of the Step 2 drugs, quetiapine or aripiprazole, may be selected. Similarly subsequent drugs or steps may be skipped if a proposed drug is deemed inappropriate by the prescriber, for example when there is clear evidence of previous intolerance. Dosing schedules of recommended drugs are available in Tables 3 and 4. These schedules indicate the starting dose, time-points of dose increases, and "decision points" where the choice must be made of increasing the dose, exiting the pathway in the case of successful treatment, or switching to the next drug. For the first five drugs tabulated, a dosing schedule involving lower doses is available when the patient is deemed to be "frail". There is no operationalized definition of frailty, but it can be established based on (a) body mass index (BMI)/weight, (b) vital signs, (c) mobility, and (d) comorbid conditions and concurrent medications. For gabapentin and prazosin, dosing and the pace of dose increases should take account of further factors: renal function for gabapentin and both renal and hepatic function, along with the presence of antihypertensive agents, for prazosin. For this reason, specific "frail" dosing schedules are not provided for these final two drugs.

### Use of atypical antipsychotic drugs in patients with dementia [^114SEhkV]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Increasingly, atypical antipsychotic drugs are prescribed for elderly patients with symptoms of psychosis and behavioral disturbances. These symptoms often occur in patients with Alzheimer's disease, other dementias, or Parkinson's disease. As the average age of Americans increases, the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease will rise accordingly. Although nonpharmacologic treatments for behavioral disturbances should be tried first, medications often are needed to enable the patient to be adequately cared for. Current guidelines recommend using risperidone and olanzapine to treat psychosis in patients with Alzheimer's dementia. Quetiapine and clozapine are recommended for treatment of psychosis in patients with Parkinson's disease. Additional research is needed for a recently approved agent, ziprasidone. To minimize side effects, these medications should be started at low dosages that are increased incrementally. Drug interactions, especially those involving the cytochrome P450 system, must be considered. Clozapine's potentially lethal side effects limit its use in the primary care setting. Informed use of atypical antipsychotic drugs allows family physicians to greatly improve quality of life in elderly patients with dementia and behavior disturbances.

### Risk of death with atypical antipsychotic drug treatment for dementia: meta-analysis of randomized placebo-controlled trials [^115gZhha]. JAMA (2005). Excellent credibility.

Context

Atypical antipsychotic medications are widely used to treat delusions, aggression, and agitation in people with Alzheimer disease and other dementia; however, concerns have arisen about the increased risk for cerebrovascular adverse events, rapid cognitive decline, and mortality with their use.

Objective

To assess the evidence for increased mortality from atypical antipsychotic drug treatment for people with dementia.

Data Sources

MEDLINE (1966 to April 2005), the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (2005, Issue 1), meetings presentations (1997–2004), and information from the sponsors were searched using the terms for atypical antipsychotic drugs (aripiprazole, clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, and ziprasidone), dementia, Alzheimer disease, and clinical trial.

Study Selection

Published and unpublished randomized placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trials of atypical antipsychotic drugs marketed in the United States to treat patients with Alzheimer disease or dementia were selected by consensus of the authors.

Data Extraction

Trials, baseline characteristics, outcomes, all-cause dropouts, and deaths were extracted by one reviewer; treatment exposure was obtained or estimated. Data were checked by a second reviewer.

Data Synthesis

Fifteen trials (9 unpublished), generally 10 to 12 weeks in duration, including 16 contrasts of atypical antipsychotic drugs with placebo met criteria (aripiprazole [n = 3], olanzapine [n = 5], quetiapine [n = 3], risperidone [n = 5]). A total of 3353 patients were randomized to study drug and 1757 were randomized to placebo. Outcomes were assessed using standard methods (with random- or fixed-effects models) to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and risk differences based on patients randomized and relative risks based on total exposure to treatment. There were no differences in dropouts. Death occurred more often among patients randomized to drugs (118 [3.5%] vs 40 [2.3%]. The OR by meta-analysis was 1.54; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.06–2.23; p = 0.02; and risk difference was 0.01; 95% CI, 0.004–0.02; p = 0.01). Sensitivity analyses did not show evidence for differential risks for individual drugs, severity, sample selection, or diagnosis.

Conclusions

Atypical antipsychotic drugs may be associated with a small increased risk for death compared with placebo. This risk should be considered within the context of medical need for the drugs, efficacy evidence, medical comorbidity, and the efficacy and safety of alternatives. Individual patient analyses modeling survival and causes of death are needed.

### A randomized placebo-controlled trial of risperidone for the treatment of aggression, agitation, and psychosis of dementia [^112q9By7]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Background

This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial examined the efficacy and safety of risperidone in the treatment of aggression, agitation, and psychosis in elderly nursing-home patients with dementia.

Method

Elderly patients with a DSM-IV diagnosis of dementia of the Alzheimer's type, vascular dementia, or a combination of the 2 (i.e., mixed dementia) and significant aggressive behaviors were randomized to receive, for a period of 12 weeks, a flexible dose of either placebo or risperidone solution up to a maximum of 2 mg/day. Outcome measures were the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI), the Behavioral Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease (BEHAVE-AD) rating scale, and the Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S) and of Change (CGI-C) scales.

Results

A total of 345 patients were randomized to treatment with risperidone or placebo, and 337 patients received at least one dose of study drug. The trial was completed by 67% of patients in the placebo group and 73% of patients in the risperidone group. The mean ± SE dose of risperidone was 0.95 ± 0.03 mg/day. The primary endpoint of the study, the difference from baseline to endpoint in CMAI total aggression score, showed a significant reduction in aggressive behavior for risperidone versus placebo (p < .001). A similar improvement was also seen for the CMAI total non-aggression subscale (p < .002) and for the BEHAVE-AD total (p < .001) and psychotic symptoms subscale (p = .004). At endpoint, the CGI-S and the CGI-C scores indicated a significantly greater improvement with risperidone compared with placebo (p < .001). Overall, 94% and 92% of the risperidone and placebo groups, respectively, reported at least 1 adverse event. Somnolence and urinary tract infection were more common with risperidone treatment, whereas agitation was more common with placebo. There was no significant difference in the number of patients who reported extrapyramidal symptoms between the risperidone (23%) and placebo (16%) groups.

Conclusion

Treatment with low-dose (mean = 0.95 mg/day) risperidone resulted in significant improvement in aggression, agitation, and psychosis associated with dementia.

4 DISCUSSION

4.1 Summary of main findings

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply an IPD‐MA approach to evaluate treatment response, treatment modifiers, and predictors of risperidone in people with dementia. Our findings show that risperidone provided a modest benefit in achieving a therapeutic response at week 8. Symptom‐specific analyses revealed that individuals with baseline psychosis experienced a reduction in psychosis scores by week 8, while those with aggression and anxiety showed improvement at week 4. No significant benefit was observed for other BEHAVE‐AD components. We also identified several demographic and clinical factors that modified risperidone's effect on the BEHAVE‐AD total score and its subcomponents. Notably, achieving an early therapeutic response at week 2 was a strong predictor of continued response at both week 4 and week 8.

### Dementia-related agitation: a review of non-pharmacological interventions and analysis of risks and benefits of pharmacotherapy [^113HTVCU]. Translational Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Anecdote of clinical experience

Over the past three years, we have experience a surge in the number of dementia-related illnesses being admitted to our unit. Quite recently, we managed a clinical condition that apparently stimulates the urge for writing this review. The intention is to increase the awareness of fellow clinicians/physicians, and also, hoping the carers and family of dementia patients who read medical journals will be better informed.

An elderly frail woman, mostly bedbound, from a nursing home was admitted to our unit. She had background history of frontotemporal dementia and previous stroke. Her family mentioned that she often became agitated whenever she had exacerbations of arthritic pains or infections (particularly urinary infection). However, due to rising frequencies of agitation and aggression symptoms in the nursing home, she was reviewed by the community Psychiatry team and was started on quetiapine treatment. On subsequent review by the latter, risperidone was added to her medications due to lack of improvement of her symptoms. The addition of risperidone made her to be overly drowsy on most time of the day, and her oral intake became very poor according to her family.

Unfortunately, in just over six months on quetiapine and risperidone combination, she suffered another major ischemic stroke, and was started on end of life care in the same nursing home. At that time, all her active medications were stopped including the antipsychotics (risperidone and quetiapine). Surprisingly, she made a spontaneous recovery after few weeks, and her oral intake began to improve at the time. However, about two months following her recovery, she was restarted on her regular medications including the antipsychotics. Again, she started becoming drowsy again at most times of the day with worsening oral intake due to drowsiness. Little wonder, she presented to our unit with acute kidney injury from severe dehydration and also had aspiration pneumonia. During the week-long period of admission on our unit, her antipsychotics medications were stopped and she was rehydrated and treated for likely aspiration pneumonia. Her oral intake became significantly improved and she was neither agitated nor aggressive at any time during the period of her admission into our unit. On discharge, I discussed with the patient's next of kin the need to stop both the risperidone and quetiapine, as these medications were no longer indicated in the patient. I also put a note to the psychiatry team to inform them of the above plan and requested a follow-up by them.

It is well known that serotonergic function is related to aggression. Patients with Alzheimer's disease exhibit aggressive behavior, and alterations in their serotonergic function have been identified. Recent clinical trials involving new antipsychotic agents, such as risperidone, which has both serotonergic and dopaminergic activity, have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of these drugs in treating the psychosis and aggressive behavior associated with dementia.

### Physician antipsychotic overprescribing letters and cognitive, behavioral, and physical health outcomes among people with dementia: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^111xB72K]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Off-label use of antipsychotics in patients with dementia is commonplace. Approximately 1 in 7 nursing home residents receives an antipsychotic every quarter, and a similar share of people with dementia who live in the community receive an antipsychotic annually. Rates of antipsychotic use in older adults with dementia have declined but prescribing persists at high levels. Antipsychotics are frequently prescribed off-label to treat behavioral symptoms of dementia such as agitation and aggression. Although there is some evidence supporting this use, it can also cause substantial harm. Studies have linked antipsychotic use among people with dementia to increased risks of weight gain, cognitive decline, falls and other injuries, cerebrovascular events, and mortality.,

Specialty societies and regulators have, therefore, promoted more judicious use of antipsychotics in dementia care. However, studies on reducing prescribing largely consist of small trials or observational analyses, and evidence from large-scale randomized studies remains limited. In practice, efforts to further reduce antipsychotic prescribing might achieve modest benefit or could even harm patients. For instance, ongoing antipsychotic use may occur in settings that lack the staffing and other resources to provide effective alternative interventions to ensure patient safety.

We seek to fill this gap in empirical evidence through a secondary analysis of a large randomized letter trial that focused on the antipsychotic quetiapine. Quetiapine is the most-prescribed antipsychotic in the US and is frequently used among patients with dementia. The trial enrolled approximately the top 5% of primary care physician (PCP) prescribers of quetiapine in Medicare. A random half of these PCPs were sent a series of overprescribing warning letters about their prescribing of quetiapine. The primary evaluation of this trial found that the letters substantially reduced quetiapine prescribing for at least 2 years. However, that evaluation studied a considerably smaller patient sample and did not examine health outcomes beyond hospital visits. The current analysis uses linkages to claims and nursing home assessments to evaluate the effects of the letters on health outcomes among these PCPs' patients with dementia.

In this analysis, we followed patients with dementia over multiple years and evaluated effects on several behavioral, cognitive, metabolic, and other physical health outcomes. These end points align with the adverse effects of quetiapine and other antipsychotics like weight gain that might improve with deprescribing, as well as the potential benefits of these medications like reduced agitation that could deteriorate with indiscriminate deprescribing.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).

Patients should be advised of the following issues and asked to alert their prescriber if these occur while taking SEROQUEL XR.

Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis

Patients and caregivers should be advised that elderly patients with dementia-related psychoses treated with atypical antipsychotic drugs are at increased risk of death compared with placebo. SEROQUEL XR is not approved for elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors

Patients, their families, and their caregivers should be encouraged to be alert to the emergence of anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, mania, other unusual changes in behavior, worsening of depression, and suicidal ideation, especially early during antidepressant treatment and when the dose is adjusted up or down. Families and caregivers of patients should be advised to look for the emergence of such symptoms on a day-to-day basis, since changes may be abrupt. Such symptoms should be reported to the patient's prescriber or health professional, especially if they are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms. Symptoms such as these may be associated with an increased risk for suicidal thinking and behavior and indicate a need for very close monitoring and possibly changes in the medication [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### Agitation in dementia: real-world impact and burden on patients and the healthcare system [^112MtDzB]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

We observed the likelihood of receiving no treatment was lower in agitated than non-agitated patients and decreased with increasing agitation score, that more agitated than non-agitated patients were receiving treatment with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, memantine, antipsychotics, antidepressants, and benzodiazepines, and that the proportion of patients receiving an antipsychotic or antidepressant increased with increasing agitation score. There is limited evidence of efficacy and a risk of adverse effects for pharmacologic agents in the management of agitation symptoms in dementia; consequently, drug therapy should be considered only if symptoms are severely distressing for patients or caregivers. However, a Cochrane review reported the antidepressants sertraline and citalopram to be associated with a reduction in symptoms of agitation when compared to placebo; meanwhile, brexpiprazole, an atypical antipsychotic, has been shown to have the potential to improve agitation in AD compared with placebo. A sequential treatment algorithm with risperidone, aripiprazole or quetiapine, carbamazepine, citalopram, gabapentin, and prazosin has been proposed.

We observed increasing healthcare costs to be associated with increasing agitation. Cross-sectional data from a large patient cohort from eight European countries showed a significant difference in cost of care between dementia patients experiencing and not experiencing agitation, in both home care and institutional long-term care settings. A prospective cohort study of data from UK patients with AD showed health and social care costs to vary significantly between patients with and without agitation, with the authors calculating an excess cost associated with agitation of £2 billion/year for all AD patients in the UK. An analysis of a population-based sample of patients with dementia in the US also showed an increase in agitation/aggression led to increased costs of informal care.

Given the association of agitation with more severe/advanced dementia that we observed, and that has been reported in the literature, it might be speculated that underlying disease severity is driving the higher HCRU and healthcare cost that we noted in patients with agitation. However, as both disease severity (assessed by the MMSE) and time since diagnosis were covariates in the regression analyses, it would appear that the presence of agitation is an independent factor in the higher economic burden seen in the group of patients experiencing agitation symptoms.

American Geriatrics Society Choosing Wisely — behavioral symptoms in dementia — advises: "Don't use antipsychotics as first choice to treat behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia". Although often prescribed, "the medications provide limited benefits and can increase risks of serious harm, including stroke and premature death", and "Use of these drugs should be limited in this population". The recommendation is "based on evidence from randomized controlled trials and on expert opinion", including a "42-site, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial" in which "421 outpatients with Alzheimer's disease and psychosis, aggression, or agitation were randomly prescribed one of three atypical antipsychotic medications (olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone) or placebo".

Dementia-related psychosis and agitation — antipsychotic efficacy: First-generation antipsychotics have modest benefit over placebo across "seven double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, parallel-group clinical trials including 252 patients studied over periods of 3–8 weeks", with meta-analysis showing improvement in "59% of the subjects taking antipsychotics and 41% of those taking placebo"; studies used doses "ranging from 66 to 267 mg/day in chlorpromazine equivalents", adverse effects were "common", and "Dropout rates were also high". A more recent meta-analysis found clinically significant improvement in "64%… versus 38%… translating to an effect size of 26%", with "No differences in efficacy… among the different agents" and "Significant side effects… 25% more" with active treatment; another review reported "61% with antipsychotics and 35% with placebo, yielding a treatment effect of 26%". For second-generation antipsychotic risperidone, "Three placebo-controlled trials" are noted; in a fixed-dose study of "625 patients", response rates were "45% and 50% for 1 mg/day and 2 mg/day, respectively… than placebo (33%)… (the 0.5-mg/day dose was not more effective than placebo)", and "Parkinsonism was seen in 21% of patients who received 2 mg/day", concluding "the 1 mg/day represented the most effective dose".

### Risperidone for the treatment of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia [^115FVkCF]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Risperidone offers physicians the unique combination of extensive, published clinical experience and a good safety profile for treating patients with dementia who have symptoms of aggression, agitation, and psychosis. Numerous open-label and, more recently, placebo-controlled trials have documented the efficacy of risperidone in the management of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia. These trials also show that risperidone is better tolerated than conventional neuroleptic agents. Comparatively, patients treated with risperidone experience substantially fewer side effects, including extrapyramidal symptoms, cognitive toxicity, and tardive dyskinesia.

### Management of agitation and aggression associated with Alzheimer disease [^114hjdjA]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2009). Medium credibility.

Agitation and aggression are frequently occurring and distressing behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). These symptoms are disturbing for individuals with Alzheimer disease, commonly confer risk to the patient and others, and present a major management challenge for clinicians. The most widely prescribed pharmacological treatments for these symptoms-atypical antipsychotics-have a modest but significant beneficial effect in the short-term treatment (over 6–12 weeks) of aggression but limited benefits in longer term therapy. Benefits are less well established for other symptoms of agitation. In addition, concerns are growing over the potential for serious adverse outcomes with these treatments, including stroke and death. A detailed consideration of other pharmacological and nonpharmacological approaches to agitation and aggression in patients with Alzheimer disease is, therefore, imperative. This article reviews the increasing evidence in support of psychological interventions or alternative therapies (such as aromatherapy) as a first-line management strategy for agitation, as well as the potential pharmacological alternatives to atypical antipsychotics-preliminary evidence for memantine, carbamazepine, and citalopram is encouraging.

Summary of evidence

Four references reporting on the effect of atypical antipsychotics versus haloperidol were identified (Figure S4 and Tables S13 and S17). Three studies were RCTs [69, 70, 71] and one was an RCT with a crossover design [72]. Three studies compared risperidone (0.25 to 2 mg) to haloperidol (0.25 to 3 mg), and one study compared it with olanzapine (2.5 to 7.5 mg). There were no events in the studies reporting on mortality [69, 70, 72] or serious adverse events [71, 72]. With regard to agitation/aggression, two studies on risperidone reported that treatment with atypical antipsychotics improved scores [71, 72], and two studies, one on risperidone, the other on olanzapine, reported the converse [69, 70]. However, none of the studies reported measures of variance (Tables S18 and S19). None of the studies reported on caregiver burden. One study did not include a financial statement [69], and two studies reported receiving funding for the study from pharmaceutical companies [71, 72]. None of the studies included a conflicts of interest statement.

Level of evidence

The level of evidence was graded as very low (Tables S18 and S19).

Recommendation

The authors conclude that there should be a weak recommendation for treatment of patients with dementia and agitation/aggressive behavior with modern (atypical) antipsychotics compared to haloperidol when pharmacological treatment of agitation/aggressive behavior is necessary. Among modern (atypical) antipsychotics, risperidone may be considered as first‐line treatment when pharmacological treatment of agitation/aggressive behavior is necessary.

Justification for recommendations

Atypical antipsychotics is superior compared to placebo in reducing behavioral symptoms in patients with dementia, whereas haloperidol is not [73] and in elderly patients with various conditions, risperidone has been found to be as efficacious as haloperidol [74]. Moreover, several very large observational studies have demonstrated that haloperidol is associated with higher mortality, risk of pneumonia and cardiovascular disease compared to atypical antipsychotics (including risperidone) [53, 54].

### Psychosis as a treatment target in dementia: a roadmap for designing interventions [^112wqr6w]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

Most of the current evidence for the use of atypical antipsychotics shows a heterogeneity based on numerous factors such as: study population (institutionalized versus non-institutionalized or mixed patient populations); type of dementia (any dementia; probable AD; dementia with parkinsonism); or type of behavioral abnormality (psychosis versus psychosis and/or other behavioral abnormalities — agitation or aggression, or merely behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia such as agitation). These differences are also reflected in the primary outcome measures used to quantify improvement in most of the studies.

In some studies, the improvement in behavioral outcomes observed at follow-up was attributed to the beneficial effect of antipsychotic medications over placebo. However, in others, a significant improvement was observed in both groups with no differences between the active treatment and the placebo groups. These results may suggest that treatment of behavioral symptoms in dementia may be prone to a significant placebo effect, thus potentially resulting from non-specific benefits such as the enrollment in a clinical trial, the natural course of illness, and symptomatic decline over time. A significant placebo effect has been recognized in patients with antidepressants and agitation who have been randomized to citalopram or placebo. The most significant improvement was recorded in patients who were most symptomatic at baseline, suggesting that a placebo effect may also result from regression towards the mean.

Other types of medications prescribed for patients with dementia-related severe behavioral disturbances include antidepressants, anticonvulsants, and cholinesterase inhibitors, though clinical trials examining their efficacy and safety specifically on psychosis are scarce. Citalopram for example, may have a beneficial impact on agitation with or without psychosis; however, it is still not clear whether this treatment is advantageous over other atypical antipsychotics such as risperidone. However, antidepressants may be used as first-line treatment to decrease the use of antipsychotic medication. The use of anticonvulsants for this indication is even more controversial in light of their low tolerability and inconclusive evidence on their efficacy. The primary outcomes of clinical trials examining the efficacy of cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine were mostly targeted to evaluate a sum of behavioral symptoms rather than psychosis per se. In most of these studies, these medications did not show a substantial beneficial effect on behavior.

### Sequential drug treatment algorithm for agitation and aggression in Alzheimer's and mixed dementia [^116iVCCS]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2018). Low credibility.

Step 1: risperidone

Risperidone (neuroscience based nomenclature (NbN): dopamine, serotonin, noradrenaline receptor antagonist) has the strongest evidence base for treatment of BPSD symptoms in Alzheimer's or mixed dementia through several large randomized trials. In Canada, risperidone has approval for symptomatic management of aggression or psychosis restricted to severe dementia of the Alzheimer's type while in the UK it is licensed for short-term treatment of aggression in BPSD (up to six weeks). In the USA, the use of risperidone is not approved for any BPSD-related indication.

As all antipsychotics, risperidone carries cardiovascular and metabolic risks. A relationship between antipsychotics and stroke has been suggested. In a large retrospective case-control study of patients with dementia, antipsychotics conferred an excess risk of mortality from all causes over 180 days, compared with matched controls on no psychotropic drug treatment with a number needed to harm (NNH) of 27 for risperidone (95% confidence interval: 19–46). Olanzapine and quetiapine had slightly, but not significantly, higher NNHs but the risk of mortality for all three atypical antipsychotics studied had a significant relationship to dose. Thus, the algorithm allows for the scenario that a patient or their caregivers may be unwilling to agree to the use of atypical antipsychotics, whereby the medication algorithm may be started at Step 3.

Step 2(a): quetiapine

The evidence base for quetiapine (NbN: dopamine and serotonin receptor antagonist and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor) is considerably weaker than that for risperidone. However, a meta-analysis combining five randomized trials reported a statistically significant effect relative to placebo on neuropsychiatric symptoms (Neuropsychiatric Inventory scores) and overall improvement (Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scores). While these effects were modest, quetiapine ranked well for time to onset of effect with CGI change score reported to be significantly greater than placebo after one week, tolerability, and its evidence of efficacy in other disorders such as Generalized Anxiety Disorder (for review see). Quetiapine was therefore included alongside aripiprazole as an option for the algorithm's second step.

### Assessment of reported comparative effectiveness and safety of atypical antipsychotics in the treatment of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia: a network meta-analysis [^114X7ejC]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Which atypical antipsychotic is most beneficial and safe for the treatment of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia?

Findings

In this network meta-analysis of 17 studies (5373 patients), no significant differences were found across measures of effectiveness and safety among aripiprazole, olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone, although differences were found for some of these drugs and outcomes compared with placebo. No trials were found for other atypical antipsychotics.

Meaning

Insufficient evidence exists on which atypical antipsychotic is both safest and most beneficial across several measures for people with dementia, and this study suggests that a single most effective and safe treatment option may not exist.

Should patients with dementia and agitation/aggressive behavior be treated with modern (atypical) antipsychotics compared to no pharmacological treatment?

PICO question

Population: Patients with dementia and agitation/aggressive behavior.

Intervention: Treatment with aripiprazole, zotepine, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone or clozapine.

Comparator: No pharmacological treatment.

Outcome: 1. Mortality (Important); 2. Agitation/Aggression (Critical); 3. Global cognitive function (Important); 4. Serious adverse events (Critical); 5. Caregiver burden (Important).

Summary of evidence

A total of 4058 references were screened and seven references were included [62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68] (Figure S4 and Table S13 and S14). Two references reported on different outcomes from the same study [65, 66]. All studies included were RCTs. Studies were on risperidone (0.25 to 2 mg), quetiapine (25 to 200 mg) or olanzapine (2.5 to 15 mg). Meta‐analysis was not performed due to heterogeneity in populations, length of interventions and outcome measures. There were no differences in mortality between interventions and across studies [62, 64, 65, 67, 68] (relative risk point estimates 0.85–2.08; not significant) or serious adverse events [62, 63, 66, 67] (relative risk point estimates 0.89–1.9; not significant in all but one study [68]). However, there were, in general, very few events for the two outcomes, possibly because of the relatively low number of patients and short length of included trials (6–36 weeks; four studies ≤ 12 weeks). For both global cognitive function and agitation/aggression scores, there was no difference in change score between treatment and placebo, except for a single study [67]. None of the studies reported on caregiver burden (Table S15). All studies reported financial statements. All but one study [67] reported receiving some or all of the funding for the study from pharmaceutical companies. One study did not include a statement on conflict of interest [62] (Table S1).

Level of evidence

The level of evidence was graded as low (Tables S15 and S16).

### American psychiatric association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. second edition [^112TqgWk]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Alzheimer's disease and other dementias — selection among second-generation antipsychotics is typically based on side effects rather than efficacy differences: There are few relative efficacy data; the CATIE-AD trial did not find significant differences in efficacy or tolerability among olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone, although time to discontinuation due to lack of efficacy was longer for olanzapine and risperidone than for quetiapine. The choice is most often guided by side effect profiles, with second-generation agents usually selected first, and practice is to match an agent's common side effects to patient vulnerabilities (e.g., avoid clozapine for anticholinergic sensitivity or choose agents with fewer motor side effects — aripiprazole, clozapine, or quetiapine — for Parkinson's disease or dementia with Lewy bodies).

### The effectiveness of atypical antipsychotics for the treatment of aggression and psychosis in Alzheimer's disease [^1111xXVD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Aggression, agitation or psychosis occur in the majority of people with dementia at some point in the illness. There have been a number of trials of atypical antipsychotics to treat these symptoms over the last five years, and a systematic review is needed to evaluate the evidence in a balanced way.

Objectives

To determine whether evidence supports the use of atypical antipsychotics for the treatment of aggression, agitation and psychosis in people with Alzheimer's disease.

Search Strategy

The trials were identified from a last updated search of the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group on 7 December 2004 using the terms olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, clozapine, amisulpride, sertindole, zotepine, aripiprazole, ziprasidone. This Register contains articles from all major healthcare databases and many ongoing trials databases and is updated regularly.

Selection Criteria

Randomised, placebo-controlled trials, with concealed allocation, where dementia and psychosis and/or aggression were assessed.

Data Collection and Analysis

1. Two reviewers extracted data from included trials2. Data were pooled where possible, and analysed using appropriate statistical methods3. Analysis included patients treated with an atypical antipsychotic, compared with placebo

Main Results

Sixteen placebo controlled trials have been completed with atypical antipsychotics although only nine had sufficient data to contribute to a meta-analysis and only five have been published in full in peer reviewed journals. No trials of amisulpiride, sertindole or zotepine were identified which met the criteria for inclusion. The included trials led to the following results:1. There was a significant improvement in aggression with risperidone and olanzapine treatment compared to placebo.2. There was a significant improvement in psychosis amongst risperidone treated patients.3. Risperidone and olanzpaine treated patients had a significantly higher incidence of serious adverse cerebrovascular events (including stroke), extra-pyramidal side effects and other important adverse outcomes.4. There was a significant increase in drop-outs in risperidone (2 mg) and olanzapine (5–10 mg) treated patients.5. The data were insufficient to examine impact upon cognitive function.

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence suggests that risperidone and olanzapine are useful in reducing aggression and risperidone reduces psychosis, but both are associated with serious adverse cerebrovascular events and extra-pyramidal symptoms. Despite the modest efficacy, the significant increase in adverse events confirms that neither risperidone nor olanzapine should be used routinely to treat dementia patients with aggression or psychosis unless there is marked risk or severe distress. Although insufficient data were available from the considered trials, a meta-analysis of seventeen placebo controlled trials of atypical neuroleptics for the treatment of behavioural symptoms in people with dementia conducted by the Food and Drug Administration (using data not in the public domain) suggested a significant increase in mortality (OR 1.7).

Results

Drugs and physical treatments included in the main sequential treatment algorithm – evidence and rationale

Following review of patient's suitability for the algorithm, baseline assessments, and a "clean-up" or "washout" period (Figure 3), the algorithm begins with trials of antipsychotic drugs (Figure 4).systematically appraised existing guidelines for BPSD. They noted that there was a broad agreement among 15 clinical guidelines that antipsychotic drugs had the strongest evidence for treating BPSD. However, the efficacy of antipsychotic drugs comes at a cost for some individuals, as they carry risks of falls, excessive sedation, and metabolic abnormalities. A further concern is the reported increased risk of stroke and mortality associated with atypical antipsychotics. In general, guidelines recommend restricting the use of antipsychotic medications to where symptoms and their potential consequences meet specific criteria. For example, recent guidance from the American Psychiatric Association states "… nonemergency antipsychotic medication should only be used for the treatment of agitation or psychosis in patients with dementia when symptoms are severe, are dangerous, and/or cause significant distress to the patient" (: 24). However, in the hospital inpatient setting for which the algorithm was designed, many patients with dementia exhibiting agitation and aggression do indeed meet these criteria, for example being at significant risk of harming themselves or others and exhibiting clear evidence of distress. Where symptoms of agitation and aggression do not meet these criteria, this drug treatment algorithm should not be used.

While the recommended treatment sequence begins with antipsychotic agents, we have acknowledged that a minority of patients or their families and caregivers may not agree with the use of antipsychotic drugs, in which case drug treatment may need to start lower down the algorithm at Step 3. While several antipsychotic drugs have trial or meta-analytic evidence of efficacy for agitation and aggression associated with Alzheimer's disease, we selected three atypical antipsychotic drugs: risperidone, quetiapine, and aripiprazole.

### Using antipsychotic agents in older patients [^11649cwj]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

Antipsychotics are widely used in geriatric psychiatric disorders. A growing number of atypical antipsychotics are available, expanding clinical options but complicating decision-making. Many questions about use of antipsychotics in older patients remain unanswered by available clinical literature. We therefore surveyed expert opinion on antipsychotic use in older patients (65 years of age or older) for recommendations concerning indications for antipsychotics, choice of antipsychotics for different conditions (e.g., delirium, dementia, schizophrenia, delusional disorder, psychotic mood disorders) and for patients with comorbid conditions or history of side effects, dosing strategies, duration of treatment, and medication combinations.

Method

Based on a literature review, a 47-question survey with 1,411 options was developed. Approximately three quarters of the options were scored using a modified version of the RAND 9-point scale for rating appropriateness of medical decisions. For other options, experts were asked to write in answers. The survey was sent to 52 American experts on treatment of older adults (38 geriatric psychiatrists, 14 geriatric internists/family physicians), 48 (92%) of whom completed it. In analyzing responses to items rated on the 9-point scale, consensus was defined as a nonrandom distribution of scores by chi-square "goodness-of-fit" test. We assigned a categorical rank (first line/preferred, second line/alternate, third line/usually inappropriate) to each option based on the 95% confidence interval around the mean. Guidelines indicating preferred treatment strategies were then developed for key clinical situations.

Results

The expert panel reached consensus on 78% of options rated on the 9-point scale. The experts did not recommend using antipsychotics in panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, nonpsychotic major depression, hypochondriasis, neuropathic pain, severe nausea, motion sickness, or irritability, hostility, and sleep disturbance in the absence of a major psychiatric syndrome. However, antipsychotics were favored in several other disorders. For agitated dementia with delusions, the experts' first-line recommendation is an antipsychotic drug alone; they would also consider adding a mood stabilizer. Risperidone (0.5–2.0 mg/day) was first line followed by quetiapine (50–150 mg/day) and olanzapine (5.0–7.5 mg/day) as high second-line options. There was no first-line recommendation for agitated dementia without delusions; an antipsychotic alone was high second line (rated first line by 60% of the experts). The experts'first-line recommendation for late-life schizophrenia was risperidone (1.25–3.5 mg/day). Quetiapine (100–300 mg/day), olanzapine (7.5–15 mg/day), and aripiprazole (15–30 mg/day) were high second line. For older patients with delusional disorder, an antipsychotic was the only treatment recommended. For agitated nonpsychotic major depression in an older patient, the experts' first-line recommendation was an antidepressant alone (77% first line); second-line options were an antidepressant plus an antipsychotic, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), an antidepressant plus a benzodiazepine, and an antidepressant plus a mood stabilizer. For nonpsychotic major depression with severe anxiety, the experts recommended an antidepressant alone (79% first line) and would also consider adding a benzodiazepine or mood stabilizer to the antidepressant. If an older patient with adequate dosages for adequate duration, there was limited support for adding an atypical antipsychotic to the antidepressant (36% first line after two failed antidepressant trials). Treatment of choice for geriatric psychotic major depression was an antipsychotic plus an antidepressant (98% first line), with ECT another first-line option (71% first line). For mild geriatric nonpsychotic mania, the first-line recommendation is a mood stabilizer alone; the experts would also consider discontinuing an antidepressant if the patient is receiving one. For severe nonpsychotic mania, the experts recommend a mood stabilizer alone; the experts would also consider discontinuing an antidepressant if the patient is receiving one. For severe nonpsychotic mania, the experts recommend a mood stabilizer plus an antipsychotic (57%; first line) or a mood stabilizer alone (48%; first line) and would discontinue any antidepressant the patient is receiving. For psychotic mania, treatment of choice is a mood stabilizer plus an antipsychotic (98%; first line). Risperidone (1.25–3.0 mg/day) and olanzapine (5–15 mg/day) were first-line options in combination with a mood stabilizer for mania with psychosis, with quetiapine (50–250 mg/day) high second line. If a patient has responded well, the experts recommended the following duration of treatment before attempting to taper and discontinue the antipsychotic: delirium, 1 week; agitated dementia, taper within 3–6 months to determine the lowest effective maintenance dose; schizophrenia, indefinite treatment at the lowest effective dose; delusional disorder, 6 months-indefinitely at the lowest effective dose; psychotic major depression, 6 months; and mania with psychosis, 3 months. For patients with diabetes, dyslipidemia, or obesity, the experts would avoid clozapine, olanzapine, and conventional antipsychotics (especially low- and mid-potency). Quetiapine is first line for a patient with Parkinson's disease. Clozapine, ziprasidone, and conventional antipsychotics (especially low- and mid-potency) should be avoided in patients with QTc prolongation or congestive heart failure. For patients with cognitive impairment, constipation, diabetes, diabetic neuropathy, dyslipidemia, xerophthalmia, and xerostomia, the experts prefer risperidone, with quetiapine high second line. More than a quarter of the experts considered these combinations contraindicated: clozapine + carbamazepine, ziprasidone + tricyclic antidepressant (TCA), and a low-potency conventional antipsychotic + fluoxetine. In combining antidepressants and antipsychotics, the experts would be much more cautious with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors that are more potent inhibitors of the CYP 450 enzymes (i.e., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine) and with nefazodone, TCAs, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors. The experts recommended extra monitoring when combining any antipsychotic with lithium, carbamazepine, lamotrigine, or valproate (except aripiprazole, risperidone, or a high-potency conventional plus valproate) or with codeine, phenytoin, or tramadol.

Conclusions

The experts reached a high level of consensus on many of the key treatment questions. Within the limits of expert opinion and with the expectation that future research data will take precedence, these guidelines provide direction for common clinical dilemmas in the use of antipsychotics in elderly patients. Clinicians should keep in mind that no guidelines can address the complexities of an individual patient and that sound clinical judgment based on clinical experience should be used in applying these recommendations.

### Assessment of atypical antipsychotics in the treatment of symptoms of dementia… [^115WU7zA]. JAMA Network (2019). Excellent credibility.

© 2025 Question Which atypical antipsychotic is most beneficial and safe for the treatment of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia. Findings In this network meta-analysis of 17 studies, no significant differences were found across measures of effectiveness and safety among aripiprazole, olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone, although differences were found for some of these drugs and outcomes compared with placebo. No trials were found for other atypical antipsychotics. Risperidone was associated with an increased risk of EPSs compared with quetiapine. Quetiapine was associated with a decreased risk of EPSs compared with olanzapine. Compared with placebo, all the included AAPs were associated with a significantly increased risk of somnolence or sedation. Risperidone was associated with a decreased risk of somnolence or sedation compared with olanzapine or quetiapine. The other AAPs were not significantly different from each other. For example, previous reports corroborate ranking quetiapine as the safest and risperidone as the least safe based on EPSs. 65, 66 Quetiapine was ranked as most likely to cause somnolence or sedation, which might explain why it is commonly used as a sedative-hypnotic. The use of quetiapine was associated with a reduced risk of EPSs in comparison with olanzapine and risperidone; risperidone was associated with an increased risk compared with placebo. Patients with BPSD and either Lewy body dementia or Parkinson disease should avoid the use of risperidone to prevent worsening of EPSs.

The ranking of quetiapine and aripiprazole as the safest for avoiding EPSs supports their exclusion from the American Geriatrics Society 2015 Beers Criteria recommendation for avoiding antipsychotics in elderly patients with dementia; these 2 drugs have the lowest propensity to precipitate worsening of Parkinson disease.

### Withdrawal versus continuation of long-term antipsychotic drug use for behavioural and psychological symptoms in older people with dementia [^1145kX8T]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Antipsychotic agents are often used to treat neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in people with dementia although there is uncertainty about the effectiveness of their long-term use for this indication and concern that they may cause harm, including higher mortality. When behavioural strategies have failed and treatment with antipsychotic drugs is instituted, regular attempts to withdraw them have been recommended in guidelines. Physicians, nurses and families of older people with dementia may be reluctant to stop antipsychotics, fearing deterioration of NPS. This is an update of a Cochrane Review published in 2013.

Objectives

To evaluate whether withdrawal of antipsychotic agents is successful in older people with dementia and NPS in primary care or nursing home settings, to list the different strategies for withdrawal of antipsychotic agents in older participants with dementia and NPS, and to measure the effects of withdrawal of antipsychotic agents on participants' behaviour and assess safety.

Search Methods

We searched the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (ALOIS), theCochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS, clinical trials registries and grey literature sources up to 11 January 2018.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised, controlled trials comparing an antipsychotic withdrawal strategy to continuation of antipsychotics in people with dementia who had been treated with an antipsychotic drug for at least three months.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We rated the quality of evidence for each outcome using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included 10 studies involving 632 participants. One new trial (19 participants) was added for this update. One trial was conducted in a community setting, eight in nursing homes and one in both settings. Different types of antipsychotics at varying doses were discontinued in the studies. Both abrupt and gradual withdrawal schedules were used. Reported data were predominantly from studies at low or unclear risk of bias. We included nine trials with 575 randomised participants that used a proxy outcome for overall success of antipsychotic withdrawal. Pooling data was not possible due to heterogeneity of outcome measures used. Based on assessment of seven studies, discontinuation may make little or no difference to whether or not participants complete the study (low-quality evidence). Two trials included only participants with psychosis, agitation or aggression who had responded to antipsychotic treatment. In these two trials, stopping antipsychotics was associated with a higher risk of leaving the study early due to symptomatic relapse or a shorter time to symptomatic relapse. We found low-quality evidence that discontinuation may make little or no difference to overall NPS, measured using various scales (7 trials, 519 participants). There was some evidence from subgroup analyses in two trials that discontinuation may reduce agitation for participants with less severe NPS at baseline, but may be associated with a worsening of NPS in participants with more severe NPS at baseline. None of the studies assessed withdrawal symptoms. Adverse effects of antipsychotics (such as falls) were not systematically assessed. Low-quality evidence showed that discontinuation may have little or no effect on adverse events (5 trials, 381 participants), quality of life (2 trials, 119 participants), or cognitive function (5 trials, 365 participants). There were insufficient data to determine whether discontinuation of antipsychotics has any effect on mortality (very low-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

There is low-quality evidence that antipsychotics may be successfully discontinued in older people with dementia and NPS who have been taking antipsychotics for at least three months, and that discontinuation may have little or no important effect on behavioural and psychological symptoms. This is consistent with the observation that most behavioural complications of dementia are intermittent and often do not persist for longer than three months. Discontinuation may have little or no effect on overall cognitive function. Discontinuation may make no difference to adverse events and quality of life. Based on the trials in this review, we are uncertain whether discontinuation of antipsychotics leads to a decrease in mortality. People with psychosis, aggression or agitation who responded well to long-term antipsychotic drug use, or those with more severe NPS at baseline, may benefit behaviourally from continuation of antipsychotics. Discontinuation may reduce agitation for people with mild NPS at baseline. However, these conclusions are based on few studies or small subgroups and further evidence of benefits and harms associated with withdrawal of antipsychotic is required in people with dementia and mild and severe NPS. The overall conclusions of the review have not changed since 2013 and the number of available trials remains low.

### Treatment with atypical antipsychotics: new indications and new populations [^115quAyU]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2001). Low credibility.

Atypical antipsychotics have revolutionized the treatment of schizophrenia, becoming the treatment of choice for patients not only during their first episode, but also throughout their life course. Of note, as of 1999 more than 70% of prescriptions for these drugs are being prescribed for conditions other than schizophrenia, such as bipolar disorder and geriatric agitation. While there have been very few controlled trials that have established the efficacy of the atypical antipsychotics for these "off-label" uses, there have been a large number of open trials and case reports. The few controlled trials suggest that the atypical antipsychotics may be useful for affective disorders (both mania and depression), geriatric conditions such as senile dementia and aggression, as well as a variety of other disorders. Atypical agents may be particularly helpful for elderly, child, or adolescent patients who are especially susceptible to the side effects of medications and whose risk of tardive dyskinesia is high but further controlled studies are necessary.

Second-generation antipsychotics in dementia — mortality meta-analysis and regulatory warning: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled clinical trials in dementia included 15 trials (three aripiprazole, five olanzapine, three quetiapine, five risperidone) with 3,353 on medication and 1,757 on placebo, largely in nursing home residents (11 trials). Pooled results showed an odds ratio for death of 1.54 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 1.06–2.23, and for all medications and for 12 of the 15 trials the odds ratio favored placebo, although no single medication or trial reached statistical significance. Consistent with this, the FDA applied a "black box" warning on April 11, 2005 after analyses of 17 placebo-controlled trials showed a death rate of about 3.5% with treatment versus about 2.6% with placebo, with deaths most commonly cardiovascular or infectious.

### Cyproterone to treat aggressivity in dementia: a clinical case and systematic review [^112wNiic]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2011). Low credibility.

Aggressivity is a common problem in the management of elderly patients with dementia. Medications currently used to diminish aggressive behaviour in dementia can have problematic side effects. We present a case and systematic review of the current knowledge about the use of cyproterone acetate to treat aggressivity (excluding hypersexuality related behaviours) in dementia. An 82-year-old man required psychiatric inpatient admission due to agitation and aggressivity and was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. After failed trials of atypical antipsychotics (quetiapine 100mg/day and risperidone 1mg/day), drugs for dementia (memantine 20mg/day and rivastigmine 9mg/day) and benzodiazepines (lorazepam 0.5–1mg prn) he was started on cyproterone acetate titrated up to 50mg twice daily. After two weeks he was calmer and did not express aggressivity. Two months later he was discharged to a community placement where he subsequently remained settled on cyproterone. We reviewed literature on the use of cyproterone in aggressivity (excluding hypersexuality) associated with dementia. We searched the main medical databases including articles in English, Spanish, French and Italian. Only one randomized double-blind trial was found, comparing cyproterone with haloperidol (n = 27). Cyproterone was more effective controlling aggressivity and had lower incidence of side effects. In the one uncontrolled naturalistic observational study identified (n = 19), cyproterone was associated with significant reductions in aggressivity without causing major side effects. Further literature was limited to theoretical discussions. Despite there being evidence to support our observations of a useful role for cyproterone in aggressivity in dementia, further studies are needed to establish the efficacy and safety of this therapeutic option.

### Treatment of dementia with lewy bodies and Parkinson's disease dementia [^116puZvu]. Movement Disorders (2005). Low credibility.

Cognitive decline and dementia affect approximately 30% to 40% of patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease during the course of their illness. PD-dementia (PDD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) are second to Alzheimer's disease in causing degenerative dementia in the elderly. The nosological distinction of the conditions has remained controversial because of broad clinical and pathological overlap. Treatment issues in both clinical settings are virtually identical. Treatment of Parkinsonism is often complicated by drug-induced psychosis and reduced levodopa responsiveness. Cognition, alertness, attention, as well as apathy or aggressive behavior have been shown to respond to treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors in randomized controlled trials both in DLB and PDD. Such treatment may also improve hallucinosis, but many patients will require add-on treatment with atypical neuroleptics to control drug-induced psychotic reactions. Clozapine and quetiapine are the drugs most commonly used and, contrary to classic neuroleptics, risperidone or olanzapine do not seem to cause severe side effects according to published data.

### Treatment modifiers and predictors of risperidone response in dementia: an individual participant data meta-analysis of six randomized controlled trials [^111mYyMc]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

There are ≈ 57 million people living with dementia, and this number is projected to increase to nearly 158 million cases in 2050. Throughout the course of dementia, people often exhibit changed behaviors associated with cognitive decline, commonly referred to as behaviors and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), or sometimes described as neuropsychiatric symptoms or responsive behaviors. These include manifestations such as psychosis, aggression, agitation, anxiety, depression, changes in sleep or appetite, and apathy.BPSD are prevalent among people with dementia, with estimates reaching 32% in community‐dwelling populationsand up to 90% in hospitalized patients and nursing home residents.

Antipsychotics are often used to manage BPSD in people living with dementia, with the prevalence reaching up to 37.5%. These symptoms vary widely between individuals, and current evidence suggests that antipsychotics offer only modest benefits in treating psychosis and agitation in this population. Meanwhile, these medications can increase the risk of adverse events, including cardiovascular disease, stroke, and mortality in older people. In light of these risks, antipsychotics should only be initiated for severe symptoms or cases in which non‐pharmacological approaches prove ineffective. Therefore, identifying treatment modifiers, which are patient‐specific characteristics that define subgroups more likely to experience different benefits or risks from medication, can facilitate more targeted and effective treatment strategies. Additionally, exploring predictors of therapeutic success can help clinicians personalize treatment decisions, guiding whether to continue the current therapy or consider alternative approaches.

Individual participant data meta‐analysis (IPD‐MA) currently offers the most robust evidence for detecting subgroup effects because it can standardize data across studies and prevent ecological bias common in aggregate analyses. Furthermore, IPD‐MA can clarify whether observed effects apply uniformly or are modified by specific patient characteristics, thereby providing high‐quality evidence on treatment modifiers and predictors of an outcome. Current research on antipsychotic use in dementia has mainly relied on aggregate data meta‐analyses, or single‐trial studies, with only one IPD‐MA exploring factors associated with adverse events. To date, no IPD‐MA has been performed to investigate potential treatment modifiers or predictors of antipsychotic response across both overall and specific symptom domains of BPSD. Given that risperidone remains the only antipsychotic approved for managing BPSD in some countries, including Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and New Zealand, our study aims to use IPD‐MA to identify treatment modifiers and predictors of risperidone response in individuals with dementia experiencing different types of BPSD.

### Assessment of reported comparative effectiveness and safety of atypical antipsychotics in the treatment of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia: a network meta-analysis [^116DGPPi]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Dementia is a progressive, degenerative disorder characterized by cognitive and functional impairment. The behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), otherwise known as the neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia, represent a spectrum of noncognitive disturbances. These disturbances can include aggression, agitation, delusion, hallucination, anxiety, psychosis, depression, sleep or appetite changes, and apathy. More than 90% of patients with dementia develop at least 1 of these symptoms during the course of their disease. Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia decrease the quality of life of patients with dementia and increase their chances of being institutionalized.

Atypical antipsychotics (AAPs) include aripiprazole, olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone. Risperidone is licensed for the treatment of severe BPSD in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom but not in the United States. No other AAP has approval for this indication, so they are considered off-label when prescribed for BPSD. Evidence from pairwise meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials suggests that AAPs offer only modest improvement in BPSD but can cause serious adverse events, notably death and cerebrovascular adverse events (CVAEs). Therefore, the use of AAPs might seem unjustifiable given that their off-label use lacks strong scientific evidence and is generally associated with adverse events. Concerns about safety risks from AAPs began in 2002and there have been regulatory warnings since then from the European Medicines Agency, US Food and Drug Administration, and Health Canada. Despite these warnings, AAPs are used in about 12.3% to 37.5% of patients for the treatment of BPSD.

### Treatment modifiers and predictors of risperidone response in dementia: an individual participant data meta-analysis of six randomized controlled trials [^115TqoQp]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

5 CONCLUSION

Risperidone demonstrates modest effectiveness for treating psychosis, aggression, and anxiety in people with dementia, while showing limited impact on other symptoms. Treatment response may vary depending on individual pharmacodynamic/pharmacokinetic‐related factors. Early improvement by week 2 appears to be a strong indicator of continued response at weeks 4 and 8. Future research should focus on developing tools to better balance the risks and benefits of antipsychotic use, ultimately supporting more personalized and effective treatment decisions.

### Increased mortality with atypical antipsychotics for dementia… [^1152rKP6]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

Clinical Question: Do atypical antipsychotic medications increase the risk of death for patients with dementia. Setting: Various Study Design: Meta-analysis. Synopsis: Antipsychotic medications commonly are used to treat neuropsychiatric symptoms of depression, including aggression, agitation, and delusions. Newer atypical antipsychotic medications, including risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, and aripiprazole generally have replaced first-generation anti-psychotic medications such as haloperidol and thioridazine. However, controversy exists regarding the risk of increased mortality associated with the use of atypical antipsychotic medications in older patients with dementia.

The investigators searched MEDLINE, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, conference programs and proceedings, and pharmaceutical manufacturer databases to identify randomized controlled double-blind trials comparing orally administered antipsychotics with placebo in older patients with dementia. One individual abstracted all data and another checked the results. Both investigators reviewed data discrepancies to ensure accuracy. Fifteen trials fulfilled inclusion criteria: 3, 353 patients were randomized to active medications and 1, 757 to placebo. Most of the patients had Alzheimer's disease and were women. Monitoring occurred for an average of eight to 12 weeks. A total of 118 deaths occurred in the atypical antipsychotic medication groups compared with 40 in the placebo groups. Results were similar across the various trials.

A sensitivity analysis did not find evidence for differential risk for individual medications, severity of symptoms, or diagnosis. A formal analysis found no evidence of publication bias. Bottom Line: The use of atypical antipsychotic medications for even short periods is associated with a significantly increased risk of death. Antipsychotic medications should be used only in individual situations where there is an identifiable risk of harm and when alternate therapies have failed.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Baseline patient characteristics

The analysis included 1009 patients receiving risperidone and 712 patients receiving a placebo. Both groups had a mean age [SD] of 83 (risperidone: 83 [8]; placebo: 83 [7]) years, with males comprising 30% of the total cohort. Participants were predominantly White (88% in both groups), with median (IQR) MMSE scores of 8 (12) for risperidone and 9 (12) for placebo. The most common BPSD in both groups were aggression, followed by activity disturbances and psychosis. Mean [SD] baseline BEHAVE‐AD total scores were similar between groups (risperidone: 16 [8]; placebo: 17 [9]). Cardiovascular conditions were the predominant comorbidities (69% risperidone; 67% placebo). Hypnotics and sedatives were the most frequently used psychotropic medications at baseline (risperidone: 9.8%; placebo: 12%). Additional details of the cohort characteristics are presented in Table 1.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

We searched PubMed and the Cochrane Library databases from inception up to Feb 19, 2021, using the terms "(dement* OR Alzheimer)" and "(agitat* OR aggress*)" and "(RCT OR random*)". Only studies that had a pharmacological treatment arm and an outcome measure of agitation or aggression in people with dementia were included. Studies were required to be randomised controlled trials, or reviews and systematic reviews that reported the results of these trials. There were no language restrictions. A systematic review investigating pharmacological treatments of agitation in people with dementia included 36 randomised controlled trials (5585 participants). A combination of dextromethorphan and quinidine (odds ratio 3.04, 95% CI 1.63–5.66), risperidone (1.96, 1.49–2.59), and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants (SSRIs; 1.61, 1.02–2.53) were found to be more efficacious than placebo. However, both antipsychotics and SSRIs are associated with serious potential harms and the data for the combination of dextromethorphan and quinidine were derived from a single study. Subsequently, a single paper describing two trials of the atypical antipsychotic brexpiprazole has reported mixed results.

Added value of this study

This current study shows that the noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant mirtazapine, one of the most widely prescribed antidepressants for older people, is no more effective than placebo in the treatment of agitation in dementia. The observation of potentially higher mortality in the group receiving mirtazapine than the group receiving placebo, although not definitive, provides further reason for caution in its use for this indication.

Implications of all the available evidence

The first line of management for agitation in dementia is a full assessment to identify if there is a modifiable cause for the behaviour. In all but the most urgent of situations, the next line is non-pharmacological treatment because such approaches have been shown to be at least as effective as drug treatment. Data from this study support the active monitoring of agitation in dementia without the prescription of medication as recommended in guidelines for depression. Antipsychotics and SSRIs are associated with substantial harms when used for the treatment of agitation in dementia. This study suggests that substituting the sedative antidepressant mirtazapine to avoid such harms is not a clinically effective strategy.

### Sequential drug treatment algorithm for agitation and aggression in Alzheimer's and mixed dementia [^114EAibX]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction:

Behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) include agitation and aggression in people with dementia. BPSD is common on inpatient psychogeriatric units and may prevent individuals from living at home or in residential/nursing home settings. Several drugs and non-pharmacological treatments have been shown to be effective in reducing behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia. Algorithmic treatment may address the challenge of synthesizing this evidence-based knowledge.

Methods:

A multidisciplinary team created evidence-based algorithms for the treatment of behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia. We present drug treatment algorithms for agitation and aggression associated with Alzheimer's and mixed Alzheimer's/vascular dementia. Drugs were appraised by psychiatrists based on strength of evidence of efficacy, time to onset of clinical effect, tolerability, ease of use, and efficacy for indications other than behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia.

Results:

After baseline assessment and discontinuation of potentially exacerbating medications, sequential trials are recommended with risperidone, aripiprazole or quetiapine, carbamazepine, citalopram, gabapentin, and prazosin. Titration schedules are proposed, with adjustments for frailty. Additional guidance is given on use of electroconvulsive therapy, optimization of existing cholinesterase inhibitors/memantine, and use of pro re nata medications.

Conclusion:

This algorithm-based approach for drug treatment of agitation/aggression in Alzheimer's/mixed dementia has been implemented in several Canadian Hospital Inpatient Units. Impact should be assessed in future research.

### Pharmacotherapy for behavioural manifestations in frontotemporal dementia: an expert consensus from the European reference network for rare neurological diseases (ERN-RND) [^112hSgSK]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

In contrast, when addressing loss of empathy, 66.7% of the physicians (14 out of 21) opted not to recommend any proposed drug. Similarly, for rigidity of thought, 42.9% of physicians refrained from proposing or choosing any of the suggested treatments.

In several behavioural disturbances such as physical aggression, verbal aggression, perseverative somatic complaints or rigidity of thought, a clear consensus emerged with physicians favouring one, two or three treatments. However, for other conditions such as sexual disinhibition, self‐injury or hyperphagia, no such consensus was reached.

Amongst the behavioural disturbances, antipsychotics emerged as the most recommended for half of the symptoms (7/14), whilst SSRIs were the primary choice for 36% (5/14) of the symptoms (Figures 2a and 3a). Within the antipsychotic category, quetiapine was numerically the most selected treatment for six behavioural symptoms, including physical aggression (76.2% of all participating physicians, with a WS of 1.7 for both quetiapine and risperidone), obsessive delusions and verbal aggression (71.4% each; WS = 1.5 and WS = 1.6 respectively), nightly unrest and self‐harm due to obsessive motor behaviour (61.9% each, WS = 1.3) and sexual disinhibition (52.4%, WS = 0.9). Risperidone was the preferred choice for self‐injury (52.4%, WS = 1.2).

### American psychiatric association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. second edition [^112hzVdL]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Alzheimer's disease and other dementias — psychosis and agitation management emphasizes nonpharmacological interventions first with careful risk–benefit assessment. Clinicians must weigh the risk of not treating against the risks of active treatment and the consideration and use of behavioral, psychosocial, and psychotherapeutic treatments is particularly critical. If symptoms cause significant distress or are associated with behavior that may place the patient or others at risk, treatment with low doses of antipsychotic medication is indicated in addition to nonpharmacological interventions, and treatment with an antipsychotic is also indicated if a patient is agitated or combative in the absence of psychosis, with the use of these agents reevaluated and their benefit documented on an ongoing basis. When antipsychotics are ineffective, carbamazepine, valproate, or an SSRI may be used in a careful therapeutic trial, and a low-dose benzodiazepine may prove useful for symptoms limited to specific times or settings, noting problematic side effects in elderly patients. Although mood stabilizers and SSRIs are commonly used for agitation, delusions, and aggression, they have not been consistently shown to be effective or safe and should not be seen as having improved safety or comparable efficacy compared to antipsychotics. As illness evolves, the continued use of any intervention must be evaluated and justified on an ongoing basis, and periodic reevaluation and revision of the treatment plan, including a change in dose, a change in medication, or medication discontinuation, may be indicated, with patients whose initial symptom severity was relatively low potentially more easily withdrawn from psychotropics.

### Disparities by socioeconomic status and diagnosis of dementia in the prescribing of antipsychotics in a real-world data population over 60 years of age [^115pXTdX]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

The population group with the highest CCI scores, indicating more somatic comorbidities, showed a different pattern, the likelihood of receiving antipsychotics being lower in the population with dementia (OR: 0.91; CI: 0.85–0.97) and there being no differences in the population without dementia (OR: 1.02; CI: 0.94–1.10). The CCI is a predictor of survival and given that greater comorbidity determines a shorter life expectancy, it could explain the frequency of behavioral disorders being lower because they appear in advanced stages of dementia. The same reasoning has been applied to explain variability in dementia prevalence by gender, with higher levels of comorbidity and, therefore, shorter life expectancy in men.

Notably, quetiapine was the most widely used drug both dementia and non-dementia populations. Quetiapine is a complex medication due to its dose-dependent effects. At low doses, it is approved for the treatment of bipolar depression, and at higher doses for the treatment of manic episodes and psychotic disorders. Clinical guidelines also consider low doses of quetiapine for treating resistant depression, as a potentiation strategy. Notwithstanding its top position, its prescribing in dementia is off-label and, therefore, can be understood as poor practice if there is no concomitant mental disorder (psychosis, bipolar disorder or resistant major depression). In the Swedish study, in 2005, this top position was occupied by risperidone, in populations both with dementia and without dementia. In a sequential drug treatment algorithm for agitation and aggression in dementia, risperidone represented the first step because it had the strongest evidence for effectiveness, even though it was associated with more metabolic adverse effects than quetiapine. On the other hand, the use of quetiapine in older adults can cause serious adverse effects such as increased mortality, orthostatic hypotension, hip fractures and injuries, and metabolic disorders, and hence, when prescribed, patients should be closely monitored. We wonder what has changed in recent years to cause quetiapine to become the leading drug for the treatment of NPS in the Basque population despite all the warnings about its use in dementia patients. Various factors may explain its success. First, quetiapine carries a lower risk of extrapyramidal effects including tardive dyskinesia. Second, it has a better cardiovascular safety profile than risperidone or olanzapine. Third, its high affinity for histamine receptors and effect on D2-D2 dopamine receptors and 5HT2 serotonin receptors provide it with appreciable sedative properties. In addition, the lack of extrapyramidal effects is accompanied by a subjective sense of well-being. In contrast, risperidone is a very incisive drug that only needs low doses to block the dopamine D2 receptor to become effective in treating psychotic symptoms. Nevertheless, it is less often chosen in the elderly because it produces many extrapyramidal effects and is not assedative.

### Psychotropics and risk of death in dementia… [^1117Ew5z]. JAMA Network (2015). Excellent credibility.

Absolute change in mortality risk and NNH over 180 days of follow-up in medication users compared with nonmedication users matched on several risk factors. Among patients in whom a treatment with medication was initiated, mortality risk associated with each agent was also compared using the antidepressant group as the reference, adjusting for age, sex, years with dementia, presence of delirium, and other clinical and demographic characteristics. Secondary analyses compared dose-adjusted absolute change in mortality risk for olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone. As a group, the atypical antipsychotics showed a dose-response increase in mortality risk, with 3. 5% greater mortality in the high-dose subgroup relative to the low-dose group. The primary study outcome was 180-day mortality, with mortality data obtained from the US National Death Index.

21 Secondary analyses compared dose-adjusted absolute change in mortality risk for olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone. Sensitivity analyses evaluating only medication users with valid dose information also demonstrated increased mortality risk among the high-dose group and the risperidone group. However, the increased risk associated with olanzapine relative to quetiapine was no longer statistically significant. For the atypical antipsychotics, the NNH ranged from 27 to 50 relative to the NNH in matched nonusers. When directly comparing other medication users with patients receiving antidepressants, haloperidol had the largest associated mortality risk and quetiapine had the least risk. Comparing the atypical antipsychotics directly and controlling for dose, both risperidone and olanzapine increased mortality relative to quetiapine, although the increased risk with olanzapine was no longer significant in the sensitivity analysis limited to nonimputed data.

Our findings suggest that the mortality risk for the least harmful antipsychotic studied is double that of the initial estimate of Schneider et al8; for risperidone the mortality risk is nearly 4-fold higher. In addition, our secondary analyses demonstrated a mortality dose response, suggesting that a strategy using a high dose rather than a low dose may be associated with additional mortality.

### American psychiatric association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. second edition [^11395HhT]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Alzheimer's disease and other dementias — administration timing and frequency considerations include leveraging side effects for benefit, evening dosing to address sundowning, and dosing frequency: A more sedating agent may be given at bedtime for patients with insomnia with agitation or psychosis; antipsychotics are most commonly administered in the evening so peak levels align with evening behavioral problems; most have long half-lives so once-a-day dosing is generally sufficient, with quetiapine usually given twice daily, though morning or twice-daily dosing of other agents may help some patients.

### Sequential drug treatment algorithm for agitation and aggression in Alzheimer's and mixed dementia [^113aR4NH]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

We speculate that treatment of inpatients experiencing agitation and aggression associated with Alzheimer's or mixed dementia may be improved by bringing structure and consistency to an area where numerous putative drug treatments exist but most trials have been published relatively recently. Even when physicians familiarize themselves with which drugs are the most appropriate, they may not necessarily adopt evidence-informed dosing schedules or trial duration. However, until the present algorithm is evaluated rigorously we do not know whether it is associated with improved clinical outcomes over usual practice. We acknowledge further limitations of this paper. First, the medication algorithm was derived from a consensus of physician preferences based on the characteristics of candidate drugs as enumerated earlier. The appraisal of evidence did not involve formal systematic reviews but did require three of the authors of this manuscript (SD, AB, TR) to undertake an evaluation of existing literature on drug efficacy and tolerability and to synthesize these findings with the views of the larger physician group in terms of acceptability/applicability and ease of use. Second, the present algorithm was designed specifically for a specialist geriatric psychiatry inpatient setting and we anticipate that in other settings, such as long-term care homes, some changes to the recommended drug sequence may be indicated. Thirdly, we acknowledge that some patients or their carers may be unwilling to consent to receive antipsychotics, or indeed other specific recommended drugs. However, the algorithm has been designed to cater for this scenario by allowing any treatment or series of treatments to be skipped.

Finally, we acknowledge that no medication algorithm can be applicable to every patient. As the algorithm has been developed and applied, we have encountered situations where the prescribing psychiatrist has chosen to deviate from it (e.g. in terms of doses and duration of treatment) due to individual patient characteristics and/or observed response. While the physicians have been able to follow the algorithm's principles and dosing schedules in most cases, we recognize that physicians must retain the discretion to make decisions around drug prescription which they see as in the patient's best interest. Therefore, this document should be seen as an overarching guide to sequential drug treatment rather than a rigid schema.

Regarding medical management for behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, more specifically with respect to antipsychotics, choice of agent and dosage, CCSMH 2025 guidelines recommend to consider offering typical antipsychotics for the treatment of agitation refractory to other pharmacological treatments (including aripiprazole, brexpiprazole, and risperidone) in patients with dementia.

### Clinical outcomes and treatment patterns of older adults with dementia-related psychosis by dementia type in the United States [^111wDJ3D]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

The American Psychiatric Association recommends that only severe cases of dementia and psychosis should be treated with antipsychotics, and we observed that, at 6 months after dementia-related psychosis diagnosis, the percentage of patients treated with an antipsychotic ranged from 7% for dementia unspecified to 14% for patients with psychosis and DLB or FTD, with quetiapine being the most commonly prescribed; however, the percentage of patients under treatment with antipsychotics decreased over follow-up. The observed patterns of antipsychotic use in our study appear generally consistent with guidelines that advise providers to avoid the use of haloperidol when managing these symptoms in patients with dementia-related psychosis. Our study required patients to be free of antipsychotic use before dementia-related psychosis diagnosis — a large number of patients were excluded from the study for having antipsychotic use before receiving a psychosis diagnosis (Fig. 1) — and many patients may begin antipsychotic use before receiving a formal psychosis diagnosis. Additionally, our results showed that the use of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and antidepressants were common in patients with dementia-related psychosis. In a study of US veterans with dementia, the 10-year cumulative incidence of antipsychotic use was 51.5%. In a UK study, 30% of patients with a dementia and "psychosis symptoms and no agitation" were treated with antipsychotics. A review including studies published to 2014 reported a pooled prevalence of antipsychotic treatment among patients with dementia of 27.5%, with a higher prevalence among patients in long-term care.

### Treatment modifiers and predictors of risperidone response in dementia: an individual participant data meta-analysis of six randomized controlled trials [^11525rYN]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

4.2 Discussion of main results

Our study demonstrated that risperidone did not produce a clinically significant reduction in the BEHAVE‐AD total score but showed a modest effect in alleviating aggression, and anxieties/phobias symptoms after 4 weeks, and psychosis symptoms after 8 weeks in people with dementia. These findings align with those of a Cochrane reviewand a systematic review by Zhou et al.despite the use of mixed outcome measures, including BEHAVE‐AD and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). However, while the Cochrane review reported non‐significant effects of risperidone for psychosis, both our analysis and Zhou et al.'s review observed statistically significant benefits. This discrepancy may be explained by differences in data sources: our analysis used IPD from six trials, and Zhou et al. included a larger number of studies, while the Cochrane review relied on a smaller set of aggregate‐level data. The improvement in aggression, anxieties, and phobias might be explained by risperidone's sedative and antidepressant effects by blocking serotonin 5‐HT2A, α1 and α2 adrenergic and H1 histaminergic receptors. No statistically significant effects of risperidone on other neuropsychiatric symptoms was seen, supporting current clinical guidelines that recommend its use only for severe cases of psychosis or aggression when non‐pharmacological interventions have failed. Interestingly, risperidone appeared to worsen sleep disturbances (increase nighttime wakefulness) in individuals without such symptoms at baseline, consistent with findings from a previous open‐label trial. Antipsychotics can have both sedative and insomnia‐inducing effects, depending on their receptor activity and individual patient factors. Although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear, this observation reinforces the recommendation that risperidone be reserved for short‐term use, as treatment beyond 12 weeks is associated with an increased risk of adverse events. A previous analysis using a similar trial cohort also reported higher rates of cerebrovascular adverse events and mortality associated with risperidone use, reinforcing the need to reserve pharmacological intervention as a last resort in this population.

Methods

Literature Review

We conducted this study according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses extension statement for health care interventions. We searched the literature using the Cochrane Library, Embase, MEDLINE/PubMed, and PsychINFO databases from their inception to May 31, 2018, for studies evaluating the effectiveness and safety of AAPS for the treatment of BPSD. Key search terms included dementia, atypical antipsychotics, aripiprazole, olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine, asenapine, clozapine, iloperidone, lurasidone, paliperidone, and ziprasidone. The full search strategy is described in eTable 1 in the Supplement. Reference lists of selected articles were examined to ensure that all relevant articles published through May 2018 were identified. All titles and abstracts were independently screened by 2 of us (I.Y. A. A.), and potentially relevant articles were selected for full-text review. This full-text screening was conducted independently by the same 2 reviewers, and any disagreements were resolved by consultation with a third reviewer (T.E.).

Study Selection

Only randomized clinical trials comparing identified AAPs with placebo or head-to-head comparisons of different AAPS in adults 65 years or older with BPSD were included. We evaluated trials that compared at least 2 of the following AAPs with each other: aripiprazole, olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone. Trials that compared 1 of those AAPs with placebo were also included. Exclusion criteria were study designs other than randomized clinical trials, active-controlled trials comparing AAPs with any other medication, studies with less than 6 weeks of follow-up, and non-English articles.

### Behavioral and psychological symptoms in dementia: the role of atypical antipsychotics [^114oF9iT]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Although cognitive dysfunction is the hallmark of dementia, behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), such as psychosis, aggression, sleep disturbance, agitation, and mood disorders, develop in most elderly patients at some stage. These symptoms pose major difficulties in the day-to-day care of patients and are likely to impair the quality of life of both patient and caregiver. Patients exhibiting BPSD should be assessed in a detailed clinical interview to establish symptoms causing distress to the patient and/or caregiver. Several mood and behavior scales with good psychometric properties are available for patient evaluation. Initial intervention should focus on nonpharmacologic measures, and the quality of patient care should be optimized with potential physical, environmental, social, and psychiatric triggers being addressed where possible. Caregiver education, support, and behavioral training can also be effective in alleviating BPSD. However, pharmacologic intervention is necessary in many cases and includes use of antidepressants for mood disorders, anticonvulsants for nonpsychotic agitation, and antipsychotics for aggression, agitation, and psychotic symptoms. Conventional antipsychotics have shown modest benefit over placebo in the treatment of psychosis and agitation in dementia patients; however, they are associated with treatment-emergent side effects, particularly extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS). Atypical antipsychotics such as risperidone, olanzapine, and quetiapine are at least as effective as conventional antipsychotics, are better tolerated, and have a lower propensity for EPS. There are, however, significant differences between atypical agents with regard to receptor affinities and, therefore, side effect profiles. Patients' vulnerability to these side effects should be considered when making individual treatment decisions.
