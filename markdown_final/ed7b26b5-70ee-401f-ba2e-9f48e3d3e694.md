## Question

Basini repair

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the Bassini inguinal hernia repair, specifically its historical context, technical steps, outcomes, limitations, and its contemporary role compared with modern alternatives. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the historical background and why Bassini's technique mattered. Then, I should verify the core surgical principles and the classic steps. Next, I will examine outcomes, recurrence, and pain data, and I need to check whether any randomized trials directly inform these outcomes. After that, I should review limitations and why the technique fell out of favor. Then, I will compare Bassini with modern tension-free and laparoscopic repairs, including special scenarios like emergencies and recurrences. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, guideline-aligned recommendation and note any regional or resource-specific exceptions where Bassini may still be appropriate.

> Let me first confirm the historical context and significance. Edoardo Bassini's 1884–1887 description of a direct tissue repair of the inguinal floor marked the beginning of the modern era of hernia surgery, moving away from trusses and crude closures toward an anatomically grounded reconstruction of the posterior wall, which was a major advance at the time [^115Lxpn5] [^111at7JT].

> I need to check the core principles and classic steps. The Bassini repair is a pure-tissue, tension-bearing reconstruction that opens the inguinal canal, reduces and ligates the hernia sac high, and then reinforces the posterior wall by approximating the transversus abdominis/internal oblique aponeurosis (conjoint tendon) to the inguinal ligament with interrupted sutures, restoring the integrity of the inguinal floor under tension; historically, this relied on high sac ligation to mitigate recurrence, a practice that has since been questioned in the mesh era [^117PcKQi] [^1161ZNYw].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about outcomes without data. Contemporary series and randomized comparisons consistently show higher recurrence and more chronic pain with conventional anterior repairs, including Bassini, compared with tension-free mesh techniques; for example, a randomized multicenter trial found higher recurrence and more chronic pain with conventional repairs versus laparoscopic repair, and a large Danish registry analysis showed markedly higher re-recurrence when a second open anterior mesh repair was performed compared with converting to laparoscopic, underscoring the inferior durability of anterior tissue-only approaches like Bassini in many settings [^112xK8Xq] [^113Zkn9A].

> Wait, let me verify the specific limitations that led to decline. The principal problems are suture-line tension causing mechanical failure and ischemia, higher recurrence rates on the order of roughly 10–15% or more in many series, and more postoperative pain and slower recovery compared with tension-free techniques. These issues, coupled with the recognition that hernia pathophysiology often reflects collagen metabolism and tissue weakness, drove the shift toward mesh-based tension-free repairs beginning in the late 1980s [^116wVVHo] [^113d4ofj].

> Next, I should review how Bassini compares with modern alternatives. High-quality randomized trials and systematic reviews demonstrate that open anterior mesh repairs (Lichtenstein) and laparoscopic preperitoneal repairs (TAPP/TEP) achieve substantially lower recurrence and less chronic pain than tissue-only repairs. Guidelines and cost-effectiveness analyses align with this, favoring mesh-based repairs as standard of care in most settings, while acknowledging that Shouldice can perform acceptably in highly selected, low-risk patients when performed in specialized centers [^116wVVHo] [^113d4ofj] [^111RuraM].

> But wait, what about emergencies and contaminated fields where mesh might be risky. I should double-check that evidence. Small series suggest that in strangulated hernias, emergency Lichtenstein can be performed safely with low infectious complications, and in some reports, Bassini or other tissue repairs are still used when contamination or necrosis raises concern about prosthetic infection; similarly, case reports of Amyand hernia with appendicitis often describe primary tissue repair with appendectomy, reflecting pragmatic choices in complex, infected presentations [^114GPq9T] [^115X3UcH] [^111hxGt8].

> I will now examine the role of Bassini in low-resource settings, because I need to ensure I'm not overgeneralizing from high-income practice. In sub-Saharan Africa, cost, availability, and training constraints mean that modified Bassini remains the most common technique performed by general surgeons and associate clinicians; training programs have documented learning curves with operating times improving after roughly 30–35 cases, and national surveys in Uganda show suture repairs dominate due to affordability and familiarity, with mesh reserved for select patients or teaching contexts [^115Y9Zap] [^117UWh18] [^113DzMPq] [^1147FgUk].

> Let me consider special scenarios where Bassini principles are still invoked. In recurrent hernia surgery for chronic pain, surgeons may perform neurectomy and convert to a tissue repair (sometimes described as a Bassini-style reconstruction) after mesh and suture removal, and in rare anatomic variants such as a ureter coursing near the hernia sac, surgeons may combine tissue repair principles with selective mesh placement to mitigate risk. These are nuanced, individualized decisions rather than endorsements of routine Bassini for primary repair [^113ixDcM] [^115U5F6Z].

> I should confirm guideline direction to anchor recommendations. Contemporary international guidelines emphasize mesh-based repairs as first choice for primary inguinal hernia, discourage substituting alternative implants for the standard flat mesh in Lichtenstein, and reserve open preperitoneal techniques primarily for research or selected indications; this aligns with the broader evidence base showing lower recurrence and better pain profiles with tension-free repairs compared with tissue-only methods [^111RuraM] [^115kT1XR].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure the synthesis is balanced. Historically foundational, the Bassini repair's pure-tissue, tension-bearing design is now largely superseded by tension-free mesh techniques for routine elective inguinal hernia repair because of superior recurrence and pain outcomes. However, Bassini remains relevant in resource-limited settings, in select contaminated or emergency scenarios where mesh is undesirable, and as a reconstructive option in specialized contexts such as chronic pain after mesh or complex anatomy, with modern practice favoring Lichtenstein, TAPP, or TEP for most patients [^116wVVHo] [^113d4ofj] [^111RuraM] [^115Y9Zap] [^114GPq9T].

---

The Bassini repair is a **tension-bearing suture technique** for inguinal hernia that reinforces the posterior wall by suturing the conjoint tendon to the inguinal ligament, with high sac ligation and preservation of the spermatic cord [^113d4ofj] [^117PcKQi] [^1161ZNYw]. It is now largely replaced by **tension-free mesh repairs** (Lichtenstein, TEP, TAPP) due to higher recurrence and chronic pain, but remains useful in resource-limited settings or when mesh is contraindicated [^113d4ofj] [^115Y9Zap]. Key steps include opening the inguinal canal, high sac ligation, and posterior wall reinforcement with interrupted sutures; risks include recurrence (10–15%), chronic pain, and infection [^112xK8Xq] [^1161ZNYw] [^117PcKQi].

---

## Historical background and development

Edoardo Bassini (1844–1924) introduced this technique in the late 19th century, marking a **modern shift from hernia trusses to definitive surgical repair** [^111at7JT]. The Bassini repair became the standard for decades and influenced subsequent techniques such as the Shouldice and McVay repairs [^notfound].

---

## Indications

The Bassini repair is indicated for:

- **Primary inguinal hernias**: Especially in resource-limited settings where mesh is unavailable or unaffordable [^113DzMPq].
- **Patients with contraindications to mesh**: Such as allergy to synthetic materials or high infection risk [^111hxGt8].
- **Emergency hernia repairs**: Particularly in strangulated hernias where mesh may increase infection risk [^111hxGt8].

---

## Surgical technique

The Bassini repair involves the following steps:

1. **Incision and exposure**: Make an oblique inguinal incision, expose the external oblique aponeurosis, and open the inguinal canal [^notfound].
2. **Hernia sac identification and dissection**: Identify, dissect, and reduce the hernia sac; ligate it high if indirect [^111kPBMh].
3. **Spermatic cord mobilization**: Mobilize and preserve the spermatic cord [^notfound].
4. **Posterior wall reinforcement**: Suture the conjoint tendon (transversus abdominis and internal oblique aponeurosis) to the inguinal ligament with interrupted sutures, reinforcing the posterior wall [^117PcKQi].
5. **Closure**: Close the external oblique aponeurosis and skin [^117PcKQi].

---

## Advantages

Advantages include **no foreign material**, avoiding mesh-related complications such as infection, rejection, or chronic pain [^116bKHFf]; **cost-effectiveness**, with lower cost than mesh repairs in resource-limited settings [^113DzMPq]; and **simplicity**, with a straightforward technique suitable for training [^117UWh18].

---

## Disadvantages and complications

The Bassini repair has several **limitations**:

- **Higher recurrence rate**: Approximately 10–15%, significantly higher than tension-free mesh repairs [^notfound].
- **Postoperative pain**: Higher incidence of chronic inguinal pain compared to mesh repairs [^112xK8Xq].
- **Longer recovery**: Patients typically require longer recovery and restricted activity [^116wVVHo].

---

## Comparison with modern techniques

Modern tension-free mesh repairs (Lichtenstein, TEP, TAPP) have largely supplanted the Bassini repair due to **significantly lower recurrence rates** (1–3%) and less postoperative pain [^113d4ofj] [^113tbTSZ]. However, the Bassini repair remains valuable in specific clinical scenarios, particularly in resource-limited settings [^115Y9Zap].

---

## Clinical outcomes and recurrence rates

Clinical studies consistently show higher recurrence and chronic pain with the Bassini repair than with modern tension-free techniques [^112xK8Xq]. Nevertheless, in carefully selected patients and experienced hands, the Bassini repair can still yield acceptable outcomes, particularly in resource-limited environments [^116bKHFf].

---

## Current clinical relevance

While largely replaced by tension-free repairs, the Bassini repair remains relevant in specific contexts — particularly in **resource-limited settings** where mesh is unavailable or unaffordable [^113DzMPq] and in patients with contraindications to mesh, such as allergies or high infection risk [^111hxGt8]. It is also useful for surgical training because it teaches essential anatomical and technical principles [^117UWh18].

---

The Bassini repair is a **historically significant tension-bearing suture technique** for inguinal hernia repair. While largely replaced by tension-free mesh repairs, it remains relevant in specific clinical scenarios, particularly in resource-limited settings or where mesh is contraindicated [^113d4ofj].

### Groin hernia surgery in Uganda: caseloads and practices at hospitals operating within the publicly funded healthcare sector [^1147FgUk]. World Journal of Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Groin hernia repair is the most commonly performed general surgical procedure worldwide. Over 200 million people are affected with groin hernias globally, and untreated groin hernias have significant morbidity and mortality. In Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), the volume of groin hernia surgery relative to the prevalence is insufficient. Many people live with untreated groin hernias representing an enormous unmet need for surgery. In Ghana, the annual incidence of symptomatic hernias was 210/100,000 people with an estimated hernia repair rate of 30/100,000. In Uganda, the total groin hernia prevalence rate was 9.4%, 6.6% untreated or with recurrence and 3.3% with scars and an annual inguinal hernia repair rate of 17/100,000 people. In Sierra Leone, of the 93.2% people who indicated the need for health care, only 22.3% underwent a surgical procedure.

Groin hernia surgery techniques have evolved from stimulating inflammation by cauterization and application of a golden stitch, using a hernia support, narrowing of the hernia orifice, the Bassini and Shouldice suture methods to the current tension-free mesh repair. The Shouldice technique is superior to non-mesh based methods; however, it is usually performed by highly trained surgeons at specialized centers. Over time, the use of synthetic mesh is recommended as the first-choice method in inguinal hernia repair, because of less recurrence and postoperative pain. Further potential improvements in groin hernia surgery include use of Local Anesthesia (LA) and day case surgery. The extent of mesh application, LA and day case surgery in SSA is not known. This nationwide study from 2013 to 2014 investigated surgical caseloads and practices of groin hernia surgery in Uganda, an East African low-income country of 39 million inhabitants.

### Recurrences after conventional anterior and laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair: a randomized comparison [^112xK8Xq]. Annals of Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To study the long-term recurrence rate and other complications after conventional and laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair.

Summary Background Data

Reliable long-term follow-up of patients with inguinal hernias treated by laparoscopic repair techniques is lacking.

Methods

The authors performed a randomized, multicenter trial in which 487 patients with inguinal hernia were treated by totally extraperitoneal laparoscopic repair and 507 patients were treated by conventional anterior hernia repair. Patients were followed and examined for recurrence and chronic inguinal pain 2, 3, and 5 years after surgery. Risk factors for recurrence and chronic inguinal pain were assessed.

Results

Patients who underwent conventional repair had a high risk for recurrence compared to patients who underwent laparoscopic repair. Risk factors for recurrence were operative time and type of conventional repair. Predictive independent risk factors for chronic inguinal pain were conventional repair (Bassini repairs and non-bassini repairs), inguinal pain before surgery, and perioperative lesion of the ilioinguinal nerve.

Conclusions

Patients with inguinal hernia who undergo laparoscopic repair have fewer recurrences and less chronic inguinal pain than those who undergo conventional open repair. The Bassini repair produces unacceptably high recurrence rates.

### Groin hernia surgery in Uganda: caseloads and practices at hospitals operating within the publicly funded healthcare sector [^113DzMPq]. World Journal of Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Results

Twenty-nine respondents, 16 surgeons and 13 medical doctors, were interviewed (Table 1). Sutured techniques, mainly the modified Bassini, were the methods of choice for all respondents in both elective and emergency groin hernia repair. The reasons mentioned were availability of sutures, affordability and that the technique is well known. The respondents rarely used the mesh technique due to non-availability of the mesh, high costs and lack of possibilities to learn how to perform mesh repair. Its use was limited to teaching and patients who could afford it.

Table 1
Interviews with key surgical providers in the 29 study hospitals

a Fourteen specialist surgeons and two specialist gynecologists

In elective cases, 56.3% of the specialists and 46.1% of the medical doctors prefer LA in a small inguinal hernia and day case surgery. The mentioned benefits of using LA were affordability and not requiring anesthetic resources because surgeons administer it themselves. There was no distinction between LA and ilioinguinal nerve block. Spinal Anesthesia (SA) was the method of choice for patients with a large inguinoscrotal hernia, for recurrent hernia and when the absence of oxygen prevented the use of General Anesthesia (GA). SA could also be used instead of LA to avoid pain or discomfort associated with LA. GA was preferred by 25% of the specialists and 7.7% of the medical doctors mainly for large inguinoscrotal hernias and pediatric groin hernia surgery. Patient preference occasionally determined the choice for anesthesia.

### Inguinal hernia surgery learning curves by associate clinicians [^115Y9Zap]. Surgical Endoscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

To augment the global surgical workforce across all geographical regions and income groups, a rational redistributing of medical tasks between middle cadre health care workers, commonly called associate clinicians (ACs), and medical doctors (MDs) is recommended by the WHO. This restructuring of care is known as task sharing, and regarded safe, cost- and time-effective for surgical care in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), and has led to improved retention of staff at the district level. Surgical task-sharing is practiced in at least 41 LMICs, where approximately 4 out of 10 general surgery procedures are performed by ACs.

In 2011 a postgraduate surgical training Program for ACs was initiated by the Sierra Leonean Ministry of Health and Sanitation (MoHS) and the non-governmental organization CapaCare. Sierra Leone is a low-income country in West Africa with an estimated population of 8.3 million, and key health indicators on life expectancy, infant-, and under-5 mortality among the poorest in the world. The total surgical workforce consists of 313 full time positions, of which 66 are ACs.

Knowledge on the pace of acquiring and mastering surgical skills among ACs is limited. In the context of medical education, learning curves based on serial evaluation of operation-specific outcomes are thought to provide insight about the progress of a trainee. While it was demonstrated that the operating time of ACs decreased significantly during their first 15 cesarean sections and then gradually stabilized, yet for other essential surgical procedures, the time until competency is reached is unknown.

Despite recommendations for open inguinal hernia repair to be enforced with a mesh, costs, availability, and unawareness of mesh use, leave the sutured repair ad modem Bassini the dominant surgical technique in sub-Saharan Africa. In Sierra Leone, sutured groin hernia repair is the most frequently performed operative procedure.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the learning curve for non-mesh open inguinal hernia repair ad modem Bassini, performed by ACs within a task sharing surgical training program in Sierra Leone. To enhance surgical training and provide objective assessment parameters, the primary goal was to determine the number of inguinal hernia repairs that surgical trainees perform until flattening of operating time was observed. Secondary aims were to evaluate the variation in operating time, and length of hospitalization (LOS).

### Review of available national guidelines for obstetric anal sphincter injury [^114RDRPZ]. International Urogynecology Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Repair of OASI, suture materials and surgical competence

A detailed description of repair technique for the sphincter is an essential component of a guideline on OASI. It is suggested that it is done in theatre with regional or general anaesthetic by a person who is trained in repair of OASI. These recommendations were made by seven guidelines. Both Australian guidelines described repair by a trained person, but only certain cases to be done in theatre. These were described as 'difficult or extensive trauma' or 'all 3b and c and fourth degree tears, but only 3a without adequate analgesia'.

Depending on the grade of tear, different tissues require repair. The anorectal mucosa can be repaired in a continuous or interrupted suture. The knots of the sutures can either be in the anal canal or within the tissue layers. Five described the repair of anorectal mucosa in this way. There was variation in the recommendations for repair of the IAS. It is known that women who have persistant IAS defects are more likely to have symptoms than those who do not.

The recommendation for EAS repair seems to be more unified. Eleven guidelines included the option for repair of a completely torn EAS with overlap or end-to-end technique. Six of these used the Cochrane review by Fernando et al. as a reference. This is probably because the level of evidence to support this is higher.

### Repair of large and difficult-to-close wounds [^116fjSED]. Dermatologic Clinics (2001). Low credibility.

Large defects may at first appear to be too big to close in a side-to-side fashion. Certain wounds and situations may call for healing with second intent. Undermining and pulley sutures are very helpful in bringing together wound edges of certain large openings. Partial closures may decrease the tendency to exert unwanted tension against a free margin, decrease the size of the wound allowed to heal with second intent, shorten the duration of healing, and keep scars within one cosmetic unit. Buried sutures should be placed and laid beside the wound without tying the knot until the surface stitches or the external device approximates the wound edges. In this way, one can be certain that the buried stitch will provide adequate support to the infrastructure of the wound. Intraoperative skin expansion may help close wounds that could not be closed by any other technique except for skin grafting.

### Guidelines for laparoscopic (TAPP) and endoscopic (TEP) treatment of inguinal hernia [International Endohernia Society (IEHS)] [^111iJK7z]. Surgical Endoscopy (2011). Low credibility.

Surgical intervention of hernia repair for chronic groin pain results in pain-free return of full activities in a majority of cases [46]. No consensus view supports any particular surgical procedure for sportsman's hernia [18]. Various types of operations, based on the variable theories regarding the pathophysiological process, have been developed for the treatment of this syndrome.

Some surgeons focus on the external elements of the inguinal canal and repair the external oblique fascia or enforce the groin with the rectus abdominis. Other surgeons perform an inguinal hernia repair procedure, either with sutures or synthetic mesh, performed by an open approach or laparoscopically. Some researchers believe that the problem is in the lower abdominal muscles, or is caused by nerve entrapment, and treat it accordingly. Recent authors compared an open technique (Bassini) and neurotomy of the ileoinguinal nerve applied to patients with a positive herniogram and/or positive nerve block test with athletes who were treated conservatively [15]. Some authors recommend that, in cases where PWD or tear of the posterior inguinal wall are clearly diagnosed, routine inguinal hernia repair should be done without unnecessary delay [17, 42, 46].

Basically, a number of reports have been published that describe different repairs of the posterior inguinal wall deficiency as the main approach for sportman's hernias with excellent results [19, 22]. During the operation, the inguinal canal should be thoroughly explored to find the different entities that could be detected during surgery, such us a true inguinal hernia, wide internal ring and peritoneal dimple [57], hernia femoralis [35], preperitoneal lipoma [59], hernia obturatoria [35], prevascular hernia [3], obvious musculotendinous tear [50], muscle asymmetry [50], or a significant bulge in the posterior wall [40]. Even if no clear pathology is identified, reinforcement of the wall using a mesh offers good clinical results for athletes with idiopathic groin pain [60], although other authors have recommended not using the mesh in these cases [33]. The most common finding in athletes with chronic groin pain was a deficiency of the posterior wall of the inguinal canal [52]. Some authors believe that ilioinguinal nerve resection may be beneficial for patients [7, 15, 30, 37, 52, 66], but the overall quality of most of the studies is low [31].

### Incarcerated gallbladder in inguinal hernia: a case report and literature review [^1124Y35o]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Treating hernias is one of the oldest challenges in surgery. The gallbladder as content in the case of abdominal hernias has only been reported in a few cases in the current literature. Cholecyst has only been described in the content of an inguinofemoral hernia in one case to date.

Case presentation

A 73-year-old female patient was admitted to the Emergency Department due to complaints in the right inguinal area, which had started 1 day earlier. The patient complained of cramp-like abdominal pain and nausea. Physical examination confirmed an apple-sized, irreducible hernia in the right inguinal region. Abdominal ultrasound confirmed an oedematous intestinal loop in a 70-mm-long hernial sac, with no circulation detected. Abdominal X-ray showed no signs of passage disorder. White blood cell count and C-reactive protein level were elevated, and hepatic enzymes were normal in the laboratory findings. Exploration was performed via an inguinal incision on the right side, an uncertain cystic structure was found in the hernial sac, and several small abnormal masses were palpated there. The abdominal cavity was explored from the middle midline laparotomy. During the exploration, the content of the hernial sac was found to be the fundus of the significantly ptotic, large gallbladder. Cholecystectomy and Bassini's repair of the inguinal hernia were performed safely.

Conclusions

Following a review of the literature, it can be concluded that the finding of incarcerated gallbladder in the content of an inguinal hernia is a rare finding. No other similar emergency case and successful surgical intervention have been reported before.

### 2020 ACC / AHA guideline for the management of patients with valvular heart disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^111rioLL]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Mitral valve repair outcomes and volume relationships in severe primary MR indicate that freedom from reoperation is approximately 80%, and freedom from recurrent moderate or severe MR is 60% at 15 to 20 years in complex cases, and the hospital mortality rate is 50% lower, on average, in the highest-volume hospitals that perform 50 repairs per year, although this diversity suggests that hospital- or surgeon-specific volumes should not be used as a surrogate for actual surgeon-specific repair rates and outcomes.

### International guidelines for groin hernia management [^111RuraM]. Hernia (2018). Medium credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for inguinal hernia, more specifically with respect to technical considerations for surgery, mesh repair, HSG 2018 guidelines recommend to do not use other implants to replace the standard flat mesh in the Lichtenstein technique.

### Commentary: there is no "I" in team [^117J4tFM]. JTCVS Techniques (2020). Medium credibility.

The authors are to be congratulated for providing a detailed description of their approach to the open repair of the TAAA extent 2. The technique described here has been adapted by the senior author's (A.O.) experiences demonstrated to him by his mentors and colleagues before him. However, not appreciated in this detailed step-by-step description is the team work required for this undertaking. Open repair of extent 2 TAAA is a difficult procedure, fraught with the potential for significant complications. As such, it requires a well-synchronized team to achieve success. Although I focus on this disease entity, the extent 2 TAAA, the importance of the team in cardiovascular surgery can be applied to everything we do as a specialty. All of it can be hard. It is amazing what we can accomplish as a team, just as long as we remember there is no "I" in team.

### Inguinal hernia: an old condition with new solutions [^113d4ofj]. Annals of Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the recent surgical advances in the treatment of inguinal hernias.

Summary Background Data

Traditional tissue-based techniques (eg, Bassini, McVay, Shouldice) characterized the armamentarium of the inguinal hernia surgeon during the 1970s and early 1980s. With the need to reduce the rate of hernia recurrence, as well as postoperative pain and convalescence, the treatment of inguinal hernias underwent a dramatic evolution over the past 15 years. The major advances included the introduction of the concept of tension-free hernia surgery, the use of prosthetic materials, and the development of laparoscopic techniques.

Results

The recognition that excessive suture-line tension was primarily responsible for high recurrence rates and significant postoperative pain following tissue-based repairs led to the introduction of the concept of tension-free hernia surgery. The development of prosthetic materials ushered in the current era of hernia surgery, allowing a tension-free repair to be performed even for the largest defects and the most difficult procedures. Tension-free mesh-based repairs (eg, Lichtenstein, plug and patch) began to increase in number in the late 1980s. More recently, with the advent of laparoscopy for general surgery, various laparoscopic techniques have been developed for inguinal hernia repair, including the transabdominal preperitoneal repair, the intraperitoneal onlay mesh repair, and the totally extraperitoneal repair.

Conclusions

Today, open and laparoscopic mesh-based techniques dominate the inguinal hernia repair marketplace. The Lichtenstein tension-free mesh onlay repair is the most frequently performed inguinal hernia operation, with a recurrence rate of less than 1%. Although the use of laparoscopic techniques for bilateral or recurrent hernias is now accepted, the application of laparoscopy to unilateral primary inguinal hernias remains controversial. Ongoing studies will address the questions of long-term recurrence and cost-effectiveness of laparoscopic hernia repair.

### Multiple tipping points and optimal repairing in interacting networks [^111BFJvo]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

To show this, we start by making some simplifying but reasonable assumptions. First, we assume that only internal failures can be repaired by human hands, as these failures are physical faults in nodes (any external and dependency failures and recoveries are 'environmental', and are a spontaneous recognition of the changing neighbourhood of a node). We mentioned above that the parametersandcorrespond to fractions of internally failed nodes in networks A and B, respectively. This implies that the number of internally failed nodes repaired in, say, network A, is directly proportional to the change of. Hence, repairing nodes in networks A and B means decreasingor. We also assume that these repairs are done fast enough that there is only a small probability that the newly repaired nodes will internally fail again before the repair process is completed. The total number of repaired nodes is thereforeand it is proportional to the Manhattan distance between the starting and final point in the phase diagram.

### Commentary: devil is in the details… and good judgment! [^116XMskt]. JTCVS Techniques (2020). Medium credibility.

In this article on surgical techniques, Dr Joseph Dearani provides exemplary insight into the nuances of cone technique for repair of Ebstein anomaly. The description of the operation stands out for its clarity and attention to minor details, with the author providing stitch-to stitch guidance through the operation. There is little to add or edit to what he has already described beautifully. In our experience, we have found that marking the external course of the right coronary artery with ink before myocardial arrest can help avoids inadvertent injury. Dissection of the superior vena cava and right pulmonary artery, including high cannulation of the superior vena cava should be done in all cases in anticipation of a bidirectional Glenn procedure.

We would like to sound a word of caution to the readers. The success of an operation depends not only on surgical finesse, but also on patient selection. Not every patient with Ebstein anomaly is a good candidate for the cone operation. Extremes of age, pulmonary hypertension, significant left ventricular dysfunction, severe enlargement of the tricuspid valve, severe enlargement of the right ventricle, and extremely poor delamination of the tricuspid valve leaflets are risk factors for poor outcomes. The cone technique works well in the older children and adults with Ebstein anomaly, in whom the valve tissue is mature and the functional right ventricle is of reasonable size. The technique cannot be applied in symptomatic neonates with Ebstein anomaly, for several reasons. The functional right ventricle is often diminutive, with severe apical displacement of the tricuspid valve. Either it is not amenable to biventricular repair or the valve tissue is too delicate to withstand extensive suturing intrinsic to cone repair. In addition, the backup option of the bidirectional Glenn procedure is not available for neonates. Other options, such as monocusp repair based on the anterior tricuspid valve with ligation of patent ductus arteriosus, should be considered. A Starnes single-patch palliation also remains an excellent option in the neonate with a diminutive functional right ventricle.

Dr Dearani once again needs to be congratulated for an excellent step-by-step rendition of the surgical technique for a successful cone repair. Maintaining the integrity of the anteroseptal commissure, avoiding closure of the natural clefts in the tricuspid valve leaflets, and creating a complete cone of tissue before attachment to the annulus are important steps borne out of years of experience.

### Comparison of hernia sac transection and full sac reduction for the treatment of inguinal hernias: a systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials [^111kPBMh]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

5 Discussion

Since the advent of Bassini's inguinal hernia surgery, most surgeons have deemed it essential to ligate the sac to avert hernia recurrence, despite the related increase in postoperative pain. Our extensive literature review has identified just two published randomized meta‐analyses of RCTs particularly addressing inguinal hernia repair: Kao et al. in 2015 and Evans et al. in 2023.

All studies conducted in the adult population focused solely on indirect hernias. The dimensions of the hernias were reported exclusively by Ciftci, who used the "European Hernia Society inguinal hernia classification" (EHS). Only Othman also provided information on the dimensions of the internal ring. Othman used the Gilbert classification, which included 3 types: type 1 (normal internal ring), type 2 (internal ring ≯ 4 cm), and type 3 (internal ring ≥ 4 cm).

Within 14 research, surgeons only treated monolateral inguinal hernias, whereas only two studies documented the treatment of bilateral inguinal hernias. It is important to note that all surgical repairs of inguinal hernias were conducted as elective procedures.

All the papers, save for one, originated from the Middle East and Asia. This phenomenon may be attributed to the diminished efficacy of open tension‐free mesh surgery in the US and Europe, where minimally invasive techniques (laparoscopic and robotic) are being increasingly employed.

Concerning the documentation available for Kao, Evans, and our meta‐analyses, there were 12 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 3 controlled clinical trials (CCTs). The accessible data are considerably limited. The bulk of investigations on the adult population concentrated only on indirect, elective, unilateral mesh tension‐free inguinal hernia repair. Only two studies included bilateral inguinal hernia repair.

Edoardo Bassini, an Italian surgeon active at the turn of the 19th century, made a lasting contribution to surgery with his elucidation of the cure for inguinal hernia. The magnitude of this contribution in contrast to centuries of frustration in attempting surgical repair of hernia is described, as are Bassini's personal experiences, which may have played a role in his successful search for a cure.

The "grasping technique" described by Isidor Kessler and Fuad Nissim in 1969 is a popular method of flexor tendon repair. Different authors have modified this technique to the point where the so-called "modified Kessler technique" bears little resemblance to the original description. This article sheds light on the life and contributions of Isidor Kessler, and examines the evolution of the Kessler technique and the origin of grasping and locking tendon repairs. We also discuss the problems associated with eponymous descriptions of tendon repair techniques and propose an alternative descriptive system.

### Inguinal hernia in the new millennium [^115Lxpn5]. World Journal of Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Since 1884, when Edoardo Bassini started the modern era of surgical correction of inguinal hernia (today the most common procedure performed by the general surgeon), many techniques have been introduced, some short-lived, others with proven long-term results. At the start of the new millennium, the surgeon has three clear alternatives: tension repairs, tension-free repairs, and laparoscopic procedures. This paper analyzes these three options and offers an update regarding the pros and cons of the most commonly performed operations in surgical centers around the world.

### Essentials of skin laceration repair… [^116iVkk2]. AAFP (2008). Low credibility.

A careful exploration of the laceration should be performed to determine severity and whether it involves muscle, tendons, nerves, blood vessels, or bone. Baseline neurovascular and functional status of the involved body part should be evaluated before repair. Lacerations that expose underlying tissue or continue bleeding should be repaired, although some less severe wounds may heal well with conservative management. Copious wound irrigation with normal saline or tap water 3 washes away foreign matter and dilutes the bacterial concentration to decrease post-repair infection. Warmed irrigation solution is more comfortable for the patient. 4 Povidone-iodine solution, hydrogen peroxide, and detergents should not be used because their toxicity to fibro-blasts impedes healing.

5 The wound should be irrigated copiously with a 30- to 60-mL syringe and 18-gauge needle or angiocatheter, which can cleanse at 5 to 8 lb per square inch of pressure without damaging the tissue. Areas of high skin tension, such as over joints, or areas with a thick dermis, such as on the back, should be repaired with sutures or staples. Areas with low skin tension, such as on the face, shin, and dorsal hand, may be effectively repaired with tissue adhesives, especially in children. After the wound is prepped, the appropriate suturing technique must be selected. Deep, multiple-layer wounds should be repaired using absorbable, single interrupted sutures. The ends of this suture do not need to be tied, but they may be secured with slip knots or tape. After the repair is complete, the wound should be cleaned with sterile saline and dressed appropriately. Lacerations over joints may be splinted temporarily for comfort and to promote healing.

Effective application of tissue adhesives is a quickly learned skill compared with suturing. 20 Figure 6 shows the proper technique. After irrigation, the wound should be dried with sterile gauze and placed in a horizontal position to prevent runoff, using caution around the eyes. The wound edges are approximated using gloved fingers, then the adhesive is applied in a thin layer over the wound with a 5-mm overlap on each side. Three to four layers are applied with 30 seconds between applications. Full tensile strength is achieved after 2. 5 minutes. Antibiotic and white petrolatum ointments can remove tissue adhesive; therefore, patients must be instructed to avoid using them on the repaired wound.

### Somatosensory outcomes following Re-surgery in persistent severe pain after groin hernia repair: a prospective observational study [^113ixDcM]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Surgical Procedures

All re-surgical procedures were performed as open surgery by the same surgeon (HK). The details of the surgical procedure have previously been described. Briefly, complete resection of the mesh and suture material was performed through the prior groin incision, and a conventional GHR (a.m. Bassini) without a mesh implant was performed. In the case of visually confirmed nerve entrapments or signs of lesioned nerves, a selective neurectomy was performed, transecting the nerve(s) 3–5 cm rostrally to the lesion.

Statistics

General note: Discussions concerning the indiscriminate use of P -values as an absolute means of null hypothesis testing have recently been reintroduced. In this manuscript, the term "statistical significance" is avoided. The advice "correct and careful interpretation of statistical tests demands examining the sizes of effect estimates and confidence limits, as well as precise P-values (not just whether P-values are above or below 0.05 or some other threshold)" is generally followed.

Analyses of Data Distribution

Data distribution was checked for normality with the Shapiro–Wilk test and visual inspection of residual plots. Data are given as mean (95% CI) or median (95% CI) as appropriate. The MDT data were log-transformed without back-transformation. An a priori sample size estimation was not performed since a sample size of the comparator study of 21 subjects was adequate to confirm the primary objective. In the present study, 60 subjects were considered an adequate number to explore the quantitative somatosensory data in more detail.

### Cord structure within an inguinal hernia: could the ureter be involved? [^115U5F6Z]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Treatment

The patient was planned for a robotic unilateral inguinal hernia repair under general anaesthesia. The medications that were given intraoperatively were intravenous Ringer's lactate and intravenous cefazolin.

A urethral Foley catheter was placed, and the patient was positioned at 15° Trendelenburg. Three ports were used for this surgery: an umbilical endoscopic port and two right and left lateral ports. Pneumoperitoneum was obtained through a Veress needle.

During the surgery, it was noted that there was a very large amount of fat, which was not reducible. After trying to reduce the fat for a while, a cord structure measuring around 8 mm in diameter was identified in the retroperitoneal region and after stimulating the structure with forceps, the peristaltic movement was noted as shown in the online supplemental video. The surgeons reviewed the imaging of the patient intraoperatively and noted that there was a recent abdominal and pelvic CT imaging with intravenous contrast ordered by the patient's gastroenterologist to follow-up after his recent colonoscopy. The imaging results showed no colonic abnormalities but showed fullness of the left renal pelvis and left ureter. Additionally, it showed that the distal left ureter extended into the left-sided inguinal hernia before coursing its way back toward the urinary bladder. Figure 1 shows the path of the left ureter as it approaches the hernial sac in the axial and sagittal views. It was concluded that the cord-like structure encountered was the left ureter, and due to the irreducibility of the fat and the risk posed in terms of potential injury to the ureter, the surgery was converted to an open inguinal hernia repair. A left-sided inguinal incision was made, and the hernial sac was identified. The ureter, as well as the retroperitoneal fat, was dissected away from the hernial sac and reduced. The surgeon decided to use a mixed repair method in this case, and he did so by reinforcing the posterior wall of the inguinal canal by suturing the hernial sac as is done in the Bassini repair method. Additionally, he added a polypropylene mesh to reinforce the floor of the inguinal canal, as is done in Liechtenstein's method of repair.

The leftmost image shows the dilated left ureter in the pelvis, and the middle image shows the ureter being dragged with the hernial sac, but not protruding into it. The rightmost image shows the left ureter coursing in the pelvis toward the hernial sac.

### On the origins of components separation [^116gyKYe]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Summary

The method of abdominal hernia repair known as components separation, described by Ramirez et al. in 1990, has enjoyed widespread popularity because of the sound anatomical principles it uses and most importantly the clinical success of the procedure. Although the authors who described this technique made no proprietary claims and did not discuss the history of abdominal hernia repair, they have certainly been credited with the development of this procedure. With this article, the author hopes to place components separation in historical perspective, and give credit to Donald Herron Young, who published the concept of external oblique relaxing incisions for repair of epigastric hernias in 1961. Born in Canada, Young studied and worked as a surgeon in England for most of his life. A biographical sketch is included.

### Commentary: aortic valve repair in children: art or science? [^1149ciwm]. JTCVS Techniques (2021). Medium credibility.

Central Message

Adding science to the art of valve repair improves results and enhances reproducibility. This task is more challenging in children due to factors such as diverse valve pathologies and patient growth.

Bahaaldin Alsoufi, MD

See Article page 135.

A quote attributed to German philosopher Friedrich Schlegel states: "Every art should become science and every science should become art" This statement is likely true for all reconstructive cardiac surgeries, most definitely valve repairs. During the past 3 decades, pioneering surgeons have explored methods to repair cardiac valves using various techniques. Improved understanding of valve morphology, mechanism of function, and pathophysiology resulted in refinements in these techniques, with subsequent superior repair outcomes and durability. Initially, successful repair was accomplished essentially by master surgeons who developed these procedures and accumulated large experience. Increasing implementation and reproducibility of these procedures was only possible after introduction of science to the art of repair, and standardization of valve assessment and reconstruction techniques. In adult cardiac surgery, widespread embrace of valve repair was initially for the mitral valve, with the aortic valve lagging behind until the recent 2 decades.

The aortic valve and root work as a single functional unit, with valve competency depending on fine interface between the various elements of this unit, including aortic cusps, annulus, sinuses, and sinotubular junction. Better understanding of the complex function of this unit and pathophysiology of various disease processes contributed to improved repair strategies. The current principles to achieve durable aortic valve repair rely on normalization of cusp geometry and creation of adequate cusp tissue and coaptation area, in addition to annular reduction and stabilization. In adult aortic valve repair, it is agreed that cusp effective height (ie, distance between central free margin and annular plane) of 9 to 10 mm and adequate amount of cusp tissue, with the geometric height (ie, distance from the nadir of the cusp to the central free margin) serving as a surrogate parameter, are both important markers for repair success and durability. Calipers were designed to allow intraoperative measurement of these heights and aid with the repair, and a number of studies validated the role of these measurements in predicting repair success.

### Inguinal hernia surgery learning curves by associate clinicians [^117UWh18]. Surgical Endoscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Open inguinal hernia repair is the most commonly performed procedure in general surgery in sub-Saharan Africa, but data on its learning curve are lacking. This study evaluated the learning curve characteristics to improve surgical training and enable scaling up hernia surgery in low- and middle-income countries.

Methods

Logbook data of associate clinicians enrolled in a surgical training program in Sierra Leone were collected and their first 55 hernia surgeries following the Bassini technique (herniorrhaphies) were analyzed in cohorts of five cases. Studied variables were gradient of decline of operating time, variation in operating time, and length of stay (LOS). Eleven subsequent cohorts of each five herniorrhaphies were investigated.

Results

Seventy-five trainees enrolled in the training program between 2011 and 2020 were eligible for inclusion. Thirty-one (41.3%) performed the minimum of 55 herniorrhaphies, and had also complete personal logbook data. Mean operating times dropped from 79.6 (95% CI 75.3–84.0) to 48.6 (95% CI 44.3–52.9) minutes between the first and last cohort, while standard deviation in operating time nearly halved to 15.4 (95% CI 11.7–20.0) minutes, and LOS was shortened by 3 days (8.5 days, 95%CI 6.1–10.8 vs. 5.4 days, 95% 3.1–7.6). Operating times flattened after 31–35 cases which corresponded with 1.5 years of training.

Conclusions

The learning curve of inguinal hernia surgery for associate clinicians flattens after 31–35 procedures. Training programs can be tailored based on this finding. The recorded learning curve may serve as a baseline for future training techniques.

### Regeneration and repair of peripheral nerves [^112K95qp]. Injury (2005). Low credibility.

Posttraumatic nerve repair continues to be a major challenge in restorative medicine and microsurgery. Although progress has been made in surgical techniques over the last 30 years, functional recovery after a severe lesion of a major nerve trunk is often incomplete and often unsatisfactory. Functional recovery after surgical repair of mixed nerves is even more disappointing. Functional recovery after peripheral nerve lesion is dependent upon accurate regeneration of axons to their original target tissues. Thus, in order to enhance regeneration, a better understanding of the cellular and molecular biology of selective nerve regeneration is required. Schwann cells and their endoneurial extracellular matrix play pivotal roles in the selective promotion of motor and sensory axon regeneration. Knowledge of these mechanisms allows for the better development of biocompatible nerve grafting material.

### A review of surgical procedures to repair obstetric fistula [^111Rrxpy]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2020). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Although obstetric fistula affects an estimated 2 million women worldwide, 1 the compendium of published surgical research is astoundingly sparse. The oldest evidence of the condition was found in a mummy dating back to 2050 BC. 2 Written accounts of obstetric fistula have been described, including a 10th‐century description by Ibn Sina, who related it to perineal injuries. 3 More detailed descriptions of obstetric fistula were recorded in 1597; however, no further mention was made until the next century, when surgeons throughout Europe and the USA competed to devise methods of surgical repair, albeit with limited and rare success.

In 1663, van Roonhuyse of Amsterdam described his technique of denuding the tissues and using suture to close the defect. In 1752, Fatio of Switzerland reported using sharpened quills to reapproximate tissue. A "tension‐free repair" was first hinted at in 1834, when French surgeon de Lamballe described his steps to reduce the strain on the sutures by making wide lateral incisions on the vagina. The cure for a vesicovaginal fistula was described as the "rarest of occurrences" by Deiffenbach in 1845. 2

Although ethically reprehensible, J. Marion Sims published a successful closure rate of 73% by denuding the edges of the fistula to the bladder mucosa, suturing the fistula closed with silver wire and clamps, and decompressing the bladder with a catheter. Sims' pupil, Thomas Emmet, published their work in 1868, making one of the first substantive contributions to the medical literature regarding fistula surgery. 4

Nearly a century and a half later (2020) we continue to function in a field without robust surgical writing and evidence. Many gaps in our practice are due to the unique challenges associated with conducting the studies and work necessary in the settings and populations affected by obstetric fistula. Kelly and Winter 5 advocate for more clustered randomized controlled trials on obstetric fistula, specifically its treatment; however, they do acknowledge the difficulties in randomization. In addition, iatrogenic fistula seems to be on the rise in many countries where obstetric fistula is prevalent, leading to a need for more research into the prevention and treatment of these injuries as well. The aim of the present article is to review the most relevant current literature on surgical aspects of obstetric fistula, including a delineation of what is still unknown, highlighting the need for further investigations to contribute to refinement of our surgical practice.

### Wound repair and regeneration [^113yURQt]. Nature (2008). Excellent credibility.

The repair of wounds is one of the most complex biological processes that occur during human life. After an injury, multiple biological pathways immediately become activated and are synchronized to respond. In human adults, the wound repair process commonly leads to a non-functioning mass of fibrotic tissue known as a scar. By contrast, early in gestation, injured fetal tissues can be completely recreated, without fibrosis, in a process resembling regeneration. Some organisms, however, retain the ability to regenerate tissue throughout adult life. Knowledge gained from studying such organisms might help to unlock latent regenerative pathways in humans, which would change medical practice as much as the introduction of antibiotics did in the twentieth century.

### Repair of spinal cord injuries: where are we, where are we going? [^1143ucGx]. Spinal Cord (2002). Low credibility.

Repairing the spinal cord has for a long time been a 'holy grail' for neuroscientists. No achievement in neuroscience is more difficult to achieve, and none would have the same impact amongst the medical profession and the public. Yet no patient has yet benefited from a regeneration therapy. At last sufficient progress has been made in the basic science of axon regeneration that treatments that would partially repair a spinal injury are imminent. A full repair of spinal injury still remains elusive. This review summarises progress to date, and suggests ways in which progress towards treatment of spinal injury patients might be made.

### Comparison of hernia sac transection and full sac reduction for the treatment of inguinal hernias: a systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials [^1161ZNYw]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

The repair of an open hernia begins with the incision of the inguinal canal and the separation of the hernial sac from the spermatic cord. However, the subsequent course of action remains a subject of debate: many surgeons propose a straightforward removal of the sac (herniotomy), while others favor the invagination of the sac. High sac ligation proponents argue that this method is necessary to decrease the frequency of hernia recurrences. The procedure in question has been associated with avoidable postoperative pain, an increased incidence of postoperative ileus and hemorrhage at peritoneal incisions, and the potential for fibrotic adhesions between a peritoneal scar and the small intestine. The proposal of high ligation and excision of the indirect hernia sac as a crucial measure to decrease recurrences was initially put up by Edoardo Bassini. Today, however, the emphasis has changed from managing the sac to rectifying the abnormality. Laparoscopic hernia repairs have demonstrated a recent breakthrough by eliminating the need for sac ligation and instead inverting or excising the sac, resulting in similar rates of recurrence. The Shouldice procedure involves opening, inspecting, and either excising or inverting the indirect hernial sac without ligation in a no‐mesh pure tissue repair. Optional management strategies for the indirect hernial sac in the Shouldice technique had a lesser impact on recurrence compared to open mesh repairs. Rutkow cautioned against surgically accessing the hernia sac for visual examination. Furthermore, he proposed that by tying the sac, it may cause localized symptoms similar to peritoneal inflammation, as the sac is derived from the very sensitive peritoneum. Therefore, a significant portion of the postoperative discomfort and agony might be ascribed to this artificial peritonitis. Due to the lack of evidence supporting the potential improvement in the recurrence rate with high ligation, Rutkow's mesh plug repair avoids it. Similarly, in the Lichtenstein repair, the sac is inverted or removed instead of being ligated.

The primary aim of this systematic review and meta‐analysis is to examine the differences between hernia sac transection (with or without high ligation) and reduction (invagination) in children and adults who underwent suture repair and Lichtenstein open tension‐free inguinal hernia repair. Our hypothesis is that invagination offers notable benefits in terms of reducing postoperative pain without increasing the occurrence of recurrences, compared to hernia sac transection.

### Biologic vs synthetic mesh for single-stage repair of contaminated ventral hernias… [^113HT5Lt]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Meaning Synthetic mesh demonstrated significantly lower hernia recurrence risk than biologic mesh in patients undergoing single-stage repair of clean-contaminated and contaminated ventral hernias. Importance Biologic mesh is widely used for reinforcing contaminated ventral hernia repairs; however, it is expensive and has been associated with high rates of long-term hernia recurrence. Synthetic mesh is a lower-cost alternative but its efficacy has not been rigorously studied in individuals with contaminated hernias. Interventions Retromuscular synthetic or biologic mesh at the time of fascial closure. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was the superiority of synthetic mesh vs biologic mesh at reducing risk of hernia recurrence at 2 years based on intent-to-treat analysis. Secondary outcomes included mesh safety, defined as the rate of surgical site occurrence requiring a procedural intervention, and 30-day hospital direct costs and prosthetic costs.

All procedures were performed by 1 of 8 qualified general surgeons with fellowship training in advanced abdominal wall reconstruction. A retromuscular hernia repair was performed in all patients as previously described and complete details are available in the eMethods in Supplement 3.
13. Other secondary outcomes included postoperative adverse events, quality of life, and cost. Complete definitions are available in the eMethods in Supplement 3. Clinical evaluation was documented by the treating physician at a mean 1 days, 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months after surgery or additionally if complications or follow-up occurred. Consensus definitions and treatment plans for common surgical site occurrences following open complex ventral hernia repair were developed a priori for the purposes of this study protocol.

In terms of efficacy, synthetic mesh was associated with a significant absolute risk reduction of hernia recurrence at 2 years compared with biologic mesh. This is in keeping with prior work, 18, 19 and further supports the notion that synthetic mesh is a superior device for repair of contaminated ventral hernias. Although medium- to long-term recurrence rates after incisional hernia repair with mesh are considered somewhat common and range from 20% to 70% in surgical literature, 23, 24 these recurrences are far from benign with regard to their ultimate impact on patient well-being and health care resource utilization.

### TEP or TAPP for recurrent inguinal hernia repair-register-based comparison of the outcome [^112KCD14]. Surgical Endoscopy (2017). Low credibility.

Patients and methods

The Herniamed Registry is a multicenter, internet-based hernia registry (20) into which 427 participating hospitals and surgeons engaged in private practice (Herniamed Study Group) have entered data prospectively on their patients who had undergone hernia surgery. All postoperative complications occurring up to 30 days after surgery are recorded. On one-year follow-up, postoperative complications are once again reviewed when the general practitioner and patient complete a questionnaire. They are also asked about any re-recurrence, pain at rest, and on exertion as well as pain requiring treatment. This present analysis compares the prospective data collected for all male patients with a minimum age of 16 years who had undergone elective recurrent unilateral inguinal hernia repair using either transabdominal preperitoneal patch plasty (TAPP) or total extraperitoneal patch plasty (TEP).

In total, 2,246 patients were enrolled between September 1, 2009, and August 31, 2013 (Fig. 1). Of these patients, 782 (34.8%) had TEP and 1,464 (65.2%) TAPP repair. All the patients had to have one-year follow-up data available (follow-up-rate: 100%).

Fig. 1
Flowchart of patient inclusion

The majority of primary unilateral repairs in the Herniamed Registry have been performed as open mesh repair (Lichtenstein) with 32.5% and laparo-endoscopic mesh repair (TAPP, TEP) with 49.9%. Non-mesh repairs (Shouldice, Bassini) in primary unilateral inguinal hernia repair in the Herniamed Registry make only a contribution of 4.7% of all cases.

Arthur Sidney Blundell Bankart was a London-based orthopedic surgeon who discovered the essential lesion in recurrent anterior shoulder instability in 1923. He pioneered a technique, the Bankart repair, to re-establish stability to the glenohumeral joint, without sacrificing native joint motion. In this article, the original Bankart repair is compared to the modern arthroscopic Bankart repair, accompanied by a surgical video of Blundell Bankart performing the Bankart repair in 1951, shortly before his death. Bankart's original description included an open repair with a coracoid osteotomy and subscapularis tenotomy and repair. The history of the technique, its utility in present day, and the future of the Bankart repair are discussed.

### Commentary: suture annuloplasty for isolated aortic valve repair: the holy grail is yet to be found [^111jEgTo]. JTCVS Techniques (2021). Medium credibility.

François Dagenais, MD

Central Message

Although significant milestones have been achieved in aortic valve reconstruction, the ideal annuloplasty technique in isolated aortic valve repair remains to be defined.

See Article page.

In their article in this issue of the Journal, Federspiel and colleaguesreview current techniques for suture annuloplasty during isolated aortic valve repair. Since the initial descriptions of the reimplantation/remodeling techniques by David and Yacoub, significant milestones have been achieved in the field of aortic valve repair for aortic regurgitation. Although initially viewed as more "art" than "science", significant contributions have led to a better understanding of the concepts of aortic valve repair. Foremost, as elegantly illustrated in the present report, thorough knowledge of the normal anatomy and physiology linked to aortic valve competency is essential. Efforts at standardizing procedures according to different root anatomies have led to a more comprehensive approach to the procedures, and hence better reproducibility. Finally, early echocardiographic findings, such as residual aortic regurgitation and effective leaflet height, have been identified as strong predictors of procedural outcome.

### Commentary: never let the truth get in the way of a good story [^112Kcy1c]. JTCVS Techniques (2020). Medium credibility.

The issue of whether or not to proceed with a primary neonatal cone repair versus initial single ventricle Starnes procedure followed by cone repair is also unresolved. Although neonatal cone repair might be technically feasible, Ebstein's anomaly involves the right ventricle as well, and the dysfunctional right ventricle might not be able to generate sufficient pressure to open the pulmonary valve in neonates with severe Ebstein's anomaly, favoring initial single ventricle palliation. The criteria for selecting candidates for primary neonatal repair or for eventual biventricular repair remain to be determined and are likely linked to clinical presentation, heart morphology, and institutional experience and philosophy towards this complex disease. This report of a staged approach offers a valid strategy in neonates with significant heart failure as a result of severe Ebstein's anomaly.

Although adding another treatment strategy for a difficult problem to the surgeon's armamentarium is a cause for celebration, unfortunately, the reality is less appealing. First, there are substantial variances in the management strategies of neonates with severe Ebstein's anomaly: some centers (eg, Toronto, Melbourne) have reported successful conservative medical management in the majority of patients. When intervention is necessary, some centers are more likely to implement a single ventricle palliation strategy (eg, Los Angeles, Michigan), whereas a few applied primary biventricular repair in the majority of patients (eg, Memphis, Osaka, Taipei). These variations again highlight the differences in experience and approach to this complex disease and the knowledge gap that exists, prohibiting a consensus uniform tactic for managing these complicated neonates. Second, operative mortality following the diverse treatment strategies of neonatal Ebstein's anomaly continues to be higher than desired. One of the many contributions of Dr Vaughn Starnes to our field include the single ventricle right ventricular exclusion principle that provided improved survival in these patients; however, mortality continues to be among the highest in our specialty: 5 of 27 (19%) in the experience from Los Angeles (only 13% with patch fenestration). Similarly, reported mortality following neonatal tricuspid valve repair for Ebstein's anomaly is high, up to 75%; in the experience of Dr Knott-Craig from Memphis, mortality was 28%, although it was lower in those without pulmonary atresia and those with pulmonary atresia who underwent a right ventricle–to–pulmonary artery conduit. In a recent review of the Society of Thoracic Surgeons database, tricuspid valve repair was the most common neonatal intervention (40%; mortality, 34%), followed by aortopulmonary shunt (20%; mortality, 17%) and the Starnes procedure (9%; mortality, 25%); again highlighting variations in strategies and continuous high mortality.

### Groin hernia repair: open techniques [^116wVVHo]. World Journal of Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Since the introduction of the Bassini method in 1887, more than 70 types of pure tissue repair have been reported in the surgical literature. An unacceptable recurrence rate and prolonged postoperative pain and recovery time after tissue repair along with our understanding of the metabolic origin of inguinal hernias led to the concept of tension-free hernioplasty with mesh. Currently, the main categories of inguinal hernia repair are the open repairs and the laparoscopic repairs. In the open category, repair of the hernia is achieved by pure tissue approximation or by tension-free mesh repair. The most commonly performed tissue repairs are those of Bassini, Shouldice, and to a lesser extent McVay. In the tension-free mesh repair category, the mesh is placed in front of the transversalis fascia, such as with the Lichtenstein tension-free hernioplasty, or behind the transversalis fascia in the preperitoneal space, such as during the Nyhus, Rives, Read, Stoppa, Wantz, and Kugel procedures. Numerous comparative randomized trials have clearly demonstrated the superiority of the tension-free mesh repair over the traditional tissue approximation method. Placing mesh behind the transversalis fascia, although a sound concept, requires extensive dissection in the highly complex preperitoneal space and can lead to injury of the pelvic structures, major hematoma formation, or both. In addition, according to the prospective randomized comparative study of mesh placement in front of versus behind the transversalis fascia, the latter offers no advantage over the former, and it is more difficult to perform, learn, and teach. More importantly, preperitoneal mesh implantation (via open and laparoscopic procedure) leads to obliteration of the spaces of Retzius and Bogros, making certain vascular and urologic procedures, in particular radical prostatectomy and lymph node dissection, extremely difficult if not impossible. In conclusion, according to level A evidence from randomized comparative studies, (1) mesh repair is superior to pure tissue approximation repairs, and (2) mesh implantation in front of the transversalis fascia is superior, safer, and easier than open or laparoscopic mesh implantation behind the transversalis fascia.

Is there any role for intraperitoneal onlay mesh in inguinal hernia repair?

Search Items: "IPOM"; "Intraperitoneal onlay Mesh"; "Inguinal hernia" AND "Intraperitoneal" AND "Onlay" AND "mesh"

Statements

Recommendations

Inguinal herniorrhaphy has been evolving since it was first described by Bassini. Lichtenstein popularized tension-free repair with mesh. Laparoscopy arrived on the scene in late 1980s and has further revolutionized the surgical techniques. It is well accepted that laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) and totally extraperitoneal (TEP) repairs have comparable recurrence rates and acceptable morbidity and mortality. Both techniques are challenging and have steep learning curves.

The IPOM technique was first introduced in 1991 as a way to reduce or eliminate the difficulty and potential complications of preperitoneal dissection and still maintain the tension free concept [21]. It also is perceived to be faster and easier to perform and teach. The simplicity and reduced operative times are the main attraction of this technique.

Unfortunately, there are not many prospective randomized studies with long-term results. There are three randomized trial (1B) [1–4] and one nonrandomized feasibility study [5] to evaluate IPOM technique. There also are 16 Level 4 case series [6–21].

A study by Vogt et al. [2] initially showed very good results at 8 months. The recurrence rate for IPOM was 3% compared with 7% for open suture repair. Long-term data were then published by Kingsley et al. [1]. The recurrence rate at 41 months was 43% for IPOM and 15% for open suture repair! This really stresses the importance of long-term follow-up. The IPOM technique was performed with ePTFE mesh (10 × 15 cm²) fenestrated to 1:1.5. Cooper's ligament was exposed through a small opening and mesh was secured to Cooper's, the iliopubic tract, and transversus abdominus with EMS Ethicon hernia stapler. The operative times were 62.5 min for IPOM and 80.9 min for the open group.

### Desarda versus lichtenstein technique for primary inguinal hernia treatment: 3-year results of a randomized clinical trial [^114dn3Gh]. World Journal of Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

The percentage of other early and late complications was comparable. The higher ratio of seromas after use of the Lichtenstein method can be explained by the influence of the synthetic mesh on surrounding tissues. This is consistent with other studies and the known influence of polypropylene on tissue. Foreign body sensation and abdominal wall stiffness were expressed by 12 to 16% of the Desarda group patients and 17 to 22% of the Lichtenstein group patients at different time points, and the results are within the range (4.5–43.8%) reported by other authors for mesh techniques. Surprisingly, these mesh-related sensations were experienced similarly by patients from both groups and did not change even after the participants were informed of the technique used after 2 years of follow-up.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a randomized clinical trial comparing the Desarda and Lichtenstein techniques. Previously, Mitura and Romanczuk have published the results of a 6-month follow-up study of the Desarda and Lichtenstein approaches. They observed no recurrence, and pain after 6 months was comparable in the two groups (VAS scores were 8 vs. 11 in the Desarda and Lichtenstein groups, respectively; p = 0.691). Situma et al. presented their short-term results of Desarda versus modified Bassini inguinal hernia repair, concluding that there was no difference between these two techniques in regard to pain and return to normal activity. Other results, published by Desarda and his group, were based on a comparison of his technique and the Lichtenstein technique. They reported no recurrence among the 269 Desarda group patients and 1.97% recurrence among the 225 mesh group patients; 6.49% of patients from the mesh group and no patients in the Desarda group reported chronic pain at 1 year after surgery. In our opinion, despite some methodologic inadequacies in the presented articles, the Desarda method merits more attention and further investigation by other authors.

### Management of recurrent inguinal hernia at a tertiary care hospital of Southern sindh, Pakistan [^111YKcRQ]. World Journal of Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The goal of the present study was to determine the frequency, mode of presentation, and need for reoperation in the treatment of recurrent inguinal hernia at Liaquat University Hospital, Jamshoro, Sindh, Pakistan.

Methods

This descriptive, cross-sectional study was conducted over a period of four years, from January 2007 through December 2010. A total of 916 patients with inguinal hernia underwent operation in the Department of Surgery at Liaquat University Hospital Jamshoro, Sindh, Pakistan, during the study period. Of them, 62 patients were diagnosed to have recurrent inguinal hernia and were included in the study. Female patients and patients with other types of hernia like femoral, epigastric, and paraumbilical defects were excluded.

Results

Among the 62 patients studied, the commonest age group with recurrence was 41–50 years (43.5%). Fifty-one (82.2%) of the patients were ambulatory workers. In 47 cases (75.8%) recurrence was on the right side, and in 15 (24.1%) recurrence was on the left side. First time recurrence was seen in 54 patients (87%) and second time recurrence was seen in 7 patients (11.2%); third time recurrence was observed in only one patient. All of these patients had an initial open surgery without mesh, except one. Bassini's repair was done as a primary repair in 47 (75.8%) cases. A total of 11 patients (17.7%) had no previous medical records. Darning repair was done in 3 patients (4.8%), and open surgery with mesh was performed in only one patient. The highest recurrence rates were seen in patients whose hernia repairs had been done by postgraduate trainees. That is, 45 of the patients requiring reoperation (72.5%), compared to 11 (17.7%), and 6 (9.6%) operations performed by registrars and consultants, respectively. All patients in our study underwent tension-free Lichtenstein mesh repair. Postoperative complications included retention of urine (40.3%), scrotal hematoma (6.4%), and wound infection (3.2%).

Conclusions

Recurrent inguinal hernia is still frequently observed today, and the Lichtenstein tension-free repair has gained great acceptance worldwide and is currently considered the procedure of choice for primary and recurrent inguinal hernias.

### Frequency and complications of inguinal hernia repair in giant omphalocele [^117Rqbqk]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

Giant omphalocele (GO) is a challenging problem owing to aberrant anatomy and complex comorbidities. Large inguinal hernias (IH) are known to occur in this population, but have not been well described in the literature. We sought to characterize rates and complications of IH in GO patients.

Methods

A retrospective chart review was performed on all patients with the diagnosis of GO from 2004 to 2012, with a minimum follow-up period of 12 months. Statistical significance was calculated using Fisher's exact test and Mann-Whitney test (p < 0.05).

Results

A total of 51 giant omphalocele patients were born during the 8-year study period, with IH diagnosed in 21 patients (41%). IH was not associated with gestational age, birth weight, or method of GO closure, but was significantly associated with male gender (p < 0.0001). Incarceration occurred in 4 patients (19%). Recurrence was noted in 7 cases, with 6/7 recurrences following repair by high ligation of the sac alone. All recurrences were repaired with the Bassini repair. Postoperative complications were noted in 7 patients (33%) and included prolonged ileus following incarceration, testicular tethering, testicular atrophy, persistent hydrocele, and death following acute incarceration.

Conclusions

Our study suggests a high incidence of IH in GO patients. The prevalance of incarceration and recurrences in these patients support a role for inguinal herniorrhaphy via a Bassini repair prior to initial hospital discharge.

### Are immunosuppressive conditions and preoperative corticosteroid treatment risk factors in inguinal hernia repair? [^116dnNBb]. Surgical Endoscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Immunosuppressive conditions and/or preoperative corticosteroid treatment have a negative influence on wound healing and can, therefore, lead to higher rates of surgical site infections (SSIs) and seromas. For inguinal hernia, no such studies have been carried out to date.

Methods

In an analysis of data from the Herniamed Registry, 2312 of 142,488 (1.6%) patients with primary unilateral inguinal hernia repair had an anamnestic history of an immunosuppressive condition and/or preoperative corticosteroid treatment. Using propensity score matching, 2297 (99.4%) pairs with comparative patient characteristics were formed. These were then compared using the following primary outcome criteria: intra- and postoperative complications, complication-related reoperations, recurrence at one-year follow-up, pain on exertion, pain at rest, and chronic pain requiring treatment at one-year follow-up. Of the 2297 matched pairs with primary unilateral inguinal hernia repair, 82.76% were male patients. 1010 (44.0%) were operated in laparo-endoscopic techniques (TEP, TAPP), 1225 (53.3%) in open techniques (Bassini, Shouldice, Lichtenstein, Plug, TIP, Gilbert, Desarda), and 62 (2.7%) in other techniques.

Results

The matched pair analysis results did not identify any disadvantage in terms of the outcome criteria for patients with an anamnestic history of immunosuppressive condition and/or preoperative corticosteroid treatment (yes vs no). In particular, no disadvantage was noted in the rate of surgical site infections (0.65% vs 0.70%; ns) or seromas (1.22% vs 1.57%; ns). The overall rates of postoperative complications were 3.40% vs 4.31% (p = ns) (plus 0.22% concordant events in five matched pairs).

Conclusion

In primary unilateral inguinal hernia surgery, an immunosuppressive condition and/or preoperative corticosteroid treatment does not appear to have a negative influence on wound complications.

### Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair in 2019: linked, double row repair for achieving higher healing rates and optimal clinical outcomes [^113Dgwfb]. Arthroscopy (2019). Medium credibility.

The primary aim of rotator cuff repair surgery is to restore the musculotendinous units by creating a complete, tension-free repair construct that optimizes conditions for tendon-to-bone healing. There are many factors outside the control of the surgeon that are capable of affecting the healing process; however, there are also a number of important technical considerations that the surgeon can control, including familiarity with methods to deal with immobile tissues and techniques to perform novel repair constructs. It is clear that linked double row repairs are more likely to heal, and healed rotator cuff repairs best restore shoulder strength, improve patients' satisfaction, and maximize functional outcomes.

### Management of rotator cuff injuries [^115gtm1S]. AAOS (2025). High credibility.

High-grade partial-thickness rotator cuff tears — Conversion to full-thickness or transtendinous/in-situ repair can be performed in patients that failed conservative management with high-grade partial-thickness rotator cuff tears, with Quality of Evidence: High and Strength of Recommendation: Strong. The rationale cites two high quality studies and two moderate quality studies, while the remainder of published studies either had too few subjects (< 20) or were low quality Level IV studies. Across comparative studies, Kim 2015 noted no difference in either clinical outcomes or re-tear rates comparing transtendinous rotator cuff (RC) repair versus tear completion with RC repair; bursal side cuff tears had a higher retear rate with either technique; Shin, 2012 noted a significantly faster recovery with tear completion and reported retears were higher in the tear completion group but did not reach statistical significance. Castagna 2015 looked at a total of 74 patients randomized to transtendinous repair versus tear completion with repair and found no significant differences between the two groups, and Franceschi 2013 reported that outcomes and retear rates were comparable between transtendinous repair and tear completion with repair. Future research notes that additional high-quality Level I studies with longer follow-up would be helpful in determining the longevity of these procedures, as well as establishing the risk of retears.

### Flexor tendon repairs: techniques, eponyms, and evidence [^114vsvkf]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

The evolution in surgical technique and suture technology has provided an abundance of options for flexor tendon repairs. Multiple biomechanical studies have attempted to identify the best surgical technique based on suture properties, technical modifications, and repair configurations. However, the burgeoning amount of research on flexor tendon repairs has made it difficult to follow, and no gold standard has been determined for the optimal repair algorithm. Therefore, it seems that repairs are usually chosen based on a combination of familiarity from training, popularity, and technical difficulty. We will discuss the advantages, disadvantages, and technical aspects of some of the most common core flexor tendon repairs in the literature. We will also highlight the nomenclature carried through the years, drawings of the repairs referred to by that nomenclature, and the data that support those repairs.

An 89-year-old man presented to the surgical assessment unit with a 1-week history of progressively worsening abdominal pain, fever and a tender mass in the right iliac fossa. A diagnosis of strangulated inguinal hernia was made. Intraoperatively, a perforated appendix and a pus-filled sac were found. An appendicectomy and a Bassini repair of the hernia were performed with a satisfactory postoperative outcome. In the majority of cases Amyand's hernia is an intraoperative finding and its management depends on the extent of appediceal disease. In cases of perforated appendix with periappendiceal abscess within the hernial sac, an appedicectomy with Bassini's repair is recommended.

### Femoral hernia repair [^1175JPXj]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Femoral hernia repair has a long history. In the nineteenth century, simple closure of the femoral orifice by the femoral approach was favored. Such renowned surgeons as Bassini, Marcy, and Cushing authored papers about the femoral approach to femoral hernia. The recurrence rate was so high, however, that it was replaced by the inguinal approach. The man who popularized the inguinal approach was Chester McVay, who demonstrated the precise insertion of the tranversus abdominis muscle and transversalis fascia to the Cooper's ligament. He used Cooper's ligament for the femoral hernia repair by the inguinal approach. The complication and recurrence rate after the Cooper's ligament repair for femoral hernia was not satisfactory, however, due to tension on the approximated tissues, which caused postoperative pain and inability to resume normal activities. Irving Lichtenstein first introduced the plug technique to femoral hernia repair and it was further developed by Gilbert and Rutkow. In the present series, all elective cases were repaired by the PerFix mesh plug technique without any complications. Patients were discharged from the hospital on the first postoperative day and returned to normal activities shortly thereafter. These patients had few complaints of pain in the groin. The operating time using a PerFix plug was markedly shorter when contrasted with the Cooper's ligament repair. No infection of the prosthesis occurred, even in the cases in which the small intestine was necrotic and resected. From our 7-year experience of mesh plug femoral hernia repairs, I have come to regard this operation as the first choice in elective and noninfected cases of femoral hernia. In strangulated cases in which severe infection occurs. Cooper's ligament repair should be used, because there is a risk or infection to implanted prosthesis. Finally, femoral hernia is usually thought of as requiring emergency surgical treatment. Only 30% of our cases were treated as emergency operations, however, whereas 70% were elective. Unless patients complain of severe abdominal pain or ileus, surgeons need not perform emergency operations. In summary, the PerFix mesh plug hernia repair for femoral hernia has resulted in a reduced recurrence rate, shortened hospital stay, and a low rate of postoperative complications.

Figure 4
Clockwise leaflet rotation and approximation of the mobilized anterior/inferior leaflet to the proximal mobilized edge of the septal leaflet.

In situations in which the septal leaflet is absent, the anterior leaflet is completely detached at the anteroseptal commissure. Side-to-side connections are performed between all available segments of mobilized leaflet tissue, making a true "cone" with no commissures present. In this situation, it is important to ensure that the distal orifice of the cone is of adequate size to avoid tricuspid stenosis, which is more likely to occur when there is insufficient leaflet tissue to create a good-sized cone or when there is no commissure(s) present.

After the cone reconstruction is completed, the atrialized RV is examined to determine whether plication is necessary. Atrialization typically occurs along the inferior wall of the RV; it is smooth and non-trabeculated and the line of demarcation with normal trabeculated RV muscle is clear. The technique for internal plication of the atrialized RV includes the following: monofilament suture (5–0 in children; 4–0 in adults) is used and the suture line is begun distally, ie, closest to the RV apex (Figure 5). Suture bites are confined to the endocardium to avoid a coronary compromise from sutures exiting onto the epicardial surface and distorting/ligating acute marginal branches of the right coronary artery. It is important to periodically examine the exterior surface of the RV to ensure that inadvertent compromise of coronary branches has been avoided. The plication suture line is advanced toward the base of the heart, ie, toward the atrioventricular groove and extends across the annulus and into the right atrium. As the dotted lines of the base of the triangle are effectively approximated (Figure 5), the atrialized RV is excluded, reducing the size of the RV and the true annulus so it is closer in size to the smaller neotricuspid orifice. It should be emphasized that the plication suture line be confined to the atrialized segment of the inferior wall of the RV; specifically, it is important that the suture line does not inadvertently drift onto the ventricular septum (which is also smooth with minimal trabeculations), since the posterior descending coronary artery is very vulnerable to injury at this junction of the RV free wall and ventricular septum. As the suture line crosses the AV groove, it is essential to avoid deep bites that could also compromise the distal main right coronary artery (Figure 6). After the corners of the base of the triangle are approximated to eliminate the "blind pouch" into the excluded segment of inferior wall, a second suture line is completed so dehiscence is avoided.

### Is the lichtenstein operation of strangulated groin hernia a safe procedure? [^114GPq9T]. World Journal of Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Background

In spite of many published articles describing the hernia repairs, there are only a few original reports concerning the polymer mesh application during emergency procedures for strangulated inguinal hernias. The aim of our study was to evaluate the results of the Lichtenstein and Bassini operations for strangulated groin hernias and to show the changing number of the tension-free repairs.

Methods

From 1997 to 2004, the Bassini procedure was performed in 21 patients, 6 of whom underwent small intestine resection and 2 others required resection of the necrotic omentum. The strangulated intestinal loop or omentum were released in 13 cases. After the repair 1 patient died of shock caused by intestinal necrosis. Of 56 patients who underwent an emergency Lichtenstein procedure, 55 were followed-up. A small intestine resection was performed in 2 cases to correct segmental necrosis. The gangrenous omental appendix of the sigmoid colon was excised in 1 patient, and necrotic omental fragments were resected in 2 cases. The strangulated intestinal loop or omentum was released in 51 patients. All patients were given wide-spectrum antibiotics intravenously.

Results

Between 1997 and 2000 tension-free procedures were performed in half of the patients undergoing emergency operation for strangulated hernia; between 2001 and 2004 such procedures were employed in more than 90% of the cases. In 2 patients we observed a small inflammatory infiltration of the wound that resolved within several days after Lichtenstein repair. A serous fluid collection was present in 2 cases. The treatment consisted of puncture and was successful in both cases.

Conclusions

The use of monofilament polypropylene mesh for strangulated inguinal hernia repair is safe, and the risk of the local infectious complications is low.

### Inguinal hernia surgery learning curves by associate clinicians [^114dZktL]. Surgical Endoscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Sample size estimation

A sample size calculation was performed, and a minimum of 128 operations in each cohort were needed, resulting in a sample size of at least 26 trainees to detect a difference in mean operating time of five minutes (difference to detect) between subsequent cohorts with a power of 80 percent. The standardized difference was calculated by dividing the 'difference to detect' by the 'standard deviation' (SD). The estimated SD (20 min) was a derivative from learning curve studies by Miyazaki et al. and Harjai et al. both reporting on operating times of the Lichtenstein tension-free mesh inguinal hernia repair. As the Lichtenstein and Bassini procedures are both open inguinal hernia repairs of which operating times are considered rather similar, the number of herniorrhaphies included per surgical trainee was based on an analysis of the learning curve of the Lichtenstein. In order not to miss the inflection point at which there is no further significant reduction in operating time, the primary outcomes were evaluated on the means of the first 55 herniorrhaphies. This corresponded to 1.5 times the number of corrected open hernias with mesh, before the inflection point was reached. To assess if the established learning curve was representative for all trainees, a sub-analysis was performed also including the trainees who left the training program prematurely due to insufficient progress, or for personal reasons and thereby failed to perform the required minimum of 55 herniorrhaphies. The sub-analysis on operating times was identically performed as for the group with ≥ 55 herniorrhaphies.

Data management

Trainees kept record of operation specific data in paper-based logbooks and after each surgery, procedures were checked and signed by the supervising surgeon. The logbook data were transferred to excel and uploaded to an online server hosted by CapaCare and for this study transferred to protected servers hosted by Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands. Data were checked for missing values and typing errors, and cleaned for duplicates. Logbook data from trainees was excluded from analysis, when ≥ 3 operating times among the first 55 herniorrhaphies were missing. All changes were logged.

### BAP1 as a guardian of genome stability: implications in human cancer [^112RNUt5]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Unsolved problems and potential directions for future research

In addition to the mechanisms underlying BAP1 damage-site recruitment, the way in which BAP1 promotes DSB repair remains largely unknown. Several mechanisms might provide some answers. Since BAP1 is required for the accumulation of BRCA1, RAD51 and RPA at damage sites, BAP1 may facilitate DSB repair by recruiting these factors directly via protein-protein interactions. This mechanism is plausible, at least for BRCA1, given that BAP1 directly interacts with this repair protein. The RING domain of BRCA1, which engages in E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, is important for its HR-promoting activity. Thus, BAP1 may promote DSB repair by regulating the deubiquitination of BRCA1 substrates and even BRCA1 itself. H2Aub is important for the RNF8/RNF168-mediated ubiquitin signaling cascade that leads to the recruitment of repair factors, including BRCA1. PRC1-mediated H2A ubiquitination facilitates DSB repair by blocking the transcription of regions adjacent to the damage site. Therefore, BAP1 may contribute to DNA repair by regulating H2Aub levels at damage sites. This scenario is possible because H2Aub levels at a DSB are inversely correlated with BAP1 recruitment, and BAP1 depletion increases H2Aub accumulation at a DSB(Fig. 1). However, given the general consensus that BAP1-mediated H2A deubiquitination activates transcription, how BAP1 promotes HR repair via H2Aub regulation remains unclear. BAP1 might regulate H2Aub abundance at chromatin surrounding damage sites to achieve an optimal balance between the activities of DNA repair and transcription. Alternatively, BAP1 might differentially affect DNA repair at transcriptionally active or inactive and intergenic regions. Another plausible explanation suggests that BAP1 might facilitate the whole repair process by promoting transcription recovery after activation and/or completion of DNA repair. In addition, the exact role of BAP1 phosphorylation in DSB repair remains unknown and certainly needs to be clarified. Moreover, given the recent findings that PARP1 recruits BAP1 to damage sites and regulates BAP1 activity during UV-induced DNA damage repair (see below), determining whether PARP1 shows similar activity in DSB repair is worthy of further investigation (Fig. 1). Finally, since studies have indicated that BAP1 regulates the expression of genes encoding DDR proteins, an indirect contribution by BAP1 to DSB repair via regulated gene expression cannot be ruled out. Resolving all these issues, together with efforts to identify potential new BAP1 targets, will provide a better understanding of how BAP1 promotes DSB repair.

### Lightweight versus heavyweight synthetic mesh for inguinal hernia repair [^114KfifS]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Criteria for considering studies for this review

Types of studies

We will include parallel‐arm randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing synthetic LWM versus synthetic HWM without restrictions on publication status or language. We will not include quasi‐RCTs (e.g. randomised on the basis of date of birth, participant's registration number, or the order in which participants were recruited) or cross‐over or cluster‐RCTs. We will include studies irrespective of their publication status, unless exclusion is explicitly justified. We will include unpublished data if shared by study authors and will perform a sensitivity analysis to check the effect of excluding such studies on the main analysis.

Types of participants

We will include all adult participants (aged 18 and over) with an inguinal hernia undergoing elective inguinal hernia repair with prosthetic mesh placement. We will include studies with a paediatric population (aged less than 18 years) if > 90% of participants are adults, even if the data on the adult population cannot be extracted separately.

Types of interventions

Types of inguinal hernia repair

Open techniques will include any open synthetic mesh‐reinforced repair.
Laparoscopic techniques will include: TAPP; TEP; robotic TAPP.

We will consider open synthetic mesh‐reinforced repair (e.g. Lichtenstein repair) and laparo‐endoscopic technique for elective surgical repair of an uncomplicated inguinal hernia with the use of prosthetic mesh (lightweight and heavyweight).

Types of synthetic mesh

We will include lightweight mesh (non‐absorbable polypropylene; absorbable poliglecaprone or polyglactin) of < 50 g/m² and heavyweight mesh (non‐absorbable polypropylene) of > 70 g/m² as cut‐off points (Currie 2012; Klinge 2012; Melkemichel 2018; Stabilini 2023; Zhu 2015).

We will exclude studies reporting usage of mesh weight between 50 g/m² and 70 g/m². We will exclude studies reporting the usage of mesh in an emergency setting or complicated hernia.

### Laparoscopic repair of inguinal hernias [^113Zkn9A]. World Journal of Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Recurrent hernias

Outcomes for repair of recurrent inguinal hernia have been evaluated in several large-scale studies. The largest of these was a Danish study of hernia registry patients with recurrence after Lichtenstein repair. The operative re-recurrence rate was 11.3% when a second Lichtenstein repair was performed, but only 1.3% when a laparoscopic repair was performed. The laparoscopic approach was better whether the original repair technique was a tissue-only repair (including Bassini, McVay, and Shouldice repairs), an anterior non-Lichtenstein repair with mesh, or even a primary laparoscopic repair.

Other prospective randomized trials have shown that the laparoscopic approach is better for recurrent hernias. One study randomized 147 patients with recurrent inguinal hernia to either open Lichtenstein or laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) repair. The study reported less postoperative pain and fewer days for sick leave with TAPP. Recurrence rates were similar. A second randomized comparison in 235 patients showed fewer complications (4.4% vs. 12.2%) and fewer recurrences (2.2% vs. 5.7%) with the laparoscopic approach. A third study randomized 99 patients with recurrent inguinal hernia to either open Lichtenstein or totally extraperitoneal preperitoneal (TEP) laparoscopic repair and showed less chronic pain, earlier return to work, and a trend toward fewer recurrences (0 vs. 3). Finally, in subset analysis of the Veterans Affairs Cooperative Trial, 9.3% of participants enrolled with recurrent hernia. The 2-year re-recurrence rate was 10% in the laparoscopic group, which was identical to the recurrence rate for primary laparoscopic repairs. By comparison, the re-recurrence rate was 14% in the open group, more than three times the recurrence rate (4%) observed for primary open repairs.

### Amyand hernia: considerations for operative approach and surgical repair [^115X3UcH]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2020). Medium credibility.

What we did and why

Open hernia reduction, appendectomy and primary tissue repair

Amyand hernia is a rare type of inguinal hernia in which the appendix is contained within the hernia sac. It accounts for approximately 1% of inguinal hernias and is complicated by acute appendicitis in 0.08%–0.13% of the time.

This patient's leukocytosis and CT abdomen/pelvis showing a dilated appendix with fat stranding was consistent with an amyand hernia complicated by acute appendicitis without rupture. We initially performed diagnostic laparoscopy and attempted reduction of the appendix into the abdominal cavity with a laparoscopic approach. Our plan was to perform a laparoscopic appendectomy followed by a tissue repair of the inguinal hernia. We attempted to reduce the hernia with gentle retraction from within the abdomen and with external compression without success.

We then converted to an open approach with a transverse incision between the pubic symphysis to the anterior iliac spine. The external inguinal ring was exposed with an obvious hernia sac containing bowel. The hernia sac was dissected away from the cord structure, which on entry revealed an ischemic and inflamed appendix (figure 2). The incarcerated appendix and part of cecum was found to be viable without evidence of perforation. We pulled the cecum through the hernia and performed our open appendectomy through the inguinal incision (figure 3). The mucosal base of the appendix was cauterized, and we ensured the cecum was freed from surrounding attachments before placing the bowel back into the abdomen. Finally, we performed a primary tissue Bassini hernia repair. The patient was doing well with no hernia recurrence during a postoperative visit 3 weeks later.

### Surgical approaches for core abdominal injuries: a review of the abdominal core health quality collaborative database [^116vNPya]. Surgical Endoscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Core abdominal injury (CAI) is a broad term that describes injuries resulting from repetitive loading of the pubis that leads to inflammation, rupture, or destabilization of the core muscles from the pubic bone. There is no clear recommendation on the surgical approach to CAI. We aimed to describe how hernia surgeons within the Abdominal Core Health Quality Collaborative (ACHQC) address this problem surgically and the short-term outcomes.

Methods

We queried the ACHQC registry for patients undergoing surgery for isolated CAI and concomitant inguinal hernias (IH) and CAI. Operative approach and quality of life (using EuraHS survey scores) was abstracted.

Results

A total of 29,451 patients underwent surgery for IHs, CAIs, or both within the registry. Twenty patients underwent surgery for isolated CAI (median age 29, 90% males). Eleven patients (55%) underwent surgery with mesh (four Lichtenstein, three TAPP, and four TEP). Nine patients (45%) underwent tissue-based repairs (four closure of floor, one Bassini, one McVay, one Shouldice, one femoral exploration, and one laparoscopic-to-open conversion). There were no postoperative complications or reoperations within 30 days. EuraHS scores showed improvement at 30 days from baseline (median 29 [6.75–41.75] from 42 [29.42–57.61]). Sixty patients had both IHs and CAIs (median age 31, 97% males). All patients received mesh. Thirty-one patients (52%) underwent open surgery (23 Lichtenstein, 1 plug, 7 TREPP) and 29 underwent minimally invasive repairs (23 TAPP, 6 TEP). There was one seroma at 30 days. EuraHS scores showed improvement at 30 days from baseline (median 16 [5.17–27.33] from 37.5 [26.44–46.58]).

Conclusions

Despite technical variability, CAIs with or without concomitant IH generally undergo operations commonly used for IH repairs. Within our series, there was inconsistency with approach and mesh placement. Future work should be focused on standardizing the approach to CAI and capturing long-term data within the ACHQC.

Question 9: What is the Role of Injectable Biologics in Surgical Augmentation?

Injectable biologics are substances that may potentially enhance the healing and regeneration of tissues, such as bone, cartilage, ligament, tendon, and meniscus, in orthopedic surgery. Injectable biologics can be applied during or after surgery, either alone or in combination with other materials, such as scaffolds, implants, or grafts, which may have benefits such as improved healing rates and lower re-tear rates in various orthopedic surgeries. PRP, PRF, and cell-based therapies have been used to augment rotator cuff repair, Achilles tendon repair, anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, meniscal repair, and cartilage repair, with variable effects on clinical outcomes, healing rates, and re-tear rates. Growth factors have been used to enhance bone grafts, cartilage repair, and tendon-bone healing, with promising results from preclinical studies, but limited evidence from clinical trials.

### Primary umbilical hernia repair: does suture type matter? [^1126SFji]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Umbilical hernias are extremely common, estimated to be prevalent in 23–50 percent of people. They account for approximately 6% to 14% of all abdominal wall hernias in adults. 90% of adult umbilical hernias are acquired due to increased intra-abdominal pressure from obesity, ascites, pregnancy, or chronic cough. Surgical repair of umbilical hernias is recommended for worsening pain, increase in size, and/or bowel obstructive symptoms. Primary suture repair is the general recommendation for small umbilical hernias, specifically those two centimeters or less in size. However, the risk of hernia recurrence with primary umbilical repair is not insignificant, estimated to be anywhere from 4.9 to 27 percent. The rate of recurrence appears to be related to the dimensions of the hernia, with smaller defects tending to have lower recurrence rate following repair.

Currently, there is little literature to support what suture type will provide the best repair with lowest recurrence risk for primary umbilical hernias. There are a myriad of suture types used for repair. Most commonly used sutures include monofilament absorbable (polydioxanone suture (PDS)), monofilament permanent (Prolene), and braided (Ethibond) suture. Several studies have been conducted to determine which suture is best to use when closing the abdominal cavity with surgeries such as laparotomies. However, in the setting of small primary umbilical hernias little is known about optimal suture choice for repair. While many surgeons use non-absorbable suture, there are also those who use absorbable suture in these cases with reportedly good outcomes.

Our study's primary outcome aims to identify if there is less recurrence based on suture type. Secondary outcomes were evaluated looking for recurrence rates between repair techniques as well as comparisons between permanent and absorbable monofilament suture. In addition, we evaluated the rate of suture granulomas and wound infections.

Sensitivity analyses verified our results; OR estimates are very close. But here — probably due to larger samples and a higher power — more significant effects in favor of the Shouldice method are found. This corresponds to the literature, and there can be no assurance that those significances are due to overestimation.

### Has shouldice repair in a selected group of patients with inguinal hernia comparable results to lichtenstein, TEP and TAPP techniques? [^116bKHFf]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Likewise, on comparing the Shouldice versus TEP a relevant systematic difference was detected in the intraoperative complications in favor of the Shouldice operation. However, postoperative complications were more common on using the Shouldice technique.

On comparing the Shouldice with the TAPP technique, no systematic difference was noted for any of the outcome parameters.

In a multivariable logistic regression model as sensitivity analyses even more significant effects in favor of the Shouldice technique are found. But this needs to be carefully interpreted, because it can be an effect of larger samples, a higher power or even overestimation.

The results presented here are based on the described patient collective which was formed as per the typical characteristics of the matching variables. The Shouldice patient collective was characterized by younger patients with a mean age of 40 years, larger proportion of women of around 30%, mean BMI value of 24 and a proportion of EHS I (< 1.5 cm) and EHS II (1.5–3 cm) defect sizes of more than 85%. Besides, risk factors such as high ASA score and continuing treatment with coumarin derivatives and with platelet aggregation inhibitors were significantly less common in the Shouldice group. As such, the patients operated on with the Shouldice technique, as documented by the Herniamed Registry, tended to be younger, slimmer, with smaller defects and no risk factors. The Herniamed data now demonstrate that this selected patient group can be operated on with a good outcome with the Shouldice technique and with no evidence of any major disadvantages coming to light up to the end of first postoperative year compared with TAPP. The Shouldice technique was even found to have advantages over the Lichtenstein operation thanks to lower rates of pain at rest and on exertion at one-year follow-up. Compared with TEP, the intraoperative complication rate was significantly lower, but the postoperative complication rate was somewhat higher. Similarly, an Austrian prospective randomized control trial did not find any significant difference between the Shouldice, Bassini, Lichtenstein, TEP and TAPP surgical techniques with regard to the recurrence rate and complications up to three years following surgery.

### Ebstein repair: how I do it [^112KyQsA]. JTCVS Techniques (2020). Medium credibility.

An oblique right atriotomy is performed from the right atrial appendage toward the inferior vena cava that is parallel to the atrioventricular groove. The left heart is vented with a catheter inserted across the atrial septum. Exposure of the tricuspid annulus is facilitated with stay sutures placed in the true tricuspid annulus at 10- and 2-o'clock positions. Preliminary examination of the valve is done with saline injection into the RV to determine the extent of leaflet mobility, sites of tethering, and areas of noncoaptation, and the atrialized RV is evaluated. The membranous septum and atrioventricular node are identified by a small vein (vein of D) in fatty tissue that is characteristically present.

The anterior leaflet is detached at the annulus at approximately 8-o'clock position (close to the anteroseptal commissure). The incision is extended clockwise around to the inferior annulus toward the coronary sinus; this incision ends when leaflet tissue ends and is often in the area of 2-o'clock position, where inferior leaflet tissue is diminutive or absent, or further rightward (2- to 4-o'clock positions) when inferior leaflet tissue is present. It is common for a true space to be present between the anterior leaflet and the RV in various areas consistent with adequately delaminated leaflet. However, when the transition is met between the anterior and inferior leaflets, it is common to have failure of delamination resulting in fibrous and muscular attachments between the leaflet and RV myocardium. The dissection continues in a way that a portion of anterior leaflet and available inferior leaflet is "surgically delaminated", ie, surgically peeled off of the RV (Figure 2). The most important aspect of surgical delamination is to incise (and excise) all fibrous and muscular attachments between the body of the leaflet and the RV free wall but to maintain intact all fibrous and (occasionally muscular) attachments to the leading edge of the leaflet(s). Leaflet muscularization is sometimes noted in the anterior and inferior leaflets… this is debulked as much as possible to improve and optimize leaflet pliability. It is important to examine the leaflet anatomy from both sides. Specifically, the leading edge of the leaflet is examined to see whether there are individual chordal attachments present or whether a broad segment of the leading edge is attached directly to the myocardium — this is referred to as a "linear attachment"; management of this abnormality is described to follow.

Central Message

Cone repair for Ebstein anomaly results in circumferential leaflet tissue surrounding the atrioventricular junction.

See Commentaries on pages 277 and 279.

The most contemporary repair technique that provides a near-anatomic reconstruction was described by da Silva and colleagues. More recent outcomes in larger numbers of patients undergoing cone repair have been reported, and modifications to the original cone repair including re-repair techniques have also been described. In contrast to previous techniques that focused on an anterior leaflet monocusp method, the cone repair results in 360° of tricuspid leaflet tissue surrounding the right atrioventricular junction. This allows leaflet-to-leaflet tissue coaptation, similar to what occurs with normal tricuspid valve anatomy. In addition, the reconstructed tricuspid valve is reattached at the true tricuspid valve annulus so the valve hinge point is now in a nearly normal anatomical location. Atrialized right ventricle (RV) (typically the inferior wall) is plicated to eliminate areas of RV dyskinesis, and redundant right atrium is excised. The cone reconstruction restores the appearance of near-normal tricuspid valve anatomy (Figure 1) and function more than previously described techniques that revolved mostly around a monocusp repair with coaptation of the anterior leaflet with the ventricular septum or diminutive septal leaflet.

Figure 1
Completed Ebstein repair that includes cone reconstruction of the tricuspid valve (circumferential leaflet tissue surrounding the atrioventricular junction), plication of the atrialized right ventricle inferiorly, and right reduction atrioplasty.

We have gained substantial surgical experience with Ebstein anomaly since 1972 (overall > 1400; Cone repair ∼400). The purpose of this review is to share the lessons we have learned with tricuspid valve repair in the setting of Ebstein anomaly, and many of these principles can be applied to other congenital and acquired pathologies of the tricuspid valve.

### Technical and biological modifications for enhanced flexor tendon repair [^114wBbcV]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Clinical outcomes after intrasynovial flexor tendon repair have been substantially improved over the past 2 decades through advances in tendon suture techniques and postoperative rehabilitation methods. Nevertheless, complications such as repair site elongation (i.e., gap formation) and rupture continue to occur frequently. Experimental studies have shown that repair site strength fails to increase in the first 3 weeks after tendon suture. After 3 weeks, the strength and rigidity of the repair site improve significantly, a process that continues for several months. Formation of a repair site gap during the early rehabilitation period has been shown to considerably delay the accrual of repair site strength over time. Thus, it is of prime importance that the method of tendon suture achieves and maintains a stiff and strong repair site during the early healing interval by maintaining close approximation of the tendon stumps and by stimulating, where possible, the intrinsic repair response. In this review, we describe recent efforts to enhance the integrity of the immature repair site. We focus on 2 major areas of advancement: surgical technique modifications and manipulation of the biologic and biochemical environment.

### Commentary: 180–180 repair of bicuspid aortic valve works every time… except when it doesn' T [^111Z5t5k]. JTCVS Techniques (2021). Medium credibility.

Sievers type 1 RL, which is asymmetric but can fit into the 180-degree paradigm.

Central Message

A novel bicuspid aortic valve classification moves beyond current descriptive classification systems toward a prescriptive guide invoking symmetry as the answer to geometric complexity.

See Article page.

As experience in aortic valve repair has lagged somewhat behind surgical repair of the mitral valve, there has been a trend toward analogizing the 2 pathologies. Conceptually, there has been utility in this strategy by categorizing different modes of aortic insufficiency, thereby organizing the various approaches to repair. The classification system developed by Dr El Khoury 15 years ago shifted the classification paradigm beyond purely morphological descriptions by correlating functional phenotype with repair techniques. With further expertise in aortic root physiology and phenotypes, it has become apparent that there are 3-dimensional complexities to aortic valve repair that begin to muddle the mitral repair analogies. This may be most apparent in bicuspid valves, as described by the Brussels group. The authors should again be congratulated for developing granularity in their classification system beyond the presence and location of cusp fusion and elaboration of the associated repair strategies.

The authors further categorize bicuspid valves based on the commissural orientation into 3 categories spanning the spectrum from 120 degrees to 180 degrees. Notably, the distribution of cusp fusion (RL, RN, LN) was equal among the symmetric, asymmetric, and very asymmetric phenotypes, implying that the widely used Sievers classification is less useful for identifying that type of repair technique that should be used. In addition to the CO, geometric heights of the cusps, length of raphe fusion, and raphe heights are all variables to be accounted for intraoperatively when deciding on a repair strategy — a potentially daunting number of variables for the less experienced. The solution to these complexities is to simplify the geometric conundrum by recreating symmetry around the nonfused "normal" leaflet. The 180-degree reimplantation technique as the authors describe facilitates circumferential symmetry at the levels of the ventriculoaortic junction and the neo-sinotubular junction and vertical symmetry of the commissures and cusp nadirs. Final adjustments to leaflet free margin length can then be made by plication or closure of an incomplete raphe.

### Commentary: dogma to diachronicity: evolving to lesion-specific repair of Barlow valves [^111Ea7DB]. JTCVS Techniques (2021). Medium credibility.

A lesion-specific tailored approach may facilitate durable mitral repair of Barlow valves.

Central Message

Understanding the functional anatomy and pathoanatomic mechanism of a Barlow valve provides guidance for a targeted, lesion-specific, and durable mitral repair.

See Article page.

In this issue of the Journal, Barlow and colleaguestake us on a historical journey through John Barlow's eponymous description of the most severe form of myxomatous mitral valve degeneration. The authorspoint out that Barlow valves, instead of Barlow's disease, may be the more appropriate nomenclature to describe the pathoanatomic features and management of this form of diffuse bileaflet myxomatous degeneration. In the 4 decades since Barlow's initial description, diagnosis and surgical management have substantially evolved. Advances in diagnostic imaging methods along with an enhanced understanding of functional anatomy have enabled targeted, patient-specific repair techniques.,

Carpentier, who coined the term Barlow valve, outlined the principles of mitral valve repair with quadrangular leaflet resection, annular plication, chordal shortening, chordal transfer, and ring annuloplasty, to provide the foundation for our current surgical techniques for repair. To durably repair primary degenerative mitral regurgitation, instead of using a dogmatic approach based on one method, most now prefer a diachronic one — developed through assimilated technical advancement and lesion-specific therapy.,

For bileaflet pathology, many experienced surgeons now advocate for a primarily posterior leaflet solution whenever feasible. Larger annuloplasty rings and tailored lesion-specific therapy may treat the primary pathology, restore excellent depth of coaptation and optimal effective orifice area, while simultaneously mitigating risk of systolic anterior motion. Applying limited focal resections, respecting with nonresection techniques facilitated by polytetrafluoroethylene neochords, or a combination of both with a "respectful resection" are all methods to arrive at the same solution. In some situations, extensive sliding leaflet valvuloplasty may indeed be required to reduce posterior leaflet height in the setting of a severe Barlow valve. However, in less-severe cases, excessive resection with or without annular plication may be accompanied by unwanted leaflet tension and limited mobility of the posterior leaflet, both negative influences for long-term durability. Similarly, relative immobility can be caused by excess tension applied to the posterior leaflet with neochordal nonresection techniques.

Chapter 13: Role for open preperitoneal mesh placement in the era of laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair

What is the role of open preperitoneal hernia repair in the era of laparasoscopic inguinal hernia repair?

Search terms: "open preperitoneal hernia repair"; "laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair"; "TAPP" AND "preperitoneal" AND "hernia repair"; "TEP" AND "preperitoneal" AND "hernia repair"; "preperitoneal" AND "hernia" AND "repair"

Statements

Recommendations

The approach to inguinal hernia has been evolving since Bassini first described it. There are proponents of open anterior tissue repairs (Shouldice), open preperitoneal repairs, open anterior repairs with mesh, and laparoscopic repairs with mesh, including TAPP (laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal repair) and TEP (laparoscopic totally extraperitoneal repair). Many different open preperitoneal approaches have been described, making it difficult to summarize and compare them with laparoscopic approaches.

Two Level 1A studies concluded that endoscopic repairs do have advantages in terms of local complications, pain-associated parameters, and faster return to normal activities; however, "Well structured trials with improved standardization of hernia type, operative technique, and surgeons' experience are necessary" [1, 2]. Both of these studies were reviewed by the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects in 2008. It was concluded that "overall methodological quality of the studies was poor and limited the conclusions that could be drawn". However, laparoscopic hernia repairs did have less postoperative pain and faster return to normal activities.

The five Level 1B studies have been outlined in Table 1 and overall are in favor of laparoscopic approaches due to less pain and faster return to normal activity [3–7]. Champault et al. [3] compared 51 patients with TEP to 49 patients with Stoppa. They noted a 6% recurrence rate with TEP and 2% with Stoppa repair, although the mesh used for TEP was smaller (11 × 6 vs. 12 × 15 cm 2). Morbidity was only 4% with TEP compared with 30% with Stoppa (p = 0.01). TEP also had less pain and a faster recovery with statistical significance.

Scrotal Resection

A superficial skin incision in a 'tear drop' configuration is marked with pen and performed from the the lateral third of the inguinal ligament to the scrotum, including the raphe (Fig. 1 b). Any previous incisional scars from previous surgery within the inguinoscrotal region should be resected, including tissue potentially contaminated with cancer cells. The incision is deepened down to the inguinal ligament and is continued medially around the spermatic cord further to Buck's facia of the penis, where care should be taken not to injure the urethra (Fig. 1 c). From the base of the penis, the plane of the scrotal septum can be followed; however, it is often included in the resection to ensure oncological control (Fig. 1 d). Care should be taken not to dissect too far caudal and lateral to avoid injury to the long saphenous and femoral veins. An en bloc orchidectomy is performed with the overlying scrotal skin attached (Fig. 1 e). The proximal extent of the inguinal cord resection is predicated on the pre-operative characteristic of the tumour assessed clinically and radiologically. If necessary, the inguinal canal may need exploration, with resection back to the internal ring as described below.

Resection of the Spermatic Chord and Reconstruction

The en bloc orchidectomy specimen is lifted, and the external oblique fascia is opened in the direction of its fibres towards the internal inguinal ring (Fig. 1 f). The cremaster muscle fibres are separated perpendicular to the cord to expose the internal ring until preperitoneal fat is identified. The spermatic cord is clamped, transfixed and divided, ensuring the specimen is fully excised. In rare cases with intra-abdominal extension of tumour, a laparotomy is required to ensure complete resection. The inguinal canal is supported in a Bassini fashion by approximating the conjoint tendon (formed by the distal ends of the transversus abdominis and internal oblique muscles) to the inguinal ligament with interrupted 3–0 polypropylene, and the oblique fascia is closed using a running 3–0 polypropylene (Fig. 1 g).

### Site-specific prolapse surgery. II. vaginal paravaginal repair augmented with either synthetic mesh or remodelling xenograft [^116rDFhy]. International Urogynecology Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Over the course of two centuries, general surgeons have developed a set of operative rules to minimise the contribution of mechanical factors to failed hernia repair (Table 4). The cardinal rule was to repair all site-specific fascial defects, sewing identical tissue within the same layer, using interrupted stitches of permanent suture, without undue suture line tension in any direction. It was also traditional to re-secure the abdominal connective tissues to the axial skeleton by sewing the conjoint tendon to the inguinal ligament. These manoeuvres were broadly successful, but excessive wound tension sometimes impeded healing. Some 25 years ago, surgeons turned to mesh implants as the best way of reducing wound tension and postoperative pain. Such a strategy also made repair of the mechanical defect technically easier and serendipitously reinforced any weakness in the adjacent connective tissues. The key question is whether gynaecologists should adopt these surgical rules, at least at a theoretic level. Results from this study appear to support that contention. Success rates for prolapse repair improved with increasing adherence to the hernia principles. Anterior colporrhaphy meets none of these rules, and is predictably inferior. Native tissue VPVR satisfies the criterion of being a site-specific technique, analogous to a Bassini or Shouldice hernia repair. However, all sutured repairs increase wound tension, and any adjacent collagen weakness remains unresolved. Bridging graft repair is exactly analogous to modern prosthetic hernioplasty; it is completely tension-free and carries the added advantage of simplifying the operative dissection. Results improved with any form of augmentation. All 19 women in the synthetic mesh group had successful anatomic outcomes, reflecting the tension-free attributes and almost indestructible nature of synthetic implants. However, severe mesh morbidity necessitated removal of polypropylene prostheses in three women — reducing ultimate surgical success to 84.2%. Use of Surgisis ® ES, a resorbable tissue-inductive xenograft, delivered the best results (92.1% 5-year anatomic success).

Figure 5
Identification of the atrialized (smooth and non-trabeculated) right ventricle inferiorly marked by the dotted triangle. The base of the triangle crosses the atrioventricular groove so the diameter of the dilated annulus is reduced in size as the plication is completed.

Figure 6
Completed plication suture line of the atrialized right ventricle. It is essential to inspect the epicardial surface of the right ventricle to confirm that there is no compromise of the right coronary artery or any of its major branches. Note persistent size discrepancy between the neotricuspid orifice and the true annulus.

After the RV plication is completed, the neotricuspid valve is reattached at the level of the tricuspid annulus. Since the neotricuspid valve will have an orifice that is smaller than the original dilated atrioventricular junction, additional annular plication may be necessary to match the size of the smaller neotricuspid valve orifice. Options include a single plication site at the inferior annulus when a limited annular reduction is desired. If the size discrepancy between the larger true tricuspid annulus and the smaller neotricuspid valve is substantial, smaller annular plication sutures are evenly spaced in multiple areas around the true annulus in order to avoid distortion of the right coronary artery by a large (inferior) plication in a single location.

After the inferior annulus is plicated to the appropriate size to match the neotricuspid valve, the proximal cone leaflet tissue is anchored at the true annulus with fine continuous monofilament suture. To avoid heart block, the septal reattachment suture line is performed just caudal to the membranous septum and AV node that is marked by the previously described vein of D (Figure 7).

Figure 7
Intraoperative photo showing apical displacement of the septal leaflet. The arrow signifies the conduction tissue marked by the vein of D and the white membranous septum immediately to the left of the vein.

The completed cone reconstruction of the tricuspid valve is evaluated for competency with RV saline injection. Any residual fenestrations or areas of leak are repaired as needed. Natural "zones of apposition" or "clefts" are not routinely closed unless there is evidence of residual leak present in those areas. Empiric closure of these natural "clefts" can result in leaflet distortion and may cause more residual leakage; hence, it is important to wait until the completion of the repair and then examine the valve with saline injection to be sure that cleft approximation is indeed necessary.
