Whats jnc8 bp goals

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the JNC 8 (2014) blood pressure treatment goals are by age and comorbidity, with clear thresholds for treatment initiation and targets, based strictly on the JNC 8 sources provided. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the general population targets for adults aged 60 years and older. Then, I should verify the goals for adults younger than 60, separating evidence-based diastolic targets from expert-opinion systolic targets. Next, I will review the specific recommendations for diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease, ensuring I do not conflate them with prior or later guidelines. After that, I will check the treatment initiation thresholds by age and condition. Finally, I will reconcile any discrepancies and summarize succinctly, being careful not to import non–JNC 8 targets from other societies or years.

> Let me first confirm the recommendation for older adults. For the general population aged 60 years or older, JNC 8 recommends initiating pharmacologic therapy at SBP ≥ 150 mmHg or DBP ≥ 90 mmHg, and treating to a target BP of SBP < 150 mmHg and DBP < 90 mmHg; if treatment leads to SBP < 140 mmHg without adverse effects, therapy does not need to be adjusted upward, but the formal goal remains < 150/90 mmHg [^115CjvEw] [^117H73sr].

> Now, I need to verify the goals for adults younger than 60. For ages 30–59, JNC 8 supports a diastolic goal of DBP < 90 mmHg based on evidence from randomized trials; for systolic pressure in this group, the panel found insufficient RCT evidence and therefore recommends SBP < 140 mmHg based on expert opinion rather than direct trial data, so I should be explicit about that distinction [^115CjvEw].

> Hold on, I should verify the 18–29 year group carefully because this is easy to overstate. Initially, I was going to say the diastolic goal DBP < 90 mmHg is evidence-based for ages 18–29, since a companion JNC 8 summary lists DBP < 90 mmHg for 18–29 and 30–59 year olds; but wait, let me verify the evidentiary strength for those under 30 years [^111LQYRW]. On re-reading the primary JNC 8 panel report, it explicitly says there is insufficient evidence for a diastolic goal in hypertensive persons younger than 30 years, thus the recommendation for those 18–29 years is SBP < 140 mmHg and DBP < 90 mmHg based on expert opinion rather than trial evidence; so I need to correct myself and label the 18–29 year target as expert-opinion–based, not evidence-based [^115CjvEw] [^116BWX61].

> Next, I will examine the diabetes mellitus subgroup. I need to ensure I do not import older, lower targets from JNC 7 or later intensive targets from ACC/AHA; in JNC 8, adults with diabetes have the same thresholds and goals as the general hypertensive population younger than 60 years, meaning initiate therapy at SBP ≥ 140 mmHg or DBP ≥ 90 mmHg and treat to a goal of < 140/90 mmHg [^115CjvEw] [^112inVHR] [^114a8fUm].

> For chronic kidney disease, let me confirm the alignment. JNC 8 likewise recommends initiating therapy at SBP ≥ 140 mmHg or DBP ≥ 90 mmHg in adults with CKD and treating to a goal of < 140/90 mmHg, explicitly aligning CKD targets with those for the general population younger than 60 years; I should emphasize that this is a change from JNC 7's < 130/80 mmHg goal to avoid confusion [^1118rZC5] [^115CjvEw] [^111USxYQ].

> I should double-check the treatment initiation thresholds across groups so I state them cleanly. For adults aged ≥ 60 years without diabetes or CKD, initiate pharmacotherapy at SBP ≥ 150 mmHg or DBP ≥ 90 mmHg and treat to < 150/90 mmHg; for adults aged < 60 years, and for adults of any age with diabetes or CKD, initiate at SBP ≥ 140 mmHg or DBP ≥ 90 mmHg and treat to < 140/90 mmHg; I need to ensure I do not inadvertently apply lower thresholds from other guidelines here [^115CjvEw] [^117H73sr].

> But wait, what about how JNC 8 differs from JNC 7? I should confirm the key shifts to prevent misapplication of prior targets. JNC 8 relaxed the SBP goal for older adults from < 140 mmHg to < 150 mmHg and raised the goals for diabetes and CKD from < 130/80 mmHg to < 140/90 mmHg, reflecting RCT evidence that did not show additional benefit from more aggressive targets; this historical context is important for readers familiar with earlier thresholds [^115CjvEw] [^111USxYQ].

> In summary, the JNC 8 blood pressure goals are as follows: for adults aged 60 years or older without diabetes or CKD, initiate at ≥ 150/90 mmHg and treat to < 150/90 mmHg; for adults younger than 60 years, and for adults of any age with diabetes or CKD, initiate at ≥ 140/90 mmHg and treat to < 140/90 mmHg; for ages 30–59, the DBP < 90 mmHg target is evidence-based, whereas the SBP < 140 mmHg target is expert-opinion–based, and for ages 18–29, both SBP < 140 mmHg and DBP < 90 mmHg are recommended based on expert opinion rather than direct trial evidence [^115CjvEw] [^111LQYRW] [^116BWX61] [^112inVHR] [^114a8fUm] [^1118rZC5] [^117H73sr] [^111USxYQ].

---

JNC 8 blood pressure goals are: **< 150/90 mm Hg for adults ≥ 60 years without diabetes or CKD** [^115CjvEw] and **< 140/90 mm Hg for adults < 60 years or any age with diabetes** [^112inVHR] or CKD [^1118rZC5] [^116BWX61]. These targets are based on randomized trials demonstrating reductions in stroke, heart failure, and cardiovascular events [^111LQYRW], and care should be individualized for frail older adults or those experiencing adverse effects [^1139ZnH6].

## JNC 8 blood pressure goals by population

| **Population** | **SBP goal (mm hg)** | **DBP goal (mm hg)** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|-|
| General population ≥ 60 years (without diabetes or CKD) | < 150 | < 90 | Strong (Grade A) |
| General population < 60 years | < 140 | < 90 | Moderate (Grade B) |
| Adults ≥ 18 years with diabetes (any age) | < 140 | < 90 | Expert opinion (Grade E) [^112inVHR] |
| Adults ≥ 18 years with CKD (any age) | < 140 | < 90 | Expert opinion (Grade E) [^1118rZC5] |

---

## Rationale and evidence supporting JNC 8 recommendations

- **General population ≥ 60 years**: The < 150/90 mm Hg target is supported by RCTs showing reduced stroke, heart failure, and cardiovascular events.
- **General population < 60 years**: The < 140/90 mm Hg target is based on moderate evidence for cardiovascular risk reduction.
- **Diabetes and CKD**: The < 140/90 mm Hg target is based on expert opinion and available evidence, balancing benefits and risks [^112inVHR] [^1118rZC5].

---

## Clinical implications and controversies

Clinical implications include JNC 8's emphasis on **individualized care**, especially in older adults, to balance the benefits and risks of intensive BP lowering. Controversies center on the **higher SBP target for adults ≥ 60 years**, given concerns about potential increases in cardiovascular risk for some patients [^114REJzc].

---

## Comparison with previous guidelines

Compared with previous guidelines, **JNC 7** recommended < 140/90 mm Hg for most adults and < 130/80 mm Hg for those with diabetes or CKD [^113a4Wtd], whereas **JNC 8** raised the SBP target to < 150 mm Hg for adults ≥ 60 years without diabetes or CKD and adopted a uniform < 140/90 mm Hg target for diabetes and CKD [^115CjvEw].

---

In sum, **< 150/90 mm Hg for adults ≥ 60 years without diabetes or CKD**; **< 140/90 mm Hg for adults < 60 years or any age with diabetes or CKD** — tailor treatment to tolerance, comorbidities, and adverse effects [^115CjvEw].

### 2014 evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adults: report from the panel members appointed to the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) [^1118rZC5]. JAMA (2014). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for hypertension, particularly in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), the 2014 JNC 8 guidelines recommend initiating pharmacologic treatment in adult patients with CKD to lower blood pressure (BP) at a systolic blood pressure (SBP) of ≥ 140 mmHg or a diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of ≥ 90 mmHg and treating to reach a goal of SBP < 140 mmHg and DBP < 90 mmHg.

### 2014 evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adults: Report from the panel members appointed to the eighth joint national committee (JNC 8) [^115CjvEw]. JAMA (2014). High credibility.

Hypertension is the most common condition seen in primary care and leads to myocardial infarction, stroke, renal failure, and death if not detected early and treated appropriately. Patients want to be assured that blood pressure (BP) treatment will reduce their disease burden, while clinicians seek guidance on hypertension management using the best scientific evidence. This report adopts a rigorous, evidence-based approach to recommend treatment thresholds, goals, and medications in the management of hypertension in adults. Evidence was drawn from randomized controlled trials, which represent the gold standard for determining efficacy and effectiveness. Evidence quality and recommendations were graded based on their effect on important outcomes.

There is strong evidence to support treating hypertensive persons aged 60 years or older to a BP goal of less than 150/90 mm Hg and hypertensive persons 30 through 59 years of age to a diastolic goal of less than 90 mm Hg. However, there is insufficient evidence in hypertensive persons younger than 60 years for a systolic goal, or in those younger than 30 years for a diastolic goal. Therefore, the panel recommends a BP of less than 140/90 mm Hg for those groups based on expert opinion. The same thresholds and goals are recommended for hypertensive adults with diabetes or nondiabetic chronic kidney disease (CKD) as for the general hypertensive population younger than 60 years. There is moderate evidence to support initiating drug treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker, or calcium channel blocker.

### Uncontrolled hypertension by the 2014 evidence-based guideline: results from NHANES 2011–2012 [^1152pkJz]. Journal of Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

To assess the prevalence of uncontrolled hypertension in the population, various hypertension guidelines were used: the Seventh Joint National Committee (JNC 7), the European Society of Hypertension/European Society of Cardiology (ESH/ESC), and the Canadian Hypertension Education Program (CHEP). The study also aimed to determine predictors for reclassification to controlled hypertension based on the 2014 evidence-based guideline (2014 EBG) compared to JNC 7.

Using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 2011–2012, the prevalence of uncontrolled hypertension was ascertained according to different guidelines, including 2014 EBG, JNC 7, ESH/ESC, and CHEP. Further examination was conducted on subgroups categorized by age, sex, race, and the presence of chronic kidney disease or diabetes. Predictors for reclassification to controlled hypertension by the 2014 EBG were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression.

The results showed that the prevalence of uncontrolled hypertension was 12.8% according to the 2014 EBG, compared to 16.6% by JNC 7, 13.6% by ESH/ESC, and 15.6% by CHEP (P < 0.001). According to JNC 7, 23.0% of those with uncontrolled hypertension were reclassified to controlled hypertension by the 2014 EBG. Those most likely to be reclassified to controlled hypertension were older, female, and those with diabetes.

In conclusion, the updated 2014 evidence-based high blood pressure guideline changes the percentage of the US population labeled as suffering from uncontrolled hypertension from 16.6% to 12.8%.

### Comparative cost-effectiveness of conservative or intensive blood pressure treatment guidelines in adults aged 35–74 years: The cardiovascular disease policy model [^117WSJBJ]. Hypertension (2016). Low credibility.

The population health effect and cost-effectiveness of implementing intensive blood pressure goals in high-cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk adults have not been described. Using the CVD Policy Model, CVD events, treatment costs, quality-adjusted life years, and drug and monitoring costs were simulated over 2016 to 2026 for hypertensive patients aged 35 to 74 years. We projected the effectiveness and costs of hypertension treatment according to the 2003 Joint National Committee (JNC) -7 or 2014 JNC8 guidelines, and then for adults aged ≥ 50 years, we assessed the cost-effectiveness of adding an intensive goal of systolic blood pressure < 120 mmHg for patients with CVD, chronic kidney disease, or 10-year CVD risk ≥ 15%. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios < $50,000 per quality-adjusted life years gained were considered cost-effective. JNC7 strategies treat more patients and are more costly to implement compared with JNC8 strategies. Adding intensive systolic blood pressure goals for high-risk patients prevents an estimated 43,000 and 35,000 annual CVD events incremental to JNC8 and JNC7, respectively. Intensive strategies save costs in men and are cost-effective in women compared with JNC8 alone. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000 per quality-adjusted life years gained, JNC8+intensive had the highest probability of cost-effectiveness in women (82%) and JNC7+intensive the highest probability of cost-effectiveness in men (100%). Assuming higher drug and monitoring costs, adding intensive goals for high-risk patients remained consistently cost-effective in men, but not always.

### Implications of the eighth Joint National Committee guidelines for the management of high blood pressure for aging adults: Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study [^113PzYrs]. Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

The recent 2014 evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adults from the Eighth Joint National Committee panel may significantly affect the aging US population. We performed a cross-sectional analysis of black and white participants in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study who participated in the fifth study visit (2011–2013). Sitting blood pressure was calculated from the average of three successive readings taken following a five-minute rest. Currently prescribed antihypertensive medications were recorded by reviewing medication containers brought to the visit. Blood pressure control was defined using both the Seventh and Eighth Joint National Committee thresholds.

Of 6,088 participants (mean age, 75.6 [range, 66–90] years; 58.4% women; 23.2% black), 54.9% had either diabetes mellitus or chronic kidney disease. The prevalence of hypertension according to the Seventh Joint National Committee thresholds was 81.9%, and 62.8% of the entire sample were at blood pressure goal. Using the Eighth Joint National Committee thresholds, 79.4% were at blood pressure goal, with 16.6% reclassified as at goal. Reclassification was higher for individuals with diabetes mellitus or chronic kidney disease (20.6%) compared to individuals without either condition (11.6%).

Use of antihypertensive medications in our cohort was high, with 75.0% prescribed at least one antihypertensive medication and 46.7% on two or more antihypertensive agents. In conclusion, in a US cohort of aging white and black individuals, approximately 1 in 6 individuals were reclassified as having blood pressure at goal by the new guidelines.

### Association of blood pressure with decline in renal function and time until the start of renal replacement therapy in pre-dialysis patients: a cohort study [^115RcpmB]. BMC Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

The proposed blood pressure treatment target goal for patients with CKD is < 130/80 mmHg, according to the K/DOQI, JNC 7, and AHA treatment guidelines for hypertension in CKD patients. The results of our study show that pre-dialysis patients with blood pressure below this target have the slowest decline in renal function and the latest start of RRT. Our results support the beneficial effect of keeping blood pressure levels, especially for systolic blood pressure, below this treatment target goal at the start of pre-dialysis care. Randomized controlled trials are necessary to demonstrate whether active blood pressure lowering below this target is beneficial in pre-dialysis patients.

### 2014 evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adults: Report from the panel members appointed to the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) [^114BoaGX]. JAMA (2014). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for hypertension, particularly with respect to the choice of antihypertensives and subsequent therapy, the JNC 8 2014 guidelines recommend considering the addition of antihypertensive drugs from other classes if the goal blood pressure cannot be achieved using only the initial drugs. This recommendation accounts for potential contraindications or the necessity of using more than three drugs to meet the target blood pressure.

### Blood pressure targets in adults with hypertension: A clinical practice guideline from the AAFP [^11649az8]. American Family Physician (2022). High credibility.

The AAFP 2022 guidelines recommend, regarding medical management for hypertension, and more specifically with respect to the goals of treatment, blood pressure targets, and the general population, to consider treating adult patients with hypertension to a lower blood pressure target (< 135/85 mmHg) to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction.

### Blood pressure goal in chronic kidney disease: What is the evidence [^116ngdbG]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2011). Low credibility.

Most guidelines recommend that seated clinic blood pressure (BP) be targeted to less than 130/80 mmHg in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The evidence underlying these recommendations is the subject of this review.

- **Recent findings**: The best evidence to target a certain level of BP in patients with CKD comes from randomized trials. Only three trials have prospectively examined the level to which BP should be lowered. These trials, conducted exclusively among patients with CKD, have demonstrated that compared to a less aggressive BP goal, a BP goal of less than 130/80 mmHg neither saves lives nor protects the kidney or the cardiovascular system.

- **Summary**: It is reasonable to achieve a goal of less than 140/90 mmHg in most patients with CKD. More aggressive lowering is not firmly supported by data. Since BP control is important, hypertension therapy should be individualized. Individualization through home BP measurements to diagnose, monitor, and treat hypertension appears to be an attractive option.

### 2024 ESC guidelines for the management of elevated blood pressure and hypertension [^116RZYXB]. European Heart Journal (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for hypertension, specifically concerning treatment goals, blood pressure targets, and elderly patients, the ESC 2024 guidelines recommend setting personalized and more lenient blood pressure targets (such as < 140 mmHg) for patients aged 85 years and older.

### Blood pressure control and pharmacotherapy patterns in the United States before and after the release of the Joint National Committee on the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC 7) guidelines [^115KUtvE]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Despite recommendations from the Joint National Committee on the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC 7), only 36.8% of patients were at target blood pressure (BP) in 2003 and 2004. The objective of this study was to assess improvements in BP control and treatment patterns before and after the publication of JNC 7.

- **Methods**: This was a retrospective, time series analysis of 27 provider groups and managed care organizations from 1998 through 2006. Patients with hypertension were identified from more than 4000 physicians. Medical charts were collected and clinical data were evaluated using prevailing JNC criteria during the time period before and after JNC 7.

- **Results**: A total of 19,258 patients were identified with hypertension: 15,258 included in the before-JNC 7 cohort and 4,000 in the after-JNC 7 cohort. BP control in the before-JNC 7 cohort was 40.8% compared with 49.3% in the after-JNC 7 cohort (P < .0001). After controlling for demographic and clinical covariates, patients in the before-JNC 7 cohort were 45% less likely to achieve BP control compared with the after-JNC 7 cohort (odds ratio, 0.551; P < .0001).

Although findings indicate BP control is improving, a significant need for further improvement remains.

### Impact of the 2014 expert panel recommendations for management of high blood pressure on contemporary cardiovascular practice: Insights from the NCDR PINNACLE registry [^115EviqL]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Since 2003, the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee (JNC-7) has been the predominant guideline for blood pressure management. A 2014 expert panel recommended increasing the blood pressure targets for patients aged 60 years and older, as well as those with diabetes or chronic kidney disease.

- **Objectives**: The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of the 2014 expert panel blood pressure management recommendations on patients managed in U.S. ambulatory cardiovascular practices.

- **Methods**: Using the National Cardiovascular Data Registry PINNACLE Registry, we assessed the proportion of patients who met the 2003 and 2014 panel recommendations, highlighting the populations of patients for whom the blood pressure goals changed.

- **Results**: Of 1,185,253 patients in the study cohort, 706,859 (59.6%) achieved the 2003 JNC-7 goals. Using the 2014 recommendations, 880,378 (74.3%) patients were at goal. Among the 173,519 (14.6%) for whom goal achievement changed, 40,323 (23.2%) had a prior stroke or transient ischemic attack, and 112,174 (64.6%) had coronary artery disease. In addition, the average Framingham risk score in this group was 8.5 ± 3.2%, and the 10-year ASCVD risk score was 28.0 ± 19.5%.

- **Conclusions**: Among U.S. ambulatory cardiology patients with hypertension, nearly 1 in 7 who did not meet JNC-7 recommendations would now meet the 2014 treatment goals. If the new recommendations are implemented in clinical practice, blood pressure target achievement and cardiovascular events will need careful monitoring.

### The 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association hypertension guideline and blood pressure in older adults [^1175oSus]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

The 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association blood pressure guideline redefined hypertension and lowered the blood pressure treatment target. Empirical data on the guideline's impact are needed.

- **Methods**: Data were analyzed from Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study participants who attended baseline pre-guideline (2016–2017) and post-guideline (2018–2019) visits with baseline systolic blood pressure between 120 and 159 mmHg. Participants were grouped according to baseline systolic blood pressure by change in classification under the new guideline as follows: not reclassified (120–129 mmHg), reclassified to Stage 1 hypertension (130–139 mmHg), and reclassified to Stage 2 hypertension (140–159 mmHg). Means and 95% CIs for systolic blood pressure changes between baseline and follow-up, changes in antihypertensive use, and percentages that achieved the post-guideline recommendation (systolic blood pressure < 130 mmHg) were calculated. Analyses were performed in 2021–2022.

- **Results**: Among 2,193 community-dwelling Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities participants aged 71–95 years at baseline, systolic blood pressure changes between baseline and follow-up visits differed among participants not reclassified (+4.1 mmHg, 95% CI = 3.0, 5.3 mmHg), reclassified to Stage 1 hypertension (-1.1 mmHg, 95% CI = -2.2, 0.1 mmHg), and reclassified to Stage 2 hypertension (-5.7 mmHg, 95% CI = -6.8, -4.7 mmHg). Antihypertensive use changed from 77.3% to 78.4% (p = 0.25) among participants reclassified to Stage 1 hypertension and from 78.3% to 81.4% (p < 0.01) among participants reclassified to Stage 2 hypertension.

### Blood pressure targets in adults with hypertension [^1148paiZ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). High credibility.

This is the first update of this review first published in 2009. When treating elevated blood pressure, doctors usually aim to achieve a specific blood pressure target. That target is the pressure value below which optimal clinical benefits are supposedly obtained. The "lower the better" approach, guiding the treatment of elevated blood pressure for many years, was challenged in the last decade due to a lack of evidence from randomized trials supporting that strategy. Consequently, the standard target in clinical practice in recent years has been a blood pressure below 140/90 mm Hg for the general population with elevated blood pressure. However, new trials published in recent years have reintroduced the idea of aiming for lower blood pressure targets. Therefore, it is important to assess whether the benefits of achieving targets lower than the standard outweigh the harms.

- **Objectives**: The primary goal was to determine if lower targets (any less than or equal to 135/85 mm Hg) are associated with a reduction in mortality and morbidity compared to standard targets (less than or equal to 140/90 mm Hg) for treating patients with chronic arterial hypertension. Secondary objectives were to determine if there is a change in mean achieved systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) associated with "lower targets" compared to "standard targets" in patients with chronic arterial hypertension, and to examine if there is a change in withdrawal rates.

### Proportion and characteristics of US adults who may be eligible from additional blood pressure lowering based on absolute risk [^1142UJEg]. American Journal of Hypertension (2017). Low credibility.

The Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) and the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation 3 (HOPE-3) trial demonstrated the merits of blood pressure (BP) lowering to reduce cardiovascular events in adults with intermediate to high cardiovascular risk. However, the population impact of an absolute risk-based strategy for BP lowering remains unclear.

- **Methods**: We examined three treatment thresholds using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. First, the JNC8 guideline was used to determine treatment goals. Second, adults with a systolic BP (SBP) of 130 mm Hg and high cardiovascular risk (based on eligibility for SPRINT) were considered eligible for additional BP lowering. Finally, we combined the treatment threshold for high-risk adults with an SBP treatment threshold of 140 mm Hg for intermediate-risk adults that met the eligibility criteria for HOPE-3.

- **Results**: Under the JNC8 guideline, 78.0% of adults aged ≥ 50 years were at target, while 22.0% were eligible for additional BP lowering. If an SBP treatment threshold of 130 mm Hg was used for adults at high cardiovascular risk, 31.1% would be eligible for additional BP lowering, representing an increase of 8.1 million individuals. If an SBP threshold of 140 mm Hg was additionally used for adults at intermediate risk, 31.4% of adults would be eligible for BP lowering, marking an increase of 8.3 million individuals. The proportion of adults eligible for BP lowering with established coronary artery disease decreased with the risk-based strategies.

- **Conclusion**: An absolute risk treatment strategy would modestly increase the proportion of adults eligible for BP lowering.

### Pharmacologic treatment of hypertension in adults aged 60 years or older to higher versus lower blood pressure targets: A clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians and the American Academy of Family Physicians [^1139ZnH6]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). High credibility.

In terms of medical management for hypertension, particularly regarding treatment goals and blood pressure targets in the elderly, the 2017 guidelines from the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) and the American College of Physicians (ACP) recommend considering the initiation or intensification of pharmacologic treatment to achieve a target systolic blood pressure (SBP) of less than 140 mmHg. This approach aims to reduce the risk of stroke or cardiac events in selected patients aged 60 years or older who are at high cardiovascular risk, based on individualized assessment.

Set treatment goals following a periodic discussion with the patient about the benefits and harms of specific blood pressure targets.

### Lack of effect of guideline changes on hypertension control for patients with diabetes in the US, 1995–2005 [^112a9v36]. Diabetes Care (2007). Low credibility.

To study the effect of new Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC) guidelines on hypertension control for patients with diabetes in the US, patients without diabetes were used as the control group for the time trend.

- **Research design and methods**: The JNC VI and VII guidelines, published in 1997 and 2003, set more aggressive goal blood pressure for patients with diabetes. Data from the National Disease and Therapeutic Index, a nationally representative survey of outpatient visits in the US, was used to compare the difference in hypertension control (blood pressure < 140/90 mmHg) between diabetic and nondiabetic visits during 1995–2005.

- **Results**: Hypertension control improved for both diabetic and nondiabetic visits in the study period. Compared with nondiabetic visits, there was no change in hypertension control for diabetic visits before 2001 and an approximately 4% increase afterward (P < 0.001).

- **Conclusions**: The publication of new JNC guidelines did not result in substantially better hypertension control for patients with diabetes in the U.S.

Changes in trends after guidelines

After the publication of the JNC 8 report in 2014, which removed beta blockers as a first-line therapy for most patients (except those with CAD and congestive heart failure) and recommended the use of thiazide diuretics and CCBs alone as first-line therapies for Black patients, the probability of receiving a beta blocker prescription did not change significantly from 2015 to 2017 but was 3% (95% CI, 2%–4%) lower in 2018 to 2019 compared with the pre-JNC 8 time period of 2010 to 2014. Among Black patients, the probability of receiving CCB was 20% (95% CI, 18%–22%) higher in 2015 to 2017, and 41% (95% CI, 38%–41%) higher in 2018 to 2019 compared with 2010 to 2014. The probability of receiving thiazide diuretics among Black patients did not change significantly from 2015 to 2017 and was 6% (95% CI, 8%–5%) lower in 2018 to 2019 compared with 2010 to 2014.

It also includes receiving dual therapy and FDC for patients with BP ≥ 140/90 mm Hg compared with the reference period 2015–2017 (C), controlling for order of prescription episode, site, age, sex, race, ethnicity, hypertension control, body mass index, and other chronic disease histories.

### US hypertension management guidelines: A review of the recent past and recommendations for the future [^117H73sr]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

In the general population aged ≥ 60 years, initiate pharmacologic treatment to lower blood pressure (BP) at systolic BP (SBP) ≥ 150 mm Hg or diastolic BP (DBP) ≥ 90 mm Hg and treat to a goal SBP < 150 mm Hg. This is highlighted by findings from the Japanese Trial to Assess Optimal Systolic Blood Pressure in Elderly Hypertensive Patients (JATOS), where 4,418 patients between the ages of 65 and 85 were randomized to an SBP treatment goal of either < 140 mm Hg versus 140 to < 160 mm Hg. While the intensive treatment group achieved a significantly lower BP (136/75 mm Hg versus 146/78 mm Hg), the primary endpoint of combined cardiovascular disease (CVD) and renal failure did not differ significantly between the two groups.

One limitation of this trial is its power was only adequate to detect a 40% relative risk reduction (or an absolute risk reduction from 5% to 3%) in the primary endpoint. Although a 10/3 mm Hg reduction in BP is substantial, it may not suffice to achieve a 40% reduction in CVD or renal failure. Additionally, the patients were followed for only two years, and the main treatment drug was a long-acting calcium channel blocker (CCB). Diuretics, widely considered first-line treatment along with CCBs in most professional society guidelines, were used in only 12% of the patients. Further subgroup analysis, while not reaching statistical significance, suggested that intensive treatment goals may be beneficial in certain populations.

### Potential cardiovascular disease events prevented with adoption of the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association blood pressure guideline [^114REJzc]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Over 10 years, achieving and maintaining 2017 ACC/AHA guideline goals could prevent 3.0 million (UR, 1.1–5.1 million), 0.5 million (UR, 0.2–0.7 million), and 1.4 million (UR, 0.6–2.0 million) cardiovascular disease (CVD) events compared with maintaining blood pressure (BP) levels, achieving 2003 Seventh Joint National Committee Report goals, and achieving 2014 Eighth Joint National Committee goals, respectively. We estimated the number of cardiovascular disease events prevented and treatment-related serious adverse events incurred over 10 years among US adults with hypertension by achieving 2017 ACC/AHA guideline-recommended BP goals compared with (1) BP levels, (2) achieving 2003 Seventh Joint National Committee Report BP goals, and (3) achieving 2014 Eighth Joint National Committee panel member report BP goals.

- **Methods**: US adults aged ≥ 45 years with an indication for BP treatment were grouped according to recommendations for antihypertensive drug therapy in the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline, 2003 Seventh Joint National Committee Report, and 2014 Eighth Joint National Committee. Population sizes were estimated from the 2011 to 2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys. Rates for fatal and nonfatal CVD events (stroke, coronary heart disease, or heart failure) were estimated from the REGARDS (REasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke) study, weighted to the US population. CVD risk reductions with treatment to BP goals and risk for serious adverse events were obtained from meta-analyses of BP-lowering trials.

The Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) guidelines on hypertension have generated great interest among physicians. These guidelines differ from those published in 2003 (the JNC 7) in several aspects: the document format, blood-pressure cut-off values, and recommendations for antihypertensive drug use. The JNC 8 guidelines have some limitations that could affect clinical practice.

### Reducing the blood pressure-related burden of cardiovascular disease: Impact of achievable improvements in blood pressure prevention and control [^117XnbgU]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

In conclusion, population-wide reductions in systolic blood pressure (SBP) of modest magnitude are predicted to have a substantial impact on cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention and should be developed in parallel with interventions targeted to populations with blood pressure above goal. As advocated by many primary prevention statements, the management of blood pressure in adults should not be limited to those classified as hypertensive, but rather extend to the majority of the populations below hypertension treatment thresholds. Omitting such individuals leaves a large segment of the population at increased risk of cardiovascular events and constrains the ability of clinicians and public health practitioners to reduce the societal burden of blood pressure-related coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, and heart failure (HF).

### Clinical diagnosis and management of hypertension compared with the Joint National Committee 8 panelists' recommendations [^117QEfHc]. Clinical Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

The panelists of the Joint National Committee recently published new recommendations for the management of hypertension. Our study aims to evaluate how practice compares.

- **Hypothesis**: Practice likely deviates from the recent JNC 8 panelists' recommendations.

- **Methods**: A survey was sent to cardiology providers at three academic medical centers: Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida; Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, Arizona; and Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota. Providers were asked to select which blood pressure goal would be deemed appropriate in various cases based on individual practice in both the maintenance of patients already on therapy as well as the threshold of when to initiate therapy. Comparisons with recommendations were made, considering geographic location and level of experience.

- **Results**: A total of 251 survey requests were sent (May 2014), and 77 responses (30.7%) were received. Cardiologists tended not to practice according to the new guidelines, with most variation seen in patients age > 60 years without comorbidities on active treatment. Providers' selection of initial pharmacologic agents in non-African American patients, African American patients, and patients with diabetes mellitus reflected congruency with guidelines.

- **Conclusions**: Our study found that clinical practice does not correlate well with the new blood pressure goal recommendations published by the Joint National Committee 8 panelists, particularly in patients age > 60 years. Practitioners are likely to follow the recommendations regarding pharmacologic management.

### The goal of blood pressure in the hypertensive patient with diabetes is defined: Now the challenge is go from recommendations to practice [^111N7adM]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2014). Low credibility.

High blood pressure (BP) is the leading cause of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and deaths globally, associated with 7.5 million deaths (representing one-eighth of all deaths) per year worldwide. The importance of BP as a modifiable risk factor for CVD is well recognized, and many effective and inexpensive BP-lowering treatments are commonly available. Therefore, BP control and prevention of related morbidity and mortality are clearly achievable. However, the awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension are low in all countries, despite hypertension being an easily detectable, common, and well-established risk factor for CVD.

The reasons for the persisting gap in awareness and treatment of hypertension, despite the prioritization of blood pressure identification and control by many national and global organizations and the availability of cheap and effective medications, remain unclear. The use of combination therapies, which is needed to control hypertension, is relatively uncommon even in wealthier countries. Although once hypertension is detected, 80% of individuals are on pharmacologic therapy, only a minority achieve control. This suggests the need for a more aggressive approach to BP control, for example by using combination therapies.

A recent study using a meticulous algorithm applied to patients with diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2) was able to lower BP; however, more than half of the patients did not achieve the American Diabetes Association (ADA)/Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure: The Seventh Report (JNC 7) targets, demonstrating the complexity of BP control in this population.

### US hypertension management guidelines: A review of the recent past and recommendations for the future [^114ZYgAP]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

A recent cost-effectiveness model of treating stage I hypertension showed a reduction in both cardiovascular disease (CVD) events and deaths, along with significant cost savings, especially in those over 60 years old. This study used the JNC 8 panel's recommended treatment targets but did not model the cost savings or mortality benefit of treating adults over 60 years with systolic blood pressure (SBP) 140 to 150 mm Hg. However, there were significant cost savings gained from treating men and women between the ages of 45 and 60 with blood pressure over 140/90 mm Hg. Given the projected increase in CVD events with those over 60 years of age, we believe that there is likely to be a benefit to treating mild hypertension in this group as well.

- **Impact of adopting the JNC 8 guidelines**: The adoption of the JNC 8 guidelines on a population level will lead to a significant change in those eligible for blood pressure treatment. While an estimated 41.5 million people are above their BP goal under JNC 7, only 28 million are above goal according to the JNC 8 recommendations. This is based on estimates from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a representative population sample. This corresponds to 13.5 million adults, with the majority aged 60 and older, who were previously considered above goal and now no longer eligible for further treatment. An important consideration is that these 13.5 million include 37% with diabetes, 39% with chronic kidney disease (CKD), and 19% with CVD.

- **Confirmation from the National Cardiovascular Data Registry**: The National Cardiovascular Data Registry PINNACLE Registry confirmed that the population of patients for whom the BP goals changed in JNC 8 is also the population who are at the highest risk for CVD events. This population has an average Framingham risk score.

### Blood pressure targets for the treatment of people with hypertension and cardiovascular disease [^1135WgQD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). High credibility.

Hypertension is a prominent preventable cause of premature morbidity and mortality. People with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease are at particularly high risk, so reducing blood pressure below standard targets may be beneficial. This strategy could reduce cardiovascular mortality and morbidity but could also increase adverse events. The optimal blood pressure target in people with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease remains unknown.

- **Objectives**: To determine if 'lower' blood pressure targets (≤ 135/85 mmHg) are associated with reduction in mortality and morbidity compared with 'standard' blood pressure targets (≤ 140 to 160/90 to 100 mmHg) in the treatment of people with hypertension and a history of cardiovascular disease, including myocardial infarction, angina, stroke, and peripheral vascular occlusive disease.

- **Search methods**: The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials up to February 2017: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also searched the Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Literature Database (from 1982) and contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work. There were no language restrictions.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with more than 50 participants per trial.

### Frequency and prognosis of treated hypertensive patients according to prior and new blood pressure goals [^117RjvnT]. Hypertension (2019). Low credibility.

United States and European guidelines have recommended new treatment goals for office blood pressure (BP). We examined 9,784 hypertensives from the Spanish Ambulatory BP Monitoring (ABPM) registry with office BP treated to the prior goal (< 140/90 mmHg) and evaluated the frequency and all-cause mortality of four BP strata. This evaluation depended on whether or not patients attained more conservative or new office BP goals (130–139/80–89 and < 130/80 mmHg, respectively), and whether or not BP was controlled according to ABPM criteria in the European and US guidelines (24-hour ambulatory BP < 130/80 and < 125/75 mmHg, respectively).

Whether achieving the new office BP goal or not, the total-mortality risk during a 5-year follow-up was only significantly higher than the reference (normal office BP and ABPM) when 24-hour ambulatory BP was above goal. The hazard ratio from multivariable Cox models was in the range of 2.4–2.9 (P < 0.001). The frequency of patients achieving the new office BP goal was 34.4%, and the frequencies of those not achieving the ABPM goal were 31.6% and 53.7% using the 130/80 or the 125/75 ABPM goal, respectively. Mean office systolic BP was 129 mmHg for patients not achieving the ABPM goal. In hypertensive patients controlled under the prior office BP goal, the frequency of those achieving the new office BP goal < 130/80 was high, suggesting this goal can be attained. Additionally, patients had a higher mortality risk only when ABPM was above goal despite having mean office systolic BP under control, a condition that was also common.

### Goal-oriented hypertension management: translating clinical trials to practice [^111SBxMe]. Hypertension (2002). Low credibility.

Several clinical trials using a blood pressure (BP) treatment algorithm focused on a predetermined goal have achieved better control rates than those of national survey data. These trials reached the Sixth Joint National Committee on the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC VI) diastolic blood pressure (DBP) goal of 90% of volunteers and systolic blood pressure (SBP) goal of 60% of volunteers. We evaluated BP control of 437 consecutive patients after at least one year of follow-up in a specialist clinic, which employed "goal-oriented management", i.e. treating to a specific BP goal without a formal drug treatment algorithm, to determine whether JNC VI goals could be achieved.

Overall, 276 (63%) patients achieved the SBP goal, with 376 (86%) at the DBP goal and 358 (59%) at both goals. Only 23% of patients were on monotherapy, with 34% requiring two drugs and 37% requiring three or more medications. There was no substantial difference in BP control rates among age, gender, and ethnicity subgroups. However, in the 20% of patients who were diabetic, only 52% had a BP of < 140 mm Hg and < 90 mm Hg, whereas fewer (22% and 15%, respectively) achieved the more stringent goals of JNC VI and the American Diabetic Association (ADA)/National Kidney Foundation (NKF).

Goal-oriented management achieved dramatically better control rates than what is reported. Although DBP control was easy to achieve, achieving the SBP goal still remained difficult. Employing goal-oriented management can translate BP control results achieved in clinical trials.

### Attainment of NICE blood pressure targets among older people with newly diagnosed hypertension: Nationwide linked electronic health records cohort study [^1158tRLr]. Age and Ageing (2023). High credibility.

It is not known if clinical practice reflects guideline recommendations for the management of hypertension in older people and whether guideline adherence varies according to overall health status. The aim of this study was to describe the proportion of older people attaining National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline blood pressure targets within one year of hypertension diagnosis and determine predictors of target attainment.

This nationwide cohort study utilized Welsh primary care data from the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage databank, including patients aged 65 years and older who were newly diagnosed with hypertension between 1st June 2011 and 1st June 2016. The primary outcome was the attainment of NICE guideline blood pressure targets, as measured by the latest blood pressure recording up to one year after diagnosis. Predictors of target attainment were investigated using logistic regression.

The results included 26,392 patients (55% women, median age 71, interquartile range 68–77 years), with 13,939 (52.8%) attaining target blood pressure within a median follow-up of 9 months. Success in attaining the target blood pressure was associated with a history of atrial fibrillation (OR 1.26, 95% CI 1.11, 1.43), heart failure (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.06, 1.49), and myocardial infarction (OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.10, 1.32), compared to no history of each condition, respectively. Care home residence, the severity of frailty, and increasing co-morbidity were not associated with target attainment following adjustment for confounder variables. Blood pressure remains insufficiently controlled in this population.

### Role of angiotensin receptor blockers as monotherapy in reaching blood pressure goals [^113a4Wtd]. American Journal of Hypertension (2005). Low credibility.

The Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure emphasizes the urgent need to lower blood pressure (BP) to a goal of < 140/90 mm Hg in patients with uncomplicated hypertension and to < 130/80 mm Hg in high-risk patients, such as those with diabetes mellitus or chronic kidney disease, to prevent cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality. Consequently, a meaningful measure of the efficacy of an antihypertensive therapy is its ability to achieve BP reduction to below the recommended BP goals.

Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) are highly effective antihypertensive agents with excellent tolerability profiles similar to those of placebo. A literature search using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and BIOSIS to identify studies reporting data on the percentage of patients attaining BP goals found that monotherapy with an ARB can generally result in the attainment of the diastolic BP (DBP) goal of < 90 mm Hg in approximately 50% of hypertensive patients. However, to our knowledge, the attainment of the systolic BP (SBP) and combined SBP/DBP goals with ARB monotherapy has not been reported.

Therefore, a secondary analysis of BP efficacy data from a published study that directly compared recommended starting doses of four currently marketed ARBs was performed to assess combined SBP and DBP goal attainment. This analysis showed that the percentage of patients achieving the combined SBP/DBP goal rate of < 140/90 mm Hg was highest with olmesartan medoxomil (32.4%) compared with recommended starting doses of losartan.

### Reducing the blood pressure-related burden of cardiovascular disease: Impact of achievable improvements in blood pressure prevention and control [^117Fqb4M]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

The large cardioprotective benefits associated with the medical management of blood pressure led earlier studies to evaluate the hypothetical impact of 100% elimination of hypertension on the incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) through metrics like the population‐attributable fraction. For reference, our results suggested that if 100% of aware and treated blood pressure above goal was controlled among African American and whites aged 45 to 64 years, approximately 20,154 coronary heart disease (CHD) events could be prevented annually in the United States, consistent with recently published estimates using the JNC 8 guidelines.

Despite considerable clinical and public health efforts to improve hypertension management, no historical precedent is available for achieving 100% control; instead, nationally representative estimates suggested that approximately 43.5% of adults with treatment‐eligible hypertension are not treated to goal. As an alternative, we estimated event reductions achieved by modest, but plausible decreases in the proportion of the population classified as having unaware, untreated, and uncontrolled blood pressure above goal. As expected, full implementation of interventions that achieved 10% changes in unaware, untreated, and uncontrolled blood pressure above goal were estimated to prevent considerably fewer CVD events than fully implemented interventions assuming 100% elimination of blood pressure above goal. This discrepancy reflects the proportion of the population for whom we assume a successful intervention. For example, in a population of 100,000 with a prevalence of blood pressure above goal at 20%, composed of…

### The recommendations of a consensus panel for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and associated supine hypertension [^116SXSde]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

- **Supine hypertension**: According to the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC8) hypertension guidelines, essential hypertension is a blood pressure consistently ≥ 140/90 mmHg. Supine hypertension in nOH patients is arbitrarily defined as a systolic blood pressure ≥ 150 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mmHg while in the supine position. General treatment guidelines recommend intervention for hypertension, but supine hypertension associated with nOH requires additional considerations. In patients with autonomic failure causing nOH, supine hypertension is common and part of the underlying disease process since these patients lack the normal blood pressure buffering mechanisms that offset hypertension. In addition, frequent periods of OH may lead to chronic activation of the renin–angiotensin system.

A supine systolic blood pressure of up to 160 mmHg should be monitored but does not generally warrant treatment, especially if the symptoms of nOH have improved. The long-term risks associated with supine hypertension need to be balanced with the short-term risks of OH. Expert recommendations for the management of supine hypertension in the setting of nOH suggest that supine hypertension requires intervention if systolic blood pressure exceeds the range of 160–180 mmHg. However, it should be noted that individuals with the largest drops in blood pressure upon standing (> 80 mmHg drop) will require significantly higher supine blood pressures in order to achieve a standing position, and therefore permissive supine hypertension may be necessary.

### US hypertension management guidelines: A review of the recent past and recommendations for the future [^111USxYQ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

BP targets in CKD patients were also increased from < 130/80 to < 140/90 mm Hg between the JNC 7 and JNC 8 guidelines. While the JNC 8 panel did not incorporate proteinuria as an outcome of interest, the ASH/ISH, the ESH/ESC, and the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) group all make a distinction between CKD patients based on proteinuria status, with a lower BP goal of < 130/80 to 90 mm Hg for those with proteinuria detectable on urinalysis.

The International Society on Hypertension in Blacks also recommends a target of < 130/80 mm Hg for black adults with CKD. The evidence for these recommendations is based on three trials — the African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension (AASK), the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) study, and the Blood-pressure Control for Renoprotection in Patients with Non-diabetic Chronic Renal Disease (REIN-2) study. None of these trials showed a difference in kidney or CVD outcomes between those with lower versus higher BP goals.

AASK (N = 1094) evaluated mean arterial pressure (MAP) goals, targeting 102 to 107 mm Hg in the usual-BP group versus ≤ 92 mm Hg in the lower-BP group. While the lower-BP group achieved an average BP of 128/78 mm Hg, compared with 141/85 mm Hg in the other group, there was no significant change in the rate of glomerular filtration rate decline, end-stage renal disease, or death. There was, however, a decrease in proteinuria in the strict treatment group at 6 months (17% decrease versus 7% increase), and this effect persisted throughout the length.

### 2024 ESC guidelines for the management of elevated blood pressure and hypertension [^11487iFx]. European Heart Journal (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for chronic kidney disease, particularly in the context of hypertension management and blood pressure targets, the ESC 2024 guidelines recommend targeting systolic blood pressure (SBP) levels between 120–129 mmHg, if tolerated. This is advised for adult patients with moderate-to-severe chronic kidney disease (CKD) who are receiving blood pressure-lowering drugs and have an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) greater than 30 mL/min/1.73 m².

### Treating to hypertension targets [^114brLRV]. Heart (2004). Low credibility.

Control of blood pressure levels in hypertensive patients often fails to meet the targets suggested by the British Hypertension Society (BHS) guidelines. The optimal treatment target for non-diabetic patients is ≤ 140/85 mm Hg. Data from the health survey for England show that in 1998, only 8% of men and 11% of women had blood pressure controlled to < 140/90 mm Hg. The Anglo-Scandinavian cardiac outcomes trial (ASCOT) data show that 87% of non-diabetic patients at the St Mary's Centre are currently treated to below 140/90 mm Hg. These differences can be explained by strict protocol adherence, a focus on cardiovascular disease, longer consultation times and punctual appointments, reinforcement of non-pharmacological advice, and blood pressure readings taken in line with BHS guidelines. Some of these points might be translated into the more challenging setting of primary care.

### Debate on the 2025 guideline for the prevention, detection, evaluation, and management of high blood pressure in adults: New blood pressure targets, lower is better-and possible [^117CAWRS]. Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Joint Committee on Clinical Practice Guidelines has released the long-awaited 2025 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology/AANP/AAPA/ABC/ACCP/ACPM/AGS/AMA/ASPC/NMA/PCNA/SGIM guideline for the prevention, detection, evaluation, and management of high blood pressure in adults. Since the previous version, which had been in place for eight years, meta-analyses and several treat-to-target trials investigating lower versus standard blood pressure targets have been published. Based on these findings, the 2025 guideline from the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association recommends, in adults with confirmed hypertension, an office blood pressure goal of < 130/80 mmHg, with encouragement to further reduce systolic blood pressure to < 120 mmHg. Here, we set out why we support these lower blood pressure targets and outline strategies to achieve them.

### Reconciling systolic blood pressure intervention trial with eighth joint national commission: a nuanced view of optimal hypertension control in the chronic kidney disease population [^11423mf9]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2022). High credibility.

Universally lowering blood pressure (BP) may adversely affect some populations, especially in the older population. Recent landmark trials have revealed cardiovascular benefits of tight controlling systolic BP (SBP) more than several recent BP targets. Implementing the evidence from the studies and guidelines in some populations is reviewed.

- **Recent findings**: The Eighth Joint National Commission (JNC-8) on hypertension issued conservative guidelines that provided an evolutionary change to BP control in the elderly. However, intensive BP control with SBP < 120 mmHg in the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) focuses on the improvement of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular outcomes. Although guidelines are increasingly trending toward the SPRINT results, it is noteworthy that not all populations show a favorable outcome with intensive BP control, given hypotensive risks to memory, kidney function, orthostasis, and morbidity risks.

- **Summary**: Some populations may benefit from implementing the more intensive SBP target, whereas others, such as elderly hypertensive patients, may benefit from a more liberal SBP target. In the spirit of 'Primum non nocere', we call for and suggest that a marriage of both SPRINT and JNC-8 recommendations be undertaken to champion the most cardiovascular protections for the greatest number of patients possible, while preventing complications in vulnerable populations such as the elderly. Among the chronic kidney disease (CKD) population, SBP < 120 mmHg may not necessarily lead to favorable CKD outcomes.

### Blood pressure goals in patients with CKD: A review of evidence and guidelines [^112u6U1C]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2019). High credibility.

Hypertension affects the vast majority of patients with CKD and increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, ESKD, and death. Over the past decade, a number of hypertension guidelines have been published with varying recommendations for BP goals in patients with CKD. Most recently, the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association 2017 hypertension guidelines set a BP goal of < 130/80 mm Hg for patients with CKD and others at elevated cardiovascular risk. These guidelines were heavily influenced by the landmark Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT), which documented that an intensive BP goal to a systolic BP < 120 mm Hg decreased the risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality in nondiabetic adults at high cardiovascular risk, many of whom had CKD; the intensive BP goal did not retard CKD progression. It is noteworthy that SPRINT measured BP with automated devices (5-minute wait period, average of three readings) often without observers, a technique that potentially results in BP values that are lower than what is typically measured in the office. Still, results from SPRINT, along with long-term follow-up data from the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease and the African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension, suggest that a BP goal < 130/80 mm Hg will reduce mortality in patients with CKD. Unfortunately, data are more limited in patients with diabetes or stage 4–5 CKD. Increased adverse events, including electrolyte abnormalities and decreased eGFR, necessitate careful laboratory monitoring. In conclusion, a BP goal of < 130/80 is a reason

Regarding classification and risk stratification for hypertension, particularly in relation to cardiovascular risk stratification, the ESC 2024 guidelines recommend using a risk-based approach in the treatment of elevated blood pressure. These guidelines recognize that patients with moderate or severe chronic kidney disease (CKD), established cardiovascular disease (CVD), hypertension-mediated organ damage, diabetes mellitus, and familial hypercholesterolemia are at increased risk for cardiovascular events.

### Hypertension management algorithm for type 2 diabetic patients applied in primary care [^116TJuuC]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2013). Low credibility.

Hypertension frequently coexists with type 2 diabetes (DM) and increases the risk of cardiovascular outcomes. The aim of the study was to obtain or maintain blood pressure (BP) goals (ADA/JNC 7) according to a stepwise algorithm using the medication supplied by the Brazilian government.

- **Methods**: A one-year, single-arm interventional study was conducted with type 2 diabetes patients. The intervention consisted of intensification of lifestyle changes and sequential prescription of drugs, including diuretics, ACE inhibitors, β-adrenergic blocking agents, and calcium channel blocking agents if BP was greater than 130/80 mmHg.

- **Results**: Seventy-eight patients completed the trial. During the intervention, the number of antihypertensive tablets rose from 3.6 ± 3.5 to 5.9 ± 3.5 pills per patient (p < 0.001), as did the number of antihypertensive classes (1.8 ± 1.0 vs. 2.70 ± 1.2; p < 0.01). The overall drop in BP was 11 mmHg for SBP (145.0 ± 22.8 vs. 133.7 ± 20.9 mmHg; p < 0.01) and 5 mmHg for DBP (78.7 ± 11.5 vs. 73.7 ± 10.5 mmHg; p = 0.001). Although the number of patients with BP in the target range almost doubled [14 (18.7%) vs. 30 (38.5%); p = 0.008], less than 40% of the patients achieved the proposed goals.

- **Conclusions**: A BP algorithm applied to type 2 diabetic and hypertensive patients is able to lower BP. However, more than half of the patients did not achieve the ADA/JNC 7 targets, demonstrating the complexity of BP control in this population.

- **Trial registration**: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT06260.

### Cardiovascular guidelines: Separate career may help attenuate controversy [^1136g9nL]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2014). Low credibility.

The JNC8 hypertension guidelines highlight that only about half of patients with hypertension in the United States have a systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 140 mm Hg or less. The Joint National Committee (JNC7) Guidelines, released more than a decade ago, concluded that all adult patients with hypertension, regardless of age, should have their BP reduced to an SBP of lower than 140 mm Hg. Even tighter control was recommended for patients with diabetes or renal disease (SBP < 130 mmHg).

In contrast, the new recommendations raise target SBP goals to 150 mm Hg or lower in those aged 60 years or older, while eliminating the tighter control recommendations for patients with diabetes and renal disease. A minority of the panel disagreed with the recommendation to increase the target SBP from 140 to 150 mmHg in individuals aged 60 years or older without diabetes mellitus or chronic kidney disease. Intuitively, an estimated 13 million U.S. hypertensive patients aged 60 years or older would reduce pill intake with the SBP goal increase from 140 to 150 mmHg. Antihypertensive medication use may be associated with injurious falls in the elderly, with a 30% to 40% increased risk compared with no antihypertensive medication use.

Moreover, the results of the ACCORD MIND show that intensive management to a target SBP of less than 120 mm Hg, coupled with fibrate therapy in the context of LDL cholesterol level control, are not effective in reducing cognitive decline in persons with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes at high risk for cardiovascular disease.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for hypertension, specifically concerning alcohol restriction, the 2025 guidelines recommend advising adults with or without hypertension to pursue abstinence from alcohol or to reduce alcohol intake to ≤ 1 drink per day for women and ≤ 2 drinks per day for men to prevent or treat elevated blood pressure and hypertension.

### Blood pressure control in type 2 diabetic patients [^1166x5ob]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2017). Low credibility.

Although previous guidelines recommended strict blood pressure (BP) control in diabetic patients, this has been challenged in recent guidelines. The British National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines published in 2011 recommended commencing treatment in diabetic patients with stage 1 hypertension characterized by clinic BP > 140/90 mmHg and ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) daytime average or home BP monitoring (HBPM) average BP of > 135/85 mmHg.

The recently published 2016 American Diabetes Association (ADA) guidelines recommended that hypertensive diabetic patients be treated if they have a diastolic BP of > 80 mmHg or a systolic BP > 140 mmHg, with a target BP value of < 140/90 mmHg. These guidelines state that individuals in whom stroke risk is a concern may, as part of shared decision-making, have lower systolic targets such as 130 mmHg. This is especially true if lower BP can be achieved with few drugs and without side effects of therapy.

The American Heart Association (AHA)/American College of Cardiology (ACC) guidelines from 2014 recommend a target BP of < 140/90 mmHg but point out that lower targets may be considered. The American Society of Hypertension (ASH)/International Society of Hypertension (ISH) guidelines from 2014 suggest a BP goal of < 140/90 mmHg in diabetic patients. These values are lower than those recommended by the majority of the JNC 8 panel for non-diabetic patients aged 60–79, which was < 150/90 mmHg, yet similar to those recommended for non-diabetics aged 18–60 years.

### Level of blood pressure control and cardiovascular events: SPRINT criteria versus the 2014 hypertension recommendations [^114jQdks]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Blood pressure (BP) targets from the SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial) differ from targets of the 2014 hypertension (HTN) recommendations of the Eighth Joint National Committee.

- **Objectives**: The goal of this study was to estimate the proportion of hypertensive adults who would meet BP goals under the SPRINT criteria and the 2014 recommendations, and to determine related effects on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.

- **Methods**: We used data from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey of 2008 to 2013 (n = 13,346), as well as the Korean National Health Insurance Service health examinee cohort of 2007 (n = 67,965), to estimate the proportion of subjects meeting BP goals of each of the criteria. Using data from the Korean National Health Insurance Service health examinee cohort of 2007 (n = 67,965), we compared risks of major cardiovascular events (composite of nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes) associated with different BP control goals.

- **Results**: A substantially lower proportion of hypertensive adults met BP goals of the SPRINT criteria compared with the 2014 recommendations (11.9% vs. 70.8%, respectively). Ten-year predicted cardiovascular risks were lowest in the intensive control group (below SPRINT BP goals), intermediate in the less-intensive group (above SPRINT goals but below 2014 recommendation goals), and highest in the uncontrolled group (above 2014 recommendations) (6.15%, 7.65%, and 9.39%, respectively; p < 0.001).

### Hypertension management algorithm for type 2 diabetic patients applied in primary care [^116qbjvU]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2013). Low credibility.

Hypertension frequently coexists with type 2 diabetes (DM) and increases the risk of cardiovascular outcomes. The aim of the study was to obtain and maintain blood pressure (BP) goals (ADA/JNC 7) according to a stepwise algorithm using medication supplied by the Brazilian government.

- **Methods**: A one-year, single-arm interventional study was conducted with type 2 diabetes patients. The intervention consisted of intensifying lifestyle changes and the sequential prescription of drugs: diuretic; ACE inhibitors; β-adrenergic blocking agents; and calcium channel blocking agents if BP > 130/80 mmHg.

- **Results**: Seventy-eight patients completed the trial. During the intervention, the number of antihypertensive tablets rose (3.6 ± 3.5 vs. 5.9 ± 3.5 pills/patient; p < 0.001), as the number of antihypertensive classes increased (1.8 ± 1.0 vs. 2.70 ± 1.2; p < 0.01), and there was an overall drop in BP by 11 mmHg for SBP (145.0 ± 22.8 vs. 133.7 ± 20.9 mmHg; p < 0.01) and 5 mmHg for DBP (78.7 ± 11.5 vs. 73.7 ± 10.5 mmHg; p = 0.001). Although the number of patients with BP in target almost doubled [14 (18.7%) vs. 30 (38.5%); p = 0.008], less than 40% of the patients achieved the proposed goals.

- **Conclusions**: A BP algorithm applied to type 2 diabetic and hypertensive patients is able to lower BP; however, more than half of the patients did not achieve the ADA/JNC 7 targets, demonstrating the complexity of BP control in this population.

### US hypertension management guidelines: A review of the recent past and recommendations for the future [^111FQ8Fb]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). High credibility.

The VALISH (Valsartan in Elderly Isolated Systolic Hypertension) trial examined a slightly older hypertensive patient population (N = 3260), with a mean age of 76 years, comparing strict (< 140 mm Hg) and moderate (140 to < 150 mm Hg) SBP control strategies with valsartan as the first-line drug. There was a non-significant trend toward reduction of the primary outcome of composite CVD and renal disease with the intensive treatment strategy (10.6 versus 12.0 per 1000 patient-years; P = 0.38) at 3 years of follow-up.

An important consideration is that VALISH was significantly underpowered, with substantially fewer primary endpoint events than predicted. While VALISH was conducted in Japan, most guidelines for the elderly, African Americans, or Europeans would suggest that angiotensin type II receptor blockers (ARBs) are second line to a diuretic or CCB for controlling BP. In both of these trials, the treatment strategies were well tolerated with few adverse events.

One trial not included in the JNC 8 analysis was FEVER (Felodipine Event Reduction), which enrolled 9800 Chinese patients aged 50 to 79 years with hypertension and at least one other cardiovascular risk factor for a comparison of diuretic monotherapy versus diuretic plus CCB. Of note, this patient population had a higher rate of prior stroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA), suggesting a higher baseline risk for CVD, despite other baseline characteristics such as diabetes, previous MI, and incidence of cardiovascular events being in a similar range to those of other large studies.

### Blood pressure targets for the treatment of people with hypertension and cardiovascular disease [^113QhbJd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020).

This is the second update of the review first published in 2017. Hypertension is a prominent preventable cause of premature morbidity and mortality. People with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease are at particularly high risk, so reducing blood pressure to below standard targets may be beneficial. This strategy could reduce cardiovascular mortality and morbidity but could also increase adverse events. The optimal blood pressure target in people with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease remains unknown.

- **Objectives**: To determine if lower blood pressure targets (135/85 mmHg or less) are associated with a reduction in mortality and morbidity as compared with standard blood pressure targets (140 to 160/90 to 100 mmHg or less) in the treatment of people with hypertension and a history of cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, angina, stroke, peripheral vascular occlusive disease).

- **Search methods**: For this updated review, the Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) up to November 2019: Cochrane Hypertension Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), and Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) (from 1982), along with the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work. We applied no language restrictions.

### Impact of 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines on prevalence of hypertension and eligibility for antihypertensive treatment in United States and China: Nationally representative cross-sectional study [^115Q1SkB]. BMJ (2018). Low credibility.

- **Eligibility for antihypertensive treatment: China**: In China, based on JNC-8 blood pressure targets, 46.8% (43.4% to 50.3%) of the 184.2 (171.6 to 196.8) million people with hypertension were receiving one or more antihypertensive drugs. Among the 266.9 (252.9 to 280.8) million classified as having hypertension according to the 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines, 32.3% (30.0% to 34.7%) were receiving antihypertensive treatment.

	- The application of JNC-8 and 2017 ACC/AHA criteria for defining treatment eligibility would recommend starting treatment in 74.5 (64.1 to 84.8) million and 129.8 (118.7 to 140.9) million patients, respectively — an additional 55.3 million people. Those recommended for treatment under the new guidelines were more frequently women and had a history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

	- Furthermore, 23.4 (12.1 to 35.1) million people per JNC-8 and 51.0 (40.3 to 61.6) million under ACC/AHA guidelines would be classified as having hypertension and would qualify for lifestyle modifications alone. This group includes individuals with a systolic blood pressure of 130–139 mm Hg and/or a diastolic blood pressure of 80–89 mm Hg, without any high-risk conditions such as age 65 years or older, known atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, a 10-year predicted risk of at least 10% for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, or diabetes.

	- Finally, of those receiving antihypertensive treatment in China from 2011 to 2012, 41.4% (37.7% to 45.1%) were above the treatment targets for JNC-8 and 76.2% were above targets according to the new guidelines.

### Attainment of NICE blood pressure targets among older people with newly diagnosed hypertension: Nationwide linked electronic health records cohort study [^1172LUi8]. Age and Ageing (2023). High credibility.

It is not known if clinical practice reflects guideline recommendations for the management of hypertension in older people and whether guideline adherence varies according to overall health status.

- **Aims**: To describe the proportion of older people attaining National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline blood pressure targets within 1 year of hypertension diagnosis and determine predictors of target attainment.

- **Methods**: A nationwide cohort study of Welsh primary care data from the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage databank, including patients aged ≥ 65 years newly diagnosed with hypertension between 1st June 2011 and 1st June 2016. The primary outcome was the attainment of NICE guideline blood pressure targets as measured by the latest blood pressure recording up to 1 year after diagnosis. Predictors of target attainment were investigated using logistic regression.

- **Results**: There were 26,392 patients (55% women, median age 71 [IQR 68–77] years) included, of which 13,939 (52.8%) attained a target blood pressure within a median follow-up of 9 months. Success in attaining target blood pressure was associated with a history of atrial fibrillation (OR 1.26, 95% CI 1.11, 1.43), heart failure (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.06, 1.49), and myocardial infarction (OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.10, 1.32), all compared to no history of each, respectively. Care home residence, the severity of frailty, and increasing co-morbidity were not associated with target attainment following adjustment for confounder variables.

- **Conclusions**: Blood pressure remains insufficiently controlled.

### Pharmacologic treatment of hypertension in adults aged 60 years or older to higher versus lower blood pressure targets: A clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians and the American Academy of Family Physicians [^114J6U1P]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of hypertension, particularly concerning indications for treatment in the elderly, the 2017 guidelines from the American Academy of Family Physicians and the American College of Physicians recommend initiating treatment in adults aged 60 years or older with a systolic blood pressure (SBP) persistently at or above 150 mmHg. The goal is to achieve a target SBP of less than 150 mmHg in order to reduce the risk of mortality, stroke, and cardiac events.

### Effect of intensive structured care on individual blood pressure targets in primary care: Multicentre randomised controlled trial [^113YPJRN]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

Figure 3 illustrates the change in systolic and diastolic blood pressure according to individual blood pressure targets at randomisation (n = 1492). On an adjusted basis, participants assigned to the intervention were significantly more likely to achieve their target at the two higher blood pressure target levels.

- **Change in absolute cardiovascular risk**: Among the 1,141 participants in whom absolute cardiovascular risk profiles were calculated from baseline to 26 weeks' follow-up (i.e. complete data on profiling both before and after randomization), the intervention group had a significantly greater reduction in risk scores (14.7% (SD 9.3%) to 10.9% (SD 8.0%); −3.7% (SD 4.5%)) than the usual care group (15.0% (SD 10.1%) to 12.4% (SD 9.4%); −2.6% (SD 4.5%)). The adjusted mean reduction in risk was in favor of the intervention group (−1.13%, 95% confidence interval −0.69% to −1.63%). The prevalence of those with a high absolute risk of cardiovascular events (> 15%) in the intervention group decreased from 41.2% to 25.6%, while in the usual care group it decreased from 40.2% to 30.1%.

Hypertension (2018). High credibility.

The disease hypertension can be associated with a range of factors, including insulin, pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma, primary aldosteronism, and dyslipidemia. Physical signs such as third and fourth heart sounds, erectile dysfunction, and an increased systolic blood pressure (SBP) can also be indicators. Other associated conditions include aortic and cardiovascular diseases like aortic stenosis (AIS), premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), transient ischemic attack (TIA), carotid artery stenosis, hyperthyroidism, and hypertensive retinopathy.

Certain medications, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), NSAIDs, decongestants, corticosteroids, antipsychotics, and hormonal contraceptives, as well as lifestyle factors like alcohol consumption, obesity, and tobacco use, also play a role in hypertension. Additional health conditions linked to hypertension include Cushing's syndrome, coarctation of the aorta, fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD), glaucoma, hypermetropia, hyperparathyroidism, diabetes mellitus type 2, cardiac arrhythmias, chronic kidney disease (CKD), heart failure (HF), renal artery stenosis, depression treated with antidepressants, obstructive sleep apnea, and hypothyroidism.

Furthermore, hypertension is associated with both increased diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and conditions such as atrial fibrillation (AF), coronary artery disease, and peripheral artery disease (PAD).

### US hypertension management guidelines: A review of the recent past and recommendations for the future [^115z4TP1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

- **JNC 8 recommendations 2 to 5**: In all persons aged 18 years, including those younger or older than 60 years with either diabetes or CKD, it is recommended to initiate pharmacologic treatment to lower SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg. The goal BP is extended by JNC 8 for those aged 18 to 30 years. More support is found for DBP versus SBP goals among younger adults with hypertension, particularly in the Hypertension Optimal Treatment (HOT) trial. This trial randomized 18,790 hypertensive patients (aged 50 to 80 years) with baseline DBP 100 to 115 mm Hg into three groups based on target DBP ≤ 90 mm Hg, ≤ 85 mm Hg, or ≤ 80 mm Hg.

The main goal of this study was to assess the association between these three target DBPs and major CVD events, including nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, and cardiovascular death. There was little difference in event rates between the three groups, except that the rate of MI was reduced in the two lower DBP target groups compared with the DBP ≤ 90 mm Hg group. Further subgroup analyses of patients with diabetes demonstrated fewer major CVD events, fewer strokes, and reduced cardiovascular mortality in the lowest BP treatment target group, while those with prior CVD had a significant reduction in stroke across the three groups.

While all three groups in the HOT trial achieved a mean DBP < 90 mm Hg, the lowest risk of cardiovascular mortality was observed at 85.6 mm Hg, and the lowest rate of CVD was noted.

### 2014 evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adults: Report from the panel members appointed to the eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) [^114a8fUm]. JAMA (2014). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for diabetes mellitus type 2, specifically with respect to the management of hypertension and blood pressure targets, the JNC8 2014 guidelines recommend initiating pharmacologic treatment to lower systolic blood pressure (SBP) to less than 140 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) to less than 90 mmHg in adult patients with diabetes mellitus and an SBP of 140 mmHg or higher, or a DBP of 90 mmHg or higher.

### Harmonization of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association and European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension blood pressure/hypertension guidelines [^115syZP7]. European Heart Journal (2022). High credibility.

Both the ACC/AHA and ESC/ESH recommend lower blood pressure treatment targets compared with the goals advised in previous guidelines. The ACC/AHA suggests a systolic/diastolic blood pressure (SBP/DBP) of < 130/80 mm Hg as a general treatment target, if tolerated. For older adults (≥ 65 years), who are noninstitutionalized, ambulatory, and community dwelling, the target is SBP < 130 mm Hg, if tolerated. For older adults with a high burden of comorbidity and limited life expectancy, treatment decisions should be based on clinical judgment, patient preference, and a team-based assessment of risk/benefit.

The ESC/ESH recommends target ranges but recognizes that the optimal and tolerated targets for individuals will differ. The initial SBP/DBP target is < 140/90 mm Hg for all adults with hypertension. Provided the treatment is well tolerated, targeting to 130/80 mm Hg is recommended, with subsequent efforts to achieve a lower blood pressure in those 18 to 65 years of age.

An exception to the general rule is that the SBP target in adults with hypertension and chronic kidney disease (CKD) should be between < 140 to 130 mm Hg. The ESC/ESH advises against specifically targeting SBP to < 120 mm Hg for adults but acknowledges that this may be achieved in some treated patients without adverse effects.

A key emphasis, especially in older and frailer patients, is to tailor the treatment to achieve the best blood pressure possible within the target range while monitoring for adverse effects. The optimal diastolic blood pressure target is defined as 70 to 79 mm Hg for all patients, but the emphasis is on controlling SBP, even when DBP is below these levels, provided the treatment is well tolerated.
