## Question

Uti test

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about UTI testing. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and pretest probability because that drives whether testing is warranted. Then, I should verify which diagnostic tests are appropriate for which scenario and how to interpret them. Next, I will examine special populations and collection methods that change thresholds and reliability. After that, I need to consider emerging molecular diagnostics and their current limitations. Finally, I will integrate stewardship principles and synthesize a practical decision framework with clear takeaways.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and pretest probability, because testing without compatible symptoms risks overdiagnosis and overtreatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria, which is common and should not be treated except in select high-risk groups like pregnancy or certain urologic procedures [^ebb22780] [^579168d4]. In women with classic lower urinary tract symptoms and no vaginal discharge, the pretest probability is high enough that empiric therapy is reasonable without culture, whereas atypical symptoms or high-risk features warrant culture to guide therapy and resistance considerations [^212a7d11] [^d430b8bf]. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with stewardship guidance; yes, diagnostic stewardship explicitly advises against testing in nonspecific syndromes and emphasizes pretest probability to avoid misclassification of ASB as UTI [^c89f0cc7] [^75ad71ad].

> Next, I should review the role of urinalysis and dipstick testing, and I need to be careful not to overstate their standalone diagnostic value. Urinalysis can support the diagnosis when combined with symptoms, but it cannot replace culture for definitive diagnosis, and results must be interpreted in clinical context; pyuria supports infection but is neither sensitive nor specific enough alone, and absence of pyuria makes true UTI less likely in many settings [^f3ef8554] [^33829b7b]. Wait, let me verify performance characteristics; sensitivity and specificity vary by population, with nitrite positivity being more specific but less sensitive than leukocyte esterase, and a negative dipstick reduces the probability of UTI but does not exclude it when pretest probability is high [^997eb67a] [^dda1fedf]. I should double-check that recent data still show limited predictive value; indeed, combined urinalysis parameters improve rule-out performance but remain poor for rule-in, especially in older women, reinforcing the need for clinical correlation [^5cf23efe].

> I will now examine urine culture, the diagnostic gold standard, and I need to ensure I get the thresholds right because they differ by population and collection method. For adult women with uncomplicated cystitis, culture is often unnecessary; however, culture with susceptibilities is indicated for recurrent UTIs, treatment failure, atypical presentations, older adults, or suspected resistant organisms, and in males given higher likelihood of complicated disease [^d430b8bf] [^c0eb7011]. For children, I should confirm that catheterized or suprapubic specimens are required for accurate diagnosis; bagged specimens have high false-positive rates and should not be used to diagnose UTI, and the AAP supports a threshold of at least 50,000 CFU/mL of a single uropathogen with supportive urinalysis, with some guidance allowing lower thresholds in select contexts [^27a3e613] [^9270b858]. Hold on, I should verify the evolving consensus on colony counts; recent multidisciplinary work proposes lowering the traditional 10^5 CFU/mL threshold to 10^4 CFU/mL for research and clinical use, reflecting that significant bacteriuria can occur at lower counts in symptomatic patients, though this must be balanced against contamination risk and clinical context [^5fca69be] [^e04c5ca1].

> Let me consider special populations and collection nuances, because missteps here drive misclassification. In older adults, symptoms are often nonspecific and asymptomatic bacteriuria is prevalent, so I should avoid anchoring on positive cultures without compatible urinary symptoms; pyuria alone is not diagnostic of CA-UTI and should not trigger antibiotics in the absence of symptoms or systemic instability [^5b62bbce] [^ba41b2ee]. For catheterized patients, I should confirm that cultures should be obtained from the catheter port or after replacing the catheter rather than from the bag, and that lower quantitative thresholds apply; again, pyuria is not sufficient for diagnosis without symptoms or systemic features, and overtreatment of ASB is common and harmful [^75abfa04] [^f080f3f8]. In pregnancy, I need to ensure screening and treatment of ASB because of risks like pyelonephritis and preterm birth, so lower thresholds and proactive testing are appropriate despite general stewardship principles [^notfound].

> Next, I should review emerging molecular diagnostics, and I must be cautious not to jump to conclusions about replacing culture. PCR and multiplex panels can shorten time to pathogen identification and may detect low-level or fastidious organisms missed by culture, but they do not provide comprehensive susceptibility and may detect nonviable or colonizing bacteria, risking overtreatment if interpreted without clinical context [^71074586] [^804efb28]. Wait, let me verify regulatory status and guideline positions; currently, there are no FDA-cleared rapid molecular tests for direct urine UTI diagnosis in the U.S., and professional societies advise that these tools complement, not replace, clinical judgment and culture-based stewardship pathways pending stronger evidence [^7477bf48] [^d0fc31ab]. I should confirm that ongoing studies suggest potential to reduce empiric therapy and improve outcomes, but high-quality, prospective data are still limited and heterogeneous, so selective, protocolized use is prudent [^d0fc31ab] [^71074586].

> I need to ensure I integrate diagnostic stewardship principles throughout, because misinterpretation of urine tests is a major driver of inappropriate antibiotics. Reflex culture algorithms tied to pyuria thresholds can reduce unnecessary cultures and antibiotics, but thresholds must be tailored to local epidemiology and special populations, and clinicians should be educated to avoid testing in the absence of urinary symptoms or when ASB is likely [^579168d4] [^33829b7b]. Hold on, I should verify that stewardship also extends to reporting; cascade reporting of organism ID and susceptibilities, with clinical comments to discourage treating ASB, improves alignment with best practices and reduces harm [^c89f0cc7] [^579168d4].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework, and I will double-check that it aligns with guidelines and evidence. For women with classic acute cystitis symptoms and no red flags, empiric therapy without culture is reasonable; if symptoms recur, fail first-line therapy, are atypical, or if the patient is older or has resistant isolates, obtain a culture with susceptibilities to guide therapy [^212a7d11] [^d430b8bf]. For children, always obtain a catheterized or suprapubic specimen for culture and urinalysis before antibiotics when UTI is suspected, interpret results using age-appropriate thresholds, and avoid bagged specimens for diagnosis; document pyuria and bacteriuria together to support a true UTI [^27a3e613] [^9270b858]. For older adults or catheterized patients, avoid testing in the absence of urinary symptoms; if CA-UTI is suspected, obtain appropriate cultures and treat only when symptoms and systemic features are present, recognizing that pyuria alone is insufficient [^ba41b2ee] [^f080f3f8]. Across all settings, avoid treating asymptomatic bacteriuria except in defined exceptions, and use clinical judgment to override misleading test results when the pretest probability and clinical course do not fit [^ebb22780] [^330ad9bb].

> Finally, I should confirm key takeaways and correct any overstatements. First, no single test reliably diagnoses or excludes UTI in all contexts; diagnosis requires integration of symptoms, urinalysis, and culture with attention to collection method and patient population [^33829b7b] [^f3ef8554]. Second, urinalysis and dipsticks are useful screening tools but have limited standalone accuracy, especially in older adults or those with low pretest probability, so results must be interpreted with clinical context [^5cf23efe] [^997eb67a]. Third, culture remains the diagnostic gold standard, but thresholds vary by population and specimen type, and emerging evidence supports lower quantitative cutoffs in symptomatic patients while maintaining vigilance for contamination [^5fca69be] [^e04c5ca1]. Fourth, molecular diagnostics are promising but not yet ready to replace culture-based pathways broadly; use them selectively within stewardship frameworks while evidence matures [^7477bf48] [^d0fc31ab]. Fifth, diagnostic stewardship is essential to reduce overdiagnosis of ASB and overtreatment, improving outcomes and antimicrobial resistance without compromising missed infections when pretest probability is high [^579168d4] [^c89f0cc7].

UTI testing should be **symptom-driven** and tailored to the clinical context [^c89f0cc7]. For uncomplicated cystitis in women with classic symptoms, **empiric treatment without culture is appropriate** [^212a7d11]; obtain urinalysis and culture if symptoms are atypical, severe, recurrent, or in pregnancy, pediatrics, or immunocompromised patients [^d430b8bf] [^f3ef8554]. Urinalysis with microscopy is a rapid screen for pyuria and bacteriuria, but **culture remains the gold standard** for definitive diagnosis and susceptibility [^51acec5c] [^f3ef8554]. Avoid testing in asymptomatic patients unless indicated (e.g. pregnancy), and use diagnostic stewardship to prevent overtreatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria [^ebb22780] [^579168d4]. Emerging molecular tests can expedite pathogen detection but are not yet replacements for culture in routine care [^7477bf48] [^d0fc31ab].

---

## Clinical indications for UTI testing

UTI testing is indicated based on **clinical presentation, patient population, and risk factors**:

- **Uncomplicated cystitis**: Empiric treatment without culture is appropriate for women with classic symptoms (dysuria, frequency, urgency) and no vaginal discharge [^212a7d11] [^69f26821].

- **Complicated UTI**: Obtain urinalysis and culture in men, pregnant patients, immunocompromised patients, those with recurrent UTIs, treatment failure, or atypical presentations [^d430b8bf] [^c0eb7011].

- **Asymptomatic bacteriuria**: Test only in pregnancy or before urologic procedures; avoid routine screening in nonpregnant, asymptomatic adults [^ebb22780].

---

## Common UTI diagnostic tests

| **Test** | **Description** | **Clinical utility** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Urinalysis (dipstick) | Rapid screen for leukocyte esterase, nitrites, protein, blood | Useful initial test; high sensitivity for pyuria; nitrites suggest gram-negative pathogens | False positives/negatives; not definitive; interpret with symptoms [^997eb67a] [^33829b7b] |
| Microscopic urinalysis | Visual assessment of WBCs, RBCs, bacteria | Detects pyuria/bacteriuria; supports diagnosis | Operator-dependent; not definitive [^notfound] |
| Urine culture | Gold standard; quantifies bacteria and provides susceptibilities | Definitive diagnosis; guides therapy | 24–48 h turnaround; contamination risk [^51acec5c] [^8dd1ee01] |
| Molecular diagnostics (PCR) | Rapid pathogen detection from urine | Faster results; detects low-level or fastidious organisms | Limited availability; not yet standard of care; may detect colonization [^7477bf48] [^71074586] |

---

## Interpretation of test results

Interpretation depends on **clinical context and patient population**:

- **Uncomplicated cystitis**: Classic symptoms plus pyuria/bacteriuria support diagnosis; culture not routinely required [^212a7d11] [^69f26821].

- **Complicated UTI**: Culture with ≥ 10^5 CFU/mL of a single organism, plus pyuria, confirms UTI; lower thresholds may apply in special populations [^5fca69be] [^7477bf48].

- **Asymptomatic bacteriuria**: ≥ 10^5 CFU/mL without symptoms; do not treat except in pregnancy or before urologic procedures [^ebb22780].

---

## Special populations and considerations

- **Pregnancy**: Screen and treat asymptomatic bacteriuria to prevent pyelonephritis and preterm birth [^notfound].

- **Pediatrics**: Use catheterized or suprapubic samples; bagged specimens are unreliable due to contamination [^27a3e613] [^f36c2ed5].

- **Elderly**: Symptoms are often nonspecific; avoid overdiagnosis and overtreatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria [^5b62bbce] [^c89f0cc7].

---

## Limitations and challenges

- **Contamination**: Poor collection leads to false positives; use midstream clean-catch or catheterized samples [^51acec5c] [^27a3e613].

- **Delay**: Culture turnaround delays therapy; empiric treatment is often necessary [^8dd1ee01].

- **Resistance**: Rising resistance complicates empiric therapy; culture guides targeted therapy [^6977ed72] [^c0eb7011].

---

## Emerging technologies

Molecular diagnostics (PCR, next-generation sequencing) offer **rapid, sensitive pathogen detection** and may reduce unnecessary antibiotics, but evidence is limited and they are not yet standard of care [^7477bf48] [^d0fc31ab].

---

UTI testing should be **symptom-driven**, with urinalysis as a rapid screen and culture for definitive diagnosis when indicated. Use diagnostic stewardship to avoid overtreatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria, and consider molecular tests selectively where available [^c89f0cc7] [^7477bf48].

### Novel technologies for the diagnosis of urinary tract infections [^4e0072e9]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) impose a substantial burden on patient quality of life and urine testing accounts for the majority of workload in many clinical microbiology laboratories. Traditional UTI diagnosis relies on symptoms, urinalysis, and culture which are interpreted based on historical guidelines. This approach, while foundational, presents limitations, particularly in complex cases. Low-level bacteriuria and the presence of fastidious organisms are often overlooked or entirely missed in standard urine culture, stressing the need for novel diagnostic methods and technologies. This mini-review summarizes the existing state of UTI diagnostics in 2024 and covers current and upcoming technologies including rapid molecular-based pathogen identification, next-generation sequencing, and advanced antimicrobial susceptibility testing. However, these methods represent unique challenges, and as they are implemented, they will require the field to adapt to new concepts to avoid misdiagnosis and overtreatment.

### Urine trouble: should we think differently about UTI? [^b8771610]. International Urogynecology Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is clinically important, given that it is one of the most common bacterial infections in adult women. However, the current understanding of UTI remains based on a now disproven concept that the urinary bladder is sterile. Thus, current standards for UTI diagnosis have significant limitations that may reduce the opportunity to improve patient care. Using data from our work and numerous other peer-reviewed studies, we identified four major limitations to the contemporary UTI description: the language of UTI, UTI diagnostic testing, the Escherichia coli-centric view of UTI, and the colony-forming units (CFU) threshold-based diagnosis. Contemporary methods and technology, combined with continued rigorous clinical research can be used to correct these limitations.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common bacterial infections in the United States and are a major driver of antibiotic use, both appropriate and inappropriate, across healthcare settings. Novel UTI diagnostics are a strategy that might enable better UTI treatment. Members of the Antibacterial Resistance Leadership Group Laboratory Center and the Infectious Diseases Society of America Diagnostics Committee convened to envision ideal future UTI diagnostics, with a view towards improving delivery of healthcare, patient outcomes and experiences, and antibiotic use, addressing which types of UTI diagnostics are needed and how companies might approach development of novel UTI diagnostics.

### Rapid tests and urine sampling techniques for the diagnosis of urinary tract infection (UTI) in children under five years: a systematic review [^17668b70]. BMC Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Methods

We searched 16 electronic databases from inception to between October 2002 and February 2003. Update searches were conducted in May 2004. To identify additional published and unpublished studies we searched the internet, hand searched 12 key journals, screened reference lists of included papers and contacted experts in the field.

We did not apply any language restrictions. Full details of the search strategy will be reported elsewhere.

Studies had to meet the following criteria to be included in the review:

Study design: diagnostic cohort (single sample) studies

Population: at least some children aged < 5 years with suspected UTI

Index tests: microscopy or dipstick tests used to diagnose UTI or an evaluation of urine sampling methods.

Reference standard: culture or culture combined with other tests

Outcome measures: sufficient information to construct a 2 × 2 table

Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts for relevance, we resolved disagreements by consensus. One reviewer performed inclusion assessment; data extraction and quality assessment and a second reviewer checked this. We extracted 2 × 2 data and used this to calculate measures of diagnostic performance. We used QUADAS to assess study quality. Individual QUADAS items were used to investigate heterogeneity and to present a detailed assessment of quality to the reader.

For each test, or test combination, we calculated the range in sensitivity, specificity, positive (LR+) and negative (LR-) likelihood ratios, and diagnostic odds ratios (DOR). We selected likelihood ratios as the measure of test performance for further analysis as these measures are easier to interpret than sensitivity and specificity. For tests investigated in more than two studies, we used random effects models to pool positive and negative likelihood ratios. Where studies presented more than one estimate of test performance for the same test, for example at different cut-off points or for different patient subgroups, we only included one estimate in the pooled analysis. We aimed to select the data set most similar to the estimates provided by the other studies in terms of population, test manufacturer or population. Heterogeneity of likelihood ratios was investigated using the Q statistic and through visual examination of forest plots of study results.

THE CLINICAL LANDSCAPE OF URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS

An estimated 400 million urinary tract infections (UTIs) occur each year globally, with over 200,000 associated deaths, making UTIs one of the most common bacterial diseases and drivers of antimicrobial usage. UTIs disproportionately affect women, up to 60% of whom experience at least one UTI in their lifetime. This association is generally attributed to anatomy, although hormonal factors also play an increasingly recognized role, including in relation to the vaginal microbiome. Traditionally, a UTI is defined by clinical signs and symptoms such as urinary frequency, urgency, pelvic or lower abdominal pain, pyuria, or urinary incontinence — often in combination with identification of an offending pathogen via urine culture. This symptom-based approach to UTIs can lack sensitivity or specificity in certain populations, including the very young and elderly, or individuals who are chronically catheterized, with urologic or neurologic abnormalities. For these patients, signs and symptoms can be ambiguous.

### Urinary tract infections in children: an overview of diagnosis and management [^f3ef8554]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2019). High credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common and potentially serious bacterial infection of childhood. History and examination findings can be non-specific, so a urine sample is required to diagnose UTI. Sample collection in young precontinent children can be challenging. Bedside dipstick tests are useful for screening, but urine culture is required for diagnostic confirmation. Antibiotic therapy must be guided by local guidelines due to increasing antibiotic resistance. Duration of therapy and indications for imaging remain controversial topics and guidelines lack consensus. This article presents an overview of paediatric UTI diagnosis and management, with highlights of recent advances and evidence updates.

### Scientific advances in understanding the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and prevention of urinary tract infection in the past 10 Years [^f1ea3e1b]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a very common disease that is accompanied by various complications in the affected person. UTI triggers diverse inflammatory reactions locally in the infected urinary bladder and kidney, causing tissue destruction and organ failure. Moreover, systemic responses in the entire body carry the risk of urosepsis with far-reaching consequences. Understanding the cell-, organ-, and systemic mechanisms in UTI are crucial for prevention, early intervention, and current therapeutic approaches. This review summarizes the scientific advances over the last 10 years concerning pathogenesis, prevention, rapid diagnosis, and new treatment approaches. We also highlight the impact of the immune system and potential new therapies to reduce progressive and recurrent UTI.

POTENTIAL CAVEATS OF NEW DIAGNOSTICS: IN VITRO DIAGNOSTIC (IVD) AND NON-IVD PATHWAYS

As the preceding sections show, diverse new assays stand to expand current diagnostic options for UTIs. A variety of these products may continue toward larger clinical trials and formal regulatory approval, which in the USA entails approval/clearance by the FDA as an in vitro diagnostic. Although the underlying technologies are diverse, several common principles would apply to implementation of these tests in real-world medical practice, including potential challenges. Fundamentally, the goal of any new diagnostic is to improve upon existing standards of care, especially in terms of increased sensitivity, specificity, or speed. Although there is a natural desire to apply emerging technologies to longstanding clinical challenges, molecular diagnostics are not intrinsically superior to other methodologies. The specific context of testing is critical to gauging added value. Ambiguity around detection of particular species at a CFU/mL level in a urine culture equally applies to that organism's molecular detection. More so, the need for cross-calibration between culture and molecular techniques entails a further level of complexity, especially with the ability of NAATs to detect nonviable or quiescent bacteria.

### Proposing the "Continuum of UTI" for a nuanced approach to diagnosis and management of urinary tract infections [^d544825b]. The Journal of Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Patients with suspected UTIs are categorized into 3 clinical phenotypes based on current guidelines: no UTI, asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB), or UTI. However, all patients may not fit neatly into these groups. Our objective was to characterize clinical presentations of patients who receive urine tests using the "continuum of UTI" approach.

Materials and Methods

This was a retrospective cohort study of a random sample of adult noncatheterized inpatient and emergency department encounters with paired urinalysis and urine cultures from 5 hospitals in 3 states between January 01, 2017, and December 31, 2019. Trained abstractors collected clinical (eg, symptom) and demographic data. A focus group discussion with multidisciplinary experts was conducted to define the continuum of UTI, a 5-level classification scheme that includes 2 new categories: lower urinary tract symptoms/other urologic symptoms and bacteriuria of unclear significance. The newly defined continuum of UTI categories were compared to the current UTI classification scheme.

Results

Of 220,531 encounters, 3392 randomly selected encounters were reviewed. Based on the current classification scheme, 32.1% (n = 704) had ASB and 53% (n = 1614) did not have a UTI. When applying the continuum of UTI categories, 68% of patients (n = 478) with ASB were reclassified as bacteriuria of unclear significance and 29% of patients (n = 467) with "no UTI" were reclassified to lower urinary tract symptoms/other urologic symptoms.

Conclusions

Our data suggest the need to reframe our conceptual model of UTI vs ASB to reflect the full spectrum of clinical presentations, acknowledge the diagnostic uncertainty faced by frontline clinicians, and promote a nuanced approach to diagnosis and management of UTIs.

### Laboratory diagnosis of urinary tract infections in adult patients [^c0eb7011]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common bacterial infections and account for a significant part of the workload in clinical microbiology laboratories. Enteric bacteria (in particular, Escherichia coli) remain the most frequent cause of UTIs, although the distribution of pathogens that cause UTIs is changing. More important is the increase in resistance to some antimicrobial agents, particularly the resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole seen in E. coli. Physicians distinguish UTIs from other diseases that have similar clinical presentations with use of a small number of tests, none of which, if used individually, have adequate sensitivity and specificity. Among the diagnostic tests, urinalysis is useful mainly for excluding bacteriuria. Urine culture may not be necessary as part of the evaluation of outpatients with uncomplicated UTIs, but it is necessary for outpatients who have recurrent UTIs, experience treatment failures, or have complicated UTIs, as well as for inpatients who develop UTIs.

### Top ten myths regarding the diagnosis and treatment of urinary Tract infections [^47e4a4df]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections (UTI) are the most common type of infection in the United States. A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report in March 2014 regarding antibiotic use in hospitals reported "UTI" treatment was avoidable at least 39% of the time. The accurate diagnosis and treatment of UTI plays an important role in cost-effective medical care and appropriate antimicrobial utilization.

Objective

We summarize the most common misperceptions of UTI that result in extraneous testing and excessive antimicrobial treatment. We present 10 myths associated with the diagnosis and treatment of UTI and succinctly review the literature pertaining to each myth. We explore the myths associated with pyuria, asymptomatic bacteriuria, candiduria, and the elderly and catheterized patients. We attempt to give guidance for clinicians facing these clinical scenarios.

Discussion

From our ambulatory, emergency department, and hospital experiences, patients often have urine cultures ordered without an appropriate indication, or receive unnecessary antibiotic therapy due to over-interpretation of the urinalysis.

Conclusions

Asymptomatic bacteriuria is common in all age groups and is frequently over-treated. A UTI diagnosis should be based on a combination of clinical symptoms with supportive laboratory information. This review will assist providers in navigating common pitfalls in the diagnosis of UTI.

### Diagnosis and management of urinary tract infection and pyelonephritis [^b58a3adf]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the most common bacterial infections treated in the outpatient setting and range in severity from minimally symptomatic cystitis to severe septic shock in a wide array of patients. Diagnosis of uncomplicated cystitis can be inferred from history and physical, and confirmed by urinalysis. Appropriate antimicrobial therapy should rapidly improve symptoms in all UTIs. Treatment can be further tailored according to severity of illness, analysis of individualized risk factors, and antimicrobial resistance patterns. This article discusses treatment options in light of bacterial resistance in the twenty-first century.

### New and developing diagnostic technologies for urinary tract infections [^6977ed72]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2017). Medium credibility.

Timely and accurate identification and determination of the antimicrobial susceptibility of uropathogens is central to the management of UTIs. Urine dipsticks are fast and amenable to point-of-care testing, but do not have adequate diagnostic accuracy or provide microbiological diagnosis. Urine culture with antimicrobial susceptibility testing takes 2–3 days and requires a clinical laboratory. The common use of empirical antibiotics has contributed to the rise of multidrug-resistant organisms, reducing treatment options and increasing costs. In addition to improved antimicrobial stewardship and the development of new antimicrobials, novel diagnostics are needed for timely microbial identification and determination of antimicrobial susceptibilities. New diagnostic platforms, including nucleic acid tests and mass spectrometry, have been approved for clinical use and have improved the speed and accuracy of pathogen identification from primary cultures. Optimization for direct urine testing would reduce the time to diagnosis, yet these technologies do not provide comprehensive information on antimicrobial susceptibility. Emerging technologies including biosensors, microfluidics, and other integrated platforms could improve UTI diagnosis via direct pathogen detection from urine samples, rapid antimicrobial susceptibility testing, and point-of-care testing. Successful development and implementation of these technologies has the potential to usher in an era of precision medicine to improve patient care and public health.

### Novel technologies for the diagnosis of urinary tract infections [^e04c5ca1]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

From a microbial perspective, each uropathogenic species may carry its own infection dynamics, such that employing universal thresholds across all species to define infection (e.g. ≥ 10 5 CFU/mL) is likely an oversimplification. Some patients may experience symptomatic infections with bacterial counts as low as 10 2 CFU/mL. Not only are these levels below the limit of detection of a standard 1 µL inoculum, but they overlap with potential levels of contamination. Unfortunately, in deciphering low-level pathogens from prominent contaminants, a laboratory cannot directly control for the variable quality of specimen collection, and a traditional culture cannot differentiate the active pathological process of a UTI from colonization/ASB.

### Antibiotic overprescription for "Urinary tract infections" is associated with poor diagnostic stewardship and low adherence to guidelines [^546d4847]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Medium credibility.

5 Conclusions

Our data continue to support evidence that UTIs are often diagnosed and treated in a manner inconsistent with guidelines meant to direct best clinical practices. Laboratory tests are frequently used in the absence of urinary symptoms demonstrating inappropriate testing. Over‐testing is contributing to the overtreatment of patients without UTI symptoms and often without microbiological evidence of infection. Given the potential harms of overtreatment such as antibiotic resistance, recurrent infections, and high healthcare costs, our study demonstrates the need for advances in adherence to and understanding of UTI diagnostic criteria and treatment guidelines as well as improved diagnostic and antimicrobial stewardship.

### Diagnostic value of symptoms and signs for identifying urinary tract infection in older adult outpatients: systematic review and meta-analysis [^5b62bbce]. The Journal of Infection (2018). Low credibility.

Implications for clinical practice

Evidence from included studies suggests that a number of symptoms and signs traditionally thought to be associated with UTI, may be of limited diagnostic value in older adults. This review highlights the complexity of diagnosing UTI in older adults, and the breadth of their clinical presentations. The results of this review are based on evidence from studies of variable quality and therefore should be treated with caution. Further high quality studies, with large numbers of participants, need to be performed to corroborate these findings. This would assist clinicians with prompt and accurate diagnosis of true UTI, encouraging appropriate treatment with antimicrobials. Clarity in this area may also help clinicians to differentiate UTI from asymptomatic bacteriuria, reducing inappropriate antimicrobial prescriptions for the latter condition, thereby improving antimicrobial stewardship. It is unclear how application of information from this review might translate into improved diagnostic rates of UTI in older adults or improve appropriate antimicrobial prescribing.

### American Urogynecologic Society best-practice statement: recurrent urinary tract infection in adult women [^6538b299]. Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infection — urine culture diagnostic thresholds and reporting: A positive urine culture is typically characterized by bacteriuria of at least 10^5 colony-forming units (CFU)/mL, although according to the European Association of Urology guidelines, a count of 10^2 CFU/mL in symptomatic patients is sufficient for diagnosis; Canadian guidelines state that even 10^2 CFU is sufficient in the setting of UTI symptoms, and certain laboratories may report 10^4 or less as "no growth".

### Urinary tract infection: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of the initial UTI in febrile infants and children 2 to 24 months [^3775417f]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) diagnostic policy considerations: Harms/risks/costs state that stringent diagnostic criteria may miss a small number of UTIs, the benefit-harms assessment is a preponderance of benefit over harm, and value judgments note that treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria may be harmful; the role of patient preferences is that parents prefer no action in the absence of a UTI (avoiding false-positive results) over a very small chance of missing a UTI, with exclusions noted as none, intentional vagueness as none, and policy level as recommendation.

### The emergency department diagnosis and management of urinary tract infection [^8a238770]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common infection seen in the emergency department. The spectrum of UTI includes simple versus complicated infection and lower versus upper UTI. No one history or examination finding is definitive for diagnosis. Testing often includes urinalysis and/or urine dipstick, and several pitfalls may occur in interpretation. Urine cultures should be obtained in complicated or upper UTIs but not simple and lower tract UTIs, unless a patient is pregnant. Imaging often is not required. Most patients with simple cystitis and pyelonephritis are treated as outpatients. A variety of potentially dangerous conditions may mimic UTI and pyelonephritis.

### Urinary tract infections in children [^4f15c1f3]. Pediatrics in Review (2024). Medium credibility.

Despite the American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines for the evaluation, treatment, and management of urinary tract infections (UTIs), UTI diagnosis and management remains challenging for clinicians. Challenges with acute UTI management stem from vague presenting signs and symptoms, diagnostic uncertainty, limitations in laboratory testing, and selecting appropriate antibiotic therapy in an era with increasing rates of antibiotic-resistant uropathogens. Recurrent UTI management remains difficult due to an incomplete understanding of the factors contributing to UTI, when to assess a child with repeated infections for kidney and urinary tract anomalies, and limited prevention strategies. To help reduce these uncertainties, this review provides a comprehensive overview of UTI epidemiology, risk factors, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention strategies that may help pediatricians overcome the challenges associated with acute and recurrent UTI management.

### The diagnosis and treatment of adult urinary tract infections in the emergency department [^b4c73bf9]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Emergency medicine has been called the art of "making complicated clinical decisions with limited information". This description is particularly relevant in the case of diagnosis and treatment of urinary tract infections (UTIs). Although common, UTIs are often challenging to diagnose given the presence of non-specific signs and symptoms and over-reliance on laboratory findings. This review provides an interdisciplinary interpretation of the primary literature and practice guidelines, with a focus on diagnostic and antimicrobial stewardship in the emergency department.

### Evaluation and management of urinary tract infection in the emergency department [^9e60afc6]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) affects patients of all ages and is a diagnosis that emergency physicians might make multiple times per shift. This article reviews the evaluation and management of patients with infections of the urinary tract. Definitions of asymptomatic bacteriuria, uncomplicated UTI, and complicated UTI are presented, as well as techniques for distinguishing them. The pathophysiology and clinical and laboratory diagnoses of UTI are described. Treatment of UTI is reviewed, with attention to bacteriuria and special populations, including pregnant, elderly/geriatric, and spinal cord injury patients.

### Diagnostic stewardship for urine cultures [^579168d4]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections are among the most common infectious diagnoses in health care, but most urinary tract infections are diagnosed inappropriately in patients without signs or symptoms of infection. Asymptomatic bacteriuria leads to inappropriate antibiotic prescribing and negative downstream effects, including antimicrobial resistance, health care-associated infections, and adverse drug events. Diagnostic stewardship is the process of modifying the ordering, performing, or reporting of test results to improve clinical care. Diagnostic stewardship impacts the diagnostic pathway to decrease inappropriate detection and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria. This article reviews diagnostic stewardship methods and closes with a case study illustrating these principles in practice.

### Further investigation of confirmed urinary tract infection (UTI) in children under five years: a systematic review [^1bfe20d0]. BMC Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Methods

We assembled a database of published and unpublished literature from systematic searches of 16 electronic databases (inception to between October 2002 and February 2003), hand searching of 12 journals, consultation with experts in the field, and screening bibliographies of included studies. Update searches were conducted in May 2004. There were no language restrictions. Full details of the search strategy will be reported elsewhere.

We included controlled trials that compared different imaging strategies and reported patient based outcomes. We also included diagnostic cohort studies that included at least 20 children, some of whom were aged five years or under, and that reported sufficient information to construct 2 × 2 tables. Table 1 presents a summary of the tests evaluated in this review and details the potential advantages that these tests have over the current reference standards. Although other tests have been evaluated, this article will focus on those offering potential advantages over the current reference standard. Studies had to compare one of the index tests listed in this table to the listed reference standard, for each of the different aims.

### Diagnostic value of symptoms and signs for identifying urinary tract infection in older adult outpatients: systematic review and meta-analysis [^6bb43665]. The Journal of Infection (2018). Low credibility.

Implications for future research

In order to make robust conclusions about the diagnostic value of symptoms and signs in diagnosing UTI in older adults, additional high quality studies are required. More studies assessing the utility of combinations of different symptoms in diagnosing UTI would also be beneficial. It would be helpful if definitions of symptoms and signs were consistent across studies, or at least reported in full and transparently, to allow meaningful comparisons between studies and pooling of results. Building up the evidence base for the clinical predictors that predict UTI in older adult outpatients could facilitate robust guidance, generation of clinical prediction rules, and improve the accuracy of the diagnosis. Further studies in this area are needed in order to make confident assertions of the utility of different symptoms and signs in diagnosing these infections in older adults.

Diagnostic stewardship — pretest probability and UTI ordering context — Pretest estimates of disease are based on the incidence of disease in specific populations and how risk factors or symptoms modify probability, and this estimation is challenging in patients with nonspecific symptoms. In elderly patients, urine cultures are often ordered for nonspecific symptoms such as failure to thrive or fatigue, and the incidence of urinary tract infections in elderly women is higher than the general population as is the prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common occurrence in children. The management and laboratory diagnosis of these infections pose unique challenges that are not encountered in adults. Important factors, such as specimen collection, urinalysis interpretation, culture thresholds, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing, require special consideration in children and will be discussed in detail in the following review.

### Novel technologies for the diagnosis of urinary tract infections [^88a3bce3]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

UTIs are characterized according to several schema and terminologies, which are relevant to their diagnostic work-up. Anatomically, lower UTIs are confined to the bladder (cystitis) and/or urethra, while upper UTIs involve ascension to the kidneys (pyelonephritis). The latter are more commonly associated with both bacteremia (a condition defined microbiologically) and urosepsis (defined clinicopathologically), although they may occur with cystitis alone. UTIs may be further defined according to patient risk factors. Uncomplicated UTI (uUTI) affects non-pregnant, immunocompetent females without structural/functional urinary tract abnormalities or other predisposing conditions. Notably, an explicit microbiologic diagnosis (i.e. urine culture) is not necessarily indicated for routine cases of uncomplicated cystitis, as empiric antimicrobial therapy is often appropriate. Complicated UTI (cUTI) is an umbrella term for infections arising in the context of risk factor(s) listed above for uUTI. Traditionally, a UTI in a male is inherently considered complicated (although this is controversial). Complicated infections secondary to catheterization are termed catheter associated UTIs. In terms of temporal dynamics, multiple episodes of symptomatic infection (two within 6 months or three within 1 year) with intervening periods of clinical resolution are recurrent UTIs. These may represent persistent infections by the same offending organism or reinfection by a different species/strain. Likewise, the term chronic UTI is applied loosely to either recurrent or unresolving infections. Finally, the concept of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) refers to recovery of a potential uropathogen at high burden (typically > 10 5 CFU/mL) in the absence of symptomatology. Antimicrobial therapy is typically not indicated for ASB, except in certain populations at high risk for adverse outcomes (e.g. renal transplant recipients and pregnant women, especially those undergoing invasive urologic procedures).

Table 1
Summary of tests used for different clinical applications

Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts for relevance, any disagreements were resolved by consensus. One reviewer performed inclusion assessment, data extraction and quality assessment; a second reviewer checked this. We extracted 2 × 2 data from each of the studies and used this to calculate estimates of test performance. Where insufficient details were reported, we contacted authors to request further information. We assessed the methodological quality of diagnostic accuracy studies using QUADAS. Individual QUADAS items were used to investigate heterogeneity and to present a detailed assessment of quality to the reader.

We analysed results grouped by clinical aim. Where studies presented more than one estimate of test performance for the same test, we only included one estimate in the pooled analysis. We aimed to select the most appropriate data set or the one most similar to that used by other studies in terms of population, technique or unit of analysis. For example, data for tests used to localise infection were analysed by patient in preference to kidney or renal unit (kidney and ureter), whereas data for tests used to detect VUR were analysed by renal unit. For each test, or test combination, we calculated the range in sensitivity, specificity, positive (LR+) and negative (LR-) likelihood ratios, and diagnostic odds ratios (DOR). Where sufficient studies were available, pooled likelihood ratios were calculated for each test. Heterogeneity of likelihood ratios was investigated using the Q statistic and through visual examination of forest plots of study results. We presented individual studies results graphically by plotting estimates of sensitivity and specificity in receiver operating characteristic (ROC) space. Where sufficient data were available, we used regression analysis to investigate heterogeneity. We extended the summary ROC (sROC) model, estimated by regressing D (log DOR) against S (logit true positive rate – logit false positive rate), weighted according to sample size, to include the variables for patient age (< 2 years, < 5 years, < 12 years and < 18 years), geographic region, and QUADAS items. For ultrasound for the detection of VUR a variable for ultrasound technique (contrast-enhanced or standard) was also included.

### Recalcitrant chronic bladder pain and recurrent cystitis but negative urinalysis: what should we do? [^233df5bf]. International Urogynecology Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

There is growing awareness that urinary tract infection (UTI), undetected by routine diagnostics, might play a causal role in the generation of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). This proposal is controversial because the exclusion of UTI is a key step in every guideline concerned with the management of LUTS. As a result, LUTS have become synonymous with noninfective disease. However, there is increasing evidence that patients presenting with LUTS may harbour a UTI despite negative tests. The problem lies with the diagnostic criteria used in culture-based diagnosis. A significant body of published literature points to the inherent flaws of quantitative urinary microbiological analysis, in which thresholds between 10 3 cfu mL −1 and 10 6 cfu mL −1 of a pure growth of a single urinary pathogen are employed to diagnose UTI. Dipstick urinalysis performs equally poorly, hampered by insensitivity and spectrum bias. These tests cannot reliably exclude UTI and do not take into account differences in bacterial strain virulence, host genetic variability, intracellular bacterial reservoirs, or even urine dilution due to high fluid intake before the test.

### Urinary tract infections in children: an overview of diagnosis and management [^51acec5c]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2019). High credibility.

Diagnosis: culture

Laboratory culture is the gold standard for UTI diagnosis. Urine is sterile; therefore, the presence of bacteria in sufficient quantity, with concurrent evidence of active infection, suggests UTI. Urine is added to a growth medium, from which bacteria and antibiotic sensitivities are identified. Culture takes around 24 hours, then the presumptive diagnosis can be reviewed. All major UTI guidelines recommend culture is required for UTI diagnosis.

How many bacteria are needed to diagnose UTI in children? Thresholds vary between guidelines and collection methods. The commonly quoted threshold of 100 000 CFU/mL of a single organism is based on a seminal study in adult women by Kassfrom 1956. Does this threshold apply in children? American guidelines suggest a 50 000 CFU/mL threshold with concurrent pyuria for SPA and catheter specimens. More recent evidence suggests an even lower 10 000 CFU/mL threshold would slightly increase sensitivity without reducing diagnostic specificity. Many guidelines suggest that any growth on SPA is abnormal, as SPA has negligible contamination.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) is the presence of bacteria in the urine without active infection. ASB prevalence is estimated at 1.4%–1.9% in childhood. Bacterial growth without evidence of active infection (eg, pyuria) does not suggest UTI.

In reality, these diagnostic thresholds are not binary. Low colony counts on culture may represent early infection, contamination or ASB. Pyuria may occasionally be absent in early infection or immunocompromise. Screening and culture results must always be considered in the clinical context.

Contamination

Contamination muddies the waters when evaluating UTI. Assuming a single uropathogen causes UTI, multiple organisms suggests sample contamination. Incidental flora colonise the perigenital skin and can get flushed into the urine sample on voiding. Missed diagnosis can occur if a true uropathogen is concealed in the mix or misdiagnosis if a single contaminant dominates the culture. Contamination can be minimised by cleaning the perigenital skin before sample collectionand avoiding touching inside the specimen jar or holding the jar against the child's skin.

What is on the horizon?

Current tests for UTI lack absolute sensitivity or specificity. Urinary biomarkers such as interleukin 6 and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin have been proposed to differentiate between active infection and ASB. Real-time PCR has been proposed to identify common uropathogens such as E. coli. Further research is required to understand the clinical utility of these emerging tests.

### ACP best practice No 167: the laboratory diagnosis of urinary tract infection [^a24bbfbe]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2001). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infection is common, and it is not surprising that urine specimens make up a large proportion of those samples submitted to the routine diagnostic laboratory. Many of these specimens will show no evidence of infection and several methods can be used to screen out negative samples. Those that grow bacteria need to be carefully assessed to quantify the degree of bacteriuria and hence clinical relevance. To influence treatment, a final report should be produced within 24 hours of specimen receipt, with turnaround times continuously monitored. Much work needs to be done to determine the cost effectiveness involved in processing urine specimens and the evidence base for the final report provided.

Guidelines for the diagnosis, prevention, and management of persons with catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CA-UTI), both symptomatic and asymptomatic, were prepared by an Expert Panel of the Infectious Diseases Society of America. The evidence-based guidelines encompass diagnostic criteria, strategies to reduce the risk of CA-UTIs, strategies that have not been found to reduce the incidence of urinary infections, and management strategies for patients with catheter-associated asymptomatic bacteriuria or symptomatic urinary tract infection. These guidelines are intended for use by physicians in all medical specialties who perform direct patient care, with an emphasis on the care of patients in hospitals and long-term care facilities.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® recurrent lower urinary tract infections in females [^0ac1d230]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) in women are common, with an overall lifetime risk over > 50%. UTIs are considered recurrent when they follow complete clinical resolution of a previous UTI and are usually defined as at least three episodes of infection within the preceding 12 months. An uncomplicated UTI is classified as a UTI without structural or functional abnormalities of the urinary tract and without relevant comorbidities. Complicated UTIs are those occurring in patients with underlying structural or medical problems. In women with recurrent uncomplicated UTIs, cystoscopy and imaging are not routinely used. In women suspected of having a recurrent complicated UTI, cystoscopy and imaging should be considered. CT urography or MR urography are usually appropriate for the evaluation of recurrent complicated lower urinary tract infections or for women who are nonresponders to conventional therapy, develop frequent reinfections or relapses, or have known underlying risk factors. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### A reference standard for urinary tract infection research: a multidisciplinary Delphi consensus study [^5fca69be]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

The absence of a consensus-based reference standard for urinary tract infection (UTI) research adversely affects the internal and external validity of diagnostic and therapeutic studies. This omission hinders the accumulation of evidence for a disease that imposes a substantial burden on patients and society, particularly in an era of increasing antimicrobial resistance. We did a three-round Delphi study involving an international, multidisciplinary panel of UTI experts (n = 46) and achieved a high degree of consensus (94%) on the final reference standard. New-onset dysuria, urinary frequency, and urinary urgency were considered major symptoms, and non-specific symptoms in older patients were not deemed indicative of UTI. The reference standard distinguishes between UTI with and without systemic involvement, abandoning the term complicated UTI. Moreover, different levels of pyuria were incorporated in the reference standard, encouraging quantification of pyuria in studies done in all health-care settings. The traditional bacteriuria threshold (10 5 colony-forming units per mL) was lowered to 10 4 colony-forming units per mL. This new reference standard can be used for UTI research across many patient populations and has the potential to increase homogeneity between studies.

### Urinary tract infection: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of the initial UTI in febrile infants and children 2 to 24 months [^27a3e613]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Pediatrics pediatric UTI diagnosis — Action Statement 1 states that "the clinician should ensure that a urine specimen is obtained for both culture and urinalysis before an antimicrobial agent is administered; the specimen needs to be obtained through catheterization or SPA, because the diagnosis of UTI cannot be established reliably through culture of urine collected in a bag" (evidence quality: A; strong recommendation). Urine obtained through catheterization for culture has "a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 99%", and SPA success rates have been "reported (23%–90%)" with improvement "when ultrasonographic guidance is used". For bag-collected urine, cultures "have an unacceptably high false-positive rate and are valid only when they yield negative results"; at a "prevalence of UTI of 5%" and "specificity: ~63%", a positive bag culture "would be a false-positive result 88% of the time", and in febrile boys at "2%" prevalence the false-positive rate "is 95%"; for circumcised boys at "0.2%", it "is 99%". Therefore, "in cases in which antimicrobial therapy will be initiated, catheterization or SPA is required to establish the diagnosis of UTI". Supporting judgments include "Aggregate quality of evidence: A (diagnostic studies on relevant populations)", "Harms/risks/costs: Catheterization is invasive", "Benefit-harms assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm", and the value judgment that "it is important to have the most-accurate test for UTI performed initially".

Uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) present a significant problem for women and a challenge for the doctors who care for them. The diagnosis of uncomplicated UTI, which usually is not challenging, can be achieved best by a thorough assessment of patient symptoms with or without the addition of a urine dipstick test. Treatment should be based on the most recent Infectious Disease Society of America guidelines, taking into account resistance patterns in the local community. The patient who suffers from recurrent UTIs can be treated safely and effectively with continuous antibiotic prophylaxis, postcoital therapy, or self-initiated treatment.

### The optimal use of diagnostic testing in women with acute uncomplicated cystitis [^69f26821]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Acute uncomplicated cystitis is a common and costly disorder in women, and there is considerable variation in the diagnostic strategies currently used in clinical practice. Because the diagnosis of cystitis can be established in most patients using the history alone, the clinician's responsibility is to determine which patients require additional diagnostic testing. Patients with typical symptoms (i.e., dysuria, frequency, urgency, hematuria), without risk factors for complicated infection or pyelonephritis, and without a history of vaginal discharge, have a very high probability of cystitis and are appropriate candidates for empiric treatment. It is more difficult, however, to rule out infection in patients with suspected cystitis. Because the prevalence of culture-proven infection is very high in women who present with ≥ 1 symptom, and because the treatment threshold for this condition is low, a urine culture is generally required to rule out infection in patients with atypical symptoms, even in the presence of a negative dipstick test. In population-based, before-and-after studies, use of diagnostic algorithms has been shown to significantly decrease the use of urinalysis, urine culture, and office visits while increasing the percentage of patients who receive recommended antibiotics. These strategies have substantially reduced the cost of managing cystitis without an increase in adverse events or a decrease in patient satisfaction. Randomized controlled trials are needed to more closely examine the outcomes, costs of care, and patient satisfaction from different diagnostic and management strategies.

### Recommendations from others… [^dda1fedf]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

Clinical Question How accurate is the urine dipstick for diagnosing urinary tract infection. Evidence-Based Answer. The sensitivity and specificity of the urine dipstick varies somewhat with the setting and population, as does its recommended interpretation. Women with classic urinary tract infection symptoms have a high pretest probability of infection, and use of the dipstick adds little to the diagnosis. In women with nonspecific urogenital symptoms, positive or negative dipstick results may require a backup urine culture depending on the clinical situation. 1 Sensitivity using nitrites and/or leukocyte esterase was highest in the outpatient primary care setting and lowest in pregnant women. Specificity was lowest in the outpatient primary care setting. Table 1 1, 2 discusses the performance of the urine dipstick test for diagnosing UTI in selected populations.

The clinical utility of the dipstick depends on the pretest probability of a UTI. In general, a negative test in a patient with a low pretest probability based on clinical presentation rules out disease, whereas it may not for a patient with a higher pretest probability. Conversely, a positive test may adequately confirm disease for a patient with classic symptoms of UTI and a high pretest probability, but not for a patient with a more confusing clinical picture and a lower pretest probability. One systematic review 2 reported that the pretest probability of UTI in otherwise healthy women with classic UTI symptoms is 60 percent. In women with classic symptoms who do not have any vaginal discharge or irritation, the pretest probability of UTI increases to 90 percent. 2 Patients presenting with at least one poorly defined symptom had a pretest probability of UTI of 50 percent.

In this setting, a positive dipstick increased the probability of a UTI to 81 percent whereas a negative dipstick reduced the probability to 23 percent.
2. A second meta-analysis 4 of diagnosis in children suggests that a dipstick testing positive for both nitrite and leukocyte esterase provides strong evidence in favor of UTI. This study also confirms the usefulness in ruling out disease with a dipstick negative for both nitrites and leukocyte esterase. 4.

### Guide to utilization of the microbiology laboratory for diagnosis of infectious diseases: 2024 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) [^7477bf48]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) — pediatric colony count thresholds, special pathogen testing, and molecular methods are described as follows: In febrile infants and young children (2–24 months), an abnormal urinalysis and a catheterized urine colony count of > 50 000 CFU/mL of a single organism is considered diagnostic, and ≥ 10^4 CFU/mL with reliable detection of pyuria would pick up an additional significant proportion of children with true UTI; identification of a single potential pathogen in numbers as low as 200 CFU/mL may be significant, but if recovery at < 1000 CFU/mL is desired, the workup must be discussed in advance with the laboratory to achieve this lower level of detection. Yeast in urine may rarely indicate systemic infection and clinical correlation with additional diagnostic testing is recommended, recovery of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is best with first morning void urine samples of > 20 mL, adenovirus cystitis testing is typically performed using nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) primarily available at reference laboratories, and polyoma BK virus viremopathy is best diagnosed by quantitative molecular determination of circulating virus in blood rather than urine. Although there are no current rapid molecular-based FDA approved technologies available for diagnosis of urinary tract infection, several applications of next generation sequencing direct on urine are in development or are commercially available; this strategy is not appropriate for all patient populations and clinical presentations and may lead to overtreatment with antibiotics, and studies evaluating utilization are scant and more evidence is needed before these technologies become widely adopted.

### Rapid tests and urine sampling techniques for the diagnosis of urinary tract infection (UTI) in children under five years: a systematic review [^b7c569e0]. BMC Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Although, in practice, microscopy and culture are generally requested in combination, microscopy has the advantage of being quicker to provide a result. It may be that microscopy has some potential as a test that could be performed in the GP surgery. However, it remains more expensive than a dipstick test and requires some degree of expertise to perform. The studies of microscopy showed considerable heterogeneity, in terms of results, cut-off points, types of urine samples and population. A urine sample that was positive for both pyuria and bacteriuria on microscopy was found to be very good for ruling in disease. Similarly, a urine sample that was negative for both pyuria and bacteriuria on microscopy was found to be very good for ruling out disease.

The possibility of publication bias remains a potential problem in this review. It is possible, and indeed likely, that studies reporting higher estimates of test performance are more often published, but the extent to which this occurs is unclear. There is evidence that publication bias is a particular problem for studies of small sample size, although these data are general and does not come from the diagnostic literature. We restricted this review to studies that included at least 20 children, meaning that this type of publication bias is less likely to be a problem. We are unaware of any articles on publication bias in diagnostic tests or on methods to formally assess publication bias in a diagnostic systematic review.

We chose likelihood ratios as the primary effect measure as these are the measure that physicians find easiest to interpret. We used pooled likelihood ratios and estimates of the pre-test probability of disease to calculate estimates of the post-test probability of disease. These measures provide a simple illustration of how the results of a test change the probability of disease and help the reader to determine how useful a test is likely to be in practice. The main limitation of this approach was the considerable heterogeneity in pooled likelihood ratios; it is debatable whether it is appropriate to pool these estimates. It is important that pooled estimates are interpreted with caution and that the heterogeneity between studies is considered when interpreting these results. A further problem with this analysis is that positive and negative likelihood ratios were pooled individually. These measures are likely to be correlated within an individual study and ignoring this correlation may be problematic.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^ebb22780]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) diagnostic definitions and specimen requirements — In patients without indwelling catheters, ASB is defined as ≥ 10^5 colony-forming units (CFU)/mL in a voided urine specimen without signs or symptoms attributable to urinary tract infection (UTI). For women, 2 consecutive specimens obtained preferably within 2 weeks are used to confirm persistence, and between 10% and 60% of women do not have persistent bacteriuria on repeat screening after an initial positive specimen. For men, a single urine specimen meeting these quantitative criteria is sufficient for diagnosis. In patients with indwelling devices, ≥ 10^3 CFU/mL remains the most appropriate diagnostic criteria for bladder bacteriuria, while lower quantitative counts (≥ 10^2 to < 10^5 CFU/mL) from "in and out" catheterization or after insertion of a new indwelling catheter suggest true bacteriuria, although the clinical significance of these lower counts in asymptomatic people has not been evaluated.

Recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) — diagnostic approach emphasizes clinical judgement over test-centric diagnosis, stating that "the answer to improved antimicrobial stewardship lies not in better testing, but in better clinical judgement". It adds that "clinicians should no longer rely on the findings of standard urine culture or any other ancillary detection method as a substitute for clinical judgement", that "Whenever possible, patients should be evaluated at each symptomatic presentation, at least with documentation of specific signs and symptoms and laboratory assessment", and that decisions should synthesize presentation and tests when "antibiotic treatment is likely to be of benefit".

Diagnosis — women with frequent UTI may experience diagnostic delay if clinicians do not review the UTI history; clinicians should order pretreatment urine cultures to document rUTI (culture-proven UTI ≥ 2 in 6 months or ≥ 3 in 12 months), and although infrequent UTI can be assessed with less rigor and treated empirically, women with frequent UTI who are being formally assessed for rUTI should have detailed symptom assessment and pretreatment urine culture and sensitivity.

We presented individual studies results graphically by plotting estimates of sensitivity and specificity in receiver operating characteristic (ROC) space. Where sufficient data were available, we used regression analysis to investigate heterogeneity. We extended the summary ROC (sROC) model, estimated by regressing D (log DOR) against S (logit true positive rate – logit false positive rate), weighted according to sample size, to include covariates relating to patient age (< 2 years, < 5 years, < 12 years and < 18 years), geographic region and each of the 14 QUADAS items. In addition, for microscopy for pyuria and bacteriuria a variable on whether the sample was centrifuged was included, and for microscopy for bacteriuria a variable for Gram stain was included.

### Diagnostic value of symptoms and signs for identifying urinary tract infection in older adult outpatients: systematic review and meta-analysis [^f1bce9c7]. The Journal of Infection (2018). Low credibility.

Strengths and limitations

To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review and meta-analysis assessing the utility of symptoms and signs in diagnosing UTI in older adult outpatients. Our search strategy was broad, in order to maximise chances of capture of relevant studies. We contacted several authors of studies to clarify details in the papers being screened for inclusion. Dual extraction of all data was performed. Data was extracted as fully as possible, providing gender specific data when possible. However, due to the breadth of the review, and given the difficulty of search terms in this area it is highly likely we have missed studies, especially unpublished studies. Whilst we were able to extract data for a wide range of symptoms and signs, due to variations in the way they were reported, meta-analysis was only possible for two symptoms.

Our results should be interpreted with caution as a number of the included studies were of poor quality, there was high heterogeneity between the included studies, and few symptoms and signs were assessed across more than one study. We postulate that differences in study design, the low quality of a number of the included studies and differences in definition of symptoms and signs may explain the observed heterogeneity. Furthermore, we assessed multiple independent symptoms and signs; having applied 95% confidence intervals, we might expect that 1 in 20 of our estimates might produce significant results as a result of chance.

A number of the studies were rated as 'high risk' across a number of the QUADAS-2 domains. However, we also recognise that in studies assessing the diagnostic accuracy of symptoms and signs, by their very nature, it is difficult to entirely eliminate subjectivity and a degree of bias. For example, incorporation bias is largely unavoidable because diagnoses of infections are often made taking into account symptoms and signs, as well as test results. Partly as a result of this as well as lack of standardisation of methodology, the feasibility of pooling results from such studies is restricted by significant heterogeneity. Insufficient studies were included within the meta-analysis to allow for meaningful subgroup analysis to be performed to explore the high heterogeneity.

### Diagnostic stewardship cutoffs for urinalysis results prior to performing a urine culture: analysis of data from a healthcare system [^25566c6b]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

By 2050, an estimated 8.2 million deaths globally associated with antimicrobial-resistant infections will occur, an increase from 1.27 million deaths in 2019. By 2050, the added healthcare costs attributed to antimicrobial-resistant infections could reach an estimated 1 trillion US dollars. The emergence of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens is fueled by antibiotic use and misuse. Misdiagnosis and overdiagnosis of urinary tract infections (UTIs) is recognized as an important contributor to inappropriate antibiotic use.

Misinterpretation of urine tests is a major driver of inappropriate UTI diagnosis. A positive urine culture without UTI-specific symptoms indicates asymptomatic bacteriuria, not a UTI, yet asymptomatic bacteriuria often leads to unnecessary antibiotic treatment. Among patients with asymptomatic bacteriuria, 32%–60% are inappropriately treated with antibiotics.

Antibiotic stewardship programs are an essential part of hospital practice, aimed at optimizing antibiotic use. Diagnostic stewardship harnesses aspects of diagnostic testing to achieve stewardship goals, such as improving diagnostic accuracy and optimizing lab result output to minimize provider misinterpretation.

A diagnostic stewardship approach to decrease inappropriate antibiotic prescribing for asymptomatic bacteriuria is the reflex urine culture. This algorithmic approach triggers a urine culture only if predefined urinalysis criteria are met, such as significant pyuria. Reflex urine cultures have been shown to reduce urine culture rates, subsequently reducing unnecessary antibiotic use. – However, considerable variability exists in the urinalysis parameters and the thresholds used in reflex algorithms. A survey of 28 healthcare facilities that implemented a reflex urine culture program revealed 26 different reflex algorithms, highlighting the heterogeneity in approach.

To address this heterogeneity, we aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of urinalysis parameters in predicting uropathogens from urine cultures across different patient care settings. We sought to identify the parameter(s) with the highest performance for detecting uropathogens, considering a wide range of urinalysis parameters and their combinations.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^49cf53f8]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infection — diagnostic criteria and documentation (Clinical Principle) states that clinicians should document evidence of inflammation (pyuria) and uropathogenic bacteria during symptomatic episodes, defining recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) as at least two acute episodes in six months of urinary tract–associated symptoms and signs. Evidence of infection should include significant bacteriuria and urinary inflammation (pyuria with ≥ 5 WBC/hpf on microscopic urinalysis), and the absence of pyuria rules out UTI in symptomatic women with confirmed bacteriuria. Documentation of bacterial uropathogens during each symptomatic period is critical, and inconsistent bacteriuria or organisms should prompt consideration of alternative diagnoses; given limitations of standard urine culture, clinicians should consider additional available information, including alternative tests, with critical deliberation, and it is important to consider all clinical and laboratory data when deciding whether antibiotic treatment is needed.

Microscopy

A total of 39 studies reporting 101 data sets evaluated microscopy for diagnosing UTI. Microscopy was used to determine the presence of pyuria or bacteriuria, or combinations of the two. Table 3 summarises the results of these studies.

Table 3
Summary of results for studies of microscopy

* There was significant heterogeneity in all pooled estimates therefore these should be interpreted with caution

Figure 4 shows the estimates of sensitivity and 1-specificity plotted in ROC space for all studies. This graph suggests that bacteriuria is considerably better than pyuria both for ruling out and ruling in disease. The diagnostic performance of bacteriuria may be improved when combined with pyuria. The pooled positive likelihood ratios are highest for pyuria and bacteriuria combined (37.0, 95% CI: 11.0, 125.9), where a positive result was defined as both tests positive, supporting the suggestion that the combination of a positive result for both of these tests may be useful for ruling in disease. Conversely, the lowest negative likelihood ratio resulted from the combination of pyuria and bacteriuria (0.11, 95% CI: 0.14, 0.24), where a negative result was defined as both tests negative, and this may be useful for ruling out disease. However, the confidence intervals around the pooled estimates are large, and in combination with the observed heterogeneity suggest considerable uncertainty in these estimates.

### Urinary tract infection: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of the initial UTI in febrile infants and children 2 to 24 months [^f36c2ed5]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) diagnostic approach in febrile infants — If a clinician assesses a febrile infant with no apparent source for the fever as not being so ill as to require immediate antimicrobial therapy, then the clinician should assess the likelihood of UTI. If the clinician determines the febrile infant to have a low likelihood of UTI, then clinical follow-up monitoring without testing is sufficient (evidence quality: A; strong recommendation). If the infant is not in a low-risk group, there are 2 choices (evidence quality: A; strong recommendation): obtain a urine specimen through catheterization or suprapubic aspiration (SPA) for culture and urinalysis, or obtain a urine specimen through the most convenient means and perform a urinalysis; if the urinalysis suggests a UTI (positive leukocyte esterase test results or nitrite test or microscopic analysis results positive for leukocytes or bacteria), then a urine specimen should be obtained through catheterization or SPA and cultured; if urinalysis of fresh (< 1 hour since void) urine yields negative leukocyte esterase and nitrite test results, then it is reasonable to monitor the clinical course without initiating antimicrobial therapy, recognizing that negative urinalysis results do not rule out a UTI with certainty.

### Novel technologies for the diagnosis of urinary tract infections [^8dd1ee01]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Along with abundance and purity, additional factors also dictate how each colonial morphotype is characterized by the laboratory. These include the method of collection (invasive versus non-invasive), characteristics of the patient (pediatric versus adult, etc.), as well as the identity of the organisms themselves. Species generally considered urogenital flora (e.g. viridans Streptococcus and coagulase-negative staphylococci other than S. saprophyticus) are infrequently pursued. Various guidelines synthesize these parameters as a framework for working up isolates, including whether to perform definitive taxonomic ID and phenotypic AST. Typically, complete ID/AST is performed for each of one or two cultured urinary isolates. For voided urine, isolation of a uropathogen at > 10 5 CFU/mL is interpreted as the highest evidence of clinical significance, a threshold that shifts down by 1 log for invasively collected specimens. With properly collected specimens, diagnostic cultures from healthy individuals typically generate no colonies (cases of ASB notwithstanding), yielding a reference value of No Growth Observed.

Although guidelines help ensure intra-laboratory standardization, traditional culture protocols are beset by key shortcomings. First and foremost, one must recognize the workflow limitations of culture in relation to diagnostic turnaround and clinical impact. Initial culture data are not available the same day as specimen collection, and traditional phenotypic AST adds at least 1 more day to final reporting. By the time definitive laboratory results can guide care, a patient may have already received several days of empiric therapy. Timeframe aside, the practice of inferring clinical significance from cultured bacterial concentrations stems from historical studies with circumscribed scope. A threshold of 10 5 CFU/mL derives from work focusing on the reproducibility of semi-quantitative data in the context of ASB, as well as the progression of patients to pyelonephritis. Nevertheless, this same approach is now applied to virtually every patient population for whom a culture is desired. A urine culture is now even employed for motivations outside the diagnosis of UTI proper, including evaluation of patients for bladder pain syndrome/interstitial cystitis. As many laboratories attest, the broad application of a method that was initially developed around a narrow focus can led to poor sensitivity/specificity in many scenarios.

Diagnostic stewardship — urine cultures — Avoid testing in nonspecific clinical syndromes (eg, leukocytosis, isolated fever, fatigue, and fall), do not order based on odor or smell, and educate on prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria and lack of treatment benefit. For collection, do not collect from catheter bag and only culture urine if pyuria present on urinalysis. For reporting, use selective and cascade reporting to help tailor antibiotic choices and add comments to nudge toward only using antibiotics with true symptoms of UTI.

### Rapid tests and urine sampling techniques for the diagnosis of urinary tract infection (UTI) in children under five years: a systematic review [^4de6bfb2]. BMC Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

We conducted a regression analysis to investigate possible explanations for the observed heterogeneity. This analysis was carried out according to standard methods for pooling studies of diagnostic accuracy using the summary ROC approach. Using the DOR for further investigation of heterogeneity means that we can only assess whether the factors investigated are associated with the DOR and not with sensitivity and specificity, or with positive and negative likelihood ratios. Often factors that lead to an increase in sensitivity will lead to a decrease in specificity and vice versa, possibly with no effect on the DOR. A further limitation of this analysis was that we could only investigate the effect of variables at the study level. One factor that may impact on the accuracy of the diagnostic tests investigated is patient age. However, as the majority of studies investigated included children aged 0–16 or 18 years and did not report results separately for younger age groups it was not possible to carry out appropriate sub-group analyses to investigate the effects of age on estimates of test accuracy. This is an area where further investigation is required.

### Diagnostic value of symptoms and signs for identifying urinary tract infection in older adult outpatients: systematic review and meta-analysis [^18c0cbb3]. The Journal of Infection (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

There is limited evidence of varying quality appraising the utility of a range of symptoms and signs in diagnosing UTI in older adult outpatients. A number of symptoms and signs traditionally associated with UTI such as urgency, nocturia and abnormal vital signs may be of limited diagnostic value in older adult outpatients. Less classical features, such as inability to perform a range of acts of daily living, might be better predictors of UTI. More evidence from high quality studies conducted in this area is needed.

### Quality appraisal of clinical guidelines for recurrent urinary tract infections using AGREE II: a systematic review [^68885b72]. International Urogynecology Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common bacterial infections worldwide, being experienced by one in three women at least once in their lifetime. Recurrent UTI is defined as more than three infections per year or more than two infections per 6 months, and it has a significant impact on quality of life, as highlighted by an international web-based survey of 1941 affected women. There is also a significant economic burden due to the costs of preventive strategies and sick leave. Most recurrent UTIs occur in otherwise healthy women who have no structural genitourinary tract abnormalities.

CPGs are defined as "systematically developed statements to assist practitioner and patient decisions about appropriate healthcare in specific clinical circumstances" and are developed to optimize and standardize care. The successful implementation of a CPG depends on rigorous development, a clear implementation strategy, and adequate dissemination. Multiple studies across different clinical areas have shown that variability exists in the quality of CPGs, indicating that there is considerable room for improvement, especially in rigour of development and applicability. This is important because diagnostic and therapeutic uncertainty can ensue if CPGs differ in core recommendations because of these limitations.

Differences in clinical practice guideline (CPG) recommendations for the preventive treatment of recurrent UTI have been mentioned previously, but the authors of that report did not assess methodological quality. As a result, diagnostic and therapeutic uncertainty might ensue. We could find not a systematic appraisal of the quality of CPGs for the prevention and diagnostics of recurrent UTI in women. The Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II instrument is often used to assess the methodological quality of CPGs in other areas. We therefore aimed to assess the methodological quality of CPGs for recurrent UTI and to summarize recommendations to help clinical decision makers choose the correct CPG for treatment or diagnostics.

### What is the predictive value of urinary symptoms for diagnosing urinary tract infection in women? [^350e39ec]. Family Practice (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

Our aim was to determine the probability of correctly diagnosing urinary tract infections (UTIs) from urinary symptoms and signs, studying their sensitivity, specificity and likelihood ratio (LR) when clinical history, signs and reactive strip test results are taken into account.

Methods

An epidemiological analysis with a diagnostic and clinical orientation was carried out in a primary health care setting. The subjects comprised 343 women ≥ 14 years of age who consulted their family physician for incident urinary tract symptoms. A guided medical examination was carried out using a check-list formulary, reactive strip test, urine culture and the clinical course of all patients.

Results

The pre-test probability of having UTI among patients with incident urinary symptoms is 0.484 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.431–0.536]. Positive LRs for UTI are: painful voiding 1.31 (95% CI 1.12–1.54), urgency 1.29 (95% CI 1.12–1.50), urinary frequency 1.16 (95% CI 1.06–1.28) and tenesmus 1.16 (95% CI 1.02–1.32). The probability of UTI is reduced by the presence of genital discomfort, dyspareunia, vaginal discharge, positive lumbar fist percussion and perineal discomfort. Nitrites on the urine reactive strip test increase the probability of UTI by > 5 times, moderate pyuria increases it by > 1.5 times, and the presence of both findings does so by > 7 times.

Conclusions

In women with urinary symptoms, a thorough clinical examination, together with performance of a reactive strip test during the office visit, improves the chances of detecting UTI.

### Incidence of pediatric urinary tract infections before and during the COVID-19 pandemic [^e2ccd085]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are one of the most common bacterial infections in childrenand the leading cause of bacterial infections in infants, yet the population incidence for all children is still largely unknown. Urinary tract infections are typically treated with antibiotics and may lead to hospitalization, genitourinary imaging, follow-up visits, and surgical intervention. Controversy remains surrounding the optimal UTI diagnostic criteria, the need for prompt diagnosis, and the role of imaging and prophylactic antibiotic therapy.,

The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with substantial decreases in health care use and viral respiratory infection transmission from social distancing measures. These shifts offer a natural experiment to gain insight into testing, treatment, and outcomes for UTI. For a nontransmissible infection such as UTI, decreased diagnosis during the pandemic would likely be primarily associated with decreased pursuit of medical care and/or a reduction in the evaluation of fever as a result of the near disappearance of most circulating viruses. Fewer UTI diagnoses during the pandemic in the face of unchanged severe outcomes may suggest that overdiagnosis and/or overtreatment were previously occurring.

While many investigations have described changes in patterns of medical care use and trends in common childhood diagnoses during the pandemic, studies have not looked specifically at the incidence of UTI diagnoses in both ambulatory and inpatient settings across community and children's hospitals. The aims of this study were to provide estimates of population-level UTI incidence and assess changes in UTI diagnoses and measures of UTI severity, such as hospitalizations and intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, during the COVID-19 pandemic.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® urinary tract infection-child: 2023 update [^fe5223d0]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a frequent infection in childhood. The diagnosis is usually made by history and physical examination and confirmed by urine analysis. Cystitis is infection or inflammation confined to the bladder, whereas pyelonephritis is infection or inflammation of kidneys. Pyelonephritis can cause renal scarring, which is the most severe long-term sequela of UTI and can lead to accelerated nephrosclerosis, leading to hypertension and chronic renal failure. The role of imaging is to guide treatment by identifying patients who are at high risk to develop recurrent UTIs or renal scarring. This document provides initial imaging guidelines for children presenting with first febrile UTI with appropriate response to medical management, atypical or recurrent febrile UTI, and follow-up imaging for children with established vesicoureteral reflux. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

Widely available rapid tests "such as urine dipsticks or urinalysis, can help prioritize which samples would benefit from expensive multiplexed PCR testing", while "PCR agreement with culture has also been significantly hampered in the setting of polymicrobial infections… because the analytical sensitivity of PCR is much higher than that of conventional urinary culture".

### Urinary tract infection in children: diagnosis, treatment, imaging-comparison of current guidelines [^7769d547]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Background and Objective

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a frequent disorder of childhood, yet the proper approach for a child with UTI is still a matter of controversy. The objective of this study was to critically compare current guidelines for the diagnosis and management of UTI in children, in light of new scientific data.

Methods

An analysis was performed of the guidelines from: American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), Italian Society of Pediatric Nephrology, Canadian Paediatric Society (CPS), Polish Society of Pediatric Nephrology, and European Association of Urology (EAU)/European Society for Pediatric Urology (ESPU). Separate aspects of the approach for a child with UTI, including diagnosis, treatment and further imaging studies, were compared, with allowance for recent research in each field.

Conclusions

The analyzed guidelines tried to reconcile recent reports about diagnosis, treatment, and further diagnostics in pediatric UTI with prior practices and opinions, and economic capabilities. There was still a lack of sufficient data to formulate coherent, unequivocal guidelines on UTI management in children, with imaging tests remaining the main area of controversy. As a result, the authors formulated their own proposal for UTI management in children.

Urinalysis with reflex-to-culture algorithms — pyuria thresholds and exceptions indicate there is no single laboratory parameter or combination of parameters that can sufficiently predict whether the patient has a urinary tract infection or if bacteria will be recovered in culture, and that pyuria alone is likely the best marker in terms of negative predictive value, with leukocyte esterase or white blood cells (WBCs) increasing the likelihood of a positive culture, although detection methods have not been standardized. Although > 10 WBCs per low power field is a commonly adopted threshold for a urinalysis with reflex to culture (UARC) algorithm, this threshold cannot be effectively applied to all patient groups, and exceptions are recommended for patients who are pregnant and for patients with urologic abnormalities or undergoing urologic procedures. Laboratory algorithms should take into account local patient populations and should be guided by both clinicians and laboratorians, and in older adults with mental status changes or other signs classically localizing UTI symptoms, bacteriuria may be unrelated and a thoughtful approach should be taken before interpretations are made.

Pediatric urinary tract infection (UTI) culture methods — dipslide performance and use: Alternative culture methods such as dipslides may have a place in the office setting with sensitivity reported in the range of 87% to 100% and specificity 92% to 98%, but dipslides cannot specify the organism or antimicrobial sensitivities; practices that use dipslides should do so in collaboration with a certified laboratory for identification and sensitivity testing or, in the absence of such results, may need to perform "test of cure" cultures after 24 hours of treatment.

### Cost effectiveness of management strategies for urinary tract infections: results from randomised controlled trial [^ee5573d3]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Urinary tract infections are common in female patients in general practice, and urine is the most frequently received specimen in microbiology laboratories. These common bacterial infections affect half of all women at least once in their lives. Clinical management strategies vary, with empirical antibiotics commonly used. Many practitioners, however, also use urinary dipstick results and request analysis of midstream urine samples. In over 62% of women presenting with suspected urinary tract infection, the diagnosis is laboratory confirmed. The use of dipsticks and clinical scoring algorithms can potentially help to improve the precision of diagnosis by improving the positive predictive values. It is unclear what effects different management strategies will have on the costs and cost effectiveness. We carried out an economic evaluation alongside a randomised controlled trial to investigate the costs and cost effectiveness of the different management strategies for urinary tract infection.

Pediatric urinary tract infection (UTI) diagnosis — urine culture thresholds and organism relevance: In infants and children, an appropriate threshold to consider bacteriuria significant is at least 50 000 CFUs per mL of a single urinary pathogen, and reducing the threshold from 100 000 CFUs per mL to 50 000 CFUs per mL may increase sensitivity but decrease specificity; laboratories that report categorical results (0 to 1000, 1000 to 10 000, 10 000 to 100 000, and more than 100 000 CFUs per mL) require contextual interpretation for results in the 10 000 to 100 000 CFUs per mL range, and organisms such as Lactobacillus spp, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and Corynebacterium spp are not considered clinically relevant urine isolates for otherwise healthy, 2- to 24-month-old children; infants with positive culture alone are recognized as having asymptomatic bacteriuria rather than a true UTI when pyuria is absent.

Background

The diagnosis of urinary tract infection (UTI) in the pediatric field remains a topic of debate. In 2011, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) introduced new guidelines for the diagnosis of UTI in patients 2–24 months old. However, concerns were raised regarding these guidelines.

Methods

This is a retrospective data extraction study that included patients 0–6 months of age who were examined in the pediatric emergency department between 2016 and 2021 and had a urine culture. For each patient, we recorded the diagnosis documented in the medical records, the diagnosis based on the AAP and Israeli guidelines, and the diagnosis according to our 2 proposed protocols. We then compared the percentage of UTI diagnoses according to each diagnostic guideline.

Results

A total of 1432 patients under the age of 6 months underwent urine culture testing during the study period. A total of 83 (5.81%) of these patients were diagnosed with UTI according to the AAP guidelines, 184 of the patients (12.8%) were diagnosed with UTI according to the Israeli guidelines, 102 (7.1%) and 109 (7.6%) of the patients were diagnosed with UTI according to our first and second proposed guidelines, respectively.

Conclusions

We propose a new diagnostic method (guidelines II) that is suitable for patients older than 2 months, with obligatory criteria of abnormal urine test and a lower threshold for the colony count required for diagnosis compared to the AAP guidelines. Further research is required to examine the sensitivity and specificity of our proposed guidelines, so it may replace the current diverse guidelines.

Pyuria thresholds and assessment — The absence of pyuria in children with true UTIs is rare; common explanations for bacteriuria without pyuria include contaminated specimens, insensitive pyuria criteria, and asymptomatic bacteriuria. Standard microscopy of centrifuged urine uses a threshold of 5 white blood cells (WBCs) per high-power field (~25 WBCs per μL), whereas in uncentrifuged urine a counting chamber threshold of at least 10 WBCs per μL has been demonstrated to be more sensitive and performs well in very young infants.

1 Introduction

With nearly half of women experiencing a urinary tract infection (UTI) in their lifetime, these infections are one of the leading reasons for antibiotic prescriptions in the United States and worldwide. Despite their clinical ubiquity, physicians exhibit significant variation in their approaches to the workup and treatment of uncomplicated UTIs that may not always follow clinical practice guidelines. Use of unvalidated approaches to the management of UTIs may lead to inaccurate diagnoses and inappropriate antibiotic treatments; prior studies demonstrate that 50%–70% of antibiotic prescriptions for UTI may be inappropriate, which contributes to worsening global rates of antibiotic resistance.

Current treatment guidelines from the American Urological Society (AUA), Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA), and American Geriatrics Society (AGS) agree that UTI diagnosis should be based on clinical symptomology of urinary symptoms (e.g. dysuria, hematuria, urinary frequency, new incontinence in the absence of vaginal symptoms) associated with culture‐proven bacteriuria with a bacterial uropathogen. Rates of asymptomatic bacteriuria range from 1% to 5% in premenopausal women to 16% in older women in the community and as high as 50% for older women in long‐term care facilities, demonstrating why appropriate clinical symptoms are needed to diagnose a UTI.

Prior studies, however, have shown that among patients diagnosed with a UTI in the emergency room (ER), only 32% of adults and 17% of the oldest adults have urinary symptoms, demonstrating poor adherence to current clinical practice guidelines. Patients who have been inappropriately treated with antibiotics for a UTI (e.g. treating those with asymptomatic bacteriuria) have worse outcomes, which may include subsequent infections with multidrug‐resistant organisms or substantial medication side effects. Patients who have an inappropriate initial antibiotic prescription are also subjected to additional drug costs and are at risk of antibiotic switching which can cost up to $2000 more per patient.

Overdiagnosis and overtreatment of UTIs produce worse patient outcomes, increased healthcare costs, and higher societal antibiotic burden. The goals of our study were to evaluate the factors associated with inappropriate diagnosis and treatment of cystitis in the outpatient setting in a set of patients diagnosed with UTI without signs of bacteremia.

### Rapid tests and urine sampling techniques for the diagnosis of urinary tract infection (UTI) in children under five years: a systematic review [^22e6d0db]. BMC Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Results

The literature searches identified over 10 000 references of which 70 studies were included. Figure 1 shows the flow of studies through the review process. A summary of the results of all 70 studies included in the review is provided [see Additional file 1].

Figure 1
Flow chart of studies through review process.

Quality

The median number of the 14 QUADAS items fulfilled was 8 (range 5–13). The main limitation with the studies was the failure to include an appropriate patient spectrum (< 40%) or to report inclusion criteria. Studies also failed to report sufficient details to judge whether clinical review bias (the availability of clinical information to the person interpreting the test results), diagnostic review bias (the availability of the results of the index test to the person interpreting the reference standard) and test review bias (the availability of the results of the reference standard to the person interpreting the index test) were avoided. Withdrawals and handling of uninterpretable results were also poorly reported. Figure 2 illustrates the number of studies that answered "yes", "no" and "not stated" to each of the 14 QUADAS items. A summary of the results of the quality assessment for each study is provided [see Additional file 2].

Results of the quality assessment.

Urine sampling

Thirteen studies, with a total of 17 different test evaluations, compared the diagnostic accuracy of different methods obtaining urine for testing. These studies compared the results of culture from urine obtained by different sampling methods. Five studies reporting seven data sets assessed the diagnostic accuracy of a clean voided urine (CVU) sample, using a supra-pubic aspiration (SPA) urine sample as the reference standard. When both samples were cultured the agreement between the two sampling methods was good. There was considerable heterogeneity in positive likelihood ratios (p < 0.0001). However, the negative likelihood ratios were statistically homogeneous (p = 0.531). The pooled positive likelihood ratio for a CVU sample was 8.8 (95% CI: 2.6, 29.6) and the pooled negative likelihood ratio was 0.23 (95% CI: 0.18, 0.30). Overall, there were insufficient data to draw any conclusions regarding the appropriateness of using urine samples obtained from bags (4 studies) or pads/nappies (4 studies).

### Dipstick urinalysis for the diagnosis of acute UTI… [^997eb67a]. AAFP (2013). Low credibility.

1 Dipstick urinalysis moderately improves the accuracy of clinical symptoms in establishing or excluding acute UTI in women. A positive nitrite test is more useful than a positive leukocyte esterase test, although both increase the odds of a UTI diagnosis. If nitrite and LE tests are negative, the odds of a UTI decrease by 40 to 60 percent. Three symptoms had a positive likelihood ratio significantly greater than 1.
0. Dipstick urinalysis was more accurate than any individual symptom. 1–3.

A Health Technology Assessment investigation prospectively evaluated three components of dipstick urinalysis to determine whether they independently predicted UTI. 1 Investigators studied 408 symptomatic, nonpregnant women 18 to 70 years of age in an outpatient setting, 254 of whom had UTIs. 1 The researchers created the moderately predictive Dipstick Decision Rule based on positive nitrite results or positive LE and blood results. Recommendations from Others An evidence-based guideline from the University of Michigan estimates that dipstick urinalysis for LE is 75 to 96 percent sensitive and 94 to 98 percent specific. 4 Nitrite testing is less useful because it is positive only if bacteria-producing nitrate reductase is present; results can also be confounded by ascorbic acid consumption.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists states that dipstick urinalysis for LE or nitrite is a rapid and inexpensive screening test, with a sensitivity of 75 percent and specificity of 82 percent. 5 In women with symptoms but negative test results, a urine culture and/or urinalysis should be performed because false-negative results are common. The European Association of Urology recommends dipstick urinalysis to detect pyuria, hematuria, and nitrite if UTI is suspected. 6 Pyuria is present in almost all women with an acutely symptomatic UTI; its absence strongly suggests an alternative diagnosis.
