## Question

Angiography in resuscitated out-of-hospital cardiac arrest

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about when to pursue immediate versus delayed coronary angiography after resuscitated out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, integrating trial data, guidelines, and practical decision points. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the high-level clinical scenarios defined by ECG and hemodynamic status. Then, I should verify the randomized trial evidence for immediate versus delayed strategies in non-STEMI patients. Next, I will examine observational data and their limitations, followed by a careful look at guideline recommendations. After that, I should review patient selection and timing nuances, including the ECG acquisition timing and its implications. Finally, I will synthesize a pragmatic, safety-conscious approach and identify key knowledge gaps and future directions, ensuring I continuously self-check each assertion against the best available evidence as I go along.

> Let me first confirm the foundational framework, because if I misclassify the scenario, everything downstream could be off. The pivotal triage questions are whether there is STEMI on the post-resuscitation ECG and whether the patient is hemodynamically or electrically unstable, since both strongly shape timing and urgency of angiography; the highest-yield scenarios are STEMI and/or instability warranting emergent angiography, whereas stable, non-STEMI patients are where the randomized data inform a more selective or delayed approach [^113xt3YM] [^116Rdown].

> Now, for patients with STEMI on post-resuscitation ECG, I should confirm the default recommendation before I proceed. Immediate coronary angiography with PCI as indicated is recommended across major guidelines and contemporary statements, and importantly, this applies even if the patient is comatose, given the very high prevalence of acute coronary occlusion in this phenotype; the AHA and ESC guidance align here, and COACT explicitly excluded STEMI, reinforcing that STEMI remains a distinct high-priority category for emergent reperfusion [^113xt3YM] [^116G6vDa] [^1122YAV8].

> Wait, let me verify the counterfactual in non-STEMI patients who are hemodynamically or electrically unstable, because I do not want to overgeneralize the delayed strategy to all non-STEMI presentations. For patients with shock, ongoing ischemia, malignant arrhythmias, or refractory VF/VT, immediate angiography remains reasonable despite the absence of STEMI, as stabilization and source control of a potential coronary culprit can be lifesaving; the COACT trial excluded shock and ongoing instability, so the neutral RCT results cannot be extrapolated to this subgroup, and expert consensus and systems reviews support early catheterization in unstable non-STEMI post-arrest patients [^116Rdown] [^1122YAV8] [^111eiyhQ].

> Next, I should review the randomized evidence for stable, non-STEMI patients, since that is where practice is most controversial. The COACT randomized trial showed no survival advantage for immediate versus delayed angiography at 90 days, with a signal toward later initiation of targeted temperature management in the immediate group, which could theoretically be detrimental in the context of neuroprotection priorities [^1122YAV8]. The TOMAHAWK trial similarly found no benefit for immediate angiography and even suggested a trend toward worse 30-day mortality and a composite of death or severe neurologic deficit with immediate angiography, again raising concerns about delays to neuroprotective care and unnecessary procedures in a low-yield subset [^111VJB1z] [^116Y8tMa]. A recent individual patient data meta-analysis pooling COACT and TOMAHAWK confirms no 1-year survival benefit for immediate over delayed strategies, and exploratory subgroup analyses did not identify any subgroup with a differential treatment effect, which is important for external validity [^112SnYcR].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions based on trials alone; I need to check the mechanistic plausibility that explains a neutral result despite a substantial prevalence of coronary disease. The proportion of truly acutely occluded culprit lesions in non-STEMI post-arrest cohorts is lower than in STEMI, with COACT showing about 3–8% acute occlusion in the immediate arm and TOMAHAWK showing roughly a 38% culprit lesion rate but unclear acutely occluded proportion, implying that immediate angiography in all-comers will expose many patients to procedural risk without myocardial salvage benefit, while death is often driven by hypoxic brain injury rather than ongoing ischemia in this population [^1119jMwq] [^112jhZBV]. But wait, what if earlier ECG acquisition after ROSC inflates false-positive STEMI calls and biases triage? Multiple cohort analyses suggest that acquiring the ECG within about 7 minutes of ROSC increases false-positive STEMI diagnoses, so I should double-check ECG timing and, if the first ECG is diagnostic of STEMI but obtained very early, consider repeating it after several minutes to avoid unnecessary immediate angiography in false positives [^116Fx6UL] [^1149ny4P] [^1114SHxu].

> I will now examine the observational data, but I need to ensure I interpret them in light of selection and immortal time bias. Meta-analyses and large registries have repeatedly associated early angiography with improved survival and neurologic outcomes, yet these designs cannot adequately adjust for the fact that patients who are hemodynamically stable, neurologically more favorable, or otherwise "better candidates" are channeled to early angiography, inflating apparent benefit; indeed, more rigorous observational studies and those with adjusted estimates show attenuated associations, and expert statements caution against inferring causality from these data [^117NqtNf] [^116Rdown] [^1144QQpT]. Hmm, wait a minute, even a large French propensity-matched analysis showing improved 30-day survival with immediate angiography remains vulnerable to unmeasured confounding and should not overturn randomized neutrality in stable non-STEMI patients [^1168J93f].

> Next, I should review contemporary guideline syntheses to ensure my recommendations are aligned with consensus. The 2025 ACC/AHA/ACEP multisociety guideline advises against immediate angiography in comatose, hemodynamically and electrically stable post-arrest patients without STEMI, recommending instead a delayed or selective approach; the 2025 AHA post-arrest care guideline concurs and also recommends emergent angiography for all with STEMI, while suggesting angiography prior to discharge for survivors with suspected cardiac etiology, especially with shockable rhythms or LV dysfunction, reflecting a selective, risk-stratified stance [^116G6vDa] [^111eiyhQ] [^113xt3YM] [^111ER67E]. I should confirm that ESC guidance similarly allows for delayed angiography in stable non-STEMI post-arrest patients, which it does, reinforcing a cautious, individualized strategy [^1144yvN6].

> Let me think about patient selection and timing details that change pretest probability and procedural yield. Shockable rhythms, shorter no-flow/low-flow times, younger age, and preserved neurological reflexes increase the likelihood of a coronary culprit and may justify earlier angiography in unstable or selected stable patients, whereas nonshockable rhythms, prolonged downtime, severe comorbidity, and early markers of poor neurologic prognosis argue for delayed or even deferred angiography after initial stabilization and neuroprognostication; additionally, to avoid false-positive STEMI calls, I should ensure the post-ROSC ECG is not obtained too early and consider repeating it if obtained within the first few minutes [^116Rdown] [^114dz18H] [^116Fx6UL] [^1149ny4P].

> I should double-check systems-level considerations because timing is not only about physiology but also about logistics. Regionalized care to PCI-capable centers improves access to angiography and mechanical circulatory support and is associated with better outcomes in observational analyses, though randomized delivery to cardiac arrest centers has not consistently shown survival benefit when compared with standard care pathways; nonetheless, ensuring timely transfer for patients who evolve instability or in whom a coronary cause becomes likely remains prudent [^111iNENw] [^112fUbuQ] [^115RLxVN].

> Synthesizing this, I need to ensure the decision pathway is explicit and safety-focused. For STEMI or hemodynamic/electrical instability, proceed to immediate angiography with PCI as indicated, even if comatose; for stable non-STEMI patients, prioritize stabilization, initiate targeted temperature management, complete neuroprognostication when appropriate, and adopt a delayed or selective angiography strategy guided by serial ECGs, biomarkers, echocardiography, and evolving clinical suspicion; in all cases, reassess frequently, as deterioration can convert a delayed plan into an emergent one, and avoid premature withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy during the early phase [^113xt3YM] [^111eiyhQ] [^116p1LYU].

> Finally, I should acknowledge key uncertainties and future directions, and I need to check whether any subgroup signals have emerged. Individual patient data meta-analyses have not identified subgroups benefiting from immediate angiography in non-STEMI, but the field still lacks robust, real-time biomarkers or imaging to detect the subset with true acute coronary occlusion in the absence of STEMI; ongoing work in rapid CCTA, advanced ECG analytics, and integrated neuro-cardiac phenotyping may refine selection, and continued enrollment in trials is warranted to resolve the persistent equipoise without delaying proven neuroprotective and hemodynamic therapies [^112SnYcR] [^114iPRvn].

For resuscitated out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients, **immediate coronary angiography is indicated for STEMI or persistent ischemia** [^113xt3YM] and is reasonable for hemodynamic or electrical instability, as it improves survival and neurological outcomes [^111eiyhQ] [^116Rdown]. For patients without STEMI who are stable, **delayed or selective angiography is preferred** because randomized trials show no survival benefit with immediate angiography [^1122YAV8] and a trend toward harm in some analyses [^117EtYUA] [^112SnYcR]. Early angiography should be individualized based on rhythm, ECG, hemodynamics, and suspected coronary etiology; **routine immediate angiography is not recommended for stable, non-STEMI patients** [^11715fv6].

---

## Indications for coronary angiography in resuscitated OHCA patients

Current guidelines and expert consensus recommend coronary angiography for selected OHCA patients, with indications stratified by clinical presentation and suspected etiology [^113xt3YM] [^111eiyhQ] [^116GVzVY]:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommendation level** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|
| STEMI or persistent ischemia on ECG | Immediate angiography | Class I |
| Hemodynamic instability (cardiogenic shock, recurrent VT/VF) | Immediate angiography | Class I |
| No STEMI, stable hemodynamics | Delayed or selective angiography | Class IIa |
| Non-shockable rhythm, no obvious non-cardiac cause | Consider angiography | Class IIb |

---

## Evidence supporting immediate coronary angiography

Several studies support **immediate angiography** in specific subgroups:

- **STEMI or persistent ischemia**: Immediate angiography is standard due to high likelihood of acute coronary occlusion and clear benefit from reperfusion [^113xt3YM] [^112cLg1R].

- **Hemodynamic instability**: Early angiography is recommended for cardiogenic shock or recurrent VT/VF, as it identifies and treats reversible coronary causes [^114QrSRP].

- **Observational data**: Early angiography is associated with improved survival and neurological outcomes in high-risk patients, though confounded by selection bias [^117NqtNf] [^112msjCm].

---

## Evidence supporting delayed or selective coronary angiography

Recent randomized trials have clarified the role of **delayed angiography** in stable, non-STEMI patients:

- **COACT trial**: No difference in 90-day survival between immediate and delayed angiography in stable, non-STEMI patients [^1122YAV8].

- **TOMAHAWK trial**: No survival benefit with immediate angiography; a trend toward higher mortality and worse neurological outcomes was observed [^117EtYUA] [^116Y8tMa].

- **Meta-analyses**: Multiple analyses show no survival or neurological benefit from routine immediate angiography in non-STEMI patients [^111yzJ8P] [^112fbEWV] [^112SnYcR].

---

## Risks and benefits of immediate coronary angiography

Immediate angiography offers potential benefits — identification and treatment of acute coronary lesions, improved myocardial salvage, and reduced recurrent arrest — but also carries risks: procedural complications, delays in neurological care (e.g. targeted temperature management), and unnecessary interventions in patients without coronary etiology. The balance of risks and benefits **varies by patient presentation**, favoring immediate angiography in STEMI or instability, but not in stable, non-STEMI patients [^116G6vDa].

---

## Current guidelines and expert consensus

Guidelines emphasize **individualized decision-making**:

- **AHA/ACC 2025 guidelines**: Do not perform immediate angiography in comatose, stable patients without STEMI; use a delayed or selective strategy [^11715fv6].

- **ESC 2021 guidelines**: Consider delayed angiography in hemodynamically stable patients without STEMI after OHCA [^1144yvN6].

- **SCAI expert consensus**: Immediate angiography for STEMI or instability; delayed or selective strategy for stable, non-STEMI patients [^116GVzVY].

---

## Factors influencing the decision to perform immediate coronary angiography

Clinical factors guiding the decision include:

- **Initial rhythm**: Shockable rhythms (VF/VT) suggest cardiac etiology and favor early angiography [^112msjCm].

- **ECG findings**: STEMI or persistent ischemia mandate immediate angiography [^113xt3YM] [^112cLg1R].

- **Hemodynamic stability**: Instability supports immediate angiography; stability allows delay [^114QrSRP] [^111eiyhQ].

- **Suspected coronary etiology**: High suspicion favors early angiography; non-cardiac causes may obviate it [^114QrSRP].

---

## Outcomes associated with immediate coronary angiography

Outcomes vary by **patient subgroup**:

- **STEMI or instability**: Improved survival and neurological outcomes with immediate angiography [^1117EQFB].

- **Stable, non-STEMI**: No survival benefit; possible harm in some analyses [^1122YAV8] [^117EtYUA].

- **Overall**: Outcomes depend on patient selection, timing, and underlying etiology [^116iPteB].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Immediate coronary angiography is indicated for OHCA patients with STEMI, persistent ischemia, or hemodynamic/electrical instability, as it improves outcomes. For stable patients without STEMI, **delayed or selective angiography is preferred**, given the lack of benefit and potential harm with immediate angiography. Decisions should be individualized based on rhythm, ECG, hemodynamics, and suspected etiology, aligning with current guidelines and evidence [^111eiyhQ].

### Early coronary angiography and survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117NqtNf]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Although acute myocardial infarction is a common cause of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), the role of early coronary angiography in OHCA remains uncertain. We conducted a meta-analysis of observational studies to determine the association of early coronary angiography with survival in OHCA.

Methods

We searched multiple electronic databases for published studies on early coronary angiography in OHCA between 1 January 1990 and 18 January 2017. Studies were included if (1) restricted to only OHCA, (2) included an exposure group that underwent early coronary angiography within 1 day of arrest onset and a concurrent control group that did not undergo early coronary angiography, and (3) reported survival outcomes. We used a random-effects model to obtain pooled OR. I 2 ﻿ statistics and Cochran's Q test were used to determine between-study heterogeneity.

Results

A total of 17 studies with 14 972 patients were included, of whom 6424 (44%) received early coronary angiography. Early coronary angiography was associated with higher odds of survival (pooled OR 2.54 (95% CI 1.94 to 3.33)) and survival with favourable neurological outcome (pooled OR 2.37 (95% CI 1.71 to 3.28)). However, there was substantial heterogeneity in our pooled estimate (I 2 = 88% and p value for Cochran's test < 0.0001 for both outcomes). The large heterogeneity in pooled estimates was reduced after including adjusted estimates when available, and was explained by differences in methodological rigour and characteristics of included studies.

Conclusion

Among patients resuscitated from OHCA, early coronary angiography is associated with increased survival to discharge and favourable neurological outcome.

### Coronary angiography after cardiac arrest without ST-segment elevation [^1122YAV8]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2019). Excellent credibility.

Background

Ischemic heart disease is a major cause of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. The role of immediate coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in the treatment of patients who have been successfully resuscitated after cardiac arrest in the absence of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) remains uncertain.

Methods

In this multicenter trial, we randomly assigned 552 patients who had cardiac arrest without signs of STEMI to undergo immediate coronary angiography or coronary angiography that was delayed until after neurologic recovery. All patients underwent PCI if indicated. The primary end point was survival at 90 days. Secondary end points included survival at 90 days with good cerebral performance or mild or moderate disability, myocardial injury, duration of catecholamine support, markers of shock, recurrence of ventricular tachycardia, duration of mechanical ventilation, major bleeding, occurrence of acute kidney injury, need for renal-replacement therapy, time to target temperature, and neurologic status at discharge from the intensive care unit.

Results

At 90 days, 176 of 273 patients (64.5%) in the immediate angiography group and 178 of 265 patients (67.2%) in the delayed angiography group were alive (odds ratio, 0.89; 95% confidence interval, 0.62 to 1.27; P = 0.51). The median time to target temperature was 5.4 hours in the immediate angiography group and 4.7 hours in the delayed angiography group (ratio of geometric means, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.36). No significant differences between the groups were found in the remaining secondary end points.

Conclusions

Among patients who had been successfully resuscitated after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and had no signs of STEMI, a strategy of immediate angiography was not found to be better than a strategy of delayed angiography with respect to overall survival at 90 days.

### Coronary angiography after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest without ST-segment elevation: one-year outcomes of a randomized clinical trial [^117EtYUA]. JAMA Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

Importance

Myocardial infarction is a frequent cause of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). The long-term effect of early coronary angiography on patients with OHCA with possible coronary trigger but no ST-segment elevation remains unclear.

Objective

To compare the clinical outcomes of early unselective angiography with the clinical outcomes of a delayed or selective approach for successfully resuscitated patients with OHCA of presumed cardiac origin without ST-segment elevation at 1-year follow-up.

Design, Setting, and Participants

The TOMAHAWK trial was a multicenter, international (Germany and Denmark), investigator-initiated, open-label, randomized clinical trial enrolling 554 patients between November 23, 2016, to September 20, 2019. Patients with stable return of spontaneous circulation after OHCA of presumed cardiac origin but without ST-segment elevation on the postresuscitation electrocardiogram were eligible for inclusion. A total of 554 patients were randomized to either immediate coronary angiography after hospital admission or an initial intensive care assessment with delayed or selective angiography after a minimum of 24 hours. All 554 patients were included in survival analyses during the follow-up period of 1 year. Secondary clinical outcomes were assessed only for participants alive at 1 year to account for the competing risk of death.

Interventions

Early vs delayed or selective coronary angiography and revascularization if indicated.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Evaluations in this secondary analysis included all-cause mortality after 1 year, as well as severe neurologic deficit, myocardial infarction, and rehospitalization for congestive heart failure in survivors at 1 year.

Results

A total of 281 patients were randomized to the immediate angiography group and 273 to the delayed or selective group, with a median age of 70 years (IQR, 60–78 years). A total of 369 of 530 patients (69.6%) were male, and 268 of 483 patients (55.5%) had a shockable arrest rhythm. At 1 year, all-cause mortality was 60.8% (161 of 265) in the immediate angiography group and 54.3% (144 of 265) in the delayed or selective angiography group without significant difference between the treatment strategies, trending toward an increase in mortality with immediate angiography (hazard ratio, 1.25; 95% CI, 0.99–1.57; p = 0.05). For patients surviving until 1 year, the rates of severe neurologic deficit, myocardial infarction, and rehospitalization for congestive heart failure were similar between the groups.

Conclusions and Relevance

This study found that a strategy of immediate coronary angiography does not provide clinical benefit compared with a delayed or selective invasive approach for patients 1 year after resuscitated OHCA of presumed coronary cause and without ST-segment elevation.

### Acute coronary angiography in patients resuscitated from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest – a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116BbBsc]. Resuscitation (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest has a poor prognosis. The main aetiology is ischaemic heart disease.

Aim

To make a systematic review addressing the question: "In patients with return of spontaneous circulation following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, does acute coronary angiography with coronary intervention improve survival compared to conventional treatment?"

Methods

Peer reviewed articles written in English with relevant prognostic data were included. Comparison studies on patients with and without acute coronary angiography were pooled in a meta-analysis.

Results

Thirty-two non-randomised studies were included of which 22 were case-series without patients with conservative treatment. Seven studies with specific efforts to control confounding had statistical evidence to support the use of acute coronary angiography following resuscitation from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. The remaining 25 studies were considered neutral. Following acute coronary angiography, the survival to hospital discharge, 30 days or six months ranged from 23% to 86%. In patients without an obvious non-cardiac aetiology, the prevalence of significant coronary artery disease ranged from 59% to 71%. Electrocardiographic findings were unreliable for identifying angiographic findings of acute coronary syndrome. Ten comparison studies demonstrated a pooled unadjusted odds ratio for survival of 2.78 (1.89; 4.10) favouring acute coronary angiography.

Conclusion

No randomised studies exist on acute coronary angiography following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. An increasing number of observational studies support feasibility and a possible survival benefit of an early invasive approach. In patients without an obvious non-cardiac aetiology, acute coronary angiography should be strongly considered irrespective of electrocardiographic findings due to a high prevalence of coronary artery disease.

### Early coronary angiography and survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1144QQpT]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Current guidelines recommend early coronary angiography in patients with OHCA especially when an obvious non-cardiac cause is not present. The above benefit is possibly mediated by early PCI. Although our findings support the above recommendations, several randomised controlled trials are currently ongoing that would provide further evidence regarding the benefit of early coronary angiography in patients resuscitated from OHCA.

Our study findings should be interpreted in light of the following limitations. First, only four of the studies included in our meta-analysis were considered methodologically rigorous. Most studies only reported unadjusted association of early coronary angiography with survival and therefore potential for confounding remains. Second, although we included two large studies that were recently published and were methodologically more rigorous, half of the studies included in this meta-analysis were single-centre, retrospective, enrolled a few hundred patients and were generally of lower quality. Third, the pooled estimate from this meta-analysis needs to be interpreted in the context of statistical heterogeneity among included studies. To address this limitation, we included adjusted estimates when available and conducted stratified analyses and found that at least some of the heterogeneity between included studies was due to differences in methodological rigour and characteristics of included patients. Finally, although we found no evidence of publication bias using the funnel plot, it is still possible that studies that did not show a benefit of early coronary angiography may not have been published.

In conclusion, early coronary angiography is associated with survival to hospital discharge and favourable neurological survival in patients resuscitated from OHCA. In the absence of data from randomised controlled trials, our findings support clinical practice guidelines that recommend use of early coronary angiography as a means to improve survival in OHCA.

### Early coronary angiography and survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111x3GeN]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) affects nearly 400 000 patients each year in the United States and is associated with poor survival. Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is a common cause of OHCA especially in patients with ventricular arrhythmias. While early coronary angiography and revascularisation are the standard of care in AMI, uncertainty remains regarding the effectiveness of an early invasive strategy in patients with OHCA, particularly in patients without obvious signs of ischaemia on an ECG. This issue is of critical importance since a 12-lead ECG has been shown to be unreliable in diagnosing AMI in resuscitated patients. While a routine early invasive strategy in postarrest patients may be beneficial in restoring myocardial perfusion in such patients, its benefit may be counterbalanced with the risk of invasive procedures in patients in whom prognosis for neurological recovery may be unclear.

In the absence of data from randomised controlled trials, the evidence supporting a benefit of early coronary angiography in OHCA comes entirely from observational studies. Although most of these studies have shown early coronary angiography to be associated with improved survival, the magnitude of effect varies across studies. Likewise, previous meta-analyses have found early coronary angiography to be associated with survival in patients with OHCA. However, substantial heterogeneity was noted in the pooled survival estimate, which was not adequately explored. Moreover, the meta-analysis was further limited by inclusion of studies of patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA). Finally, since the publication of the previous meta-analyses, several large studies that collectively enrolled > 8000 patients and were methodologically rigorous have since been published.

Therefore, our overarching objective was to conduct an updated systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies that compared the use of early coronary angiography, defined as coronary angiography within 24 hours from the onset of cardiac arrest, and survival and neurological outcome in patients following successful resuscitation from OHCA, and determine the sources of heterogeneity in effect estimates observed in prior studies. Our hypothesis was that early coronary angiography would be associated with improved survival and neurological outcome in patients with OHCA. In addition, we hypothesised that heterogeneity in survival estimates noted in previous meta-analyses would be explained by differences in methodological rigour and patient characteristics of included studies.

### Coronary angiography after cardiac arrest without ST-segment elevation [^1163j6Zi]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2019). Excellent credibility.

The study COACT was published by Lemkes JS and colleagues in 2019 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Cardiac arrest. In the COACT study, the trial question was: what is the role of immediate coronary angiography and PCI in patients who have been successfully resuscitated after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in the absence of STEMI? In the COACT study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the COACT study, the population was: 552 patients (127 female, 425 male). The inclusion criteria were out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients without signs of STEMI. The key exclusion criteria were signs of STEMI on ECG, shock, noncoronary cause of arrest, severe renal dysfunction (GFR < 30 ml/min), pregnancy. In the COACT study, the interventions were: n = 273 immediate coronary angiography (initiated within 2 hours after randomization in addition to PCI, if indicated) n = 265 delayed coronary angiography (performed after neurologic recovery in addition to PCI, if indicated). In the COACT study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in the rate of survival at 90-days (64.5% vs. 67.2%; OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.27). In the COACT study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in remaining secondary end points. In the COACT study, the conclusion was: in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients without signs of STEMI, immediate coronary angiography was not superior to delayed coronary angiography with respect to the rate of survival at 90-days.

### Coronary angiography after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest without ST-segment elevation: one-year outcomes of a randomized clinical trial [^1178TTcZ]. JAMA Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

The study TOMAHAWK (1-year follow-up) was published by Steffen Desch and colleagues in 2023 in the journal JAMA Cardiol. This study is related to the following diseases: Cardiac arrest. In the TOMAHAWK (1-year follow-up) study, the trial question was: what is the role of immediate coronary angiography in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest without ST-segment elevation? In the TOMAHAWK (1-year follow-up) study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the TOMAHAWK (1-year follow-up) study, the population was: 530 patients (161 female, 369 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with stable return of spontaneous circulation after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest of presumed cardiac origin but without ST-segment elevation. The key exclusion criteria were hemodynamic or electrical instability; ST-segment elevation or new LBBB; in-hospital cardiac arrest; pregnancy. In the TOMAHAWK (1-year follow-up) study, the interventions were: n = 265 immediate coronary angiography (coronary angiography as soon as possible after hospital admission) n = 265 delayed or selective coronary angiography (initial intensive care assessment with coronary angiography ≥ 24 hours after hospital admission or not at all). In the TOMAHAWK (1-year follow-up) study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in the rate of death from all causes after 1 year (60.8% vs. 54.3%; HR 1.25, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.57). In the TOMAHAWK (1-year follow-up) study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in severe neurologic deficit in survivors at 1 year (13.5% vs. 9.2%; RR 1.47, 95% CI 0.66 to 3.26) No significant difference in myocardial infarction in survivors at 1 year (0% vs. 3%;) No significant difference in rehospitalization for congestive HF in survivors at 1 year (4.6% vs. 5%; RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.27 to 3.08). In the TOMAHAWK (1-year follow-up) study, the conclusion was: in patients with stable return of spontaneous circulation after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest of presumed cardiac origin but without ST-segment elevation, immediate coronary angiography was not superior to delayed or selective coronary angiography with respect to the rate of death from all causes after 1 year.

### One-year outcomes of coronary angiography after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest without ST elevation: an individual patient data meta-analysis [^112SnYcR]. JAMA Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Several randomized clinical trials (RCTs) assessed the effect of immediate vs delayed coronary angiography in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) without ST-segment elevations and found no difference in short-term survival. However, the association of these strategies with long-term outcomes and the identification of patient subgroups that might benefit from tailored approaches remain unclear.

Objective

To compare immediate vs delayed or selective coronary angiography treatment strategies for patients with OHCA without ST elevation and the effect on 1-year survival, and identify subgroups that may differ in treatment effect based on patient or clinical features.

Data Sources

Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, and Clarivate/Web of Science Core Collection were searched for relevant literature from inception to September 8, 2022.

Study Selection

RCTs investigating immediate vs delayed or selective coronary angiography after OHCA without ST-segment elevations and a minimum follow-up period of 1 year. Data were combined using the 1-stage individual participant data meta-analysis (IPDMA) approach.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Individual patient data were obtained from RCTs that met the eligibility criteria: COACT (Coronary Angiography After Cardiac Arrest) and TOMAHAWK (Immediate Unselected Coronary Angiography vs Delayed Triage in Survivors of Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest Without ST-Segment Elevation).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end point was 1-year survival. Secondary outcomes included the identification of variations in treatment effect using subgroup analysis (based on age, sex, arrest rhythm, witnessed arrest, time to basic life support, time to return of spontaneous circulation, and history of coronary artery disease, diabetes, and hypertension) and clinical outcomes (eg, myocardial infarction and heart failure) at 1 year.

Results

For the IPDMA, data were derived from 2 RCTs comprising a total of 1031 patients. In the immediate angiography group, 259 of 522 (49.6%) survived until 1 year vs 272 of 509 (53.4%) in the delayed or selective angiography group (stratified by randomized trial; hazard ratio, 1.15 [95% CI, 0.96–1.37). No treatment-by-subgroup interactions were identified that suggested heterogeneity between the 2 groups (P values for interaction ranged from P = .26 to P = .91 across subgroups).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this IPDMA of 2 RCTs, there was no benefit of immediate coronary angiography compared with a delayed or selective strategy during 1-year follow-up in successfully resuscitated patients with OHCA without ST-segment elevations. No subgroup of patients was identified that showed a differential treatment effect.

### Coronary angiography after cardiac arrest without ST segment elevation: one-year outcomes of the COACT randomized clinical trial [^116gz3ix]. JAMA Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Ischemic heart disease is a common cause of cardiac arrest. However, randomized data on long-term clinical outcomes of immediate coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients successfully resuscitated from cardiac arrest in the absence of ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) are lacking.

Objective

To determine whether immediate coronary angiography improves clinical outcomes at 1 year in patients after cardiac arrest without signs of STEMI, compared with a delayed coronary angiography strategy.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A prespecified analysis of a multicenter, open-label, randomized clinical trial evaluated 552 patients who were enrolled in 19 Dutch centers between January 8, 2015, and July 17, 2018. The study included patients who experienced out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with a shockable rhythm who were successfully resuscitated without signs of STEMI. Follow-up was performed at 1 year. Data were analyzed, using the intention-to-treat principle, between August 29 and October 10, 2019.

Interventions

Immediate coronary angiography and PCI if indicated or coronary angiography and PCI if indicated, delayed until after neurologic recovery.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Survival, myocardial infarction, revascularization, implantable cardiac defibrillator shock, quality of life, hospitalization for heart failure, and the composite of death or myocardial infarction or revascularization after 1 year.

Results

At 1 year, data on 522 of 552 patients (94.6%) were available for analysis. Of these patients, 413 were men (79.1%); mean (SD) age was 65.4 (12.3) years. A total of 162 of 264 patients (61.4%) in the immediate angiography group and 165 of 258 patients (64.0%) in the delayed angiography group were alive (odds ratio, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.63–1.28). The composite end point of death, myocardial infarction, or repeated revascularization since the index hospitalization was met in 112 patients (42.9%) in the immediate group and 104 patients (40.6%) in the delayed group (odds ratio, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.77–1.56). No significant differences between the groups were observed for the other outcomes at 1-year follow-up. For example, the rate of ICD shocks was 20.4% in the immediate group and 16.2% in the delayed group (odds ratio, 1.32; 95% CI, 0.66–2.64).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this trial of patients successfully resuscitated after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and without signs of STEMI, a strategy of immediate angiography was not found to be superior to a strategy of delayed angiography with respect to clinical outcomes at 1 year. Coronary angiography in this patient group can therefore be delayed until after neurologic recovery without affecting outcomes.

### Immediate unselected coronary angiography versus delayed triage in survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest without ST-segment elevation: design and rationale of the TOMAHAWK trial [^113fJzLV]. American Heart Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Patients experiencing out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) without ST-segment elevation are a heterogenic group with a variety of underlying causes. Up to one-third of patients display a significant coronary lesion compatible with myocardial infarction as OHCA trigger. There are no randomized data on patient selection and timing of invasive coronary angiography after admission. METHODS AND RESULTS: The TOMAHAWK trial randomly assigns 558 patients with return of spontaneous circulation after OHCA with no obvious extracardiac origin of cardiac arrest and no ST-segment elevation/left bundle-branch block on postresuscitation electrocardiogram to either immediate coronary angiography or initial intensive care assessment with delayed/selective angiography in a 1:1 ratio. The primary end point is 30-day all-cause mortality. Secondary analyses will be performed with respect to initial rhythm, electrocardiographic patterns, myocardial infarction as underlying cause, neurological outcome, as well as clinical and laboratory markers. Clinical follow-up will be performed at 6 and 12 months. Safety end points include bleeding and stroke. CONCLUSION: The TOMAHAWK trial will address the unresolved issue of timing and general indication of angiography after OHCA without ST-segment elevation.

### Angiography after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest without ST-segment elevation [^116Y8tMa]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2021). Excellent credibility.

Background

Myocardial infarction is a frequent cause of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. However, the benefits of early coronary angiography and revascularization in resuscitated patients without electrocardiographic evidence of ST-segment elevation are unclear.

Methods

In this multicenter trial, we randomly assigned 554 patients with successfully resuscitated out-of-hospital cardiac arrest of possible coronary origin to undergo either immediate coronary angiography (immediate-angiography group) or initial intensive care assessment with delayed or selective angiography (delayed-angiography group). All the patients had no evidence of ST-segment elevation on postresuscitation electrocardiography. The primary end point was death from any cause at 30 days. Secondary end points included a composite of death from any cause or severe neurologic deficit at 30 days.

Results

A total of 530 of 554 patients (95.7%) were included in the primary analysis. At 30 days, 143 of 265 patients (54.0%) in the immediate-angiography group and 122 of 265 patients (46.0%) in the delayed-angiography group had died (hazard ratio, 1.28; 95% confidence interval, 1.00 to 1.63; P = 0.06). The composite of death or severe neurologic deficit occurred more frequently in the immediate-angiography group (in 164 of 255 patients [64.3%]) than in the delayed-angiography group (in 138 of 248 patients [55.6%]), for a relative risk of 1.16 (95% CI, 1.00 to 1.34). Values for peak troponin release and for the incidence of moderate or severe bleeding, stroke, and renal-replacement therapy were similar in the two groups.

Conclusions

Among patients with resuscitated out-of-hospital cardiac arrest without ST-segment elevation, a strategy of performing immediate angiography provided no benefit over a delayed or selective strategy with respect to the 30-day risk of death from any cause.

### Timing and outcomes after coronary angiography following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest without signs of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [^112D8RYp]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

There is broad consensus that resuscitated out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) should receive immediate coronary angiography (CAG); however, factors that guide patient selection and optimal timing of CAG for post-arrest patients without evidence of STEMI remain incompletely described.

Objective

We sought to describe the timing of post-arrest CAG in actual practice, patient characteristics associated with decision to perform immediate vs. delayed CAG, and patient outcomes after CAG.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study at seven U.S. academic hospitals. Resuscitated adult patients with OHCA were included if they presented between January 1, 2015 and December 31, 2019 and received CAG during hospitalization. Emergency medical services run sheets and hospital records were analyzed. Patients without evidence of STEMI were grouped and compared based on time from arrival to CAG performance into "early" (≤ 6 h) and "delayed" (> 6 h).

Results

Two hundred twenty-one patients were included. Median time to CAG was 18.6 h (interquartile range [IQR] 1.5–94.6 h). Early catheterization was performed on 94 patients (42.5%) and delayed catheterization was performed on 127 patients (57.5%). Patients in the early group were older (61 years [IQR 55–70 years] vs. 57 years [IQR 47–65] years) and more likely to be male (79.8% vs. 59.8%). Those in the early group were more likely to have clinically significant lesions (58.5% vs. 39.4%) and receive revascularization (41.5% vs. 19.7%). Patients were more likely to die in the early group (47.9% vs. 33.1%). Among survivors, there was no significant difference in neurologic recovery at discharge.

Conclusions

OHCA patients without evidence of STEMI who received early CAG were older and more likely to be male. This group was more likely to have intervenable lesions and receive revascularization.

### Coronary angiography after cardiac arrest: rationale and design of the COACT trial [^111f6PTQ]. American Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Ischemic heart disease is a major cause of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. The role of immediate coronary angiography (CAG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) after restoration of spontaneous circulation following cardiac arrest in the absence of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) remains debated.

Hypothesis

We hypothesize that immediate CAG and PCI, if indicated, will improve 90-day survival in post-cardiac arrest patients without signs of STEMI.

Design

In a prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled clinical trial, 552 post-cardiac arrest patients with restoration of spontaneous circulation and without signs of STEMI will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to immediate CAG and PCI (within 2 hours) versus initial deferral with CAG and PCI after neurological recovery. The primary end point of the study is 90-day survival. The secondary end points will include 90-day survival with good cerebral performance or minor/moderate disability, myocardial injury, duration of inotropic support, occurrence of acute kidney injury, need for renal replacement therapy, time to targeted temperature control, neurological status at intensive care unit discharge, markers of shock, recurrence of ventricular tachycardia, duration of mechanical ventilation, and reasons for discontinuation of treatment.

Summary

The COACT trial is a multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical study that will evaluate the effect of an immediate invasive coronary strategy in post-cardiac arrest patients without STEMI on 90-day survival.

### The effect of immediate coronary angiography after cardiac arrest without ST-segment elevation on left ventricular function. A sub-study of the COACT randomised trial [^112BwQ6b]. Resuscitation (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The effect of immediate coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients who are successfully resuscitated after cardiac arrest in the absence of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) on left ventricular function is currently unknown.

Methods

This prespecified sub-study of a multicentre trial evaluated 552 patients, successfully resuscitated from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest without signs of STEMI. Patients were randomized to either undergo immediate coronary angiography or delayed coronary angiography, after neurologic recovery. All patients underwent PCI if indicated. The main outcomes of this analysis were left ventricular ejection fraction and end-diastolic and systolic volumes assessed by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging or echocardiography.

Results

Data on left ventricular function was available for 397 patients. The mean (± standard deviation) left ventricular ejection fraction was 45.2% (± 12.8) in the immediate angiography group and 48.4% (± 13.2) in the delayed angiography group (mean difference: -3.19; 95% confidence interval, -6.75 to 0.37). Median left ventricular end-diastolic volume was 177 mL in the immediate angiography group compared to 169 mL in the delayed angiography group (ratio of geometric means: 1.06; 95% CI, 0.95–1.19). In addition, mean left ventricular end-systolic volume was 90 mL in the immediate angiography group compared to 78 mL in the delayed angiography group (ratio of geometric means: 1.13; 95% CI 0.97–1.32).

Conclusion

In patients successfully resuscitated after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and without signs of STEMI, immediate coronary angiography was not found to improve left ventricular dimensions or function compared with a delayed angiography strategy.

### Critical care management of patients after cardiac arrest: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association and Neurocritical Care Society [^111iYwa8]. Circulation (2024). Medium credibility.

Early coronary angiography for patients resuscitated after out-of-hospital CA is safe and reasonable, and although it did not improve outcomes in these RCTs, it can identify potential coronary culprit lesions that could benefit from timely reperfusion and revascularization. The incidence of such acutely occluded culprit lesions has varied by study, and the final answer remains to be determined. This is an important area for future research. On the basis of existing data, survival may not be the only important end point. Timely reperfusion of an acutely occluded culprit coronary artery is also key because it salvages at-risk myocardium and may prevent rearrest and the subsequent development of heart failure in survivors. Quality of life is improved with preserving left ventricular function and ultimately avoiding heart failure, with its life-altering limitations.

### Emergency coronary angiography in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients without STEMI [^113NeXmV]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Current guideline recommends that immediate coronary angiography (CAG) should be considered in all postcardiac arrest patients in whom acute coronary syndrome is suspected. In the setting of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), obtaining clinical data such as chest discomfort and medical diseases associated with acute coronary syndrome can be difficult. Therefore, emergency physicians depend on electrocardiographic findings after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) when they have to decide whether emergency CAG should be performed. In clinical practice, the usefulness of emergency CAG evaluation of OHCA patients without ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction is debatable. We describe 2 OHCA patients who did not exhibit ST-segment elevation after ROSC and received underwent emergency CAG.

### Utility and challenges of an early invasive strategy in patients resuscitated from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest [^114QrSRP]. JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions (2019). Medium credibility.

Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is frequently triggered by acute myocardial ischemia. Coronary angiography is an important component of post-resuscitation care for patients with OHCA without an evident noncardiac cause, to identify underlying coronary artery disease and allow revascularization. Most patients undergoing coronary angiography after OHCA have obstructive coronary artery disease, and nearly one-half of patients have acute coronary occlusion. Early coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention after OHCA have been associated with improved survival in observational studies, but these studies demonstrate selection bias, and randomized trials are lacking. Selection of patients for coronary angiography after OHCA can be challenging, particularly in comatose patients whose outcomes are driven primarily by anoxic brain injury. As for other patients with acute coronary syndromes, patients with ST-segment elevation after OHCA have a high probability of acute coronary occlusion warranting emergent coronary angiography. Patients with cardiogenic shock after OHCA are a high-risk population also requiring emergent coronary angiography. Among patients in stable condition after OHCA without ST-segment elevation, other clinical predictors can be used to identify those needing early coronary angiography to identify obstructive coronary artery disease. Despite the challenges with early neurological prognostication in comatose patients with OHCA, those with multiple objective markers of poor prognosis appear less likely to benefit from revascularization, and early coronary angiography may be reasonably deferred in appropriately selected patients meeting these criteria. The authors propose an algorithm to guide patient selection for coronary angiography after OHCA that combines clinical predictors of acute coronary occlusion and early clinical predictors of severe brain injury.

### EMERGEncy versus delayed coronary angiogram in survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with no obvious non-cardiac cause of arrest: design of the EMERGE trial [^116Lvq35]. American Heart Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

In adults, the most common cause of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCA) is acute coronary artery occlusion. If an immediate coronary angiogram (CAG) is recommended for survivors presenting a ST segment elevation on the electrocardiogram (ECG) performed after resuscitation, there is still a debate regarding the best strategy in patients without ST segment elevation.

Hypothesis

Performing an immediate CAG after an OHCA without ST segment elevation on the post-resuscitation ECG and no obvious non-cardiac cause of arrest could lead to a better 180-day survival rate with no or minimal neurological sequel as compared with a delayed CAG performed 48 to 96 hours after the arrest.

Design

The EMERGE trial is a prospective national, randomized, open and parallel group trial, in which 970 survivors of OHCA will be randomized (1:1) to either immediate (as soon as possible after return of spontaneous circulation) or delayed (48 to 96 h) CAG. Participants will be OHCA patients with no ST segment elevation on the post resuscitation ECG and no obvious non-cardiac cause of arrest. The primary endpoint of the study is the 180-day survival rate with no or minimal neurological sequel corresponding to Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) 1 or 2. The secondary endpoints are: occurrence of shock during the first 48 hours, ventricular tachycardia and/or fibrillation during the first 48 hours, change in left ventricular ejection fraction between baseline and 180 days assessed by echocardiogram, neurological status evaluated by the CPC score at intensive care unit (ICU) discharge and day 90 neurological status assessed by the Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended score (GOSE) at 90 and 180 days, overall survival rate, and hospital length of stay.

Summary

The EMERGE trial is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled trial that will assess the 180-day survival rate with no or minimal neurologic sequel in patients resuscitated from an OHCA without ST segment elevation and who will be managed with either immediate or delayed CAG.

### Early coronary angiography in patients resuscitated from out of hospital cardiac arrest without ST-segment elevation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111L4jzG]. Resuscitation (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

A meta-analysis of published studies was performed to determine the impact of performing early versus delayed or no coronary angiography in patients without ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction following out of hospital cardiac arrest.

Methods

A structured search was conducted using Medline, Embase and Ovid by two independent investigators using a variety of keywords. The primary outcome was short term (at discharge) and long term (at 6–14 months follow-up) mortality whereas the secondary end-point was good neurological outcome (defined as a Cerebral Performance Category Score of 1 or 2), at discharge and follow up. Random-effects model was utilized to pool the data, whilst publication bias was assessed using funnel plot.

Results

A total of 8 studies (7 observational studies and 1 randomized control trial) were identified and incorporated into the meta-analysis. The use of early angiography was associated with decreased short term (OR = 0.46, 95% CI = 0.36–0.56, P < 0.001) and long term (OR = 0.59, 95%CI = 0.44–0.74, P < 0.001) mortality. Early angiography was also shown to be associated with improved neurological outcomes on discharge (OR = 2.00, 95% CI = 1.50–2.49, P < 0.001) as well as on follow-up (OR = 1.48, 95% CI = 1.06–1.90, P < 0.001).

Conclusion

The results of our meta-analysis support the use of early coronary angiography in out of hospital cardiac-arrest patients presenting without ST-segment elevation on the post-resuscitation electrocardiogram. However, given the low level of evidence of available studies, future guideline changes should be directed by the results of large-scale randomized clinical trials on the subject matter.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for cardiac arrest, more specifically with respect to post-resuscitation evaluation, coronary angiography, ESC 2021 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining delayed as opposed to immediate angiography in hemodynamically stable patients without ST-segment elevation successfully resuscitated after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.

### Early coronary angiography and survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111S8YkD]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this updated meta-analysis, we found that the use of early coronary angiography was associated with higher odds of survival to discharge and favourable neurological survival in patients successfully resuscitated from an OHCA. The observed heterogeneity in pooled estimates was explained, in part, by differences in patient characteristics and methodological rigour of included studies. The overall association of early coronary angiography with improved survival in OHCA was consistent in studies which explicitly accounted for selection bias. However, given the potential for unmeasured confounding variables in observational studies, data from randomised clinical trials would be informative.

Previous meta-analyses have also shown early coronary angiography to be associated with survival. However, we build on these prior findings in a number of important ways. First, prior meta-analyses were conducted before the recent publication of the two largest studieswhich included 3981 and 4029 patients, respectively. Prior to the publication of these two studies, the largest study that examined the use of early coronary angiography in OHCA included less than 1000 patients. Due to limited sample size, most studies included in the previous meta-analysis only reported unadjusted outcomes as they lacked the statistical power needed to account for selection bias. Given that patients more likely to survive may be more likely to undergo coronary angiography, it is conceivable that the benefit of early coronary angiography was overestimated in such studies. This may explain why the pooled OR of 1.91 in our study, which included adjusted outcomes when available, is lower in our meta-analysis than reported in the previous meta-analyses (OR 2.77 and 2.78). Second, unlike previous meta-analyses which also included studies that examined use of early coronary angiography in patients with IHCA, we only focused on patients with OHCA. This is important because the aetiology, response time and survival rate for IHCA are markedly different compared with patients with OHCA, which may bias the association of early coronary angiography with survival in studies that include patients with IHCA and OHCA. Finally, the large heterogeneity in previous meta-analyses limited the interpretability of the pooled estimate from prior studies. Although statistical heterogeneity was still present in our analysis, we found that the heterogeneity in the effect estimates was driven at least in part by differences in methodological rigour and included patient characteristics.

### Post-resuscitation ECG for selection of patients for immediate coronary angiography in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest [^114krEuJ]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2015). Low credibility.

Background

We aimed to investigate coronary angiographic findings in unselected out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients referred to immediate coronary angiography (ICA) irrespective of their first postresuscitation ECG and to determine whether this ECG is useful to select patients with no need of ICA.

Methods and Results

All resuscitated patients admitted after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest without a clear noncardiac cause underwent ICA. Patients were retrospectively grouped according to the postresuscitation ECG blinded for ICA results: (1) ST elevation or presumably new left bundle branch block, (2) other ECG signs indicating myocardial ischemia, and (3) no ECG signs indicating myocardial ischemia. All coronary angiograms were reevaluated blinded for postresuscitation ECGs. Two hundred and ten patients were included with mean age 62 ± 12 years. Six-months survival with good neurological outcome was 54%. Reduced Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction flow (0–2) was found in 55%, 34%, and 18% and a ≥ 90% coronary stenosis was present in 25%, 27%, and 19% of patients in group 1, 2, and 3, respectively. An acute coronary occlusion was found in 11% of patients in group 3. ST elevation/left bundle branch block identified patients with reduced Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (0–2) flow with 70% sensitivity and 62% specificity. Among patients with initial nonshockable rhythms (24%), 32% had significantly reduced Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction flow.

Conclusions

Initial ECG findings are not reliable in detecting patients with an indication for ICA after experiencing a cardiac arrest. Even in the absence of ECG changes indicating myocardial ischemia, an acute culprit lesion may be present and patients may benefit from emergent revascularization.

### Outcomes of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest at centers with and without on-site coronary angiography: a Nationwide analysis [^111iNENw]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

The AHA has long emphasized the need for regionalized care systems to optimize outcomes in cardiac arrest. Within this framework, Level I resuscitation centers are designated as facilities equipped to provide comprehensive, evidence‐based postresuscitation care, including 24/7 access to PCI. The 8.5% absolute mortality difference observed in our study between patients with OHCA admitted to facilities with versus without onsite coronary angiography highlights the potential role of centers with coronary angiography capability within the AHA model. Among those admitted to coronary angiography capable centers, 12.8% underwent coronary angiography, 4.3% received PCI, 4.1% required mechanical circulatory support, and 1.3% underwent coronary artery bypass graft, whereas none of these interventions were performed at hospitals without onsite coronary angiography. This difference is notable given that 1.1%, 6.6%, and 6.5% of patients at centers without onsite coronary angiography presented with STEMI, NSTEMI, and cardiogenic shock, respectively. Many of these patients would likely have benefited from coronary angiography to assess revascularization candidacy and from mechanical circulatory support to optimize hemodynamics. Moreover, although the COACT (Coronary Angiography After Cardiac Arrest) and TOMAHAWK (Immediate Unselected Coronary Angiography Versus Delayed Triage in Survivors of Out‐of‐Hospital Cardiac Arrest Without ST‐Segment Elevation) randomized control trials did not demonstrate a mortality benefit for immediate coronary angiography over delayed or selective strategy in patients with OHCA without STEMI, a substantial proportion of patients in the delayed or selective arm in these trials ultimately proceeded to invasive evaluation – 64.9% (172/265) in COACT and 62.2% (165/265) in TOMAHAWK – with 24.2% (64/265) and 26.4% (70/265) of patients undergoing PCI, respectively. Therefore, onsite coronary angiography capability remains vital in managing patients with OHCA whose clinical presentation ultimately suggests a cardiac cause. Beyond procedural gaps, the improved outcomes observed at centers with onsite coronary angiography in our study may reflect the broader availability of institutional resources, including specialized cardiac critical care units and adherence to standardized postarrest care pathways. Although these factors were not directly evaluated in our study, they likely contribute to the observed survival difference, emphasizing the essential role of centers with onsite coronary angiography in delivering high‐quality postresuscitation care.

### Angiography after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest without ST-segment elevation [^111VJB1z]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2021). Excellent credibility.

The study TOMAHAWK was published by Steffen Desch and colleagues in 2021 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Cardiac arrest. In the TOMAHAWK study, the trial question was: is immediate angiography superior to delayed angiography in patients with resuscitated out-of-hospital cardiac arrest without ST-segment elevation? In the TOMAHAWK study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the TOMAHAWK study, the population was: 530 patients (161 female, 369 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with successfully resuscitated out-of-hospital cardiac arrest of possible cardiac origin. The key exclusion criteria were ST-segment elevation or new LBBB; no return of spontaneous circulation upon hospital admission; the need for immediate coronary angiography/intervention; obvious extra-cardiac etiology or in-hospital cardiac arrest. In the TOMAHAWK study, the interventions were: n = 265 immediate-angiography (immediate coronary angiography) n = 265 delayed-angiography (initial intensive care assessment with delayed or selective angiography). In the TOMAHAWK study, the primary outcome was: borderline significant increase in death from any cause at day 30 (54% vs. 46%; HR 1.28, 95% CI 1 to 1.63). In the TOMAHAWK study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in death or severe neurologic deficit at day 30 (64.3% vs. 55.6%; RR 1.16, 95% CI 1 to 1.34) No significant difference in myocardial infarction (0% vs. 0.8%;) No significant difference in severe neurologic deficit (18.8% vs. 12.7%; RR 1.48, 95% CI 0.82 to 2.67). In the TOMAHAWK study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in moderate or severe bleeding, stroke, acute kidney failure leading to RRT. In the TOMAHAWK study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with successfully resuscitated out-of-hospital cardiac arrest of possible cardiac origin, immediate-angiography was inferior to delayed-angiography with respect to death from any cause at day 30.

### Early coronary angiography in patients after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest without ST-segment elevation: meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^112fbEWV]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To compare early coronary angiography to a delayed or selective approach in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) without ST-segment elevation of possible cardiac cause by means of meta-analysis of available randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

Methods

We searched MEDLINE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for RCTs comparing early with delayed or selective coronary angiography in OHCA patients of possible cardiac origin without ST-segment elevation. The primary endpoint was all-cause short-term mortality (PROSPERO CRD42021271484).

Results

The search strategy identified three RCTs enrolling a total of 1167 patients. An early invasive approach was not associated with improved short-term mortality (odds ratio 1.19, 95% confidence interval 0.94–1.52; p = 0.15). Further, no significant differences were shown with respect to the risk of severe neurological deficit, the composite of all-cause mortality or severe neurological deficit, need for renal replacement therapy due to acute renal failure, and significant bleeding at short-term follow-up.

Conclusion

Early coronary angiography in OHCA without ST-segment elevation is not superior compared to a delayed/selective approach.

### Advances in the hospital management of patients following an out of hospital cardiac arrest [^1171bz1v]. Heart (2012). Low credibility.

The outcome for patients after an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) has been poor over many decades and single interventions have mostly resulted in disappointing results. More recently, some regions have observed better outcomes after redesigning their cardiac arrest pathways. Optimised resuscitation and prehospital care is absolutely key, but in-hospital care appears to be at least as important. OHCA treatment requires a multidisciplinary approach, comparable to trauma care; the development of cardiac arrest pathways and cardiac arrest centres may dramatically improve patient care and outcomes. Besides emergency medicine physicians, intensivists and neurologists, cardiologists are playing an increasingly crucial role in the post-resuscitation management, especially by optimising cardiac output and undertaking urgent coronary angiography/intervention.

Despite advances in resuscitation and intensive care medicine, outcomes following out‐of‐hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) have remained poor, with survival rates of < 40% even among those successfully resuscitated. The most common cause of OHCA overall is coronary artery disease (CAD). Up to 70% of patients with OHCA and shockable rhythm are found to have a culprit lesion on coronary angiography (CA). In our prior analysis of patients with OHCA and shockable rhythm, 67% of those with ST‐segment elevation (STE) on initial electrocardiogram (ECG) who underwent CA proceeded with ad hoc percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to a culprit lesion. Current international consensus recommends immediate CA and revascularization in patients with resuscitated OHCA and STE on initial ECG (class of recommendation I, level of evidence B). For OHCA patients without STE, the benefit of CA remains disputed in the contemporary literature. Observational evidence is conflicting in this cohort, with some studies indicating early CA to be associated with reduced mortality and others suggesting a lack of benefit. Four recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) completed among patients without STE following OHCA have demonstrated no difference in survival whether CA was performed early or delayed. One RCT excluded nonshockable rhythmsand two RCTs were noted to be underpowered. Adverse prognostic indicators have been previously described for the general cohort with OHCA and shockable rhythm, however, these variables are poorly defined among those without STE. While high‐level evidence is limited, real‐world practice of patient selection for CA remains largely dependent on individual physician judgment. Therefore, we aimed to identify characteristics associated with patient selection for CA, and to determine adverse predictors of in‐hospital mortality, including the effect and timing of undertaking CA, in patients with OHCA, shockable rhythm and no STE.

### Early coronary angiography and survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116VdexM]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

The study was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology checklist (online supplementary table 1). An experienced health sciences librarian ran extensive literature searches in MEDLINE via Ovid, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials.gov between 1 January 1990 and 18 January 2017. We restricted our search to studies published after 1990, since coronary angiography and percutaneous revascularisation had not been incorporated into clinical care for emergent conditions like AMI until that period. Search terms included subject headings and keywords for cardiac arrest, asystole, sudden cardiac death, coronary angiography, cardiac catheterisation, coronary angioplasty and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). No filters for language were applied to the searches. Full search strategies from all databases are listed in the (online supplementary appendix). We also reviewed the references from all included articles to identify additional studies that were not identified in the initial search.

Study selection

To be included in the meta-analysis, studies were required to meet the following inclusion criteria: (1) restricted to patients with OHCA in studies and excluded patients with IHCA, (2) included an exposure group that underwent early coronary angiography within 24 hours of cardiac arrest, (3) included a concurrent control group that did not undergo early coronary angiography (may undergo coronary angiography 24 hours after OHCA or not undergo coronary angiography at all), and (4) reported at least one of the following as an outcome: in-hospital survival, 30-day survival or in-hospital survival with favourable neurological outcome. We excluded studies that were case reports, review articles, commentaries, guidelines, studies that combined both IHCA and OHCA, studies that did not identify patients undergoing early coronary angiography separately from patients undergoing coronary angiography at any point during the hospital course, studies that did not include a concurrent control group (eg, historical control), and studies that compared outcomes in patients according to receipt of PCI rather than early coronary angiography (figure 1).

### Randomized pilot clinical trial of early coronary angiography versus No early coronary angiography after cardiac arrest without ST-segment elevation: the PEARL study [^113f6aNF]. Circulation (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The benefit of emergency coronary angiography after resuscitation from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is uncertain for patients without ST-segment elevation. The aim of this randomized trial was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of early coronary angiography and to determine the prevalence of acute coronary occlusion in resuscitated patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest without ST-segment elevation.

Methods

Adult (> 18 years) comatose survivors without ST-segment elevation after resuscitation from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest were prospectively randomized in a 1:1 fashion under exception to informed consent regulations to early coronary angiography versus no early coronary angiography in this multicenter study. Early angiography was defined as ≤ 120 minutes from arrival at the percutaneous coronary intervention-capable facility. The primary end point was a composite of efficacy and safety measures, including efficacy measures of survival to discharge, favorable neurologic status at discharge (Cerebral Performance Category score ≤ 2), echocardiographic measures of left ventricular ejection fraction > 50%, and a normal regional wall motion score of 16 within 24 hours of admission. Adverse events included rearrest, pulmonary edema on chest x-ray, acute renal dysfunction, bleeding requiring transfusion or intervention, hypotension (systolic arterial pressure ≤ 90 mmHg), and pneumonia. Secondary end points included the incidence of culprit vessels with acute occlusion.

Results

The study was terminated prematurely before enrolling the target number of patients. A total of 99 patients were enrolled from 2015 to 2018, including 75 with initially shockable rhythms. Forty-nine patients were randomized to early coronary angiography. The primary end point of efficacy and safety was not different between the 2 groups (55.1% versus 46.0%; P = 0.64). Early coronary angiography was not associated with any significant increase in survival (55.1% versus 48.0%; P = 0.55) or adverse events (26.5% versus 26.0%; P = 1.00). Early coronary angiography revealed a culprit vessel in 47%, with a total of 14% of patients undergoing early coronary angiography having an acutely occluded culprit coronary artery.

Conclusions

This underpowered study, when considered together with previous clinical trials, does not support early coronary angiography for comatose survivors of cardiac arrest without ST elevation. Whether early detection of occluded potential culprit arteries leads to interventions that improve outcomes requires additional study.

### SCAI expert consensus statement on out of hospital cardiac arrest [^116GVzVY]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2020). High credibility.

SCAI expert consensus on out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) frames the clinical scope by stating OHCA is a major public health problem with high mortality and morbidity and that improving survival with good neurological outcomes requires optimized response times and quality of care across the chain of survival. Given the high prevalence of coronary artery disease as a cause of arrest in patients with ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia, interventional cardiologists are often consulted to consider emergent coronary angiography and possible percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Emergent angiography and PCI are indicated in selected OHCA patients when a post resuscitation electrocardiogram (ECG) shows ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), though practice varies for those without STEMI on post resuscitation ECG. The cardiac catheterization laboratory role includes angiography and PCI as well as hemodynamic assessment and mechanical circulatory support (MCS) device use in patients with concomitant cardiogenic shock (CS). The document aims to provide an evidence-based and patient-oriented recommendation for management and was developed according to SCAI Publications Committee policies, including disclosure and management of relationships with industry, and internal and external review with organizational approval.

### Benefit of immediate coronary angiography after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in France: a nationwide propensity score analysis from the RéAC registry [^1168J93f]. Resuscitation (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The survival rate of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) remains extremely low, generally under 10%. Post-resuscitation care, and particularly early coronary reperfusion, may improve this outcome. The main objective of the present study was to determine whether patients with immediate coronary angiography at hospital admission (CAA) had a better outcome than patients without immediate CAA.

Methods

This cohort analysis study was based on data extracted from the French National Cardiac Arrest registry (RéAC). To control for attribution bias, patients were matched using a propensity score, which included age clusters, low flow and no flow delays, initial rhythm and bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). The main endpoint was survival at day 30 (D30). Secondary endpoint was neurological recovery of survivors assessed by the Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) scale, with CPC 1 and 2 at D30 considered as a favorable outcome.

Results

From July 1st, 2011 to October 1st, 2016, 63394 OHCA were registered in the database, of which 39444 were of an unknown or suspected cardiac origin. After on-site resuscitation by a mobile medical team, 7584 patients were transported to a hospital facility. Among these patients, 4046 were retained in the analysis after matching for the aforementioned factors and constituted into 2 groups: immediate coronary angiography (iCAA) group (n = 2023) and non-immediate coronary angiography (niCAA) group (n = 2023). The survival rate at D30 after matching was 43.3% in the iCAA group versus 34.5% in the niCAA group (OD = 0.66 [0.58; 0.75], p < 0.001). In the iCAA group, (n = 707) 36% of the patients at D30 were CPC 1–2 comparatively to (n = 539) 27.3% in the niCAA group (p < 0.01).

Conclusions

Both the survival and proportion of patients with favorable neurological recovery were significantly higher in patients who underwent an immediate coronary angiography after a resuscitated OHCA. These observational results warrant further exploration of the benefit of this invasive strategy in randomized studies.

### Direct or subacute coronary angiography in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (DISCO)-an initial pilot-study of a randomized clinical trial [^115By88A]. Resuscitation (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The clinical importance of immediate coronary angiography, with potentially subsequent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients without ST-elevation on the ECG is unclear. In this study, we assessed feasibility and safety aspects of performing immediate coronary angiography in a pre-specified pilot phase of the 'DIrect or Subacute Coronary angiography in Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest' (DISCO) randomized controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT02309151).

Methods

Resuscitated bystander witnessed OHCA patients > 18 years without ST-elevation on the ECG were randomized to immediate coronary angiography versus standard of care. Event times, procedure related adverse events and safety variables within 7 days were recorded.

Results

In total, 79 patients were randomized to immediate angiography (n = 39) or standard of care (n = 40). No major differences in baseline characteristics between the groups were found. There were no differences in the proportion of bleedings and renal failure. Three patients randomized to immediate angiography and six patients randomized to standard care died within 24h. The median time from EMS arrival to coronary angiography was 135min in the immediate angiography group. In patients randomized to immediate angiography a culprit lesion was found in 14/38 (36.8%) and PCI was performed in all these patients. In 6/40 (15%) patients randomized to standard of care, coronary angiography was performed before the stipulated 3 days.

Conclusion

In this out-of-hospital cardiac arrest population without ST-elevation, randomization to a strategy to perform immediate coronary angiography was feasible although the time window of 120min from EMS arrival at the scene of the arrest to start of coronary angiography was not achieved. No significant safety issues were reported.

### Critical care management of patients after cardiac arrest: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association and Neurocritical Care Society [^116SWFfD]. Circulation (2024). Medium credibility.

Cardiac Catheterization

There is reasonable consensus that early coronary angiography (performed within the first 6 hours) is safe and beneficial for post-CA care, although the majority of such data are from nonrandomized cohort studies. – Patients with ST-segment elevation on their ECG after resuscitation have an acutely occluded coronary at early coronary angiography nearly 80% of the time, which is similar to those with ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction not complicated by out-of-hospital CA. The current AHA guidelines recommend early coronary angiography for patients with ST-segment elevation on their ECG after CA, even if comatose with an unknown neurological prognosis. Nonrandomized registry reports suggest that both short-term and longer-term outcomes are improved in patients with CA and ST-segment elevation undergoing early coronary angiography and intervention. –

There is less agreement about the utility of early coronary angiography after out-of-hospital CA in patients without ST-segment elevation. This is an important issue because the majority (> 70%) of all resuscitated individuals with out-of-hospital CA do not have ST-segment elevation. A substantial amount of literature on nonrandomized cohort studies in post-CA patients without ST-segment elevation exists, as it does for those with ST-segment elevation. At least 10 000 patients have been included in such before-and-after cohort reports.– The overall results suggest that early coronary angiography is both safe and beneficial, including for improved survival and functional neurological status, among post-CA patients without ST-segment elevation. However, the proportion of post-CA patients without ST-segment elevation having an acutely occluded coronary culprit vessel is ≈20% to 30%.– This lower proportion has led to a less emphatic AHA recommendation.

### Outcomes of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest at centers with and without on-site coronary angiography: a Nationwide analysis [^11541FTJ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

The AHA tiered framework for regionalized OHCA care offers a pragmatic approach to addressing geospatial challenges often faced in rural settings. When direct transport to a Level I center is not feasible, the guidelines recommend admission to designated Level II resuscitation referral centers to achieve a return of spontaneous circulation, initiate targeted temperature management, and optimize hemodynamics, followed by immediate transfer to Level I centers for advanced postresuscitation care through an established interfacility transport network. Our secondary analysis supports the feasibility of this model, demonstrating that patients with OHCA transferred to coronary angiography‐capable centers achieved survival outcomes comparable to those directly admitted to these centers. This finding suggests that, when feasible, timely interfacility transfers can mitigate the disadvantages of initial presentation to resource‐limited hospitals. It remains important to note that the potential for survivorship bias in the transfer cohort and the lack of data on the transferring facilities warrant cautious interpretation. Nonetheless, these results emphasize the critical role of coordinated referral pathways, particularly in rural regions, to ensure equitable access to the time‐sensitive, lifesaving interventions available at centers with coronary angiography capability.

### Emergent percutaneous coronary intervention for resuscitated victims of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest [^113sb7qY]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2010). Low credibility.

Long-term survival rates even after successful resuscitation from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest are dismal. Most of those initially resuscitated expired during their hospitalization. Recent reports have suggested that a more aggressive approach to postresuscitation care is the key to better outcome. Waiting for the evidence of neurological recovery before acting can result in missed opportunity to improve such recovery. Immediate induction of mild therapeutic hypothermia for all resuscitated victims who remain comatose offers the best hope for neurological recovery. Numerous reports suggest that early coronary angiography and PCI also improve outcome among those resuscitated from cardiac arrest whose postresuscitation ECG show evidence of ST elevation myocardial infarctions. Most promising is combining these two postresuscitation therapies, namely immediate induction of hypothermia and early coronary angiography and PCI. Combining these therapies has resulted in long-term survival rates of 70% with more than 80% of all such survivors neurologically functional. Even those without ST elevation on their postresuscitation ECG can greatly benefit from timely induction of hypothermia and early angiography/PCI.

### Critical care management of patients after cardiac arrest: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association and Neurocritical Care Society [^115TTz4T]. Circulation (2024). Medium credibility.

Five randomized studies evaluating the value of early coronary angiography in those without ST-segment elevation have been published, including 2 in 2019 and 1 in 2020. The first was the limited ARREST pilot study of 40 patients. As anticipated, no outcome differences were found, and the main conclusion was that a larger, definitive RCT to examine this issue was feasible, acceptable, and safe. Of note, 15 of 32 (47%) undergoing coronary angiography within 3 hours of admission had a culprit lesion found and revascularized. The COACT trial (Coronary Angiography After Cardiac Arrest)randomized 552 patients without an ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction to either immediate or delayed coronary angiography. No difference in 90-day survival was seen between the groups. However, acute unstable coronary lesions were found in only 14% of patients undergoing immediate coronary angiography. The DISCO pilot study (Direct or Subacute Coronary Angiography in Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest), a small pilot randomized trial, did not report > 24-hour survival but did find a culprit lesion in 37% of patients undergoing early coronary angiography. The PEARL study (Pilot Randomized Clinical Trial of Early Coronary Angiography Versus No Early Coronary Angiography for Post–Cardiac Arrest Patients Without ST-Segment Elevation), although underpowered to show any outcome differences, found a culprit vessel in 47% of patients undergoing early coronary angiography, including 1 of every 7 patients demonstrating an acutely occluded culprit vessel. The true prevalence of coronary culprit lesions in those without ST-segment elevation is not yet resolved. The effect of early coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention on outcome will probably be directly related to the prevalence of lesions. A fifth RCT, the Angiography After Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest Without ST-Segment Elevation, was published in 2021. Randomizing a total of 530 patients to early or delayed/selective coronary angiography, those investigators found no difference in 30-day mortality. They reported a culprit vessel incidence of 38% in those undergoing immediate coronary angiography but did not provide any data on acutely occluded culprit lesions. Last, the EMERGE trial (Emergency vs Delayed Coronary Angiogram in Survivors of Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest) was published in 2022.EMERGE randomized 279 patients to emergency or delayed coronary angiography (141 and 138 patients, respectively) and again showed no difference in their primary end point of 180-day survival with Cerebral Performance Category of 1 or 2. At least 2 more trials are evaluating the role of emergent coronary angiography patients in this population (NCT02309151 and NCT02641626).

### Early coronary angiography and survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116iPteB]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Most of the included studies only reported unadjusted association between early coronary angiography and survival outcomes, which are likely to be confounded by differences between patients who did and did not undergo early coronary angiography. Among studies that were judged as methodologically rigorous, the association of early coronary angiography with study outcomes was more conservative and less heterogeneous in such studies. Given that early coronary angiography is more likely to be offered to patients who may be more likely to survive (such as patients with intact neurological function at the time of admission), failure to account for confounding due to indication (or treatment selection bias) in study design may have a significant impact on the validity of observational studies.

We also found that between-study heterogeneity was also explained by differences in patient characteristics of included studies. In particular, survival estimates from studies that only included patients with an initial shockable rhythm were less heterogeneous compared with studies that included all rhythms with regard to favourable neurological outcome. It is likely that patients with OHCA due to an initial shockable rhythm such as ventricular fibrillation are more likely to have AMI as the underlying aetiology of arrest, where the benefit of early coronary angiography is better defined compared with studies that included a more heterogeneous population with regard to initial rhythm. Likewise, differences in studies with regard to proportion of patients with STEMI may have modified the association between early coronary angiography and survival and therefore also explained some of the between-study heterogeneity in the pooled estimates. Future studies would need to determine whether the beneficial effect of early coronary angiography depends on the initial rhythm or the underlying aetiology of cardiac arrest.

Revascularization in patients with cardiac arrest or acute coronary syndromes

Coronary Angiography after Cardiac Arrest (COACT) is a landmark study that changed the management of patients admitted with a cardiac arrest who had successful resuscitation and no ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). In this prospective multicentre trial, 552 patients admitted with an out of hospital cardiac arrest with an initial shockable rhythm who did not have an obvious non-cardiac cause of arrest were randomized to immediate coronary angiography and if needed coronary revascularization or delayed coronary angiography after neurological recovery. An acute thrombotic occlusion was noted only in 3.4% of the patients in the immediate angiography and in 7.6% of the patient in the delayed angiography group. Survival rate at discharge (65.2% vs. 68.7%) and at 90-day follow-up (64.5% vs. 67.2%) was not different between randomization groups. In addition, there was no difference for the incidence of the composite endpoint survival with good cerebral performance or mild or moderate disability (62.9% vs. 64.4%). These findings contradict previous observational studies that penalized a delayed invasive assessment of the coronary artery anatomy and justify both approaches in this setting.

Conversely, the Complete vs. Culprit-Only Revascularization Strategies to Treat Multivessel Disease after Early PCI for STEMI (COMPLETE) study confirmed the value of an aggressive revascularization strategy in patients admitted with a STEMI. In this study, 4041 patients who had multivessel CAD were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to complete revascularization vs. culprit-lesion-only PCI. At 3-year follow-up, the incidence of the composite endpoint cardiovascular death or myocardial infarction (MI) was lower in patients undergoing complete revascularization as compared to the patients that had PCI only in the culprit vessel (7.8% vs. 10.5%; P = 0.004); of note, the benefit of complete revascularization was similar in patients who had an in-hospital second procedure compared to a procedure following readmission within 45 days post-discharge; however, this comparison was not randomized, as the choice for timing of the second procedure was left to operator's discretion. The prognostic value of complete revascularization in patients with non-STEMI has not been fully investigated yet.

### Design of DISCO-direct or subacute coronary angiography in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest study [^114eV9rR]. American Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Acute coronary syndrome is a common cause of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). In patients with OHCA presenting with ST elevation, immediate coronary angiography and potential percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) after return of spontaneous circulation are recommended. However, the evidence for this invasive strategy in patients without ST elevation is limited. Observational studies have shown a culprit coronary artery occlusion in about 30% of these patients, indicating the electrocardiogram's (ECG's) limited sensitivity. The aim of this study is to determine whether immediate coronary angiography and subsequent PCI will provide outcome benefits in OHCA patients without ST elevation.

Methods/Design

We describe the design of the DIrect or Subacute Coronary angiography in Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest study (DISCO)-a pragmatic national, multicenter, randomized, clinical study. OHCA patients presenting with no ST elevation on their first recorded ECG will be randomized to a strategy of immediate coronary angiography or to standard of care with admission to intensive care and angiography after 3days at the earliest unless the patient shows signs of acute ischemia or hemodynamic instability. Primary end point is 30-day survival. An estimated 1,006 patients give 80% power (α = .05) to detect a 20% improved 30-day survival rate from 45% to 54%. Secondary outcomes include good neurologic recovery at 30days and 6months, and cognitive function and cardiac function at 6months.

Conclusion

This randomized clinical study will evaluate the effect of immediate coronary angiography after OHCA on 30-day survival in patients without ST elevation on their first recorded ECG.

### Expanding the role of percutaneous coronary intervention in patients resuscitated from cardiac arrest [^117XS4PF]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Special attention to post-cardiac arrest management is important to long-term survival and favorable neurological outcome in patients resuscitated from cardiac arrest. The use of emergent percutaneous coronary intervention in resuscitated patients presenting with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction has long been considered an appropriate approach for coronary revascularization. Recent evidence suggests that other subsets of patients, namely, post-cardiac arrest patients without ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, may benefit from immediate percutaneous coronary intervention following resuscitation. These findings could eventually have important implications for the care of resuscitated patients, including transportation of resuscitated patients to appropriate cardiac interventional facilities, access to treatment modalities such as therapeutic hypothermia, and coordinated care with cardiac catheterization laboratories.

### Association of timing of electrocardiogram acquisition after return of spontaneous circulation with coronary angiography findings in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest [^116Fx6UL]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

The evidence suggests that an urgent coronary angiography is associated with improved survival in the case of STEMI. On the other hand, the need for urgent coronary angiography is controversial in the absence of STEMI because the survival is similar regardless of an invasive or delayed approach.

In light of these results, we believe that the precise diagnosis of STEMI is important for the correct management of patients who are resuscitated from OHCA and for the precise identification of patients for whom an urgent coronary angiography could be beneficial. However, the European Resuscitation Council, American Heart Association, and European Society of Cardiology guidelines, although stressing the key role of the ECG acquisition after ROSC, do not establish the timing for this.

Our study showed that the timing of ECG recording was associated with minimizing the rate of false-positive ECG findings and therefore with correctly identifying patients who should undergo coronary angiography immediately. The percentage of false-positive ECG findings was 3 times greater when the ECG was acquired in the first 7 minutes after ROSC rather than after the eighth minute. The positive predictive value of ECG meeting STEMI criteria for predicting the need for PTCA increased from the first tertile of the ROSC to ECG time to the second and the third tertiles. Moreover, the rate of true-negative ECG findings (ie, findings that did not meet STEMI in patients who did not need PTCA) increased markedly between the first and second tertiles. This result can be reasonably explained considering that the absence of coronary flow during cardiac arrest induces ischemia, leading to an alteration of the ECG findings. If the post-ROSC ECG is performed too early, it could be reasonably affected by the deep ischemia induced by the period of no flow and/or low flow, resulting in a transmural myocardial ischemia that is not necessarily of coronary origin. To our knowledge, none of the studies on the immediate or delayed performance of coronary angiography after ROSC has considered the timing of ECG acquisition, which given the results of the present study, may have influenced the results of those studies.

### Post-resuscitation care following out-of-hospital and in-hospital cardiac arrest [^115wZ6Ut]. Heart (2015). Low credibility.

Cardiac arrest is a leading cause of death in developed countries. Although a majority of cardiac arrest patients die during the acute event, a substantial proportion of cardiac arrest deaths occur in patients following successful resuscitation and can be attributed to the development of post-cardiac arrest syndrome. There is growing recognition that integrated post-resuscitation care, which encompasses targeted temperature management (TTM), early coronary angiography and comprehensive critical care, can improve patient outcomes. TTM has been shown to improve survival and neurological outcome in patients who remain comatose especially following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to ventricular arrhythmias. Early coronary angiography and revascularisation if needed may also be beneficial during the post-resuscitation phase, based on data from observational studies. In addition, resuscitated patients usually require intensive care, which includes mechanical ventilator, haemodynamic support and close monitoring of blood gases, glucose, electrolytes, seizures and other disease-specific intervention. Efforts should be taken to avoid premature withdrawal of life-supporting treatment, especially in patients treated with TTM. Given that resources and personnel needed to provide high-quality post-resuscitation care may not exist at all hospitals, professional societies have recommended regionalisation of post-resuscitation care in specialised 'cardiac arrest centres' as a strategy to improve cardiac arrest outcomes. Finally, evidence for post-resuscitation care following in-hospital cardiac arrest is largely extrapolated from studies in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Future studies need to examine the effectiveness of different post-resuscitation strategies, such as TTM, in patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest.

### Outcomes of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest at centers with and without on-site coronary angiography: a Nationwide analysis [^112fUbuQ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Our findings demonstrate substantial variation in OHCA outcomes across US hospitals, with significantly higher risk‐adjusted mortality at centers without onsite coronary angiography, particularly in rural settings. These results support ongoing efforts to regionalize postarrest care and underscore the potential role of centers with coronary angiography capabilities as specialized resuscitation hubs within regionalized systems. These findings further emphasize the need for national policy initiatives to address geographic disparities, optimize resource distribution, and standardize care delivery. Future research should focus on delineating the role of prehospital factors and implementing regionalization strategies to identify best practices for improving outcomes.

### Invasive management of out of hospital cardiac arrest [^111icH61]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2019). Medium credibility.

Out of hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Clinical decision making is extremely difficult in this understudied patient population with high prevalence of neurological injury and inexorable shock states. As such, there are uncertain benefits from therapies available in the cardiac catheterization laboratory. Fear of futility and public reporting often affects decision making and can result in risk aversion. This review focuses on invasive management in OHCA care, with particular focus on coronary angiography, coronary revascularization, and mechanical support. Guidelines recommend emergency coronary angiography in patients with ST-segment elevations on ECG after OHCA, while the role of coronary angiography in patients without ST-segment elevations is less clear. Similar uncertainty remains in the appropriate revascularization strategy in these patients. As in other areas of cardiology, there is a growing interest in the role of mechanical circulatory support after OHCA, though the available literature shows mixed results. The many uncertainties associated with treating the patient with OHCA highlight the importance of clinical decision support tools and treatment algorithms in the care of this population. This review focuses on invasive management in OHCA care, with particular focus on coronary angiography, coronary revascularization, and mechanical support.

### SCAI expert consensus statement on out of hospital cardiac arrest [^116Rdown]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2020). High credibility.

OHCA patients with shockable rhythm without STEMI on post–return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) ECG — evidence on coronary lesions and angiography timing indicates the prevalence of an acute thrombotic occlusion is ~3.4–30%. A meta-analysis of 23 observational studies found angiography within 24 hr was associated with improved survival (Risk Ratio:1.52, 95% CI: 1.32–1.74, p < .001) and better neurological outcomes (Risk ratio: 1.69, 95% CI: 1.40–2.04, p < .001) versus later or no angiography. In the randomized Coronary Angiography after Cardiac Arrest Trial (COACT), involving 538 patients, there was no survival benefit at 90 days for immediate/early versus delayed angiography; targeted temperature management (TTM) was initiated in more than 90% and 87% received norepinephrine, with neurological etiologies causing death in more than 70% in both groups. In the delayed-angiography group, 14.4% underwent urgent angiography; an unstable lesion was detected in 39.5% versus 13.6% in the immediate group, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed in 22 patients (57.9%) versus 33% in the immediate group, and survival among these patients was not lower than in the total cohort (71.1 and 65.4%, respectively).

### Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: in-hospital intervention strategies [^116p1LYU]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

The prognosis after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) has improved in the past few decades because of advances in interventions used outside and in hospital. About half of patients who have OHCA with initial ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation and who are admitted to hospital in coma after return of spontaneous circulation will survive to discharge with a reasonable neurological status. In this Series paper we discuss in-hospital management of patients with post-cardiac-arrest syndrome. In most patients, the most important in-hospital interventions other than routine intensive care are continuous active treatment (in non-comatose and comatose patients and including circulatory support in selected patients), cooling of core temperature to 32–36°C by targeted temperature management for at least 24 h, immediate coronary angiography with or without percutaneous coronary intervention, and delay of final prognosis until at least 72 h after OHCA. Prognosis should be based on clinical observations and multimodal testing, with focus on no residual sedation.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for cardiac arrest, more specifically with respect to post-resuscitation evaluation, coronary angiography, ACC/ACEP/AHA/NAEMSP/SCAI 2025 guidelines recommend to do not perform immediate angiography in resuscitated patients who are comatose after cardiac arrest, electrically and hemodynamically stable, and without evidence of STEMI.

### Early coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention are associated with improved outcomes after out of hospital cardiac arrest [^117L3AD2]. Resuscitation (2018). Low credibility.

Aim

Early coronary angiography (CAG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) are associated with better outcomes in subjects resuscitated from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). We sought to determine the relative contributions of early CAG and PCI to outcomes and adverse events after OHCA.

Methods

We analyzed 599 OHCA subjects from a prospective two-center registry. Hospital survival, functional outcomes and adverse events were compared between subjects undergoing early CAG (within 24h) with or without PCI and subjects not undergoing early CAG. We adjusted for propensity to perform early CAG and PCI and for post-resuscitation illness severity and care.

Results

Early CAG subjects had improved rates of hospital survival (56.2% versus 31.0%, OR 2.85 [95% CI 2.04–4.00]; p < 0.0001) and better functional outcomes compared to no early CAG. Early PCI was associated with improved survival compared to early CAG without PCI (65.6% versus 45.5%, OR 2.29 [95% CI 1.41–3.69]; p < 0.001). After multivariate adjustment and propensity matching, early PCI remained significantly associated with improved survival compared with early CAG without PCI and no early CAG, but early CAG without PCI was no longer significantly associated with improved outcome compared with no early CAG. Early CAG and early PCI were not associated with an increase in transfusions or acute kidney injury.

Conclusions

Early CAG and PCI are associated with improved survival and functional outcomes after OHCA, but only early PCI was associated with a significant benefit after statistical adjustment. Our analysis supports the performance of immediate CAG to determine the need for PCI in selected patients following resuscitation from OHCA.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis of the effect of routine early angiography in patients with return of spontaneous circulation after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest [^111yzJ8P]. Resuscitation (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Early coronary angiography (CAG) has been reported in individual studies and systematic reviews to significantly improve outcomes of patients with return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) after cardiac arrest (CA).

Methods

We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the impact of early CAG on key clinical outcomes in comatose patients after ROSC following out-of-hospital CA of presumed cardiac origin. We searched the PubMED, EMBASE, CINAHL, ERIC and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases from 1990 until April 2020. Eligible studies compared patients undergoing early CAG to patients with late or no CAG. When randomized controlled trials (RCTs) existed for a specific outcome, we used their results to estimate the effect of the intervention. In the absence of randomized data, we used observational data. We excluded studies at high risk of bias according to the Robins-I tool from the meta-analysis. The GRADE system was used to assess certainty of evidence at an outcome level.

Results

Of 3738 citations screened, 3 randomized trials and 41 observational studies were eligible for inclusion. Evidence certainty across all outcomes for the RCTs was assessed as low. Randomized data showed no benefit from early as opposed to late CAG across all critical outcomes of survival and survival with favourable neurologic outcome for undifferentiated patients and for patient subgroups without ST-segment-elevation on post ROSC ECG and shockable initial rhythm.

Conclusion

These results do not support routine early CAG in undifferentiated comatose patients and patients without STE on post ROSC ECG after OHCA.

### Advanced life support. post-cardiac arrest care [^114ZarQ1]. REDCROSS (2025). High credibility.

Red Cross Guidelines — post-cardiac arrest coronary angiography states that an early or a delayed approach is reasonable for unresponsive patients without ST-elevation when coronary angiography is being considered, and that early coronary angiography should be considered in comatose patients with ST-elevation. An updated ILCOR systematic review of early versus late coronary angiography included a single new RCT and reported that the overall results of the revised meta-analyses are unchanged and the ILCOR treatment recommendations are unchanged, with insufficient evidence to show improved outcomes with early coronary angiography in patients without ST-segment elevation on ECG; early coronary angiography is an accepted standard of care for ST-elevation myocardial infarction without cardiac arrest.

### ILCOR scientific knowledge gaps and clinical research priorities for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and emergency cardiovascular care: a consensus statement [^114iPRvn]. Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Post–cardiac arrest coronary angiography in non–ST-segment elevation — knowledge gaps and active randomized trials are highlighted: There are no published randomized studies on emergency angiography and primary percutaneous coronary intervention after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), and multiple prospective trials are in progress. Specific knowledge gaps include identifying which subgroups of patients with non–ST-segment elevation are most likely to benefit and which may not benefit at all. Ongoing trials include COACT, a prospective randomized study of immediate versus delayed coronary angiography for post-ROSC patients with non–ST-segment elevation with a primary outcome of 90-day survival; PEARL, a US multicenter study assessing the safety and efficacy of early (< 120 minutes) angiography in adults without ST-segment elevation on ECG after ROSC; and TOMAHAWK, which will address the timing of angiography with a primary outcome of 30-day survival. Additional studies include DISCO comparing the safety and efficacy of these 2 approaches, ARREST exploring transfer to a cardiac arrest center and immediate percutaneous coronary intervention in patients without ST-segment elevation on postresuscitation ECG, and ACCESS comparing early cardiac catheterization with activation only after ICU admission and consideration by the cardiology and treatment teams. These studies will help to determine whether emergency angiography should be performed in all comatose patients after ROSC or whether there should be clearer criteria for selection.

### Optimal treatment of patients surviving out-of-hospital cardiac arrest [^112KsH4E]. JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions (2012). Low credibility.

Interest in post-resuscitation care has risen with the development of treatment modalities that can affect long-term survival rates even when begun after the systematic ischemia/reperfusion insult associated with cardiac arrest. Mild therapeutic hypothermia has become the foundation for improvement of neurologically favorable survival after cardiac arrest. Reperfusion therapy, specifically early percutaneous coronary intervention, is becoming an important adjunct to therapeutic hypothermia. Identifying which post-cardiac arrest patient had an occluded or unstable coronary vessel is difficult because such events are not reliably predicted by precedent symptoms or standard electrocardiographic analysis. Increasing clinical experience suggests that resuscitated cardiac arrest victims without an obvious noncardiac etiology should undergo emergency coronary angiography and, where indicated, percutaneous coronary intervention. If comatose, they should receive concurrent therapeutic hypothermia. Such an approach can double long-term survival rates among those successfully resuscitated after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for cardiac arrest, more specifically with respect to post-resuscitation evaluation, coronary angiography, ESC 2018 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining urgent angiography (and performing PCI if indicated) in patients with resuscitated cardiac arrest without diagnostic ST-elevation but with a high suspicion of ongoing myocardial ischemia.

### Cost analysis from a randomized comparison of immediate versus delayed angiography after cardiac arrest [^116ceYcD]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

During the initial hospital admittance, no significant difference in total health care costs is observed between the immediate and delayed coronary angiography strategy group in patients successfully resuscitated after OHCA with an initial shockable rhythm, but without ST‐segment elevation. With respect to the higher invasive procedure costs in the immediate group, a strategy awaiting neurological recovery followed by coronary angiography and planned revascularization may be considered.

### Cardiac arrest: a treatment algorithm for emergent invasive cardiac procedures in the resuscitated comatose patient [^112b3GVY]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Patients who are comatose after cardiac arrest continue to be a challenge, with high mortality. Although there is an American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association Class I recommendation for performing immediate angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention (when indicated) in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, no guidelines exist for patients without ST-segment elevation. Early introduction of mild therapeutic hypothermia is an established treatment goal. However, there are no established guidelines for risk stratification of patients for cardiac catheterization and possible percutaneous coronary intervention, particularly in patients who have unfavorable clinical features in whom procedures may be futile and affect public reporting of mortality. An algorithm is presented to improve the risk stratification of these severely ill patients with an emphasis on consultation and evaluation of patients prior to activation of the cardiac catheterization laboratory.

### Association between the timing of coronary angiography, targeted temperature management, and neurological outcomes after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: a Nationwide population-based registry study in Korea [^112rBCxs]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Coronary artery disease is the most common cause of patients with out‐of‐hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) who are admitted to the intensive care unit, and hypoxic–ischemic brain injury is a major cause of mortality in these patients. Therefore, early interventions, such as coronary angiography (CAG) and subsequent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) if indicated, in conjunction with targeted temperature management (TTM), may have the potential to improve cardiac and cerebral function in these patients. However, the outcomes of patients with OHCA are still unsatisfactory.

The prevalence of clinically significant coronary artery lesions among resuscitated patients with OHCA is notably high and ranges from 60% to 80%, making it a potentially treatable underlying cause of OHCA. Consequently, current international resuscitation guidelines recommend immediate CAG for resuscitation patients if there is clinical or ECG evidence of myocardial ischemia. However, although the ECG criteria for ST‐segment elevation (STE) exhibit high specificity for identifying significant coronary lesions necessitating PCI, their sensitivity is relatively low. On the other hand, for patients who do not meet the ECG criteria for STE, there is limited evidence to guide decision‐making on the urgency of CAG. Recently, several randomized clinical trials have indicated that early CAG is not associated with improved outcomes for postresuscitation patients without STE. The investigators explained that these results were due to the low PCI rates and that most deaths are attributed to hypoxic–ischemic brain injury. Although immediate CAG is recommended in patients with suspected significant coronary lesions, successfully resuscitated patients should be prioritized for hemodynamic and respiratory optimization, and concomitant TTM should be prioritized in unresponsive patients. Performing immediate CAG may unnecessarily delay TTM, and a crucial clinical issue to address is the interaction between the timing of CAG and TTM. However, most previous studies have focused primarily on early CAG without considering its potential hindrance to early TTM. Furthermore, logically, successful PCI, rather than CAG, may be associated with neurological outcomes.

In this study, we examined the timing of CAG and TTM initiation in patients who underwent both interventions within 24 hours after OHCA using the Korean nationwide OHCA registry. Our objective was to evaluate the associations between the timing of these interventions or performing CAG before TTM and neurological outcomes. A secondary aim was to investigate whether these associations vary on the basis of whether they underwent PCI, irrespective of postresuscitation ECG findings.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Acute coronary syndromes — management of patients presenting with cardiac arrest includes the following directives: Patients with cardiac arrest and ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) who have been resuscitated should preferentially be transferred by emergency medical services (EMS) to a PCI-capable center; patients who have been resuscitated after cardiac arrest and are noncomatose or who are comatose with favorable prognostic features and with evidence of STEMI should undergo PPCI to improve survival; in patients with cardiac arrest who are comatose, have unfavorable prognostic features, and evidence of STEMI, PPCI may be reasonable after individualized assessment; and in resuscitated patients who are comatose after cardiac arrest, electrically and hemodynamically stable, and without evidence of STEMI, immediate angiography is not recommended due to lack of benefit.

### Distance to invasive heart centre, performance of acute coronary angiography, and angioplasty and associated outcome in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: a nationwide study [^117Fdyu1]. European Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Immediate admission to an invasive heart centre and acute CAG/PCI are associated with improved survival in patients with OHCA, whereas distance from site of the event to the invasive heart centre was not. Our results support the establishment of few high-volume invasive heart centres and suggest that OHCA patients should field-triage directly to these centres for optimal post-resuscitation care, regardless of the distance. Clinical randomized studies are needed to clarify the causality between acute CAG/PCI and survival.

### Coronary angiography findings in resuscitated and refractory out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112avLD8]. Resuscitation (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Coronary angiography (CAG) frequently reveals coronary artery disease (CAD) after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), but its use is not standardized and often reported in different subpopulations. This systematic review and meta-analysis accurately describes angiographic features in resuscitated and refractory OHCA.

Methods

PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched up to October 31, 2022. Studies reporting coronary angiography findings after OHCA were considered eligible. The primary outcome was location and rate of coronary lesions. Coronary angiography findings with 95% confidence intervals were pooled with a meta-analysis of proportion.

Results

128 studies (62,845 patients) were included. CAG, performed in 69% (63–75%) of patients, found a significant CAD in 75% (70–79%), a culprit lesion in 63% (59–66%), and a multivessel disease in 46% (41–51%). Compared to patients with return of spontaneous circulation, refractory OHCA was associated with more severe CAD due to a higher rate of left main involvement (17% [12–24%] vs 5.7% [3.1–10%]; p = 0.002) and acute occlusion of left anterior descending artery (27% [17–39%] vs 15% [13–18%]; p = 0.02). Nonshockable patients without ST-elevation were those receiving CAG less frequently, despite significant disease in 54% (31–76%). Left anterior descending artery was the most frequently involved (34% [30–39%]).

Conclusions

Patients with OHCA have a high prevalence of significant CAD caused by acute and treatable coronary lesions. Refractory OHCA was associated with more severe coronary lesions. CAD was also present in patients with nonshockable rhythm and without ST elevation. However, heterogeneity of studies and selection of patients undergoing CAG limit the certainty of findings.

### Association of timing of electrocardiogram acquisition after return of spontaneous circulation with coronary angiography findings in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest [^111xq82y]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, with an estimated annual incidence of OHCAs treated by emergency medical services (EMS) ranging from 30.0 to 97.1 individuals per 100 000 inhabitants. The cornerstone in the treatment of cardiac arrest is represented by the chain of survival. The chain of survival is the linkage of the actions to be implemented, from the community response to in-hospital treatment, to improve the chance of achieving the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and consequently the chances of survival. Starting in 2010, the European Resuscitation Council and the American Heart Association have focused on post-ROSC treatment by adding specific chapters to their resuscitation guidelines, and the American Heart Association added a fifth link to the classic chain of survival. A series of diagnostic and therapeutic actions must be implemented in the post-ROSC phase both to stabilize the patient and to discover and treat the underlying disease that led to the cardiac arrest. In this context, electrocardiography (ECG) represents the first and easiest diagnostic tool, and it should be acquired immediately after achievement of ROSC to identify the need for an urgent coronary angiography, which is indicated only in the case of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). However, neither the American nor the European resuscitation guidelines provide specific instructions about the best time for ECG acquisition after ROSC; they only recommend the recording of a 12-lead ECG as soon as possible after ROSC.

Despite the absence of data in the literature, it is reasonable to assume that, in the early post-ROSC phase, the ECG could reflect the ischemia secondary to cardiac arrest more than or in addition to ischemia due to coronary artery pathology, possibly leading to overdiagnosis of STEMI (false-positive ECG findings). This possibility represents a important topic because, in many cases, the choice made to transfer patients to a hospital that offers percutaneous coronary intervention–mediated reperfusion therapy 24 hours per day for 7 days per week (hub center) or to a hospital with no percutaneous coronary intervention (spoke center) depends on the diagnosis of STEMI. Furthermore, coronary angiography requires the administration of drugs (ie, heparin sodium) that could be potentially harmful in other medical causes of OHCA (eg, brain hemorrhage and aortic dissection).

### Association of timing of electrocardiogram acquisition after return of spontaneous circulation with coronary angiography findings in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest [^1149ny4P]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this cohort study, the early acquisition of the post-ROSC ECG in patients who were resuscitated from an OHCA was associated with a higher rate of patients with post-ROSC ECG findings that met STEMI criteria but who did not have obstructive coronary artery disease worthy of PTCA on angiography. Therefore, delaying the post-ROSC ECG by at least 8 minutes after ROSC or repeating the acquisition if the first ECG was diagnostic of STEMI and was acquired early after ROSC may be reasonable to correctly identify patients who may benefit from an immediate rather than a delayed coronary angiography.

### Effectiveness of emergency versus nonemergent coronary angiography after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest without ST-segment elevation: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114EMpqU]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

The optimal timing of coronary angiography (CAG) in patients after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) without ST-segment elevation remains controversial. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis of randomized control trials to investigate the effectiveness of emergency CAG versus delayed CAG in OHCA patients with a non-ST-segment elevated rhythm. PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, Cochrane CENTRAL, and JBI databases were searched from inception to September 7, 2022. Our primary end point was survival with a good neurological outcome, whereas the secondary outcomes included short-term survival, mid-term survival, recurrent arrhythmias, myocardial infarction after hospitalization, major bleeding, acute kidney injury, and left ventricular ejection fraction. Nine randomized control trials involving 2,569 patients were included in this analysis. Our meta-analysis showed no significant difference in the improvement of neurological outcome (RR 0.96, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] [0.87, 1.06]), short-term survival (risk ratio [RR] 0.98, 95% CI [0.89, 1.08]), mid-term survival (RR 0.98, 95% CI [0.87, 1.10]), recurrent arrhythmias (RR 1.02, 95% CI [0.50, 2.06]), myocardial infarction (RR 0.66, 95% CI [0.13, 3.30]), major bleeding (RR 0.96, 95% CI [0.55, 1.69]), acute kidney injury (RR 1.20, 95% CI [0.32, 4.49]) and left ventricular ejection fraction (RR 0.89, 95% CI [0.69, 1.15]) in patients who underwent emergency CAG compared with delayed CAG patients. In conclusion, our analysis revealed that emergency CAG had no prognostic superiority over delayed CAG in patients with OHCA without ST-segment elevation.

### Cardiac catheterization is associated with superior outcomes for survivors of out of hospital cardiac arrest: review and meta-analysis [^111K5vNb]. Resuscitation (2014). Low credibility.

Aims

Survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) have a high rate of morbidity and mortality. Invasive cardiac assessment with coronary angiography offers the potential for improving outcomes by facilitating early revascularization. The aim of the present study was to review the published data on early coronary angiography for survivors of OHCA, and its impact on survival and neurological outcomes.

Methods

Medline, Embase and PubMed were searched with a structured search query. The primary outcome was in-hospital (or if not available, 30 day or 6 month) survival. Rates of survival with good neurological outcome were a secondary endpoint. The time period of the search was from 1 January 1980 to 1 January 2014. Data was pooled with means and 95% CI interval calculated. Meta-analysis of the main outcomes was performed using a weighted random effects model.

Results

Following review of all identified records, 105 relevant full text articles were retrieved. Fifty had adequate outcome information stratified by the use of coronary angiography for analysis. In studies where a control group was available for comparison, the overall survival in the acute angiography group was 58.8% versus 30.9% in the control group (Odds ratio 2.77, 95% CI 2.06–3.72). Survival with good neurological outcome (as per the Utstein framework) in the early angiography group was 58% versus 35.8% in the control group (Odds ratio 2.20, 95% CI 1.46–3.32).

Conclusions

Early coronary angiography in patients following OHCA is associated with improved outcome and better survival.

### The evolving role of the cardiac catheterization laboratory in the management of patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^112msjCm]. Circulation (2019). Medium credibility.

Coronary artery disease is prevalent in different causes of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), especially in individuals presenting with shockable rhythms of ventricular fibrillation/pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VF/pVT). The purpose of this report is to review the known prevalence and potential importance of coronary artery disease in patients with OHCA and to describe the emerging paradigm of treatment with advanced perfusion/reperfusion techniques and their potential benefits on the basis of available evidence. Although randomized clinical trials are planned or ongoing, current scientific evidence rests principally on observational case series with their potential confounding selection bias. Among patients resuscitated from VF/pVT OHCA with ST-segment elevation on their postresuscitation ECG, the prevalence of coronary artery disease has been shown to be 70% to 85%. More than 90% of these patients have had successful percutaneous coronary intervention. Conversely, among patients resuscitated from VF/pVT OHCA without ST-segment elevation on their postresuscitation ECG, the prevalence of coronary artery disease has been shown to be 25% to 50%. For these patients, early access to the cardiac catheterization laboratory is associated with a 10% to 15% absolute higher functionally favorable survival rate compared with more conservative approaches of late or no access to the cardiac catheterization laboratory. In patients with VF/pVT OHCA refractory to standard treatment, a new treatment paradigm is also emerging that uses venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation to facilitate return of normal perfusion and to support further resuscitation efforts, including coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention. The burden of coronary artery disease is high in this patient population, presumably causative in most patients. The strategy of venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, coronary angiography, and percutaneous coronary intervention has resulted in functionally favorable survival rates ranging from 9% to 45% in observational studies in this patient population. Patients with VF/pVT should be considered at the highest severity in the continuum of acute coronary syndromes. These patients have a significant burden of coronary artery disease and acute coronary thrombotic events. Evidence from randomized trials will further define optimal clinical practice.

### Variation in coronary angiography use in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest [^113Mj6hE]. Resuscitation (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Multiple studies have examined the association of early coronary angiography (CAG) among out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients with conflicting results. However, patterns of use of CAG among OHCA patients in real-world settings are not well-described.

Methods

Utilizing data from the Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium's Continuous Chest Compressions trial for our analysis, we stratified patients based on initial arrest rhythm and ST-elevation on initial post-resuscitation electrocardiogram (ECG) and examined the rates of CAG in resuscitated patients. We also examined the rates of CAG across different trial clusters in the overall study population as well as in pre-specified patient subgroups RESULTS: Of 26,148 patients in the CCC trial, 5,608 survived to hospital admission and were enrolled in the study. Among them, 26% underwent CAG. Patients with ST-elevation underwent CAG at a significantly higher rate than patients presenting without ST-elevation (70% vs 31%, p < 0.001). Similarly, patients presenting with shockable rhythms underwent CAG more frequently compared with patients with non-shockable rhythms (28% vs 5%, p < 0.001). There was marked variation in CAG frequency across different trial clusters with the proportion of patients within a trial cluster receiving CAG ranging from 4% - 41%. The proportion varied more among patients with ST-elevation (16% - 82%) or initial shockable rhythm (11% - 75%) compared with no ST-elevation (2% - 28%) or initial non-shockable rhythm (0% - 19%).

Conclusion

Among a national cohort of OHCA patients, large variation in the use of CAG exists, highlighting the existing uncertainty regarding perceived benefit from early CAG in OHCA.

### Impact of routine percutaneous coronary intervention after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation [^111xWqqz]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

In keeping with previous studies, we have shown that PCI is strongly and independently associated with survival in patients with stable hemodynamics. In addition, routine coronary angiography allowed us to diagnose previously unknown significant coronary heart disease in 49% of our patients, especially those < 65 years old (groups 1, 2 and 3), regardless of the presence of ST elevation. Dumas et al. recently reported similar results in a large series of patients with OHCA related to shock-sensitive (68%) and unshockable (32%) rhythms. In patients with no obvious extracardiac etiology and no ST elevation visualized on ECGs, routine coronary angiography disclosed coronary heart disease in 58% of patients and PCI was performed in 26% of them. Successful PCI also appeared to be protective in this series. Similarly, Lellouche et al. reported, in a large series of patients resuscitated after cardiac arrest who systematically underwent a coronary angiography, that myocardial infarction was the leading cause (54%) and that the sensitivity and specificity of ST elevation to detect the presence of an underlying acute coronary lesion were 50% and 88%, respectively. Taken together, these data strongly support the performance of a routine coronary angiography in the clinical setting of resuscitated patients who are treated with MTH after OHCA secondary to VF. Nevertheless, discrepant results have previously been reported in similar clinical settings. In a series of 186 patients who underwent immediate PCI after successful resuscitation for cardiac arrest complicating acute myocardial infarction, Garot et al. showed that PCI was not associated with survival. Similarly, Anyfantakis et al. reported that the use of PCI was not an independent correlate of survival in 72 patients who underwent immediate coronary angiography after being resuscitated from cardiac arrest. Importantly, coronary angiography was systematically performed in these studies, whereas this procedure was carried out only in patients with stable hemodynamics in the current series. In addition, the need for epinephrine infusion during coronary angiography was strongly associated with death in the previous work reported by Anyfantakis et al.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for cardiac arrest, more specifically with respect to post-resuscitation evaluation, coronary angiography, AHA 2025 guidelines recommend to do not perform emergency coronary angiography over a delayed or selective strategy in adult comatose patients with ROSC after cardiac arrest in the absence of ST-segment elevation, shock, electrical instability, or evidence of significant ongoing myocardial ischemia.

### Comparison of role of early (less than six hours) to later (more than six hours) or no cardiac catheterization after resuscitation from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest [^113ScEnT]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Despite reports of patients with resuscitated sudden cardiac arrest (rSCA) receiving acute cardiac catheterization, the efficacy of this strategy is largely unknown. We hypothesized that acute cardiac catheterization of patients with rSCA would improve survival to hospital discharge. A retrospective cohort of 240 patients with out-of-hospital rSCA caused by ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation was identified from 11 institutions in Seattle, Washington from 1999 through 2002. Patients were grouped into those receiving acute catheterization within 6 hours (≤ 6-hour group, n = 61) and those with deferred catheterization at > 6 hours or no catheterization during the index hospitalization (> 6-hour group, n = 179). Attention was directed to survival to hospital discharge, neurologic status, extent of coronary artery disease, presenting electrocardiographic findings, and symptoms before arrest. Propensity-score methods were used to adjust for the likelihood of receiving acute catheterization. Survival was greater in patients who underwent acute catheterization (72% in the ≤ 6-hour group vs 49% in the > 6-hour group, p = 0.001). Percutaneous coronary intervention was performed in 38 of 61 patients (62%) in the ≤ 6-hour group and 13 of 170 patients (7%) in the > 6-hour group (p < 0.0001). Neurologic status was similar in the 2 groups. A significantly larger percentage of patients in the acute catheterization group had symptoms before cardiac arrest and had ST-segment elevation on electrocardiogram after resuscitation. Age, bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation, daytime presentation, history of percutaneous coronary intervention or stroke, and acute ST-segment elevation were positively associated with receiving cardiac catheterization. In conclusion, in this series of patients who sustained out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, acute catheterization (< 6 hours of presentation) was associated with improved survival.

### Impact of emergency coronary angiography on in-hospital outcome of unconscious survivors after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest [^115QbN4X]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Acute coronary thrombotic occlusion is the most common trigger of cardiac arrest. The aim of the present study was to assess the impact of an invasive strategy characterized by emergency coronary angiography and subsequent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), if indicated, on in-hospital survival of resuscitated patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) and no obvious extracardiac cause who do not regain consciousness soon after recovery of spontaneous circulation. Ninety-three consecutive patients (67 ± 12 years old, 76% men) were included in the study. Clinical characteristics and coronary angiographic and in-hospital outcome data were retrospectively collected. Multivariate Cox proportional-hazards analysis was performed to identify independent determinants of in-hospital survival. Coronary angiography was performed in 66 patients (71%). Forty-eight patients underwent emergency coronary angiography; in the remaining 18 patients, mean time from OHCA to coronary angiography was 13 ± 10 days. In patients referred to emergency coronary angiography, successful emergency PCI of a culprit coronary lesion was performed in 25 patients (52%). In-hospital survival rate was 54%. At multivariate analysis, emergency coronary angiography (hazard ratio 2.32, 95% confidence interval 1.23 to 4.38, p = 0.009) and successful emergency PCI (hazard ratio 2.54, 95% confidence interval 1.35 to 4.8, p = 0.004) were independently related to in-hospital survival in the overall study population; delay in performing coronary angiography (hazard ratio 0.95, 95% confidence interval 0.92 to 0.99, p = 0.013) was independently related to in-hospital mortality in patients referred to coronary angiography. In conclusion, an invasive strategy characterized by emergency coronary angiography and subsequent PCI, if indicated, seems to improve in-hospital outcome of resuscitated but unconscious patients with OHCA without obvious extracardiac cause.

### Association of timing of electrocardiogram acquisition after return of spontaneous circulation with coronary angiography findings in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest [^115QWMCM]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Electrocardiography (ECG) is an important tool to triage patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). An immediate coronary angiography after ROSC is recommended only in patients with an ECG that is diagnostic of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). To date, the benefit of this approach has not been demonstrated in patients with a post-ROSC ECG that is not diagnostic of STEMI.

Objective

To assess whether the time from ROSC to ECG acquisition is associated with the diagnostic accuracy of ECG for STEMI.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This retrospective, multicenter cohort study (the Post-ROSC Electrocardiogram After Cardiac Arrest study) analyzed consecutive patients older than 18 years who were resuscitated from OHCA between January 1, 2015, and December 31, 2018, and were admitted to 1 of the 3 participating centers in Europe (Pavia, Italy; Lugano, Switzerland; and Vienna, Austria).

Exposure

Only patients who underwent coronary angiography during hospitalization and who acquired a post-ROSC ECG before the angiography were enrolled. Patients with a nonmedical cause of OHCAs were excluded.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end point was false-positive ECG findings, defined as the percentage of patients with post-ROSC ECG findings that met STEMI criteria but who did not show obstructive coronary artery disease on angiography that was worthy of percutaneous coronary angioplasty.

Results

Of 586 consecutive patients who were admitted to the 3 participating centers, 370 were included in the analysis (287 men [77.6%]; median age, 62 years [interquartile range, 53–70 years]); 121 (32.7%) were enrolled in the participating center in Pavia, Italy; 38 (10.3%) in Lugano, Switzerland; and 211 (57.0%) in Vienna, Austria. The percentage of false-positive ECG findings in the first tertile of ROSC to ECG time (≤ 7 minutes) was significantly higher than that in the second (8–33 minutes) and third (> 33 minutes) tertiles: 18.5% in the first tertile vs 7.2% in the second (odds ratio [OR], 0.34; 95% CI, 0.13–0.87; p = 0.02) and 5.8% in the third (OR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.15–0.47; P < .001). These differences remained significant when adjusting for sex (≤ 7 minutes: reference; 8–33 minutes: OR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.12–0.85; p = 0.02; > 33 minutes: OR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.14–0.47; P < .001), age (≤ 7 minutes: reference; 8–33 minutes: OR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.13–0.89; p = 0.03; > 33 minutes: OR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.15–0.46; P < .001), number of segments with ST-elevation (≤ 7 minutes: reference; 8–33 minutes: OR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.15–0.81; p = 0.01; > 33 minutes: OR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.15–0.52; P < .001), QRS duration (≤ 7 minutes: reference; 8–33 minutes: OR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.14–0.87; p = 0.02; > 33 minutes: OR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.15–0.48; P < .001), heart rate (≤ 7 minutes: reference; 8–33 minutes: OR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.13–0.93; p = 0.04; > 33 minutes: OR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.15–0.55; P < .001), epinephrine administered (≤ 7 minutes: reference; 8–33 minutes: OR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.13–0.98; p = 0.045; > 33 minutes: OR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.16–0.48; P < .001), shockable initial rhythm (≤ 7 minutes: reference; 8–33 minutes: OR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.13–0.96; p = 0.04; > 33 minutes: OR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.15–0.46; P < .001), and 3 or more shocks administered (≤ 7 minutes: reference; 8–33 minutes: OR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.13–1.00; p = 0.05; > 33 minutes: OR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.16–0.48; P < .001) in bivariable analyses.

Conclusions and Relevance

This study suggests that early ECG acquisition after ROSC in patients with OHCA is associated with a higher percentage of false-positive ECG findings for STEMI. It may be reasonable to delay post-ROSC ECG by at least 8 minutes after ROSC or repeat the acquisition if the first ECG is diagnostic of STEMI and is acquired early after ROSC.

### Evaluation of factors associated with selection for coronary angiography and in-hospital mortality among patients presenting with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest without ST-segment elevation [^114dz18H]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2022). Medium credibility.

6 CONCLUSION

Among patients with OHCA, shockable rhythm and no STE, younger age, shorter time to ROSC and GCS > 8 were associated with selection for CA while less effective resuscitation, greater burden of comorbidities and the absence of a treatable coronary lesion were key adverse prognostic predictors. A strategy of early CA was not better than a strategy of delaying CA with respect to survival until hospital discharge. Future work should focus on optimizing early resuscitation efforts and postarrest care to improve survival in this cohort of critically ill patients.

### Mortality in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest undergoing a standardized protocol including therapeutic hypothermia and routine Coronary angiography: experience from the HACORE registry [^111idTkY]. JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study sought to analyze the impact of mandatory therapeutic hypothermia and cardiac catheterization in the absence of overt noncardiac cause of arrest as part of the Hannover Cardiac Resuscitation Algorithm before intensive care admission.

Background

Despite advanced therapies, out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is still associated with high mortality rates. Recently, the TTM (Target Temperature Management 33°C Versus 36°C After Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest)-trial caused severe uncertainty about the efficacy of and need for therapeutic hypothermia. Furthermore, the role of early coronary angiography in OHCA survivors without ST-segment elevation remains undetermined.

Methods

In the HACORE (HAnnover Cooling REgistry) we investigated 233 consecutive patients (median age 64 [interquartile range: 53 to 74] years) with OHCA admitted to our institution between January 2011 and December 2015 who were treated according to the algorithm.

Results

A total of 73% had ventricular fibrillation as primary rhythm. Return of spontaneous circulation was achieved after 20 (interquartile range: 10 to 30) min. Immediate percutaneous coronary angiography was performed in 96% and coronary angioplasty in 59% of all cases. ST-segment elevation was present in 47%. Critical coronary stenosis requiring percutaneous coronary intervention was present in 67% of patients with and 52% of patients without ST-segment elevation. Overall 30-day intrahospital mortality in this real-world registry was 37%. Patients in our local registry who matched the inclusion/exclusion criteria of the TTM-trial (n = 145) had a markedly lower 30-day mortality (27%) compared with the published trial (44%).

Conclusions

Standardized treatment of patients with OHCA following a strict protocol incorporating computed tomography, cardiac catheterization and revascularization, liberal use of active hemodynamic support in presence of shock, and mandatory therapeutic hypothermia results in mortality rates lower than previously reported.

### Impact of routine percutaneous coronary intervention after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation [^112HN8rZ]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Conclusions

We suggest that routine coronary angiography with potentially associated PCI may alter the prognosis of OHCA related to VF in resuscitated patients with stable hemodynamics who are treated with MTH. Whether this strategy is clinically relevant in patients ≥ 75 years old remains to be determined by further studies.

### Age and benefit of early coronary angiography after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in patients presenting with shockable rhythm: insights from the sudden death expertise center registry [^1124Ratc]. Resuscitation (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Little is known about the association between provision of post-resuscitation care and prognosis of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) in elderly patients. Previous studies have suggested futility after 65 years of age.

Objectives

We aimed to evaluate the association of early coronary angiogram (CAG) followed if necessary by percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), with favorable outcome after OHCA among elderly patients, compared to younger patients.

Methods

Using a large French registry, we included all OHCA patients with an initial shockable rhythm, transported to hospital from 2011 to 2015. Favorable outcome was defined as hospital discharge with Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) 1 or 2. and were evaluated by multivariate logistic regression. Subgroup analyses were performed according to age groups: < 65, 65–75 and > 75 years.

Results

Among 1502 included patients, 31% were older than 65 and 12% older than 75 years. An early CAG was performed in 79%, 88% and 76% of patients below 65, between 65 and 75 and above 75, respectively (P = 0.002). The rate of patients discharged with CPC1 or 2 was 42% below 65, 38% between 65 and 75 and 24% above 75 (P < 0.001). Among the whole population, early CAG (OR = 6.4, 95% CI = 3.9–10.5, P < 0.001) was associated with favorable outcome. In subgroups analysis, CAG was associated with favorable outcome among patients < 65 and 65–75. In patients > 75, there was a trend towards a favorable outcome (OR2.9, 95CI = 0.9–9.1).

Conclusions

In a large registry of OHCA survivors, the early CAG use was associated with a better prognosis. This benefit was persistent up to 75 years of age, suggesting that age alone should not guide the decision for early invasive strategy.

### Postresuscitation care with mild therapeutic hypothermia and coronary intervention after out-of-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation: a prospective registry analysis [^1144sjcv]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Our data may therefore support the hypothesis that a standardized postresuscitation care bundle, potentially including a liberal decision for coronary intervention, should be offered to most OHCA patients with successful resuscitation and hospital admission. In addition, it should be noted that a typical history of coronary artery disease or ECG changes typical for ST-elevation myocardial infarction may be absent in up to 57% of OHCA patients, where coronary angiography revealed pathological findings with therapeutic options. Further, clinical symptoms such as chest pain or risk factors often are lacking in the setting of OHCA. Comparable with severe trauma patients, therefore, prompt transfer after successful resuscitation to specialized hospitals/cardiac arrest centers may allow patients to benefit from this invasive therapeutic option. This hypothesis is further supported by the findings of Dumas and colleagues, who recently demonstrated in a multivariable analysis of 435 prospectively registered patients that successful immediate coronary angioplasty was independently associated with improved hospital survival in patients with or without ST-segment elevation. The high incidence of coronary lesions in the Parisian Region Out of Hospital Cardiac Arrest cohort study confirmed previous findings that link acute coronary syndrome and OHCA. Coronary plaque rupture or erosion, fragmentation, and embolization of thrombus were identified as factors able to trigger cardiac arrest. Similar rates have been noted in studies based on postmortem examination of patients with OHCA or angiographic data.

### Association of timing of electrocardiogram acquisition after return of spontaneous circulation with coronary angiography findings in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest [^1114SHxu]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this study was the first to investigate whether the timing of acquisition of post-ROSC ECG after OHCA was associated with the percentage of patients with post-ROSC ECG findings that met STEMI criteria but without obstructive coronary artery disease that was worthy of PTCA on angiography (false-positive ECG findings). The rate of false-positive ECG findings was significantly higher in the early phase after ROSC than in the later phase. This finding supports our hypothesis that, in the early post-ROSC phase, ECG findings could reflect not only the ischemia due to a coronary obstruction but also ischemia due to no blood flow and/or low blood flow during cardiac arrest.

Previous studies have suggested that a coronary lesion that is worthy of percutaneous revascularization is present in 40% to 60% of the patients resuscitated from an OHCA in whom the post-ROSC ECG did not show electrocardiographic signs of STEMI. Our findings support these data because 57.0% of the patients with a post-ROSC ECG that was not diagnostic of STEMI were treated with PTCA.

Although the literature provides evidence of a benefit of an immediate coronary angiography for patients with a post-ROSC ECG that is diagnostic of STEMI, a benefit of an immediate invasive approach has not yet been proven for patients with a post-ROSC ECG that is not diagnostic of STEMI except in the case of electrical or hemodynamic instability.

Previous retrospective studies suggested a benefit of immediate coronary angiography in patients with a post-ROSC ECG that is not diagnostic of STEMI. However, a recent randomized clinical trial reported that survival was similar when comparing an invasive with a delayed approach. This result could be explained by the balancing between a positive effect for those patients with a significant coronary stenosis even if they presented an ECG that was not diagnostic of STEMI and a potentially harmful effect for patients with a post-ROSC ECG that was not diagnostic of STEMI who were resuscitated from a cardiac arrest not attributable to cardiac ischemia, as in the case of brain hemorrhage or aortic dissection.

### Cost analysis from a randomized comparison of immediate versus delayed angiography after cardiac arrest [^117A4QZD]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

The outcome of patients with out‐of‐hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) remains poor, with survival to hospital discharge ranging between 10% and 30%. Even after the return of spontaneous circulation has been achieved, mortality is still around 40%. The leading cause of in‐hospital mortality is poor neurologic outcome, which cannot be predicted in the early phase after cardiac arrest.

While international guidelines recommend emergency coronary angiography (CAG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in selected patients after OHCA, the right timing of intervention is still under debate. However, emergency angiography in patients without a coronary or ischemic cause of the OHCA can further delay evidence‐based interventions on survival such as targeted temperature management and hemodynamic support. The COACT (Coronary Angiography After Cardiac Arrest) trial (Netherlands Trial Register number NL4857) was designed to address this issue. In this investigator‐initiated, randomized, open‐label, multicenter trial, a strategy of immediate CAG was compared with a strategy of delayed angiography in patients who had been successfully resuscitated after cardiac arrest and did not have ST‐segment elevation on ECG. With respect to 90‐day survival no significant difference was seen between the 2 groups. Also, no improvement in 1‐year clinical outcome was observed. A recent meta‐analysis of 3581 patients (11 studies) also found no significant difference in 30‐day mortality, neurological outcome, and PCI rate between early versus nonearly CAG in OHCA without ST‐segment elevation.

In case of equivalence with regard to health outcomes, it is important to assess the costs related to either strategy. Significant differences in costs between the 2 modalities can provide information for policymaking and help in final decision making about the implementation of either an immediate or delayed angiography strategy in patients after OHCA without ST‐segment elevation. Total costs related to managing patients with OHCA are mainly driven by in‐hospital costs and length of stay at the intensive care unit (ICU) during the initial hospitalization. We performed a prespecified cost‐consequence analysis based on the hospital stay and collected RAND‐36 quality‐of‐life scores at 12 months.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for cardiac arrest, more specifically with respect to post-resuscitation evaluation, coronary angiography, AHA 2025 guidelines recommend to perform coronary angiography prior to hospital discharge in adult cardiac arrest survivors with suspected cardiac etiology, particularly in the presence of an initial shockable rhythm, unexplained LV systolic dysfunction, or evidence of severe myocardial ischemia.

### Benefit of an early and systematic imaging procedure after cardiac arrest: insights from the PROCAT (parisian region out of hospital cardiac arrest) registry [^1156Uwht]. Resuscitation (2012). Low credibility.

Aims

Identification of the cause of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is of paramount importance. We investigated the ability of our imaging strategy to provide an early etiological diagnosis of OHCA and the influence of this strategy on ICU survival.

Methods

Retrospective review of a prospectively acquired ICU database (01/2000–12/2010) including all OHCA patients without obvious extracardiac cause, for which an early diagnosis research was conducted (coronary angiography and/or brain and chest CT scan) within 24h after resuscitation. These procedures could be performed separately or be combined, according to a decision algorithm.

Results

Of the 1274 patients admitted after OHCA during this 10-year period, the imaging strategy was applied in 896 patients. Patients who benefited from coronary angiography and/or CT scan were admitted to our ICU after a median delay of 180 [130–220]min after resuscitation. Seven hundred and forty-five coronary angiographies were performed, of which 452 (61%) identified at least one significant coronary lesion deemed responsible for the OHCA. CT-scan was performed in 355 patients and provided a diagnosis in 72 patients (20%), mainly stroke (n = 38) and pulmonary embolism (n = 19). Overall, this strategy allowed early diagnosis in 524 patients (59%). ICU survival was significantly higher for patients with a diagnosis identified by coronary angiography as compared with CT-scan (43% vs 10%, p < 0.001).

Conclusion

The use of an early diagnosis protocol with immediate coronary angiography and/or CT scan provided the etiology of nearly two thirds of OHCA cases. In this large retrospective database, coronary angiography yielded a better diagnostic value than brain and/or chest CT-scan.

### Expedited transfer to a cardiac arrest centre for non-ST-elevation out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (ARREST): a UK prospective, multicentre, parallel, randomised clinical trial [^115RLxVN]. Lancet (2023). Excellent credibility.

Added value of this study

The International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation has called for randomised trials of cardiac arrest centres. To our knowledge, ARREST is the first and only randomised trial of delivery to a cardiac arrest centre following resuscitated out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in the community and addresses an important unknown in post-resuscitation care.

Implications of all the available evidence

After cardiac arrest, the likelihood of survival did not increase despite the patients being delivered to a well resourced cardiac arrest centre with access to multiple facilities aimed at improving outcome. This finding is in contrast to the results from previous observational studies of cardiac arrest centres that showed a survival benefit. However, the results are consistent with the findings of trials examining post-resuscitation care including immediate angiography in the non-ST-elevation population and hypothermia, which did not show a survival benefit. We show that delivery of patients to the nearest emergency department after presumed cardiac arrest without ST elevation is a reasonable approach and has similar outcomes as delivery to a tertiary centre in the UK health-care setting.

### Timing of coronary angiography in survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest without obvious extracardiac causes [^111KJVad]. Resuscitation (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Indications and timing of coronary angiography in patients surviving out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) remain controversial. The aim of the present study was to assess the impact of an early invasive strategy in patients presenting with an OHCA and no obvious extracardiac cause.

Methods

Between January 1st 2009 and December 31st 2014 a total 612 survivors of OHCA were admitted to our institution. Patients with no obvious extracardiac cause (n = 507) were stratified into two groups: patients that underwent cardiac catheterization ≤ 3h (early invasive; n = 291) and patients not undergoing cardiac catheterization within 3h (non-early invasive; n = 216). Primary endpoint was all-cause mortality at 30days.

Results

All-cause 30-day mortality was 28.9% in the early invasive group vs. 36.6% in the non-early invasive group (log-rank p = 0.071). After propensity analyses, an early invasive strategy, as compared to a non-early strategy, was not associated with 30-day mortality (adjusted Hazard ratio [HR] 0.69; 95% CI 0.35–1.37; p = 0.029). Cox multivariable regression analyses demonstrated age (HR 1.04/year; 95% CI 1.02–1.07) and presentation with cardiogenic shock (HR 5.1; 95% CI 1.8–14.0) to be the sole independent predictors of 30-day mortality.

Conclusions

In this retrospective study, early coronary angiography (< 3h), as compared to a non-early invasive strategy, was not associated with reduced 30-day mortality in patients hospitalized after OHCA, irrespective of the presence of ST segment elevation or cardiogenic shock at presentation.

### Do out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients have increased chances of survival when transported to a cardiac resuscitation center? [^114XPwNJ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Out‐of‐hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is one of the leading causes of death in the United States, and it is a serious public health burden. 1 Despite an improvement in prehospital resuscitation practices, including an increased access to early cardiopulmonary resuscitation and defibrillation, mortality rates remain high, with only 10% of patients surviving to hospital discharge. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 To further decrease the mortality from OHCA, the establishment of a regionalized approach for the treatment of OHCA, including direct transport to specialized cardiac resuscitation centers, such as in the case of an ST‐segment–elevation myocardial infarction, has been proposed (class IIb, level of evidence C‐limited data). 5, 6, 7 For a hospital to be considered a cardiac resuscitation center, it must be able to provide diagnostic angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) on site at all times as well as targeted temperature management (TTM). 5 Indeed, most nontraumatic OHCA results from an acute coronary syndrome, and PCI is the preferred therapeutic procedure for that pathology. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 Patients remaining comatose following an OHCA also strongly benefit from some form of TTM. 10, 13, 14

Despite these recommendations made by the American Heart Association, few jurisdictions have implemented a regionalized approach for OHCA patients with designated receiving centers. As a result, there remains significant variation with regard to treatment standards for these patients. 15, 16 However, since these guidelines were published, multiple new studies have emerged, and their results could influence the decisions made for patients suffering from an OHCA.

To better evaluate the evidence on this subject, a systematic review and meta‐analysis of the currently available literature evaluating the association between the destination hospital capability (cardiac resuscitation center or not) and resuscitation outcomes (survival and survival with a good neurologic outcome) for patients suffering from an OHCA were performed.

### Effect of intensive care after cardiac arrest on patient outcome: a database analysis [^1141wqrC]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Cardiac arrest occurs in 375,000 adults in Europe every year. Overall survival to hospital discharge ranges from 8% to 10% for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, and is most commonly reported to be around 20% for in-hospital cardiac arrest. Several factors (patient related and resuscitation related) have been identified to have considerable impact on outcome. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation of good quality, with uninterrupted chest compressions as well as early defibrillation (depending on initial electrocardiogram rhythm) significantly improves the outcome after cardiac arrest. The etiology of cardiac arrest is also known to influence the prognosis. Of note is the fact that the outcome of patients resuscitated from cardiac arrest treated in different hospitals and intensive care units (ICUs) has shown a significant variability.

Hospital factors during the postresuscitation period and their implications for patient survival have long been underappreciated and have not been well defined. Geographic factors as well as the level of care of the centers involved influence outcome after cardiac arrest and cost effectiveness. The first standardized algorithms for the postresuscitation-care period have just recently been implemented in the European guidelines for resuscitation. Several hospital-related factors, such as hospital size and teaching status, have been identified to be of importance for the outcome after cardiac arrest, and regional differences have been described. With regard to the role models of acute coronary care units, stroke-, trauma-, and burn-injury centers, specialized cardiac arrest-care centers, as well as predefined treatment bundles for the postresuscitation period have become a subject of discussion recently.

The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of ICU-related factors and ICU characteristics on the patient's outcome after cardiac arrest. We furthermore suspected that the frequency of patients treated after cardiac arrest, the hospital size, and the capability to perform coronary angiography and intervention influence cardiac arrest mortality.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for cardiac arrest, more specifically with respect to post-resuscitation evaluation, coronary angiography, ACC/AHA/HRS 2018 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining CT or invasive coronary angiography to confirm the presence or absence of ischemic heart disease and guide decisions for myocardial revascularization in patients recovered from unexplained sudden cardiac arrest.

In the presence of this substantial selection bias, it is most pertinent to identify prognostic factors and the extent to which they drive a potential survival benefit. We analysed a select population of adult OHCA survivors with an initial shockable rhythm but no STE where the prevalence of CAD was still expected to be considerable, although lower than those with OHCA and STE. In the current cohort with OHCA, shockable rhythm and no STE, 73% of patients received CA, of whom 35% underwent PCI. Following multivariable adjustment, selection for CA was not an independent predictor of survival to hospital discharge. Contrary to previous observational reports, our study did not find early CA to be associated with a survival benefit over late CA or no CA. Several considerations may explain the lack of benefit of an early CA strategy in our cohort. First, the strategy of CA improving survival in patients with OHCA without STE is likely contingent on the presence of acute coronary lesion(s) amenable to PCI in the study group. In the absence of STE on postresuscitation ECG, previous reports have demonstrated the prevalence of significant CAD and acute coronary lesion(s) to be 25%‒50% and 25%‒35%, respectively. In keeping with these reports, 35% of patients in our cohort had at least one culprit coronary lesion treated with PCI and thus, the benefit from CA can only be expected for this subgroup if revascularization was successfully achieved. A strategy of unselected CA for all other patients with OHCA, and no STE may delay the diagnosis of alternative aetiologies for cardiac arrest (e.g. pulmonary embolism, aortic dissection, alcohol/drug poisoning, traumatic brain/medullar injury) and their timely treatment, and the added unnecessary risk of procedural complications related to CA. Furthermore, 37% of patients in our study successfully resuscitated following OHCA suffered from hypoxic brain injury, consistent with rates reported by other contemporary reports. It is recognized that poor neurological recovery rather than ongoing cardiac injury has a greater effect on short‐term mortality, thus counterbalancing the potential survival benefit for those with successful early revascularization. Four RCTs evaluating the benefit of an early CA strategy in those presenting with OHCA and no STE did not demonstrate superiority over delayed or selective CA with respect to short‐ and midterm all‐cause mortality. Notably, patients with CS were excluded from TOMAHAWK and COACT but included in EMERGE and PEARL RCTs. Taken together, the evaluation of patients presenting with OHCA, shockable rhythm and no STE on post‐resuscitation ECG warrants a more cautious approach with consideration of noncoronary causes of cardiac arrest and delaying CA to permit adequate assessment of patients' comorbidities, CAD history, the success of their initial and postarrest resuscitation efforts, as well as their postarrest neurological status.

Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Patients with out‐of‐hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) due to shockable presenting rhythms are refractory to standard advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) therapies in more than half of cases, resulting in a survival rate of 5% to 10%. Acute coronary syndromes with obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) are thought to be the primary cause of refractory shockable OHCA. However, the role of revascularization in these patients remains unclear.

Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) has improved neurologically favorable survival outcomes in patients with refractory cardiac arrest whose initial rhythm was ventricular fibrillation (VF) or pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VT).ECPR provides an artificial return of circulation with restoration of tissue blood flow and oxygenation. For patients with obstructive coronary artery disease, resumption of blood flow to cardiac tissue requires revascularization. Therefore, many ECPR protocols include coronary angiography for all patients after extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) cannulation followed by immediate percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) when clinically indicated. However, restoration of cardiac function and recovery also require conversion of the shockable presenting rhythm into an organized cardiac rhythm.

We therefore sought to analyze patients in refractory VT/VF OHCA who underwent ECPR and immediate coronary angiography with revascularization as indicated and examine the association between rhythm stabilization and ECMO perfusion, atherosclerotic burden, and revascularization.
