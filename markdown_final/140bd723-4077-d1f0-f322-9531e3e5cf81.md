## Question

bloodpressure of 59/71

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about a blood pressure reading of 59/71 mmHg, including whether this is physiologically plausible, what it means clinically, and what to do next. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the numbers are physiologically coherent and if the order of systolic and diastolic is correct. Then, I should verify the immediate clinical implications for perfusion and organ risk. Next, I will consider measurement error and the need for confirmation. After that, I should review guideline-based thresholds and risk stratification. Finally, I will outline a practical, stepwise management plan and summarize the key takeaways with appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the basics: a recorded blood pressure of 59/71 mmHg reverses the usual order, since systolic pressure must always be higher than diastolic pressure. This is physiologically impossible as stated, so I need to check for a transcription error or device malfunction before drawing any clinical conclusions [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the clinical implications if the intended reading was 71/59 mmHg instead. That would represent a systolic of 71 mmHg and a diastolic of 59 mmHg, which is low and would yield a mean arterial pressure around 63 mmHg, close to the lower bound of what is generally considered adequate for organ perfusion in adults, though individual tolerance varies and some patients may be asymptomatic at this level while others are not [^56d26f11] [^ad4aca84].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should confirm the measurement itself because clinic and nonstandardized readings are frequently inaccurate. I need to ensure proper cuff size, patient positioning, and validated device technique, and then repeat measurements using standardized office BP or home/ambulatory monitoring to exclude white-coat or device error before labeling this as hypotension or changing therapy [^d753785d] [^45f1febb] [^c2b261e2].

> I will now examine the risk context. In patients with treated hypertension and already controlled systolic blood pressure, a diastolic below 60 mmHg has been associated with increased cardiovascular events, whereas a diastolic in the 70–80 mmHg range appears optimal. However, this pertains to treated patients with SBP less than 130 mmHg, so I should be cautious about extrapolating to someone with a native SBP of 71 mmHg without knowing the baseline and treatment status [^9d2afb84] [^1605a4cd].

> Next, I should review guideline thresholds to frame decisions. Major guidelines emphasize confirming elevated or discordant BP with out-of-office measurements before diagnosing hypertension or altering therapy; conversely, for low BP, they focus on symptoms, organ perfusion, and underlying causes rather than a single number, so I need to check for dizziness, syncope, fatigue, chest pain, or altered mentation and correlate with heart rate, volume status, and medications [^c2b261e2] [^d753785d].

> Let me consider immediate actions if the patient is symptomatic or the low BP is confirmed. I should assess for shock, dehydration, bleeding, sepsis, arrhythmias, or medication effects, obtain orthostatic vitals, and tailor resuscitation to a MAP that preserves perfusion, typically at least 65 mmHg in adults, while individualizing higher targets in those with chronic hypertension or specific comorbidities [^ad4aca84] [^60d7b1be].

> But wait, what if the patient is asymptomatic and this is a baseline low BP phenotype. In that case, I should confirm with repeated, standardized measurements, consider ambulatory or home BP to establish a true baseline, evaluate for reversible contributors such as over-treatment, autonomic dysfunction, or endocrine causes, and only adjust therapy if there is symptomatic hypotension, organ dysfunction, or a compelling risk-based rationale after shared decision-making [^d753785d] [^c2b261e2].

> I should double-check medication reconciliation because antihypertensives, diuretics, nitrates, opioids, and sedatives can lower BP. If the patient is on BP-lowering drugs and now has SBP in the 70s, dose reduction or discontinuation may be appropriate, whereas if this is untreated baseline physiology, observation and cause assessment are reasonable unless symptoms emerge [^notfound].

> In summary, I need to ensure the original 59/71 mmHg is corrected to 71/59 mmHg, confirm the reading with proper technique and out-of-office data, assess symptoms and perfusion, and manage based on etiology and patient-specific risk rather than a single low value. If confirmed and symptomatic, treat to restore adequate MAP. If asymptomatic and confirmed, monitor and investigate causes. If due to therapy, modify treatment. If a baseline variant, observe with education and follow-up [^d753785d] [^c2b261e2] [^ad4aca84].

The reading 59/71 mmHg is **physiologically impossible** because diastolic pressure cannot exceed systolic pressure. This almost always reflects a **measurement error** — such as cuff misplacement, device malfunction, or transcription mistake. Please confirm the reading with a **properly calibrated device**, correct cuff size, and standardized technique [^d753785d] [^45f1febb]. If the numbers are reversed (71/59 mmHg), that would indicate low blood pressure and should be interpreted in clinical context, including symptoms and baseline BP, with repeat measurements to verify accuracy [^9d2afb84].

---

## Physiological plausibility

- **Normal physiology**: Systolic pressure (top number) reflects peak arterial pressure during cardiac contraction and is always higher than diastolic pressure (bottom number), which reflects resting arterial pressure between beats.
- **Impossible reading**: A diastolic value (71 mmHg) higher than systolic (59 mmHg) is physiologically impossible and indicates a measurement error.
- **Common errors**: Cuff misplacement, improper cuff size, device malfunction, or transcription mistakes can produce such anomalies [^d753785d] [^45f1febb].

---

## Clinical significance and interpretation

- **Measurement error**: The most likely explanation is a mistake in recording or device use; confirm with repeat measurements using proper technique [^d753785d].
- **If reversed (71/59 mmHg)**: This would indicate low blood pressure (hypotension), which may be normal for some individuals but can cause symptoms (dizziness, fainting) or indicate underlying issues if new or symptomatic [^9d2afb84].
- **Context matters**: Interpret any low reading alongside symptoms, baseline BP, and comorbidities; repeat measurements are essential to verify accuracy [^c2b261e2].

---

## Recommended actions

- **Verify immediately**: Repeat the measurement with a validated device, correct cuff size, and standardized technique (rest 5 minutes, arm at heart level, no talking) [^d753785d] [^45f1febb].
- **Check device and technique**: Ensure the cuff is on the upper arm, the device is calibrated, and the patient is positioned properly [^06b070bb].
- **Document and report**: Record the anomaly and confirm the corrected reading before making clinical decisions [^d753785d].
- **If low BP is confirmed**: Assess for symptoms, review medications, and consider causes such as dehydration, anemia, or autonomic dysfunction; escalate care if symptomatic or if there is concern for shock (MAP < 65 mmHg) [^ad4aca84].

---

## Conclusion

The reading 59/71 mmHg is **not physiologically possible** and most likely reflects a **measurement error**. Confirm with proper technique and equipment, and interpret any corrected low reading in clinical context.

Recent guidelines on diagnosis and management of high blood pressure (BP) include substantial changes and several new concepts compared with previous guidelines. These are reviewed and their clinical implications are discussed in this article. The goal is to provide a practical reference to assist clinicians with up-to-date management of patients with high BP. Important issues include new diagnostic thresholds, out-of-office BP monitoring, intensified treatment goals, and a different approach to resistant hypertension. Finally, differences among guidelines, the persistent controversies that have led to them, and their implications for clinical practice are discussed.

### Treatment blood pressure targets for hypertension [^bf16a63f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

When treating elevated blood pressure, doctors need to know what blood pressure (BP) target they should try to achieve. The standard of clinical practice for some time has been ≤ 140–160/ 90–100 mmHg. New guidelines are recommending BP targets lower than this standard. It is not known whether attempting to achieve targets lower than the standard reduces mortality and morbidity.

Objectives

To determine if lower BP targets (≤ 135/85 mmHg) are associated with reduction in mortality and morbidity as compared with standard BP targets (≤ 140–160/ 90–100 mmHg).

Search Strategy

Electronic search of MEDLINE (1966–2008), EMBASE (1980–2008), and CENTRAL (up to June 2008); references from review articles, clinical guidelines, and clinical trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials comparing patients randomized to lower or to standard BP targets and providing data on any of the primary outcomes below.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers (JAA, MIP) independently assessed the included trials and data entry. Primary outcomes were total mortality; total serious adverse events; total cardiovascular events; myocardial infarction, stroke, congestive heart failure and end stage renal disease. Secondary outcomes were achieved mean systolic and diastolic BP and withdrawals due to adverse effects.

Main Results

No trials comparing different systolic BP targets were found. Seven trials (22,089 subjects) comparing different diastolic BP targets were included. Despite a -4/-3 mmHg greater achieved reduction in systolic/diastolic BP, p < 0.001, attempting to achieve "lower targets" instead of "standard targets" did not change total mortality (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.86–1.15), myocardial infarction (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.74–1.09), stroke (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.79–1.25), congestive heart failure (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.59–1.32), major cardiovascular events (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.83–1.07), or end-stage renal disease (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.81–1.27). The net health effect of lower targets cannot be fully assessed due to lack of information regarding all total serious adverse events and withdrawals due to adverse effects in 6 of 7 trials. A sensitivity analysis in diabetic patients and in patients with chronic renal disease also did not show a reduction in any of the mortality and morbidity outcomes with lower targets as compared to standard targets.

Authors' Conclusions

Treating patients to lower than standard BP targets, ≤ 140–160/90–100 mmHg, does not reduce mortality or morbidity. Because guidelines are recommending even lower targets for diabetes mellitus and chronic renal disease, we are currently conducting systematic reviews in those groups of patients.

### Evaluation of optimal diastolic blood pressure range among adults with treated systolic blood pressure less than 130 mm Hg [^9d2afb84]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What are the safe and optimal diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ranges among adults with treated systolic blood pressure (SBP) of less than 130 mm Hg?

Findings

In this cohort study of 7515 patients from 2 randomized clinical trials who had treated SBP of less than 130 mm Hg, a DBP of less than 60 mm Hg was associated with increased cardiovascular risk and a DBP between 70 and 80 mm Hg was associated with lower cardiovascular risk.

Meaning

The findings suggest that a DBP of less than 60 mm Hg may be harmful and a DBP between 70 and 80 mm Hg is an optimal target for patients with treated SBP of less than 130 mm Hg; this topic merits further study.

JNC 8 hypertension guideline — blood pressure (BP) treatment targets by age and comorbidity are specified: There is strong evidence to support treating hypertensive persons aged 60 years or older to a BP goal of less than 150/90 mm Hg and hypertensive persons 30 through 59 years of age to a diastolic goal of less than 90 mm Hg; however, for hypertensive persons younger than 60 years for a systolic goal, or those younger than 30 years for a diastolic goal, the panel recommends a BP of less than 140/90 mm Hg based on expert opinion, and the same thresholds and goals are recommended for hypertensive adults with diabetes or nondiabetic chronic kidney disease (CKD) as for the general hypertensive population younger than 60 years.

Heart failure risk factors — white coat hypertension: White coat hypertension is characterized by elevated office blood pressure but normal readings when measured outside the office with either ambulatory blood pressure monitoring or home blood pressure monitoring, and the white coat effect is usually considered clinically significant when office systolic and diastolic blood pressures are ≥ 20/10 mm Hg higher than home blood pressure monitoring or ambulatory blood pressures.

### Advancing risk-based approaches in blood pressure management: reflections on the 2025 AHA / ACC statement [^c870bffa]. Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

According to the 2017 Guideline, 68 million individuals had uncontrolled hypertension and were recommended for antihypertensive therapy; of these, 35 million were untreated, and 33 million were receiving treatment but had not attained target BP levels. We advocate for the application of risk stratification to guide priority interventions in both cohorts, informing optimal escalation strategies for those inadequately controlled, and prioritizing interventions to address nontreatment in the untreated population. Drawing a parallel with lipid-lowering therapy, it is both rational and evidence-based to ensure that individuals at the highest risk receive the most effective — and, where appropriate, more intensive — therapeutic regimens. We propose that BP-lowering interventions should be classified by intensity, analogous to lipid-lowering therapies: low, moderate, and high intensity, corresponding to reductions in systolic BP of < 10, 10 to 19, and ≥ 20 mm Hg, respectively. Those at the highest absolute risk should generally be prioritized for high-intensity regimens, provided adverse effects do not preclude their use. Achieving a mean SBP of ≤ 120 mm Hg is essential to maintain the majority of BP readings below 130/80 mm Hg over time, given the natural intraindividual variability in BP. Thus, all patients with untreated mean SBP > 140 mm Hg will require high-intensity regimens to attain and sustain optimal BP control and minimize cardiovascular risk. The substantial expansion of high-intensity therapy should therefore be directed primarily towards individuals at the highest absolute risk and with the greatest gap to achieving optimal BP. Given the heightened urgency in patients with high predicted risk, immediate pharmacological intervention — potentially with dual therapy — should be considered as the default strategy. Naturally, this approach must be tailored to patient preferences and tolerability; nonetheless, the evidence increasingly supports early, decisive intervention in those most likely to benefit.

### Is 60 the new 80 in hypertension? [^99078bf1]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Since the release of the "2014 evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adults: report from the panel members appointed to the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8)", much controversy has ensued over the appropriate systolic blood pressure goal for those over the age of 60 years. This guideline suggested liberalizing the target for this population to < 150 mmHg, moving away from previous guidelines suggesting a target of < 140 mmHg. While some national quality measures have accepted the new relaxed blood pressure goal, the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology have not. Recently published data show that millions of adults over 60 years of age would be classified as controlled using a threshold of < 150 mmHg, but not with a target of < 140 mmHg. In addition, emerging randomized trial evidence suggests that targeting a systolic blood pressure well below 140 mmHg is beneficial in older adults. In light of the improved health and vitality of older adults, and the steady decline in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular mortality over recent decades, we do not think it is in good judgment to liberalize the treatment target in adults less than 80 years of age.

### Pharmacological blood pressure lowering for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease across different levels of blood pressure: an individual participant-level data meta-analysis [^8c11f322]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Our study fills the aforementioned gaps in evidence and provides compelling evidence from randomised trials for the beneficial effects of blood pressure-lowering treatment across the spectrum of systolic blood pressure in people with or without a known diagnosis of cardiovascular disease. Our findings do not substantiate concerns about a J-shaped association between blood pressure and cardiovascular outcomes in observational studies, and dismiss the suggestions that blood pressure-lowering treatment is only effective when blood pressure is above a certain threshold.

These findings have important implications for clinical practice. Currently, the approach to prescribing antihypertensives depends on an individual's previous history of cardiovascular disease and blood pressure value. Although guidelines vary on the degree of their emphasis on these two risk factors, they invariably modify recommendations based on them. For instance, New Zealand has largely abandoned the approach of treating hypertension and recommends screening adults for overall cardiovascular risk as the first stage towards clinical decision making. Nonetheless, in the second stage, those ranked to be at high risk of cardiovascular disease are additionally required to have a high blood pressure to qualify for antihypertensive treatment. Most other guidelines have an even stronger reliance on blood pressure, often with explicit criteria for diagnosis of hypertension in the first stage and then consideration of treatment at the second stage in a subset of hypertensive participants. For instance, in England, blood pressure-lowering treatment for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease is not considered as relevant when baseline systolic blood pressure is less than 140 mm Hg. Most guidelines also define a floor level for reducing blood pressure, assuming that lowering blood pressure below a common threshold would be ineffective or to have an uncertain or even detrimental effect.

Our study calls for a revision of these guidelines. The finding that a fixed and modest degree of blood pressure reduction is expected to lead to similar relative reductions in risk of cardiovascular events, regardless of current blood pressure or presence of ischaemic heart disease and stroke, calls for consideration of blood pressure-lowering treatment for any individual who has a sufficiently high absolute risk of cardiovascular disease. By considering antihypertensives as a tool for reducing cardiovascular risk, rather than simply reducing blood pressure, clinicians are no longer required to make decisions according to an arbitrary and confusing classification of hypertension. The need for and the burden of exact measurement of blood pressure is also reduced. This will not only simplify decision-making, management, and communication of treatment strategies with participants but, as shown in previous modelling studies, will also lead to more efficient care compared with alternative strategies that rely more heavily on absolute blood pressure values.

Blood pressure measurement — button-initiated first reading and repeats after rest: After the five-minute rest period, initiate the first inflation/reading by pushing the device button and record systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). Take subsequent readings with at least a 30 second interval between readings, record SBP and DBP for each reading, and then record the average or median SBP and average or median DBP as the patient's blood pressure.

### 2014 evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adults: report from the panel members appointed to the eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) [^badb5408]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

JNC 8 — Evidence summary for Recommendation 1 reports that "Recommendation 1 is based on evidence statements 1 through 3 from question 2 in which there is moderate- to high-quality evidence from RCTs that in the general population aged 60 years or older, treating high BP to a goal of lower than 150/90 mm Hg reduces stroke, heart failure, and coronary heart disease (CHD)", and "There is also evidence (albeit lower quality) from evidence statement 6, question 2 that setting a goal SBP of lower than 140 mm Hg in this age group provides no additional benefit compared with a higher goal SBP of 140 to 160 mm Hg or 140 to 149 mm Hg"; it further notes that "there are many treated hypertensive patients aged 60 years or older in whom SBP is currently lower than 140 mm Hg, based on implementation of previous guideline recommendations".

### Effects of blood pressure lowering on outcome incidence in hypertension: 2. effects at different baseline and achieved blood pressure levels – overview and meta-analyses of randomized trials [^5841b9a5]. Journal of Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Relevant clinical questions not approached by randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of blood pressure (BP)-lowering treatment can be explored by meta-analyses stratified by clinical criteria.

Objectives

Investigating whether all grades of hypertension benefit from BP-lowering treatment and which are the target BP levels to maximize outcome reduction.

Methods

Of the 68 RCTs of intentional and nonintentional BP-lowering, those without baseline antihypertensive drugs were stratified by the average baseline SBP and DBP (hypertension grades 1, 2, and 3). RCTs with or without baseline treatment were considered for investigating the effects of mean achieved SBP/DBP across three SBP cutoffs and two DBP cutoffs. Risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) (random-effects model), standardized to 10/5mmHg SBP/DBP reduction, and absolute risk reductions of seven fatal and nonfatal outcomes were calculated. Differences between relative and absolute risk reductions in the different strata of baseline or achieved SBP/DBP were evaluated by trend or heterogeneity analyses.

Results

In 32 RCTs (104,359 individuals), significant outcome reductions were found independently of the hypertension grade, with no trend toward risk ratio changes with increasing baseline BP. A secondary analysis limited to RCTs on grade 1 hypertension at low-to-moderate risk showed significant outcome reductions [risk ratio: stroke 0.33 (0.11–0.98), coronary events 0.68 (0.48–0.95), and death 0.53 (0.35–0.80)]. In 32 RCTs (128,232 individuals), relative and absolute outcome reductions were significant for the SBP differences across 150 and 140mmHg cutoffs. Below 130mmHg, only stroke and all-cause death were significantly reduced. Absolute outcome reduction showed a significant trend to decrease, the lower the SBP cutoff considered. In 29 RCTs (107,665 individuals), outcomes were significantly reduced across DBP cutoffs of 90 and 80mmHg. After excluding RCTs with baseline DBP less than 90mmHg, only stroke reduction was significant at achieved DBP less than 80mmHg.

Conclusion

Meta-analyses favor BP-lowering treatment even in grade 1 hypertension at low-to-moderate risk, and lowering SBP/DBP to less than 140/90mmHg. Achieving less than 130/80mmHg appears safe, but only adds further reduction in stroke.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of adult patients with asymptomatic hypertension in the emergency department [^3bff005b]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2006). Medium credibility.

Emergency department (ED) blood pressure measurement count — "According to JNC 7, at least 2 measurements of blood pressure should be obtained in the office setting after the patient has been sitting quietly in a chair for at least 5 minutes". Although "such controlled conditions are difficult to reproduce in an ED", "evidence from several studies suggests that 2 separate blood pressure measurements in the ED setting are adequate for screening patients with elevated blood pressure readings". In a protocol, "Of the 203 patients enrolled, 71 patients had an elevated initial blood pressure measurement" and "Although the protocol involved 3 separate blood pressure measurements, post hoc analysis revealed that 68 of 71 hypertensive patients would have been detected if only 2 blood pressure measurements were obtained". Interobserver variability was shown when "Edmonds et al12 prospectively followed 140 ED patients who had vital signs measured by 2 independent observers", finding "a mean difference between observers of 1.3 mm Hg and an expected range of agreement of 24.2 mm Hg in systolic blood pressure", and overall, "in the ED, 2 blood pressure measurements are adequate for screening purposes".

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of adult patients with asymptomatic hypertension in the emergency department [^bc696b73]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2006). Medium credibility.

Known hypertension — prospective multicenter observational data indicate that sphygmomanometric blood pressures obtained in both the office and ambulatory setting were prognostic: both office and ambulatory measurements of systolic and diastolic blood pressure significantly predicted the primary endpoint of fatal or nonfatal cardiovascular events; however, blood pressures were not obtained in the emergency setting and 3 blood pressure readings were obtained on separate visits, which is not feasible in an emergency setting.

### First-line drugs for hypertension [^a633a2d5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

This is the first update of a review published in 2009. Sustained moderate to severe elevations in resting blood pressure leads to a critically important clinical question: What class of drug to use first-line? This review attempted to answer that question.

Objectives

To quantify the mortality and morbidity effects from different first-line antihypertensive drug classes: thiazides (low-dose and high-dose), beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB), and alpha-blockers, compared to placebo or no treatment. Secondary objectives: when different antihypertensive drug classes are used as the first-line drug, to quantify the blood pressure lowering effect and the rate of withdrawal due to adverse drug effects, compared to placebo or no treatment.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials up to November 2017: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work.

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials (RCT) of at least one year duration, comparing one of six major drug classes with a placebo or no treatment, in adult patients with blood pressure over 140/90 mmHg at baseline. The majority (over 70%) of the patients in the treatment group were taking the drug class of interest after one year. We included trials with both hypertensive and normotensive patients in this review if the majority (over 70%) of patients had elevated blood pressure, or the trial separately reported outcome data on patients with elevated blood pressure.

Data Collection and Analysis

The outcomes assessed were mortality, stroke, coronary heart disease (CHD), total cardiovascular events (CVS), decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and withdrawals due to adverse drug effects. We used a fixed-effect model to to combine dichotomous outcomes across trials and calculate risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). We presented blood pressure data as mean difference (MD) with 99% CI.

Main Results

The 2017 updated search failed to identify any new trials. The original review identified 24 trials with 28 active treatment arms, including 58,040 patients. We found no RCTs for ARBs or alpha-blockers. These results are mostly applicable to adult patients with moderate to severe primary hypertension. The mean age of participants was 56 years, and mean duration of follow-up was three to five years. High-quality evidence showed that first-line low-dose thiazides reduced mortality (11.0% with control versus 9.8% with treatment; RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.97); total CVS (12.9% with control versus 9.0% with treatment; RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.76), stroke (6.2% with control versus 4.2% with treatment; RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.77), and coronary heart disease (3.9% with control versus 2.8% with treatment; RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.84). Low- to moderate-quality evidence showed that first-line high-dose thiazides reduced stroke (1.9% with control versus 0.9% with treatment; RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.61) and total CVS (5.1% with control versus 3.7% with treatment; RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.82), but did not reduce mortality (3.1% with control versus 2.8% with treatment; RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.05), or coronary heart disease (2.7% with control versus 2.7% with treatment; RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.20). Low- to moderate-quality evidence showed that first-line beta-blockers did not reduce mortality (6.2% with control versus 6.0% with treatment; RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.07) or coronary heart disease (4.4% with control versus 3.9% with treatment; RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.03), but reduced stroke (3.4% with control versus 2.8% with treatment; RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.97) and total CVS (7.6% with control versus 6.8% with treatment; RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.98). Low- to moderate-quality evidence showed that first-line ACE inhibitors reduced mortality (13.6% with control versus 11.3% with treatment; RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.95), stroke (6.0% with control versus 3.9% with treatment; RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.82), coronary heart disease (13.5% with control versus 11.0% with treatment; RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.94), and total CVS (20.1% with control versus 15.3% with treatment; RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.85). Low-quality evidence showed that first-line calcium channel blockers reduced stroke (3.4% with control versus 1.9% with treatment; RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.84) and total CVS (8.0% with control versus 5.7% with treatment; RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.87), but not coronary heart disease (3.1% with control versus 2.4% with treatment; RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.09), or mortality (6.0% with control versus 5.1% with treatment; RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.09). There was low-quality evidence that withdrawals due to adverse effects were increased with first-line low-dose thiazides (5.0% with control versus 11.3% with treatment; RR 2.38, 95% CI 2.06 to 2.75), high-dose thiazides (2.2% with control versus 9.8% with treatment; RR 4.48, 95% CI 3.83 to 5.24), and beta-blockers (3.1% with control versus 14.4% with treatment; RR 4.59, 95% CI 4.11 to 5.13). No data for these outcomes were available for first-line ACE inhibitors or calcium channel blockers. The blood pressure data were not used to assess the effect of the different classes of drugs as the data were heterogeneous, and the number of drugs used in the trials differed.

Authors' Conclusions

First-line low-dose thiazides reduced all morbidity and mortality outcomes in adult patients with moderate to severe primary hypertension. First-line ACE inhibitors and calcium channel blockers may be similarly effective, but the evidence was of lower quality. First-line high-dose thiazides and first-line beta-blockers were inferior to first-line low-dose thiazides.

### Association between baseline diastolic blood pressure and the efficacy of intensive vs standard blood pressure-lowering therapy [^760b4e0f]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is there an interaction between baseline diastolic blood pressure and intensification of blood pressure–lowering therapy for survival and cardiovascular outcomes?

Findings

In this cohort study of 14 094 patients from 2 large randomized clinical trials, baseline DBP of 80 and 90 mm Hg were associated with significant reductions in the risk of a composite cardiovascular end point that included cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke. The same was not true for the outcome of all-cause death.

Meaning

The findings of this study suggest that further work is needed to determine whether blood-pressure lowering therapy should be intensified in patients whose diastolic blood pressure is low.

### Pharmacological blood pressure lowering for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease across different levels of blood pressure: an individual participant-level data meta-analysis [^06976181]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Summary

Background

The effects of pharmacological blood pressure lowering at normal or high-normal blood pressure ranges in people with or without pre-existing cardiovascular disease remains uncertain. We analysed individual participant data from randomised trials to investigate the effects of blood pressure lowering treatment on the risk of major cardiovascular events by baseline levels of systolic blood pressure.

Methods

We did a meta-analysis of individual participant-level data from 48 randomised trials of pharmacological blood pressure lowering medications versus placebo or other classes of blood pressure-lowering medications, or between more versus less intensive treatment regimens, which had at least 1000 persons-years of follow-up in each group. Trials exclusively done with participants with heart failure or short-term interventions in participants with acute myocardial infarction or other acute settings were excluded. Data from 51 studies published between 1972 and 2013 were obtained by the Blood Pressure Lowering Treatment Trialists' Collaboration (Oxford University, Oxford, UK). We pooled the data to investigate the stratified effects of blood pressure-lowering treatment in participants with and without prevalent cardiovascular disease (ie, any reports of stroke, myocardial infarction, or ischaemic heart disease before randomisation), overall and across seven systolic blood pressure categories (ranging from < 120 to ≥ 170 mm Hg). The primary outcome was a major cardiovascular event (defined as a composite of fatal and non-fatal stroke, fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, or heart failure causing death or requiring admission to hospital), analysed as per intention to treat.

Findings

Data for 344 716 participants from 48 randomised clinical trials were available for this analysis. Pre-randomisation mean systolic/diastolic blood pressures were 146/84 mm Hg in participants with previous cardiovascular disease (n = 157 728) and 157/89 mm Hg in participants without previous cardiovascular disease (n = 186 988). There was substantial spread in participants' blood pressure at baseline, with 31 239 (19·8%) of participants with previous cardiovascular disease and 14 928 (8·0%) of individuals without previous cardiovascular disease having a systolic blood pressure of less than 130 mm Hg. The relative effects of blood pressure-lowering treatment were proportional to the intensity of systolic blood pressure reduction. After a median 4·15 years' follow-up (Q1–Q3 2·97–4·96), 42 324 participants (12·3%) had at least one major cardiovascular event. In participants without previous cardiovascular disease at baseline, the incidence rate for developing a major cardiovascular event per 1000 person-years was 31·9 (95% CI 31·3–32·5) in the comparator group and 25·9 (25·4–26·4) in the intervention group. In participants with previous cardiovascular disease at baseline, the corresponding rates were 39·7 (95% CI 39·0–40·5) and 36·0 (95% CI 35·3–36·7), in the comparator and intervention groups, respectively. Hazard ratios (HR) associated with a reduction of systolic blood pressure by 5 mm Hg for a major cardiovascular event were 0·91, 95% CI 0·89–0·94 for partipants without previous cardiovascular disease and 0·89, 0·86–0·92, for those with previous cardiovascular disease. In stratified analyses, there was no reliable evidence of heterogeneity of treatment effects on major cardiovascular events by baseline cardiovascular disease status or systolic blood pressure categories.

Interpretation

In this large-scale analysis of randomised trials, a 5 mm Hg reduction of systolic blood pressure reduced the risk of major cardiovascular events by about 10%, irrespective of previous diagnoses of cardiovascular disease, and even at normal or high–normal blood pressure values. These findings suggest that a fixed degree of pharmacological blood pressure lowering is similarly effective for primary and secondary prevention of major cardiovascular disease, even at blood pressure levels currently not considered for treatment. Physicians communicating the indication for blood pressure lowering treatment to their patients should emphasise its importance on reducing cardiovascular risk rather than focusing on blood pressure reduction itself.

Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Hypertension targets and outcomes in adults aged 60 years or older — evidence revisions report that among patients with a baseline systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 160 mm Hg or greater who achieved a target SBP of less than 150 mm Hg, all-cause mortality reduction did not quite reach statistical significance (RR, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.85 to 1.00]; ARR, 1.13), while high-quality evidence showed reductions in stroke (RR, 0.77 [CI, 0.64 to 0.91]; ARR, 0.92) and cardiac events (RR, 0.83 [CI, 0.71 to 0.96]; ARR, 0.72). In studies with lower SBP targets (< 140 mm Hg), low-quality evidence showed no statistically significant reduction in all-cause mortality (RR, 0.93 [CI, 0.75 to 1.14]; ARR, 0.21), cardiac events (RR, 0.91 [CI, 0.77 to 1.04]; ARR, 0.35), or stroke (RR, 0.88 [CI, 0.64 to 1.01]; ARR, 0.19) compared with higher BP targets, and many studies did not achieve the targeted BP with little difference between intensive treatment and control groups. In the figure, the benefits statements read that "Incidence of stroke and cardiac events were reduced with treatment to < 150 mm Hg" and "Treating to 140 mm Hg did not have additional benefit".

### Evaluation and treatment of severe asymptomatic hypertension [^536bfb18]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Poorly controlled hypertension is a common finding in the outpatient setting. When patients present with severely elevated blood pressure (i.e., systolic blood pressure of 180 mm Hg or greater, or diastolic blood pressure of 110 mm Hg or greater), physicians need to differentiate hypertensive emergency from severely elevated blood pressure without signs or symptoms of end-organ damage (severe asymptomatic hypertension). Most patients who are asymptomatic but have poorly controlled hypertension do not have acute end-organ damage and, therefore, do not require immediate workup or treatment (within 24 hours). However, physicians should confirm blood pressure readings and appropriately classify the hypertensive state. A cardiovascular risk profile is important in guiding the treatment of severe asymptomatic hypertension; higher risk patients may benefit from more urgent and aggressive evaluation and treatment. Oral agents may be initiated before discharge, but intravenous medications and fast-acting oral agents should be reserved for true hypertensive emergencies. High blood pressure should be treated gradually. Appropriate, repeated follow-up over weeks to months is needed to reach desired blood pressure goals.

Oscillometric blood pressure (BP) devices — device selection and comparability — are described as follows: oscillometric BP devices may be preferred over manual BP devices, but manual BP devices are also acceptable when oscillometric devices are unavailable. Studies that directly compared standardized office BP measured using an oscillometric device versus a manual device do not suggest overt differences in readings between these 2 types of devices, and all BP measurement devices are validated and calibrated against mercury sphygmomanometers, therefore BP levels from trials using different types of standardized office BP measurements should, in general, be comparable. In settings where oscillometric devices are not available, providers may use a manual BP device with proper calibration, and regardless of device type, proper preparation and BP measurement techniques are paramount.

Chronic kidney disease blood pressure measurement — device selection — states that oscillometric blood pressure (BP) devices may be preferred over manual BP devices, but manual devices are also acceptable when oscillometric devices are unavailable, with emphasis on obtaining standardized BP measurements according to recommended preparation procedures; randomized controlled trials and prospective cohort studies used standardized office BP with either oscillometric or manual devices, studies directly comparing them do not suggest overt differences in readings, all BP devices are validated and calibrated against mercury sphygmomanometers so readings would be expected to be similar, and therefore BP levels from trials using different standardized office methods should, in general, be comparable; negative aspects of oscillometric devices include potentially higher cost, the requirement of an electric power source, and lack of flexibility due to specific cuff sizes; in areas where oscillometric devices are not available, providers may use a manual BP device but proper calibration is required, and regardless of device type, proper preparation and BP measurement techniques are paramount.

### Harmonization of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association and European Society of Cardiology / European Society of Hypertension blood pressure / hypertension guidelines [^1318e12d]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

The 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association and 2018 European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension clinical practice guidelines for management of high blood pressure/hypertension are influential documents. Both guidelines are comprehensive, were developed using rigorous processes, and underwent extensive peer review. The most notable difference between the 2 guidelines is the blood pressure cut points recommended for the diagnosis of hypertension. There are also differences in the timing and intensity of treatment, with the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline recommending a somewhat more intensive approach. Overall, there is substantial concordance in the recommendations provided by the 2 guideline-writing committees, with greater congruity between them than their predecessors. Additional harmonization of future guidelines would help to underscore the commonality of their core recommendations and could serve to catalyze changes in practice that would lead to improved prevention, awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension, worldwide.

### Blood pressure assessment in adults in Clinical Practice and clinic-based research: JACC Scientific expert panel [^fa997b3c]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

The accurate measurement of blood pressure (BP) is essential for the diagnosis and management of hypertension. Restricted use of mercury devices, increased use of oscillometric devices, discrepancies between clinic and out-of-clinic BP, and concerns about measurement error with manual BP measurement techniques have resulted in uncertainty for clinicians and researchers. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the U.S. National Institutes of Health convened a working group of clinicians and researchers in October 2017 to review data on BP assessment among adults in clinical practice and clinic-based research. In this report, the authors review the topics discussed during a 2-day meeting including the current state of knowledge on BP assessment in clinical practice and clinic-based research, knowledge gaps pertaining to current BP assessment methods, research and clinical needs to improve BP assessment, and the strengths and limitations of using BP obtained in clinical practice for research and quality improvement activities.

### How well do clinic-based blood pressure measurements agree with the mercury standard? [^0f916a76]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Obtaining accurate blood pressure (BP) readings is a challenge faced by health professionals. Clinical trials implement strict protocols, whereas clinical practices and studies that assess quality of care utilize a less rigorous protocol for BP measurement.

Objective

To examine agreement between real-time clinic-based assessment of BP and the standard mercury assessment of BP.

Design

Prospective reliability study.

Patients

One hundred patients with an International Classification of Diseases-9th edition code for hypertension were enrolled.

Measures

Two BP measurements were obtained with the Hawksley random-zero mercury sphygmomanometer and averaged. The clinic-based BP was extracted from the computerized medical records.

Results

Agreement between the mercury and clinic-based systolic blood pressure (SBP) was good, intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) = 0.91 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.83 to 0.94); the agreement for the mercury and clinic-based diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was satisfactory, ICC = 0.77 (95% CI: 0.62 to 0.86). Overall, clinic-based readings overestimated the mercury readings, with a mean overestimation of 8.3 mmHg for SBP and 7.1 mmHg for DBP. Based on the clinic-based measure, 21% of patients were misdiagnosed with uncontrolled hypertension.

Conclusions

Health professionals should be aware of this potential difference when utilizing clinic-based BP values for making treatment decisions and/or assessing quality of care.

### Blood pressure: the lower, the better: the con side [^726f96c3]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Hypertension is one of the major modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality. It was recently shown that 7.6 million early deaths and 92 million disabled years are attributed to hypertension. Lowering blood pressure (BP) reduces CV morbidity and mortality. The benefit achieved in most hypertension outcomes studies was attributed to BP reduction, and the more aggressive the BP reduction, the greater the benefit. However, it is unclear what the target BP levels should be. Lewington et al. showed in a large collaborative meta-analysis that included 1 million adults with no previous vascular disease that usual BP is strongly and directly related to vascular (and overall) mortality, without any evidence of a threshold down to at least 115/75 mmHg. This observation led clinicians to believe that BP should be lowered to the lowest tolerable levels. Some of the guidelines even adopted this approach and recommended lowering BP to < 140/90 mmHg in all hypertensive patients, including the elderly, and to < 130/80 mmHg in diabetic and high-risk patients. The present review will analyze the available data showing that the notion "the lower, the better" is not evidence based and that there is evidence that lowering BP too aggressively may even be harmful.

Selection of Candidate Predictors

Candidate predictors considered for inclusion in the model were identified by literature review. Of the 60 identified, a total of 14 variables were considered for inclusion in the model, including age, sex, body mass index, diagnosis of hypertension and time from diagnosis, antihypertensive prescription, smoking status, alcohol consumption, diagnosis of cardiovascular disease, clinic blood pressure level (systolic/diastolic), and multiple clinic blood pressure characteristics defined as previously described. These characteristics were the difference between the first and last clinic blood pressure reading (referred to as the clinic blood pressure change [estimated from 3 or 6 readings]), the rate of the change in clinic blood pressure (referred to as the blood pressure slope [estimated from 3 or 6 readings]), and the curvature of this change in clinic blood pressure (referred to as the blood pressure quadratic [estimated from 6 readings]). Age, sex, and clinic blood pressure variables were included in the final model a priori because they were cited as significant predictors of white coat or masked hypertension in more than twice as many published studies compared with other predictors in a previous literature review. Backward stepwise selection was used to select the remaining candidate predictors for the final model. Only predictors reaching a significance level of P < 0.05 were included.

The HOT trial included a prespecified subgroup analysis in 1,501 diabetic subjects (age: 61.5 years; baseline BP: 170/105 mmHg), randomized to three different DBP targets: 90, 85, and 80 mmHg. Achieved BP was 144/85, 141/83, and 140/81 mmHg in the three target groups, respectively. A target of 80 mmHg significantly reduced both major cardiovascular event rates (11.9/1,000 person-years; RR 0.49; 95% CI, 0.29–0.81) and cardiovascular mortality (3.7/1,000 person-years; RR 0.33; 95% CI, 0.14–0.78) compared with a target of 90 mmHg (24.4/1,000 person-years and 11.1/1,000 person-years, respectively).

Emergency department asymptomatic elevated blood pressure — In a retrospective analysis of 2 prospective, longitudinal randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of asymptomatic patients with uncontrolled blood pressure defined as more than 140/90 mmHg or 160/90 mmHg, antihypertensive medications were initiated by the ED practitioner, with 217 patients enrolled including 124 women (57%) and 208 (96%) African American. The ED prescription group had a reduction of 11 mmHg in blood pressure at follow-up (95% CI 17 to 4 mmHg), and both groups had similar rates of adverse events (1.59 versus 1.43; difference = 0.16, 95% CI −0.34 to 0.67), with no new neurologic deficits, ischemic events, life-threatening anaphylactic reactions or clinically significant hypotension (SBP < 100 mmHg) reported in either group. Medication classes prescribed in the study were thiazide-like diuretics (54%), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (26%), calcium channel blockers (10%), and beta blockers (6%). The page references Joint National Committee 8 guidance recommending treating hypertensive persons aged more than 60 years to less than 150/90 mmHg and less than 140/90 mmHg for other groups, and concludes that there appears to be merit in contemplating the commencement of treatment for individuals arriving at the ED with asymptomatic elevated blood pressure.

### Conventional versus automated measurement of blood pressure in primary care patients with systolic hypertension: randomised parallel design controlled trial [^e2b9754b]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Should manual office blood pressure measurement be abandoned?

The mercury sphygmomanometer has been synonymous with blood pressure measurement for more than 100 years. Regardless of advances in alternative techniques for recording blood pressure, mercury seems destined to disappear from the workplace because of environmental concerns. Mercury is prohibited in at least two countries, and a recent report from the European Union suggests that a more widespread ban is imminent. The standard device for measuring blood pressure thus needs to be replaced, but the unknown factor is what comes next. Studies on white coat hypertension have identified a subset of about 25% of the hypertensive population who have clinically important increases in blood pressure when readings are taken in the treatment setting, especially by physicians. Even automated devices such as the BpTRU provoke a white coat response; readings are similar to manual office blood pressure if the observer remains present in the room when the reading is taken.

Studies comparing manual with automated office blood pressure have clearly shown that the increase in blood pressure associated with conventional manual office measurement can be eliminated if the three basic tenets of automated office blood pressure are followed: the patient rests alone in a quiet room, and multiple readings are taken with a fully automated device. The simple presence of an observer seems to increase blood pressure, as marked decreases in automated office blood pressure are evident within two minutes of the observer leaving the room, as seen in CAMBO and in a previous study.

The number of automated office blood pressure readings needed for the mean value to be equivalent to the awake ambulatory blood pressure depends on whether the patient rests before the first reading is taken. If current guidelines for manual office blood pressure are followed and the patient is allowed to rest for at least five minutes, only two or three readings may be needed. However, when five readings are taken at one minute intervals with devices such as the BpTRU, no antecedent period of rest is needed and mean readings are still equivalent to the awake ambulatory blood pressure. Also, readings obtained with the BpTRU are similar when taken at one or two minute intervals.

### Predicting out-of-office blood pressure level using repeated measurements in the clinic: an observational cohort study [^82b028c7]. Journal of Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

RESULTS

Of the 480 patients who enrolled in the trial and attended follow-up, 234 (49%) were randomized to the intervention arm (self-monitoring). Sufficient home monitoring blood pressure data were available from 220 patients (94%) (at least 4 days of readings within a week in the first month after randomization) who were subsequently included, as pre-specified for the primary analysis.

Demographic characteristics of those included in the analysis were similar to those in the original trial (Table 1). Mean age was 67 ± 9 years and just over half were female (53%). Most were of white ethnic origin (95%), baseline clinic blood pressure was raised (150/85 mmHg) and comorbidities were uncommon.

The overall mean difference in SBP between the first clinic reading taken and the mean home blood pressure in the first month was −14 ± 17 mmHg (home–clinic difference). The clinic blood pressure drop, slope and quadratic coefficients were all significantly associated with the home–clinic difference (Fig. 1). In the sensitivity analyses, this effect remained significant regardless of the population studied, the estimate of home–clinic difference used or the time point in the trial at which variables were compared (supplemental digital content, Table S1).

### Guideline-driven management of hypertension: an evidence-based update [^98e5ce8f]. Circulation Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Several important findings bearing on the prevention, detection, and management of hypertension have been reported since publication of the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Blood Pressure Guideline. This review summarizes and places in context the results of relevant observational studies, randomized clinical trials, and meta-analyses published between January 2018 and March 2021. Topics covered include blood pressure measurement, patient evaluation for secondary hypertension, cardiovascular disease risk assessment and blood pressure threshold for drug therapy, lifestyle and pharmacological management, treatment target blood pressure goal, management of hypertension in older adults, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, resistant hypertension, and optimization of care using patient, provider, and health system approaches. Presenting new information in each of these areas has the potential to increase hypertension awareness, treatment, and control which remain essential for the prevention of cardiovascular disease and mortality in the future.

### Thresholds for diagnosing hypertension based on automated office blood pressure measurements and cardiovascular risk [^1b580be0]. Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

The risk of cardiovascular events in relation to blood pressure is largely based on readings taken with a mercury sphygmomanometer in populations which differ from those of today in terms of hypertension severity and drug therapy. Given replacement of the mercury sphygmomanometer with electronic devices, we sought to determine the blood pressure threshold for a significant increase in cardiovascular risk using a fully automated device, which takes multiple readings with the subject resting quietly alone. Participants were 3627 community-dwelling residents aged > 65 years untreated for hypertension. Automated office blood pressure readings were obtained in a community pharmacy with subjects seated and undisturbed. This method for recording blood pressure produces similar readings in different settings, including a pharmacy and family doctor's office providing the above procedures are followed. Subjects were followed for a mean (SD) of 4.9 (1.0) years for fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events. Adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) were computed for 10 mm Hg increments in blood pressure (mm Hg) using Cox proportional hazards regression and the blood pressure category with the lowest event rate as the reference category. A total of 271 subjects experienced a cardiovascular event. There was a significant (P = 0.02) increase in the hazard ratio of 1.66 (1.09, 2.54) at a systolic blood pressure of 135 to 144 and 1.72 (1.21, 2.45; P = 0.003) at a diastolic blood pressure of 80 to 89. A significant (P = 0.03) increase in hazard ratio of 1.73 (1.04, 2.86) occurred with a pulse pressure of 80 to 89. These findings are consistent with a threshold of 135/85 for diagnosing hypertension in older subjects using automated office blood pressure.

### The highs and lows of blood pressure: toward meaningful clinical targets in patients with shock [^56d26f11]. Critical Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP)" for COVID-19 infection, preeclampsia, perioperative bleeding, perioperative cardiac risk management for noncardiac surgery, thoracic aortic dissection, brain death, cardiac arrest, cervical spine injury, traumatic brain injury, traumatic hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, intracerebral hemorrhage, acute ischemic stroke, hepatorenal syndrome, liver cirrhosis, acute liver failure, acute kidney injury, cardiogenic shock and sepsis and septic shock.

MAP calculates average arterial pressure during a cardiac cycle using systolic and diastolic blood pressure.

In the context of assessing circulatory health, the Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) calculator is a tool that processes two main inputs: systolic and diastolic blood pressures. These inputs are measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg), adhering to certain acceptable ranges for accuracy and safety — systolic values between 60 and 300 mmHg and diastolic values from 20 to 180 mmHg.

The calculation of MAP provides a crucial insight into the perfusion pressure experienced by vital organs, relying on a straightforward formula:

MAP = diastolic blood pressure + one-third of the pulse pressure (where pulse pressure is the difference between systolic and diastolic pressures).

This equation highlights that diastolic pressure, representing the longer-lasting phase of the cardiac cycle, exerts more influence in the calculation than systolic pressure. The resultant MAP, expressed in mmHg and ranging logically from 0 to 200 mmHg, signifies the average driving force of blood through the systemic circulation in a single cardiac cycle.

Understanding MAP values is essential in clinical environments:

- A MAP between 70 and 100 mmHg is typically ideal, suggesting optimal organ perfusion.
- MAP values falling below 60 mmHg may indicate potential risk for organ under-perfusion, a critical concern in intensive care settings.
- MAP exceeding 100 mmHg often points toward possible hypertension or other cardiovascular anomalies, necessitating further evaluation.

This calculated MAP value provides invaluable information used widely in clinical practice for observing and managing patients' blood pressure, aiding in the maintenance of proper organ function and overall cardiovascular health.

### Pharmacological blood pressure lowering for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease across different levels of blood pressure: an individual participant-level data meta-analysis [^e2fe557a]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Background

The effects of pharmacological blood pressure lowering at normal or high-normal blood pressure ranges in people with or without pre-existing cardiovascular disease remains uncertain. We analysed individual participant data from randomised trials to investigate the effects of blood pressure lowering treatment on the risk of major cardiovascular events by baseline levels of systolic blood pressure.

Methods

We did a meta-analysis of individual participant-level data from 48 randomised trials of pharmacological blood pressure lowering medications versus placebo or other classes of blood pressure-lowering medications, or between more versus less intensive treatment regimens, which had at least 1000 persons-years of follow-up in each group. Trials exclusively done with participants with heart failure or short-term interventions in participants with acute myocardial infarction or other acute settings were excluded. Data from 51 studies published between 1972 and 2013 were obtained by the Blood Pressure Lowering Treatment Trialists' Collaboration (Oxford University, Oxford, UK). We pooled the data to investigate the stratified effects of blood pressure-lowering treatment in participants with and without prevalent cardiovascular disease (ie, any reports of stroke, myocardial infarction, or ischaemic heart disease before randomisation), overall and across seven systolic blood pressure categories (ranging from < 120 to ≥ 170 mm Hg). The primary outcome was a major cardiovascular event (defined as a composite of fatal and non-fatal stroke, fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, or heart failure causing death or requiring admission to hospital), analysed as per intention to treat.

Findings

Data for 344716 participants from 48 randomised clinical trials were available for this analysis. Pre-randomisation mean systolic/diastolic blood pressures were 146/84 mm Hg in participants with previous cardiovascular disease (n = 157728) and 157/89 mm Hg in participants without previous cardiovascular disease (n = 186988). There was substantial spread in participants' blood pressure at baseline, with 31239 (19·8%) of participants with previous cardiovascular disease and 14928 (8·0%) of individuals without previous cardiovascular disease having a systolic blood pressure of less than 130 mm Hg. The relative effects of blood pressure-lowering treatment were proportional to the intensity of systolic blood pressure reduction. After a median 4·15 years' follow-up (Q1-Q3 2·97–4·96), 42324 participants (12·3%) had at least one major cardiovascular event. In participants without previous cardiovascular disease at baseline, the incidence rate for developing a major cardiovascular event per 1000 person-years was 31·9 (95% CI 31·3–32·5) in the comparator group and 25·9 (25·4–26·4) in the intervention group. In participants with previous cardiovascular disease at baseline, the corresponding rates were 39·7 (95% CI 39·0–40·5) and 36·0 (95% CI 35·3–36·7), in the comparator and intervention groups, respectively. Hazard ratios (HR) associated with a reduction of systolic blood pressure by 5 mm Hg for a major cardiovascular event were 0·91, 95% CI 0·89–0·94 for partipants without previous cardiovascular disease and 0·89, 0·86–0·92, for those with previous cardiovascular disease. In stratified analyses, there was no reliable evidence of heterogeneity of treatment effects on major cardiovascular events by baseline cardiovascular disease status or systolic blood pressure categories.

Interpretation

In this large-scale analysis of randomised trials, a 5 mm Hg reduction of systolic blood pressure reduced the risk of major cardiovascular events by about 10%, irrespective of previous diagnoses of cardiovascular disease, and even at normal or high-normal blood pressure values. These findings suggest that a fixed degree of pharmacological blood pressure lowering is similarly effective for primary and secondary prevention of major cardiovascular disease, even at blood pressure levels currently not considered for treatment. Physicians communicating the indication for blood pressure lowering treatment to their patients should emphasise its importance on reducing cardiovascular risk rather than focusing on blood pressure reduction itself.

Acute severe hypertension encompasses a spectrum of severe blood pressure elevations that can progress to end organ damage if left unmanaged. Understanding the presentations of various acute hypertensive scenarios can help guide interventional radiologists in recognizing clinical symptoms, signs, and selecting effective management strategies. The timely administration of antihypertensive agents is critical to prevent the detrimental effects associated with hypertensive emergencies. The preferred approach to achieve optimal blood pressure control and the desired target blood pressure range may vary based on the hypertensive scenario and patient-specific factors.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of adult patients with asymptomatic hypertension in the emergency department [^5cd9dfb1]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2006). Medium credibility.

Blood pressure measurement methods in the emergency department (ED) — "For years, direct intraarterial measurement of blood pressure has been the criterion standard", and "blood pressure determination by the auscultatory method using a mercury sphygmomanometer has been the traditional method of measurement against which other methods are compared". Although "automated oscillometric determination of blood pressure reliably approximates central aortic pressure", device variability is highlighted by "Park et al16 obtained blood pressure measurements from 7,208 school-aged children from 5 to 17 years of age. On average, systolic oscillometric readings were 10 mm Hg higher than systolic readings obtained with the auscultatory method. Diastolic readings obtained with the oscillometric method were on average 5 mm Hg higher than readings obtained with the auscultatory method". Accordingly, "those who oversee equipment purchases should know whether the oscillometric device used in their ED meets the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation standards".

### 2014 evidence-based guideline for the management of… [^b8cf1ba0]. JAMA Network (2014). Excellent credibility.

There is strong evidence to support treating hypertensive persons aged 60 years or older to a BP goal of less than 150/90 mm Hg and hypertensive persons 30 through 59 years of age to a diastolic goal of less than 90 mm Hg; however, there is insufficient evidence in hypertensive persons younger than 60 years for a systolic goal, or in those younger than 30 years for a diastolic goal, so the panel recommends a BP of less than 140/90 mm Hg for those groups based on expert opinion. In the general population aged ≥ 60 years, initiate pharmacologic treatment to lower blood pressure at systolic blood pressure ≥ 150 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mm Hg and treat to a goal SBP < 150 mm Hg and goal DBP < 90 mm Hg.

Recommendation 1 is based on evidence statements 1 through 3 from question 2 in which there is moderate- to high-quality evidence from RCTs that in the general population aged 60 years or older, treating high BP to a goal of lower than 150/90 mm Hg reduces stroke, heart failure, and coronary heart disease. While all panel members agreed that the evidence supporting recommendation 1 is very strong, the panel was unable to reach unanimity on the recommendation of a goal SBP of lower than 150 mm Hg. Some members recommended continuing the JNC 7 SBP goal of lower than 140 mm Hg for individuals older than 60 years based on expert opinion. 12 These members concluded that the evidence was insufficient to raise the SBP target from lower than 140 to lower than 150 mm Hg in high-risk groups, such as black persons, those with CVD including stroke, and those with multiple risk factors.

In further support for a DBP goal of lower than 90 mm Hg, the panel found evidence that there is no benefit in treating patients to a goal of either 80 mm Hg or lower or 85 mm Hg or lower compared with 90 mm Hg or lower based on the HOT trial, in which patients were randomized to these 3 goals without statistically significant differences between treatment groups in the primary or secondary outcomes.
19. Recommendation 5 is based on evidence statements 18–21 from question 2, which address BP goals in adults with both diabetes and hypertension.

### Predicting out-of-office blood pressure in the clinic (PROOF-BP): derivation and validation of a tool to improve the accuracy of blood pressure measurement in clinical practice [^1d9bef0f]. Hypertension (2016). Low credibility.

Comparison With Previous Literature

Many studies have examined the association between patient characteristics and the home–clinic blood pressure difference, noting age, – sex, – and clinic blood pressure level, – along with anxiety, stress, and other factorsas significant independent predictors of white coat or masked hypertension. The findings of the present study were consistent with previous literature, showing age, sex, clinic blood pressure, pulse pressure, and a history of hypertension as significant predictors of the home–clinic blood pressure difference. Interestingly, female sex was not a significant predictor of the white coat effect, although it was included a priori in the final prediction model because this association has been well-defined in the previous literature.

Few studies have suggested a strategy for targeted use of out-of-office blood pressure in routine clinical practice. Myers et aland Godwin et alhave proposed the use of multiple (automated) office blood pressure readings taken using the BpTRU device to identify patients with high normal blood pressure (130/80 to 139/89 mm Hg) who could be referred for ambulatory blood pressure to confirm the presence of masked hypertension. Similarly, Viera et alexamined optimal automated clinic blood pressure levels for referral for out-of-office monitoring in patients with normal clinic pressure for detection of masked hypertension. However, they concluded that using clinic blood pressure alone was not sufficient because of high referral rates, and suggested that a combination of factors including patient characteristics might be more effective at targeting out-of-office blood pressure more efficiently.

### Blood pressure targets in adults with hypertension [^7aa404b6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

This is the first update of this review first published in 2009. When treating elevated blood pressure, doctors usually try to achieve a blood pressure target. That target is the blood pressure value below which the optimal clinical benefit is supposedly obtained. "The lower the better" approach that guided the treatment of elevated blood pressure for many years was challenged during the last decade due to lack of evidence from randomised trials supporting that strategy. For that reason, the standard blood pressure target in clinical practice during the last years has been less than 140/90 mm Hg for the general population of patients with elevated blood pressure. However, new trials published in recent years have reintroduced the idea of trying to achieve lower blood pressure targets. Therefore, it is important to know whether the benefits outweigh harms when attempting to achieve targets lower than the standard target.

Objectives

The primary objective was to determine if lower blood pressure targets (any target less than or equal to 135/85 mm Hg) are associated with reduction in mortality and morbidity as compared with standard blood pressure targets (less than or equal to 140/ 90 mm Hg) for the treatment of patients with chronic arterial hypertension. The secondary objectives were: to determine if there is a change in mean achieved systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP associated with "lower targets" as compared with "standard targets" in patients with chronic arterial hypertension; and to determine if there is a change in withdrawals due to adverse events with "lower targets" as compared with "standard targets", in patients with elevated blood pressure.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomised controlled trials up to May 2019: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, CENTRAL (2019, Issue 4), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work. The searches had no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing patients allocated to lower or to standard blood pressure targets (see above).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors (JAA, VL) independently assessed the included trials and extracted data. Primary outcomes were total mortality; total serious adverse events; myocardial infarction, stroke, congestive heart failure, end stage renal disease, and other serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes were achieved mean SBP and DBP, withdrawals due to adverse effects, and mean number of antihypertensive drugs used. We assessed the risk of bias of each trial using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. MAIN RESULTS: This update includes 11 RCTs involving 38,688 participants with a mean follow-up of 3.7 years. This represents 7 new RCTs compared with the original version. At baseline the mean weighted age was 63.1 years and the mean weighted blood pressure was 155/91 mm Hg. Lower targets do not reduce total mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.86 to 1.05; 11 trials, 38,688 participants; high-certainty evidence) and do not reduce total serious adverse events (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.08; 6 trials, 18,165 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). This means that the benefits of lower targets do not outweigh the harms as compared to standard blood pressure targets. Lower targets may reduce myocardial infarction (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.96; 6 trials, 18,938 participants, absolute risk reduction (ARR) 0.4%, number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) 250 over 3.7 years) and congestive heart failure (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.92; 5 trials, 15,859 participants, ARR 0.6%, NNTB 167 over 3.7 years) (low-certainty for both outcomes). Reduction in myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure was not reflected in total serious adverse events. This may be due to an increase in other serious adverse events (RR 1.44, 95% CI 1.32 to 1.59; 6 trials. 18,938 participants, absolute risk increase (ARI) 3%, number needed to treat to harm (NNTH) 33 over four years) (low-certainty evidence). Participants assigned to a "lower" target received one additional antihypertensive medication and achieved a significantly lower mean SBP (122.8 mm Hg versus 135.0 mm Hg, and a lower mean DBP (82.0 mm Hg versus 85.2 mm Hg, than those assigned to "standard target".

Authors' Conclusions

For the general population of persons with elevated blood pressure, the benefits of trying to achieve a lower blood pressure target rather than a standard target (≤ 140/90 mm Hg) do not outweigh the harms associated with that intervention. Further research is needed to see if some groups of patients would benefit or be harmed by lower targets. The results of this review are primarily applicable to older people with moderate to high cardiovascular risk. They may not be applicable to other populations.

Control of blood pressure still relies on conventional office or clinical blood pressure measurement using mercury sphygmomanometry. However, it has long been known that office measurement, even when repeated, does not fully reflect usual blood pressure. The additional use of ambulatory devices for prolonged periods of blood pressure measurement is now clinically feasible. Previous research has indicated that ambulatory blood pressure measurement is better than office measurement at predicting individual cardiovascular risk. Guidelines for clinical use of ambulatory blood pressure measurement and for quality control of devices are available. Ambulatory measurement has revealed characteristics of circadian rhythm and variability that are promising with regard both to improving our understanding of the aetiology of high blood pressure and to individual risk assessment. Some of the latest developments in research on ambulatory blood pressure measurement are discussed.

### Screening for hypertension in adults: US preventive services task force reaffirmation recommendation statement [^c2b261e2]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF rationale — Initial 1-time screening with office blood pressure measurement has adequate specificity but low sensitivity for detecting hypertension, and the USPSTF found adequate evidence that an initial positive screening result can be confirmed by home-based blood pressure measurement or ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. The USPSTF found convincing evidence that screening for hypertension with office blood pressure measurement and treatment of hypertension in adults substantially reduce the incidence of cardiovascular events. The USPSTF found convincing evidence that screening for and treatment of hypertension detected in clinical office settings have few major harms. Using a reaffirmation deliberation process, the USPSTF concludes with high certainty that screening for hypertension in adults has substantial net benefit.

### Minimizing catecholamines and optimizing perfusion [^ad4aca84]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Which targets?

The targets of resuscitation include perfusion pressure and various indices of tissue hypoperfusion.

What is the optimal blood pressure target? Varpula et al. first demonstrated in 111 patients with septic shock that the time spent with MAP below 65 mmHg was associated with a worse outcome. Several trials not only confirmed this finding, but even further expanded this reporting that MAP threshold levels lower than 65 were associated with even more severe outcomes. Interestingly, mortality already increases with shorter periods of time when thresholds of MAP lower than 65 mmHg are considered compared to the 65 mmHg threshold. On the contrary, there was no association between mortality and time spent with below MAP thresholds 80–85 mmHg (but above 65 mmHg). Altogether, these observational studies support a MAP threshold around 65 mmHg for the majority of the patients.

However, the optimal MAP threshold may require some individualization. In a series of patients with sepsis but without clinical signs of hypoperfusion, a MAP between 55 and 65 mmHg was well tolerated. In an interventional trial evaluating a MAP threshold of 65–70 versus 80–85 mmHg, no differences in survival were observed. In the subgroup of patients previously hypertensive, the higher MAP target was associated with a reduction in acute kidney injury. However, there was also a significant increase in arrhythmic events and a trend toward an increase in acute myocardial infarction. This trial had two major limitations. First, MAP was much higher than the predefined target value in the lower threshold group so that the safety of MAP 65 was not really evaluated. Second, the trial attributed patients to one group or the other without considering the response to therapy. Interestingly, different MAP targets had variable effects on various indices of tissue hypoperfusion and organ function in several small size interventional studies. Hence, the recommendations of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines to initially target MAP of 65 mmHg remain valid. In selected patients, a higher MAP may be considered, but the effects of increasing MAP above 65 mmHg should be carefully evaluated and returning to lower MAP thresholds should be considered if the patient does not respond to this MAP challenge.

### Assessment of the white-coat effect among hypertensive patients presumed to be at goal [^e834e1e7]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2011). Low credibility.

Background

There are limited studies that explore the rate of existent uncontrolled hypertension versus a significant white-coat effect. Likewise, few studies have described the physician's response to the results of an ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) study.

Objective

To determine the percentage of treated hypertensive patients referred for ABPM based on discrepant office and home blood pressures who had achieved goal blood pressure and to determine the degree of white-coat effect in these patients.

Methods

Medical records of 222 consecutive patients were reviewed. Patients without a clinic visit since a medication change and those with < 70% valid readings on ABPM were excluded. The proportion of patients at their goal blood pressure during ABPM was determined. Clinic blood pressure readings prior to ABPM were compared to daytime ABPM readings to calculate the white-coat effect. The percentage of patients whose blood pressure decreased by 10% or more in the night interval versus the daytime period was calculated. Changes to antihypertensive therapy were determined for the 6-month post-ABPM period.

Results

One hundred ninety-three patients met the inclusion criteria. Mean (SD) clinic blood pressure was 158/77 (13/10) mm Hg, compared to mean daytime ABPM readings of 127/70 (12/9) mm Hg. Sixty-seven percent of patients were at goal blood pressure. The mean white-coat effect was 31/7 (16/9) mmHg and was significantly greater in patients who were at goal versus those who were not (p < 0.01). A 10% or higher overnight dip occurred in 28% of those at goal. Therapy was not escalated 6 months after ABPM in 91% of patients who were at goal during the test despite a mean post-ABPM clinic blood pressure of 151/74 mm Hg.

Conclusions

The majority of patients with incongruent clinic and home blood pressure readings were at goal after ABPM evaluation. Further study is needed regarding demographic or clinical characteristics that can be used to help predict which patients may be experiencing a significant white-coat effect and are actually at goal in an ambulatory setting.

### Pragmatic method using blood pressure diaries to assess blood pressure control [^d862dad3]. Annals of Family Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

Twenty-four-hour ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) is the reference standard of blood pressure control. Home blood pressure (HBP) is superior to clinic blood pressure for assessing control, but a barrier to its use is the need for physicians to calculate average blood pressure from patient diaries. We sought to develop a quick and pragmatic method to assess blood pressure control from patients' HBP diaries.

Methods

Seven-day HBP and 24-hour ABP were measured in 286 patients with uncomplicated treated hypertension (aged 64 ± 8 years; 53% female). We determined the optimal ratio of home systolic blood pressure readings above threshold (≥ 135 mm Hg) for the last 10 recorded that would best predict elevated 24-hour ABP. Uncontrolled blood pressure was defined as 24-hour ABP systolic blood pressure ≥ 130 mm Hg or 24-hour ABP daytime systolic blood pressure ≥ 135 mm Hg. Validation by corroborative evidence was tested by association with markers of end-organ disease.

Results

The best predictor of 24-hour ABP systolic blood pressure above treatment/target threshold was having 3 or more (≥ 30%) of the last 10 home systolic blood pressure readings ≥ 135 mm Hg (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.71). Importantly, patients meeting this criterion had evidence of target organ disease, with significantly higher aortic stiffness, left ventricular relative wall thickness, and left atrial area, and lower left ventricular ejection fraction, compared with those who did not meet this criterion.

Conclusions

To facilitate uptake of HBP monitoring, we propose that physicians can determine the percentage of the last 10 home systolic blood pressure values ≥ 135 mm Hg for a patient and tailor management accordingly.

### Screening for hypertension in adults: US preventive services task force reaffirmation recommendation statement [^1e589ebf]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for hypertension, more specifically with respect to indications for screening, adults, USPSTF 2021 guidelines recommend to obtain screening for HTN with office BP measurement in ≥ 18 years old adults. Obtain BP measurements outside the clinical setting for diagnostic confirmation before initiating treatment.

### A comparison of the diagnostic accuracy of common office blood pressure measurement protocols [^3fd37191]. American Journal of Hypertension (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The optimal approach to measuring office blood pressure (BP) is uncertain. We aimed to compare BP measurement protocols that differed based on numbers of readings within and between visits and by assessment method.

Methods

We enrolled a sample of 707 employees without known hypertension or cardiovascular disease, and obtained 6 standardized BP readings during each of 3 office visits at least 1 week apart, using mercury sphygmomanometer and BpTRU oscillometric devices (18 readings per participant) for a total of 12,645 readings. We used confirmatory factor analysis to develop a model estimating "true" office BP that could be used to compare the probability of correctly classifying participants' office BP status using differing numbers and types of office BP readings.

Results

Averaging 2 systolic BP readings across 2 visits correctly classified participants as having BP below or above the 140 mm Hg threshold at least 95% of the time if the averaged reading was < 134 or > 149 mm Hg, respectively. Our model demonstrated that more confidence was gained by increasing the number of visits with readings than by increasing the number of readings within a visit. No clinically significant confidence was gained by dropping the first reading vs. averaging all readings, nor by measuring with a manual mercury device vs. with an automated oscillometric device.

Conclusions

Averaging 2 BP readings across 2 office visits appeared to best balance increased confidence in office BP status with efficiency of BP measurement, though the preferred measurement strategy may vary with the clinical context.

### Personalized blood pressure targets in shock: what If your normal blood pressure is "Low"? [^60d7b1be]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

The cornerstone of resuscitation of septic shock is volume infusion followed by vasopressors if fluid volume does not restore adequate perfusion. Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines recommend an initial target mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 65 mm Hg, subsequently adjusted. The target MAP and the relative proportions of use of volume versus vasopressors varies widely. But there remains the overarching large question of how to personalize a MAP target in shock (Figure 1).

Figure 1.
At present, the target resuscitation mean arterial pressure (MAP) is 65 mm Hg, despite patients having premorbid blood pressures ranging from hypertension to normal-to-low blood pressure. The goal now is to personalize the initial MAP target according to premorbid blood pressure, aiming for 80–85 mm Hg in patients with previous hypertension; 65 mm Hg in patients with previous normotension; and a lower target, perhaps 55 mm Hg, in patients having a low premorbid blood pressure. In all patients, resuscitation should also aim to achieve normal peripheral perfusion (normal capillary refill time < 2 s, absence of cyanosis), improved mentation (Glasgow Coma Score > 12 mm Hg without sedation), and adequate urine output > 0.5 ml/kg/h.

### Severely increased blood pressure in the emergency department [^26aad94c]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Patients with severely increased blood pressure often present to the emergency department. Emergency physicians evaluate and treat hypertension in various contexts, ranging from the compliant patient with well-controlled blood pressure to the asymptomatic patient with increased blood pressure to the critically ill patient with increased blood pressure and acute target-organ deterioration. Despite extensive study and national guidelines for the assessment and treatment of chronically increased blood pressure, there is no clear consensus on the acute management of patients with severely increased blood pressure. In this article, we examine the broad spectrum of disease, from the asymptomatic to critically ill patient, and the dilemma it creates for the emergency physician in deciding how and when in the process to intervene.

For the second search, inclusion required at least 2000 participants, multicenter design, and meeting other inclusion/exclusion criteria; the relatively high threshold of 2000 participants was used due to lower event rates in recent RCTs. Selected studies were rated using the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) quality tool and included if rated good or fair. The panel crafted evidence statements, recorded agreement votes with a record of vote counts, attempted 100% consensus, accepted a two-thirds majority when needed, and required a 75% majority to approve recommendations based on expert opinion.

Baseline Characteristics

In SPRINT and ACCORD-BP trials, we included 7515 patients (mean [SD] age 65.6 [8.7] years) with 4553 (60.6%) men (Figure 1). Most patients achieved a DBP of between 60 and less than 70 mm Hg (3250 [43.2%]) and between 70 and less than 80 mm Hg (2545 [33.9%]) (Table). Patients who achieved lower DBP were generally older (eg, 60 to < 70 mm Hg vs ≥ 80 mm Hg: mean [SD] age, 66.9 [8.2] years vs 59.0 [5.6] years; P < .001), had lower mean (SD) BMI (eg, 60 to < 70 mm Hg vs ≥ 80 mm Hg: 30.9 [5.7] vs 31.0 [5.9]; P < .001), had lower mean (SD) baseline DBP (eg, 60 to < 70 mm Hg vs ≥ 80 mm Hg: 75.0 [9.0] vs 89.0 [10.3]; P < .001), had higher mean (SD) baseline SBP (eg, 60 to < 70 mm Hg vs ≥ 80 mm Hg: 136.8 [15.1] vs 135.0 [15.1]; P = 0.004), had lower mean (SD) LDL-C levels (eg, 60 to < 70 mm Hg vs ≥ 80 mm Hg: 108.0 [34.9] mg/dL vs 120.7 [38.4] mg/dL [to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0259]; P < .001), had higher mean (SD) glycemic levels (eg, 60 to < 70 mm Hg vs ≥ 80 mm Hg: 129.0 [51.2] mg/dL vs 111.0 [38.4] mg/dL [to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0555]; P < .001), were less likely to currently use tobacco (eg, 60 to < 70 mm Hg vs ≥ 80 mm Hg: 369 [11.4%] vs 121 [25.4%]; P < .001), and more likely to have a history of cardiovascular disease (1509 [46.4%] vs 114 [23.9%]; P < .001).

### Determining which automatic digital blood pressure device performs adequately: a systematic review [^e9ecf6cb]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2010). Low credibility.

However, it is worth noting that the change from mercury to electronic BP measurement in practice has led to no consistent change in mean BP after their introduction, but there was a large and significant fall in terminal digit preference suggesting improved precision of recording with electronic devices.

This study had a number of limitations: the reproducibility of protocol testing is currently unknown. We found no studies, which repeated earlier validations. Some studies may have been missed. Although the search of 5912 potentially relevant records was comprehensive, with analysis of 3356 potentially relevant records, studies in which machines failed the validation are less likely to be published, particularly if the manufacturer is involved in the funding. However, missing such studies would have the effect of worsening the results and hence would not alter the conclusions. All validation studies found used the standard cuff size. A significant proportion of adults will need to use the larger cuff and yet there is no evidence as to whether this will be accurate. The analysis was limited by the lack of reporting of proportional data in some cases. Development of an international consensus on minimal standards of reporting, including representations of proportional data, would go some way to allowing comparison of devices under different validation protocols. Our estimates of the proportion within 5 mm Hg of the observed value may not be accurate, because they assume a study-specific normal distribution that leads to some degree of inaccuracy, but were sufficient to inform the ordering of the figures.

11 ORTHOSTATIC HYPOTENSION (Box 27)

Orthostatic hypotension is a common condition associated with adverse cardiovascular prognosis. Screening for orthostatic hypotension consists of BP measurements in supine (or sitting) and standing position during clinical consultations. However, orthostatic hypotension is poorly reproducible; thus assessments carried out at the doctors' office are likely to underestimate its true prevalence. HBPM can improve orthostatic hypotension diagnosis without compromising the quality of the postural BP assessment, as shown by Cremer et al. who demonstrated that in 505 mostly hypertensive patients, orthostatic hypotension prevalence defined as the presence of one episode of orthostatic hypotension detected by HBPM was 37.5%, much higher than orthostatic hypotension prevalence measured in the same cohort in a clinic setting (15%). Orthostatic hypotension is a common finding in elderly patients because of their impaired baroreceptor sensitivity, and is often associated with hypertension, dementia, other neurodegenerative diseases (e.g. Parkinson's disease), atrial fibrillation, diabetes and heart failure. However, in the elderly individuals, it may be difficult to use HBPM because of physical and/or cognitive dysfunction of the users. The diagnostic accuracy of HBPM in detecting orthostatic hypotension as compared with ABPM needs to be explored. The potential usefulness of wearable devices for self BPM in detecting orthostatic hypotension requires to be investigated.

### Blood pressure targets for the treatment of people with hypertension and cardiovascular disease [^c202a50b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

This is the third update of the review first published in 2017. Hypertension is a prominent preventable cause of premature morbidity and mortality. People with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease are at particularly high risk, so reducing blood pressure to below standard targets may be beneficial. This strategy could reduce cardiovascular mortality and morbidity but could also increase adverse events. The optimal blood pressure target in people with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease remains unknown.

Objectives

To determine if lower blood pressure targets (systolic/diastolic 135/85 mmHg or less) are associated with reduction in mortality and morbidity compared with standard blood pressure targets (140 mmHg to 160mmHg/90 mmHg to 100 mmHg or less) in the treatment of people with hypertension and a history of cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, angina, stroke, peripheral vascular occlusive disease).

Search Methods

For this updated review, we used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was January 2022. We applied no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with more than 50 participants per group that provided at least six months' follow-up. Trial reports had to present data for at least one primary outcome (total mortality, serious adverse events, total cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality). Eligible interventions involved lower targets for systolic/diastolic blood pressure (135/85 mmHg or less) compared with standard targets for blood pressure (140 mmHg to 160 mmHg/90 mmHg to 100 mmHg or less). Participants were adults with documented hypertension and adults receiving treatment for hypertension with a cardiovascular history for myocardial infarction, stroke, chronic peripheral vascular occlusive disease, or angina pectoris.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence.

Main Results

We included seven RCTs that involved 9595 participants. Mean follow-up was 3.7 years (range 1.0 to 4.7 years). Six of seven RCTs provided individual participant data. None of the included studies was blinded to participants or clinicians because of the need to titrate antihypertensive drugs to reach a specific blood pressure goal. However, an independent committee blinded to group allocation assessed clinical events in all trials. Hence, we assessed all trials at high risk of performance bias and low risk of detection bias. We also considered other issues, such as early termination of studies and subgroups of participants not predefined, to downgrade the certainty of the evidence. We found there is probably little to no difference in total mortality (risk ratio (RR) 1.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91 to 1.23; 7 studies, 9595 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) or cardiovascular mortality (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.29; 6 studies, 9484 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Similarly, we found there may be little to no differences in serious adverse events (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.08; 7 studies, 9595 participants; low-certainty evidence) or total cardiovascular events (including myocardial infarction, stroke, sudden death, hospitalization, or death from congestive heart failure (CHF)) (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.00; 7 studies, 9595 participants; low-certainty evidence). The evidence was very uncertain about withdrawals due to adverse effects. However, studies suggest more participants may withdraw due to adverse effects in the lower target group (RR 8.16, 95% CI 2.06 to 32.28; 3 studies, 801 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Systolic and diastolic blood pressure readings were lower in the lower target group (systolic: mean difference (MD) -8.77 mmHg, 95% CI -12.82 to -4.73; 7 studies, 8657 participants; diastolic: MD -4.50 mmHg, 95% CI -6.35 to -2.65; 6 studies, 8546 participants). More drugs were needed in the lower target group (MD 0.56, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.96; 5 studies, 7910 participants), but blood pressure targets at one year were achieved more frequently in the standard target group (RR 1.20, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.23; 7 studies, 8699 participants).

Authors' Conclusions

We found there is probably little to no difference in total mortality and cardiovascular mortality between people with hypertension and cardiovascular disease treated to a lower compared to a standard blood pressure target. There may also be little to no difference in serious adverse events or total cardiovascular events. This suggests that no net health benefit is derived from a lower systolic blood pressure target. We found very limited evidence on withdrawals due to adverse effects, which led to high uncertainty. At present, evidence is insufficient to justify lower blood pressure targets (135/85 mmHg or less) in people with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease. Several trials are still ongoing, which may provide an important input to this topic in the near future.

Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Benefits of treating higher versus lower BP targets in older adults indicate that across all trials treating high BP in older adults was beneficial, but most evidence came from patients with moderate or severe hypertension (SBP > 160 mm Hg) at baseline who with treatment achieved SBP targets greater than 140 mm Hg; among those with baseline SBP of 160 mm Hg or greater who achieved a target SBP less than 150 mm Hg, moderate-quality evidence showed a reduction in all-cause mortality, although not quite statistically significant (relative risk [RR], 0.93 [95% CI, 0.85 to 1.00]; absolute risk reduction [ARR], 1.13), with high-quality evidence showing reductions in stroke (RR, 0.77 [CI, 0.64 to 0.91]; ARR, 0.92) and cardiac events (RR, 0.83 [CI, 0.71 to 0.96]; ARR, 0.72); in studies with lower SBP targets (< 140 mm Hg), low-quality evidence showed no statistically significant reduction in all-cause mortality (RR, 0.93 [CI, 0.75 to 1.14]; ARR, 0.21), cardiac events (RR, 0.91 [CI, 0.77 to 1.08]; ARR, 0.35), or stroke (RR, 0.86 [CI, 0.64 to 1.01]; ARR, 0.19) compared with higher BP targets, noting many studies did not achieve the targeted BP and had little difference between intensive treatment and control groups.

### Blood pressure targets for hypertension in people with diabetes mellitus [^507cc520]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

When treating elevated blood pressure (BP), doctors often want to know what blood pressure target they should try to achieve. The standard blood pressure target in clinical practice for some time has been less than 140–160/90–100 mmHg for the general population of people with elevated blood pressure. Several clinical guidelines published in recent years have recommended lower targets (less than 130/80 mmHg) for people with diabetes mellitus. It is not known whether attempting to achieve targets lower than the standard target reduces mortality and morbidity in those with elevated blood pressure and diabetes.

Objectives

To determine if 'lower' BP targets (any target less than 130/85 mmHg) are associated with reduction in mortality and morbidity compared with 'standard' BP targets (less than 140–160/90–100 mmHg) in people with diabetes.

Search Methods

We searched the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE) and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for related reviews. We conducted electronic searches of the Hypertension Group Specialised Register (January 1946 - October 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2013, Issue 9), MEDLINE (January 1946 - October 2013), EMBASE (January 1974 - October 2013) and ClinicalTrials.gov. The most recent search was performed on October 4, 2013. Other search sources were the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP), and reference lists of all papers and relevant reviews.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials comparing people with diabetes randomized to lower or to standard BP targets as previously defined, and providing data on any of the primary outcomes below.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed and established the included trials and data entry. Primary outcomes were total mortality; total serious adverse events; myocardial infarction, stroke, congestive heart failure and end-stage renal disease. Secondary outcomes were achieved mean systolic and diastolic BP, and withdrawals due to adverse effects.

Main Results

We found five randomized trials, recruiting a total of 7314 participants and with a mean follow-up of 4.5 years. Only one trial (ACCORD) compared outcomes associated with 'lower' (< 120 mmHg) or 'standard' (< 140 mmHg) systolic blood pressure targets in 4734 participants. Despite achieving a significantly lower BP (119.3/64.4 mmHg vs 133.5/70.5 mmHg, P < 0.0001), and using more antihypertensive medications, the only significant benefit in the group assigned to 'lower' systolic blood pressure (SBP) was a reduction in the incidence of stroke: risk ratio (RR) 0.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.39 to 0.88, P = 0.009, absolute risk reduction 1.1%. The effect of SBP targets on mortality was compatible with both a reduction and increase in risk: RR 1.05 CI 0.84 to 1.30, low quality evidence. Trying to achieve the 'lower' SBP target was associated with a significant increase in the number of other serious adverse events: RR 2.58, 95% CI 1.70 to 3.91, P < 0.00001, absolute risk increase 2.0%. Four trials (ABCD-H, ABCD-N, ABCD-2V, and a subgroup of HOT) specifically compared clinical outcomes associated with 'lower' versus 'standard' targets for diastolic blood pressure (DBP) in people with diabetes. The total number of participants included in the DBP target analysis was 2580. Participants assigned to 'lower' DBP had a significantly lower achieved BP: 128/76 mmHg vs 135/83 mmHg, P < 0.0001. There was a trend towards reduction in total mortality in the group assigned to the 'lower' DBP target (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.01), mainly due to a trend to lower non-cardiovascular mortality. There was no difference in stroke (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.05), in myocardial infarction (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.40) or in congestive heart failure (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.92), low quality evidence. End-stage renal failure and total serious adverse events were not reported in any of the trials. A sensitivity analysis of trials comparing DBP targets < 80 mmHg (as suggested in clinical guidelines) versus < 90 mmHg showed similar results. There was a high risk of selection bias for every outcome analyzed in favor of the 'lower' target in the trials included for the analysis of DBP targets.

Authors' Conclusions

At the present time, evidence from randomized trials does not support blood pressure targets lower than the standard targets in people with elevated blood pressure and diabetes. More randomized controlled trials are needed, with future trials reporting total mortality, total serious adverse events as well as cardiovascular and renal events.

Recommendation 2: ACP and AAFP recommend that clinicians consider initiating or intensifying pharmacologic treatment in adults aged 60 years or older with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack to achieve a target systolic blood pressure of less than 140 mm Hg to reduce the risk for recurrent stroke (Grade: weak recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). Recommendation 3: ACP and AAFP recommend that clinicians consider initiating or intensifying pharmacologic treatment in adults aged 60 years or older at high cardiovascular risk, based on individualized assessment, to achieve a target systolic blood pressure of less than 140 mm Hg (Grade: weak recommendation, low-quality evidence); ACP and AAFP recommend that clinicians select the treatment goals for adults aged 60 years or older based on a periodic discussion of the benefits and harms of specific blood pressure targets with the patient.

Furthermore, existing guidelines provide few recommendations as to the management of those with markedly elevated BP absent a hypertensive emergency, leading to questions on who warrants diagnostic testing to look for end-organ injury, how much acute pain or anxiety may contribute to BP in the ED, when initiation or titration of antihypertensive medications is indicated, or how to manage patients with no reliable outpatient follow-up. Emergency clinicians continue to use outdated and incorrect diagnoses such as "hypertension urgency", a term that implies the need for "something" to be done in the ED setting, despite lack of sound basis in the literature, including current international guidelines.

### Pharmacologic treatment of hypertension in adults aged 60 years or older to higher versus lower blood pressure targets: a clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians and the American Academy of Family Physicians [^32b8626d]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Description

The American College of Physicians (ACP) and the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) jointly developed this guideline to present the evidence and provide clinical recommendations based on the benefits and harms of higher versus lower blood pressure targets for the treatment of hypertension in adults aged 60 years or older.

Methods

This guideline is based on a systematic review of published randomized, controlled trials for primary outcomes and observational studies for harms only (identified through EMBASE, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, MEDLINE, and ClinicalTrials.gov), from database inception through January 2015. The MEDLINE search was updated through September 2016. Evaluated outcomes included all-cause mortality, morbidity and mortality related to stroke, major cardiac events (fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death), and harms. This guideline grades the evidence and recommendations using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) method.

Target Audience and Patient Population

The target audience for this guideline includes all clinicians, and the target patient population includes all adults aged 60 years or older with hypertension.

Recommendation 1

ACP and AAFP recommend that clinicians initiate treatment in adults aged 60 years or older with systolic blood pressure persistently at or above 150 mm Hg to achieve a target systolic blood pressure of less than 150 mm Hg to reduce the risk for mortality, stroke, and cardiac events. (Grade: strong recommendation, high-quality evidence). ACP and AAFP recommend that clinicians select the treatment goals for adults aged 60 years or older based on a periodic discussion of the benefits and harms of specific blood pressure targets with the patient.

Recommendation 2

ACP and AAFP recommend that clinicians consider initiating or intensifying pharmacologic treatment in adults aged 60 years or older with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack to achieve a target systolic blood pressure of less than 140 mm Hg to reduce the risk for recurrent stroke. (Grade: weak recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). ACP and AAFP recommend that clinicians select the treatment goals for adults aged 60 years or older based on a periodic discussion of the benefits and harms of specific blood pressure targets with the patient.

Recommendation 3

ACP and AAFP recommend that clinicians consider initiating or intensifying pharmacologic treatment in some adults aged 60 years or older at high cardiovascular risk, based on individualized assessment, to achieve a target systolic blood pressure of less than 140 mm Hg to reduce the risk for stroke or cardiac events. (Grade: weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). ACP and AAFP recommend that clinicians select the treatment goals for adults aged 60 years or older based on a periodic discussion of the benefits and harms of specific blood pressure targets with the patient.

### KDIGO 2021 clinical practice guideline for the management of blood pressure in chronic kidney Disease [^e7f5bd33]. Kidney International (2021). High credibility.

Blood pressure targets in CKD not receiving dialysis — standardized office measurement: We suggest that adults with high BP and CKD be treated with a target systolic blood pressure (SBP) of < 120 mm Hg, when tolerated, using standardized office BP measurement (2B). It is potentially hazardous to apply the recommended SBP target of < 120 mm Hg to BP measurements obtained in a non-standardized manner, and clinicians can reasonably offer less intensive BP-lowering therapy in patients with very limited life expectancy or symptomatic postural hypotension.

### Analysis of late risk of systemic blood pressures [^5e10d687]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

We studied categories of blood pressure (BP) < 120/80 mm Hg as predictors of hypertension 10 to 22 years later by logistic regression analyses with 6 covariates. There was progressively increased risk for subjects with systolic BP 100 to 109 and 110 to 119 mm Hg (vs < 100 mm Hg) or diastolic BP 70 to 74 and 75 to 79 mm Hg (vs < 70 mm Hg). These relations were similar in men, women, and several ethnic groups but stronger in subjects < 40 years old. These data suggest a definition of optimal BP of < 100/70 mm Hg, similar to usual BP levels in children < 10 years old.

Background

This is an update of the original Cochrane review, published in 2017. Eight out of 10 major antihypertensive trials in adults, 65 years of age or older, attempted to achieve a target systolic blood pressure (BP) of < 160 mmHg. Collectively, these trials demonstrated cardiovascular benefit for treatment, compared to no treatment, for older adults with BP > 160 mmHg. However, an even lower BP target of < 140 mmHg is commonly applied to all age groups. Yet the risk and benefit of antihypertensive therapy can be expected to vary across populations, and some observational evidence suggests that older adults who are frail might have better health outcomes with less aggressive BP lowering. Current clinical practice guidelines are inconsistent in target BP recommendations for older adults, with systolic BP targets ranging from < 130 mmHg to < 150 mmHg. The 2017 review did not find compelling evidence of a reduction in any of the primary outcomes, including all-cause mortality, stroke, or total serious cardiovascular adverse events, comparing a lower BP target to a higher BP target in older adults with hypertension. It is important to update this review to explore if new evidence exists to determine whether older adults might do just as well, better, or worse with less aggressive pharmacotherapy for hypertension.

Objectives

To assess the effects of a less aggressive blood pressure target (in the range of < 150 to 160/95 to 105 mmHg), compared to a conventional or more aggressive BP target (of < 140/90 mmHg or lower) in hypertensive adults, 65 years of age or older.

Search Methods

For this update, Cochrane Hypertension's Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomised controlled trials up to June 2024: Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE Ovid, and Embase Ovid, and the US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register ClinicalTrials.gov for ongoing trials. We also contacted authors of relevant papers requesting information on further published and unpublished work. The searches had no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised trials of hypertensive older adults (≥ 65 years) that spanned at least one year, and reported the effect on mortality and morbidity of a higher or lower systolic or diastolic BP treatment target. Higher BP targets ranged from systolic BP < 150 to 160 mmHg or diastolic BP < 95 to 105 mmHg; lower BP targets were 140/90 mmHg or lower, measured in an ambulatory, home, or office setting.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently screened and selected trials for inclusion, assessed risk of bias and certainty of the evidence, and extracted data. We combined data for dichotomous outcomes using the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). For continuous outcomes, we used mean difference (MD). Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, stroke, institutionalisation, and serious cardio-renal vascular adverse events. Secondary outcomes included cardiovascular mortality, non-cardiovascular mortality, unplanned hospitalisation, each component of cardiovascular serious adverse events separately (including cerebrovascular disease, cardiac disease, vascular disease, and renal failure), total serious adverse events, total minor adverse events, withdrawals due to adverse effects, systolic BP achieved, and diastolic BP achieved.

Main Results

With the addition of one new trial, we included four trials in this updated review (16,732 older adults with a mean age of 70.3 years). Of these, one trial used a combined systolic and diastolic BP target and compared a higher target of < 150/90 mmHg to a lower target of < 140/90 mmHg, and two trials utilised a purely systolic BP target, and compared a systolic BP < 150 mmHg (1 trial) and a systolic BP < 160 mmHg (1 trial), to a systolic BP < 140 mmHg. The fourth and newest trial also utilised a systolic BP target, but also introduced a lower limit for systolic BP. It compared systolic BP in the target range of 130 to 150 mmHg to a lower target range of 110 to 130 mmHg. The evidence shows that treatment to the lower BP target over two to four years may result in little to no difference in all-cause mortality (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.37; 4 studies, 16,732 participants; low-certainty evidence), but the lower BP target does reduce stroke (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.67; 4 studies, 16,732 participants; high-certainty evidence), and likely reduces total serious cardiovascular adverse events (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.45; 4 studies, 16,732 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Adverse effects were not available from all trials, but the lower BP target likely does not increase withdrawals due to adverse effects (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.33; 3 studies, 16,008 participants; moderate-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

When comparing a higher BP target, in the range of < 150 to 160/95 to 105 mmHg, to a lower BP target of 140/90 or lower, over two to four years of follow-up, there is high-certainty evidence that the lower BP target reduces stroke, and moderate-certainty evidence that the lower BP target likely reduces serious cardiovascular events. The effect on all-cause mortality is unclear (low-certainty evidence), and the lower BP target likely does not increase withdrawals due to adverse effects (moderate-certainty evidence). Although additional research is warranted in those who are 80 years of age and older, and those who are frail (in whom risks and benefits may differ), conventional BP targets may be appropriate for the majority of older adults.
