## Question

What is bradycardia?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what bradycardia is. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core definition and numeric thresholds. Then, I should verify how different sources frame the threshold and why. Next, I will classify the major etiologic categories and their clinical implications. After that, I need to distinguish physiologic from pathologic bradycardia and define what makes bradycardia "symptomatic". Finally, I will integrate guideline-based diagnostic principles and synthesize a concise, clinically useful definition with caveats and exceptions.

> Let me first confirm the basic definition. Bradycardia is generally defined as a heart rate less than 60 beats per minute in adults, and this threshold is widely used in clinical practice and emergency care contexts, including the ED literature and many population studies, even though some analyses and guidelines prefer a lower cutoff in certain contexts [^1136K8VL].

> Wait, let me verify the rationale for alternative thresholds. The ACC/AHA/HRS guideline notes that while the NIH defines bradycardia as less than 60 bpm, population studies frequently use less than 50 bpm, and in sinus node dysfunction constructs within the guideline, a sinus rate less than 50 bpm is often highlighted as a potential component of disease, though heart rate alone should not dictate treatment without symptoms or corroborating findings [^1136K8VL] [^113vYVMg].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about what constitutes "normal". I need to check physiologic versus pathologic contexts. In well-trained athletes, resting sinus bradycardia is common and benign, and in healthy older adults, brief sinus pauses up to about 2–3 seconds can occur without disease, so absolute thresholds must be interpreted in clinical context and, critically, in relation to symptoms and hemodynamics [^1136K8VL] [^113vYVMg].

> Next, I should review the major etiologic categories. Bradycardia can be broadly classified into sinus node dysfunction, atrioventricular block, and conduction disorders with 1:1 AV conduction such as bundle branch or fascicular block; clinically, the first two categories are most often implicated when bradycardia is symptomatic or requires intervention, whereas isolated bundle branch block without AV block is typically not causal for bradycardia symptoms on its own [^113X3qVz] [^113tiDpV].

> I will now examine sinus node dysfunction more closely. SND includes sinus bradycardia, sinoatrial exit block, sinus pauses or arrest, chronotropic incompetence, and tachy-brady syndrome; the guideline emphasizes that a sinus rate less than 50 bpm and/or sinus pauses greater than 3 seconds are potential components of SND, but these findings alone should not be used to diagnose SND or to justify treatment without correlating symptoms [^114WyHRN] [^116bmw25] [^113vYVMg].

> Let me consider atrioventricular block next. AV block spans first-degree (PR greater than 200 ms with 1:1 conduction), second-degree (Mobitz I with progressive PR prolongation and dropped beats, Mobitz II with constant PR and dropped beats, and 2:1 block), advanced or high-grade block with multiple nonconducted P waves, and third-degree or complete AV block with no atrioventricular conduction; these entities are defined by ECG patterns and carry different prognostic and pacing implications, particularly when symptoms are present or when there is evidence of infranodal disease [^1163YhRa] [^114wmuEn].

> But wait, what if the bradycardia is "symptomatic"? I should confirm the definition. Symptomatic bradycardia is a documented bradyarrhythmia directly responsible for syncope or presyncope, dizziness or lightheadedness, heart failure symptoms, or confusional states from cerebral hypoperfusion attributable to slow heart rate; direct attribution can be challenging because nonspecific symptoms like fatigue are multifactorial, so correlation with rhythm documentation is essential before labeling symptoms as bradycardia-related [^111S3gZT].

> Next, I should review diagnostic principles that shape how we interpret bradycardia. The initial evaluation should include a focused history and physical, a 12-lead ECG to document rhythm, rate, and conduction, and targeted labs; ambulatory ECG monitoring is used to correlate symptoms with rhythm, and exercise testing helps assess chronotropic competence; importantly, an abnormal ECG increases risk in syncope even if it does not immediately yield a bradyarrhythmic diagnosis, reinforcing the need for structured evaluation rather than relying on a single resting ECG [^111vmBAN] [^114Pk5rj] [^113C12vC] [^112grHKF].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of thresholds in decision-making. The guideline's shift away from device-first thinking underscores that treatment decisions should not be based on heart rate cutoffs alone; instead, management hinges on correlating symptoms with documented bradyarrhythmia, identifying reversible causes, and applying shared decision-making when pacing is considered, especially in patients with comorbidities or limited life expectancy where benefit may be uncertain [^1172pub7] [^114MdUZW] [^1141nbG9].

> Let me synthesize a clinically useful definition, but I need to ensure I preserve the nuances. Bradycardia is a heart rate less than 60 bpm in adults, with the caveat that population studies and some guideline frameworks often consider less than 50 bpm more specific for pathologic bradycardia; it may reflect physiologic adaptation, particularly in athletes, or pathologic processes involving the sinus node, AV node, or His-Purkinje system; clinically significant bradycardia is best framed as a documented bradyarrhythmia that correlates with symptoms attributable to cerebral or systemic hypoperfusion, recognizing that correlation is the diagnostic gold standard and that treatment decisions should be symptom-driven rather than rate-driven [^1136K8VL] [^112uPC4B] [^1131UeWv].

Bradycardia is a **heart rate below 60 bpm** in adults, with **symptomatic bradycardia** defined by symptoms attributable to slow heart rate, such as syncope, presyncope, dizziness, fatigue, or dyspnea [^112uPC4B]. It can be physiologic in athletes or during sleep, or pathologic due to sinus node dysfunction, atrioventricular block, or drug effects [^113X3qVz]. Evaluation includes a 12-lead ECG [^113HSWBH], ambulatory monitoring [^113C12vC], and targeted labs; management focuses on correcting reversible causes [^115BF9jR], and pacing is indicated for persistent symptomatic bradycardia or high-grade AV block [^1152vSmo].

---

## Definition and classification

- **Definition**: Bradycardia is a heart rate < 60 bpm in adults [^116uzyy5]; population studies often use < 50 bpm to define sinus node dysfunction [^1136KHnM].
- **Physiologic bradycardia**: Common in athletes, during sleep, or with increased vagal tone [^1136KHnM].
- **Pathologic bradycardia**: Due to intrinsic conduction system disease or extrinsic factors (e.g. drugs, hypothyroidism, electrolyte disturbances) [^115hNuzz].

---

## Clinical manifestations

Symptoms vary with severity and underlying cause; **common symptoms** include:

- Syncope or presyncope
- Dizziness or lightheadedness
- Fatigue or reduced exercise tolerance
- Dyspnea or chest discomfort
- Confusion or cognitive impairment

---

## Etiology

Bradycardia arises from **intrinsic conduction system disease** or **extrinsic factors**:

| **Intrinsic causes** | **Extrinsic causes** |
|-|-|
| Sinus node dysfunction (SND) [^113X3qVz] | Medications (beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, digoxin, antiarrhythmics) [^115BF9jR] |
| Atrioventricular block (first-, second-, third-degree) [^1163YhRa] | Electrolyte disturbances (hyperkalemia, hypokalemia) [^notfound] |
| Bundle branch block/fascicular block [^113tiDpV] | Hypothyroidism [^notfound] |
| Infiltrative diseases (amyloidosis, sarcoidosis) [^115hNuzz] | Increased vagal tone (vasovagal syncope) [^113X3qVz] |
| Ischemic heart disease [^115hNuzz] | Sleep apnea [^notfound] |

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

A **structured approach** is essential:

- **History and physical examination**: Identify symptoms, triggers, medications, and comorbidities [^111vmBAN].
- **12-lead ECG**: Document rhythm, rate, conduction, and structural clues [^113HSWBH].
- **Ambulatory ECG monitoring**: Correlate symptoms with rhythm; Holter for frequent events, event/implantable monitors for infrequent symptoms [^113C12vC].
- **Laboratory tests**: TSH, electrolytes, troponin if ischemia suspected [^notfound].
- **Exercise testing**: Assess chronotropic competence [^114Pk5rj].
- **Echocardiography**: Evaluate structural heart disease [^115npB4d].

---

## Management

Management depends on **symptom severity**, **underlying cause**, and **reversibility**:

- **Reversible causes**: Treat hypothyroidism, correct electrolytes, stop offending drugs [^115BF9jR].
- **Acute symptomatic bradycardia**: Atropine, transcutaneous pacing, or dopamine/epinephrine infusion [^116uzyy5].
- **Chronic management**: Permanent pacing for symptomatic SND, high-grade AV block, or chronotropic incompetence despite medical therapy [^1152vSmo].
- **Shared decision-making**: Essential for pacing decisions, especially in elderly or comorbid patients [^114MdUZW].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis varies by cause and treatment. Physiologic bradycardia is **benign**, whereas pathologic bradycardia carries higher risk, particularly with high-grade AV block or significant SND. Pacemaker therapy improves symptoms and quality of life in appropriate patients [^112q6WAQ].

---

Bradycardia is a heart rate **< 60 bpm** in adults, with clinical significance determined by symptoms and underlying cause. A structured evaluation and targeted therapy — including pacing when indicated — are key to management.

Bradycardia is a commonly observed arrhythmia and a frequent occasion for cardiac consultation. Defined as a heart rate of less than 50–60 bpm, bradycardia can be observed as a normal phenomenon in young athletic individuals, and in patients as part of normal aging or disease (Table 1). Pathology that produces bradycardia may occur within the sinus node, atrioventricular (AV) nodal tissue, and the specialized His-Purkinje conduction system. Given the overlap of heart rate ranges with non-pathologic changes, assessment of symptoms is a critical component in the evaluation and management of bradycardia. Treatment should rarely be prescribed solely on the basis of a heart rate lower than an arbitrary cutoff or a pause above certain duration. In the 2018 ACC/AHA/HRS Guideline on the Evaluation and Management of Patients with Bradycardia and Cardiac Conduction Delay (referred to hereafter as the 2018 Bradycardia Guideline), there was a significant shift in emphasis from prior guidelines that emphasized device-based implantation recommendations to a focus on evaluation and management of disease states [1,2]. In this review, we will highlight the changes in the new guideline as well as describe the key elements in evaluation and management of patients presenting with bradycardia.

Shared decision-making process — The bradycardia guideline writing committee endorses shared decision-making as part of the general care for patients with symptomatic bradycardia, and a commonly accepted definition of shared decision-making includes 4 components: 1) at least 2 participants, the clinician and patient; 2) both participants share information with each other; 3) both parties build a consensus about the preferred treatment; and 4) an agreement is reached on the treatment to implement. Notably, a recommendation based on evidence or guidelines alone is not shared decision-making, and if time permits the patient should be directed to trusted material which supports and itemizes appropriate considerations which should be factored into their decision-making.

ACC/AHA/HRS bradycardia definitions — sinus node dysfunction: Sinus bradycardia is defined as a sinus rate < 50 bpm, and ectopic atrial bradycardia is atrial depolarization from an atrial pacemaker other than the sinus node with a rate < 50 bpm. Sinoatrial exit block is evidence of blocked conduction between the sinus node and adjacent atrial tissue. A sinus pause is sinus node depolarizations ≥ 3 s after the last atrial depolarization, and sinus node arrest is no evidence of sinus node depolarization. Tachycardia-bradycardia ("tachy-brady") syndrome consists of sinus bradycardia, ectopic atrial bradycardia, or sinus pause alternating with periods of abnormal atrial tachycardia, atrial flutter, or AF. Chronotropic incompetence is broadly the inability of the heart to increase its rate commensurate with demand and in many studies translates to failure to attain 80% of expected heart rate reserve during exercise, and isorhythmic dissociation is atrial depolarization slower than ventricular depolarization from an atrioventricular nodal, His, bundle, or ventricular site.

2018 ACC/AHA/HRS bradycardia guideline — ECG role and yield in syncope notes that unless a patient with suspected bradycardia or conduction disorder is symptomatic or bradycardic at the time of the recording, the 12-lead ECG will not provide a rhythm correlation with symptoms; in patients presenting with syncope, the initial ECG provides a diagnosis in only approximately 5%, but an abnormal initial ECG is predictive of adverse outcomes in patients with syncope and near syncope, including increased all-cause mortality at 1 year and inclusion of abnormal ECG in most multivariate risk scores; risk does not necessarily indicate bradycardia as cause, as only approximately 10% of syncope can be attributed to bradycardia or a conduction disorder at initial presentation, and an additional 18% can be attributed to neurally mediated syncope which frequently manifests with both bradycardia and hypotension; ECG also helps confirm rhythm and rate, define conduction disturbance, and document abnormalities suggestive of structural or systemic disease.

Shared decision-making principles for bradycardia pacing — definition and risk–benefit context: "A commonly accepted definition of shared decision-making includes 4 components: 1) at least 2 participants, the clinician and patient; 2) both participants share information with each other; 3) both parties build a consensus about the preferred treatment; and 4) an agreement is reached on the treatment to implement". "Notably, a recommendation based on evidence or guidelines alone is not shared decision-making". While "pacemaker implantation or revision are commonly performed heart procedures and are not typically associated with high procedural risk in most patients", adverse events "such as pneumothorax and cardiac tamponade can complicate the procedure". Moreover, "patients with significant comorbid conditions may not derive the intended benefit of pacing support or an improved QOL", and "the benefit-risk ratio is not favorable if the probable benefit is also quite low", particularly in terminal progressive illness where "the benefits of pacing support may not be realized and are unlikely to positively impact the overall outcome".

Chronotropic incompetence — definitions for exercise heart rate response are summarized. The most commonly used definition in the literature has been failure to reach 80% of the expected heart rate reserve; expected heart rate reserve is defined as the difference between the age-predicted maximal heart rate (220−age) and the resting heart rate, and percentage of expected heart rate reserve is the ratio of demonstrated and predicted heart rate reserve. Other investigators suggest that another age-related equation (220 − 0.7 × age) is a better predictor for heart rate, and collectively the data suggest that the diagnosis of chronotropic incompetence in a patient requires careful individualized clinical assessment and probably cannot be determined by age alone. The definitions for atrioventricular block and conduction tissue disorders have been adapted from the 2009 AHA/ACC/HRS recommendations for the standardization of electrocardiographic measurements (both intraventricular conduction disorders and chamber hypertrophy).

The document cautions not to confuse physiologic sinus bradycardia in athletes with pathologic bradyarrhythmias and states that "the universal application of pacing therapy to treat a specific heart rate cannot be recommended except in specific circumstances".

Using the principles of shared decision-making and informed consent/refusal, patients with decision-making capacity or his/her legally defined surrogate has the right to refuse or request withdrawal of pacemaker therapy, even if the patient is pacemaker dependent, which should be considered palliative, end-of-life care, and not physician-assisted suicide, and any decision is complex, should involve all stakeholders, and will always be patient specific.

Introduction

Bradycardia is a common finding in the emergency department (ED) and presents along a clinical spectrum, ranging from asymptomatic to hemodynamic compromise and cardiac arrest.

Objective

This manuscript evaluates the management of bradycardia through a discussion of several cases.

Discussion

Bradycardia may result in severe hemodynamic compromise and is defined as a heart rate less than 60 beats per minute (bpm). There are a variety of causes and associations, including physiologic, pathologic, and pharmacologic. Patients may present with a range of signs and symptoms, from no symptoms to hemodynamic collapse. Obtaining an electrocardiogram is essential, which will determine the severity of bradycardia and underlying rhythm, including first-degree atrioventricular (AV) block, second-degree AV block, and third-degree AV block, among others. Management is based on the underlying etiology and patient hemodynamic status, aiming to improve the heart rate and address the underlying cause. Patients who are hemodynamically unstable require resuscitation with chronotropic agents and transcutaneous or transvenous pacing.

Conclusion

Severe bradycardia requires emergent management, and a knowledge of the treatment strategies can optimize patient care.

Symptomatic bradycardia — definition and attribution are described as a "documented bradyarrhythmia that is directly responsible for development of the clinical manifestations of syncope or pre-syncope, transient dizziness or lightheadedness, heart failure symptoms, or confusional states resulting from cerebral hypoperfusion attributable to slow heart rate", while noting that direct attribution of bradycardia as the sole source of symptoms is challenging; in patients with vasovagal syncope bradycardia is often accompanied by a significant vasodepressor effect, and nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue can be multifactorial and difficult to correlate with bradycardia particularly in the setting of modest resting sinus bradycardia or with exercise.

Chronotropic incompetence — exercise test definitions and calculations are outlined: the most commonly used definition in the literature has been failure to reach 80% of the expected heart rate reserve, and expected heart rate reserve is defined as the difference between the age-predicted maximal heart rate (220 − age) and the resting heart rate; percentage of expected heart rate reserve is the ratio of demonstrated and predicted heart rate reserve. Other investigators suggest that another age-related equation (220 − 0.7 × age) is a better predictor for heart rate, and collectively, the data suggest that the diagnosis of chronotropic incompetence in a patient requires careful individualized clinical assessment and probably cannot be determined by age alone. The definitions for atrioventricular block and conduction tissue disorders have been adopted from the 2009 AHA/ACCF/HRS recommendations for the standardization of electrocardiographic measurements (both intraventricular conduction disorders and chamber hypertrophy), although some have argued that stricter criteria are required for left bundle branch block (LBBB).

Heart Rhythm (2019). High credibility.

Clinical manifestations of bradycardia — symptoms and definitions: Bradycardia can be broadly classified into 2 general categories: SND and atrioventricular block. The electrocardiographic findings in patients with SND are varied and the diagnosis may be considered in patients with sinus bradycardia or atrial depolarization from a subsidiary pacemaker other than the sinus node (ie, ectopic atrial rhythm, junctional rhythm, or ventricular escape), intermittent sinus pauses, or a blunted heart rate response with exercise (chronotropic incompetence). Sudden increase in parasympathetic tone with vasovagal syncope can cause bradycardia (usually sinus node slowing or sinus arrest, but sometimes with atrioventricular block). Regardless of whether the bradycardia is caused by SND or atrioventricular block, the term "symptomatic bradycardia" is used throughout this document and has been defined as a "documented bradyarrhythmia that is directly responsible for development of the clinical manifestations of syncope or presyncope, transient dizziness or lightheadedness, heart failure symptoms, or confusional states resulting from cerebral hypoperfusion attributable to slow heart rate". Direct attribution of bradycardia as the sole source of symptoms is challenging, and nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue can be multifactorial and therefore difficult to correlate with bradycardia particularly in the setting of modest resting sinus bradycardia or with exercise.

Bradycardia and sinus node dysfunction definitions in adults — The National Institutes of Health defines bradycardia as a heart rate < 60 bpm in adults other than well trained athletes, though population studies often use a lower cutoff of 50 bpm; in a Netherlands analysis the lowest second percentile for heart rate ranged from 40 to 55 bpm depending on sex and age, and sinus pauses of 2 seconds and 3 seconds have been described during 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring in healthy elderly patients and long-distance runners. For this document, a sinus rate < 50 bpm and/or a sinus pause > 3 seconds are potential components of the definitions of sinus node dysfunction (SND); however, the presence of sinus bradycardia or a pause > 3 seconds alone should not be used for the diagnosis of SND, and with rare exceptions, the sole reason for considering any treatment for SND is the presence of symptoms. Chronotropic incompetence is described as failure to reach a target heart rate with exertion relative to expected for age that is inadequate to meet metabolic demand.

### Relationship between intraoperative and preoperative ambulatory nighttime heart rates: a secondary analysis of a prospective observational study [^113ocgPy]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

It remains unknown what constitutes physiologically relevant intraoperative bradycardia. Intraoperative bradycardia is usually defined using absolute heart rate thresholds, ignoring preoperative baseline heart rates. In contrast, we considered defining intraoperative bradycardia relative to preoperative ambulatory nighttime heart rate. Specifically, we hypothesized that the individual mean intraoperative heart rate is lower than the mean preoperative ambulatory nighttime heart rate. We, therefore, sought to investigate the relationship between the intraoperative and preoperative ambulatory nighttime heart rates in adults having noncardiac surgery with general anesthesia. Additionally, we sought to investigate the incidence of intraoperative bradycardia using relative versus absolute heart rate thresholds.

Methods

We conducted a secondary analysis of a database from a prospective study including preoperative ambulatory and intraoperative heart rates in 363 patients having noncardiac surgery with general anesthesia.

Results

The mean intraoperative heart rate was lower than the mean nighttime heart rate (mean difference, -9 bpm; 95% confidence interval [CI] -10 to -8 bpm; P < .001). The mean intraoperative heart rate was lower than the mean nighttime heart rate in 319 of 363 patients (88%; 95% CI, 84%-91%). The incidence of intraoperative bradycardia was 42% (95% CI, 38%-47%) when it was defined as intraoperative heart rate > 30% lower than mean nighttime heart rate and 43% (95% CI, 38%-49%) when it was defined as intraoperative heart rate < 45 bpm.

Conclusions

The mean intraoperative heart rate is lower than the mean nighttime heart rate in about 9 of 10 patients. Intraoperative bradycardia might thus be physiologically and clinically important. Future research needs to investigate whether there is an association between intraoperative bradycardia and postoperative outcomes.

ACC/AHA/HRS bradycardia guideline — definitions of sinus node dysfunction and atrioventricular (AV) block specify key thresholds and patterns: Sinus bradycardia is defined as "Sinus rate < 50 bpm", and a sinus pause occurs when the "Sinus node depolarizes ≥ 3 s after the last atrial depolarization", while sinus node arrest is "No evidence of sinus node depolarization". First-degree AV block has 1:1 conduction with "a PR interval > 200 ms", and second-degree AV block shows "P waves with a constant rate (< 100 bpm) where atrioventricular conduction is present but not 1:1". Mobitz type I features a constant P rate "(< 100 bpm)" with a periodic single nonconducted P wave and "nonconstant PR intervals", whereas Mobitz type II has a constant P rate "(< 100 bpm)" with a periodic single nonconducted P wave and "constant PR intervals (excluding 2:1 atrioventricular block)". In 2:1 AV block, P waves have a constant rate with "rate (< 100 bpm) where every other P wave conducts to the ventricles". Advanced or high-grade AV block is defined by " ≥ 2 consecutive P waves at a constant physiologic rate that do not conduct to the ventricles with evidence for some atrioventricular conduction", and third-degree AV block has "No evidence of atrioventricular conduction"; related terms include "Vagally mediated atrioventricular block" and "Infranodal block".

### Indications and recommendations for pacemaker therapy… [^111egJ7J]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

The decision to implant a pacemaker usually is based on symptoms of a bradyarrhythmia or tachyarrhythmia in the setting of heart disease. Symptomatic bradycardia is the most common indication. It has been defined as a "documented bradyarrhythmia that is directly responsible for the development of the clinical manifestations of frank syncope or near syncope, transient dizziness or light-headedness, and confusional states resulting from cerebral hypoperfusion and attributable to low heart rates". First-degree and type I second-degree AV block usually are caused by delayed conduction in the AV node irrespective of QRS duration. Type II second-degree AV block usually is infra-nodal, especially when the QRS is wide. Third-degree AV block may occur at any anatomic level. The decision to implant a pacemaker in a patient with abnormal AV conduction depends on the presence of symptoms related to bradycardia or ventricular arrhythmias and their prognostic implications.

Observational studies over the years strongly suggest that permanent pacing improves survival in patients with complete AV block, especially if syncope has occurred. Fascicular block refers to electrocardiographic evidence of impaired conduction below the AV node in the right bundle branch or in one or both fascicles of the left bundle branch. Bifascicular block refers to impaired conduction in two of the three fascicles; for example, right bundle branch block and a block in the left anterior-superior division of the left bundle branch. SINUS NODE DYSFUNCTION Sinus node dysfunction is a syndrome manifested by a variety of cardiac arrhythmias, including sinus bradycardia, sinoatrial block, and paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, which frequently alternates with periods of bradycardia or even asystole.

Neurocardiogenic syncope and neurally mediated syndromes account for 10 to 40 percent of syncopal episodes. Vasovagal syncope is one of the most common types of neurocardiogenic syncopal syndromes. Classically, it is preceded by a prodrome of nausea and diaphoresis and is associated with severe bradycardia. Episodes usually are triggered by pain, anxiety, or stress. A family history of syncope may be present.

Top 10 take-home messages — transcatheter aortic valve replacement and shared decision-making note that because conduction system abnormalities are common after transcatheter aortic valve replacement, recommendations on postprocedure surveillance and pacemaker implantation are made in this guideline. In patients with bradycardia who have indications for pacemaker implantation, shared decision-making and patient-centered care are endorsed and emphasized, and treatment decisions are based on the best available evidence and on the patient's goals of care and preferences. Using the principles of shared decision-making and informed consent/refusal, patients with decision-making capacity or his/her legally defined surrogate has the right to refuse or request withdrawal of pacemaker therapy, even if the patient is pacemaker dependent, which should be considered palliative, end-of-life care, and not physician-assisted suicide, and any decision is complex, should involve all stakeholders, and will always be patient specific.

Pacemaker deactivation — patients with decision-making capacity, or their legally defined surrogate, have the right to refuse or request withdrawal of pacemakers regardless of whether treatment prolongs life and even if withdrawal would result in death, and withdrawal of a life sustaining medical intervention with informed consent should not be considered physician-assisted suicide and should be considered to be an integral aspect of patient-centered care; these decisions should be undertaken by patients or legally defined surrogate and physicians together using the principles of shared decision-making, and physicians should clarify for patients or their legally defined surrogates and their families the expected consequences of pacemaker deactivation; because pacemaker pulses are painless, in most cases pacemaker deactivation is unnecessary and reassurance of patients and family in addition to turning off cardiac monitoring may be all that is needed, but if a pacemaker is deactivated, death may follow immediately if the patient is completely pacemaker dependent whereas in those who are not pacemaker dependent the process of death may be unpredictable, so patients must be monitored closely for potential symptoms such as respiratory distress which may require intensification of comfort care measures; pacemaker deactivation requires a written order from the responsible physician accompanied by a do-not-resuscitate order, with documentation confirming the patient or surrogate request, decision-making capacity or appropriate surrogate, consideration of alternative therapies, and discussion of deactivation consequences; palliative care and medical support should be provided, access to clergy (or chaplain) should be offered according to the patient's beliefs, and if a clinician has religious or ethical objections he or she should not be forced to deactivate the device and the patient should be referred to a different physician who is capable and willing; ideally, providers and healthcare systems should have processes in place for device deactivation, conversation related to end-of-life issues ideally should begin either at the time of device implant or early in the terminal illness, and clinicians should encourage patients undergoing device implantation to complete advanced directives and specifically address device management and deactivation if the patient is terminally ill.

Pacemaker deactivation and end-of-life care — physicians should clarify for patients or their legally defined surrogates and their families the expected consequences of pacemaker deactivation, and pacemaker deactivation requires a written order from the responsible physician, which should be accompanied by a do-not-resuscitate order as well. Additional documentation in the medical record should include confirmation that the patient (or legal surrogate) has requested device deactivation, capacity of the patient to make the decision or identification of the appropriate surrogate and documentation that alternative therapies as well as documentation that the consequences of deactivation have been discussed. If the decision is made to deactivate a pacemaker, patient death may follow immediately after the cessation of pacing therapy if the patient is completely pacemaker dependent; however, in those who are not pacemaker dependent, the process of death may be unpredictable. It is possible that turning off a pacemaker may lead to additional discomfort; therefore, patients must be monitored closely for potential symptoms, such as respiratory distress, which may require intensification of comfort care measures. Palliative care and medical support should be provided to the patient and family in order to provide comfort in view of potential symptoms that may arise, clinicians with religious or ethical objections should not be forced and the patient should be referred to a different physician who is willing, and clinicians should encourage patients undergoing device implantation to complete advanced directives and specifically address device management and deactivation if the patient is terminally ill.

Conduction disorders with 1:1 atrioventricular conduction — scope, definitions, pathophysiology, and presentation — are described as QRS abnormalities due to fascicular blocks and bundle branch blocks caused by delayed or blocked conduction within ≥ 1 of the branches of the His-Purkinje system; the combination of delayed or blocked conduction of the right bundle branch and 1 of the left bundle's fascicles is denoted bifascicular block, and first-degree atrioventricular block is more accurately a conduction disorder rather than atrioventricular block though discussed elsewhere. The normal conduction axis comprises the sinus node, atrial muscle, atrioventricular node, His bundle, bundle branches, fascicles, Purkinje fibers, and ventricular muscle, and pathophysiology may be developmental, hereditary/genetic, metabolic, infectious, inflammatory, infiltrative, traumatic, ischemic, malignant, or degenerative; in general, it may be helpful to characterize the process as static or progressive. Isolated fascicular and bundle branch blocks are rarely associated with symptoms on their own, their presence may be a marker for underlying structural heart disease, and cardiac dyssynchrony from left bundle-branch block (LBBB) may cause symptoms.

The goal of therapy for bradycardia or tachycardia is to rapidly identify and treat patients who are hemodynamically unstable or symptomatic due to the arrhythmia. Drugs or, when appropriate, pacing may be used to control unstable or symptomatic bradycardia. Cardioversion or drugs or both may be used to control unstable or symptomatic tachycardia. ACLS providers should closely monitor stable patients pending expert consultation and should be prepared to aggressively treat those with evidence of decompensation.

Atrioventricular block — definitions and ECG interpretation are described as follows: First-degree atrioventricular block is each P wave conducted with a prolonged PR interval > 200 ms. Second-degree atrioventricular block is sub-classified into Mobitz I (Wenckebach conduction) and Mobitz II, where Mobitz I follows gradual PR prolongation and Mobitz II does not, and the ECG will show group beating due to "dropped" QRS complexes. Atrioventricular block with only 2:1 block cannot be classified as Mobitz I or II. High-grade, high-degree, or advanced atrioventricular block refers to situations where ≥ 2 consecutive P waves at a normal rate are not conducted without complete loss of atrioventricular conduction, and high-degree atrioventricular block is generally considered to be intra- or infra-Hisian and treated with pacing. Third-degree or complete atrioventricular block implies no conduction at all from atria to ventricles and may be paroxysmal or persistent with a junctional or ventricular escape mechanism, and complete atrioventricular block may be imputed in atrial fibrillation (AF) when the ventricular response is slow (< 50 bpm) and regular. Careful evaluation of the ECG is required because a 1:1 relationship between P waves and QRS complexes may not be present when atrial and ventricular rates are similar (isorhythmic dissociation) or when the atrial rate is slower than the ventricular rate from sinus bradycardia with an accelerated junctional rhythm; in atrial bigeminy premature atrial contractions can lead to an erroneous diagnosis, and in unusual circumstances a vagal etiology may be considered especially when the QRS in narrow.

Sinus node dysfunction (SND) — clinical presentation includes symptoms that can range from mild fatigue to frank syncope, and the severity generally correlates with the heart rate or pause duration. Other clinical symptoms include dyspnea on exertion caused by chronotropic incompetence, lightheadedness, and chronic fatigue. Patients may have symptoms attributable to sinus bradycardia, sinus arrest or sinoatrial exit block, and correlation between symptoms and bradycardia is considered to be the "gold standard" of diagnosis, though this correlation may be difficult to establish due to competing etiologies and monitoring limitations.

The following constitutes key background information on sick sinus syndrome:

- **Definition**: Sick sinus syndrome is a group of heart rhythm disorders characterized by abnormal functioning of the sinus node leading to various cardiac arrhythmias, particularly bradycardia.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of sick sinus syndrome involves intrinsic abnormal impulse formation and/or propagation from the sinus node. Age-related interstitial fibrosis is considered a common pathophysiological mechanism. In some cases, the dysfunction also favors the onset of atrial arrhythmias, leading to a more complex clinical condition known as "bradycardia-tachycardia syndrome".
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of sick sinus syndrome in the US is estimated at 0.8 per 100,000 person-years.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for sick sinus syndrome include advanced age, AF, hypertension, elevated levels of N-terminal pro-BNP and cystatin C, greater height and BMI, white race, history of CVDs, and genetic factors.
- **Disease course**: The clinical course of sick sinus syndrome can vary widely. Early stages may be inconspicuous, but as the disease progresses, patients may present with symptoms and signs of end-organ hypoperfusion, particularly cerebral hypoperfusion, that may lead to intermittent symptoms such as syncope and pre-syncope. Mild symptoms such as irritability, lassitude, inability to concentrate, forgetfulness, palpitations, and dizziness are common. Bradycardia-tachycardia syndrome may further lead to hemodynamic changes and cause peripheral vascular embolism, stroke, and other serious consequences such as syncope and Adams-Stokes syndrome.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of sick sinus syndrome is variable and depends on the severity of the condition and the presence of other comorbidities. Pacemaker implantation is the first-line treatment for symptomatic patients with sick sinus syndrome and documented bradycardia history, which can significantly improve symptoms and QoL.

### Association of bradycardia with incident CVD and mortality… [^112CTvRQ]. JAMA Network (2016). Excellent credibility.

Importance Bradycardia has been associated with lower cardiovascular disease risk in selected populations. There is a paucity of information available about heart rate less than 50 beats per minute among middle-aged or older adults. Objective To determine whether asymptomatic bradycardia was associated with a lower cardiovascular risk profile, less subclinical atherosclerosis, and decreased incident CVD and mortality. Bradycardia has traditionally been defined as a heart rate of less than 60 beats per minute or an HR of less than 501–3 bpm. Multiple studies demonstrate that higher resting HR predicts poor cardiovascular outcomes both independent of conventional risk factors and within subgroups of patients with cardiovascular disease. 4–11 Resting heart rate has been demonstrated to be modifiable over time with respect to the interaction of genes12 and environmental factors such as exercise, 13, 14 medical conditions and medications.

However, the impact of bradycardia is less clear. Bradycardia often is found in athletic adults and is typically asymptomatic. 15 Among nonathletes, whether persons with bradycardia have higher levels of cardiovascular fitness, or abnormalities in the conduction system is unclear. Particularly among the elderly population, some with bradycardia have symptoms requiring pacemaker implantation. Tresch and Fleg16 examined a sample and reported that sinus bradycardia in apparently healthy, nonathletic individuals older than 40 years showed no association with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Other studies10, 17, 18 suggested that asymptomatic bradycardia may be associated with modestly reduced cardiovascular disease mortality.

Major ECG abnormalities included major ventricular conduction defect; definite myocardial infarction; possible myocardial infarction; major isolated -ST/-T abnormalities; left ventricular hypertrophy; major atrioventricular conduction abnormalities; and major QT prolongation, pacemaker, and other major arrhythmias. After adjustment, the slight excess of CVD events among those with an HR of less than 50 bpm was not significant. In contrast, CVD risk was consistently statistically significantly elevated for those with HR 80 and above.

2018 ACC/AHA/HRS bradycardia and conduction disease evaluation algorithm — For a patient with symptoms suggestive of or consistent with bradycardia or conduction disorder, initial steps include comprehensive history and physical examination (Class I), electrocardiogram (ECG) (Class I), and directed blood testing (Class IIa). If the initial evaluation is nondiagnostic, the pathway includes echocardiography if structural heart disease suspected, and for exercise-related symptoms it includes exercise ECG testing (Class IIa) followed by ambulatory ECG monitoring (Class I). For infrequent symptoms (> 30 days), ICM (Class IIa) is shown, with monitor choice based on the frequency of symptoms. When there are no significant arrhythmias, observation is shown; the algorithm also references SND Diagnostic algorithm†, AV Block Diagnostic algorithm‡, and Conduction disorder with 1:1 AV conduction Diagnostic algorithm§, with dashed lines indicating possible optional strategies based on the specific clinical situation.

### 2021 ACC / AHA key data elements and definitions for heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical data standards (writing committee to develop clinical data standards for heart failure) [^115mh2eg]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2021). High credibility.

Atrial arrhythmias other than atrial fibrillation or flutter — definitions include: Atrial tachycardia as an electrocardiographic finding of a cardiac rhythm > 100 bpm that originates from the atria or sinoatrial node; sick sinus syndrome as a constellation of signs and symptoms which may include syncope, fatigue, dizziness, and alternating periods of bradycardia and atrial tachycardia caused by sinoatrial node and/or AV nodal dysfunction; and paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia as an electrocardiographic finding of episodic supraventricular tachycardia with abrupt onset and termination.

Evaluation of bradycardia and conduction disease — patients with symptoms suggestive of or consistent with bradycardia or conduction disorder proceed with comprehensive history and physical examination (Class I), directed blood testing (Class IIa), and echocardiography if structural heart disease suspected. The algorithm includes exercise electrocardiogram (ECG) testing (Class IIa) and ambulatory ECG monitoring (Class I), with monitor choice based on the frequency of symptoms and a branch for infrequent symptoms (> 30 days). Diagnostic pathways include SND Diagnostic algorithm†, AV Block Diagnostic algorithm‡, and a conduction disorder Diagnostic algorithm§ for conduction disorder with 1:1 AV conduction.
