## Question

a klatskin can be biopsied? how?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a Klatskin tumor can be biopsied and, if so, how it should be done. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what a Klatskin tumor is and why biopsy is controversial. Then, I should verify guideline-based recommendations on when to biopsy versus when to avoid biopsy. Next, I will examine the preferred biopsy modalities and their diagnostic yield. After that, I need to check safety considerations, including tumor seeding and procedural risks. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise approach and confirm the bottom line with supporting references.

> Let me first confirm the entity and the diagnostic challenge. A Klatskin tumor is a perihilar cholangiocarcinoma at the confluence of the right and left hepatic ducts; it often presents with obstructive jaundice and is difficult to distinguish radiographically from other hilar strictures, which is why tissue diagnosis is sometimes needed but also sometimes avoided due to oncologic risks [^115eFRxg] [^112WZEyV].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about biopsy for everyone. I need to check guideline positions on when to avoid biopsy. Major guidelines advise against biopsy in patients who are surgical candidates with resectable disease because of the risk of tumor seeding and the fact that a negative biopsy does not exclude malignancy; instead, these patients should proceed to curative-intent surgery without preoperative biopsy when imaging and clinical context are convincing [^115eFRxg] [^115w41nJ].

> Next, I should review when biopsy is indicated. I should confirm that biopsy is recommended for patients with advanced or inoperable disease, for those in whom the diagnosis is equivocal, or when nonoperative therapy (such as systemic therapy or liver transplantation) is planned, as histologic confirmation and molecular profiling are required to guide treatment and eligibility for trials or transplant protocols [^115eFRxg] [^114t33Ft] [^111fFbLm].

> Now, I will examine the preferred biopsy modalities. Wait, let me verify the hierarchy. ESMO recommends EUS-guided FNA or fine-needle biopsy as the preferred approach when feasible because it avoids transperitoneal seeding and can sample both the primary lesion and regional nodes; ERCP-guided forceps biopsy or brushings are alternatives but have lower sensitivity, and percutaneous transhepatic approaches are generally discouraged due to higher seeding risk, though they may be considered if EUS is not available or if sampling a metastatic site is needed [^115eFRxg] [^111ycHBV] [^111fFbLm] [^111c9Z5K].

> I should double-check diagnostic yield to set expectations. Brush cytology and intraductal forceps biopsy via ERCP have sensitivities around 45–48% individually, and combining them only modestly improves sensitivity to about 59%, whereas EUS-guided sampling generally achieves higher diagnostic yield and also enables nodal assessment; this is why EUS is preferred when tissue is needed and accessible [^111fFbLm] [^115eFRxg].

> Let me consider safety and complications. I need to ensure I mention tumor seeding, bleeding, and cholangitis. Needle-track seeding risk is real but likely low, with reported ranges up to 0–4% in liver biopsies, and the risk is minimized by using EUS rather than percutaneous routes; major bleeding occurs in fewer than 2% of percutaneous liver biopsies, and cholangitis risk is inherent to biliary instrumentation but can be mitigated by prophylactic antibiotics and careful technique [^112QPwnG] [^115eFRxg].

> But wait, what if the lesion is indeterminate after initial sampling? I should confirm the next steps. If ERCP-based sampling is negative or inconclusive, EUS-guided biopsy should be pursued; if two negative sampling sessions still leave high suspicion for malignancy, multidisciplinary review is advised, and additional pathologic or surgical input should be sought rather than repeatedly exposing the patient to low-yield procedures [^115eFRxg] [^115eFRxg].

> I will now synthesize a practical approach. For potentially resectable Klatskin tumors with classic imaging and clinical features, avoid preoperative biopsy and proceed to surgical resection. For unresectable disease, equivocal cases, or when nonoperative therapy is planned, obtain tissue via EUS-guided FNA or core needle biopsy when feasible; if EUS is not available or not diagnostic, consider ERCP-guided forceps or brushings, and reserve percutaneous transhepatic biopsy for selected scenarios such as sampling metastases or when endoscopic routes fail, always discussing seeding risk and planning the tract within a future resection field if possible [^115eFRxg] [^115eFRxg] [^111c9Z5K].

> Bottom line, I should confirm the answer clearly. Yes, Klatskin tumors can be biopsied, but biopsy is not routine for all patients; it is reserved for selected indications, with EUS-guided sampling preferred when tissue is needed, ERCP-based sampling as an alternative, and percutaneous approaches generally avoided due to seeding risk; decisions should be made in a multidisciplinary setting to balance diagnostic yield against oncologic safety [^111aeWFU] [^115eFRxg] [^111c9Z5K].

Klatskin tumors can be biopsied, but **biopsy is not routine** for resectable cases due to the risk of tumor seeding and the limited impact on surgical planning [^115eFRxg]. Biopsy is indicated for **inoperable or equivocal cases** to guide non-surgical therapy or when the diagnosis is uncertain [^111c9Z5K]. The preferred method is **EUS-guided FNA** [^111aeWFU] for its high yield and lower seeding risk; ERCP with forceps or brushings is an alternative when EUS is unavailable or inconclusive [^111ycHBV] [^112xnTzB]. Percutaneous biopsy is generally avoided because of higher seeding risk and is reserved for selected cases [^115eFRxg]. All decisions should be made in a multidisciplinary setting [^113Zx39W].

---

## Indications for biopsy in Klatskin tumors

Biopsy is **not routinely performed** in all cases of Klatskin tumors. The decision to biopsy depends on several factors, including resectability, clinical presentation, and the need for histopathological confirmation. The following scenarios typically warrant biopsy:

- **Inoperable or advanced disease**: In patients with advanced or inoperable Klatskin tumors, biopsy is recommended to confirm the diagnosis and guide palliative chemotherapy or targeted therapy [^111c9Z5K] [^114t33Ft].

- **Equivocal cases**: When imaging and clinical findings are inconclusive, biopsy may be necessary to differentiate malignant from benign strictures or other biliary pathologies [^115eFRxg] [^113Zx39W].

- **Non-surgical management**: If the patient is being considered for non-surgical treatments such as radiation therapy or systemic chemotherapy, histopathological confirmation is essential [^114t33Ft].

Conversely, biopsy is generally avoided in patients deemed suitable for **radical surgical resection** because of the risk of tumor seeding and the limited impact on surgical management [^115eFRxg] [^116Awvt4].

## Biopsy techniques for Klatskin tumors

Several **biopsy techniques** are available for obtaining tissue from Klatskin tumors, each with its own advantages and limitations:

| **Technique** | **Description** | **Advantages** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) | Minimally invasive technique using endoscopic ultrasound to guide needle aspiration of tumor tissue | - High diagnostic yield <br/> - Lower risk of tumor seeding compared to percutaneous approaches <br/> - Ability to sample regional lymph nodes [^111aeWFU] | - Requires specialized equipment and expertise <br/> - May not be feasible in all anatomical configurations |
| Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with forceps biopsy or brush cytology | Endoscopic technique allowing direct visualization and sampling of biliary strictures | - Direct visualization of the stricture <br/> - Ability to perform therapeutic interventions such as biliary drainage [^113PSmPg] | - Lower diagnostic yield compared to EUS-FNA <br/> - Risk of cholangitis and pancreatitis [^113ivQ36] |
| Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC) guided biopsy | Image-guided percutaneous approach to sample hilar lesions | - Useful when endoscopic approaches are not feasible <br/> - Can provide access for biliary drainage [^114xBxUK] | - Higher risk of tumor seeding <br/> - Invasive procedure with potential complications [^115eFRxg] |

---

## Diagnostic yield and accuracy

The **diagnostic yield** varies by technique:

- **EUS-FNA**: High diagnostic yield, particularly useful for sampling hilar masses and regional lymph nodes [^111aeWFU].

- **ERCP with forceps biopsy or brush cytology**: Lower sensitivity, approximately 45–60%, but highly specific [^111fFbLm].

- **PTC-guided biopsy**: Useful in selected cases but associated with higher risk of tumor seeding and complications [^115eFRxg].

---

## Risks and complications

Biopsy of Klatskin tumors carries potential risks and complications, including:

- **Tumor seeding**: Risk of tumor dissemination along the biopsy tract, particularly with percutaneous approaches [^115eFRxg].

- **Bleeding**: Particularly in patients with coagulopathy or thrombocytopenia [^112QPwnG].

- **Infection**: Risk of cholangitis, especially with ERCP-based approaches [^113ivQ36].

- **Pancreatitis**: Potential complication of ERCP [^113ivQ36].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines emphasize a **multidisciplinary approach** when deciding whether to biopsy a Klatskin tumor:

- **ESMO guidelines**: Recommend avoiding biopsy in patients suitable for radical surgery and prefer EUS-guided biopsy in selected cases, particularly in equivocal lesions or advanced disease [^115eFRxg] [^111c9Z5K].

- **NCCN guidelines**: Emphasize the importance of histopathological confirmation in inoperable cases and recommend core biopsy for molecular profiling [^114t33Ft].

- **Multidisciplinary team review**: Essential for individualized decision-making, particularly in complex or equivocal cases [^113Zx39W].

---

## Conclusion

Klatskin tumors can be biopsied, but the decision to do so should be individualized based on resectability, clinical presentation, and the need for histopathological confirmation. EUS-guided FNA is the **preferred method** due to its high diagnostic yield and lower risk of complications, while ERCP-based approaches are alternatives when EUS is not feasible. Percutaneous biopsy is generally avoided due to the higher risk of tumor seeding. All decisions should be made within a multidisciplinary framework to optimize patient outcomes [^111aeWFU] [^115eFRxg].

### Demographics, tumor characteristics, treatment, and survival of patients with Klatskin tumors [^115k5heh]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

In conclusion, Klatskin tumors, or hilar CCAs, are rare gastrointestinal tumors that have declined in incidence over the past decade in the United States. The majority of these tumors are diagnosed in their advanced stages with metastases. Surgery is regarded as the best treatment modality for these tumors. However, only a small number of patients are treated surgically, probably because they present in advanced stages. The tumors continue to carry a poor prognosis, with median survival duration measured in months.

Summary Box

What is already known:

Klatskin tumors, or hilar cholangiocarcinomas, are rare in the United States population but they may have a rising incidence
The incidence of Klatskin tumors increases with age and patients younger than 20 years of age are rare
The only curative treatment for hilar cholangiocarcinoma is margin-negative surgical resection

What the new findings are:

The annual incidence of Klatskin tumors has actually declined in the United States over the past decade
Even though surgery is the preferred treatment, only a minority (26.8%) of patients are amenable to surgical resection, as they present in advanced stages with metastases
These tumors continue to carry a poor prognosis, with median survival duration measured in months

Discussion

Klatskin tumors, or hilar CCAs, are rare in the US population, but recent data suggests a rising incidence. Our study provides the most recent comprehensive information on Klatskin tumors from the SEER cancer registry. The SEER database was used for this analysis as it is an extensive data center for cancer incidence, staging, treatment, and survival derived from population-based cancer registries of the United States. Contrary to prior reports, our study highlights a decline in the annual incidence of these tumors, with the highest incidence in 2005 and the lowest in 2010 (Fig. 1). The exact reason for this decline is not clearly understood. However, it may in part be explained by a possible decrease in incidence of the risk factors for Klatskin tumors in the US population. Further studies are warranted for a better understanding of this decreasing trend.

Klatskin tumors had the highest incidence among Asians and Pacific islanders, who had an age-adjusted incidence rate of 0.48 per 1,000,000. Factors that explain this racial predisposition for Asians to developing Klatskin tumors include the increased rate of hepatolithiasis and liver-fluke infections among these patients. The highest prevalence of CCA has been reported from Southeast Asia. The reason behind the increased predisposition to these tumors among Asians in the United States who lack the usual risk factors may, however, suggest an alternative pathogenesis. Our analysis noted that the incidence of Klatskin tumors increases with age, with a peak between 60s-80s. It can affect all age groups, but the age distribution seen in our study is similar to prior reports. We noted that no cases were reported in patients younger than 24 years, which suggests chronic long-standing inflammation with advancing age leading to hyperplasia as an underlying pathogenic mechanism.

### Demographics, tumor characteristics, treatment, and survival of patients with Klatskin tumors [^112gTS6S]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

The only curative treatment for hilar CCA is margin-negative surgical resection, which usually consists of en bloc resection of the bile duct, extended liver resection and portal vein resection. There are no trials that demonstrate a therapeutic benefit for radiation, chemotherapy or combination therapy. The majority of the patients in our analysis were treated with radiation; however, those treated surgically fared better. Our study notes that, even though surgery is the preferred treatment for these tumors, only a minority (26.8%) of them were amenable to surgical resection. This is probably because most of these patients present in stages where the disease is too advanced for recovery by surgical resection.

We acknowledge several limitations in our study. First, it had an observational and retrospective design. Though the SEER database is large, our sample size of 254 Klatskin tumors is small. In addition, SEER does not provide data on various topics, including chemotherapeutic regimen and dose, local and distant recurrence data, and comorbidities. Another limitation of SEER is related to the ICD-O coding error of Klatskin tumors. We minimized this limitation somewhat by excluding cases before 2004; by doing this, we were able to avoid the coding error associated with ICD-O-2, where Klatskin tumors were assigned to the topography code for intrahepatic biliary duct tumors. However, ICD-O-3 uses the histology code 8162/3 for either intra- or extrahepatic bile duct tumors and does not use specific codes for intra- or extrahepatic, rendering our analysis imperfect given the possibility of coding misclassification. This issue can only be solved when specific histology codes are assigned to these tumors. Furthermore, the SEER database lacks data regarding risk factors, clinical presentation, duration of symptoms, diagnostic modalities employed, or the use of endoscopic ultrasonography, cholangioscopy, fluorescence in situ hybridization for tissue diagnosis, positron emission tomography scan data, or details regarding biliary drainage, which would have made our study even more robust and comprehensive.

NCCN Extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma — principles of pathology specify histology and key reporting elements: Histologic confirmation of primary hepatic malignancy with cholangiocyte differentiation is listed, and to establish cholangiocyte differentiation by histology and if appropriate supported by immunohistochemical and albumin in-situ hybridization studies. The following parameters should be reported for cancer with histopathologic type, and perihilar, Klatskin type, and distal bile duct cancers have separate staging parameters; perihilar tumors are defined by a tumor arising in the main lobar ducts in the extrahepatic biliary system proximal to the cystic duct, while extrahepatic bile duct cancers are defined as tumors arising in the extrahepatic biliary tree between the confluence of the cystic duct and common hepatic duct and the Ampulla of Vater, and tumors of the Ampulla of Vater (hepatopancreatic ampulla) are staged separately. Reported parameters for perihilar bile duct include carcinoma in situ/high-grade dysplasia and tumor extent (T stage) with invasion categories including confined to the bile duct; tumor depth of invasion into or through bile duct muscle layer or fibrous tissue, bile duct wall, surrounding adipose tissue, adjacent hepatic parenchyma, uni- or bilateral branches of the portal vein or hepatic artery, main portal vein, and second-order biliary radicals with contralateral portal vein or hepatic artery involvement. For extrahepatic bile duct, parameters include carcinoma in situ/high-grade dysplasia and depth of tumor invasion into the bile duct wall categorized as less than 5 mm 5–12 mm greater than 12 mm, plus whether tumor involves the celiac axis, superior mesenteric artery, and/or common hepatic artery, the number of regional lymph nodes (N stage), and distant organ metastasis (M stage). If adequate sampling, identify individual blocks containing malignant tissue and non-malignant tissue ideal for further testing, and if adequate sample available, list histopathologic types of extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. Background liver disease directives are to indicate the presence or absence of chronic liver disease (viral hepatitis, MASLD, metabolic disorder, etc) either from the clinical history or histopathologic changes, and report the degree of fibrosis and the presence or absence of cirrhosis. Notes include that a well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor is not staged as extrahepatic biliary carcinoma and that for rare histologies with distinct systemic therapies (such as pure neuroendocrine tumors or sarcomas), recommend treatment according to the relevant NCCN Guideline for those tumor histologic types, with the notation that all recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for Klatskin tumor, more specifically with respect to biliary stenting, ACR 2019 guidelines recommend to place an endoscopic internal biliary catheter with a removable plastic stent as an initial therapeutic procedure in patients with dilated bile ducts and coagulopathy (INR > 2.0 or platelet count < 60, 000) or moderate-to-massive ascites.

### Ovarian metastasis from Klatskin tumour [^1141toNU]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Hilar cholangiocarcinoma, a rare bile duct malignancy, typically metastasises to the liver, lungs or lymph nodes, with ovarian involvement being exceedingly rare. We present a case of a South Asian woman in her mid-30s with abdominal pain, constipation, right upper quadrant discomfort and fever. Imaging and histopathological analysis of biopsy confirmed a hilar mass with ovarian metastasis, supported by elevated CA 19–9 levels. Palliative biliary stenting was performed, but the patient succumbed 6months postdiagnosis. This case highlights the importance of recognising atypical metastatic patterns in hilar cholangiocarcinoma to guide diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.

### Hilar cholangiocarcinoma: current management [^111bv29B]. Annals of Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the literature with regard to outcome of surgical management for hilar cholangiocarcinoma (Klatskin tumor).

Background

Hilar cholangiocarcinoma is a rare tumor with a poor prognosis. Surgical resection provides the only possibility for cure. Advances in hepatobiliary imaging and surgical strategies to treat this disease have resulted in improved postoperative outcomes.

Methods

We performed a review of the English literature on hilar cholangiocarcinoma from 1990 to 2007. This review included preoperative evaluation, surgical techniques, issues and controversies in management, prognostic variables, and considerations for future directions.

Results

Complete resection remains the most effective and only potentially curative therapy for hilar cholangiocarcinoma. Negative resection margins are associated with improved outcomes, and major hepatic resections have enhanced the likelihood of R0 resection. Portal vein embolization may be indicated in selected patients before extensive hepatic resection. Staging laparoscopy should be considered to detect occult metastatic disease. Orthotopic liver transplantation might be applicable for a highly selected subgroup.

Conclusions

Surgical resection including major hepatic resection remains the mainstay of treatment of hilar cholangiocarcinoma. Additional evidence is needed to fully define the role of orthotopic liver transplantation. Improvements in adjuvant therapy are essential for improving long-term outcome.

### ASGE guideline on the role of endoscopy in the management of malignant hilar obstruction [^115JMDT3]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2021). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for Klatskin tumor, more specifically with respect to biliary stenting, ASGE 2021 guidelines recommend to consider using the following stents in patients with unresectable malignant hilar obstruction undergoing endoscopic palliative endoscopic stent placement:

- self-expandable metal stents in patients with a short life expectancy (< 3 months) or in patients placing high value on avoiding repeated interventions

- plastic stents if an optimal drainage strategy has not been established

- otherwise, either stent type based on local expertise and physician preference.

### The surgical management of Klatskin tumours: has anything changed in the last decade? [^115nLrLg]. World Journal of Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Surgical treatment of hilar cholangiocarcinomas requires complex pre-, intra- and post-operative decision-making. Despite the significant progress in liver surgery over the years, several issues such as the role of pre-operative biliary drainage, portal vein embolisation, staging laparoscopy and neo-adjuvant chemotherapy remain unresolved. Operative strategies such as vascular resection, caudate lobe resection and liver transplant have also been practiced in order to improve R0 resectability and improved survival. The review aims to consolidate evidence from major studies in the last 11 years. Survival data were only included from studies that reported the results in at least 30 patients with 1-year follow-up. A significant number of patients may be prevented an unnecessary laparotomy if they underwent a staging laparoscopy. There remain no guidelines as to when portal vein embolisation or pre-operative biliary drainage should be employed but most studies agree with pre-operative biliary drainage being an absolute indication if portal vein embolisation is performed. Concomitant hepatectomy and caudate lobectomy increases R0 resection but vascular resection cannot be routinely recommended. Liver transplant at specialised centres in selective patients has had impressive results. Guidelines are required for pre-operative biliary drainage and portal vein embolisation and randomised trials are required in order to define the role of vascular resection in achieving a R0 resection and increasing survival.

### Endoscopic or percutaneous biliary drainage for Klatskin tumors? [^115XtgPa]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

Controversy exists regarding the preferred biliary drainage technique in patients with Klatskin tumors because few comparative studies exist. This study compared outcomes of endoscopic biliary drainage (EBD) and percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD).

Materials and Methods

Consecutive patients (N = 129) with Klatskin tumors treated with initial EBD or PTBD were identified, and their clinical histories were retrospectively reviewed. The primary endpoint was the time to therapeutic success (TTS), defined as the time between the first drainage and a total bilirubin measurement of 40 μmol/L or lower.

Results

EBD was the first biliary decompression procedure performed in 87 patients; PTBD was performed first in 42. Technical success rates (78% with EBD vs 98% with PTBD; P = 0.004) and therapeutic success rates (49% vs 79%, respectively; P = 0.002) were significantly lower in the EBD group than in the PTBD group. Forty-four patients in the EBD group (51%) subsequently underwent PTBD before therapeutic success was achieved or antitumoral treatment was started. Median TTSs were 61 days in the EBD group and 44 days in the PTBD group, and multivariate analysis showed a hazard ratio of 0.63 (95% confidence interval, 0.41–0.99; P = 0.045). In patients treated with surgery or chemotherapy with or without radiation therapy, median times to treatment were 76 and 68 days in the EBD and PTBD groups, respectively (P = 0.76). Cholangitis occurred in 25% and 21% of patients in the EBD and PTBD groups, respectively (P = 0.34).

Conclusions

PTBD should be seriously considered for biliary decompression when treating patients with Klatskin tumor.

### Hilar tuberculosis versus Klatskin tumour: a diagnostic challenge [^116b1DZe]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Hepatobiliary tuberculosis is a rare condition causing obstructive jaundice either by enlarged lymph nodes around the bile ducts or involvement of biliary epithelium by the tuberculous process. Since a tissue diagnosis is not mandatory to proceed with the resection or initiation of a liver transplant protocol, benign lesions are occasionally misdiagnosed as hilar cholangiocarcinoma. Here, we present a case of hepatobiliary tuberculosis which presented as obstructive jaundice due to hilar obstruction. The mass causing the obstruction was then later found to be a pseudotumour, typical of tuberculosis. This diagnosis meant that extensive surgical resection as a protocol for cholangiocarcinoma was avoided. The patient recovered completely after a course of antitubercular therapy.

A 55-year-old immunocompetent woman was presented with features of obstructive jaundice and a clinicoradiological picture suggestive of a hilar cholangiocarcinoma (Klatskin tumour). However, caseating granulomatous lesion associated with miliary nodules were revealed intraoperatively. The lesion responded to standard antituberculous therapy. This unusual presentation highlights the considerable diagnostic challenge in such case.

### Staging laparoscopy for hilar cholangiocarcinoma: is it still worthwhile? [^111Hc3ST]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2011). Low credibility.

Hilar cholangiocarcinoma (HCCA), or Klatskin tumor, is a rare cancer that arises at the confluence of the right and left hepatic ducts, with an incidence of 2.5 per 100,000. Radical surgery is the only curative treatment due to the lack of effective systemic therapy. Many different imaging techniques, including computed tomography (CT), abdominal ultrasound (US), percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC), endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), positron emission tomography (PET), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), are used for the staging of HCCA. Despite the multitude of diagnostic tools, only 50–60% of patients who are surgically explored are ultimately amenable to a potentially curative resection.

Peritoneal, nodal, and liver metastases, as well as locally advanced disease, are the main reasons for unresectability in patients with HCCA. In an attempt to prevent an unnecessary laparotomy, staging laparoscopy (SL) has been performed in patients with HCCA, thereby decreasing operative morbidity and length of hospital stay associated with a laparotomy.–In 2002, we evaluated the use of SL in patients with malignant proximal bile duct obstruction in our center and concluded, on the basis of a yield of 42%, that SL should be performed routinely in the workup for these patients.

The accuracy of radiologic imaging techniques has continued to improve. Recently, additional techniques, such as PET and multi-slice CT, have been added to the staging armamentarium. These advances in staging are likely to impact the yield and accuracy of SL. Hence, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the benefit of SL for staging of patients with suspected hilar cholangiocarcinoma during the past 10 years in our institution, in which time imaging modalities have greatly improved.

### Challenging biliary strictures: pathophysiological features, differential diagnosis, diagnostic algorithms, and new clinically relevant biomarkers-part 1 [^112WZEyV]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Cholangiocarcinoma

CCA is rare (incidence in the US, 1.3 per 100,000/year) but it is becoming more frequent worldwide.CCA occurs slightly more often in men, (male/female ratio, 1.3:1) during the sixth to eighth decade. CCAs are classified according to their location as intrahepatic, perihilar (also called Klatskin tumours, two-thirds of CCAs), and distal, or according to their macroscopic appearance as mass-forming, periductal-infiltrating, or intraductal growth. Klatskin tumours are further classified according to the level of biliary obstruction from type I to IV using the Bismuth-Corlette classification. Risk factors include hepatitis C virus infection, chronic biliary inflammation (e.g. PSC, parasitic biliary infestation), and some types of choledochal cysts and anomalous pancreaticobiliary junctions.

Clinical features

Tumour location dictates the symptoms and signs of CCA. Intrahepatic CCAs may cause a dull constant pain in the right upper quadrant, whereas hilar and extrahepatic CCAs cause jaundice, pain, and weight loss. Cholangitis is rare at presentation. At clinical examination, hepatomegaly, tumor mass, or Courvoisier's sign may be detected.

### Percutaneous irreversible electroporation of unresectable hilar cholangiocarcinoma (Klatskin tumor): a case report [^111DQBvS]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Case Presentation

A 66-year-old female is presented with silent icterus (bilirubin 89 µm/L, alkaline phosphatasis U/L). Computed tomography (CT) imaging showed a 30 × 30 × 38 mm mass in the liver hilum surrounding the common and the left and right main bile ducts (Bismuth–Corlette type IV) (Fig. 1 A, B). There was no sign of lymph nodal or metastatic spread and all the blood vessels were patent. An endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided core needle biopsy of the lesion confirmed the diagnosis of hilar cholangioadenocarcinoma. Because of biliary obstruction, a plastic retrievable endoprosthesis was placed and renewed several times, but due to repeated congestion of the endoprosthesis, it was eventually replaced for a metallic Wallstent and bilirubin levels normalized (14 µm/L). After establishing local disease progression at 3 months, she was referred to our centre.

The patient was discussed in our weekly multidisciplinary hepatobiliary tumor board consisting of a radiologist, interventional radiologist, hepatobiliary surgeon, medical oncologist, hepato-gastroenterologist, radiotherapist, and nuclear radiologist. All potential risks and benefits of IRE near the portal triad with a metallic stent in situ were carefully outweighed against best supportive care. Since the stent did not reach into the duodenum, the risk of damaging the duodenal wall was considered low. After careful deliberation, the patient opted for IRE and gave written informed consent.

### Demographics, tumor characteristics, treatment, and survival of patients with Klatskin tumors [^117BtDLY]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The objective of this study was to investigate the incidence, demographics, tumor characteristics, treatment, and survival of patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma.

Methods

Data on Klatskin tumors between 2004 and 2013 was extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Registry. The epidemiology of these tumors was then analyzed.

Results

A total of 254 patients with Klatskin tumors were identified. The overall age-adjusted incidence of Klatskin tumors between 2004 and 2013 was 0.38 per 1,000,000 per year. A gradual decline in the incidence was noted, with the highest (0.44) in 2005 and lowest (0.24) in 2010. Males had a higher incidence of Klatskin tumors compared to females (0.47 vs. 0.25 per 1,000,000 per year). These tumors were more common among Asian and Pacific islanders, who had an age-adjusted incidence rate of 0.48 per 1,000,000. Incidence increased with age, with the peak incidence between the ages of 80 and 84 years. The majority of the tumors were extrahepatic (67.3%). Approximately one-fourth (22.4%) of these patients had metastatic disease at presentation. Only 26.8% of patients had surgically resectable disease at presentation. One- and 5-year cause-specific survival for Klatskin tumors was 41% and 10.4%, respectively, with a median survival of 7 months. On Cox proportional hazard regression analysis, extrahepatic tumors (hazard ratio [HR] 0.54, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.37–0.80, P = 0.02) and those treated surgically (HR 0.47, 95%CI 0.29–0.77, P = 0.003) had significantly better outcomes.

Conclusions

Klatskin tumors are rare and have a very poor prognosis with low survival rate. Among these tumors, extrahepatic and surgically treated tumors tend to have better outcomes.

### Biliary strictures: endoscopic assessment and management [^111fFbLm]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Biliary strictures (BS) are an everyday challenge in gastrointestinal clinical practice. The most pertinent and critical differentiation is between benign and malignant aetiology. This differentiation often poses a significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenge and extensive investigative workup may be required.

Most BS are of malignant aetiology — either pancreatic adenocarcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) or peri-ampullary cancer — and these tend to present at an advanced stage (rendering them unresectable). Less common malignant causes may include gallbladder cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, lymphoproliferative and metastatic disease. Up to one-third of BS are benign. Benign causes include gallstones (Mirizzi's syndrome or inflammatory stricture) chronic pancreatitis, primary scelrosing cholangitis (PSC), IgG4-related sclerosing cholangitis (IgG4-SC), iatrogenic bile duct injury (following cholecystectomy), post-transplant strictures and other less common conditions.

A recent study found 13.6% of patients undergoing surgical resection for a suspected Klatskin tumour had benign disease. Such major surgery is associated with appreciable morbidity and not insignificant morbidity. Therefore, confirming the diagnosis before surgery is preferable.

In the rest of this article, we will discuss the role of endoscopy in the evaluation and management of BS.

Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography

Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) plays an important role in the management of BS and it is commonly performed to alleviate symptoms including jaundice and cholangitis.

Cholangiography can provide morphological characterisation and information for BS including location, extent, irregularity and shouldering but even in expert hands cholangiography alone is an unreliable means to differentiate between PSC, IgG4-SC and hilar CCA.

Concurrent tissue sampling of BS can be achieved by biliary brush cytology or intraductal biliary biopsy. Biliary brushings is the most commonly performed tissue diagnostic technique performed for BS.

A 2015 meta-analysis of nine studies found that the sensitivity of brush cytology and intraductal biopsy in diagnosing malignant BS were 45% and 48%, respectively. A combination of both only modestly increased the sensitivity to 59.4%. Both techniques are almost 100% specific.

### Biliary manifestation of Erdheim-Chester disease mimicking Klatskin's carcinoma [^114uk24e]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Erdheim-Chester disease (ECD) is a rare non-Langerhans form of histiocytosis, characterized by infiltration of foamy, lipid-laden histiocytes often affecting the lower extremities and resulting in symmetrical osteosclerosis. Internal organs involved include the lung and the kidneys, reflecting progressive disseminated granulomatous infiltration. Progression may be fatal, especially in cases of systemic extraosseous involvement. Here, we report a patient with elevated serum levels of liver enzymes due to intra- and extrahepatic bile duct stenoses. The patient's past medical history was remarkable for ECD, since 1 yr before he had undergone surgery for a pituitary lesion in our neurosurgical department revealing the typical histological and immunohistochemical criteria of ECD. Because no biliary manifestation of ECD had been described so far in the literature, surgery of suspected bile duct carcinoma was performed unraveling an unresectable tumor of the hilar region. Surprisingly, histologic examination of intraoperative biopsy specimens failed to demonstrate malignancy but rather revealed another xanthogranulomatous lesion embedded in extended periductal fibrosis as is typically described in extrahepatic parenchymal organ manifestation of ECD. Other possible reasons for cholestatic liver disease were excluded. Secondary cholestasis was overcome by endoscopic dilatation and biliary stenting with stents being exchanged every 3 months. During follow-up for 7 yr we have observed only a slight increase of the hilar stenosis so far. This is the first report describing biliary manifestation of ECD. Even though ECD is a rare cause of cholestasis, it should be considered in patients with this disorder in the setting of multiorgan manifestation.

### Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography-guided unilateral endoscopic stent placement for Klatskin tumors [^117D9bbE]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Advanced and incurable Klatskin tumors of Bismuth-type III and IV cause obstructive jaundice. Palliation of patients with Klatskin tumors is usually carried out by bilateral endoscopic stent placement. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC) in such patients is associated with a comparatively high morbidity and mortality mainly due to postprocedure bacterial cholangitis. To reduce ERC-related complications the outcome of replacing ERC with magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) was investigated. Subsequently, unilateral contrast injection and stent placement were performed, thus avoiding bilateral contrast injection and stent insertion.

Methods

Patients thought to have a Klatskin tumor underwent clinical evaluation, laboratory, and noninvasive imaging studies before ERC. Patients were enrolled in this feasibility study if investigators agreed with the clinical diagnosis of an advanced and incurable Klatskin tumor. MRCP images were used to determine the predominate ductal drainage for the liver segments thus directing stent placement. Based on these findings, unilateral ERC and subsequent unilateral stent placement were performed. Antibiotics were not given before ERC. Amsterdam-type stents (10F) were placed and replaced routinely at 2 months. In cases of earlier occlusion, the stents were replaced immediately.

Results

Thirty-five patients underwent MRCP, ERC, and unilateral stent deployment. Two further patients enrolled after MRCP were withdrawn because ERC could not be carried out. In 35 patients with unilateral stents bilirubin levels decreased (18.9 ± 6.3 mg/dL to 3.2 ± 2.3 mg/dL) and jaundice resolved in 86%. After first stent deployment, post-ERC bacterial cholangitis occurred in 6% (2 of 35) of patients.

Conclusions

This new method of MRCP-guided endoscopic unilateral stent placement could reduce ERC-related complications caused by initial stent deployment. The results of this study justify a randomized prospective comparative trial.

The patient awakened uneventfully in the recovery unit and was transferred to the ward. The next day she experienced some nausea and vomiting, which was successfully treated with anti-emetics. No pain medication was required. Venous sampling showed a mild increase in transaminases (AST from 32 to 53 U/L, ALT from 26 to 52 U/L) with no signs for cholestasis (bilirubin 17 μmol/L). MRI(-DWI) 1 day post-IRE showed an edematous ablation zone surrounding the Wallstent which was present in the same location. No complications to the blood vessels or bile ducts were noticed (Fig. 1 F). On the 4th day post-IRE, the patient was discharged in good clinical condition. Further recovery was uneventful. Four months later, follow-up ceCT showed no local tumor progression or metastatic disease, also no stent complications were noticed. At six, 9 months, and 1-year follow-up, ceCT still showed no local tumor progression or metastatic disease (Fig. 1 G, H). She currently remains in follow-up.

### Improved outcome of resection of hilar cholangiocarcinoma (Klatskin tumor) [^115BU9Qd]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Treatment of hilar cholangiocarcinoma (Klatskin tumors) has changed in many aspects. A more extensive surgical approach, as proposed by Japanese surgeons, has been applied in our center over the last 5 years; it combines hilar resection with partial hepatectomy for most tumors. The aim of this study was to assess the outcome of a 15-year evolution in the surgical treatment of Klatskin tumors.

Methods

A total of 99 consecutive patients underwent resection for hilar cholangiocarcinoma in three 5-year time periods: periods 1 (1988–1993; n = 45), 2 (1993–1998; n = 25), and 3 (1998–2003; n = 29). Outcome was evaluated by assessment of completeness of resection, postoperative morbidity and mortality, and survival.

Results

The proportion of margin negative resections increased significantly from 13% in period 1 to 59% in period 3 (P < .05). Two-year survival increased significantly from 33% ± 7% and 39% ± 10% in periods 1 and 2 to 60% ± 11% in period 3 (P < .05). Postoperative morbidity and mortality were considerable but did not increase with this changed surgical strategy (68% and 10%, respectively, in period 3). Lymph node metastasis was, next to period of resection, also associated with survival in univariate analysis.

Conclusions

Mainly in the last 5-year period (1998–2003), when the Japanese surgical approach was followed, more hilar resections were combined with partial liver resections that included segments 1 and 4, thus leading to more R0 resections. This, together with a decrease in lymph node metastases, resulted in improved survival without significantly affecting postoperative morbidity or mortality.

### Inflammation and carcinogenesis of the biliary tract: update on endoscopic treatment [^111nBKHx]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2009). Low credibility.

Both diagnosis and treatment of cholangiocarcinoma are suboptimal. From the former standpoint, fluorescence in situ hybridization, direct cholangioscopy, endocystoscopy, and optical coherence tomography are just a few of the myriad technologies being studied or employed to improve diagnostic yield. From the latter standpoint, most series suggest that fewer than 1 third of patients are resectable for cure, although liver transplantation has increasingly been used in a subset of cholangiocarcinoma patients with extrahepatic disease. Palliation has included chemotherapy which is of dubious value in most series. Instead, a majority of therapies have addressed mechanisms to improve biliary drainage to delay and preclude hepatic failure and minimize the risk of cholangitis. Although the latter has been accomplished with surgery and attempted with external beam irradiation and brachytherapy, percutaneous and/or endoscopic drainage are the most commonly employed methods in widespread use. There are prospective, randomized studies that suggest that bilateral stenting is associated with improved outcomes in bifurcation lesions if plastic stents are placed, that percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage is more successful than endoscopic stenting in Klatskin tumors, that self-expandable biliary stents have prolonged patency compared with plastic prostheses, and that, if approached with computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging guidance to preclude contamination of the contralateral undrained system, outcomes are comparable in patients treated with unilateral as opposed to bilateral self-expandable metal stents. There is a single prospective, randomized study suggesting that patients treated with endoscopic or percutaneous stenting in conjunction with photodynamic therapy have prolonged survival compared with stent placement alone.

### Feasibility assessment of robotic major hepatectomy and bile duct resection in Klatskin type IIIB tumor with concomitant gallbladder cancer [^114QKzHp]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Radical resection is the only curative treatment for perihilar cholangiocarcinoma (Klatskin tumor), the most common type of bile duct cancer. 1,2 Because Klatskin tumors require major hepatectomy including segment 1, extensive lymphadenectomy, and bile duct reconstruction, laparoscopic surgery has technical challenges, especially with small and multiple bile ducts. 2–5 The robotic platform has great freedom of movement, making it effective for dissection and suturing in minimally invasive Klatskin tumor resection. 2,3,6 However, few cases have been reported, prompting this video demonstration.

Methods

A 74-year-old woman was referred to surgery after biliary drainage due to obstructive jaundice. Adenocarcinoma was diagnosed via endobiliary brushing, with magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography (CT) showing a polypoid mass in the gallbladder and a 3-cm enhancing mass in the perihilar area. No signs of distant metastasis were present. Thus, robotic left hepatectomy including segment 1, partial hepatectomy of segment 5, and bile duct resection were performed (see video).

Results

The total operative time was 419 min, with an estimated blood loss of 300 ml. Computed tomography on postoperative day 5 showed no abnormal findings, and the patient was discharged on postoperative day 10 without complications. The final pathologic results confirmed the double primary adenocarcinomas with clear resection margins of 6.4 cm and 3.8 cm, respectively, and 11 lymph nodes all were negative for malignancy.

Conclusions

This case exemplifies the safety and effectiveness of robotic surgery for Klatskin tumors, even with concomitant gallbladder cancer, and demonstrates the benefits and potential of this technique in complex surgical procedures.

### Endoscopic treatment of unresectable perihilar cholangiocarcinoma: beyond biliary drainage [^112ZLUcN]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Perihilar cholangiocarcinoma (PHCC), also known as Klatskin tumor, refers to cholangiocarcinoma located between the second-order bile ducts and the junction of the cystic duct. It represents the most prevalent form of cholangiocarcinoma, accounting for 40%–60% of all cases. Common classification systems for PHCC include Bismuth-Corlette, AJCC, Blumgart T-staging, and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) T-staging systems. The Bismuth-Corlette classification emphasizes the tumor's location and extent along the bile duct system. It is primarily used for preliminary endoscopic diagnosis, staging, and guiding surgical planning, and is widely applied to direct localized treatment during endoscopy. However, it lacks information on vascular invasion, metastasis, and liver lobe atrophy, which limits its predictive capability concerning resectability and prognosis, (Figure 1). The Blumgart T-staging system classifies tumors based on the extent of invasion, portal vein involvement, and ipsilateral liver lobe atrophy, providing better predictive validity for resectability and the likelihood of achieving R0 resection. Nonetheless, it does not consider lymph nodes or distant metastases, which limits its prognostic value. In 2001, the MSKCC proposed a T-staging system that integrates local tumor factors, including portal vein involvement and liver lobe atrophy, demonstrating good predictive value for resectability. The AJCC staging system is based on pathological findings, including vascular invasion, lymph node involvement, and distant metastases, providing improved prognostic value and guidance for postoperative treatment. –

### Liver biopsy [^115w41nJ]. Hepatology (2009). Medium credibility.

Cholangiocarcinoma — biopsy decisions should consider resectability and transplant scenarios: This lesion typically occurs in the presence of chronic biliary tract disease and usually presents as a solitary lesion at the biliary hilum or within hepatic parenchyma; the decision to biopsy a solitary lesion may be governed by whether surgical resection is feasible, and if not, or if liver transplantation is a possibility, the lesion should be biopsied under image guidance, with enlarged porta hepatis or other upper abdominal lymph nodes also biopsied as appropriate; when cross-sectional imaging and tumor markers cannot distinguish rare primary hepatic tumors from other lesions, image-guided biopsy is necessary to confirm the diagnosis.

### Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and endoscopic endoprosthesis insertion in patients with Klatskin tumors… [^113ivQ36]. JAMA Network (1998). Excellent credibility.

Fifty-five consecutive patients with Klatskin tumors diagnosed through typical cholangiographic and computed tomographic findings. Intervention Standard ERCP with endoscopic stenting technique was employed. Once the diagnosis of Klatskin tumor was confirmed on cholangiogram, endoscopic stenting was performed to bypass the stricture. Multiple stents were inserted if necessary to ensure adequate biliary drainage. ENDOSCOPIC retrograde cholangiopancreatography is frequently used in the management of patients with malignant hilar biliary obstruction that includes Klatskin tumor. As patients often present with obstructive jaundice, diagnostic ERCP is frequently performed as part of the initial investigation. In addition, endoscopic endoprostheses are often inserted either as preoperative drainage for those considered to have resectable disease, or as a palliative treatment for those considered unsuitable for curative resection.

Among these 55 patients, 37 were considered unsuitable for resection on the basis of significant medical illness or extensive tumor involvement as defined by cholangiography, computed tomography, or angiography. In the other 18 patients, ERCP and attempted endoscopic stenting were performed as preoperative initial investigation and biliary drainage. Stent patency was regularly assessed with use of both clinical and biochemical parameters. Stent blockage was suspected whenever increase in jaundice or acute cholangitis occurred or deterioration of liver function was evident in the blood biochemistry test results. Stent blockage was then confirmed with endoscopic examination. Of the 55 patients with Klatskin tumors who underwent ERCP, a cholangiography was performed on 53 patients. Two patients for whom cannulation of the bile duct had failed because of anatomical and technical reasons underwent percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography and drainage.

Endoprosthesis insertion was not attempted in 4 patients after cholangiography. In the third patient the endoscopic procedure was complicated by severe necrotizing pancreatitis and required repeated laparotomy for drainage and necrosectomy. He finally died of multiorgan failure. The 30-day mortality rate was 18%. Complete follow-up was achieved in all patients. The median survival time for all patients was 19 weeks from the first attempted drainage procedure. The causes of death were cachexia, biliary sepsis, postpapillotomy pancreatitis, and postoperative liver failure.

### Best options for preoperative biliary drainage in patients with Klatskin tumors [^114imxyT]. Surgical Endoscopy (2017). Low credibility.

Operative treatment combined with PBD has been established as a safe management strategy for Klatskin tumors. However, controversy exists regarding the preferred technique for PBD among percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD), endoscopic biliary stenting (EBS), and endoscopic nasobiliary drainage (ENBD). This study aimed to identify the best technique for preoperative biliary drainage (PBD) in Klatskin tumor patients.

Methods

This study evaluated 98 Klatskin tumor patients who underwent PBD prior to operation with a curative aim between 2005 and 2012. The PTBD, EBS, and ENBD groups included 43, 42, and 13 patients, respectively. Baseline characteristics, technical success rate, complications of PBD, and surgical outcomes were compared.

Results

Initial technical success rates (97.3%, PTBD; 90.2%, endoscopic methods, including EBS and ENBD) and mean duration until biliary decompression (31.0, PTBD; 28.7, EBS; 35.8 days, ENBD) were not significantly different between the groups. Total frequency of complications did not significantly differ between the EBS group (42.9%) and the PTBD (27.9%, p = 0.149) and ENBD (15.4%, p = 0.072) groups. The ENBD group showed a significantly higher rate of conversion to other methods (76.9%) than the PTBD (4.7%, p < 0.0001) and EBS (35.7%, p = 0.009) groups.

Conclusions

PTBD, EBS, and ENBD showed comparable results regarding initial technical success rates, complication rates, and surgical outcomes. As Klatskin tumor patients must undergo PBD prior to 3 weeks before surgery, PTBD and ENBD are uncomfortable and disadvantageous in terms of compliance. EBS was the most suitable method for initial PBD in terms of compliance among Klatskin tumor patients.

### Robotic Klatskin type 3A resection with biliary reconstruction: description of surgical technique and outcomes of initial series [^116Q1QpR]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Minimally invasive resection for perihilar cholangiocarcinoma is an emerging technique that requires both mastery in minimally invasive liver resection and biliary reconstruction. Due to technical difficulties in biliovascular dissection, radical portal lymphadenectomy and the need for fine suturing during bilioenteric anastomosis, this type of resection is generally not performed laparoscopically, even at high-volume, liver-surgery centers. 1–3 In modern literature, a detailed, operative description of robotic technique for this operation with outcome data is lacking. This video article demonstrates a pure robotic Klatskin Type 3A resection with clinical outcomes of our initial series.

Video

A 77-year-old man presented with jaundice and findings of bilateral, intrahepatic, ductal dilation (Right > Left). Radiological imaging showed a type 3A Klatskin tumor with associated thrombosis of the right, anterior portal vein. A further endoscopic evaluation with cholangioscopy confirmed a high-grade Bismuth 3A biliary malignant stricture. Endoscopic drainage was achieved with placement of two, 7-French, 15-cm, plastic, endobiliary stents. A 3-D anatomical liver reconstruction showed a 2-cm mass located in the area of right, anterior, sectoral, Glissonean pedicle with standardized, future, liver-remnant (left hepatic lobe) volume of 50%. The patient was placed supine on the operating table. General endotracheal anesthesia was administered. After exclusion of metastatic peritoneal disease with diagnostic laparoscopy, cholecystectomy and systematic radical portal lymphadenectomy were first completed with a goal to obtain more than six lymph nodes. After appropriate portal lymphadenectomy, the common bile duct was isolated and transected at the level of pancreatic head. The plastic, endobiliary stents were removed, and a distal common bile duct margin was sent for a frozen-section examination to rule out distal extension of the cholangiocarcinoma. A small, accessory, right, hepatic artery lateral to the main portal vein was ligated with locking clips and removed together with the adjacent nodes and lymphatic bearing tissues. The intrapancreatic portion of the distal common bile duct was suture closed once the distal common bile duct margin was confirmed to be negative for neoplasia by the frozen-section examination. The proximal bile-duct dissection commenced cephalad toward the hilar bifurcation. Once the biliary bifurcation has been adequately dissected and detached from the hilar plate, the distal, left, hepatic duct was then transected near the base of the umbilical fissure to gain an R-0 resection margin. A second frozen-section specimen was obtained from the left, hepatic duct cut edge to ensure an absence of infiltrating tumor cells on the future, bile-duct remnant side. Division of short, hepatic veins off the inferior vena cava (IVC) were next completed. Once the line of hepatic-parenchymal transection was confirmed by using indocyanine green administration, the right hepatic artery and portal vein were ligated and clipped. The liver, parenchymal transection began with a crush-clamp technique utilizing robotic, fenestrated bipolar forceps and a vessel-sealing device. Preservation of the middle hepatic vein is always the preferred technique to avoid congestion of the left medial sector of the liver. The entire right hepatic lobe and the caudate lobe were removed en bloc. A large, Makuuchi ligament was isolated and divided by using a robotic, vascular-load stapler once the liver is open-booked. Finally, the root of the right hepatic vein was exposed and transected flush to the IVC by using another load of robotic vascular stapler. The biliary reconstruction then began by creating a 60-cm, roux limb for a hepaticojejunostomy bilioenteric anastomosis. A side-to-side, stapled jejunojejunostomy was created by using two applications for robotic 45-mm, blue load staplers. The common enterotomy was closed with running barbed sutures. The roux limb was then transposed retrocolically toward the porta hepatis. A single end-to-side hepaticojejunostomy anastomosis was created with running absorbable 4–0 barbed sutures. Finally, a closed suction abdominal drain was placed before closing.

Results

The operative time was approximately 8 hours with 150 mL of blood loss. The postoperative course was unremarkable. The final pathology report confirmed a moderately differentiated perihilar cholangiocarcinoma with negative resection margins. Ten lymph nodes were harvested. No nodal metastasis or lymphovascular invasion was found. Since 2021, we have undertaken robotic resection of Klatskin 3A tumor in four patients with a median age of 70 years. All patients presented with jaundice, and they mainly underwent preoperative biliary drainage using ERCP. The median operative duration was 508 minutes with estimated blood loss of 150 ml. R-0 resection margins were obtained in all patients. One patient suffered from postoperative complications requiring treatment of line sepsis using intravenous antibiotics. We did not find a 90-day mortality in this series. At a median follow-up period of 15 months, all of the patients were alive without any evidence of disease recurrence.

Conclusions

Robotic resection of Type 3A Klatskin tumor is safe and feasible with appropriate experience in robotic hepatobiliary surgery, as demonstrated in this video article.

### Robotic extrahepatic biliary resection with roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy for type 2 Klatskin tumor [^112GnGv4]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite the widespread of laparoscopic technique in hepatobiliary tumor resection, nearly all Klatskin tumor resection is undertaken using an open approach (Marino et al. in Updates Surg 72(3):911–912. https://doi.org/10.1007/s13304-020-00777-8; Sucandy et al. in Am Surg, 2020. https://doi.org/10.1177/0003134820956336, Am Surg, 2020;86(3):200–207; Luberice et al. in HPB (Oxford), 2020. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hpb.2020.10.008; Ciria et al. in J Hepatobiliary Pancreat Sci, 2020. https://doi.org/10.1002/jhbp.869; Chong and Choi in J Gastrointest Surg 23(9):1947–19488, 2019. https://doi.org/10.1007/s11605-019-04242-9). A minimally invasive approach for malignant extrahepatic biliary resection is rarely used due to technical complexity and concerns of oncological inferiority. In the United States, robotic technique for Klatskin tumor resection has not been adequately described. This video described our technique of robotic extrahepatic biliary resection with Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy (HJ) for type 2 Klatskin tumor.

Methods

A 77-year-old man presented with obstructive jaundice. Endobiliary brushing confirmed adenocarcinoma. MRI/MRCP showed a focal lesion at the cystic duct entrance into the common hepatic duct, extending cephalad toward the biliary bifurcation. No obvious vascular invasion was identified on the CT scan.

Results

The operation was undertaken using a six-port technique. Systematic portal dissection was undertaken to identify the bile duct at the level of the pancreas up toward the hepatic hilum. A partial Kocher maneuver was performed to expose the area dorsal to the distal common bile duct, which allows for a more thorough lymphadenectomy and facilitates creation of a later tension-free hepaticojejunostomy. The distal common bile duct was transected, and the distal margin was sent for frozen section. The right hepatic artery coursing posterior to the common hepatic duct was skeletonized and preserved. Biliary duct bifurcation was transected at the level of the right and left duct, removing the cancer completely. Portal lymphadenectomy was completed as part of oncological staging and treatment. A total of eight lymph nodes were removed and all confirmed to be nonneoplastic on the final pathology report. For the purpose of the biliary reconstruction, a standard side-to-side stapled jejunojejunostomy was created. A jejunal mesenteric defect was closed to prevent a future internal herniation. A 60-cm Roux limb was transposed antecolically for the Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy. A running technique was used to create a watertight end-to-side bilioenteric anastomosis, using 3–0 barbed sutures, 6 inches in length. A closed suction drain was placed before closing. Pathology report confirmed intraductal papillary adenocarcinoma with R-0 resection margins (proximal, distal, and radial margin). Perineural invasion was present; however, lymphovascular invasion was not identified. Total operative time was 240 minutes with 75 mL of estimated blood loss. The postoperative recovery was uneventful. One-year follow-up showed no evidence of disease recurrence or HJ anastomotic stricture.

Conclusions

This video demonstrates a safe and feasible application of the robotic platform in extrahepatic bile duct cancer resection requiring fine biliary reconstruction.

### Detection of Klatskin's tumor in extrahepatic bile duct strictures using delayed 18F-FDG PET / CT: preliminary results for 22 patient studies [^113H7doJ]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Detection of cholangiocarcinoma in extrahepatic bile duct strictures is a continuing challenge in clinical practice because brush cytology taken at endoscopic retrograde cholangiography has an average sensitivity of 50%. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of dual-modality PET/CT using (18)F-FDG for noninvasive differentiation of extrahepatic bile duct strictures.

Methods

Twenty-two PET/CT studies were performed on 20 patients (10 women, 10 men; mean age ± SD, 63 ± 14 y) with extrahepatic bile duct strictures on endoscopic retrograde cholangiography. PET imaging was started 101 ± 22 min after injection of 369 ± 48 MBq of 18F-FDG. Blood glucose was 100 ± 20 mg/dL. PET images were reconstructed iteratively with attenuation correction based on a rescaling of the CT image. CT was performed within 1 min before the PET study, with the patient in the same position. CT was used to place a volume of interest 5 cm in diameter at the liver hilus for quantitative evaluation of PET images by means of standardized uptake values (SUVs).

Results

Final diagnosis was histologically proven cholangiocarcinoma in 14 cases and benign causes of strictures in 8 cases without evidence of malignancy during a follow-up of 18 ± 3 mo. All patients with cholangiocarcinoma presented with focal increased uptake in the liver hilus with an SUV of 6.8 ± 3.3 (range, 3.9–15.8), compared with 2.9 ± 0.3 (range, 2.5–3.3) in patients with benign causes of strictures (P = 0.003). There was a clear cutoff SUV of 3.6 for detection of malignancy in the liver hilus.

Conclusion

18F-FDG PET/CT provided high accuracy for noninvasive detection of perihilar cholangiocarcinoma in extrahepatic bile duct strictures.

### Current concepts in the biopsy of musculoskeletal tumors: AAOS exhibit selection [^116Sjujg]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2015). Low credibility.

Background

A musculoskeletal tumor biopsy can involve fine needle aspiration, core needle biopsy, or incisional biopsy. Controversy regarding the diagnostic yield of these biopsy techniques continues. The purpose of this article is to summarize the current concepts in the biopsy of musculoskeletal tumors.

Methods

We performed a literature review of clinical articles reporting on the biopsy of bone and soft-tissue primary tumors. Clinical articles were excluded on the basis on abstract content if they represented case reports, review or opinion articles, or technique descriptions. Eighteen of the thirty-nine articles that remained were excluded because the results did not indicate the diagnostic accuracy of the various biopsy techniques. Thus, twenty-one articles with diagnostic data on the biopsy of bone and soft-tissue tumors were included in this review.

Results

Core needle biopsy appeared to be more accurate than fine needle aspiration, and incisional biopsy appeared to be more accurate than both of these techniques, but the differences did not reach significance. Incisional biopsy was more expensive than the percutaneous biopsy methods. In deep musculoskeletal tumors, incorporation of ultrasonography or computed tomography for guidance is easy and safe and can be useful for increasing the accuracy of the biopsy. Advantages of a percutaneous technique compared with an incisional one are the low risk of contamination and the minimally invasive nature. Certain anatomic locations and histologic types were associated with diagnostic difficulty. Vertebral tumors had the lowest diagnostic accuracy regardless of the biopsy technique. Myxoid, infection, and round cell histologies were associated with the lowest diagnostic accuracy.

Conclusions

The current literature has not clarified the optimal biopsy technique for the diagnosis of bone and soft-tissue tumors. However, core needle biopsy is usually preferable to incisional biopsy because of the low risk of contamination and the low cost. In addition, the use of imaging guidance increases the diagnostic accuracy of musculoskeletal biopsies and reduces the risk of complications. If the result of a percutaneous biopsy is nondiagnostic, a small incisional biopsy should be performed.

### Efficacy and safety of endoscopic nasobiliary drainage versus percutaneous transhepatic cholangial drainage in the treatment of advanced hilar cholangiocarcinoma: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113Amcn5]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hilar cholangiocarcinoma (HCCA), a highly aggressive malignant tumor of the digestive system, is also known as Klatskin tumor after its detailed description by Klatskin in 1965. Representing 60%-70% of all intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary tract tumors, HCCA carries a grim prognosis, with a median survival time of less than 6 months for patients without radical resection.

The disease's hallmark is bile duct obstruction, leading to increased pressure, bile capillary expansion, and reversed bile flow into the bloodstream. This can result in liver failure, biliary tract infections, sepsis, and septic shock, the primary causes of death in HCCA patients.

Effective biliary drainage is crucial for managing HCCA. It promotes the excretion of metabolic waste and toxins, reduces liver cell damage, and ultimately improves quality of life and prolongs survival. Two minimally invasive biliary drainage methods are commonly employed: endoscopic nasobiliary drainage (ENBD) and percutaneous transhepatic cholangial drainage (PTCD).

PTCD involves placing a puncture needle under ultrasound or X-ray guidance through the skin into the bile duct above the obstruction site to drain bile externally. This approach offers several advantages: simplicity, low technical requirements, ease of implementation in primary hospitals, avoidance of general anesthesia, and fewer surgical contraindications. However, PTCD also presents limitations, including the need for prolonged drainage tube placement, potential for infection, and patient discomfort.

ENBD, an endoscopic technique based on Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), involves inserting a nasobiliary drainage tube into the common bile duct and guiding it through the duodenum, stomach, esophagus, pharynx, and throat, ultimately exiting through the nose. This method facilitates both endoscopic diagnosis and treatment.

While PTCD was once the preferred biliary drainage method for advanced HCCA, ENBD has emerged as a viable alternative with the advancements in endoscopic technology. Both methods aim to relieve biliary obstruction and reduce pressure, but their effectiveness and impact on patient prognosis remain unclear.

This meta-analysis aims to evaluate and compare the efficacy and safety of PTCD and ENBD in treating HCCA by synthesizing data from published clinical studies. Our goal is to provide robust evidence-based guidance for clinicians in selecting the most appropriate minimally invasive biliary drainage method for their HCCA patients.

### Bone cancer, version 2.2025, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^115LrD37]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

NCCN Bone Cancer biopsy — diagnostic approach and safety: Open biopsy is the most accurate method because of larger sample size, and rates of complications, particularly altered treatment and outcomes, are considerably higher with open biopsy, whereas core needle biopsy is highly diagnostic with accuracy rates ranging from 88% to 96% when adequate samples are obtained. The guidelines recommend core needle or open biopsy to confirm the diagnosis of primary bone tumor prior to any surgical procedure or fixation of primary site, and biopsy should be performed at a center that will provide definitive treatment for patients with a suspected primary malignant bone tumor. In a multicenter review of 597 patients with musculoskeletal tumors, alteration of the treatment plan was encountered in 19% of patients and unnecessary amputation was performed in 18 patients. Both core needle and open biopsy techniques are associated with risk of local tumor recurrence if the scar is not removed en bloc during the tumor resection, and the risk of tumor seeding is less with core needle biopsy; appropriate communication between the surgeon, musculoskeletal or interventional radiologist, and bone pathologist is critical in planning the biopsy route. In the case of children, consultation with a pediatric oncologist is recommended, and it is essential to select the biopsy route in collaboration with the surgeon so the biopsy tract lies within the planned resection bed and can be resected with the same wide margins as the primary tumor during surgery; although the risk of tumor seeding is not significant with FNA biopsy, it is not suitable for the diagnosis of primary lesions since the diagnostic accuracy of FNA is less than that of core needle biopsy.

Biopsy — percutaneous biopsy (core needle) or incisional (open) biopsy are the two techniques historically used in musculoskeletal lesions, and core needle biopsy is highly diagnostic with accuracy rates ranging from 88% to 96% when adequate samples are obtained. The guidelines recommend core needle or open biopsy to confirm the diagnosis of primary bone tumor prior to any surgical procedure or fixation of primary site, and biopsy should be performed at a center that will provide definitive treatment for patients with a suspected primary malignant bone tumor.

### Endoscopic radiofrequency ablation for palliative treatment of hilar cholangiocarcinoma [^111RXk3F]. VideoGIE (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical cases

We describe 3 patients with a diagnosis of perihilar CCA who underwent endoscopic RFA with palliative intent. The first patient was a 58-year-old woman with a Bismuth type-IV tumor with vascular invasion, for which systemic chemotherapy was recommended. Because of the worsening of jaundice and cholestasis, ERCP with a single-operator cholangioscope (Spyglass DS II, Boston Scientific) was performed, confirming the presence of a hilar stricture with irregular dilated blood vessels — "tumor vessels" with involvement of the right and left hepatic duct (Fig. 1 A) — and visual impression of malignancy. The second patient, a 72-year-old-man with a Bismuth type-I Klatskin tumor, was considered inoperable because of comorbidities and was recommended systemic chemotherapy; cholangioscopy was performed because of worsening jaundice and confirmed a stricture at the level of the common hepatic duct (Fig. 2 A). The last patient was a 53-year-old man with an unresectable Bismuth type-IV cholangiocarcinoma who was recommended palliative chemotherapy. ERCP with a single-operator cholangioscope was performed because of jaundice and pruritus and confirmed a hilar stricture with "tumor vessels" extending to the right and left intrahepatic ducts (Fig. 3).

### Treatment of biliary obstruction in selected patients by endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS)-guided transluminal biliary drainage [^115Ejsmn]. Endoscopy (2007). Low credibility.

Background and Study Aims

Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)-guided implantation of a biliary endoprosthesis or stent is the gold standard treatment for biliary obstructions. When the papilla cannot be traversed because there is pyloric or duodenal stenosis, or the catheter cannot be introduced, or because of previous gastrointestinal surgery (Billroth II gastric resection, Whipple procedure, gastrectomy with Roux-en-Y reconstruction), the alternative treatment is considered to be percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography and drainage (PTCD). The aim of the study was to investigate the further alternative of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided transgastric or transjejunal biliary drainage where PTCD failed or was declined, and particularly, the feasibility and outcome of this option.

Patients and Methods

Over 3 years all appropriate consecutive patients (as defined above) were enrolled in this prospective, observational, single-center, case series study, and patient and intervention data were recorded. Feasibility was characterized by success rate (regression of cholestasis), and outcomes by complication rate, mortality, and follow-up findings.

Results

Between November 2002 and December 2005, eight patients (in 10 interventions) underwent this new biliary drainage procedure. The routes were transesophageal (n = 1), transgastric (n = 4), and transjejunal (n = 3, including a rendezvous technique with ERCP [n = 1]). The indications were cholestasis, arising from recurrent tumor growth (n = 5, 62.5%), that included gastric carcinoma after previous gastrectomy (n = 4) and a periampullary carcinoma after previous Whipple procedure (n = 1); arising from Klatskin tumor (n = 2, 25%); and from benign stenosis of a hepaticojejunostomy (n = 1, 12.5%). Five patients (62.5%) received a metal stent, and three (37.5%) had a plastic prosthesis (8.5-Fr double-pigtail). The technical success rate was 90% (9/10) and the clinical success rate was 88.9% (8/9). There was only one case of cholangitis (12.5%) and slight postinterventional pain, but no severe complications such as bleeding or perforation, and no mortality. During follow-up (range 4 weeks to 3 years) re-interventions were needed in two patients (20%) because of increasing cholestasis; these resulted in technical success and clinical improvement.

Conclusion

EUS-guided transgastric or transjejunal biliary drainage is a reasonable, feasible and encouraging treatment option in selected patients as indicated, with a low peri-interventional risk. It broadens the therapeutic spectrum but still needs further evaluation and follow-up investigation.

### Robotic resection of type IV perihilar cholangiocarcinoma. moving toward the most complex minimally invasive technique in biliary cancer surgery [^111QZSFB]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Minimally invasive techniques are not being adopted in biliary cancer surgery for perihilar cholangiocarcinoma (Klatskin tumor) because of the technical complexity of tumor extirpation, the need for fine hepaticojejunostomy biliary reconstructions, and concerns about oncological radicality that could affect long-term survival. Although technical reports have been published for resections of type I-III Klatskin tumors using robotic approaches in the last 5 years, technical descriptions of resections of type IV Klatskin tumors are very limited in the literature. 1–5 This is because type IV perihilar cholangiocarcinoma involves secondary biliary/hepatic ducts above the hilar plate bilaterally, requiring a very difficult resection, followed by more than one fine hepaticojejunostomy anastomoses. Thus, this operation is undertaken via an unpopular laparoscopic method. The emergence of minimally invasive robotic techniques, with their technical advantages over laparoscopy enables complex resections to be completed. Herein, we describe an application of a minimally invasive robotic biliary surgery technique for resection of type IV perihilar cholangiocarcinoma.

Methods

A 71-year-old otherwise healthy man initially presented to his medical oncologist with pruritus, obstructive jaundice, and weight loss. Workup, including computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging scans, endoscopic ultrasonography, biliary endoscopy, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, and positron-emitting tomography, revealed Bismuth-Corlette type IV perihilar cholangiocarcinoma without any evidence of extrahepatic disease. Preoperative drainage using bilateral endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography stenting was completed with normalization of his liver function panel. The patient had undergone 1 year of systemic chemoimmunotherapy before the surgical referral. He showed no signs of disease progression and tolerable systemic side effects. The operative plan included robotic extended left hepatectomy en-bloc with caudate lobectomy, extrahepatic biliary resection, radical portal lymphadenectomy, and Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy. The Pringle maneuver was not used in this operation because of the relatively hemostatic nature of the parenchymal division. However, isolated temporary vascular clamping of the main portal vein for 10 minutes was undertaken using a vascular bulldog clamp to facilitate and achieve left portal vein division, which was densely adherent to the hilar plate. 3–0 barbed permanent sutures were used for the bile duct closure and jejunojejunostomy anastomosis. 4–0 barbed absorbable sutures and 5–0 PDS sutures were used for the hepaticojejunostomy anastomoses.

Results

The operation was completed uneventfully without intraoperative or postoperative complications. The patient's recovery in the hospital was uneventful, and he was successfully discharged on postoperative day 7 with his abdominal drain removed before hospital discharge. The patient reported no complications during office follow-ups. At 1 year after resection, he has no evidence of disease.

Conclusion

The application of a robotic technique is safe and feasible for the treatment of Bismuth-Corlette type IV perihilar cholangiocarcinoma with excellent short-term outcomes. We believe that, with experienced robotic hepatobiliary surgeons and well-selected patients, this most complex biliary cancer resection will find surgical refinements and future utilization.

### Penile metastasis from primary cholangiocarcinoma: the first case report [^1169FFyd]. BMC Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is an uncommon and aggressive malignancy that originates in the bile duct epithelium and is associated with very poor prognosis. The incidence and risk factors of CCA vary in different regions of the world. The highest incidence is reported in the north-eastern part of Thailand. The major risk factor for CCA in this area is Opisthorchis viverrini infection, whereas Clonorchis sinensis is associated with CCA in Korea and China. Other risk factors for CCA are primary sclerosing cholangitis; biliary-duct cysts; hepatolithiasis; and conditions such as hepatitis B infection, hepatitis C infection, obesity, chronic non-alcoholic liver disease, and cirrhosis. The incidence of CCA peaks during the sixth decade of life and shows a slight male predominance. Tumours most frequently occur at the confluence of the hepatic ducts and are classified as hilar CCAs or Klatskin tumours.

The most common physical indications of CCA include symptoms such as jaundice, dyspepsia, and a palpable abdominal mass. Symptoms of CCA depend on whether the tumour mass is located in the intrahepatic area, hilar area, or extrahepatic area. Surgical intervention plays a major role in the treatment of early stage CCA and yields promising results. Patients with unresectable tumours can be treated with palliative procedures such as biliary-enteric bypass or endoscopic or percutaneous stent placement. Palliative surgical bypass is associated with a slightly improved survival rate compared to percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage. Palliative chemotherapy does not show significant benefits, as survival rates remain low.

Common metastatic sites of CCA include the regional lymph nodes and adjacent organs. Distant metastases from CCA are uncommon, but when they do occur, they usually develop in the bone, muscle, brain, and thyroid gland. To our knowledge, no other cases of penile metastasis from CCA have been described in the literature. Here, we report the case of a patient who presented with penile metastatic CCA and who was treated in our institution. We aim to provide useful information on this extremely rare condition.

NCCN Bone cancer — biopsy principles emphasize that prior to biopsy, consultation should be obtained with an orthopedic oncologist regarding appropriate prebiopsy imaging, and preoperative biopsy consultation with a pediatric oncologist as appropriate is recommended for children. Biopsy diagnosis is necessary prior to any surgical procedure or fixation of primary site, and biopsy is optimally performed at a center that will do definitive management. Biopsy should be core needle or surgical biopsy. Technique: Apply same principles for core needle or open biopsy. Needle biopsy is not recommended for skull base tumors. Appropriate communication between the surgeon, musculoskeletal or interventional radiologist, and bone pathologist is critical, and fresh tissue may be needed for biomarker testing and tissue banking. In general, not following appropriate biopsy procedures may lead to adverse patient outcomes.

### Liver biopsy [^112Dia7J]. Hepatology (2009). Medium credibility.

Mass lesions — most experts consider biopsy of most liver mass lesions to be a safe and effective means to provide important clinical information, and most experts prefer that the core sample rather than aspirates be obtained if a diagnosis of neoplasia is being entertained; in general, fine-needle aspiration provides cytology, which typically has less diagnostic value than an adequate core biopsy. Caveats include that biopsy of known vascular lesions should generally be avoided, US with color Doppler can help identify and avoid larger vessels, and biopsy of malignant lesions is associated with a risk of tumor spread usually along the biopsy tract, although this risk is almost certainly overstated in earlier literature.

Biopsy strategy and staging impact — unresectable Wilms tumor: If a unilateral renal tumor is not resectable (unless a predisposing condition is present), a tumor biopsy is necessary, and unresectability may be due to extension to contiguous structures, solitary kidney, thrombus extending above the hepatic veins, bilateral tumors, involvement of surrounding organs, or pulmonary function compromise; metastases are not typically a contraindication to surgery. When biopsy is indicated, an open posterior biopsy or a percutaneous core needle biopsy are the two options that should be considered, fine-needle aspiration (FNA) is not recommended, and if surgical exploration intended for resection finds the tumor unresectable an open biopsy should be performed. Biopsy will automatically upstage the local stage to stage III, which will require additional chemotherapy and radiation therapy (RT); unless a rim of capsule or normal tissue is included a core or needle biopsy cannot distinguish nephrogenic rests from WT, and anaplastic histology is often not identified on core needle or open wedge biopsy but is identified on nephrectomy specimens.

### Study details | Robotically assisted surgery for perihilar… [^113HYLng]. ClinicalTrials (2024). Medium credibility.

Perihilar cholangiocarcinoma, also called Klatskin tumour, involves the biliary confluence with or without involvement of the right and left hepatic ducts. It is a challenging disease to manage in the preoperatory setting and during surgery. Painless jaundice is the main symptom at presentation. It often arises rapidly and it is present in 90% of pCCA. Fatigue, anorexia, weight loss and non-specific abdominal pain are other common symptoms. Complete resection with negative histologic margins is the only chance of cure and the most robust predictor of long-term survival for patients affected by any type of locally advanced CCA. However, the proximity of perihilar tumors to vital structures, such as the hepatic artery, portal vein, and hepatic parenchyma, makes curative excision technically difficult. Radical surgical resection of pCCA usually requires a hemi-hepatectomy, often extended.

For this reason, the preoperative assessment of the future liver remnant volume is a critical step in the surgical plan. Traditionally, a "safe" liver resection requires a FLR of at least 25% in a perfectly healthy liver. Liver and bile duct resection for pCCA are technically complex procedures: the specimen resection with negative margins requires careful dissection of major vascular structures such as portal vein and hepatic arteries. Once completed the resection the biliary tract must be reconstructed, usually with a Jejunal loop. This step of the procedure is particularly complex and requires high levels of skills and detail, thus, so far, has widely limited the use of laparoscopic surgery to complete the surgical procedure. STUDY POPULATION AND METHODS This is a prospective observational study. All patients affected by pCCA that will undergo curative intent surgery that requires biliary reconstruction will be enrolled in the study after the work up for surgery.

Preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative data will be collected. The DaVinci® robotic platform available at the Padova University hospital will be utilised primarily. INCLUSION CRITERIA Age ≥ 18 years Histologically proven pCCA Highly presumed bile duct malignancy with difficulties to obtain histological evidence with negative Immunoglobulin G4 Preoperative staging work up performed by abdomen enhanced CT scan. The subject understands the nature of this trial and is willing to comply. Ability to provide written informed consent. Patients treated with curative intent in accordance to international guidelines.

Safety Risks

Based on current evidence, the risk of a major complication is low with percutaneous liver biopsies, but may include bleeding, organ perforation, sepsis, needle track seeding, and death. Bleeding has been reported in up to 10% of cases, with major bleeding occurring in < 2%. Moreover, needle track seeding rates of 0–4% have been reported, mostly after percutaneous biopsy of HCC. Risks of liver biopsy vary based on many factors, including number of passes. A recent study showed 3 or more passes compared to 1 pass significantly increased the risk of complications and morbidity from percutaneous liver biopsies (OR: 2.97; P = 0.0005).

Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma — principles of surgery: A preoperative biopsy is not always necessary before proceeding with a definitive, potentially curative resection, and a suspicious mass on imaging in the proper clinical setting should be treated as malignant. Diagnostic laparoscopy to rule out unresectable disseminated disease should be considered. Initial exploration should assess for multifocal hepatic disease, lymph node metastases, and distant metastases, and lymph node metastases beyond the porta hepatis and distant metastatic disease contraindicate resection. Hepatic resection with negative margins is the goal of surgical therapy, and while major resections are often necessary, wedge resections and segmental resections are all appropriate given that a negative margin can be achieved. A regional lymphadenectomy of the porta hepatis is carried out. Multifocal liver disease is generally representative of metastatic disease and is a contraindication to resection; however, in highly selected cases with limited multifocal disease resection can be considered. Gross lymph node metastases to the porta hepatis portend a poor prognosis and resection should only be considered in highly selected cases. Minimally invasive approaches by experienced surgeons have been proven to be safe and effective for well-selected cases. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is not a criterion for upstaging to stage III; if biopsied, a tumor is considered stage III for determining chemotherapy regimen, but biopsy alone does not upstage for whether to give RT. At week 6 of EE4A (or VAD), the tumor is reimaged with repeat imaging of the lungs before general anesthesia, and further treatment is dictated depending on the response.

NCCN Gastrointestinal stromal tumors — principles of biopsy and diagnosis state that an endoscopic transmural biopsy would be favored over a percutaneous transperitoneal biopsy, as the risk for peritoneal seeding is lower for this technique, and percutaneous image-guided biopsy may be appropriate for the confirmation of locally advanced or metastatic disease. Consideration of biopsy should be based on the suspected tumor type and extent of disease, and biopsy is necessary to confirm the diagnosis of primary GIST prior to the initiation of preoperative therapy. Morphologic diagnosis based on microscopic examination of histologic sections is the standard for GIST diagnosis; several ancillary techniques are recommended in support of GIST diagnosis, including immunohistochemistry (IHC) for SDHB, CD117, and DOG1, and molecular genetic testing for KIT and PDGFRA mutations, as well as other potential drivers (eg, BRAF, NF1, NTRK, and FGFR fusions). Diagnosis is based on the Principles of Pathologic Assessment (NCCN Guidelines for Soft Tissue Sarcoma); referral to centers with expertise and experience in the diagnosis and management of GIST/sarcoma is recommended for those patients with complex or unusual histopathologic features. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### Wilms tumor, version 2.2025, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^112emzTE]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Wilms tumor (nephroblastoma) biopsy principles state that routine pre-nephrectomy biopsy for resectable renal tumors is contraindicated due to the risk of recurrence from tumor spill. Tumor biopsy will automatically upstage the local stage to III, which in turn mandates additional cardiotoxic chemotherapy (doxorubicin) and RT (for treatment of those with unilateral tumor without a predisposing condition). The only situation in which a pre-treatment biopsy is recommended is when the tumor is deemed unresectable in patients with a unilateral tumor without a predisposing condition. If a biopsy is thus considered, there are two possible options: an open posterior approach — done to avoid intra-abdominal spill — or percutaneous core needle biopsies; fine-needle aspirates are not recommended. In both instances, sufficient tissue must be obtained so that all necessary tests may be performed, and identification of anaplasia may be difficult by either biopsy technique. If surgical exploration is performed with intent to resect but the tumor is deemed unresectable, then open biopsy should be performed. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.
