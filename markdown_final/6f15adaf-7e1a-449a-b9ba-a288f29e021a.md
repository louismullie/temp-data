## Question

What does a pulsitile abdominal mass seem like

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what a pulsatile abdominal mass is, what it might indicate, and how to interpret its clinical significance. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core definition and what makes a mass "pulsatile". Then, I should verify the most common cause and its classic clinical context. Next, I will review key mimics and how to distinguish them at the bedside. After that, I need to check the diagnostic approach, including when to use ultrasound versus CT and what to do in unstable patients. Finally, I should confirm red flags, risk stratification, and immediate actions that change outcomes, anchoring to guideline-based recommendations.

> Let me first confirm the core concept: a pulsatile abdominal mass is a palpable lump in the abdomen that moves synchronously with the cardiac cycle, reflecting transmission of arterial pulsation from a large vessel, most often the abdominal aorta, and it is a high-risk clinical sign that warrants urgent evaluation rather than reassurance [^116qyz9U] [^114nsvCC].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — most pulsatile abdominal masses are due to an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), defined as dilation of the infrarenal abdominal aorta to 3.0 cm or greater. The pulsation is typically midline and epigastric, often expansile rather than merely transmitted, and may be accompanied by a bruit or tenderness if symptomatic or complicated [^116qyz9U] [^114nsvCC].

> Wait, let me verify the clinical context that should trigger immediate concern: the triad of severe abdominal or back pain, hypotension, and a pulsatile mass suggests ruptured AAA, a surgical emergency with very high mortality. However, I should double-check that this triad is present in only about half of cases, so its absence does not exclude rupture and should not delay imaging or transfer when suspicion is high [^114nsvCC] [^113rmKkK].

> I need to ensure I consider mimics that can feel pulsatile but are not aortic: a massively enlarged, pulsatile liver from tricuspid regurgitation or right heart failure can simulate an AAA. A maladjusted pacemaker/CRT stimulating the diaphragm can create a rhythmic abdominal pulsation. And transmitted pulsation from a normal, tortuous aorta or iliac arteries in thin patients can be misleading — so I should confirm expansile quality and midline location before labeling it an AAA [^116SZPWh] [^117PPQZw] [^112vrFSD].

> Next, I should review bedside diagnostic performance and limitations: palpation has moderate sensitivity and poor specificity for AAA, improving with larger diameters. By contrast, emergency department bedside ultrasound for AAA has excellent pooled sensitivity and specificity around 99% and 98%, respectively, making it the first-line test when AAA is suspected and the patient is stable [^116Hrtmo] [^115tyh1m] [^116qyz9U].

> Let me think about the imaging algorithm and where CT fits: if the patient is stable, ultrasound confirms the presence and size of AAA. If the patient is symptomatic (pain, tenderness, new symptoms) or if rupture is suspected, contrast-enhanced CT angiography is indicated to define anatomy, detect rupture, and plan intervention. If the patient is unstable with hypotension and a pulsatile mass, I should not delay operative management for imaging — proceed to the OR while initiating resuscitation, with bedside ultrasound considered only if it will not delay definitive care [^112NcosF] [^111HohP9].

> I should confirm red flags that mandate immediate vascular surgery consultation: any pulsatile abdominal mass with acute abdominal or back pain, syncope or shock, a new bruit over the mass, or rapid enlargement of a known AAA. Conversely, a stable, asymptomatic pulsatile mass in a low-risk patient still warrants urgent imaging but is not an immediate surgical emergency [^116Dhhw7] [^114nsvCC].

> But wait, what if the mass is not midline or not expansile — could it be an abdominal wall mass or a retroperitoneal tumor? I need to check location, reducibility, and relationship to the peritoneum; ultrasound can distinguish abdominal wall masses and hernias from intra-abdominal vascular masses, and if a solid mass is suspected, contrast-enhanced CT or MRI helps characterize neoplasms and guide management [^115Fve7L] [^115fi1qS].

> Let me reconsider risk stratification and follow-up once AAA is confirmed: size-based rupture risk rises substantially as diameter increases, with contemporary estimates around 6.3% per year for aneurysms larger than 7 cm. Surveillance intervals are size-dependent, with ultrasound every 3 years for 3.0–3.9 cm, annually for 4.0–4.9 cm, and every 6 months for 5.0–5.4 cm, with elective repair generally considered at 5.5 cm or greater in suitable candidates [^114AZ6Gu] [^1177DBAR] [^114nsvCC].

> I should double-check that I am using consistent measurement technique: aortic diameter should be measured outer wall to outer wall on transverse views, and because interobserver variability can approach 5 mm, I need to ensure measurements are obtained at the same anatomic level and compared with prior studies to accurately assess interval change [^112ftAwP] [^115PXm8v].

> In summary, a pulsatile abdominal mass most often feels like a midline, expansile, synchronous pulsation suggesting AAA, but I must not anchor prematurely. I need to check for the rupture triad, distinguish mimics at the bedside, and escalate to emergent imaging or operative care when indicated, since timely recognition and pathway-driven management are what change outcomes [^116qyz9U] [^112NcosF] [^113rmKkK].

A pulsatile abdominal mass is a **midline, expansile pulsation** [^116qyz9U] — typically 3–5 cm or larger — that rises with each heartbeat and is most often due to an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) [^114nsvCC]. It is usually **nontender and located just above the umbilicus** [^111HohP9], with a smooth, firm surface and a palpable thrill or bruit in larger aneurysms. Urgent evaluation is required because of rupture risk [^112NcosF]; **ultrasound is first-line** [^111EzSZk] for screening and size assessment, while CT angiography is used for detailed anatomic definition and surgical planning [^111EzSZk] [^112NcosF]. Key mimics include transmitted pulsation from a normal aorta, iliac aneurysms, and retroperitoneal masses; tenderness or pain suggests complications and mandates immediate imaging and vascular consultation [^111HohP9].

---

## Clinical appearance and characteristics

- **Location**: Typically midline, just above the umbilicus, corresponding to the infrarenal abdominal aorta [^116qyz9U].
- **Size**: Generally 3–5 cm or larger; may exceed 10 cm in giant aneurysms.
- **Pulsation**: Expansile, synchronous with the heartbeat, and often visible.
- **Surface**: Smooth, firm, and non-tender unless complicated by rupture or inflammation.
- **Associated signs**: Palpable thrill or audible bruit in larger aneurysms due to turbulent flow [^1177DBAR].

---

## Differential diagnosis

While AAA is the most common cause, other conditions can mimic a pulsatile abdominal mass:

| **Condition** | **Clinical features** | **Distinguishing characteristics** |
|-|-|-|
| Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) | Midline, expansile pulsation above umbilicus | Confirmed by ultrasound/CT [^114nsvCC] |
| Transmitted pulsation from normal aorta | Midline pulsation, non-expansile | Normal aortic diameter on imaging [^112zviMi] |
| Iliac artery aneurysm | Lateral pulsation, lower abdomen | Confirmed by ultrasound/CT [^112Kfk2k] |
| Retroperitoneal mass (e.g. tumor, cyst) | Non-pulsatile or minimally pulsatile | Confirmed by CT/MRI [^115Fve7L] |
| Pseudoaneurysm | Localized pulsatile mass, often post-surgical | Confirmed by ultrasound/CT [^112LmRR4] |

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Prompt imaging is essential to confirm the diagnosis, assess size, and guide management:

- **Ultrasound**: First-line screening tool; high sensitivity and specificity for AAA detection [^111EzSZk] [^116Hrtmo].
- **Computed tomography angiography (CTA)**: Gold standard for detailed anatomic assessment, sizing, and surgical planning [^111EzSZk] [^112NcosF].
- **Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA)**: Alternative when iodinated contrast is contraindicated [^111EzSZk].

---

## Clinical significance and risks

A pulsatile abdominal mass signifies a **potentially life-threatening condition**, chiefly AAA, with a rupture risk that rises with size [^114AZ6Gu] and growth rate. Rupture carries high mortality, underscoring the need for urgent evaluation and management [^1163UkYg].

---

## Management considerations

Management depends on aneurysm size, growth rate, and patient comorbidities:

- **Small aneurysms (< 4.0 cm)**: Regular ultrasound surveillance every 6–12 months [^notfound].
- **Medium aneurysms (4.0–5.4 cm)**: Surveillance every 3–6 months; consider surgical intervention if rapid growth or symptoms develop [^116Dhhw7].
- **Large aneurysms (≥ 5.5 cm)**: Surgical repair (open or endovascular) is generally recommended [^114nsvCC].

---

A pulsatile abdominal mass is a **midline, expansile pulsation** most often due to AAA; it is nontender, smooth, and may have a thrill or bruit. Immediate imaging and vascular consultation are critical because of rupture risk; ultrasound is first-line and CTA defines anatomy for intervention [^116qyz9U].

Discussion

DF is a rare but important consideration in the evaluation of a new mass. Patients with FAP are at increased risk of DF, with DF occurring in 10%–30% of patients with FAP and 10%–20% of patients with DF having FAP. This association is related to the implication of the dysregulation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in DF. The APC gene defective in FAP is a regulator of β-catenin.

DF has also been shown to have a proclivity for development in locations with prior surgical scar. Specifically for abdominal wall DF, most affected patients are female with childbearing history, as was our patient in this case.

With regard to imaging choices during consideration of DF, different modalities may be considered but are suboptimal compared with MRI. On ultrasound, DF presents as variably defined infiltrative heterogeneous mass, with variable echogenicity. On CT, DF is often isodense to skeletal muscle with areas of variable attenuation attributed to areas of high collagen content or myxoid components.MRI is frequently useful and is considered the gold standard for imaging. Biopsy is needed for diagnosis. MRI is considered the gold standard for staging and surveillance of DF as it provides detailed information on relationship of the mass to adjacent structures.

Treatment of DF was historically surgery, but local recurrence rate is around 28%. More contemporary approaches to treating DF include watchful waiting, radiation therapy, cryoablation and systemic agents such as chemotherapy or tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Regarding our patient, her DF was symptomatic and had shown interval enlargement, so surgery was the best approach.

This particular patient had recently undergone extensive spinal surgery with a posterior approach, which is associated with retroperitoneal or epidural haematoma. Abdominal wall haematoma resulting from spinal surgery appears to be rare, as we were not able to identify any such association in the literature.

This case demonstrates the importance of keeping a wide differential for abdominal wall mass postoperatively, especially in the case of interval enlargement or non-timely resolution of the mass as well as persistent discomfort. A clinician must consider neoplastic disease in the differential diagnosis in cases where a haematoma seems atypical in nature.

Learning points

Clinicians should keep a broad differential diagnosis and a soft tissue neoplasm should be considered when clinical symptoms do not resemble radiological findings.
Desmoid fibromatosis is a rare locally invasive neoplasm, and some studies suggest observation rather than surgical excision based on an otherwise asymptomatic clinical presentation.
Imaging with additional modalities such as ultrasound or MRI may be warranted for further differentiation if initial imaging is inconsistent with clinical findings.

Female patients who have stable vital signs presenting to the emergency department with abdominopelvic pain and an adnexal mass can be extremely difficult to manage. However, by performing a rapid problem-oriented history and physical with emphasis on the age of patient, menstrual history, and pelvic exam, a detailed differential diagnosis can be compiled. With the addition of a complete blood count and HCG, if appropriate, and a CA-125 for your consultant, additional information can be obtained while a ultrasound examination is being performed. With the above information, consultation and disposition should be readily accomplished.

### Vascular abdominal emergencies [^1149gPFM]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Patients with nonspecific abdominal pain can have any one of many disease processes. The physical examination may not reveal clear abnormalities, making the diagnosis more difficult. Vascular abdominal emergencies are not common but, when present, may be catastrophic, with significant morbidity and, frequently, mortality. Most of the conditions are time sensitive, leaving the integrity of organ blood flow at risk. Thromboembolic disease leads to ischemia and eventual infarction of the intra-abdominal organs. Aneurismal dilation of the aorta with rupture leads to rapid hypovolemic shock and death if not diagnosed. A high index of suspicion is critical to the successful diagnosis.

### The Society for Vascular Surgery practice guidelines on the care of patients with an abdominal aortic aneurysm [^112NcosF]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) symptomatic imaging — In patients with abdominal or back pain, ultrasound imaging is recommended to determine whether an AAA is present and to evaluate for other causes; if an aneurysm is detected, the patient should have CT arteriography with timed intravenous injection of contrast material, if it is not contraindicated, to exclude rupture and to facilitate operative planning. A patient presenting with a large AAA and back or abdominal pain should be referred for treatment as soon as an aneurysm is recognized, and if hemodynamic compromise is present or evolves during evaluation, further imaging studies should be abandoned as care is escalated. We recommend a CT scan to evaluate patients thought to have AAA presenting with recent-onset abdominal or back pain, particularly in the presence of a pulsatile epigastric mass or significant risk factors for AAA, with Level of recommendation 1 (Strong) and Quality of evidence B (Moderate).

### ACR appropriateness criteria® pulsatile abdominal mass, suspected abdominal aortic aneurysm: 2023 update [^116qyz9U]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is defined as abnormal dilation of the infrarenal abdominal aortic diameter to 3.0 cm or greater. The natural history of AAA consists of progressive expansion and potential rupture. Although most AAAs are clinically silent, a pulsatile abdominal mass identified on physical examination may indicate the presence of an AAA. When an AAA is suspected, an imaging study is essential to confirm the diagnosis. This document reviews the relative appropriateness of various imaging procedures for the initial evaluation of suspected AAA. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaPulsatile abdominal mass suspected abdominal aortic Aneurysm [^111EzSZk]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Clinical palpation of a pulsating abdominal mass alerts the clinician to the presence of a possible abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Imaging studies are important in diagnosing and categorizing the extent of the aneurysm and may aid in treatment planning. The consensus of the literature supports the use of ultrasound as the initial screening test in patients with suspected AAA. Population-based ultrasound screening studies have been recommended and have proved effective for male patients > 65 years of age. For diagnosis and pre-intervention evaluation, either multidetector CT or CT angiography is the optimal choice for detailed characterization of the aneurysm. MR angiography may be substituted if CT cannot be performed (for example, because the patient is allergic to iodinated contrast material). Invasive angiography has little role in the diagnosis of AAA and PET and CT remain experimental in patients with suspected aneurysms. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### An unstable patient with a pulsatile mass: proceed immediately to the OR? [^116SZPWh]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

This is a case report of a patient who presented to the Emergency Department with abdominal pain, unstable vital signs, and a pulsatile abdominal mass. Current recommendations are to limit diagnostics and send the patient to the operating room as soon as possible for laparotomy because even if an abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture is not found, most of these patients will end up having pathology for which surgery will ultimately be needed. This case report describes a patient who did not have a surgical cause for her presentation, but rather, severe tricuspid regurgitation and, consequently, significant pulsatile hepatomegaly accounting for the finding of a pulsatile abdominal mass. A brief overview of how such patients should be managed is presented as well as a recommendation that urgent bedside sonography be undertaken before proceeding to the operating room.

Study Design

Resident's case problem.

Background

The purpose of this report was to describe (1) the clinical reasoning that led a clinician to identify an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in a patient with low back pain requiring immediate medical referral, and (2) an evidence-based approach to clinical evaluation of patients with suspected AAA.

Diagnosis

The patient was unable to identify a specific mechanism of injury for his low back pain, lacked aggravating/easing factors for his symptoms, and complained of night pain and an inability to ease his symptoms with position changes. While the patient's symptoms remained unchanged during physical examination of the lumbar spine and hip, abdominal palpation revealed a strong, nontender pulsation over the midline of the upper and lower abdominal quadrants. Due to concern for an AAA, the patient was immediately referred to his physician. Subsequent computed tomography imaging revealed a prominent AAA, which measured up to 5.5 cm in greatest dimension and extended from below the renal arteries to the bifurcation of the iliac arteries. The patient initially deferred surgical intervention but eventually consented 6 months later, after repeat computed tomography imaging revealed that the AAA had progressed to 6.7 cm in greatest dimension.

Discussion

It is essential for physical therapists to be familiar with a diagnostic pathway to help identify AAA in patients presenting with apparent musculoskeletal complaints. Knowledge of the risk factors for AAA, understanding how to screen for nonmusculoskeletal symptoms, and a basic competence in abdominal palpation and how to interpret findings will help with the clinician's clinical decision making.

### A tender pulsatile epigastric mass is NOT always an abdominal aortic aneurysm: a case report and review of literature [^112vrFSD]. Journal of Radiology Case Reports (2010). Low credibility.

Of greatest concern in the assessment of a patient with a tender pulsatile abdominal mass is the possibility of a leaking or ruptured Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA). Other serious abdominal pathologies may demonstrate the same clinical signs but require entirely different treatments. Even amongst patients with proven abdominal aortic aneurysms CT imaging findings may influence the timing and nature of surgery and provide useful prognostic information. We present a case in which a large abdominal tender pulsatile mass was not aortic in origin. The patient had a significantly large tender congested liver associated with right side heart failure due to progressive tricuspid valve regurgitation. We have also discussed the differential diagnoses which may mimic abdominal aneurysms and discussed the role of imaging in resolving these problems.

### Primary and secondary tumors of the peritoneum: key imaging features and differential diagnosis with surgical and pathological correlation [^1123Em9y]. Insights Into Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Peritoneal malignancies represent a heterogeneous group of neoplasms with different characteristics in terms of incidence, diagnosis, treatment options and prognosis.

Their clinical presentation is insidious and often delays the diagnosis, as many patients are asymptomatic in its early stages or complain of non-specific symptoms such as abdominal distension and discomfort due to ascites. As the disease progresses, symptoms become more evident, causing more intense abdominal pain with nausea, vomiting and eventually bowel obstruction.

Although traditionally considered fatal diseases, the development of new therapeutic strategies in recent years, such as the combination of cytoreductive primary surgery (CRS) with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC), has changed this scenario, leading to an overall improvement in patient survival.

The main purpose of this work is to carry out a comprehensive review of the broad spectrum of peritoneal tumors, emphasizing those key imaging features useful for differential diagnosis and correlating them with the surgical and pathological findings.

Cancer is diagnosed in 1 in 7000 children annually. Here, we report 6 cases of a mass identified by the author, a novice sonographer in a pediatric emergency medicine fellowship, using point-of-care ultrasound, from January of 2017 to May of 2018. Identification of these cases early in presentation allowed for earlier involvement of the relevant specialist and shorter time to diagnosis and treatment, and might be expected to increase parent satisfaction as well.

### Saccular and fusiform abdominal aortic aneurysms treated with endovascular repair differ in presentation and treatment threshold: analyses using a national clinical database in Japan [^1127oaKc]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Most AAAs are fusiform AAAs and often occur as a result of degeneration of the aortic wall. On the other hand, saccular AAAs are rare and seem to be mainly caused by degeneration, followed by a variety of causes, such as dissection, trauma, infection, and vasculitis. Although aneurysm diameter and growth rate have been widely accepted as major indications for repair of an AAA, a saccular morphology has also been considered as an indication for repair. Despite the common perception that saccular aneurysms are at high risk of rupture, not much has been known about the natural history and the risk of rupture in saccular AAAs. Furthermore, there are limited data on what diameter saccular AAAs are treated with surgery in clinical practice.

According to a previous large cohort study of saccular AAAs conducted in the Netherlands, saccular AAAs were operated on at smaller diameters than fusiform AAAs in the elective setting (mean, 53.0 versus 61.0 mm; P < 0.001) and became symptomatic or ruptured at smaller diameters than fusiform AAAs (mean, 70.7 versus 76.5 mm; P = 0.033). The authors also added that a diameter of 45 mm seems to be an acceptable threshold for surgery, based on the finding that the proportion of symptomatic/ruptured patients was similar between saccular AAAs with diameters < 45 mm and fusiform AAAs with diameters < 55 mm. However, the number of symptomatic/ruptured cases of saccular AAAs (n = 83), especially those with a diameter < 45 mm (n = 7), was insufficient for a powerful statistical analysis. The present study focused on the rupture of AAAs, because patients could be described as symptomatic if the aneurysm caused a pulsing sensation or local compression symptoms, and such symptomatic patients should be differentiated from patients presenting with abdominal or back pain. Furthermore, the primary goal of the physician taking care of patients with AAA is to predict the risk of rupture, not the development of symptoms.

### The AIUM practice parameter for the performance of an ultrasound examination of the abdomen and / or retroperitoneum [^115fi1qS]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Abdominal wall — When there are signs or symptoms referable to the abdominal wall, an ultrasound examination may be performed to evaluate for hernia, masses, fluid collections, or other abnormalities, and the examination should include images of the abdominal wall in the location of symptoms or signs and often necessitates scanning with a high-frequency, high-resolution transducer. The relationship of any identified mass to the peritoneum should be demonstrated, any defect in the peritoneum and abdominal wall musculature should be documented, and the presence or absence of bowel, fluid, organs, or other tissues contained within any abdominal wall defect should be noted. Valsalva maneuvers in supine and upright positioning may be helpful in hernia detection and determining reducibility, the inferior epigastric vessels are an important anatomic landmark in hernia characterization, and Doppler examination may be useful to evaluate for vascular flow in an abdominal mass; cine clip images can be useful to further define abdominal wall hernias.

### Abdominal aortic aneurysm [^114nsvCC]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm refers to abdominal aortic dilation of 3.0 cm or greater. The main risk factors are age older than 65 years, male sex, and smoking history. Other risk factors include a family history of abdominal aortic aneurysm, coronary artery disease, hypertension, peripheral artery disease, and previous myocardial infarction. Diagnosis may be made by physical examination, an incidental finding on imaging, or ultrasonography. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force released updated recommendations for abdominal aortic aneurysm screening in 2014. Men 65 to 75 years of age with a history of smoking should undergo one-time screening with ultrasonography based on evidence that screening will improve abdominal aortic aneurysm-related mortality in this population. Men in this age group without a history of smoking may benefit if they have other risk factors (e.g., family history of abdominal aortic aneurysm, other vascular aneurysms, coronary artery disease). There is inconclusive evidence to recommend screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm in women 65 to 75 years of age with a smoking history. Women without a smoking history should not undergo screening because the harms likely outweigh the benefits. Persons who have a stable abdominal aortic aneurysm should undergo regular surveillance or operative intervention depending on aneurysm size. Surgical intervention by open or endovascular repair is the primary option and is typically reserved for aneurysms 5.5 cm in diameter or greater. There are limited options for medical treatment beyond risk factor modification. Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm is a medical emergency presenting with hypotension, shooting abdominal or back pain, and a pulsatile abdominal mass. It is associated with high prehospitalization mortality. Emergent surgical intervention is indicated for a rupture but has a high operative mortality rate.

### Misdiagnosis of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm: systematic review and meta-analysis [^1144Cimj]. Journal of Endovascular Therapy (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

To quantitatively summarize the incidence of misdiagnosis of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms (rAAA), the most common presenting features, and the commonest incorrect differential diagnoses.

Methods

A systematic search according to PRISMA guidelines was performed using EMBASE and MEDLINE databases to identify studies reporting the initial rate of misdiagnosis of patients with rAAA. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed to estimate the rate of misdiagnosis, presenting features, and commonest differential diagnoses. A sensitivity analysis was performed for studies reporting after 1990.

Results

Nine studies comprising 1109 patients contributed to the pooled analysis, which found a 42% incidence of rAAA misdiagnosis (95% CI 29% to 55%). In studies reporting after 1990, misdiagnosis was seen in 32% (95% CI 16% to 49%). The most common erroneous differential diagnoses were ureteric colic and myocardial infarction. Abdominal pain, shock, and a pulsatile mass were presenting features in 61% (49%-72%), 46% (32%-61%), and 45% (29%-62%) of rAAAs, respectively.

Conclusion

The rate of misdiagnosis of rAAA has remained consistent over time and is concerning. There is a need for an effective clinical decision tool to enable accurate diagnosis and triage at the scene of the emergency.

### Imaging findings and clinical features of abdominal vascular compression syndromes [^113VWqHh]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

This article describes the typical imaging findings and clinical features that are associated with four abdominal vascular compression syndromes. We explain the underlying pathophysiology that results in these clinical syndromes so that the patient subset who will benefit from treatment can be identified.

Conclusion

The abdominal vascular compression syndromes discussed here are uncommon and are potentially easily missed on a cursory review of radiologic examinations, particularly in a nonspecific and vague clinical setting. Hence, knowledge of the typical imaging findings and associated clinical symptoms is essential so that the they can be carefully sought and excluded. However, because these findings may also exist in healthy individuals as anatomic variants, it is important to correlate radiologic findings with clinical symptoms to identify the subset of patients who will benefit from treatment.

### Pediatric abdominal masses: imaging guidelines and recommendations [^115hnLde]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Pediatric abdominal masses are commonly encountered in the pediatric population, with a broad differential diagnosis that encompasses benign and malignant entities. The primary role of abdominal imaging in the setting of a suspected pediatric abdominal mass is to establish its presence, as nonneoplastic entities can mimic an abdominal mass, and to identify characteristic imaging features that narrow the differential diagnosis. In the setting of a neoplasm, various imaging modalities play an important role to characterize the mass, stage extent of disease, and assist in presurgical planning. The purpose of this article is to discuss a practical imaging algorithm for suspected pediatric abdominal masses and to describe typical radiological findings of the commonly encountered abdominal masses in neonates and children with emphasis on imaging guidelines and recommendations.

### Basic ultrasound head-to-toe skills for intensivists in the general and neuro intensive care unit population: consensus and expert recommendations of the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine [^116ntGUb]. Intensive Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Item 1. Triage or clinical suspicion for aortic syndromes (ESM 5, Figure S1)

We recommend that the scanning from the epigastrium up to the mesogastrium at the level of umbilicus, in a transverse and longitudinal plane for the detection of aneurysms of the abdominal aorta (AAA) in case of unexplained shock, abdominal pain, pulsatile mass palpation, presence of emboli, should be considered as basic skill (strong recommendation).

Background

Bedside abdominal US when used as a screening modality, has been shown to be associated with excellent accuracy (sensitivity of 95–100% and specificity of nearly 100%) for the detection of AAA. Moreover, clinical studies demonstrated that abdominal US screening reduced aortic syndrome related mortality, primarily through a reduction in rupture by emergency repair. US for the diagnosis of aortic aneurism was considered a basic skill by the panel. However, the ultrasound diagnosis of rupture is complex and needs to be integrated with clinical findings (Fig. 4, ESM 2, Figure S4).

Item 2. Assessment of kidneys and urinary tract (ESM 5, Figure S2–S7)

We recommend that B-mode evaluation of both kidneys and bladder in the short- and long-axis views to assess for the presence or absence of hydronephrosis and bladder overdistention should be considered as basic skill (strong recommendation).
We recommend that the qualitative assessment of urine volume in the bladder, to identify bladder overdistension or prevent unnecessary catheterization should be considered as basic skill (strong recommendation).
We are unable to provide any recommendation regarding the assessment of renal doppler resistive index (RDRI) of the interlobar arteries to predict adverse outcomes and renal failure progression (no recommendation).

Background

B-mode US has a key role in the diagnosis of hydronephrosis and kidney injury due to its high sensitivity (> 95%) (Fig. 4); RDRI has been shown to be a promising tool to predict acute kidney injury progression in post-operative setting as well as predict ICU mortality with a diagnostic accuracy higher than oliguria and serum creatinine levels. However, it has not been extensively validated in relatively inexperienced operators and requires more studies to determine whether it can be recommended as a basic US application in clinical practice.

### Malignant peritoneal mesothelioma: clinical aspects, and therapeutic perspectives [^116mSVrj]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical presentation

MPM is usually diagnosed at an advanced stage, probably because disease manifestations are non-specific in the early stage. Clinical presentation is quite variable, depending on the extent of tumor spread within the abdominal cavity. Accumulation of ascites and growth of tumor masses result in abdominal distension in 30–80% of patients. Abdominal pain is the second most common presenting symptom in approximately 27–58% of cases. The typical growth pattern of MPM is diffuse, rather than infiltrative. Swelling of lymph nodes due to local involvement may lead to the obstruction of the superior vena cava, while an acute abdomen can be caused by malignant bowel obstruction or perforation. Patients may also suffer from unspecific symptoms, such as early satiety, anorexia, weight loss, vomiting, constipation, and/or diarrhea. Less common complaints include new-onset hernia, fever of unknown origin and night sweats. Nevertheless, approximately 8% of patients are diagnosed incidentally.

### MR imaging of ovarian masses: classification and differential diagnosis [^111862Eq]. Insights Into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Diagnostic imaging

Diagnostic imaging plays a crucial role in detection, characterization and staging of adnexal masses.

Ultrasound (US) is often the first imaging study performed in the evaluation of a suspected ovarian lesion because it's widely available, well accepted by patients, non-invasive and of low cost. A combination of greyscale and colour Doppler features, obtained with transabdominal and/or endovaginal scanning, allow for investigation of both morphological structure and vascular organization of the ovarian mass. Morphological features suggestive of malignancy include thickness (> 2–3 mm) and irregularity of walls and septa, the presence of solid areas and papillary projections, as well as other evidence of malignant activity, namely ascites, peritoneal nodules and metastatic lesions. Regarding the vascularization, colour Doppler study is able to demonstrate both the presence and the localization of new tumour blood vessel: a predominantly central blood flow is more often associated with malignancy, while a peripheral one is more typical of a benign lesion. In an ultrasound-indeterminate adnexal mass, Doppler ultrasound has shown a sensitivity of 84% and a specificity of 82% in diagnosing cancer. Wu et al. on a recent meta-analysis of ten independent studies, reported a high diagnostic accuracy of contrast-enhanced ultrasound in distinguishing between benign and malignant ovarian masses. However, unless morphological and vascularity features clearly indicate a benign lesion, further assessment is mandatory. Levine et al. in a consensus statement (2009) for the Society of Radiologists in Ultrasound, made recommendations about management of adnexal masses: "Adnexal masses in the physiologic range in terms of size and appearance in a woman of menstrual age or a simple adnexal cyst less than or equal to 1 cm in a postmenopausal woman are likely benign; these findings are almost always of no clinical importance in asymptomatic women and can be safely ignored".

### Study on the clinical value of computed tomography angiography in the diagnosis of aortic aneurysm [^112Sg5sP]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

TAA and AAA are potentially fatal cardiovascular diseases caused by genetic predisposition and multiple factors. Under excessive pressure, the aortic tube wall thickens as the pressure increases, and eventually leads to an aortic aneurysm. Aortic aneurysms are highly risky in adults over the age of 60, and frequently result in death. In clinical practice, the cause of aortic aneurysms is currently thought to be the most closely associated with atherosclerosis. Blood lipid levels in the elderly increase, leading to the degeneration of elastic fibers and rupture and calcification of the aortic wall, while an aortic aneurysm is caused by the formation of atherosclerotic plaques in the arterial wall. Aortic aneurysm, which is common in the middle-aged and elderly, has become a serious threat to human health; with a rapid onset, it may result in 80% of deaths within 6 weeks if not detected and treated early. Patients in the early stage have no obvious clinical symptoms, but aortic aneurysms gradually increase as patients get older until the aorta cannot withstand it and ruptures, seriously endangering the life of patients. Thus, early detection, intervention, and treatment can help control the disease and prolong the lives of patients. In addition, point of care ultrasound (POCUS) can rapidly and accurately diagnose and guide the treatment of critical illness, and has been widely used in emergency medicine, critical care and other fields. DSA has been the "golden standard" for the diagnosis of vascular disease, and it is clinically used to clearly and accurately check the size, site, quantity, form, and other features of aortic aneurysms. However, the traumatic nature of the procedure as well as the high risk and cost dissuade many patients, creating a market for the non-invasive and inexpensive CTA. Patients with TAA and AAA generally have no visible clinical symptoms. Those under the age of 50 are more likely to have a pulsatile mass around the umbilicus or in the middle and superior abdomen, with some developing abdominal pulsation when lying on the back and some even developing abdominal distension. Patients with TAA and AAA may feel pain, and persistent pain often indicates sudden, persistent, and sharp dilation and rupture of the aortic aneurysm, mostly on the back and in the lower abdomen. In this case, patients frequently suffer from sudden pain in the back, accompanied by acute abdominal pain and tenderness, and the majority develop a pulsatile mass and hypotension. TAA and AAA are serious complications that endanger health; nevertheless, only one third of patients exhibit clinical manifestations, with the remainder being misdiagnosed with other diseases with similar symptoms, such as appendicitis.

Introduction

Abdominal aortic aneurysm or AAA ("triple A") is one of the top 15 leading causes of death in the United States. In this condition, a weakened aortic wall can lead to progressive aortic diameter enlargement and, in some cases, rupture. Aortic rupture is highly morbid and lethal with a mortality rate of up to ~80%.

Risk factors for AAA (defined here as a maximal aortic diameter > 3.5 cm) include advanced age, male sex, smoking, family history of the condition, and hypertension –. AAA can be treated via open or endovascular repair. The mortality rate of the surgery can be just 2–3%. Surgery is indicated for AAAs > 5.5 cm or expanding at a rate > 1 cm/year. Since most AAAs are asymptomatic, screening and surveillance are essential –.

Ultrasound permits accurate and safe detection of AAAs with sensitivity/specificity of 94–100% –. Furthermore, guidelines (e.g. Society for Vascular Surgery) and programs (e.g. Medicare) are in place for one-time screening in specific populations (e.g. men above 65 yearsor men and women aged 65–75 years who have ever smoked,) and for surveillance (e.g. every 12–36 months for AAAs < 5 cm 3). However, ultrasound requires an expert operator, capital equipment, and costs ~$100 per scan. As a result, ultrasound is used in < 1–20% of those patients eligible for AAA screening, and AAA diagnosis is often made based on incidental findings when imaging for other reasons or at the time of rupture. About 1.3 years of life are lost for every 10 unscreened patients, which is similar to breast cancer screening. Ultrasound may be underutilized for AAA surveillance as well. The guidelines assume fixed AAA expansion rates, but AAAs can grow in spurts or even shrink over time. The guidelines and programs are also based on the argument that competing causes of death are significant at very old ages (e.g. > 80 years). However, this argument may become less tenable as society ages and the quality of healthcare advances.

### Cross-sectional imaging of acute gynaecologic disorders: CT and MRI findings with differential diagnosis-part I: corpus luteum and haemorrhagic ovarian cysts, genital causes of haemoperitoneum and adnexal torsion [^114PZMNY]. Insights Into Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Differential diagnosis

The differential diagnosis of AT includes massive ovarian oedema and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). The former entity is a rare, benign condition thought to result from intermittent or partial torsion of the mesovary compromising the venous and lymphatic drainage but with preserved arterial supply.

The imaging appearance of massive ovarian oedema is similar to that of AT: an enlarged ovary with oedematous stroma and multiple nonovulatory follicles pressed towards the periphery of the cortex (Fig. 20). However, patients' clinical history generally records self-limiting episodes of abdominal pain of different durations. The features of pain vary (acute pain or progressive and profound diffuse pain) depending on the rapidity of the torsion; menstrual irregularities, infertility, abdominal distension, signs of virilisation and precocious puberty are also reported.

Fig. 20
Unilateral massive ovarian oedema in a 23-year-old woman with recurrent self-limiting episodes of acute pelvic pain in the last year. Oblique coronal T2-weighted image (a) shows enlargement (4 cm diameter) of the right ovary (arrowhead) characterised by oedematous hyperintense stroma; follicles (thin arrow) and corpus luteum (arrow) are displaced at the periphery of the cortex. Moderate peritoneal effusion (asterisk) coexists. Oblique coronal T2-weighted image (b) demonstrates the normal-appearing left ovary (black arrowhead)

OHSS is an iatrogenic complication of assisted reproduction techniques, characterised by bilaterally enlarged ovaries with several, peripherally located cysts accompanied by fluid shift from the intravascular to third space from increased capillary permeability that may cause the development of ascites, pleural effusions and oliguria in severe forms. Typical imaging findings at CT and MRI include bilateral symmetric enlargement of ovaries due to the presence of multiple cysts representing enlarged follicles or corpus luteum cysts. Cystic content can be fluid-like or haemorrhagic; in the latter case, cysts demonstrate higher attenuation at CT and high T1 signal intensity at MRI. The characteristic peripheral location of the follicles, separated by thin septa and surrounding a central core of ovarian stroma, has been referred to as 'wheel spoke' appearance. Differently from cystic neoplasms, OHSS lacks abnormal enhancing solid components within the cystic lesions; in addition, follow-up imaging should demonstrate resolution. It should also be remembered that enlarged hyperstimulated ovaries are themselves at risk for torsion. If torsion occurs in hyperstimulated ovaries, the latter may demonstrate asymmetrical augmentation, abnormal enhancement, twisted pedicle and eventually haemorrhage.

### Rupture signs on computed tomography, treatment, and outcome of abdominal aortic aneurysms [^1112J4nE]. Insights Into Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Focal wall discontinuity

Many aneurysms are lined with circumferential wall calcifications. In impending or complete AAA rupture, a focal discontinuity of the intimal calcifications can be seen indicating the rupture site, which is most commonly observed on the posterolateral wall. Found in 8% of ruptured aneurysms, this sign is most useful when prior intact circumferential calcified walls were documented on previous scans (Fig. 2). Alternatively, an impending rupture site can also be seen as a focal bulging of the aneurysm wall, also described as an aortic "bleb". This corresponds histologically to inflammatory changes and a focal thinning of elastic fibres.

Fig. 2
Focal wall discontinuity. a Illustration depicts a focal discontinuity (white arrow) of the calcified intima walls (C), indicating the AAA rupture site. b Axial unenhanced CT image of an asymptomatic 56-year-old man shows a 4.2 cm AAA with intact circumferential calcified walls. c Axial unenhanced CT image of the same patient who presented with severe lumbar pain 4 years later. The AAA now measures 5.7 cm, and a new 1 cm focal gap (white arrow) of the circumferential calcifications can be seen with periaortic fat infiltration near the rupture site (white arrowhead)

Hyperattenuating crescent sign

Although intramural thrombus can be regarded as a protective factor against rupture, in fact, intrinsic metabolic activity within the thrombus weakens the underlying aortic wall. When intraluminal blood dissects into the thrombus and comes into contact with the weakened aortic wall, rupture risk is increased. The dissecting blood can be seen as a high-attenuating crescent underlying the intramural thrombus or lying within the aortic wall. The attenuation of this crescent is greater than the aortic lumen on unenhanced scans, and it remains greater than the psoas muscle on enhanced scans. The sensitivity and specificity of the hyperattenuating crescent sign to detect AAA rupture are 77% and 93%, respectively (Fig. 3).

CT imaging with IV contrast was notable for a large cystic lesion in the abdominal cavity with the differential of CSF pseudocyst versus ovarian mass. She underwent paracentesis of the cyst with interventional radiology and required a revision of her ventriculoperitoneal shunt. CSF pseudocysts are a rare complication of ventriculoperitoneal shunts, however, are an important consideration in patients presenting with abdominal complaints and require specialized intervention and assessment.

### Ruptured renal artery aneurysm: an uncommon cause of acute abdominal pain [^1178Tc2R]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Previously thought to be extremely rare, renal artery aneurysms are now being found more commonly as incidental findings during the evaluation of refractory hypertension. Symptoms related to the aneurysm are uncommon and rupture occurs infrequently, but with devastating consequences. Factors predisposing to rupture include pregnancy, polyarteritis nodosa, and lack of aneurysmal calcification. Angiography is the study of choice for diagnosing the presence of visceral aneurysm and rupture. We report a case of ruptured renal artery aneurysm that presented with sudden onset of abdominal pain but no significant findings on physical examination. The patient's size precluded the detection of a pulsatile abdominal mass or the ability to obtain an abdominal angiogram. Computed tomography scan with contrast revealed the correct diagnosis, and successful treatment was initiated.

### Clinical red flags for… [^113arhxq]. AAFP (2013). Low credibility.

GASTROINTESTINAL SYMPTOMS Any abdominal mass should be treated with a high degree of suspicion. In neonates, abdominal masses are usually of benign genitourinary origin. 21 In children younger than five years, the most common malignant causes are neuroblastoma and nephroblastoma. The differential diagnosis also includes cysts and benign tumors of the kidneys, ovaries, or soft tissues. Abdominal masses, as well as any degree of hepatosplenomegaly, call for further investigation with ultrasonography, especially if they are associated with anorexia, vomiting, fever, pain, or a child who appears ill. 5, 12 Persistent vomiting also requires further investigation, especially if it accompanies headaches or neurologic deficits and occurs mainly in the morning.
15. Recent onset constipation that persists and does not respond to conservative treatment should be evaluated for abdominal masses that may cause bowel obstruction or spinal cord lesions that affect sphincters.

5, 6 In children older than six years with intussusception, abdominal lymphoma must be ruled out. 4 Diarrhea may be a symptom of leukemia or lymphoma, but when it is intractable and watery, it may be caused by a vasoactive intestinal-peptide–secreting neuroblastoma.
4. 19 Finally, any palpable mass of the soft tissues that has recently appeared on the extremities, head, neck, or trunk warrants further investigation with ultrasonography or magnetic resonance imaging.
12. 4 Vaginal bleeding in prepubertal girls may be associated with vaginal rhabdomyosarcoma 6 or with a hormone–secreting germ cell tumor. Every scrotal mass should be investigated, because it may be caused by a soft tissue or germ cell tumor, or even leukemia. 6 Finally, an isolated right-sided varicocele is a red flag for a right kidney or other tumor and priapism of leukemia. CARDIORESPIRATORY SYMPTOMS Rarely, cardiorespiratory symptoms may be associated with malignancy.

Nonproductive cough, dyspnea, or orthopnea with no obvious cause that persists for more than two to three weeks and does not respond to treatment, or that is associated with other disturbing findings may result from a mediastinal mass or a pleural effusion caused by lymphoma or leukemia.

### Fetus in fetu: two case reports and literature review [^112iQ5xj]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Fetus in fetu is a rare congenital anomaly and is defined as a monozygotic twin incorporated into the abdomen of its sibling during development. Fetus in fetu is often overlooked in the differential diagnosis of an abdominal mass. Unlike teratomas, fetus in fetu is a benign disorder.

Case presentation

We describe the clinical characteristics of two patients, a thirty-months old boy who was found to have abdominal distension and a neonate who was diagnosed antenatally with abdominal mass. Computed tomography scan revealed the mass in which the contents favor a fetus in fetu rather than a teratoma. Surgical removal revealed that the anencephalic fetus have limb buds situated relative to a palpable vertebral column, supporting the diagnosis of fetus in fetu. In the present report, presentation, diagnosis, pathology, management, and recent literature are also reviewed.

Conclusion

Fetus in fetu is a rare entity that typically presents in infancy and early childhood. It should be differentiated from a teratoma because of the teratoma's malignant potential. Preoperative diagnosis is based on radiologic findings. The treatment of fetus in fetu is operative to relieve obstruction, prevent further compression and possible complications. Complete excision allows confirmation of the diagnosis and lowers the risk of recurrence.

### Tumor in the veins: an abdominal perspective with an emphasis on CT and MR imaging [^112Xpieq]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

The role of CT and MRI in evaluating the abdominal veins

Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are the most commonly used imaging modalities for evaluating the abdominal veins. Due to its wide availability, CT is the most commonly used modality to evaluate the abdominal veins. Isotropic images reformatted in several planes from the source data allow accurate and thorough evaluation of the abdominal venous system. Proper protocoling is of fundamental importance for appropriate evaluation. Venous phase images allow demonstrating the endoluminal venous thrombus and its continuity with adjacent organs.

The filling defect is the main imaging finding. In secondary venous tumors, the endoluminal tumor thrombus typically demonstrates similar enhancement characteristics with the primary source. The thrombosed vessel typically appears enlarged, and perivenous tissues may also be infiltrated by the tumor thrombus. On the contrary, bland thrombi typically do not extend beyond the confines of the venous wall, which is an important finding for diagnosis. Typically, endoluminal thrombi from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), renal cell carcinomas (RCC), and neuroendocrine tumors avidly enhance in arterial phase whereas the other primary or secondary tumor thrombi are relatively hypoenhancing compared to these tumors. The enhancement pattern in tumor thrombi is typically heterogeneous in all phases.

MRI may also be used for assessment of the abdominal veins. MR angiography imaging with or without IV contrast use may be utilized for this purpose. T2-weighted (T2W) images in different planes are especially helpful for detecting endoluminal tumor thrombus. The presence of enhancement after IV contrast injection is helpful for differentiating tumor thrombus from bland thrombus. On T2W images, thrombus characteristically appear as heterogeneously hypointense whereas scattered hyperintense areas may be seen in precontrast T1-weighted (T1W) images due to blood products. Turbulent and pulsatile flow may mimic thrombus on time of flight images, and special attention should be paid for not to misdiagnose this pitfall as a real thrombus. Adequate timing is also important in interpreting MR images as mixture of nonopacified blood, and contrast agent may also mimic a thrombus.

Diffusion restriction is typical for tumor thrombus; however, bland thrombus may also appear as hyperintense on diffusion-weighted (DW) images. Therefore, postcontrast T1W images are critical for differentiating tumor thrombus from its bland counterpart.

### Herniated liver mimicking right atrial mass [^116zPpBW]. Pediatric Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

In a newborn that underwent surgery due to omphalocele, postoperative echocardiography revealed an accidental finding of a right atrial (RA) mass. Echocardiography prior to surgery was inconspicuous. Applying color Doppler, a pulsatile flow exiting the mass could be depicted and a tubular structure lancing through the mass. Thrombus formation was suspected. However, sonographic tissue texture of this formation equaled liver tissue. Abdominal ultrasound revealed protrusion of hepatic tissue through a diaphragmatic hernia indenting the RA mimicking a thrombus.

### Superior pancreaticoduodenal artery pseudoaneurysm mimicking a cystic neoplasm with worrisome features [^111cRJwD]. VideoGIE (2017). Low credibility.

A 61-year-old woman presented with poor appetite, unintentional weight loss (> 30 pounds in 1 year), and intermittent diarrhea. She had undergone a CT in 2012 at another hospital; the scan showed no significant abnormalities. Further investigation with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a 1.4-cm cystic lesion in the body of the pancreas, with wall thickness and enhancing nodule, suggestive of a cystic neoplasm with worrisome features (Figs. 1 A and B). The patient was then referred for EUS with possible EUS-FNA. EUS showed the pancreatic lesion with the same worrisome features described previously during the MRI (Fig. 1 C). However, examination with Doppler US revealed an intense vascular flow in the lesion. The intensely pulsating mass with connection with a surrounding artery raised concern about a diagnosis of pseudoaneurysm with partial thrombosis mimicking the solid components (Fig. 1 D). A CT angiogram confirmed the pancreatic pseudoaneurysm arising from the superior pancreaticoduodenal artery (Fig. 1 E). The patient was then successfully treated with angiographic embolization (Fig. 1 F). The patient had experienced no pain or bleeding episodes at the 3-month follow-up visit. An interval CT scan of the percutaneous embolization showed complete exclusion of the aneurysm with no evidence of recanalization. The underlying cause of her diarrhea was presumed to be irritable bowel syndrome, with workup results that were unremarkable for infectious, inflammatory, or secretory origins. Our patient described a year-long history of significant personal stressors in her life before her presentation. This is an unusual case of a pancreatic pseudoaneurysm mimicking a cystic neoplasm in a patient with no medical history of pancreatitis (Video 1, available online at). The presentation may range from an incidental finding up to hemodynamic collapse from severe bleeding. EUS is an important tool in this diagnosis. Moreover, examination of a lesion referred for EUS-FNA with Doppler US is always recommended to avoid puncture of vascular structures. Although EUS-guided treatment is not the criterion standard for pseudoaneurysms, some publications have reported successful EUS-guided embolization with thrombin.

### Adnexal masses: diagnosis and management [^114vBCFe]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Pelvic masses occur in up to 20% of women throughout their lifetime. These masses represent a spectrum of gynecologic and nongynecologic conditions. Adnexal masses-found in the fallopian tubes, ovaries, and surrounding areas-are mostly benign. Evaluation includes assessment for symptoms that may suggest malignancy, such as abdominal pain, abdominal bloating, and early satiety. A family history of ovarian, breast, or certain heritable syndromes increases the risk of malignancy. For women of reproductive age, ectopic pregnancies must be considered; a beta human chorionic gonadotropin level should be obtained. Transvaginal ultrasonography is the imaging test of choice for evaluating adnexal masses for size and complexity. Adnexal cysts that are greater than 10 cm, contain solid components, or have high color flow on Doppler ultrasonography are high risk for malignancy. Further imaging, if warranted, should be completed with computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, particularly if there is concern for disease outside the ovary. Multimodal assessment tools that use ultrasonography and biomarkers, such as the risk of malignancy index, are useful in the diagnosis and exclusion of malignant causes. Asymptomatic masses that are determined to be benign may be observed and managed expectantly. In symptomatic or emergent cases, such as ectopic pregnancy or ovarian torsion, a gynecologist should be consulted. In any adnexal mass with high risk for malignancy, a consultation with gynecologic oncology is indicated.

### Large renal leiomyoma: a multidisciplinary approach to diagnosis [^114wy77B]. Journal of Radiology Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

We report the case of a 45-year-old woman who presented with a large palpable abdominal mass. Initial sonographic and computed tomographic studies prompted a differential diagnosis of retroperitoneal or renal sarcoma, leiomyoma, and lipid-poor angiomyolipoma. A final diagnosis of renal leiomyoma was reached based on a consensus among radiology, surgery and pathology. In addition to reviewing the features of this entity, this case demonstrates the process of developing a working diagnosis, narrowing the differential as zadditional testing is performed and establishing a final diagnosis with interdepartmental coordination. Despite the rarity of this condition, the ability to recognize and apply imaging features to differentiate between abdominal masses of unknown origin is important for clinicians and researchers.

Abdominal aorta point-of-care ultrasound — scanning and measurement should visualize the aorta in both the transverse and longitudinal planes and extend from the celiac axis to beyond the aortic bifurcation into common iliac arteries; measurement of the anteroposterior dimension should be obtained by using the long- and short-axis views, width in transverse or coronal views, and measurements taken at the greatest diameter from outer edge to outer edge, while examining the lumen for an intraluminal thrombus or flap. If unexpected or unexplained findings are obtained, a comprehensive examination should be ordered, and an examination for intraluminal irregularity, a mass or narrowing, or an extraluminal mass or collection should also be performed and if found should prompt a comprehensive examination. If an aneurysm is present, the maximal size and location should be documented and recorded, the relationship with the renal arteries and the aortic bifurcation determined if possible, and any fluid or a mass adjacent to the aorta documented and reported, with a comprehensive study requested to follow-up abnormal measurements.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® palpable abdominal mass-suspected neoplasm [^115Fve7L]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Palpable abdominal masses may arise from the abdominal cavity or the abdominal wall. The differential diagnosis is broad for each variant ranging from benign lipomas, inflammatory processes, to malignant tumors. The imaging approach to diagnosis varies by location. For intra-abdominal masses, contrast-enhanced CT and ultrasound examination have demonstrated accuracy. For abdominal wall masses, which may arise from muscle, subcutaneous tissue, or connective tissue, MRI, CT, and ultrasound all provide diagnostic value. This publication reviews the current evidence supporting the imaging approach to diagnosis of palpable abdominal masses for two variants: suspected intra-abdominal neoplasm and suspected abdominal wall masses. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

Obstruction of the upper gastrointestinal tract caused by an abdominal aortic aneurysm (aortoduodenal syndrome) has been rarely reported. The typical presentation includes protracted emesis in a patient with a pulsatile abdominal mass. Clinical features of weight loss, abdominal pain, and distention are present less frequently. The diagnosis is suggested by findings on computed tomography scans, and may be confirmed with upper gastrointestinal contrast material-enhanced studies or upper endoscopy. Aortic aneurysmorrhaphy is curative, and should be undertaken after gastrointestinal decompression and correction of fluid and electrolyte disturbances. We report 2 cases of abdominal aortic aneurysm producing upper gastrointestinal obstruction, and provide a review of the literature relevant to this clinical syndrome.

### Primary omental torsion (POT): a review of literature and case report [^115dg9Nv]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

POT is a rare pathological condition which presents with generic symptoms, and may mimic a variety of acute abdominal conditions such as cholecystitis, acute diverticulitis, appendicitis and Meckel diverticulum. The pathogenesis of POT with infarction has not been established, however, some anatomical malformations and anomalies are recognized as predisposing factors to OT: presence in the great omentum of tongue-like projections and bifid and accessory omentum, anomalous vascular blood supply, other vascular anomalies that modify the weight of the omentum, vascular kinking, irregular omental pad, mostly in obese patients. SOT is more common than POT and is associated with pre-existing abdominal pathologies, including cysts, tumours, foci of intra abdominal inflammations and surgical wounds or scarring and hernial sacs. Most cases of SOT occur in patients with inguinal hernia as reported by Morris et al. Mentioned in literature as precipitant factors are trauma of the abdominal wall, coughing, effect of lifting, bicycle racing, hard labour, ingestion of heavy meals, hyperperistalsys, violent purgation or the taxis of an hernia, causes of passive displacement of the omentum. The OT determines the omentum twists around a pivotal point, usually in a clockwise direction. Engorgement of the tortuous veins that are more easily compressed may compromise venous return, and the distal omentum becomes congested and oedematous. Recovery may follow or the process may go on. Resultant hemorrhagic extravasations create a characteristic serosanguineous fluid inside the great omentum and in the peritoneal cavity. As the torsion progresses, arterial occlusion leads to acute hemorrhagic infarction and eventual necrosis of the omentum occur. Furthermore omental infarction can occur without torsion due to hypercoagulable state or vascular abnormalities predisposing to thrombosis. Vasculitis or congestion of mesenteric veins may be caused by right sided heart failure. The differential diagnosis between POT and SOT is difficult and has seldom been made during the operation. Helpful is US or CT scan. Usually US findings are evaluated as normal. Some times US may show a complex mass or a mixture of solid material and hypoechoic zones. US is a diagnostic procedure useful to exclude other acute abdominal conditions. CT scan is an effective procedure in diagnosis of acute abdominal torsion. Preoperative US or CT scan are mandatory and the preoperative diagnosis can be accurately accomplished by these procedures. With increased use of US and CT scan, preoperative diagnosis of POT may increased in frequency and in selected cases can avoid surgery and lead to conservative treatment. In practice, US and CT scan are often avoided only for economical reasons. CT scan of our patient showed an inhomogeneous irregular edge profile mass of 38×30×25 cm of omental appearance localized at the right side. Concentric distribution of fibrous and fatty folds converging radially toward the torsion with oedema of the fat tissue, of the mesentery and little fluid collection between the right muscle wall and the lower liver surface were shown. The same pattern of concentric linear streaks in the omental fat with high-attenuated vascular structure of omentum running perpendicular to the axial plane at the centre of a concentrically layered streaks was observed by Sakamoto et al. In their report, CT scan showed also a closed vascular pedicle. Balthazar et al. showed effective also the MRI specially when OT is complicated by bleeding or development of an abscess. Conversely, the radiography studies are ineffective in differential diagnosis between infarction of great omentum and infarction caused by torsion. OT is usually diagnosed during explorative laparotomy that represents diagnostic and therapeutic procedure. Thus, laparoscopy is the first choice procedure for diagnosis and treatment of acute omental torsion. This procedure permits definitive diagnosis, when US and imaging (CT and MRI) findings are unclear. In all cases laparoscopy permits a correct diagnosis of omental infarction and surgical excision. The minimally invasive access to the abdominal cavity without surgical incision evocates less pain than traditional procedure and permits a praecox discharge of the patient in the first postoperative day. Furthermore, in cases of POT with extensive mass of omentum, the laparoscopic technique alone might require to long surgery time; in such cases the therapeutic management of choice is diagnostic laparoscopy proceeding to laparotomy, which can permit the omental excision with small abdominal incision.

### Systematic review: emergency department bedside ultrasonography for diagnosing suspected abdominal aortic aneurysm [^116Hrtmo]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The use of ultrasound (US) to diagnose an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) has been well studied in the radiology literature, but has yet to be rigorously reviewed in the emergency medicine arena.

Objectives

This was a systematic review of the literature for the operating characteristics of emergency department (ED) ultrasonography for AAA.

Methods

The authors searched PubMed and EMBASE databases for trials from 1965 through November 2011 using a search strategy derived from the following PICO formulation: Patients-patients (18+ years) suspected of AAA. Intervention-bedside ED US to detect AAA. Comparator-reference standard for diagnosing an AAA was a computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), aortography, official US performed by radiology, ED US reviewed by radiology, exploratory laparotomy, or autopsy results. AAA was defined as ≥ 3 cm dilation of the aorta. Outcome-operating characteristics (sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios [LR]) of ED abdominal US. The papers were analyzed using Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS) guidelines.

Results

The initial search strategy identified 1,238 articles; application of inclusion/exclusion criteria resulted in seven studies with 655 patients. The weighted average prevalence of AAA in symptomatic patients over the age of 50 years is 23%. On history, 50% of AAA patients will lack the classic triad of hypotension, back pain, and pulsatile abdominal mass. The sensitivity of abdominal palpation for AAA increases as the diameter of the AAA increases. The pooled operating characteristics of ED US for the detection of AAA were sensitivity 99% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 96% to 100%) and specificity 98% (95% CI = 97% to 99%).

Conclusions

Seven high-quality studies of the operating characteristics of ED bedside US in diagnosing AAA were identified. All showed excellent diagnostic performance for emergency bedside US to detect the presence of AAA in symptomatic patients.

### The Society for Vascular Surgery practice guidelines on the care of patients with an abdominal aortic aneurysm [^114AZ6Gu]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) timing of intervention — symptomatic evaluation and rupture risk by size: For a known AAA with acute symptoms but without hemodynamic instability, "A patient with a known AAA or pulsatile mass on abdominal examination who presents without hemodynamic instability and acute onset of back or abdominal pain should undergo an immediate CT scan to determine whether rupture has occurred". In selected stable symptomatic cases, "it may be appropriate to delay intervention for several hours" and "the patient should be closely monitored in an ICU". For asymptomatic large aneurysms, "A more frequent concern is the timing for treatment of an asymptomatic, large AAA, > 5.4 cm in diameter". Size-based rupture risk estimates include "rupture risk was estimated at 10% per year for aneurysms between 5.5 and 6.9 cm in diameter but > 33% per year when aneurysms were 7 cm or larger in diameter", while more contemporary pooled data report "a rupture risk of 6.3% per year for aneurysms > 7 cm in diameter".

### Giant pedunculated hepatoblastoma mimicking neuroblastoma in a 4-month-old infant: a case report [^111ZnGko]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hepatoblastoma is the most common primary malignancy of liver origin in children, with an estimated incidence of 0.5–1.5 per million children from birth to 14 years of age. It occurs more in males than females with a M:F = 1.6:1.0. The congenital form of hepatoblastoma, which accounts for less than 10% of pediatric hepatoblastomas, is found in utero or within the first 28 days after birth. In infants, hepatoblastoma usually presents with acute abdominal distension and palpable abdominal mass, and respiratory distress.

Pediatric hepatoblastoma is diagnosed using laboratory markers and imaging studies, but a definitive diagnosis is based on pathological examination. A common tumor marker for hepatoblastoma screening and diagnosis is alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). It increases in approximately 90% of cases. However, AFP is not sensitive or specific to hepatoblastoma and is also elevated in other liver malignancies. Beta-Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (β-HCG) is increased in about 20% of patients. Ultrasound and CT scans are usually performed on children suspected of having abdominal masses. These imaging studies are critical to narrow down the differential diagnosis.

Pedunculated hepatoblastoma is a relatively rare subtype of hepatoblastoma that is characterized by a tumor mass attached to the liver by a pedicle or stalk and to the best of our knowledge, few cases have been reported in the literature.

The diagnosis of pedunculated hepatoblastoma can be challenging as there is difficulty in determining the origin of the mass as the thin peduncle/stalk may be unrecognizable on imaging.

Here, we report a four-month-old male infant with a large, asymptomatic, palpable abdominal mass, initially thought to be neuroblastoma, but later diagnosed as a pedunculated hepatoblastoma.

### Common iliac artery tortuosity simulating aortic dissection on focused abdominal ultrasound in the emergency department [^117L1Yjz]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Bedside ultrasonography performed by the Emergency Physician is a safe procedure for evaluating patients with trauma, hypotension, chest or abdominal pain, and dyspnea of unknown origin.

Objectives

To present a case with apparent concordance between the patient's history, symptoms, signs, and ultrasound imaging, that lead to diagnostic error.

Case Report

A 74-year-old man was admitted to the hospital due to epigastric pain, radiating to the back. He reported previous detection of a small dilatation in the ascending aorta. On physical examination, the heart rate was 120 beats/min and the blood pressure was 90/60 mm Hg. These facts suggested the possibility of an aortic dissection; therefore, a bedside emergency ultrasound examination was performed. The first part of the examination focused on the ascending aorta, but the results were not significant. Then, an abdominal evaluation was performed that revealed an ovular and pulsatile anechoic mass in the infrarenal tract, with an echoic wall and an endoluminal flap. A computed tomography scan of the aorta was ordered, and it showed a regular aorta in the entire tract, with an abnormal tortuosity of iliac arteries as the basis of the false-positive ultrasound.

Conclusions

The use of ultrasound in emergency settings has improved the clinical evaluation of critical patients by Emergency Physicians, but the possibility of a false-positive diagnostic error always should be considered.

### A pelvic mass… [^115ftiSg]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

An 86-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with worsening pain in the left groin and a two-day history of nausea and poor oral intake. She had been in fair health until the day before, when she presented to her private physician with pain in her left groin and occasional abdominal discomfort, but no vomiting, fever or change in bowel habits. She had a past history of hypertension, peptic ulcer disease, rheumatic heart disease and diverticular disease that required a colostomy. On physical examination, the patient was afebrile with normal vital signs. Her abdomen was soft with hypoactive bowel sounds; no palpable masses or lesions were noted. She had mild tenderness but no guarding or rebound on palpation of the left groin region. Results from laboratory tests were unremarkable. A plain abdominal radiograph showed a few dilated loops of small bowel but no air-fluid levels. The findings of a computed tomographic scan are shown in the accompanying figure.

1 Obturator hernias have the highest mortality rate of all abdominal wall hernias. 2 They typically manifest as a small bowel obstruction with cramping, abdominal pain and vomiting, when the hernia passes through the obturator foramen or canal. The most specific finding for an obturator hernia is pain that extends down the medial aspect of the thigh on abduction, extension or internal rotation of the lower extremity. This is referred to as a positive Howship-Romberg sign. 3 A mass may be palpated on rectal examination if the hernia sac is incarcerated or strangulated. Since Howship-Romberg sign is present in less than one half of patients, physicians should suspect an obturator hernia in any elderly debilitated woman with any degree of bowel obstruction. A CT scan is the study of choice for diagnosis of an otherwise stable patient. Adhesions from previous surgeries are the most common cause of mechanical obstruction of the small bowel.

Patients presenting with small bowel obstruction secondary to adhesions typically have colicky abdominal pain, vomiting and abdominal distention. Dilated loops of small intestine can be seen on radiographs in these patients; however, masses, such as those found on the CT shown here, will not be present. A follow-through radiographic series of the small bowel should reveal the obstruction higher in the abdomen.

### Obstructive jaundice caused by a large intact abdominal aortic aneurysm. case report and literature review [^114iwrmx]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Obstructive jaundice caused by abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is an extremely rare clinical presentation. We present an 85-year-old male with a large intact AAA causing obstructive jaundice and review the relevant literature.

Methods and Results

The patient was referred to our hospital with jaundice and a palpable pulsatile abdominal mass. Computerized tomography (CT) angiogram and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) revealed an infrarenal AAA with maximal diameter of 8.5 cm compressing the pancreatic head and common bile duct, causing obstructive jaundice with elevated levels of total, and direct bilirubin. The patient was subjected to endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). Blood bilirubin gradually decreased to normal levels. No complications were reported during the immediate postoperative and at 3-month follow up period. Literature review suggests that our case is one of the largest intact AAAs which have been reported to cause biliary obstruction.

Conclusions

AAAs causing secondary obstructive jaundice is an uncommon clinical presentation requiring high clinical suspicion during differential diagnosis, so that patients can receive proper and early diagnosis and treatment.

### Adult pancreatic cavernous hemangioma: case presentation of a benign tumor with a complex composition [^111fShXv]. BMC Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

Vascular tumors include lymphangiomas, hemangiomas, lymphangiomas, angiotheliomas, angioblastomas, and angiosarcomas, are of which all cystic lesions. As a benign neoplastic lesion with slow growth and rarely malignant changes, these lesions are commonly found in the skin, eyes, liver, brain, spleen and other organs, while cavernous hemangioma occurring in the pancreas is extremely rare. Pancreatic cavernous hemangioma is more common in women than in men (the male to female ratio is 1:3), the exact cause of the disease is unknown, and it is mostly recognized as a congenital disease. The age of the patients at diagnosis ranges from 18 to 79 years, and it occurs more frequently in childhood than adulthood. It progresses slowly to the stage of degeneration after hyperplasia in infancy and gradually disappears after many years, leaving traces of fiber and fat in adulthood. Adult pancreatic hemangioma is very rare, and its pathological nature is completely different from that of childhood pancreatic hemangioma.

Cavernous hemangioma of the pancreas shows no typical clinical symptoms, and the majority of patients experience pain and discomfort in the middle and upper abdomen. Nausea, abdominal distention, fever, episodic dizziness and palpitations may be associated with pain. Some patients come to hospital because of low back pain, a palpable abdominal mass or gastrointestinal bleeding. Occasionally, it may be diagnosed from incidental findings on an imaging examination during a physical examination. Neither episodes of pancreatitis nor a family history of pancreatic diseases has been reported before. It may rarely be observed in the setting of von Hippel-Lindau disease, especially in young patients.

The imaging manifestations of pancreatic cavernous hemangioma are diverse. Abdominal X-ray and cholangiography are of little significance in the diagnosis of pancreatic cavernous hemangioma, while digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is invasive and rarely used. Pancreatic cavernous hemangioma is usually characterized by ultrasonography as well demarcated and appearing overall hyper- or isoechogenic to the rest of the pancreas with mixed echogenicity or an irregular low echo and usually no blood flow signal or a low-velocity blood flow signal. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound has revealed that cavernous hemangiomas are typically rich in blood supply, but a large portion of pancreatic cavernous hemangiomas do not show obvious enhancement, so the nature of the lesion cannot be determined.

### Accuracy of presenting symptoms, physical examination, and imaging for diagnosis of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm: systematic review and meta-analysis [^113rmKkK]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (rAAA) is a life-threatening condition, and rapid diagnosis is necessary to facilitate early surgical intervention. We sought to evaluate the accuracy of presenting symptoms, physical examination signs, computed tomography with angiography (CTA), and point-of-care ultrasound (PoCUS) for diagnosis of rAAA.

Methods

We searched six databases from inception through April 2021. We included studies investigating the accuracy of any of the above tests for diagnosis of rAAA. The primary reference standard used in all studies was intraoperative diagnosis or death from rAAA. Because PoCUS cannot detect rupture, we secondarily assessed its accuracy for the diagnosis of AAA, using the reference standard of intraoperative or CTA diagnosis. We used GRADE to assess certainty in estimates.

Results

We included 20 studies (2,077 patients), with 11 of these evaluating signs and symptoms, seven evaluating CTA, and five evaluating PoCUS. Pooled sensitivities of abdominal pain, back pain, and syncope for rAAA were 61.7%, 53.6%, and 27.8%, respectively (low certainty). Pooled sensitivity of hypotension and pulsatile abdominal mass were 30.9% and 47.1%, respectively (low certainty). CTA had a sensitivity of 91.4% and specificity of 93.6% for diagnosis of rAAA (moderate certainty). In our secondary analysis, PoCUS had a sensitivity of 97.8% and specificity of 97.0% for diagnosing AAA in patients suspected of having rAAA (moderate certainty).

Conclusions

Classic clinical symptoms associated with rAAA have poor sensitivity, and their absence does not rule out the condition. CTA has reasonable accuracy, but misses some cases of rAAA. PoCUS is a valuable tool that can help guide the need for urgent transfer to a vascular center in patients suspected of having rAAA.

Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2017). Medium credibility.

Neonatal cholestasis — key physical examination findings include that ill appearance may indicate infection or metabolic disease, whereas infants with biliary atresia typically appear well; dysmorphic features may reflect Alagille syndrome with characteristic facial appearance and typical facial features that may appear at around 6 months of age; cardiac examination findings include murmur and signs of heart failure and congenital heart disease associations; abdominal examination includes assessment for presence of ascites, abdominal wall veins, liver and spleen size and consistency, abdominal masses, and umbilical hernia; stool examination is crucial and acholic or hypopigmented stools suggest cholestasis or biliary obstruction; and neurologic examination includes noting overall vigor and tone.

Initial evaluation of a child with a suspicious abdomen mass — History and physical examination including blood pressure, assessment for congenital anomalies, and screening for genetic predisposition conditions are recommended. Blood tests, including a complete blood count (CBC) with differential and a comprehensive metabolic panel, should be performed along with urinalysis (UA) and evaluation of urine homovanillic acid (HVA) and vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) to rule out neuroblastoma. An assessment of coagulation with consideration of screening for prothrombin time/partial thromboplastin time (PT/PTT) should also be performed, with further workup for von Willebrand disease if PT/PTT is abnormal, as almost 10% of patients with Wilms tumor have an acquired form. Imaging including abdominal ultrasound (US), CT, or MRI of abdomen/pelvis with intravenous contrast and non-sedated chest CT with or without contrast are part of the initial evaluation, and oncofertility counseling should also be considered. The goal of imaging at diagnosis is to differentiate primary kidney tumors from extra-kidney and benign kidney conditions, determine unilateral or bilateral kidney disease, and assess for metastases and ascites. Abdominal US is typically the first imaging modality utilized for real-time evaluation and venous thrombus assessment; chest CT has long been standard for lung metastases, but radiation exposure should be limited as much as possible, and chest MRI is another alternative for evaluating potential lung metastasis.

### Diagnosis and management of adnexal masses [^112YtQNm]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Adnexal masses represent a spectrum of conditions from gynecologic and nongynecologic sources. They may be benign or malignant. The initial detection and evaluation of an adnexal mass requires a high index of suspicion, a thorough history and physical examination, and careful attention to subtle historical clues. Timely, appropriate laboratory and radiographic studies are required. The most common symptoms reported by women with ovarian cancer are pelvic or abdominal pain; increased abdominal size; bloating; urinary urgency, frequency, or incontinence; early satiety; difficulty eating; and weight loss. These vague symptoms are present for months in up to 93 percent of patients with ovarian cancer. Any of these symptoms occurring daily for more than two weeks, or with failure to respond to appropriate therapy warrant further evaluation. Transvaginal ultrasonography remains the standard for evaluation of adnexal masses. Findings suggestive of malignancy in an adnexal mass include a solid component, thick septations (greater than 2 to 3 mm), bilaterality, Doppler flow to the solid component of the mass, and presence of ascites. Family physicians can manage many nonmalignant adnexal masses; however, prepubescent girls and postmenopausal women with an adnexal mass should be referred to a gynecologist or gynecologic oncologist for further treatment. All women, regardless of menopausal status, should be referred if they have evidence of metastatic disease, ascites, a complex mass, an adnexal mass greater than 10 cm, or any mass that persists longer than 12 weeks.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) recognition after prior repair — cholecystitis, appendicitis, or pancreatitis may mimic the presentation of a symptomatic aneurysm; when a pulsatile mass is discovered in a patient after prior open surgical repair (OSR) of an AAA, the presence of an anastomotic pseudoaneurysm, iliac artery aneurysm, or suprarenal aortic aneurysm should be considered, and abdominal or back pain after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) should also prompt evaluation of potential aneurysm expansion or rupture.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for ectopic pregnancy, more specifically with respect to transvaginal ultrasound (abdominal pregnancy), RCOG 2016 guidelines recommend to consider using the following ultrasound criteria for the diagnosis of abdominal pregnancy:

- absence of an intrauterine gestational sac

- absence of both an evident dilated tube and a complex adnexal mass

- gestational cavity surrounded by loops of bowel and separated from them by peritoneum

- wide mobility similar to the fluctuation of the sac, particularly evident with the pressure of the transvaginal probe toward the posterior cul-de-sac.

### Papillary fibroelastoma of the left atrial wall: a case report [^114uD9cN]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Case report

A seventy-two year old man was hospitalized in the Department of Neurology for the treatment and investigation of etiology for his ischemic cerebral event. Physical examination was unremarkable except monoparesis of the right upper extremity, right fascial paralysis and a pulsatile abdominal mass. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed a 0.7 × 0.7 cm mobile mass attached to the left atrial wall at the base of the anterior mitral leaflet. A transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) was performed for the differential diagnosis, and revealed a mass measuring 1.2 × 0.8 cm, which was attached to the left atrial wall at the level of the aortic non-coronary leaflet. Pre-operative diagnosis according to TEE was pedinculated left atrial myxoma (Figure 1). An infra-renal abdominal aortic aneurysm was also diagnosed after a thoracoabdominal computed tomography. The patient was scheduled for surgical treatment 6 weeks after his ischemic neurologic event.

Figure 1

The operation was performed under normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass using ascending aortic and bicaval cannulation. After cardiac arrest with antegrade cardioplegia, left atrium was opened by extended vertical transatrial septal (Guiraudon) incision for optimal surgical exposure. A 1-cm, gelatinous and solid looking mass (Figure 2) was found attached to the left atrial wall near the posteromedial mitral commisure. It was resected with its stalk, and the fenestration was directly closed. The resected mass changed its shape in water to an arboreous, plushy and sea-anemon like tumor. Per-operative TEE confirmed normal valvular functions and absence of residual left atrial mass.

Figure 2
Macroscopic images of the resected tumor in and out of water. The anemon-like appearance is classic for papillary fibroelastomae, which looks like a solid tumor out of water.

Histologic examination of the resected tumor revealed a papillary proliferation including few fibroblasts and collagenous tissue, covered with endothelial cells (Figure 3). These morphologic and histologic findings warranted the diagnosis of PFE. The early postoperative period was uncomplicated, and the patient was discharged on postoperative day-10.

### Detection and characterization of adnexal masses [^116jE4EG]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

The main challenge to the radiologist is to differentiate benign from malignant adnexal masses. Both US and MRI perform well for prediction of benignity. There is less specificity for diagnosis of malignancy but features, such as papillary projections, thickened septations, and internal vascularity within nodules, aid in this differentiation. The combination of morphology and Doppler characteristics provide the most accurate US diagnosis. For sonographically indeterminate masses, MRI is useful for additional lesion characterization. Analysis of T1- and T2-weighted signal intensities for benign-appearing lesions with the addition of fat saturation for high signal on T1-weighted sequences may lead to an exact diagnosis or a narrow differential. For cases considered suspicious by TVUS, more specific diagnosis by MRI may obviate the need for surgery or otherwise change management by identification of benign etiology.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2012). Medium credibility.

Peripheral vascular ultrasound — summary of evidence and appropriateness ratings indicate the following: A consensus of "appropriate" was found for most vascular studies where clinical signs and symptoms were the indication for testing and to establish a "baseline" after a revascularization procedure, whereas a follow-up study for a patient with a normal baseline study was deemed inappropriate. In cerebrovascular disease, a duplex ultrasound study was deemed appropriate for hemispheric neurological symptoms such as transient ischemic attack or stroke; there was uncertainty for assessment of asymptomatic patients with risk factors or comorbidities for carotid artery stenosis, and another area considered uncertain was preoperative assessment prior to cardiac surgery. For renal artery stenosis, appropriate testing indications were hypertension, increased creatinine, and heart failure, and for mesenteric artery stenosis they were patients with postprandial pain and weight loss who have previously undergone GI evaluation; appropriate indications for evaluation of the abdominal aorta and iliac arteries include intermittent claudication, an aneurysmal femoral or popliteal pulse, a pulsatile abdominal mass, and a decreased or absent femoral pulse.

### Solid malignant retroperitoneal masses-a pictorial review [^113Tw3b5]. Insights Into Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Solitary fibrous tumour

Solitary fibrous tumours (SFTs) are a rare group of neoplasms, which arise from the mesenchyme and account for less than 2% of all soft-tissue tumours. Originally thought to exclusively arise from the pleura, it is now recognised that SFTs can arise from any site of the body and extrapleural SFTs are now thought to be more common. Most haemangiopericytomas are now classified as SFTs according to the World Health Organisation classification of soft-tissue tumours.

SFTs of the retroperitoneum are even more rare and only about 50 cases have previously been described in the literature. Clinical presentation typically relates to the mass itself, i.e. palpable abdominal mass, pressure symptoms or may be detected incidentally. Up to 5% of patients may present with hypoglycaemia, a symptom that is caused by excessive production of insulin growth factor 2 by the tumour itself. They are usually benign, slow growing masses, though malignant SFTs are known to occur de novo or dedifferentiate from benign SFTs. Extra-pleural SFTs in certain locations, such as the abdominal wall and liver have been found predominantly in female patients (Fig. 4a).

Fig. 4
Imaging of solitary fibrous tumour (SFT). a A 40-year-old woman with a palpable abdominal wall. CT showed an intensely enhancing mass (arrow). SFTs in certain locations, such as the abdominal wall and the liver, are predominantly seen in female patients. b, c A 63-year-old man with a long-standing history of back pain. MRI of the spine incidentally picked up a mass in the retroperitoneum and CT of the abdomen was performed. Axial (b) contrast-enhanced CT shows a left sided large heterogeneous retroperitoneal mass (arrow) showing enhancement with central necrotic area, which is displacing and compressing the adjacent kidney causing mild hydronephrosis (arrowhead). Coronal CT (c) in the same patient shows the large mass causing distortion of the left kidney and left renal vessels

At imaging, SFTs usually appear as well-defined masses with intense heterogeneous enhancement in the arterial phase, indicating its hypervascular nature, which persists in the delayed phase because of the fibrous component in the mass. Areas of necrosis, haemorrhage or cystic changes may be seen, though calcification is rare (Fig. 4b, c). On MRI, multiple flow voids representing vascular channels may be identified on T2-weighted images.
