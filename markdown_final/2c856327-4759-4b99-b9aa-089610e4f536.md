## Question

What is the differential diagnosis for flank pain?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the differential diagnosis of flank pain. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate red flags and time-sensitive emergencies. Then, I should consider the most common cause, which is urolithiasis, while guarding against anchoring. Next, I will systematically review genitourinary and non-genitourinary etiologies, interpret key laboratory findings, and map an imaging algorithm tailored to special populations. Finally, I will prioritize the differential, outline initial management including analgesia and decompression when indicated, and note medication-induced mimics, verifying each step against high-quality guidelines and data as I go.

> Let me first confirm the red flags that mandate immediate attention and potential emergent imaging or intervention. Hemodynamic instability, sudden severe pain with a pulsatile abdominal mass suggesting abdominal aortic aneurysm, fever with suspected obstructed infection, and recent significant trauma require rapid recognition and escalation; I should ensure I do not miss peritoneal signs or a rapidly expanding retroperitoneal hemorrhage, especially in older patients at higher AAA risk and in trauma with potential renal injury [^1177iMjD] [^1165MG76] [^116hCtoc].

> Now, I will consider the most likely diagnosis while avoiding premature closure. Urolithiasis accounts for a large proportion of acute flank pain presentations, typically with colicky pain radiating to the groin and frequent microhematuria, but wait, I should double-check the data because absence of hematuria does not rule out stones, and the STONE score can refine pretest probability and reduce unnecessary imaging in high-likelihood cases [^1151qP1t] [^114KVLtP] [^114sk6Tz].

> Next, I should review first-line imaging for suspected stones. Non-contrast CT is highly sensitive and specific and remains the general diagnostic reference, but hold on, I should verify exceptions, because in pregnancy and children ultrasound is preferred initially with MR urography or low-dose CT reserved for inconclusive cases; I must balance radiation risk, diagnostic yield, and clinical context rather than reflexively ordering CT for everyone [^112vwgDG] [^114sk6Tz] [^1133mYfn].

> I need to ensure my laboratory interpretation supports and refines the differential rather than anchoring it. Microhematuria increases the likelihood of stones but is neither necessary nor sufficient, pyuria and positive urine cultures push me toward pyelonephritis, marked elevation in LDH strongly suggests renal infarction, and a positive β-hCG should reconsider ectopic pregnancy; let me verify that in suspected acute kidney injury I take a careful history and exam to classify prerenal, intrinsic, or postrenal etiologies in parallel with imaging as indicated [^1151qP1t] [^117SEQxU] [^116jRP38] [^113bGqC5].

> Hold on, I should review infectious and inflammatory GU causes that can mimic stones or coexist with obstruction. Acute pyelonephritis presents with fever, CVA tenderness, and pyuria, while emphysematous pyelonephritis and perinephric abscess occur in high-risk patients and demand early imaging and source control; I need to check myself here, because fever with suspected obstructed infection is a urologic emergency requiring prompt decompression in addition to antibiotics and resuscitation [^117SEQxU] [^117TmLyE].

> I will now examine vascular etiologies that are time-sensitive and often underrecognized. Renal artery infarction presents with sudden severe flank pain and often markedly elevated LDH, and CTA is the diagnostic study of choice; renal vein thrombosis can mimic stone disease on ultrasound or even noncontrast CT, so if the shape or behavior of a "calculus" is atypical I should verify with CTA, and I must remember that hematuria may be absent in a significant fraction of renal infarctions [^116jRP38] [^112j39SF] [^113rpeNw].

> Let me consider structural and pressure-related entities that produce flank pain. Page kidney from a subcapsular hematoma or mass compresses the renal parenchyma leading to flank pain and secondary hypertension, often post-trauma or procedure, and I should confirm with CT and blood pressure assessment; congenital or acquired obstruction such as UPJ obstruction, ureterocele, or cystic disease may present with intermittent pain or complications, and targeted imaging clarifies the anatomy [^116V2XXA] [^116kWkn6] [^116vRrN4].

> I should not forget neoplastic mimics and tumor-related pain. Renal and urothelial malignancies can cause persistent flank pain with or without hematuria, while renal lymphoma and even vascular malformations can masquerade as solid masses; careful multiphasic CT or MRI and, when appropriate, angiography or PET guide differentiation and subsequent management, so I need to check enhancement patterns and vascular flow characteristics rather than assuming stone disease [^115TV4RF] [^115n8kBA].

> But wait, what if the source is extraurinary. Pancreatitis of the tail can present solely as left flank pain and may be initially misattributed to renal causes, and appendicitis, diverticulitis, lower lobe pneumonia, and pulmonary embolism can all produce flank pain syndromes; I should verify gastrointestinal, respiratory, and thromboembolic clues in the history, labs, and imaging to avoid anchoring on the urinary tract [^116RsY8r] [^114Hh4Ji] [^115TV4Jx].

> Next, I should review special populations because my thresholds and modalities change. In pregnancy, ultrasound is first-line and MR urography without contrast is a safe second-line when ultrasound is inconclusive, while in the elderly the pretest probability of AAA, malignancy, and vascular events rises and justifies a lower threshold for CTA; in ESRD or acquired cystic kidney disease, spontaneous renal hemorrhage can present with flank pain and hypotension, so I must verify rapidly with CT to guide hemostasis [^112vwgDG] [^111kJADE] [^115ZPJdF].

> I should confirm the imaging algorithm and its diagnostic yield, especially the capacity to reveal alternative diagnoses. Unenhanced CT for suspected stones is highly accurate but also frequently shows additional or alternative findings, including acutely important non-stone causes, so I need to deploy it judiciously where it will change management and consider ultrasound first in low-risk or radiation-sensitive patients while recognizing that US and CT have comparable accuracy for some nonlithiasic causes in experienced hands [^1176YLnq] [^1153kQMC] [^116F1Q4Z].

> Let me think about initial management while I finish the workup. For renal colic, NSAIDs are first-line analgesics when not contraindicated, and if pain is refractory or NSAIDs are unsuitable, opioids are a second-line option; I need to check for infected obstruction because that requires urgent decompression, and I should remember that if I am confident clinically in uncomplicated renal colic, CT may not alter immediate management and can sometimes be deferred with careful follow-up [^114PbYay] [^115yfGfM] [^117TmLyE] [^115LziJq].

> I should also review medication-induced contributors that can mislead if I do not ask a thorough history. Probenecid and related uricosurics can provoke uric acid stone formation and renal colic with hematuria, mitigated by urine alkalinization and hydration, so I need to ensure I screen for these drugs and counsel accordingly while confirming the diagnosis with appropriate imaging and labs [^111Twsu2].

> Hold on, let me synthesize and prioritize the differential to avoid diagnostic anchoring. First exclude life threats such as ruptured or leaking AAA, infected obstructed urinary system, and renal infarction or venous thrombosis, then address the common and morbid genitourinary causes including stones and pyelonephritis, and finally keep non-GU etiologies like pancreatitis, pneumonia, and PE on the radar; I should double-check that my imaging sequence fits the patient's risk profile and that I have not overused CT when ultrasound and clinical prediction can safely guide care, especially in pregnancy and pediatric patients [^114sk6Tz] [^112vwgDG] [^1153kQMC].

Flank pain has a broad differential, but the most common causes are **urolithiasis** [^114sk6Tz] and **pyelonephritis** [^117SEQxU]. Other important etiologies include renal infarction [^116jRP38], renal vein thrombosis [^112mUpVE], abdominal aortic aneurysm [^1177iMjD], musculoskeletal strain [^114Hh4Ji], and gastrointestinal or gynecologic conditions. Initial evaluation should include a **focused history**, **physical exam**, **urinalysis**, and **basic labs** [^114KVLtP]. Non-contrast CT is the **first-line imaging** [^114sk6Tz] for suspected stones, whereas ultrasound is preferred in pregnancy [^112vwgDG] or when radiation is a concern. Management is guided by the underlying cause — NSAIDs for renal colic [^114PbYay], antibiotics for infection [^117SEQxU], and urgent intervention for infected obstructing stones or vascular emergencies.

## Common causes of flank pain

### Urologic causes

- **Nephrolithiasis (kidney stones)**: Sudden, severe, colicky pain radiating to the groin [^114KVLtP], often with hematuria and nausea/vomiting [^1151qP1t].
- **Pyelonephritis**: Flank pain with fever, chills, dysuria, and costovertebral angle tenderness [^117SEQxU].
- **Renal infarction**: Sudden severe flank pain, hematuria, and elevated LDH [^116jRP38]; often associated with atrial fibrillation or hypercoagulable states [^112j39SF].
- **Renal vein thrombosis**: Flank pain, hematuria, and renal dysfunction [^112mUpVE]; often associated with nephrotic syndrome or hypercoagulable states.
- **Polycystic kidney disease**: Chronic flank pain, hematuria, and hypertension due to renal cysts [^116vRrN4].

---

### Vascular causes

Vascular causes include **Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)** — presenting with severe flank or abdominal pain, a pulsatile abdominal mass, hypotension, and shock [^1177iMjD] — and **Renal artery aneurysm**, which causes flank pain and hypertension and carries a risk of rupture [^113Ju8hd].

---

### Musculoskeletal causes

Musculoskeletal causes include **Muscle strain or spasm** [^114Hh4Ji], which produces localized flank pain that worsens with movement or palpation, and **Rib fracture**, where pain typically follows trauma [^1165MG76].

---

### Gastrointestinal causes

Gastrointestinal causes include **pancreatitis**, presenting with flank pain radiating to the back, nausea, vomiting, and elevated pancreatic enzymes [^116RsY8r]. **Diverticulitis** typically causes left-sided flank pain with fever and gastrointestinal symptoms, whereas **appendicitis** more often causes right-sided flank pain with similar features [^114Hh4Ji].

---

### Gynecologic causes

Gynecologic causes include **Ovarian cyst rupture**, presenting with sudden flank pain often associated with the menstrual cycle, and **Ectopic pregnancy**, which presents with flank pain plus vaginal bleeding and a positive pregnancy test [^114Hh4Ji].

---

## Clinical evaluation

### History

History should characterize the **onset**, **duration**, and **pain quality** (sudden vs. gradual; colicky vs. constant) and elicit associated symptoms such as fever, hematuria, dysuria, nausea, vomiting, and gastrointestinal complaints [^114KVLtP]. Relevant history includes prior kidney stones or infections, vascular disease, trauma, and pregnancy.

---

### Physical examination

Measure **vital signs** for fever, hypertension, or hypotension. Perform an abdominal exam to assess for tenderness and for a palpable or pulsatile mass [^1177iMjD], and assess for costovertebral angle tenderness suggestive of renal involvement [^117SEQxU]. Include a musculoskeletal exam for flank muscle tenderness or spasm.

---

## Diagnostic imaging

- **Non-contrast CT scan**: First-line imaging [^114sk6Tz] for suspected nephrolithiasis; high sensitivity and specificity [^116tBF7J].
- **Ultrasound**: Preferred initial imaging in pregnant patients [^112vwgDG] or when radiation exposure is a concern.
- **MRI**: Useful in pregnancy [^112vwgDG] or when CT is inconclusive.
- **Contrast-enhanced CT**: Indicated when vascular causes are suspected [^113Ju8hd] or when non-contrast CT is inconclusive [^1133mYfn].

---

## Laboratory tests

Obtain **urinalysis** to evaluate for hematuria, pyuria, and bacteriuria [^117SEQxU]. Order blood tests — CBC, renal function tests, LDH [^116jRP38], and pancreatic enzymes [^116RsY8r] — and perform a pregnancy test in women of childbearing age [^111kJADE].

---

## Management strategies

- **Nephrolithiasis**: NSAIDs as first-line analgesia [^114PbYay]; opioids as second-line [^115yfGfM]; renal decompression or ureteroscopic stone removal if pain refractory or obstructing stone with infection.
- **Pyelonephritis**: Antibiotics, hydration, and analgesia [^117SEQxU].
- **Renal infarction or thrombosis**: Anticoagulation, thrombolysis, or surgical intervention [^116jRP38].
- **AAA**: Emergent surgical intervention [^1177iMjD].
- **Musculoskeletal pain**: Analgesics, physical therapy, rest [^114Hh4Ji].

---

Flank pain has a **broad differential**, spanning urologic, vascular, musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal, and gynecologic causes. A **focused history**, **physical exam**, and appropriate imaging are essential for accurate diagnosis and management [^1167C6W1].

### Alternate or additional findings to stone disease on unenhanced computerized tomography for acute flank pain can impact management [^1176YLnq]. The Journal of Urology (2006). Low credibility.

We evaluated the incidence and clinical relevance of alternate or additional findings on unenhanced CT in patients with acute flank pain and suspected urinary calculi. A consecutive series of 1,500 patients underwent unenhanced CT due to acute flank pain. The absence or presence of urinary tract calculi and their localization were recorded. Alternate or additional CT findings were classified according to whether they required immediate or deferred treatment, or were of little or no clinical importance.

Of the 1,500 patients, 1,035 (69%) had urinary tract calculi, including 309 (30%) with nephrolithiasis, 377 (36%) with ureterolithiasis, and 349 (34%) with both conditions. Urolithiasis alone was found in 331 of these patients (32%), and additional pathological conditions were noted in 704 (68%). Of all patients, 1,064 (71%) had other or additional CT findings. A total of 207 patients (14%) had nonstone-related CT findings requiring immediate or deferred treatment, 464 (31%) had pathological conditions of little clinical importance, and 393 (26%) had pathological conditions of no clinical relevance. CT was normal in 105 of all patients (7%).

Unenhanced CT in patients with acute flank pain allows the accurate diagnosis of urinary stone disease and it can also provide further important information leading to emergency or deferred treatment in a substantial number of patients.

### Probenecid [^111Twsu2]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Hematuria, renal colic, costovertebral pain, and the formation of uric acid stones associated with the use of probenecid in gouty patients may be prevented by the alkalization of urine and a liberal fluid intake (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). In these cases, when alkali is administered, the acid-base balance of the patient should be monitored.

Use with caution in patients with a history of peptic ulcer. Probenecid has been used in patients with some renal impairment, but dosage requirements may be increased. Probenecid may not be effective in chronic renal insufficiency, particularly when the glomerular filtration rate is 30 mL/minute or less. Because of its mechanism of action, probenecid is not recommended in conjunction with penicillin in the presence of known renal impairment.

A reducing substance may appear in the urine of patients receiving probenecid. This disappears with the discontinuation of therapy. Suspected glycosuria should be confirmed by using a test specific for glucose.

- **Drug interactions**: When probenecid is used to elevate plasma concentrations of penicillin or other beta-lactams, or when such drugs are given to patients taking probenecid therapeutically, high plasma concentrations of the other drug may increase the incidence of adverse reactions associated with that drug. In the case of penicillin or other beta-lactams, psychic disturbances have been reported.

Use of salicylates antagonizes the uricosuric action of probenecid (see WARNINGS). The uricosuric action of probenecid is also antagonized by pyrazinamide.

### Acute renal artery infarction secondary to dysfibrinogenemia [^112j39SF]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

The patient's initial presentation of flank pain has a broad differential diagnosis. Early in the case, nephrolithiasis was the leading diagnosis given the exquisite flank pain that did not resolve with position changes. However, urinalysis did not reveal microscopic haematuria, and a recent non-contrast CT was negative for calculi or hydronephrosis. Given the patient's medical history of rhabdomyolysis and recent intense exercise, acute rhabdomyolysis was also considered but excluded based on a normal creatine kinase level.

With no acute urinary complaints such as hesitancy, frequency, or dysuria, and no objective evidence of infection (no fever, no leucocytosis, benign urinalysis, and no fluid collections on radiography), acute urinary tract infection or occult abscess was low on the differential diagnosis. Prior to the contrast CT, musculoskeletal exacerbation of a previous injury, such as an insult to the psoas or quadratus lumborum muscles, was also considered.

On follow-up imaging, radiology suggested a possible aneurysm, which expanded the differential diagnosis to include infarction due to dissection, in addition to the diagnosis of renal artery infarction due to thrombus formation or embolism. Spontaneous renal artery dissection and/or aneurysm is quite rare, with an incidence of < 0.05%, with approximately only 180 cases having been reported. In a longitudinal study of 438 patients with renal infarction, 21 patients had renal artery dissection or aneurysm, and 29 patients had hypercoagulable states. Given the rarity of the spontaneous dissection and…

### Imaging characteristics of a bladder wall paraganglioma [^113DV3gc]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2019). High credibility.

A 65-year-old man with a history of hypertension and nephrolithiasis presented with flank pain. Urographic CT demonstrated a 1.7-cm nodule arising from the bladder wall. The patient was referred for cystourethroscopy. During the procedure, the patient became hypertensive while under general anesthesia. No biopsy or resection was performed. To work up for possible bladder paraganglioma, an I-MIBG scan was ordered, and the patient was referred to endocrinology. On SPECT/CT images, the bladder nodule demonstrated marked uptake of MIBG radiotracer, confirming the diagnosis of a genitourinary paraganglioma arising from the bladder wall.

### Nutcracker syndrome (a Delphi consensus) [^114XW7Zf]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

Consensus was reached on the combination of clinical signs of NCS and stenosis of the left renal vein being a cause of these symptoms. Flank pain was ranked as the most relevant symptom in NCS, as it is the main symptom differentiating NCS from other causes of pelvic venous disorders. The distinction between NCS and pelvic venous disorders remains a challenge in the diagnostic workup. It is not within the scope of this article to gauge consensus on concomitant NCS and pelvic venous disorders. Further research is needed to standardize the assessment of pelvic venous disorders and NCS.

No consensus was reached on the pathological cause of hematuria and proteinuria in NCS, despite supplying the panel with known theories. The mechanism is unknown. Therefore, statements 1.1.4 and 1.1.5 were removed from the survey after the first round. Furthermore, proteinuria was ranked as the least relevant symptom of NCS because it is most likely to be solely present in a case of kidney injury. It was emphasized that these symptoms individually are nonspecific. Because NCS is not an acute pathology, the persistent character should be checked. Our panel agreed that symptoms of NCS should last ≥ 6 months and that compression should be demonstrated. The mechanism for alternating asymptomatic and symptomatic episodes in NCS remains unknown due to a lack of evidence.

The expert panel agreed on the different diagnostic modalities that can be used in diagnosing NCS, noting that there is no golden standard in the diagnostic process of NCS. Randomized controlled trials and strong multi-institutional collaborations are needed to explore further diagnostic and treatment methods.

Kidney trauma can be associated with conditions such as ascites, dysuria, difficulty urinating, and experiences like motor vehicle accidents. It often involves complications like bladder injury, flank ecchymosis, palpable abdominal mass, and flank pain. Other associated conditions include sepsis, abdominal distension, abdominal trauma, increased serum urea, and ureteral injury.

Furthermore, symptoms may include decreased hematocrit, shock, traumatic injury, rib fracture, pelvic fracture, decreased urine output, increased serum creatinine, notable peritoneal findings, abdominal tenderness, hematuria, pelvic trauma, and decreased hemoglobin.

### Renal vein thrombosis mimicking urinary calculus: a dilemma of diagnosis [^115qgcxk]. BMC Urology (2015). Low credibility.

A 38-year-old woman presented to the emergency room in a regional hospital with nausea and left flank pain that had suddenly started 12 hours earlier. She had a history of left flank trauma, having fallen from a two-meter height five years earlier. Physical examination revealed no tenderness over the abdomen or flank and normal chest auscultation. Blood analysis was within normal limits, except for leukocytosis (12.7 × 10⁹/L). Routine urine analysis showed microscopic hematuria without white blood cells or proteins. Abdominal ultrasonography showed an enlarged kidney and a 16-mm hyperechoic focus in the left renal pelvis, suggesting a diagnosis of renal calculus. The patient was therefore administered extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy at the regional hospital. A follow-up ultrasound examination two weeks later showed that the shape and size of the hyperechoic focus had not changed.

Due to left lower back pain and the persistent left hyperechoic focus in the renal area, the patient was referred to our hospital for further evaluation and treatment. Urine analysis and ultrasound examination showed the same results as in the regional hospital. An abdominal plain film showed a left-sided renal calcification, but there was no evidence of a palpable tender mass or an audible abdominal bruit. Laboratory data, except for urinalysis results, were within normal limits. Because of the failure of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, percutaneous lithotomy was recommended.

### Evaluation and treatment of knee pain: A review [^117KwPXg]. JAMA (2023). High credibility.

Knee pain can result from various causes, including tendinitis, acute bursitis, knee osteoarthritis, and knee injury. Other potential causes are gout, rheumatic fever, ruptured Baker's cyst, Osgood-Schlatter disease, and infrapatellar fat pad syndrome. Conditions such as patellar tendinitis, osteochondritis dissecans, meniscal pathology, chondromalacia patellae, and Sinding-Larsen-Johansson disease also contribute to knee pain.

Additionally, knee pain may arise from rheumatoid arthritis, septic arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, reactive arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis, and Lyme disease. Hemarthrosis, calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease, synovial sarcoma, and osteosarcoma are other factors to consider.

Furthermore, causes include patellofemoral pain syndrome, osteonecrosis, iliotibial band syndrome, fibromyalgia, systemic lupus erythematosus, neuropathic arthropathy of the knee, and tenosynovial giant cell tumor.

### A 43-year-old woman with abdominal pain and fever [^116PVW9q]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Left upper quadrant pain commonly results from various conditions including gastritis, colitis (particularly in the splenic flexure), pancreatitis, pyelonephritis, nephrolithiasis, splenic enlargement or infarction, and left lower lobe pneumonia. Intermittent headaches frequently accompany systemic illnesses, which presents the challenge of determining whether the associated fever signals an intracranial infectious process such as meningitis, encephalitis, or a brain abscess. The severity and duration of the headache, a lack of previous headache history, and the presence of meningeal signs and neurological deficits are common indications for imaging the central nervous system and analyzing the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).

### Modern approach of diagnosis and management of acute flank pain: Review of all imaging modalities [^112Ge6Uv]. European Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Acute flank pain is a common and complex clinical problem which may be caused by a variety of urinary and extraurinary abnormalities, with ureterolithiasis being the most frequent cause. Plain abdominal radiographs combined with intravenous urography (IVU) have been the standard imaging procedures of choice for the evaluation of acute flank pain over the last decades. Direct detection of even small ureteral calculi is achieved in 40–60% of cases, whereas using indirect signs such as ureteral and renal pelvic dilatation, stone detection is possible in up to 80–90% of all cases.

However, IVU might be hampered by poor quality due to a lack of bowel preparation, by nephrotoxicity of contrast agents, and by serious allergic and anaphylactic reactions in 10% and 1% of patients, respectively, as well as by significant radiation exposure. The use of ultrasonography (US) in the management of acute flank pain has been growing. When combining the findings of pyeloureteral dilatation, direct visualization of stones, and the absence of ureteral ejaculation, the sensitivity to detect ureteral dilatation can be as high as 96%.

Recently, unenhanced helical CT (UHCT) has been introduced as an imaging modality with high sensitivity and specificity for the evaluation of acute flank pain. UHCT has been demonstrated to be superior since:

- **Ureteral stones detection**: It detects ureteral stones with sensitivity and specificity from 98% to 100% regardless of size, location, and chemical composition.
- **Identification of extraurinary causes**: It identifies extraurinary causes of flank pain in about one-third of all patients presenting with acute flank pain.

### Stone disease in pregnancy: Imaging-guided therapy [^111kJADE]. Insights into Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Renal colic is the most frequent non-obstetric cause of abdominal pain and subsequent hospitalization during pregnancy. Symptomatic nephrolithiasis complicates 1 in 3,300 pregnancies, with an incidence ranging from 1:200 to 1:1,500. The incidence of symptomatic cases is similar between pregnant and non-pregnant women. The physio-anatomical changes in the urinary tract and the presence of the fetus may complicate the clinical presentation and subsequent management of nephrolithiasis.

Renal colic has been associated with several pregnancy complications, including preterm labor and delivery, abortions, hypertensive disorders, gestational diabetes, and cesarean deliveries. These potential complications make accurate diagnosis crucial. In a series of pregnant patients with renal colic, 28% of patients with abdominal pain had an incorrect admitting diagnosis based on clinical evaluation. These diagnoses included appendicitis, diverticulitis, and placental abruption.

Ultrasound (US) is widely used as the first-line diagnostic test in pregnant women with abdominal pain because of its availability, low cost, and lack of ionizing radiation. An increasing number of studies have shown that MRI is valuable in evaluating specific causes of abdominal and pelvic pain in pregnancy and is the preferred investigation when ultrasound is inconclusive, owing to the lack of ionizing radiation. Magnetic resonance urography (MRU) without contrast should be considered as a second-line test during pregnancy when the use of US fails to establish a diagnosis.

### Alternative diagnoses to stone disease on unenhanced CT to investigate acute flank pain [^1152jgsx]. Emergency Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

Acute flank pain is a common problem in emergency medicine. The most frequent cause is urolithiasis, but many other entities can cause the same clinical presentation. In many institutions, unenhanced computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen is used in this setting. One of the major advantages of unenhanced CT is its ability to detect other pathologies causing flank pain. In this pictorial review, we present the CT findings of pathologies other than stone disease in patients with acute flank pain.

### A rare case of Page kidney in a young man with flank pain [^116V2XXA]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Page kidney is a rare condition in which an external compression of the kidney due to a hematoma or mass leads to renal ischemia and hypertension. In patients with flank pain, elevated blood pressure, and recent trauma, this condition should be considered. Since it was first described in 1939, more than 100 case reports have emerged.

- **Case report**: We describe the case of a 26-year-old man who presented to the Emergency Department with flank pain, vomiting, and elevated blood pressure. A computed tomography scan of the abdomen and pelvis confirmed the presence of a perinephric hematoma, and the interventional radiology team was consulted to resolve the Page kidney.

- **Importance for emergency physicians**: Symptoms of Page kidney may resemble those of more common conditions encountered in the emergency department. It is crucial to maintain high suspicion and order imaging studies as needed, particularly following trauma or recent procedures near the renal parenchyma.

### Imaging patients with renal colic — consider ultrasound first [^115UkMsG]. Insights into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of renal colic is usually based on clinical grounds, and immediate imaging is not always necessary. However, it is now common practice to perform imaging studies in all patients with suspected renal colic admitted to the Emergency Department. This may be due to the fear of missing a life-threatening condition mimicking this condition, such as rupture of an aortic aneurysm, ovarian torsion, or appendicitis, or the need for imaging confirmation of the cause of symptoms before deciding whether a patient may be discharged. Currently, additional strong indications for imaging include the desire of patients to know the cause of their symptoms and the fear of litigation. If not in all patients, immediate imaging modalities are necessary in those without clinical improvement after treatment, in cases with fever or leukocytosis, or in special circumstances (i.e. patients with a single kidney and/or renal failure). Furthermore, imaging is recommended in patients with remission of symptoms who do not eliminate the stone within a few days.

### Spleen injury following left extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL) [^113Zw6SU]. BMC Urology (2015). Low credibility.

A 54-year-old anxious male presented to the emergency room after experiencing 12 hours of severe, medically recalcitrant left flank pain. A CT scan and KUB showed a 15 mm by 8 mm left mid-polar renal calculus. The patient underwent left ESWL under regional anesthesia, which was performed with 1–7 KV power, at 120 shocks per minute for a total of 2500 shocks. Although the patient's pain was controlled, he remained very nervous and had to be repositioned eight individual times. Approximately six hours after the ESWL, the patient contacted the urologist, complaining of severe left flank pain unlike any previous episode of renal colic. An emergency room evaluation noted a hypotensive patient with left upper and lower quadrant pain and peritoneal signs.

A CT scan demonstrated a stage 3 splenic injury with hemoperitoneum while the left kidney did not show extravasation or parenchymal injury but did have a fractured calculus, illustrating that the stone was effectively treated. A general surgery consultation was obtained, and an emergent splenectomy was performed. The surgeon drained 2.0 liters of hemoperitoneum while transfusing the patient with six units of packed red blood cells. The patient experienced an uneventful recovery.

### Incidental diagnosis of diseases on un-enhanced helical computed tomography performed for ureteric colic [^117EU1mi]. BMC Urology (2003). Low credibility.

Patients presenting in the emergency room with flank pain suggestive of acute ureteric colic may have alternative underlying conditions mimicking ureteric stones. An early diagnosis and appropriate treatment for other causes of flank pain is important. The majority of centers around the world are increasingly using un-enhanced helical CT (UHCT) for the evaluation of ureteric colic. This study was conducted to determine the incidence and spectrum of significant incidental diagnoses established or suggested on UHCT performed for suspected renal/ureteric colic.

- **Methods**: Urologists and radiologists reviewed 233 consecutive UHCT scans performed for suspected renal/ureteral colic along with an assessment of the medical records. Radiological diagnoses of clinical entities not suspected otherwise were analyzed. All other relevant radiological, biochemical, and serological investigations and per-operative findings were also noted.

- **Results**: Ureteral calculi were identified in 148 examinations (64%), findings of recent passage of calculi in 10 (4%), and no calculus in 75 examinations (32%). Overall, incidental findings (additional or alternative diagnosis) were found in 28 (12%) CT scans. Twenty (71%) of these diagnoses were confirmed by per-operative findings, biopsy, and other radiological and biochemical investigations or on clinical follow-up.

- **Conclusion**: A wide spectrum of significant incidental diagnoses can be identified on UHCT performed for suspected renal/ureteral colic. In the present series of 233 consecutive CT examinations, the incidence of incidental diagnosis was 12%.

### Does computed tomographic scan affect diagnosis and management of patients with suspected renal colic [^115LziJq]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Patients with renal colic commonly present to the emergency department (ED) and are usually treated with analgesics, antiemetics, and hydration. Computed tomographic (CT) scan is commonly utilized in evaluating patients with suspected renal colic.

- **Objectives**: We compared diagnosis and treatment plans before and after CT in patients with suspected renal colic to evaluate how often changes in diagnosis, treatment, and disposition are made.

- **Methods**: In this prospective observational study, we enrolled a convenience sample of clinically stable ED patients older than 17 with suspected renal colic for whom CT was planned. Exclusion criteria were chronic kidney disease, urinary tract infection, recent CT, and history of previous kidney stones. Pre-CT and post-CT surveys were completed by the treating provider.

- **Results**: The discharge diagnosis was renal colic in 62 of 93 enrolled patients (67%). Urinalysis showed blood in 52 of these patients (84%). CT confirmed obstructing kidney or bladder stones in 50 patients. There were five cases of alternative diagnoses noted on CT scans. After the CT scan, 7 patients had changes in disposition. Sixteen providers felt that CT would not change management; in these cases, CT offered no alternative diagnosis and didn't change disposition.

- **Conclusion**: CT scan didn't change management when providers did not expect it would. This indicates that providers who are confident in the diagnosis of renal colic should consider forgoing a CT scan. CT scans occasionally found important alternative diagnoses and should be utilized when necessary.

### Does baseline radiography of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder help facilitate stone management in patients presenting to the emergency department with renal colic [^11636BgB]. Journal of Endourology (2013). Low credibility.

A baseline kidneys, ureters, and bladder (KUB) radiograph, at the time of computed tomography (CT) for ureteral stones, might aid interpretation of future KUBs. The CT scout radiograph might render the baseline KUB redundant, however. We sought to assess the diagnostic utility of baseline KUB for patients with ureteral stones.

- **Patients and methods**: Patients with ureteral stones were retrospectively identified. All had a baseline KUB in addition to CT and were reassessed after 4 to 60 days with KUB. Each patient's imaging was randomized 1:1 into either "KUB&CT" or "CT" groups. Three urologists independently assessed the imaging: CT (with scout film) and baseline KUB in the KUB&CT group, but only the CT (not KUB) in the CT group. Definitive stone assessment on follow-up KUB was defined as all three reviewers answering either Yes or No (not Indeterminate) to the question of stone passage or migration.

- **Results**: Of 154 stones, the mean diameter was 4.8 ± 2.1 mm, density was 914 ± 300 Hounsfield units (HU), with 54.4% in the distal ureter. Stone visibility was 60.4% on KUB vs. 43.5% on scout film (P < 0.001). Scout film visibility favored the CT group (52.7% vs. 35.0%, P = 0.027). After adjusting for body mass index, skin-to-stone distance, size, density, and location, definitive assessment rates were higher in the KUB&CT group (P = 0.047). When reviewers reassessed the CT group using the baseline KUB, they were able to do so definitively in an additional 16 (21.6%, P < 0.001). Definitive assessments were associated with higher rates of stone visibility on scout film.

### Prevalence and clinical importance of alternative causes of symptoms using a renal colic computed tomography protocol in patients with flank or back pain and absence of pyuria [^1153kQMC]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The study was undertaken to determine the prevalence and clinical importance of alternative causes of symptoms discovered in patients undergoing flank pain protocol (FPP) computed tomography (CT) scans who exhibit classic symptoms of kidney stones (flank pain, back pain, or both) without evidence of urine infection.

This was a retrospective observational analysis of all adult patients undergoing FPP CT scans at two emergency departments (EDs) between April 2005 and November 2010. All CTs (N = 5,383) were reviewed and categorized into three groups: "no cause of symptoms seen on CT", "ureteral stone as cause of symptoms", or "non-kidney stone cause of symptoms". Non-kidney stone scans were further categorized as "acutely important", "follow-up recommended", or "unimportant cause", based on a priori diagnostic classifications. To assess demographics and validate symptoms, all nonstone causes of pain and a random subset of subjects (n = 1,843; 34%) underwent a full record review blinded to CT categorization to determine whether flank and/or back pain was present and if there was objective evidence of pyuria.

Of all FPP CT scans during the study period, a ureteral stone was found to cause symptoms in 47.7% of CTs, whereas no cause of symptoms was found in 43.3% of CTs. A non-kidney stone diagnosis was found in 9.0% of all CTs, with 6.1% categorized as "acutely important", 2.2% as "follow-up recommended", and 0.65% with symptoms attributed to an "unimportant cause". In the randomly selected subset undergoing full record review, categorizations were similar, with 49.0% of CTs showing kidney stones as the cause.

### Imaging patients with renal colic-consider ultrasound first [^116GoTVw]. Insights into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

The possibility of obtaining a diagnosis using ultrasound (US) in patients with suspected renal colic has several advantages, including its widespread availability and reduced cost compared to the use of computed tomography (CT). Most importantly, the use of an algorithm in which US is employed first can avoid radiation exposure in about 70% of cases. Furthermore, as underlined by Catalano et al. and Ripolles et al, it seems safe to use this diagnostic technique even though it is known to have a lower sensitivity than CT in this field. In fact, in both studies, spontaneous passage of the stone within a few days after the acute episode was observed in all patients with a false-negative US examination.

In addition, a recent multicentre study clearly described the primary role of US in the investigation of renal colic today, demonstrating that the initial use of US is not associated with more complications, serious adverse events, or hospitalisations than the initial evaluation with CT. It must also be remembered that in patients whose symptoms are not due to renal colic, US has the ability to identify alternative diagnoses, albeit with a slightly lower sensitivity than CT. Most important, life-threatening situations that may mimic renal colic can be recognised with US.

Nonetheless, US also has a few disadvantages: it may take longer to perform than non-enhanced CT and must be conducted by an experienced examiner. The first of these limitations cannot be justified within the framework of the justification process of diagnostic studies using ionising radiation; radiologists are strongly advised…

### Squamous cell carcinoma within a horseshoe kidney with associated renal stones detected by computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging [^115nwnXm]. Urology (2011). Low credibility.

We describe a 69-year-old man who came to our observation with a history of persistent left flank abdominal pain, fever for several weeks, and a previous history of passing renal stones. Radiological examinations with computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed a solid mass within the left side of a horseshoe kidney, with associated large renal stones. The patient subsequently underwent partial left nephrectomy. The final diagnosis was consistent with squamous cell carcinoma arising in a horseshoe kidney with associated renal stones.

### Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis in a male child with renal vein thrombus extending into the inferior vena cava: A case report [^111vFB7o]. BMC Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

An 11-year-old male child presented with a history of high-grade fever with chills, right flank pain, and progressive pyuria for two months. He had a prior history of surgery for vesical calculus and anterior urethral calculus, for which he underwent open cystolithotomy and urethrolithotomy four years ago. The chemical nature of the stone was calcium oxalate dihydrate. A medical work-up did not reveal any cause for the calculus.

On examination, the child was emaciated and febrile with pallor. There was diffuse tenderness in the right lumbar region with renal angle tenderness. An X-ray showed a radio-opaque shadow in the right lumbar region, measuring 2 × 2 cm. Abdominal computerised tomography (CT) revealed a dilated pelvicalyceal system with necrotic debris at the lower pole of the right kidney and a thrombus in the renal vein extending into the infrahepatic vena cava. Pyonephrosis, parenchymal calcification, along with marked retroperitoneal and porta hepatis lymphadenopathy, were also seen on the CT. Blood urea and serum creatinine were within normal limits. Gram-negative bacilli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, were isolated from thick pus aspirated from the right renal pelvis. The urine culture was sterile.

Open nephrostomy was done, which drained only pus and no urinary drainage. Following a renal biopsy diagnosed as chronic pyelonephritis with end-stage changes, the patient underwent subcapsular right nephrectomy. Kidney exposure was accomplished through the flank extraperitoneally using a 12th rib cutting incision. There were dense adhesions of the kidney and Gerota's fascia.

### Lithostat [^115iJD1z]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Lithostat® may induce adverse reactions that have not yet been recognized. Unusual symptoms should be reported to your physician. Mild symptoms usually do not warrant discontinuation of treatment, but severe symptoms may necessitate temporary cessation of treatment and/or alteration of dosage.

- **Taking other drugs with Lithostat®**: Only take drugs prescribed by your physician. Do not take prescription or over-the-counter preparations without your physician's specific prescription or recommendation. Drugs that contain iron should not be taken at the same time as Lithostat® (acetohydroxamic acid) because Lithostat® reacts with iron, which may prevent it from being absorbed into the bloodstream. Both the iron you take and the Lithostat® may be ineffective if taken together.

- **Importance of daily dosage**: It is essential to follow your daily dosage schedule with Lithostat® to maintain treatment effectiveness; failure to comply may lead to setbacks in treatment and new kidney stone formation. Lithostat® plus antibiotic therapy must be taken exactly as prescribed by your physician for optimum effectiveness. Be sure to report any unusual side effects to your physician immediately.

### Flank pain as a symptom of COVID-19 [^116W5N2S]. Urology (2021). Low credibility.

The COVID-19 disease is spreading rapidly worldwide, and no vaccine or very effective drug has been found yet. However, the transmission rate of the disease can be reduced by taking precautions. Therefore, it is essential to detect patients early to prevent the spread of the disease. We report a case of a 26-year-old male patient who was admitted to our urology outpatient clinic with the complaint of flank pain and had incidental findings of COVID-19 in the lung bases on abdominal CT.

### Renal vein thrombosis mimicking urinary calculus: A dilemma of diagnosis [^113rpeNw]. BMC Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Renal vein thrombosis (RVT) with flank pain and hematuria is often mistaken for renal colic originating from ureteric or renal calculus. Especially in young and otherwise healthy patients, clinicians can be easily misled by clinical presentations and calcified RVT.

- **Case presentation**: A 38-year-old woman presented with flank pain and hematuria, suggestive of renal calculus on ultrasound. She underwent extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, which failed, leading to the recommendation for percutaneous lithotomy to remove the renal calculus. In the preoperative view of the unusual shape of the calculus without hydronephrosis, noncontrast computed tomography was taken and demonstrated left ureteric calculus. However, computed tomography angiography revealed, surprisingly, a calcified RVT that was initially thought to be a urinary calculus.

- **Conclusion**: This case shows that a calcified RVT might mimic a urinary calculus on conventional ultrasonography and ureteric calculus on noncontrast computed tomography. Subsequent computed tomography angiography disclosed that a calcified RVT caused the imaging findings, thus creating a potentially dangerous clinical pitfall. Hence, it is suggested that the possibility of an RVT needs to be considered in the differential diagnosis whenever an uncommon shape for a urinary calculus is detected.

### Ureterocele as a cause of chronic intractable abdominal pain [^1159BNr1]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

A ureterocele is a submucosal, cystic dilation of the terminal ureter, either congenital or acquired, as it enters the bladder. It is a rare clinical entity that can be entirely asymptomatic and present as an incidental finding, or it can manifest with distressing symptoms such as unremitting abdominal pain, haematuria, and obstructive uropathy.

A case is presented of abdominal pain in a 43-year-old woman, initially attributed to various clinical conditions, who was eventually referred to a chronic pain clinic. The patient underwent numerous diagnostic tests, psychological evaluations, and therapeutic interventions, including surgeries, over the years. These interventions failed to mitigate her symptoms until urologic imaging reported an intravesical ureterocele as the underlying disorder. The case report details the diagnostic challenges faced by the authors, along with the clinical characteristics of ureterocele.

### Left flank pain as the sole manifestation of acute pancreatitis: A report of a case with an initial misdiagnosis [^116RsY8r]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Acute pancreatitis is not uncommon in an emergency department (ED). It typically manifests as upper abdominal pain, sometimes with radiation to the back and flank region. However, isolated left flank pain as the sole manifestation of acute pancreatitis is very rare and has not been previously identified in the literature. In this report, we present a case of acute pancreatitis presenting solely with left flank pain. Initially, the patient was misdiagnosed with potential "acute pyelonephritis or other renal diseases" due to negative ultrasound findings. A second radiographic evaluation using computed tomography revealed pancreatitis in the tail, with abnormal fluid collection extending to the left perirenal space. We performed a literature review and discussed this rare occurrence of acute pancreatitis. Additionally, we explored the clinical pitfalls encountered in this case.

### Diagnosis and management of fibromuscular dysplasia and segmental arterial mediolysis in gastroenterology field: A mini-review [^1133CdqN]. World Journal of Gastroenterology (2018). High credibility.

The disease fibromuscular dysplasia can be associated with various clinical features: abdominal bruit, epigastric or flank bruit, and abdominal pain worsening after eating. Other possible symptoms include intracranial aneurysm, claudication, tinnitus, cervical bruit, weight loss, sweating, stroke, cold fingers or toes, and dizziness.

Additional signs are the "string of beads" sign, digital ischemia, carotid-cavernous fistula, weakness, facial weakness, vertebral arteriovenous fistula, and pulse differences between arms. Patients may also experience headaches, renal artery dissection, early-onset hypertension, arterial aneurysm, renal artery aneurysm, arterial dissection, and renal atrophy. Further complications can involve visceral artery aneurysm, hypertension, dyspnea, CKD (chronic kidney disease), and difficulty speaking.

Associated syndromes include Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, which may present with symptoms such as femoral bruit, cold limbs, chest pain, migraine, numbness, and weakness in the legs. Risk factors like cigarette smoking can contribute to acute coronary syndrome, neck pain, TIA (transient ischemic attack), mesenteric ischemia, nausea, arterial tortuosity, cervical artery dissection, and temporary loss of vision.

### Acute flank pain: a modern approach to diagnosis and management [^114Hh4Ji]. Seminars in Ultrasound, CT, and MR (1999). High credibility.

Among various potential causes, flank pain can result from multiple medical conditions, including:

- **Gastrointestinal and abdominal conditions**: Acute diverticulitis, acute appendicitis, bowel obstruction, gastroenteritis, acute pancreatitis, acute mesenteric ischemia, ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm, liver abscess, acute hepatitis.

- **Genitourinary conditions**: Testicular torsion, adnexal torsion, ectopic pregnancy, renal vein thrombosis, renal artery thrombosis, renal cell carcinoma, nephrolithiasis, acute pyelonephritis, ureteral obstruction, polycystic kidney disease, interstitial nephritis, glomerulonephritis.

### Does this patient have pheochromocytoma? A systematic review of clinical signs and symptoms [^116468ZP]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

After selecting articles for analysis and considering the inclusion and exclusion criteria, we extracted the crude numbers of patients exhibiting symptoms or signs of possible pheochromocytoma. The symptoms include:

- **Classic triad components**: Headache, palpitation, diaphoresis (three parts of the classic triad), total classic triad
- **General symptoms**: Flushing, pallor, nausea/vomiting, weakness/fatigue
- **Gastrointestinal symptoms**: Diarrhea, constipation
- **Other symptoms**: Dizziness/vertigo, chest pain, abdominal pain, flank pain, dyspnea, paresthesias, anxiety, visual symptoms, tremor

The signs we looked for were hypertension and orthostatic hypotension.

We filled 2 × 2 tables for calculating the likelihood ratio (LR) for the symptoms that we could, and compiled the sensitivities in a separate table. A meta-analysis was conducted when possible (number of studies more than one) for LR of symptoms and signs, and separately for sensitivities. Several factors affect the distribution of symptoms and signs in studies, such as the distribution of genders, presence of malignant or benign disease, and size of the tumor. However, none of the studies had separated these factors, preventing subgroup analysis or meta-regression in the presence of heterogeneous data.

Heterogeneity was calculated by drawing a Forest plot and conducting an I² test. Heterogeneity was considered as I² > 50%. As our data was heterogeneous based on I² (except for one instance), a random effects model was used for the meta-analysis. We checked for publication bias by drawing a Funnel plot for each sign/symptom and conducting an Egger test. If the P value in the Egger test was below 0.05, the data was considered to have publication bias.

### Role of imaging in visceral vascular emergencies [^113Ju8hd]. Insights into Imaging (2020). Low credibility.

A 56-year-old male with no past medical history presented to the Emergency Department with right flank pain. A preliminary ultrasound study showed a large cystic mass within the right renal hilum.

- **Findings**:
	- An axial arterial phase CT image revealed a large renal artery aneurysm, with no evidence of rupture. A reformatted volume-rendered image from the same study clearly demonstrated the aneurysm arising from the distal portion of the right renal artery. The patient was subsequently treated with elective surgery.

Renal artery pseudoaneurysms (RAPs) arise from arterial injuries and subsequent loss of vessel wall integrity. Surgical and percutaneous procedures, penetrating trauma, and infectious causes are among the common underlying causes of RAP formation. The sac is contained by the media or adventitia of the vessel or by the perivascular tissues. Through the neck of this perfused sac, the pseudoaneurysm is in direct communication with the arterial lumen. Vasculitis may also cause several pseudoaneurysms within the renal parenchyma. In contrast to the rare occurrence of spontaneous rupture in renal artery aneurysms, RAPs may spontaneously rupture more frequently. CT angiography is the preferred modality for diagnosis, with contrast filling in the saccular structure being a common finding in RAP. Endovascular treatment is the preferred approach for treating renal pseudoaneurysms, but surgical intervention may also be indicated in certain patients.

A 36-year-old female underwent partial nephrectomy for low-grade renal cell carcinoma and presented to the Emergency Department.

### Imaging patients with renal colic-consider ultrasound first [^113vBvRb]. Insights into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Rethinking the imaging strategies in patients with suspected renal colic, taking into account radiation protection considerations, is possible and has started both within the radiological community and among emergency physicians. Urologists also agree on this topic: in the 2014 guidelines on urolithiasis of the European Association of Urology, it is stated that in patients with renal stone disease, ultrasound (US) should be used as the primary procedure. Computed tomography (CT) should be reserved for those patients who do not improve with conservative treatment or when there is a suspicion of a non-urologic process.

### Multimodality imaging of renal lymphoma and its mimics [^115TV4RF]. Insights into Imaging (2022). Low credibility.

Clinically, patients with renal lymphoma are relatively asymptomatic; however, they can present with flank pain, hematuria, night sweats, and fever. Acute renal failure rarely manifests as the initial finding in cases of diffuse involvement. While renal lymphoma can respond to treatment similar to lymphoma elsewhere in the body, it carries a poorer prognosis. Furthermore, patients presenting with acute renal failure due to lymphocytic infiltration of the renal parenchyma may see improvement in renal function with the treatment of the underlying lymphoma, but typically not back to baseline.

- **Role of multimodality imaging**: CT is the imaging modality of choice for the initial evaluation of patients with suspected lymphoma. The advantages of CT include high sensitivity for the detection of renal lesions, extrarenal tumor extension, and involvement of other organs. Intravenous contrast is essential for detecting subtle lesions; imaging in the late arterial phase helps evaluate the vasculature and differentiate lymphoma from hypervascular primary renal tumors. The nephrographic phase is crucial in detecting small lesions. Lymphomatous deposits tend to enhance less than the renal cortex and appear homogeneous. MRI is useful in demonstrating renal and perirenal disease; however, its role in evaluating renal lymphoma is less clearly defined in the literature. Renal lymphomatous tumors appear as T1 hypointense and T2 iso- or hypointense relative to the renal cortex. On post-contrast MRI, renal lymphoma enhances less.

### Pulmonary embolism presenting as flank pain: a case series [^115TV4Jx]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a potentially fatal disease that can be effectively treated once diagnosed. Due to its insidious and often cryptogenic presentations, the diagnosis of this disease can easily elude clinicians. Over the last several years, the use of computed tomography (CT) scanning has improved the clinician's ability to diagnose PE. Furthermore, the widespread use of CT to investigate other complaints, such as flank and abdominal pain, could theoretically result in radiographic findings not previously identified that could point to the diagnosis of PE. The case series reveals the unexpected and initially unrecognized CT finding of a pulmonary infarct in two patients presenting with flank pain; a third patient presented with flank pain and was also found to have a PE.

- **Objective**: We describe three cases of patients who presented to the emergency department with flank pain and were diagnosed with pulmonary embolism.

- **Case reports**: The cases reported here discuss patients who presented with flank pain and were ultimately diagnosed with PE. In the first two cases, the patients had incidental findings of pulmonary infiltrates on abdominal CT scans, which prompted further diagnostic investigation. In the third case, the patient had risk factors for PE, presented with flank pain, and the diagnosis was quickly made by CT imaging.

- **Conclusion**: Physicians should consider pulmonary embolism in the differential diagnosis of patients with isolated flank pain. Additionally, unexpected pulmonary findings on abdominal CT scans may help suggest the diagnosis of PE.

### Inflammation and kidney stones: Cause and effect [^1136nquY]. Current Opinion in Urology (2023). Low credibility.

The purpose of this short review is to highlight the potential role of inflammation as a key pathological driver, rather than a mere consequence, of nephrolithiasis. There is a strong likelihood that the relationship is bidirectional and that kidney stone-triggered inflammation can establish a vicious cycle of tissue injury and stone formation.

Recent findings consist of data from both preclinical and clinical studies demonstrating the importance of inflammation in models of stone disease and in kidney tissue from patients with nephrolithiasis. Inflammation is identified as a potential driver of disease recurrence and a suitable treatment target. In particular, the role of immune cells and their relationship to the NLRP3 inflammasome is becoming clearer, as is the potential contribution of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1β and interleukin-18 to tissue injury and stone formation.

The concept of inflammation as a treatment target is not new and raises the possibility that targeting inflammation directly may prove to be a novel and suitable means of treatment for at least some types of kidney stones. This may be applicable in certain clinical settings, both acutely and as prevention, especially in patients experiencing recurrent stone episodes or who have a well-defined metabolic cause such as uric acid or calcium oxalate stones.

### Unilateral global renal infarction in a patient with ischemic stroke and hypertensive heart disease in a resource limited setting: a case report [^116jRP38]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Low credibility.

Patients with acute renal infarctions usually present with sudden abdominal or flank pain, nausea, vomiting, hematuria, and sometimes fever. Skin color changes are seen in about one-third of cases. The condition can mimic other disorders, leading to delayed diagnosis. Some patients may be asymptomatic, contributing to underdiagnosis, and may be discovered incidentally during imaging for other reasons, as in this case where the patient was sent to have a contrast-enhanced chest CT scan to rule out acute pulmonary thromboembolism.

Renal thromboembolism should always be considered in the differential diagnosis for patients presenting with acute flank or abdominal pain, particularly when accompanied by elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and/or hematuria. Laboratory findings typically reveal elevated LDH levels in nearly all cases, making this a key diagnostic indicator. Urinalysis often demonstrates hematuria (though not universally), while proteinuria is observed in approximately 45% of patients. Although serum creatinine levels usually show a slight increase without being significantly elevated initially, this case was different. It was marked by a sudden rapid increase in both creatinine and LDH levels, coinciding with the detection of complete renal infarction in previously normal lab results, highlighting the rarity of this occurrence. Imaging plays a crucial role in accurately diagnosing renal infarction, with angiography yielding positive results in all cases and renal isotope exams showing abnormalities in 97% of cases. CT scans are diagnostic in 80% of cases, while ultraso

### Urolithiasis in the emergency department [^116hCtoc]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Urolithiasis commonly presents to the emergency department with acute, severe, unilateral flank pain. Patients with a suspected first-time stone or atypical presentation should be evaluated with a noncontrast computed tomography scan to confirm the diagnosis and rule out alternative diagnoses. Narcotics remain the mainstay of pain management; however, in select patients, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories alone or in combination with narcotics provide safe and effective analgesia in the emergency department. Most kidney stones can be managed with pain control and expectant management, but obstructing kidney stones with a suspected proximal urinary tract infection are urological emergencies requiring emergent decompression, antibiotics, and resuscitation.

Renal stone disease is common in Europe, with a prevalence ranging between 2% and 8%. It is a condition affecting relatively young individuals with an almost equal sex ratio and a high tendency to recur. It is estimated that almost 50% of stone patients will experience recurrence within 10 years. Renal colics result from ureteral obstruction by the stones, which are a common cause of visits to the Emergency Department and frequently require imaging evaluation.

In most institutions, non-enhanced multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) is considered the gold standard technique for evaluating these patients because of its accuracy in detecting stones as well as other pathological conditions that mimic renal colic. It is also regarded as the first imaging technique for evaluating patients with the acute onset of flank pain by The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria. MDCT allows for an overall assessment of the "stone load", which can help in planning treatment. However, the vast majority of stones pass spontaneously, and CT imaging in the emergency department rarely alters immediate management.

Concerns about the overutilization of CT are growing due to increasing healthcare costs and, more importantly, exposure to ionizing radiation. The use of low-dose techniques can dramatically reduce the radiation dose, but these low-dose protocols have not been adopted worldwide.

On the other hand, ultrasound (US) is a safe, non-invasive, and inexpensive technique able to evaluate patients with renal colic. However, its use remains limited in some regions.

### Kidney stones: Pathophysiology and medical management [^114YWGjd]. Lancet (2006). Low credibility.

The formation of stones in the urinary tract stems from a wide range of underlying disorders. It is imperative that clinicians look for the underlying causes of nephrolithiasis to direct management. There are many advances in genetics, pathophysiology, diagnostic imaging, medical treatment, medical prevention, and surgical intervention of nephrolithiasis. This text provides a brief general background and focuses mainly on the pathophysiology and medical treatment of kidney stones. Although important advances have been made in understanding nephrolithiasis from single-gene defects, the understanding of polygenetic causes of kidney stones is still largely elusive. A substantial proportion of data that resulted in new methods of treatment and prevention, which can be empirical or definitive, has focused on the urinary luminal chemical composition of the precipitating solutes. Manipulation of inhibitors and epithelial factors is important and needs further investigation. Advances in the management of nephrolithiasis depend on the combined efforts of clinicians and scientists to understand the pathophysiology.

### Probenecid and colchicine [^114Rw2f8]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2016). Low credibility.

Hematuria, renal colic, costovertebral pain, and the formation of uric acid stones associated with the use of probenecid and colchicine in gouty patients may be prevented by the alkalization of the urine and a liberal fluid intake (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). In these cases, when alkali is administered, the acid-base balance of the patient should be monitored.

Use with caution in patients with a history of peptic ulcer. Probenecid and colchicine have been used in patients with some renal impairment, but dosage requirements may be increased. Probenecid and colchicine may not be effective in chronic renal insufficiency, particularly when the glomerular filtration rate is 30 mL/minute or less.

A reducing substance may appear in the urine of patients receiving probenecid. This disappears with the discontinuance of therapy. Suspected glycosuria should be confirmed by using a test specific for glucose.

Adequate animal studies have not been conducted to determine the carcinogenicity potential of probenecid or this drug combination. Since colchicine is an established mutagen, its ability to act as a carcinogen must be suspected, and the administration of probenecid and colchicine should involve a weighing of the benefits versus risks when long-term administration is contemplated.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® acute onset flank pain-suspicion of stone disease (urolithiasis) [^113KcCn9]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2023). High credibility.

With regard to diagnostic investigations for nephrolithiasis, and more specifically concerning diagnostic imaging, the ACR 2023 guidelines recommend obtaining an unenhanced CT as the follow-up imaging for patients presenting with acute-onset flank pain and a known history of stone disease based on recent imaging. Additionally, consider obtaining a color Doppler ultrasound or a contrast-enhanced CT in these patients.

### Renal colic: New concepts related to pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment [^111mzkNr]. Current Opinion in Urology (2002). Low credibility.

To provide new insights into the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of acute renal colic caused by a stone disease.

- **Recent findings**: Traditional intravenous pyelography is no longer the primary method of investigation in patients with renal colic. If the patient has a history of previous attacks of renal colic and stone disease, the recommended diagnostic approach is to start with plain abdominal radiography and ultrasonography, alongside Doppler ultrasonography. Noncontrast computerized tomography is reserved for unsolved problems. For patients with no history of stone disease or atypical clinical presentations, it is better to start with noncontrast computerized tomography. Intravenous pyelography remains indispensable if an endoscopic or open intervention is required. Magnetic resonance imaging is a promising method of investigation, particularly in pregnant women. Effective pain relief is achieved through the use of opioids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or desmopressin.

- **Summary**: The diagnostic approach to renal colic has recently changed due to the introduction of new, noninvasive radiologic procedures such as Doppler ultrasonography, noncontrast computerized tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging.

### A case of flank pain caused by ureteral intussusception accompanied with ureteral polyp [^112H3x6V]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Low credibility.

Iatrogenic causes of ureteral intussusception can include:

- **Iatrogenic 1**: Secondary to ureteroscopy.
- **Iatrogenic 2**: Secondary to double CH endoprosthesis.
- **Iatrogenic 3**: Secondary to percutaneous nephrostomy catheter exchange (retrograde intussusception).
- **Iatrogenic 4**: Secondary to percutaneous endopyelotomy for UPJ obstruction.

Ureteral intussusception does not occur spontaneously, largely because of the small ratio between ureteral wall thickness and lumen caliber and the limited range of mobility of the ureter itself, which prevents ureter invagination. However, when a slow-growing object, typically a benign tumor, occupies the ureter, it draws down the proximal ureter, enters the distal dilated ureter by peristaltic activity, urine flow, and gravitational force, and sporadically leads to ureteral intussusception.

A review of previously reported cases revealed that intussusception is usually antegrade and more prevalent in men on the right side. The common manifestations in patients include a history of intermittent hematuria and repeated flank pain, but malignant tumor-related ureteral intussusception is often asymptomatic and occurs uniformly in patients aged ≥ 50 years. Some scholars proposed the potential risk of ureteral ischemia because of the possible deficiency of the blood supply to the intussusceptum. However, no evidence of regional ureteral ischemic necrosis associated with ureteral intussusception has been reported previously, which is compatible with the characteristic sluggish changes underlying intussusception.

### Unenhanced helical CT in the investigation of acute flank pain [^116tBF7J]. Clinical Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

Unenhanced helical CT has emerged as the imaging technique of choice for investigating patients presenting with acute flank pain and suspected nephroureteric stone disease. There are several signs identifiable on unenhanced CT that support a diagnosis of stone disease. However, there are many pitfalls that may confound a correct diagnosis. Some of the common pitfalls, together with methods to avoid such occurrences, will be discussed. A review of some of the common alternative diagnoses that may mimic the symptoms of nephroureteric stone disease is illustrated.

### Arteriovenous malformation mimicking a renal-cell carcinoma [^115n8kBA]. Journal of Endourology (2002). Low credibility.

We describe a renal arteriovenous malformation in a patient with a 1-month history of flank pain. Imaging studies were interpreted as being consistent with renal-cell carcinoma. However, Doppler ultrasonography demonstrated turbulent blood flow, and selective renal angiography confirmed the diagnosis of an arteriovenous malformation. Embolization relieved the pain. This case calls attention to the need to consider arteriovenous malformations in the differential diagnosis of centrally, homogeneously enhancing renal lesions.

### Pyelocalyceal diverticulum: An unusual cause of acute renal colic [^116rUHPE]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

The differential diagnosis of acute flank pain includes kidney stones, urinary tract infection, dissecting abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), arterial or venous compromise of the kidney, renal abscess, renal carcinoma, and papillary necrosis. This is a report of an unusual cause of renal colic: pyelocalyceal diverticulum. Stasis of urine within a diverticulum promotes both calculus formation and urinary tract infection, either of which can lead to colic. Several radiographic findings may suggest a calyceal diverticulum, including, on plain X-ray, a very peripheral or mobile renal calculus, or on intravenous pyelogram, an early filling-defect and delayed or retained filling of a circular or ovoid mass.

### Imaging of flank pain: Readdressing state-of-the-art [^1167C6W1]. Emergency Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Pain resulting from renal and ureteral stones is a common cause for patients presenting in the acute setting. Since the late 1990s, computed tomography (CT) has been the initial imaging method of choice to evaluate patients with suspected ureteral stones; however, concerns regarding both radiation dose and cost-effectiveness have prompted investigations into a different imaging algorithm. Studies utilizing ultrasound have provided evidence indicating that it may be a more appropriate first step, with selective use of CT in selected cases, in the diagnostic work-up. Techniques have evolved with low-dose CT, dual-energy CT, and magnetic resonance urography emerging as useful in imaging of renal colic patients. This manuscript reviews the literature on state-of-the-art imaging for acute flank pain and proposes a new imaging algorithm in the evaluation of patients with acute flank pain and suspected ureteral stones.

### Prevalence of microhematuria in renal colic and urolithiasis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1151qP1t]. BMC Urology (2020). Low credibility.

Renal colic is caused by the presence of stones in the urinary tract and is characterized by the sudden onset of severe loin pain, radiating to the flank, groin, and testes or labia majora. The incidence amounts to 240 per 100,000 persons with a prevalence of up to 10%; men are more commonly affected than women, with a ratio of 3–2:1. The lifetime risk is up to 19% in men and 9% in women, varying depending on geographic location and increasing constantly over the last few years.

Guidelines for the diagnostic pathway suggest assessing (micro) hematuria, while the gold standard of imaging is unenhanced multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT). As a diagnostic tool, the STONE Score was developed and validated; this score includes parameters such as sex, duration of pain prior to presentation, race, nausea, vomiting, and microhematuria. Microhematuria prevalence in suspected renal colic has been studied in several trials, ranging from 55% to 93%.

In order to better understand the differences existing in prevalence range, we performed a meta-analysis of studies dealing with microhematuria by suspected acute renal colic and/or confirmed urolithiasis.

### Sudden onset flank pain: Spontaneous renal rupture [^115H9J8J]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Undifferentiated abdominal pain is a common condition encountered in the emergency department. While a patient's age, risk factors, and comorbidities often aid in risk stratification and guide emergency department evaluation, atypical presentations of serious disease may still occur suddenly in young, otherwise healthy patients.

- **Case report**: In this vignette, we discuss a case of spontaneous, atraumatic renal rupture with large retroperitoneal hemorrhage (Wunderlich's Syndrome) in a 22-year-old male.

- **Discussion**: Emergency physicians regularly encounter uncommon causes of abdominal pain. Wunderlich's syndrome is rare, but a proper understanding of the disease process will aid in decision-making and improve disposition and outcomes for patients. Likely presentations and risk factors for atraumatic renal rupture will be discussed, as well as ED management and definitive treatment options.

### Letter to the editor: Spontaneous renal haemorrhage in end-stage renal disease [^115ZPJdF]. Insights into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Spontaneous renal haemorrhage (SRH) may present with the classical triad of acute lumbar or abdominal pain, a palpable mass, and hypovolemic shock. Alternatively, manifestations may be nonspecific with variable degrees of haemodynamic compromise. Practically, SRH should be strongly suspected in every patient with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), particularly those on haemodialysis, who present with varying severity of abdominal or flank pain, hypotension, and haematocrit drop. Prompt imaging investigation is imperative. Ultrasound may quickly identify abnormal perinephric collections compressing or displacing the kidney, with decreasing echogenicity during their temporal evolution. However, ultrasound has limited diagnostic accuracy because of patient-related technical factors and does not reliably differentiate echogenic clotted blood from solid tissue.

Multidetector computed tomography (CT) represents the imaging modality of choice to diagnose suspected intra-abdominal bleeding and differentiate it from other causes of acute abdomen. CT has absolute (100%) sensitivity for the detection of retroperitoneal haematomas, which appear as more or less hyperattenuating (35 to 70 Hounsfield units) collections on precontrast scans depending on their more or less acute stage. In our experience, the typical appearance of SRH in acquired cystic kidney disease (ACKD) includes small, poorly perfused kidneys with multiple cysts and a sizeable crescent- or biconvex-shaped subcapsular haematoma exerting compression on the adjacent renal parenchyma. CT allows accurate size measurement and monitoring of haematomas and differentiates subcapsular from perinephric haematomas.

### Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis [^112Lk5oH]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis is a rare condition in children. A 7-year-old boy developed right flank pain and tenderness one month after an appendectomy. An abdominal computed tomography scan documented a right renal mass, leading to the performance of a right nephrectomy. The pathological report confirmed xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis. He experienced an uneventful recovery. Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis should be included in the differential diagnosis of children with fever, weight loss, flank tenderness, and a renal mass.

### Postpartum ovarian vein thrombosis with left renal venous infarction after vaginal delivery [^112g8wDz]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

A primipara in her late 20s presented with abdominal pain and pain in the left flank 14 days following a ventouse delivery. She was treated with antibiotics, antiemetics, and analgesics with the initial differential diagnosis of cystitis, pyelonephritis, or nephrolithiasis. Despite the treatment, the patient experienced increased colic pain and nausea. An ultrasound showed an enlarged left kidney, suggesting pyelonephritis, and the antibiotic treatment was adjusted accordingly. Despite additional pain medication, pain relief could not be achieved.

The diagnosis of ovarian venous thrombosis was considered, and an abdominal CT scan confirmed the diagnosis. The patient was treated with anticoagulant therapy. A hypercoagulability work-up revealed a heterozygous mutation of the Factor V Leiden. Our patient awaits a hematologic follow-up.

### Flank pain and hematuria is not always a kidney stone [^116kWkn6]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Patients with flank pain and hematuria commonly present to the emergency department with nephrolithiasis. It is important to consider other potential less common differentials to avoid diagnostic anchoring. We present a case of a patient with symptoms typical of nephrolithiasis who was eventually diagnosed with a Page kidney, causing secondary hypertension. A 50-year-old male with no significant past medical history presented to the Emergency Department with severe left-sided flank pain, vomiting, and blood-tinged urine.

Initial investigations pursued a diagnosis of nephrolithiasis, revealing a left renal subcapsular hematoma on a non-contrast CT. A subsequent CTA showed no active hemorrhage. Despite the absence of recent trauma, the patient was hypertensive upon evaluation. Urology was consulted, and management of the patient's hypertension was initiated. He was diagnosed with Page kidney and admitted for observation and hypertension management with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor.

- **Page Kidney**: This diagnosis involves compression of the renal parenchyma by a hematoma or mass, causing secondary hypertension through the activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Causes may include traumatic subcapsular hematoma, renal cyst rupture, tumor, hemorrhage, or arteriovenous malformation, among others. Treatment may involve conservative measures, including hypertension management, or more invasive measures like evacuation or nephrectomy.

We describe the case of a patient presumed to have nephrolithiasis, presenting with typical left-sided flank pain, diagnosed with Page kidney.

### Acute flank pain: Comparison of unenhanced helical CT and ultrasonography in detecting causes other than ureterolithiasis [^116F1Q4Z]. Emergency Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

Several conditions can clinically mimic renal colic. We assessed the accuracy of non-contrast-enhanced helical CT and ultrasonography (US) in providing alternative explanations for flank pain. Over a 3-year period, 181 patients with acute flank pain underwent US and non-contrast-enhanced helical CT in a blinded sequence. Their efficacy in detecting both alternative causes of pain and additional findings unrelated to the pain was assessed in 160 cases with a confirmed diagnosis. An alternative cause was found in 23 cases (14%).

- **US findings**: US gave 4 false-negative results (1 acute appendicitis, 1 ovarian cyst torsion, 1 diverticulitis, and 1 papillary necrosis) and 2 false-positive results (1 acute pyelonephritis and 1 diverticulitis), with a sensitivity of 78% and a specificity of 98% for nonlithiasic causes.

- **CT findings**: CT gave 5 false-negative results (1 complicated ovarian cyst, 1 pleuritis, 1 epididymitis, 1 acute pyelonephritis, and 1 papillary necrosis) and 1 false-positive (1 simple ovarian cyst described as a complicated lesion), resulting in a sensitivity of 74% and a specificity of 99% for diagnosing alternative causes.

A wide spectrum of findings can be identified in subjects imaged for flank pain. Non-contrast-enhanced helical CT and US have comparable accuracy in diagnosing causes other than stone disease. There were 130 additional US findings in 68 patients and 151 additional CT findings in 77 patients.

### Radiation dose reduction for CT assessment of urolithiasis using iterative reconstruction: A prospective intra-individual study [^112NLLUu]. European Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

The most frequent cause of acute flank pain is urolithiasis, affecting 3–5% of the population. The risk of recurrence of urolithiasis is high, with 50% after 5 years and more than 72% after 20 years. In the United States, the estimated annual cost for stone disease was over US$10.3 billion in 2006, which marked an almost fivefold increase in 6 years, and this rise continues to persist today.

Unenhanced computed tomography (CT) is often used for the diagnosis of urolithiasis. Compared to ultrasonography, CT offers the possibility to detect extra-urinary causes of flank pain and has higher specificity and sensitivity. The guidelines of the European Association of Urology and the American College of Radiology advise using low-dose CT in patients with acute disease and suspicion of urolithiasis, while the American Urological Association provides no clear recommendation. However, CT has several disadvantages such as higher costs compared to ultrasonography, limited availability in developing countries, and the associated exposure to ionising radiation.

Technical advancements like iterative reconstruction (IR) algorithms have resulted in substantial radiation dose reductions. IR results in reduced noise, allowing the acquisition of images at reduced radiation dose levels without intrinsically hampering image quality. Several studies have investigated the potential of IR for unenhanced abdominal CT, with most studies focusing on urinary stone detection and image quality. The purpose of this study was to assess the performance of hybrid IR (HIR) and model-based IR (MIR) in this context.

### Differentiating kidney stones from phleboliths in unenhanced low-dose computed tomography using radiomics and machine learning [^117Syiqk]. European Radiology (2019). High credibility.

Distinguishing between kidney stones and phleboliths can constitute a diagnostic challenge in patients undergoing unenhanced low-dose CT (LDCT) for acute flank pain. This study investigates the accuracy of radiomics and a machine-learning classifier in differentiating between kidney stones and phleboliths on LDCT.

Radiomics features were extracted following a semi-automatic segmentation of kidney stones and phleboliths for two independent consecutive cohorts of patients undergoing LDCT for acute flank pain. Radiomics features from the first cohort of patients (n = 369) were used to train a machine-learning model designed to distinguish kidney stones (n = 211) from phleboliths (n = 201). Classification performance was assessed on the second independent cohort (i.e. testing set; kidney stones n = 24; phleboliths n = 23) using positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV), area under the receiver operating curves (AUC), and permutation testing.

The machine-learning classification model trained on radiomics features achieved an overall accuracy of 85.1% on the independent testing set, with an AUC of 0.902, PPV of 81.5%, and NPV of 90.0%. Classification accuracy was significantly better than chance on permutation testing (p < 0.05, permutation p value).

Radiomics and machine learning enable accurate differentiation between kidney stones and phleboliths on LDCT in patients presenting with acute flank pain.

- **Key points**: Combining a machine-learning algorithm with radiomics features extracted for abdominopelvic calcifications can significantly aid in accurate diagnosis.

### Derivation and validation of a clinical prediction rule for uncomplicated ureteral stone — the STONE score: retrospective and prospective observational cohort studies [^114KVLtP]. BMJ (2014). High credibility.

Of the 5383 "flank pain protocol" CT scans performed in the emergency departments on patients 18 years of age or older during the retrospective period, 1853 (34.4%) were randomly selected for full record review. Of these, 1040 were complete records with no exclusion criteria. Approximately half (49.5%; 515 of 1040) of the patients had a ureteral stone causing symptoms on their computed tomogram, whereas 2.9% (30 of 1040) had acutely important alternative causes of symptoms. Inter-rater reliability for categorization of the CT result yielded a κ of 0.75–0.80, indicating excellent agreement. Significant factors for the presence or absence of ureteral stone on univariate analysis were identified.

- **Prevalence of ureteral stone by STONE score category**: Percentages at the top of bars indicate prevalence of ureteral stone in each group. Values under bars indicate the number within derivation and validation sets that fell within risk stratums.

- **Table 1: Demographics of derivation and validation cohorts**: Values are numbers (percentages) unless stated otherwise. Note that ED refers to emergency department and CT refers to computed tomography.

- **Table 2: Significant predictors for presence or absence of ureteral stone**: Includes results from univariate analysis of derivation set, with odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. NA denotes not applicable.

### Renal vein thrombosis mimicking urinary calculus: A dilemma of diagnosis [^112mUpVE]. BMC Urology (2015). Low credibility.

The clinical manifestations of renal vein thrombosis (RVT) in adult patients vary, along with the rapidity and degree of venous occlusion. Symptoms of RVT can include acute flank pain, hematuria, and deterioration of renal function, although RVT is usually asymptomatic. RVT with flank pain and hematuria is often misdiagnosed as renal colic originating from a ureteric or renal calculus, especially in young and otherwise healthy patients. This report describes an unusual patient with RVT, who presented with flank pain and calcified RVT mimicking a urinary calculus.
