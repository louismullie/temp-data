## Question

Work up for h8gh serum copper level

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to work up a high serum copper level. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the abnormal copper result and ruling out pre-analytical or acute-phase confounders. Then, I should review the core biochemical tests (ceruloplasmin, 24-hour urinary copper, and how to handle NCC versus REC). Next, I will examine the clinical exam features and targeted liver workup. After that, I need to consider when liver biopsy for hepatic copper quantification is appropriate. I should then determine the role and timing of ATP7B genetic testing. I will also work through the differential diagnosis for hypercupremia. Finally, I need to plan family screening and define monitoring targets if Wilson disease is diagnosed, while calling out key caveats and pitfalls.

> Let me first confirm the elevation and exclude pre-analytical issues, because a spurious high copper can mislead the entire workup; I should ensure the sample was drawn into copper-free containers and that the assay can accurately measure down to very low levels, and if there is any doubt, I will repeat the serum copper under proper conditions to avoid trace metal contamination [^115zQeMc]. Wait, let me verify whether inflammation could be driving a false-positive increase, since copper and ceruloplasmin are positive acute-phase reactants; I need to check CRP and the clinical context before I jump to conclusions about copper overload, as systemic inflammation in conditions like diabetes and heart failure can elevate ceruloplasmin and total copper independently of Wilson disease [^1179Kyh4] [^113k6ynm]. I should also consider context that might raise or lower pretest probability — age/phenotype spectrum of Wilson disease, recent bariatric surgery, parenteral nutrition, or exogenous copper intake — because these can shift interpretation and sometimes account for elevated serum copper without Wilson disease [^116sZv7A] [^116wHnTj] [^113aiHJJ].

> Next, I should review the core biochemical tests in parallel and interpret them carefully, because no single test rules Wilson disease in or out; I will obtain serum ceruloplasmin and a basal 24-hour urinary copper, recognizing that an extremely low ceruloplasmin strengthens suspicion but normal values do not exclude Wilson disease, and that a urinary copper > 100 mcg/24 h in symptomatic patients or > 40 mcg/24 h in asymptomatic or pediatric patients raises concern and requires clinical correlation [^116YFGQ9] [^113ZpQ3Y] [^113AudPD]. Hold on, I should verify how I use non-ceruloplasmin-bound copper (NCC); while the formula NCC = total copper − 3 × ceruloplasmin is widely used, it is method-dependent and can yield biologically implausible negative values, so I must be cautious not to over-interpret it in isolation or as a diagnostic test [^115zQeMc] [^1116REez]. Let me also consider relative exchangeable copper (REC) if available; REC directly assesses the labile copper pool and has shown excellent performance for diagnosis in chronic settings and in acute liver failure with cutoffs around 14–18%, so I should measure it when I can, especially if the presentation is equivocal or fulminant [^112JPn38] [^114ZyFwR] [^113y4m1Q].

> I will now examine the bedside clinical evaluation, because the pattern of symptoms can recalibrate likelihood before invasive testing; I need to check for Kayser-Fleischer rings with a slit-lamp exam, obtain a focused neurologic assessment for tremor, dystonia, dysarthria, and screen for hepatic stigmata, neuropsychiatric features, and Coombs-negative hemolysis, being careful not to dismiss Wilson disease if any single feature is absent [^111AXyCv] [^114mWSnQ] [^116sZv7A]. Wait, let me verify that ocular findings are more common with neurologic presentations and may be absent in purely hepatic disease, so a normal slit-lamp does not exclude Wilson disease and should not delay further workup when suspicion is high [^116sZv7A].

> Next, I should review the liver-specific workup; I will obtain liver tests and noninvasive fibrosis assessment, because liver involvement spans asymptomatic enzyme elevations to cirrhosis and impacts subsequent decisions, and this helps anchor the phenotype even when the initial trigger is neurologic or psychiatric [^1138LeVU]. If the diagnosis remains uncertain after noninvasive testing, I need to consider hepatic copper quantification on a dry-weight biopsy core; values at or above 250 mcg/g dry weight are highly suggestive of Wilson disease, but I must differentiate from cholestatic diseases and remember that histology lacks specific features and copper staining adds limited value in modern algorithms [^112BwSAq] [^117DthUu] [^114nBHfA]. Hold on, I should verify that hepatic copper level does not correlate with the degree of inflammation or fibrosis and should not be used to stage severity, preventing misinterpretation of tissue burden as disease activity [^112BwSAq].

> Let me consider genetic testing now; I should confirm that ATP7B sequencing is indicated when biochemical tests are equivocal, for ALF presentations where rapid confirmation aids family planning (without delaying urgent therapy), and for cascade screening of first-degree relatives, because molecular confirmation establishes a definitive diagnosis and informs family risk [^116wKu3H] [^116ubvZx] [^11582qzu]. Wait, I should double-check that in suspected ALF due to Wilson disease, I start treatment and prioritize transplant evaluation without waiting for genetics, using REC and clinical scores to guide urgency while sequencing proceeds in parallel [^112JPn38] [^113AudPD].

> I need to ensure I broaden the differential diagnosis for elevated serum copper before anchoring on Wilson disease; cholestatic liver disease, acute hepatitis or cirrhosis of other etiologies, hematologic malignancies, and exogenous copper sources can all elevate serum copper, while conditions like Menkes disease or aceruloplasminemia typically present with low copper and ceruloplasmin and therefore represent conceptual opposites included for completeness in the copper workup [^11317Qxf] [^116ohh8D] [^113zaTwb]. But wait, what if the patient recently had bariatric surgery or is on parenteral nutrition? I should confirm supplement exposures and local environmental factors because both deficiency and excess patterns have been reported peri-bariatric, and inflammation can spuriously elevate serum copper in obesity cohorts, necessitating repeat testing after CRP normalizes when feasible [^116wHnTj] [^115PxdRf].

> Now, let me outline family screening if Wilson disease is confirmed or strongly suspected; I should offer molecular testing to first-degree relatives for the proband's ATP7B variants, or if genetics is not immediately available, screen with ceruloplasmin, 24-hour urinary copper, and REC where available, mindful of age-specific thresholds in children and the possibility of asymptomatic disease requiring early detection and treatment [^112p3rcr] [^115QC5Rn] [^114peS7m]. Hold on, I should verify that normal values in some copper tests do not safely exclude disease in relatives, so I will avoid premature reassurance and proceed to genotyping whenever possible to close the loop on cascade screening [^116wKu3H].

> If Wilson disease is diagnosed, I should confirm baseline status and define concrete monitoring targets; I will assess neuropsychiatric function and liver tests, monitor 24-hour urinary copper and non-ceruloplasmin copper or exchangeable copper periodically, and use therapeutic benchmarks such as urinary copper on chelation typically > 100 mcg/24 h and on zinc maintenance falling to ≤ 125 mcg/24 h, while aiming for non-ceruloplasmin copper below about 20 mcg/dL when using that metric, adjusting therapy for trends and clinical status rather than any single value alone [^115PLjoA] [^115zQeMc]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost used hepatic copper to titrate therapy, but I should correct that; liver copper is not an appropriate tool for treatment monitoring, and I need to watch for overtreatment signaled by cytopenias, tissue iron retention with raised ferritin, very low serum copper, and disproportionately low 24-hour urinary copper on the given chelator or zinc regimen, prompting dose reduction or brief interruption with close follow-up [^115zQeMc] [^115PLjoA].

> Finally, I should double-check key caveats and clinical pearls so I do not over- or under-diagnose; diagnosis is integrative and best standardized with the Leipzig score plus REC where available, especially in ALF where REC performs well and treatment must not be delayed, while in pediatrics I will apply lower urinary copper thresholds and recognize that higher hepatic copper can be seen in earlier onset disease without implying worse fibrosis on its own [^114riHm4] [^112JPn38]. Let me reconsider assay variability and test stewardship; NCC and copper/ceruloplasmin ratios are method-dependent with inter-lab differences, so I should use lab-specific cutoffs and avoid indiscriminate ceruloplasmin ordering in very low-pretest-probability populations to prevent false positives and diagnostic inertia [^115ZUfdr] [^111SUkaP] [^114WpeTG].

The workup for a high serum copper level should start with a **focused history and exam** to identify symptoms, exposures, and risk factors, then proceed to **confirmatory testing** with serum ceruloplasmin, 24-hour urinary copper, and liver function tests [^114mWSnQ] [^113AudPD]. If **Wilson disease** is suspected, add slit-lamp exam for Kayser-Fleischer rings, ATP7B genetic testing, and consider liver biopsy for hepatic copper quantification [^114iWgVW] [^1155BFdt]. Also assess for other causes such as cholestasis, inflammation, or exogenous copper exposure, and monitor trends with repeat testing and clinical correlation [^11317Qxf].

---

## Clinical history and physical examination

A detailed clinical history and physical examination are **essential first steps** in evaluating elevated serum copper levels. Key aspects include:

- **Symptoms**: Fatigue, jaundice, abdominal pain, neurological symptoms (tremor, dysarthria, psychiatric changes) [^114mWSnQ].

- **Family history**: Liver disease, neurological disorders, or known genetic disorders of copper metabolism [^114mWSnQ].

- **Exposure history**: Occupational or environmental exposure to copper, dietary supplements, or copper-containing water pipes.

- **Physical examination**: Signs of liver disease (hepatomegaly, jaundice), neurological abnormalities, and Kayser-Fleischer rings (brownish-green corneal rings) [^114mWSnQ] [^111AXyCv].

---

## Laboratory evaluation

Laboratory tests are **critical** for confirming the elevation and identifying underlying causes:

| **Test** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|
| Serum ceruloplasmin | Major copper-binding protein; low levels suggest Wilson disease; elevated in inflammation [^113ZpQ3Y] [^113k6ynm] |
| 24-hour urinary copper excretion | Elevated (> 100 µg/24h) in Wilson disease; useful for diagnosis and monitoring [^113AudPD] |
| Liver function tests (ALT, AST, ALP, bilirubin) | Assess liver involvement; elevated in hepatic copper accumulation [^1138LeVU] |
| Complete blood count (CBC) | Evaluate for hemolytic anemia, common in Wilson disease |
| Serum free copper (non-ceruloplasmin-bound copper) | Elevated in Wilson disease; useful for monitoring treatment [^113ct7gH] |

---

## Imaging studies

Imaging studies assess organ involvement and guide further diagnostic steps. Liver ultrasound or MRI can be used to evaluate **hepatic copper accumulation**, liver structure, and fibrosis. Brain MRI evaluates **neurological involvement**, particularly when Wilson disease is suspected.

---

## Genetic testing

Genetic testing is essential for confirming hereditary copper metabolism disorders. ATP7B gene analysis confirms the diagnosis of **Wilson disease** and enables family screening [^114iWgVW]. Family screening involves testing **first-degree relatives** for ATP7B mutations and abnormal copper metabolism [^112p3rcr].

---

## Liver biopsy

Liver biopsy is indicated when the diagnosis remains uncertain or to confirm hepatic copper accumulation. Hepatic copper quantification with levels **≥ 250 µg/g dry weight** strongly suggests Wilson disease [^1155BFdt]. Histological evaluation assesses **liver damage and fibrosis** [^117DthUu].

---

## Differential diagnosis

Elevated serum copper levels can arise from several conditions:

- **Wilson disease**: Genetic disorder causing copper accumulation in liver and brain.

- **Cholestatic liver diseases**: Primary biliary cholangitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis.

- **Inflammatory conditions**: Elevated ceruloplasmin as an acute-phase reactant.

- **Exogenous copper exposure**: Occupational, environmental, or dietary sources.

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular monitoring and follow-up are **essential** to assess treatment efficacy and prevent complications. This includes tracking serum copper and ceruloplasmin to monitor trends and treatment response [^11317Qxf], measuring 24-hour urinary copper excretion to evaluate treatment adequacy and adherence [^113ct7gH], and conducting regular clinical assessments, including neurological and hepatic evaluations [^115zQeMc].

---

## Management strategies

Management is tailored to the **underlying cause**:

- **Wilson disease**: Chelating agents (penicillamine, trientine), zinc therapy, liver transplantation in severe cases [^114bpFvA].

- **Cholestatic liver diseases**: Treat underlying liver condition.

- **Exogenous copper exposure**: Remove source of exposure, supportive care.

---

A structured approach to elevated serum copper includes **history, exam, labs, imaging, genetics, and biopsy** when needed, with management tailored to the cause and regular monitoring to guide therapy and prevent complications.

The AASLD 2022 guidelines recommend that in the diagnostic investigation of Wilson's disease, particularly regarding serum ceruloplasmin and urinary copper excretion, it is important to recognize that basal 24-hour urinary copper excretion in symptomatic patients with Wilson disease is typically greater than 100 mcg/24 hours. However, a lower reference value of more than 40 mcg/24 hours may indicate Wilson disease in asymptomatic or pediatric patients. This finding necessitates clinical correlation and further investigation.

### Estimating risk from copper excess in human populations [^111aRtG5]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2008). Low credibility.

Risk assessment for nutrients typically assumes a single population with a normal distribution of indices of requirements and excess. For copper, toxic levels are defined as intakes above the upper level. However, due to the lack of noninvasive, sensitive biomarkers for storage or early damage from excess, excess is currently based on the infrequent occurrence of clinical diseases, such as unexplained liver cirrhosis.

We examine the limitations of this approach for copper, considering the very low prevalence of clinical and subclinical disease. We suggest that the population risk for copper excess should be based on hepatic copper loading as a potentially quantifiable measurement. The challenge ahead is to develop biomarkers that can predict the population risk of elevated hepatic copper stores and, consequently, the possibility of disease in a population.

### The copper/caeruloplasmin ratio in routine clinical practice in different laboratories [^115ZUfdr]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2009). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of copper deficiency and excess states is challenging. It was hoped that non-caeruloplasmin-bound ("free") copper would reduce this difficulty; however, it has its own problems. The copper/caeruloplasmin ratio has been advocated as an alternative index of copper status, especially as it would not need gender-derived or age-derived reference intervals. However, there are no comparative data for different populations using different assays.

- **Method**: Independent paired copper and caeruloplasmin data were retrospectively obtained for three laboratories. From these data, the copper/caeruloplasmin ratio was calculated, and descriptive statistics for the populations and methods were obtained. The relationship between the copper/caeruloplasmin ratio and both copper and caeruloplasmin was also investigated for the three laboratories.

- **Results**: All three datasets displayed a non-Gaussian distribution. The Burton median was statistically different from the two other medians, which did not differ significantly from each other. The regression lines for both copper and caeruloplasmin with the ratio differed from each other.

- **Conclusion**: The copper/caeruloplasmin ratio behaves differently depending on the laboratory, the population studied, or both. Thus, cut-offs in the literature are not transferable; each laboratory should therefore derive its own cut-offs.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Wilson's disease, more specifically with respect to serum ceruloplasmin and urinary copper excretion, the EASL/ERN-Rare Liver 2025 guidelines recommend obtaining both serum ceruloplasmin and basal 24-hour urinary copper excretion as the first step for screening for copper metabolism abnormalities in adult patients. These patients present with either predominantly hepatic, neurological, or neuropsychiatric manifestations. Obtain relative exchangeable copper determination in serum if available.

### Elevation of serum copper in the New Orleans bariatric clinic population: the norm or geographically localized findings [^115PxdRf]. Obesity Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

Circulating micronutrient levels of both serum copper and zinc have been studied to varying degrees in both the general public and patients who have undergone bariatric surgery. According to the 2019 ASMBS clinical guidelines, copper supplementation is recommended for patients undergoing metabolic surgery, especially after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and duodenal switch. Copper excess has not been previously reported to any significant degree in any population.

In this study, we investigate an elevated serum copper level in the pre-surgical intervention population of the Bariatric Center of the University Medical Center-New Orleans, a primary safety net hospital for the state of Louisiana.

- **Methods**: Five hundred and five consecutive patients from the bariatric clinic undergoing a workup for surgical intervention were assessed. Patients were included regardless of whether they proceeded to surgery. The study was conducted as a retrospective review of deidentified data that was collected as part of our routine workup for bariatric surgery.

- **Results**: The clinic's study population had a mean BMI of approximately 50 kg/m², with 91% of the population reporting female and 69% an African American race. It was discovered that 26% of the patients had an elevated copper level of > 155 mcg/dl. Additional analysis was performed to elucidate an environmental role in the elevation through qualitative analysis of patients' locations of residence using their reported home addresses. Additional variables were studied as well.

### Copper deficiency and excess in infancy: Developing a research agenda [^112c7NXa]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2003). Low credibility.

Copper deficiency and excess have been recognized as potential health problems for infants and children worldwide. Clinical manifestations of copper deficiency and excess are well characterized, but the precise sequence by which high copper intake interacts with genetic control systems, leading to liver damage in infants, is unknown. The possibility that genetic mutations or epigenetic factors related to the functional development of copper homeostasis could make otherwise normal infants on normal copper intake more susceptible to copper toxicity has been an issue of concern.

In January 2001, a group of pediatricians and researchers interested in this area met at Tegernsee, Bavaria, Germany, to review the state of knowledge on the topic. They addressed six main issues:

- **The relevance of copper deficit and excess as health problems**: Discussion on how copper imbalance influences health.
- **The appropriate biomarkers to identify and characterize copper status**: Identifying markers that best indicate copper levels.
- **The genetic variability in copper metabolism**: Examining how genetics affect copper processing.
- **The mechanisms of whole body copper homeostasis in early life and their changes with age**: Understanding how copper balance is maintained and alters over time.
- **The development of experimental and animal models to address research questions on copper homeostasis in infants**: Creating models to study copper balance.
- **The safe upper and lower limits of copper intake/exposure from water and food**: Establishing safe consumption levels.

We present here the highlights of the discussions and the main conclusions of the meeting.

### Prospective evaluation of the diagnostic accuracy of hepatic copper content, as determined using the entire core of a liver biopsy sample [^112BwSAq]. Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

The final diagnosis of WD was made in 178 patients, including 105 H patients (59.0%), 25 N1 patients (14.0%), 31 N2 patients (17.4%), and 17 P patients (9.6%). Among these, 174 (97.8%) had a WD score of at least 4, whereas only 4 had a WD score less than 4. Among these 4 patients, 3 were siblings of index cases and exhibited mildly decreased ceruloplasmin levels and markedly increased liver copper levels. The remaining patient was evaluated due to elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase and serum aspartate aminotransferase for 3 years. This patient had a ceruloplasmin level of 272 mg/L and markedly elevated liver copper content of 1,125.0 μg/g dry wt. Four patients who refused genetic testing were treated with penicillamine or zinc, and their liver function tests gradually returned to normal. They were diagnosed with WD based on a combination of WD score, family history, and positive response to chelator therapy, despite having WD scores of less than 4.

Hepatic copper level in WD patients did not correlate with sex, the grade of hepatic inflammation, or the stage of hepatic fibrosis. It negatively correlated with age at diagnosis (r = −0.304; P = 0.001). The mean hepatic copper level was significantly higher in H patients than in other phenotypes (P = 0.001). It was also higher in patients 14 years old or younger compared to older patients. All 105 H patients, including 60 patients 14 years old or younger, had hepatic copper levels over 250 μg/g dry wt. Among 31 N2 patients, 7 (22.6%) had hepatic copper levels.

### EASL-ERN clinical practice guidelines on Wilson's disease [^113ct7gH]. Journal of Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for Wilson's disease, particularly concerning clinical and laboratory monitoring, the EASL/ERN-Rare Liver 2025 guidelines recommend monitoring the adequacy of treatment with D-penicillamine or trientine throughout all stages of treatment. This should be accomplished by measuring 24-hour urinary copper excretion and serum non-ceruloplasmin-bound copper or serum exchangeable copper whenever available.

### Serum ceruloplasmin oxidase activity is a sensitive and highly specific diagnostic marker for Wilson's disease [^112V74X8]. Journal of Hepatology (2009). Low credibility.

A low serum ceruloplasmin concentration is considered diagnostic for Wilson's disease. We aimed to evaluate an enzymatic test for ceruloplasmin oxidase activity and to compare it with the routinely used immunological ceruloplasmin measurement.

- **Methods**: Serum ceruloplasmin was measured enzymatically with o-dianisidine dihydrochloride as substrate and immunologically. We analyzed 110 Wilson's disease patients, 52 healthy controls, and 51 patients with impaired liver function not due to Wilson's disease. Assay performance was tested by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, McNemar test, and Spearman's rank correlation.

- **Results**: The greatest sum of sensitivity and specificity was observed for the enzymatic ceruloplasmin assay at a cut-off point of 55 U/L (93.6% and 100%, respectively) and for the immunologic assay at a cut-off point of 0.19 g/L (93.6% and 78.8%, respectively). For healthy controls, the differences in specificity between both assays were statistically significant (McNemar, p = 0.02). When patients with impaired liver function were included in the control group, specificity declined to 84.5% for the enzymatic assay and 68.9% for the immunologic assay. The correlation between the enzymatic and immunologic assays was high in healthy controls (r = 0.94), but weaker in Wilson's disease patients (r = 0.70) and patients with impaired liver function not due to Wilson's disease (r = 0.65).

For the enzymatic assay, the best cut-off point for predicting Wilson's disease was estimated to be 55 U/L. Our data suggest that the…

### Value of serum nonceruloplasmin copper for prediction of mild cognitive impairment conversion to Alzheimer disease [^113hvxpb]. Annals of Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Meta-analyses show that nonbound ceruloplasmin (non-Cp) copper (also known as free or labile copper) in serum is higher in patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) and differentiates subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from healthy controls. However, a longitudinal study on an MCI cohort has not yet been performed to assess the accuracy of non-Cp copper for the prediction of conversion from MCI to AD during a long-term follow-up.

The study included 42 MCI converters and 99 stable MCI subjects. We assessed levels of copper, ceruloplasmin, non-Cp copper, iron, transferrin, ferritin, and APOE genotype. A multiple Cox regression analysis — with age, sex, baseline Mini-Mental State Examination, APOE4, iron, non-Cp copper, transferrin, ferritin, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertension as covariates — was applied to predict the conversion from MCI to AD.

Among the evaluated parameters, the only significant predictor of conversion to AD was non-Cp copper (hazard ratio = 1.23, 95% confidence interval = 1.03–1.47, p = 0.022); for each additional micromole per liter unit (μmol/l) of non-Cp copper, the hazard increased by approximately 20%. Subjects with non-Cp copper levels > 1.6 μmol/l had a hazard conversion rate (50% of conversion in 4 years) that was about three times higher than those with values ≤ 1.6 μmol/l (< 20% in 4 years). The rate of conversion was similar between APOE4 carriers and noncarriers (p = 0.321), indicating that the non-Cp copper association was independent of APOE4.

Non-Cp copper appears to predict conversion from MCI to AD.

### Prognostic value of elevated serum ceruloplasmin levels in patients with heart failure [^113k6ynm]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2014). Low credibility.

Ceruloplasmin (Cp) is a copper-binding acute-phase protein that is increased in inflammatory states and deficient in Wilson's disease. Recent studies demonstrate that increased levels of Cp are associated with an increased risk of developing heart failure. Our objective was to test the hypothesis that serum Cp provides incremental and independent prediction of survival in stable patients with heart failure.

- **Methods and results**: We measured serum Cp levels in 890 patients with stable heart failure undergoing elective cardiac evaluation, which included coronary angiography. We examined the role of Cp levels in predicting survival over 5 years of follow-up. The mean Cp level was 26.6 ± 6.9 mg/dL and demonstrated a relatively weak correlation with B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP; r = 0.187; P < .001). Increased Cp levels were associated with increased 5-year all-cause mortality (quartile [Q] 4 vs Q1 hazard ratio [HR] 1.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4–2.8; P < .001). When controlled for coronary disease traditional risk factors, creatinine clearance, dialysis, body mass index, medications, history of myocardial infarction, BNP, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), heart rate, QRS duration, left bundle branch blockage, and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placement, higher Cp remained an independent predictor of increased mortality (Q4 vs Q1 HR 1.7, 95% CI 1.1–2.6; P < .05). Model quality was improved with the addition of Cp to the aforementioned covariables, showing a net reclassification improvement of 9.3% (P < .001).

Ceruloplasmin is thus identified as an independent predictor of mortality in patients with heart failure.

### Performance of relative exchangeable copper for the diagnosis of Wilson disease in acute liver failure [^113tLamh]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2025). Low credibility.

The calculated non-ceruloplasmin-bound copper (NCC) has historically been used to monitor the evolution of Wilson disease (WD), but it has never been validated for diagnosis. Several limitations have been raised against the utilization of this method, particularly its dependence on the method employed for ceruloplasmin determination, which can sometimes lead to negative and hard-to-interpret values.

A different assay to directly determine the NCC is known as the exchangeable copper (CuEXC) and represents the labile portion of copper bound to albumin and other peptides but not to ceruloplasmin.

The ratio of the CuEXC to total serum copper is known as relative exchangeable copper (REC). The REC has demonstrated its utility in the diagnosis of WD. In a previous study, we reported that both the sensitivity and specificity of the REC for the diagnosis of WD were 100%, comparing cohorts of adults and children with WD with other hepatic diseases in a chronic and stable setting, thus not including any case of acute liver failure (ALF). The present study aims to evaluate the performance of the REC in diagnosing WD in ALF.

### Total and exchangeable copper assay using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and establishment of a pediatric reference interval [^114Zfeym]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Recently, an exchangeable copper (CuEXC) assay has been suggested as a robust and feasible diagnostic tool for Wilson disease (WD). Although WD is a disorder that requires lifelong treatment and monitoring, few data are currently available regarding the status of copper levels in children.

The objective of the study was to evaluate the performance of copper assays and establish a reference interval for total copper and CuEXC in the pediatric population.

Serum samples from children aged 1–5 (n = 122), 6–12 (n = 125), and 13–18 years (n = 120) were analyzed. Total copper and CuEXC concentrations were directly measured using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, and relative CuEXC levels were calculated. Total copper reference intervals, CuEXC levels, and relative CuEXC levels were determined based on the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the data with 90% confidence intervals.

The results indicated significant differences in the median concentrations of total copper and relative CuEXC among the age groups. Reference intervals determined for total copper were 82 to 167, 75 to 139, and 64 to 133 μg/dL for children aged 1 to 5, 6 to 12, and 13 to 18 years, respectively. The reference intervals for CuEXC were 4.29 to 9.79, 4.02 to 9.09, and 3.55 to 8.25 μg/dL for children aged 1 to 5, 6 to 12, and 13 to 18 years, respectively. Among 11 patients with suspected WD, relative CuEXC values were elevated in all 3 diagnosed with WD.

The pediatric reference intervals derived in this study are expected to be useful for diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and treatment monitoring in clinical settings.

### Mutations in Slc33a1 cause a lethal autosomal-recessive disorder with congenital cataracts, hearing loss, and low serum copper and ceruloplasmin [^113kXNQC]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2012). Low credibility.

Low copper and ceruloplasmin in serum are the diagnostic hallmarks for Menkes disease, Wilson disease, and aceruloplasminemia. We report on five patients from four unrelated families with these biochemical findings who presented with a lethal autosomal-recessive syndrome of congenital cataracts, hearing loss, and severe developmental delay. Cerebral MRI showed pronounced cerebellar hypoplasia and hypomyelination. Homozygosity mapping was performed and displayed a region of commonality among three families at chromosome 3q25. Deep sequencing and conventional sequencing disclosed homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations for all affected subjects in SLC33A1, encoding a highly conserved acetylCoA transporter (AT-1) required for acetylation of multiple gangliosides and glycoproteins. The mutations were found to cause reduced or absent AT-1 expression and abnormal intracellular localization of the protein.

We also demonstrated that AT-1 knockdown in HepG2 cells leads to reduced ceruloplasmin secretion, indicating that the low copper in serum is due to reduced ceruloplasmin levels and is not a sign of copper deficiency. The severity of the phenotype implies an essential role of AT-1 in the proper posttranslational modification of numerous proteins, without which normal lens and brain development is interrupted. Furthermore, AT-1 defects are a new and important differential diagnosis in patients with low copper and ceruloplasmin in serum.

### Regulatory frameworks for copper considering chronic exposures of the population [^113aiHJJ]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2008). Low credibility.

Copper is an essential nutrient that is toxic in excess. Copper intakes from a balanced diet appear to meet the needs of most healthy individuals because overt deficiency and toxicity are rare. Some uncertainty, however, persists due to limitations in currently available biomarkers used to assess copper status and the paucity of data available to establish tolerable upper levels of intake.

Policies and regulations pertaining to food fortification, nutritional supplements, and drinking water appear to be effective in providing adequate copper intakes in many populations. However, high levels of exposure through overzealous fortification, supplementation, or drinking water exposure may be possible under some circumstances.

Surveillance and monitoring programs to evaluate copper exposures of human populations should continue and should be refined as new biomarkers become available.

### Serum copper modulates cognitive function in diabetic patients via an HDL-C-mediated pathway: identification of a 25 µg/dL exploratory threshold [^115Rk4fx]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). Low credibility.

Associations between serum copper, biomarkers, and cognitive function in diabetic participants

In further analyses focusing on diabetic participants, multivariable linear regression revealed key associations between serum copper, biomarkers, and cognitive function (Table 3). Serum copper was negatively associated with AFT scores (β = −0.132, P = 0.034) but showed no significant relationship with DSST scores (β = −0.014, P = 0.948). Among other trace elements, Cd exhibited robust negative correlations with both AFT (β = −1.742, P = 0.001) and DSST scores (β = −5.872, P < 0.001). Co was negatively associated with DSST scores (β = −0.516, P = 0.001), and Pb also showed a negative association with DSST performance (β = −1.969, P = 0.01). In contrast, serum zinc, Ba, Cs, Mo, and other trace elements demonstrated no significant correlations with either cognitive test. Importantly, HDL-C was positively associated with DSST scores (β = 0.166, P < 0.001), suggesting a protective role in processing speed and working memory. Pearson correlation analysis revealed a significant weak positive correlation between serum copper and HDL-C (r = 0.139, P = 2.106e-06, 95% CI: 0.082–0.196; Table 4). Linear regression further confirmed this relationship: for every 1 µg/dL increase in serum copper, HDL-C levels were associated with an increase of 0.559 mg/dL (β = 0.559, P = 2.11e-06), with the model explaining 1.86% of HDL-C variance (adjusted R² = 0.0186; Table 4).

### Wilson's disease in an adult asymptomatic patient: A potential role for modifying factors of copper metabolism [^115Husvu]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

In conclusion, this case adds more information about the natural history of Wilson's disease (WD) and suggests that WD is a challenge even in particular contexts such as family screening. This is particularly true in asymptomatic patients, including the pediatric age group and in adults with asymptomatic increases in liver tests. In these patients, the presence of normal values in some of the copper metabolism tests decreases the accuracy of the Leipzig score. Thus, the use of genetic testing becomes imperative in the diagnosis of WD. Genetic testing of the entire ATP7B gene should be conducted in cases of relatives of WD patients with minimal alterations of copper metabolism in tests such as ceruloplasmin and signs such as steatosis, even in overweight patients.

### Seizures of unknown etiology associated with brittle hair: A diagnostic challenge [^113zaTwb]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

In a given patient, the constellation of hair findings — brittle, steely, and kinky hair — the LM findings of PT and TN, and low serum copper and ceruloplasmin levels are all highly suggestive of MD. However, serum copper and ceruloplasmin levels may be normal during early disease, and thus are not completely reliable in early cases such as ours. In such cases, hair and LM findings alone are highly suggestive of disease and support early treatment initiation while waiting for confirmatory molecular genetic studies.

Given that prompt treatment with copper histidine may prevent some neurologic sequelae, recognizing the hair-related clinical manifestations as indicative of MD early in the disease process is of vital importance and highlights the potentially significant role of dermatology in aiding rapid diagnosis and treatment initiation.

This case was unusual in that the patient experienced hair-related (scalp, eyebrows, eyelashes) clinical manifestations of MD earlier than is the norm. The combination of characteristic hair findings and the history of new-onset, intractable seizures was highly suggestive of MD, highlighting the importance of a multidisciplinary approach in such cases to prevent delays in the treatment of what is a rare, usually fatal, disease.

### Benefits of using exchangeable copper and the ratio of exchangeable copper in a real-world cohort of patients with Wilson disease [^114ZyFwR]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2023). High credibility.

Wilson disease (WD) is a complex condition where diagnosis and long-term metabolic copper control remain challenging. The absence of accurate biomarkers necessitates combining different parameters to ensure copper homeostasis. Exchangeable copper and its ratio (REC) have been suggested as useful biomarkers in this setting.

This study aimed to introduce these measurements and evaluate their performance and accuracy in our real-world cohort of WD patients. Exchangeable copper and REC were measured in 48 WD patients and 56 control individuals using inductively coupled plasma-mass-spectrometry. Demographic and clinical characteristics were collected. REC was found to be significantly higher among WD patients compared to controls and useful for WD identification using established cutoffs: 71.4% of recently diagnosed WD patients had REC ≥ 18.5%, and 95.1% of long-term treated WD patients had REC ≥ 14%. Only four patients in the cohort presented with discordant levels. Moreover, REC values were below 15% in all control individuals.

Exchangeable copper was significantly higher in WD patients compared to controls and tended to be reduced among WD patients who were compliant with medication. This real-life study confirmed that exchangeable copper and REC are useful serum biomarkers that can serve as complementary tests to ensure WD diagnosis (REC) and maintain copper homeostasis over time (exchangeable copper). The desirable target levels for copper homeostasis need validation in prospective cohorts.

### Present situation of biomarkers for copper status [^116Ctfqu]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2008). Low credibility.

Serum or plasma copper and ceruloplasmin concentrations are the most widely used laboratory indicators to evaluate copper status. Both indicators are decreased in moderate or severe copper deficiency. The activity of several cuproenzymes is decreased in mild copper deficiency. However, their use is limited by the nonexistence of standardized assays, high interindividual variability, and because some of these indicators are affected by other conditions.

Recently, it was shown that the protein expression of the copper chaperone for superoxide dismutase (CCS) is increased in erythrocytes of rodents with mild copper deficiency. However, no traditional laboratory indicators have been identified as potential early markers of copper excess. It is possible that the biomarkers studied so far are not sensitive enough to detect an increase in body copper before the appearance of functional or clinical effects, or that the homeostatic mechanisms are so strong that no significant changes in body copper occur with mild-to-moderate copper exposure.

The identification of appropriate biomarkers for early detection of an increase in body copper represents a major challenge for further research. The development of new approaches, such as network biology, allows us to search for and propose new candidates to be studied. Recently, we found that CCS mRNA abundance in mononuclear blood cells significantly decreased after copper supplementation. The usefulness of this indicator to detect an increase in body copper should be assessed in clinical trials.

### Neuroimaging correlates of cognitive deficits in Wilson's disease [^117Nzsc2]. Movement Disorders (2022). Low credibility.

We have previously demonstrated that increasing serum non-caeruloplasmin-bound copper levels are associated with white matter microstructural abnormalities and cortical, but not basal ganglia, atrophy in the same cohort of chronically treated patients. It has also been shown that patients with Wilson's Disease (WD), including those with hepatic presentations, have ubiquitous increases in brain copper content. It is therefore plausible that our novel neurological phenotype is driven by widespread, but mostly subclinical, copper toxicity in the brain. Dysfunction of ATP7B, which is expressed in neurons and glia, might also contribute. The classical neurological phenotype likely relates to a selective neuronal vulnerability within the basal ganglia present only in a subset of patients. We have previously suggested that a tendency to mishandle brain iron in response to copper toxicity might account for this. This overarching theory on the evolution of neurological involvement in WD is consistent with previous observations that subclinical psychiatric features and neuroimaging abnormalities are common in patients with hepatic presentations. It also explains why copper indices do not differ between patients with neurological and hepatic presentations or correlate with the severity of movement disorders.

Our findings also have implications for the binary phenotypic classification of WD. Patients are divided into neurological and hepatic presentation depending on the presence or absence of overt neurological and/or psychiatric symptoms at diagnosis. Our data suggest that more comprehensive cognitive assessment is needed to fully understand these presentations.

### Wilson's disease [^112iH7qv]. Lancet (2007). Low credibility.

Progressive hepatolenticular degeneration, or Wilson's disease, is a genetic disorder of copper metabolism. Knowledge of the clinical presentations and treatment of the disease is important both to the generalist and to specialists in gastroenterology, hepatology, neurology, psychiatry, and paediatrics. Wilson's disease invariably results in severe disability and death if untreated. The diagnosis is easily overlooked, but if discovered early, effective treatments are available that will prevent or reverse many manifestations of this disorder. Studies have identified the role of copper in disease pathogenesis, and clinical, biochemical, and genetic markers that can be useful in diagnosis. There are several chelating agents and zinc salts for medical therapy. Liver transplantation corrects the underlying pathophysiology and can be lifesaving. The discovery of the Wilson's disease gene has opened up a new molecular diagnostic approach and could form the basis of future gene therapy.

### Elevation of serum copper levels in Alzheimer's disease [^116LXH7E]. Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

To determine whether serum trace metals and oxidative species are related to abnormal cognition in Alzheimer's disease (AD), the authors studied serum peroxides, copper, iron, transferrin, and antioxidant capacity in 79 patients with AD (mean age 74.3 years; 25 men, 54 women) and in 76 cognitively normal individuals (mean age 70.1 years; 33 men, 43 women). The relationship of these oxidative and trace metals to APOE epsilon4 allele frequency, neuropsychological performance, and cerebrovascular or atrophic burden, as estimated by brain MRI and ultrasonography of cerebral vessels, was evaluated.

Copper levels were found to be higher (p < 0.001) in subjects with AD than in control subjects, with a specificity of 95% and sensitivity of 60% at a cutoff serum level of 16 micro mol/L (1.02 mg/L). An increase of 1 micro mol/L in serum copper accounted for 80% of the risk of having AD and was correlated with poor neuropsychological performance and medial temporal lobe atrophy (p < 0.03). Additionally, antioxidant capacity decreased, correlating with medial temporal lobe atrophy (p < 0.009) and the presence of the APOE epsilon4 allele (p = 0.004).

In conclusion, copper may play a role in the neurodegenerative processes in AD. Serum copper measurement may prove to be a peripheral diagnostic marker for AD.

### ACP best practice no 163. Wilson's disease: acute and presymptomatic laboratory diagnosis and monitoring [^113URtsL]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2000). Low credibility.

Wilson's disease, the most common inherited disorder of copper metabolism, is a recessive genetic condition. The clinical presentation of Wilson's disease is highly variable. It is characterized by low serum copper and caeruloplasmin concentrations, coupled with the pathological accumulation of copper in the tissues. However, there are diagnostic difficulties that are discussed in this article. The value of DNA diagnosis, both in gene tracking in families and as applied to de novo cases, is examined. Wilson's disease can be treated successfully, but treatment must be lifelong. Patients are best treated by specialist centers with experience and expertise in the condition.

### A multidisciplinary approach to the diagnosis and management of Wilson disease: Executive summary of the 2022 practice guidance on Wilson disease from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^115PLjoA]. Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for Wilson's disease, specifically in clinical and laboratory monitoring, the AASLD 2022 guidelines recommend suspecting overtreatment with pharmacological therapy directed at removal or detoxification based on the development of cytopenias or retention of tissue iron associated with raised serum ferritin. Confirm overtreatment based on low serum copper and a very low 24-hour urinary copper output.

- **Suspect overtreatment with oral chelators**: This is based on 24-hour urinary copper excretion that is disproportionately low for the dose of chelator being administered (below therapeutic target or specifically < 100 mcg/24-hour).
- **Suspect overtreatment with zinc therapy**: This occurs when 24-hour urinary copper is < 20 mcg/24-hour.

Reduce the dose of medical therapy or interrupt briefly once overtreatment is confirmed, and ensure close follow-up for reassessment.

### Designing clinical trials in Wilson's disease [^1116REez]. Hepatology (2021). Low credibility.

Determination of bioavailable copper concentration has been proposed as a possible surrogate marker. This copper fraction is considered biologically active and is the target of treatment to prevent the extrahepatic uptake of copper. There are several approaches to measure free copper.

- **Non-ceruloplasmin-bound copper (NCC)**: This is estimated by subtracting ceruloplasmin-bound copper from the total serum copper concentration. A weakness of the methodology is the presence of biologically implausible negative values in some patients (Supporting Information S.3.1). Reports on the correlation between NCC normalization and clinical outcomes are conflicting; however, a recent phase 2 study showed that the NCC estimate correlated with clinical outcomes during treatment with bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate.

- **Exchangeable copper (CuEXC)**: Measurement is obtained by the incubation of serum with EDTA to remove loosely bound copper and subsequent removal of ceruloplasmin-bound copper by ultrafiltration. The method does not depend on the measurement of ceruloplasmin. A correlation between CuEXC and organ damage was observed in an animal study. CuEXC was related to patient compliance, but longitudinal data in patients have not been reported.

For further discussion on the measurement of bioavailable copper, see Supporting Information S.3.1. At the present stage, neither NCC nor CuEXC has been validated as a surrogate endpoint. The data do not allow a conclusion as to which is more valuable for treatment monitoring. At least one of these should be included as an exploratory endpoint.

### Galzin [^115zQeMc]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Patients should be monitored primarily by assessment of existing signs and symptoms of Wilson's disease and 24-hour urine copper levels. Neuropsychiatric evaluations, including speech, as well as liver function tests, including bilirubin and aminotransferases, should be conducted as appropriate.

The urinary excretion of copper is an accurate reflection of the body's copper status when patients are not on chelation therapy. Clinicians should be aware that urinary copper levels are usually increased with chelation therapy such as penicillamine or trientine. Adequate zinc therapy will eventually decrease urinary copper excretion to 125 μg per 24 hours or less. A significant upward trend indicates an impending loss of copper control.

The non-ceruloplasmin plasma copper (also known as free copper) is obtained by subtracting the ceruloplasmin-bound copper from the total plasma copper; each mg of ceruloplasmin contains 3 μg of copper. In a United States study, the non-ceruloplasmin plasma copper concentration was kept below 20 μg/dL. Urine and plasma for copper determinations should be collected in copper-free containers and assayed with equipment capable of accurately measuring copper at levels as low as 0.01 μg/mL.

An additional monitoring tool, if available, is the amount of radioactivity measured in the plasma 1 or 2 hours after orally administered ⁶⁴copper. In adequately controlled patients, this amount is less than 1.2% of the administered dose. The level of hepatic copper should not be used to manage therapy, as it does not differentiate between potentially toxic free copper and non-toxic bound copper.

### Wilson disease [^116sZv7A]. Nature Reviews Disease Primers (2018). High credibility.

Wilson disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by impaired copper metabolism. The pathophysiology of WD involves impaired copper homeostasis due to ATP7B mutations, leading to copper overload in the liver, brain, and other organs. This copper accumulation results in cellular damage and apoptosis, leading to the clinical manifestations of the disease. The prevalence of WD worldwide is estimated at 3.3 per 100,000 population.

- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for WD include having two copies of a mutated ATP7B gene, indicating an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern.

- **Disease course**: WD manifests through a broad spectrum of hepatic and extrahepatic symptoms, reflecting systemic copper deposition. The hepatic presentation can range from asymptomatic elevations in liver enzymes to progressive liver dysfunction, encompassing hepatomegaly, jaundice, and in more advanced cases, cirrhosis. Neurological involvement includes tremors, dystonia, dysarthria, and other extrapyramidal signs, arising from copper accumulation in the basal ganglia. Kayser-Fleischer rings, appearing as a brownish-green discoloration around the corneal limbus, are a classic ophthalmologic sign in WD. Although not specific, as they can be seen in chronic cholestatic conditions, they differ from the white-yellow rings of arcus senilis or hyperlipidemia due to lipid deposition.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of WD is generally good with early diagnosis and treatment.

### Exchangeable copper for patients with Wilson disease at follow-up: Rethinking normal ranges or changing methodology [^113d9hoR]. Hepatology (2025). Low credibility.

Determining suitable copper parameters for monitoring Wilson disease remains a topic of ongoing discussion. International recommendations currently rely on the combination of urinary copper excretion and nonspecific liver markers when considering therapy and time elapsed since diagnosis. The emergence of exchangeable copper (CuEX) as a novel measurement reflecting the "free copper pool" held promise as a valuable target to ensure metabolic stability during follow-up, although the validation of target ranges remains unknown. We aimed to evaluate CuEX quantification in repeated samples from 92 real-world patients with Wilson disease during a 2-year period.

- **Approach**: Patients were classified as "stable" if a diagnosis had been made more than 1 year before and were compliant with stable anti-copper drug and dose. Otherwise, patients were classified as "nonstable".

- **Results**: Two hundred and thirteen CuEX samples were obtained per clinical practice. Overall, 57% of CuEX measurements fell below the reference "range of normality", whereas only 34% were within and 9% were above normal levels. There was no association of CuEX levels with therapy, elapsed time from diagnosis, or clinical stability, although most of the samples above normality corresponded to nonstable patients. Only 23.4% of the CuEX samples were aligned with data obtained from concomitant urinary copper excretion.

- **Conclusions**: Our findings suggest that CuEX is a suboptimal tool for assessing copper homeostasis when used alone and should be used with caution if no additional information is available.

### Performance of relative exchangeable copper for the diagnosis of Wilson disease in acute liver failure [^113y4m1Q]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2025). High credibility.

Wilson disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder caused by biallelic mutations in the ATP7B gene. It is characterized by copper accumulation, mainly in the liver and the brain, due to impaired biliary copper elimination. Diagnosis is based on a pattern of clinical signs, laboratory results, and genetic analysis.

The clinical presentation of this disease can be heterogeneous, primarily including acute or chronic liver disease and neuropsychiatric manifestations. Acute liver failure (ALF) can be the first manifestation of WD in 10% to 36.5% of cases, representing about 3% to 6% of both pediatric and adult ALF cases. This presentation is often fatal without liver transplantation; however, timely diagnosis of WD and treatment could prevent this outcome. The prognosis of WD-ALF cases can be assessed using validated scores developed to identify patients unlikely to respond to treatment and who require liver transplantation. Nonetheless, timely and appropriate treatment might avoid liver transplantation. Diagnosis of WD is also essential for family screening.

There are a few laboratory findings suggestive of WD in an ALF setting, such as Coombs-negative intravascular hemolysis, comparatively low serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and significantly low serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP). However, these findings are not systematically present, particularly in children. The utilization of the Leipzig score is standardly recommended to confirm a WD diagnosis.

### Excessive copper impairs intrahepatocyte trafficking and secretion of selenoprotein P [^111ksnQq]. Nature Communications (2023). Low credibility.

The relationship between copper and selenium serum biomarkers in humans was assessed by analyzing selenium status in serum samples of Wilson's disease patients at the time of diagnosis, before therapeutic interventions. The patient's clinical parameters were highly heterogeneous, with a broad range of serum copper concentrations observed. Based on serum ceruloplasmin (CP) levels, patients were divided into two groups: one with normal CP (> 90 μg/L) and another with low CP (< 90 μg/L) concentrations, as illustrated in Figure 4a. This division was confirmed by measuring the functional holo-CP, reflected by CP oxidase activity (Figure 4b).

Low CP is a diagnostic parameter for Wilson's disease, often indicating higher hepatic copper accumulation, as demonstrated in the rat Wilson model (Figure 3). Additionally, a third group ('diseased') included patients with elevated clinical serum parameters such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and hepatic transaminases, suggesting a more severe disease state, resulting in copper leakage from damaged hepatocytes (for patient characteristics, see Table S1).

- **Copper status characterization**: Total and free copper were analyzed to further characterize the patient's copper status. Total copper levels were reduced in the 'low CP' group compared to the 'normal CP' group (Figure 4c). Free copper levels confirmed the division into the 'diseased' group, showing higher concentrations compared to the other groups (Figure 4d). The SELENOP concentration was significantly decreased in the serum of patients with low serum copper.

### EASL-ERN clinical practice guidelines on Wilson's disease [^114riHm4]. Journal of Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism that affects the liver, brain, and other organs. Diagnosis is based on clinical features, biochemical tests (including plasma ceruloplasmin concentration, 24-hour urinary copper excretion, and copper content in the liver), and molecular analysis. The Leipzig score, in addition to relative exchangeable copper determination, are recommended for diagnosis.

Pharmacological therapy comprises chelating agents (penicillamine, trientine) and zinc salts, while only chelators are recommended for significant liver disease. Monitoring is based on clinical symptoms, liver tests, and copper metabolism (urinary copper excretion, exchangeable copper) to detect poor compliance and over/under-treatment.

Acute liver failure is challenging, as making a diagnosis is difficult and pharmacological therapy may not be sufficient to save life. Liver transplantation has a well-defined role in Wilsonian acute hepatic failure but may also be considered in neurological disease.

### Investigating the prevalence of copper and zinc abnormalities in patients pre and post bariatric surgery-an Australian experience [^116wHnTj]. Obesity Surgery (2023). Low credibility.

The American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery (ASMBS) guidelines recommend the routine screening of copper (Cu) through serum Cu and ceruloplasmin for patients prior to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and biliopancreatic diversion (BPD) procedures. However, the British Obesity and Metabolic Surgery Society (BOMSS) did not identify strong evidence to support routine screening of Cu levels.

In our study, preoperatively, low Cu levels were observed in only 1 (0.7%) patient. This finding is consistent with a study by Papamargaritis et al, which showed a minimal level of Cu abnormality (2%); however, it contrasts with other findings where Cu deficiency was reported to be between 63.8% and as high as 74%. This discrepancy may represent the different availability of micronutrients in diets across various countries and potentially among different communities within countries.

On the other hand, elevated Cu levels were more common in this study, present in 23 (16.7%) patients. When interpreting Cu levels, it is important to note that inflammation affects both serum copper and ceruloplasmin levels; hence, the results need to be interpreted with caution. Copper is a positive acute-phase reactant, and as C-reactive protein (CRP) was elevated in 52 (47.7%) cases, elevated Cu levels in this cohort are expected. As observed in this study, CRP levels improved following surgery, and consequently, so did Cu levels.

Reports on the prevalence of Cu deficiency following surgery remain inconsistent. However, several studies have reported that Cu deficiency, if untreated, can lead to serious and irreversible neurological complications. Therefore, monitoring the Cu status of bariatric patients is imperative.

### The overuse of serum ceruloplasmin measurement [^111SUkaP]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Wilson disease is rare, found in 3 of 100,000 people (0.03%). Ceruloplasmin is often ordered to evaluate liver enzyme elevations. Because Wilson disease often presents before middle age, the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease recommends screening patients between the ages of 3 and 55 years with liver abnormalities of uncertain cause.

We evaluate guideline adherence and the clinical and economic impact of the clinical use of ceruloplasmin. We reviewed all ceruloplasmin measurements at a clinical laboratory serving a large primary care network, specialty clinics, and a 600-bed tertiary referral center between January 1, 2003, and December 12, 2011.

Ceruloplasmin was measured 5,325 times in 5,023 unique patients, resulting in 8 (0.16%) new Wilson disease diagnoses. Ceruloplasmin's positive predictive value was 8.4% (95% confidence interval, 7.7–9.3) and the false-positive rate was 98.1% (95% confidence interval, 96.2–99.1). A total of 1,109 ceruloplasmin levels (20.8%) were ordered in the 1,066 patients aged more than 55 years (none with Wilson disease). A "shotgun" approach to liver disease diagnosis was found: ceruloplasmin was ordered on the same day as hepatitis B (81.0%), hepatitis C (76.0%), autoimmune hepatitis (75.1%), and hemochromatosis (73.1%). Of 424 positive ceruloplasmin results, 91% were not pursued further.

Guideline adherence restricts ceruloplasmin use to a population with a higher pre-test probability of Wilson disease: patients with chronic liver disease aged 3 to 55 years.

### Prospective evaluation of the diagnostic accuracy of hepatic copper content, as determined using the entire core of a liver biopsy sample [^116r55Lt]. Hepatology (2015).

Ferenci et al.'s and Nicastro et al.'s studies suggest that, unlike urinary copper excretion, which is age-related, liver copper concentration does not seem to be influenced by patient age. One unexpected finding of this study was that hepatic copper content was actually negatively correlated with the age of patients with Wilson's Disease (WD) at the time of diagnosis. Specifically, mean hepatic copper content in patients 14 years old or younger was significantly higher than in older patients; all patients 10 years old or younger had hepatic copper levels much greater than 250 μg/g dry weight. This finding contradicts the conventional belief that copper continuously accumulates over time in untreated patients with WD.

We have three potential explanations for this finding:

- **Liver copper accumulation versus urinary excretion**: Liver copper accumulation always precedes the increase of urinary copper excretion for a considerable time. Meanwhile, liver copper levels are calculated per gram of liver tissue, but urinary copper excretion is calculated according to the total urinary excretion per 24 hours, which is directly correlated with patient age.

- **Mutations leading to rapid accumulation**: Early-onset patients may have more serious mutations of the WD gene, which may lead to more rapid accumulation of copper in the liver.

- **Age-dependent changes similar to animal models**: Patients with WD may have similar age-dependent changes in hepatic copper concentrations as seen in animal models of WD. In rodent models of WD, copper concentration increased dramatically in the liver with a plateau in the first few months of life, did not change significantly for the next few months, and subsequently…

### Insights into the management of Wilson's disease [^114bpFvA]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Wilson's disease is a rare, inherited autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism. The causative gene, ATP7B, results in absent or reduced function of the ATP7B transporter, which is crucial for biliary excretion of copper and the incorporation of copper into caeruloplasmin. Affected patients accumulate excessive copper within the liver, brain, and other tissues. Primarily a disease of children, adolescents, and young adults, clinical features range from an asymptomatic state to chronic liver disease, acute liver failure, and neuropsychiatric manifestations.

Diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion and is based on a combination of clinical signs, biochemical tests, hepatic copper content assay, and mutation analysis of the ATP7B gene. There are more than 500 mutations of ATP7B identified in patients with Wilson's disease. Early recognition and treatment can lead to an excellent prognosis, whereas untreated disease is almost always fatal.

- **Drug therapies**: Chelating agents such as penicillamine or trientine, and zinc salts are utilized.

- **Liver transplantation**: This is curative, correcting the underlying pathophysiology, and is traditionally indicated in cases of acute liver failure or end-stage liver disease refractory to medical therapy.

This review provides an overview of various aspects of Wilson's disease, including the molecular basis of the disease, clinical features, diagnostic and management strategies, along with their limitations.

### Serum iron, zinc, and copper levels in patients with Alzheimer's disease: A replication study and meta-analyses [^113PHPUi]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2015). Low credibility.

To evaluate whether iron, zinc, and copper levels in serum are disarranged in Alzheimer's disease (AD), we performed meta-analyses of all studies on the topic published from 1984 to 2014 and contextually carried out a replication study in serum as well. Our meta-analysis results showed that serum zinc was significantly lower in AD patients. Our replication and meta-analysis results showed that serum copper was significantly higher in AD patients than in healthy controls, so our findings were consistent with the conclusions of four previously published copper meta-analyses. Even if a possible role of iron in the pathophysiology of the disease could not be ruled out, the results of our meta-analysis showed no change of serum iron levels in AD patients, but this conclusion was not robust and requires further investigation.

The meta-regression analyses revealed that in some studies, differences in serum iron levels could be due to the different mean ages, while differences in zinc levels appeared to be due to the different sex ratios. However, the effect of sex ratio on serum zinc levels in our meta-analysis is subtle and needs further confirmation. Also, diverse demographic terms and methodological approaches appeared not to explain the high heterogeneity of our copper meta-analysis. Therefore, when investigating trace elements, covariants such as age and sex have to be taken into account in the analyses. In light of these findings, we suggest that the possible alteration of serum zinc and copper levels are involved in the pathogenesis of AD.

### Key biomarkers in type 2 diabetes patients: A systematic review [^1179Kyh4]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Ceruloplasmin is the major copper-carrying protein, responsible for transporting approximately 95% of copper in the blood. It exhibits ferroxidase activity, catalyzing the oxidation of ferrous iron into ferric iron. This activity assists the transportation of iron by transferrin in the bloodstream. Ceruloplasmin acts as an acute-phase reactant, produced by hepatocytes when induced by cytokines released from activated monocytes and macrophages. The level of ceruloplasmin was significantly higher among T2DM patients compared to controls (1222.82 ± 306.15 IU/L vs. 868.38 ± 198.80 IU/L, p < 0.01) in diabetes. Elevated levels of ceruloplasmin have been reported as markers of abnormally high oxidative stress in T2DM. Diabetic retinopathy, a common microvascular complication that can cause blindness, has been associated with high levels of ceruloplasmin in T2DM patients (p < 0.01). Increased ceruloplasmin blood levels (4.9 ± 1.3 mg/g) are also noted in other T2DM studies. IFN-γ and TNF-α induce the synthesis of ceruloplasmin by human myeloid cells.

Haptoglobin binds to free hemoglobin, forming a high-affinity complex that is eliminated from circulation by the reticuloendothelial system, including CD163-positive macrophages and hepatocytes. The removal time of this complex is approximately 20 minutes. Haptoglobin functions as a clearance protein and antioxidant, reducing the oxidative activity of heme iron. Due to its antioxidant properties, haptoglobin plays a role in innate immune mechanisms, restricts the accessibility of iron to pathogens, and stimulates tissue repair in inflammation.

### Investigation and management of Wilson's disease: A practical guide from the British Association for the Study of the Liver [^116ohh8D]. The Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2022). Low credibility.

Wilson's disease is an autosomal-recessive disorder of copper metabolism with hepatic, neurological, psychiatric, ophthalmological, haematological, renal, and rheumatological manifestations. Making a diagnosis can be challenging given that no single test can confirm or exclude the disease, and diagnostic delays are common. Treatment protocols vary and adverse effects, including paradoxical neurological worsening, can occur.

In this review, we provide a practical guide to the diagnosis of Wilson's disease. We include recommendations on indications for testing, how to interpret results, and when additional investigations are required. We also cover treatment initiation, ideally under the guidance of a specialist centre for Wilson's disease, and the principles behind long-term management. This guidance was developed by a multidisciplinary group of Wilson's disease experts formed through the British Association for the Study of the Liver. The guidance has been endorsed by the British Society of Gastroenterology and approved by the Association of British Neurologists.

### Prospective evaluation of the diagnostic accuracy of hepatic copper content, as determined using the entire core of a liver biopsy sample [^116dsscJ]. Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

Wilson's disease (WD), first described by Kinnear Wilson in 1912, is an autosomal-recessive inherited disorder of copper metabolism resulting in copper accumulation in the liver and other organs. As early as 1948, Cumings found elevated copper levels in both the liver and brain tissue of patients with WD and first discussed an etiological role for copper. Some other physicians and investigators, both before and after Cumings, have made similar observations.

In the 1960s, Sternlieb et al. and Smallwood et al. found that hepatic copper concentrations are between 15 and 55 μg/g dry liver in normal individuals and are elevated in virtually all untreated patients with WD to values between 250 and 3,000 μg/g dry tissue. Then, Brewer stated that a liver copper value below diagnostic levels had not been found in their patients with WD. Therefore, a hepatic copper level of 250 μg/g dry tissue or more has been considered most valid for diagnosing WD. However, the diagnostic accuracy of the test has never been prospectively investigated or validated in a sufficiently large group of patients with and without WD.

Liver copper data in most studies have been collected over several decades from hospital records, and most information was from a small number of patients with limited pathological conditions. Furthermore, nondiagnostic hepatic copper levels in patients with confirmed WD have been reported by many researchers in the past two to three decades, including 3 of 12 patients with WD reported by Martins da Costa et al. and 4 of 43 reported by Steind.

### Copper: caeruloplasmin ratio [^115jXupA]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2007). Low credibility.

Investigation of copper status can be a diagnostic challenge. The non-caeruloplasmin-bound copper (NCC) has deficiencies; accordingly, the copper: caeruloplasmin ratio has been suggested as an alternative index of copper status. A reference interval for this index was derived. In addition to simplifying the interpretation of copper, the copper: caeruloplasmin ratio should also enable adjustment for relatively high caeruloplasmin concentrations without resorting to producing gender- and age-derived intervals. However, the copper: caeruloplasmin ratio has weaknesses similar to those identified for NCC, as immunological methods used for measuring caeruloplasmin can cross-react with apocaeruloplasmin and there is no standardized method for caeruloplasmin. Caeruloplasmin assays also face uncertainty from precision, bias, and specificity; accordingly, method-related differences may have a significant effect on the copper: caeruloplasmin ratio, similar to NCC.

### Resolution of decompensated cirrhosis from Wilson's disease with zinc monotherapy: A potential therapeutic option [^116Qy2M2]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2006). Low credibility.

Wilson's disease is a genetic autosomal-recessive copper deposition disorder often presenting with neurologic or hepatic symptoms. In cases of hepatic presentation, treatment typically begins with potentially toxic copper chelators, such as D-penicillamine or trientine. Although multiple studies have introduced zinc as a low-toxicity and low-cost treatment for Wilson's disease, its use has been limited to adjunctive or single-agent maintenance options. In this report, we describe zinc monotherapy use in a patient with a severe hepatic presentation of Wilson's disease.

- **Methods**: Zinc has not been evaluated as a single-agent treatment option for active hepatic Wilson's disease. Zinc monotherapy was initiated for a single patient with fulminant hepatic failure caused by Wilson's disease while awaiting liver transplantation.

- **Results**: Over a 1-year period of zinc monotherapy, this patient experienced normalization of hepatic synthetic function and resolution of hypoalbuminemia and coagulopathy. Clinical stabilization of variceal bleeds, ascites, and lower-extremity edema was also observed. The patient is no longer a transplant candidate due to clinical recovery and improvement of Model for End-stage Liver Disease and Child-Turcotte-Pugh scores.

- **Conclusions**: This case highlights the potential use of zinc as a low-toxicity and low-cost single-agent treatment in severely decompensated hepatic Wilson's disease. Despite promising results in this case, further clinical evaluation will be necessary to assess fully the clinical efficacy of zinc monotherapy.

### Biomarkers for diagnosis of Wilson's disease [^114WpeTG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). High credibility.

Wilson's disease, first described by Samuel Wilson in 1912, is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder resulting from mutations in the ATP7B gene. The disease develops as a consequence of copper accumulating in affected tissues. There is no gold standard for the diagnosis of Wilson's disease, which is often delayed due to the non-specific clinical features and the need for a combination of clinical and laboratory tests for diagnosis. This delay may, in turn, affect clinical outcomes and has implications for other family members in terms of diagnosis. The Leipzig criteria were established to help standardize diagnosis and management. However, it should be emphasized that these criteria date from 2003 and many of them have not been formally evaluated. This review examines the evidence behind biochemical testing for Wilson's disease.

- **Objectives**: To determine the diagnostic accuracy of three biochemical tests at specified cut-off levels for Wilson's disease. The index tests covered by this Cochrane Review are caeruloplasmin, 24-hour urinary copper, and hepatic copper content. These tests were evaluated in those with suspected Wilson's disease and appropriate controls (either healthy or those with chronic liver diseases other than Wilson's). In the absence of a gold standard for diagnosing Wilson's disease, the Leipzig criteria have been used as a clinical reference standard. The review also investigates whether index tests should be performed in all individuals recommended for testing for Wilson's disease or if these tests should be limited to subgroups of individuals.

### Copper deficiency in children with intestinal failure: Risk factors and influence on hematological cytopenias [^1131oJQV]. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2021). Low credibility.

We investigated to what extent serum copper influences hemoglobin (Hb), neutrophil, and platelet counts, as well as the factors associated with serum copper in children with intestinal failure (IF) who have their micronutrient status monitored according to a standard protocol.

- **Methods**: Children with IF admitted to a pediatric intestinal rehabilitation program and receiving home parenteral nutrition (PN) were followed up prospectively. Patients received vitamins and multi-trace elements (TEs) as part of the PN. Copper, iron, zinc, vitamin A, and cobalamin serum levels were routinely monitored at 3-month intervals or monthly when a deficiency was detected. Complete blood counts were performed biweekly. Repeated-measures analyses were used to estimate the effect of explanatory variables on the outcomes.

- **Results**: Thirteen children with a median time receiving PN of 16.6 months were included. An average of 7 copper measurements per patient were performed; 53.8% of patients had a low serum level at least twice during the follow-up. Eight patients with cholestasis had TEs of PN discontinued. In the multivariable analysis, copper was not associated with Hb levels; an increase of 10 µg/dL in serum copper resulted in an increase of 240/mm³ (95% confidence interval, 18.0–30.1) neutrophils and of 8429/mm³ (95% CI, 466–1219) platelets (P < .001). Time of PN without copper, direct bilirubin levels, and ostomy were associated with lower serum copper.

- **Conclusion**: The increase in serum copper was associated with significant increases in neutrophil and platelet counts.

### Is there a link between premature ovarian failure and serum concentrations of vitamin D, zinc, and copper [^111ozwgr]. Menopause (2013). Low credibility.

The risk of primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) increases in association with autoimmune conditions. Adequate intake of vitamin D (vit D) and trace elements is required for the immune system to function efficiently. The aim of this study was to evaluate vit D, zinc, and copper blood levels in women with POI who had given birth to at least one child and in women with normal menstrual cycles.

- **Methods**: This was a cross-sectional, case-control study involving 63 participants divided into two groups: the study group, composed of 35 women with POI, and the control group, composed of 28 women with normal menstrual cycles. Serum concentrations of zinc, vit D, and copper were determined for each participant.

- **Results**: Women with POI had significantly higher serum copper levels and copper-to-zinc ratio but significantly lower serum vit D and zinc levels compared with the healthy control group. Serum follicle-stimulating hormone levels were inversely correlated with zinc and vit D levels and positively correlated with the copper-to-zinc ratio and copper levels. Vit D levels were inversely correlated with follicle-stimulating hormone levels, copper-to-zinc ratio, and copper levels and positively correlated with zinc levels.

- **Conclusions**: Most women with POI are deficient in vit D. Zinc, copper, and vit D seem to correlate with hormonal status in the participants. The present study may generate hypotheses for future studies that will investigate the possible mechanisms behind alterations in trace elements and vit D deficiency in women with POI.

### Performance of relative exchangeable copper for the diagnosis of Wilson disease in acute liver failure [^117GNm7C]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2025). Low credibility.

Common findings usually associated with the diagnosis of Wilson disease, such as the presence of the Kayser–Fleischer ring, low ceruloplasmin, high urinary copper excretion, or high copper liver content, can be absent, not readily available, unachievable, or less specific in an acute liver failure setting.

For instance, the detection rate of the Kayser–Fleischer ring is dependent on age at presentation, with rates reaching up to 85% and can also be found in other hepatic diseases.

In the present study, ceruloplasmin levels of 2.6 μmol/24 h or > 3.8 μmol/24 h were needed to obtain sensitivities of 70% and 91.7%, respectively, and a specificity was noted but not provided in full.

### Performance of relative exchangeable copper for the diagnosis of Wilson disease in acute liver failure [^113KZD3Z]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2025). Low credibility.

The calculated NCC has been historically used to monitor the evolution of WD patients, but its use for diagnosis has never been validated. A cutoff of > 25 μg/dL has been proposed as most untreated WD patients have these values, but this can also occur in many other circumstances, such as liver failure of any etiology, thereby limiting its diagnostic value. Our results illustrate this problem, given the inadequate performance this method showed in diagnosing WD in an ALF scenario.

- **Exchangeable copper and its ratio**: The exchangeable copper and its ratio referred to as serum copper, known as relative exchangeable copper (REC), have proven value in multiple situations related to WD. The first studies demonstrated the utility of REC for the diagnosis of WD, where values > 14% or > 18% had 100% sensitivity and specificity. A more recent study from a different team evidenced that the cutoff of > 14% allowed for 100% specificity and a sensitivity of 93.8%. Our findings indicate that the best REC cutoff is > 14.4%, which aligns with previous studies.

- **Comparison of REC values**: We have previously published a study comparing the REC values of two WD cohorts (recently diagnosed or non-stabilized and well-controlled patients) with two groups (adults and children) of other liver diseases. As mentioned, this study showed that a REC value > 14% has excellent performance for the diagnosis of WD, but both groups, WD and non-WD, included either chronic patients or patients who were not in a situation of ALF. Our study is the first to evaluate this performance in an ALF setting, and it shows comparable results to previous findings.

### A multidisciplinary approach to the diagnosis and management of Wilson disease: Executive summary of the 2022 practice guidance on Wilson disease from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^113ZpQ3Y]. Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Wilson's disease, specifically concerning serum ceruloplasmin and urinary copper excretion, the AASLD 2022 guidelines recommend recognizing that an extremely low serum ceruloplasmin level (< 5 mg/dL) more strongly suggests a diagnosis of Wilson's disease than modestly subnormal levels. However, serum ceruloplasmin by itself is insufficient for making a diagnosis. Do not exclude Wilson's disease based on normal serum ceruloplasmin levels.
