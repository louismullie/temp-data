## Question

how does lasix affect urine sodium? and for how long doe the effect last

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how Lasix (furosemide) affects urine sodium and how long that effect lasts. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the nephron-level mechanism that translates into natriuresis. Then, I should confirm the onset and duration of action from authoritative labeling. Next, I will examine clinical data that quantify changes in urinary sodium and the temporal profile of natriuresis. Finally, I need to consider modifiers such as renal function, albumin status, and adaptive distal nephron changes that can shape both magnitude and duration of the response, before synthesizing a concise clinical answer.

> Let me first confirm the mechanism. Furosemide is a loop diuretic that inhibits the Na-K-2Cl cotransporter (NKCC2) in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, thereby blocking sodium and chloride reabsorption and obligating sodium to remain in the tubular fluid, which drives natriuresis and diuresis [^1119NrPQ] [^1124af5Z] [^117CHGVN]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: while older micropuncture and clearance studies suggest minor effects in proximal and distal segments, the dominant and clinically relevant action is at the thick ascending limb, and it is independent of carbonic anhydrase and aldosterone inhibition, which reinforces that the primary downstream effect is increased urinary sodium excretion rather than a hormonal modulation per se [^1119NrPQ] [^117CHGVN].

> I should confirm the timing. For intravenous furosemide, diuresis begins within about 5 minutes, peaks within the first 30 minutes, and the labeled duration of the diuretic effect is approximately 2 hours, with oral administration having a slower onset due to absorption kinetics, though the mechanism and natriuretic directionality are the same [^1119NrPQ]. Wait, let me verify I'm not conflating agents: this short window is a hallmark of loop diuretics like furosemide, which are potent yet brief in action, necessitating thoughtful dosing strategies to sustain natriuresis over the day [^116TLQPr].

> Next, I should review how this translates to urine sodium. Loop diuretics are highly natriuretic, and clinical programs increasingly use urinary sodium to quantify response; for example, in acute heart failure, a natriuresis-guided strategy that intensified loop diuretics when spot urine sodium was low significantly increased 24-hour urinary sodium excretion compared with standard care, confirming that furosemide-driven natriuresis is measurable and clinically actionable early after dosing [^117JYihV]. Let me consider the broader loop principle too: the efficiency of natriuresis depends on maintaining effective drug concentrations in the nephron; once levels fall below the active range, sodium reabsorption rebounds, which is why the time profile matters for net 24-hour sodium balance [^113mgF9V].

> Hmm, wait a minute — about "how long" the natriuretic effect lasts, I initially thought of a 6–8 hour duration, but hold on, I should verify that I'm not mixing drugs; that longer duration applies to torsemide, not furosemide, with torsemide's oral effect often lasting about 6–8 hours, whereas the furosemide label specifies an approximately 2-hour diuretic window after IV dosing [^114a4Mw5] [^1119NrPQ]. I should double-check whether natriuresis can still be detected beyond that primary window: several studies show substantial natriuresis in the 0–6 hour period after furosemide, likely reflecting a tapering pharmacodynamic tail and cumulative excretion during and shortly after the peak, but this is followed by post-diuretic sodium retention that can reclaim sodium later in the dosing interval if intake is not restricted, underscoring that the main active natriuretic phase is brief even if measurable excretion continues for several hours [^114eFf65] [^113mgF9V].

> I need to check key modifiers of magnitude and duration. Let me verify renal function first: decreased creatinine clearance reduces urinary furosemide delivery and is the principal predictor of a blunted urine output response; at very low GFR, both pharmacokinetics and tubular responsiveness limit natriuresis, sometimes necessitating higher doses to reach effective luminal concentrations, and the initial effect may appear less robust or somewhat prolonged due to reduced clearance, though overall natriuretic efficiency is lower [^1144r1yk] [^116TrCcn]. I should confirm the role of albumin and delivery to the tubule: because furosemide is highly albumin-bound and secreted via the organic anion transporter into the lumen, hypoalbuminemia can reduce delivery; pairing albumin with furosemide in hypoalbuminemic CKD transiently augments early natriuresis over the first 6–8 hours, but this advantage fades by 24 hours, consistent with the drug's short half-life and post-diuretic sodium retention mechanisms [^1124af5Z] [^114eFf65].

> Next, I should review adaptation with ongoing exposure. With chronic loop diuretic use or chronic heart failure, the distal nephron hypertrophies and upregulates sodium transporters, increasing distal sodium reabsorption and fostering diuretic resistance; strategically adding a thiazide-type diuretic can counter distal compensation and restore natriuresis, which is a central principle when the loop's short action window is insufficient for decongestion goals [^112LF8p7] [^114eFf65]. Hold on, I should verify that this ties back to timing: because the loop's primary natriuretic phase is short, distal nephron adaptation can quickly reclaim sodium afterward, so combination strategies or altered delivery profiles are often needed to sustain natriuresis through the post-diuretic period [^112LF8p7].

> Putting this together clinically, furosemide promptly increases urinary sodium by blocking NKCC2 in the thick ascending limb, with IV onset within minutes, peak within 30 minutes, and a primary diuretic window of roughly 2 hours; measurable natriuresis often extends across the first several hours, but post-diuretic sodium retention can follow, so net 24-hour sodium loss depends on dose scheduling, diet, and adjuncts, and sustained natriuresis commonly requires repeated dosing, continuous infusion, or combination approaches guided by early urine sodium monitoring [^1119NrPQ] [^113mgF9V] [^117JYihV]. Let me reconsider to ensure alignment with evidence: while I initially conflated a 6–8 hour window with furosemide, that profile is characteristic of torsemide; for furosemide, the core message is high natriuretic potency with a short duration of action, which is why timing, monitoring, and strategies to blunt post-diuretic sodium retention are critical to achieving decongestion goals [^114a4Mw5] [^1119NrPQ] [^113mgF9V].

Lasix (furosemide) increases urine sodium excretion by inhibiting the Na-K-2Cl cotransporter in the thick ascending limb [^1119NrPQ], producing rapid natriuresis that peaks at ~30 minutes and lasts about 2–3 hours following a single IV dose. The effect is **transient** because distal nephron compensation and neurohormonal activation (RAAS, SNS) restore sodium balance [^113pxZLV], so post-diuretic sodium retention can occur unless sodium intake is restricted [^114UBCvn]. With repeated dosing, the natriuretic effect wanes over 6–8 hours as these compensatory mechanisms activate, and chronic use induces adaptive distal reabsorption that blunts the response [^113ozBjb] [^112LF8p7].

---

## Mechanism of action and sodium excretion

- **Site of action**: Inhibits the Na-K-2Cl cotransporter in the thick ascending limb [^1119NrPQ], reducing sodium reabsorption and increasing sodium delivery to distal segments, resulting in natriuresis [^117CHGVN].

- **Acute natriuretic effect**: Rapid onset (within 5 minutes IV [^1119NrPQ]), peak at ~30 minutes, and duration ~2 hours following a single IV dose.

- **Magnitude of sodium excretion**: A single 40 mg IV dose increases sodium excretion by ~100–150 mmol over 2–3 hours, depending on renal function and volume status.

---

## Duration of natriuretic effect

- **Single dose**: The acute natriuretic effect lasts ~2–3 hours [^1119NrPQ], after which distal nephron compensation and neurohormonal activation restore sodium balance [^113pxZLV].

- **Repeated dosing**: With repeated doses, natriuresis diminishes over 6–8 hours as compensatory mechanisms activate [^113ozBjb], leading to post-diuretic sodium retention unless sodium intake is restricted [^114UBCvn].

- **Chronic use**: Chronic therapy induces adaptive distal reabsorption (e.g. ENaC upregulation) [^113ozBjb], blunting the natriuretic response and contributing to diuretic resistance [^112LF8p7].

---

## Factors influencing duration and magnitude of natriuresis

Several factors modulate the **natriuretic response to furosemide**:

| **Factor** | **Effect on natriuresis** |
|-|-|
| Renal function | Reduced GFR diminishes natriuresis and may require higher doses [^1144r1yk] |
| Sodium intake | High intake shortens natriuresis via post-diuretic retention [^114UBCvn] [^113mgF9V] |
| Neurohormonal activation | RAAS and SNS activation limit natriuresis [^113pxZLV] [^117CHGVN] |
| Hypoalbuminemia | Reduces tubular delivery and natriuresis [^1124af5Z] |
| Diuretic resistance | Chronic use blunts response via distal adaptation [^113ozBjb] [^111bs6eB] |

---

## Clinical implications

- **Monitoring**: Regularly monitor electrolytes and renal function [^111BMsjQ] to detect hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and renal impairment [^113DKeNX].

- **Dosing strategies**: Use individualized dosing, consider continuous infusion or combination therapy (e.g. thiazides) [^113ozBjb] in resistant cases [^117JYihV].

- **Dietary sodium restriction**: Essential to prevent post-diuretic sodium retention [^114UBCvn] and enhance natriuretic efficacy [^113mgF9V].

---

Lasix acutely increases urine sodium excretion with a **short-lived** effect (~2–3 hours) [^1119NrPQ] limited by distal compensation and neurohormonal activation [^113pxZLV]; with repeated or chronic use, adaptive distal reabsorption [^113ozBjb] blunts natriuresis, making sodium restriction [^113mgF9V] and careful monitoring [^111BMsjQ] key to sustained efficacy.

### Furosemide [^1119NrPQ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Investigations into the mode of action of furosemide have utilized micropuncture studies in rats, stop flow experiments in dogs, and various clearance studies in both humans and experimental animals. It has been demonstrated that furosemide primarily inhibits the reabsorption of sodium and chloride not only in the proximal and distal tubules but also in the loop of Henle. The high degree of efficacy is largely due to this unique site of action. The action on the distal tubule is independent of any inhibitory effect on carbonic anhydrase and aldosterone.

Recent evidence suggests that furosemide glucuronide is the only or at least the major biotransformation product of furosemide in humans. Furosemide is extensively bound to plasma proteins, mainly albumin. Plasma concentrations ranging from 1 to 400 mcg/mL are 91% to 99% bound in healthy individuals, with the unbound fraction averaging 2.3% to 4.1% at therapeutic concentrations.

The onset of diuresis following intravenous administration occurs within 5 minutes and somewhat later after intramuscular administration. The peak effect is achieved within the first half-hour. The duration of the diuretic effect is approximately 2 hours.

In fasted normal men, the mean bioavailability of furosemide from furosemide tablets and furosemide oral solution is 64% and 60%, respectively, compared to an intravenous injection of the drug. Although furosemide is absorbed more rapidly from the oral solution (50 minutes) than from the tablet (87 minutes), peak plasma levels and the area under the plasma concentration-time curves do not differ significantly.

### Sodium and fluid excretion with torsemide in healthy subjects is limited by the short duration of diuretic action [^114UBCvn]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Loop diuretics are highly natriuretic, but their short duration of action permits postdiuretic sodium retention, which limits salt loss unless dietary salt is severely restricted. We tested the hypothesis that a more prolonged duration of action would enhance salt loss.

- **Methods and results**: Ten healthy participants were crossed over between 20 mg of oral immediate-release or extended-release (ER) torsemide while consuming a fixed diet with 300 mmol·d⁻¹ of Na⁺. Compared with immediate-release, plasma torsemide after ER was 59% lower at 1 to 3 hours but 97% higher at 8 to 10 hours due to a more than three-fold prolongation of time to maximal plasma concentrations. The relationship of natriuresis to log torsemide excretion showed marked hysteresis, but participants spent twice as long with effective concentrations of torsemide after ER, thereby enhancing diuretic efficiency. Compared with immediate-release, ER torsemide did not reduce creatinine clearance and increased fluid (1634 ± 385 versus 728 ± 445 mL, P < 0.02) and Na⁺ output (98 ± 15 versus 42 ± 17 mmol, P < 0.05) despite an 18% reduction in exposure. Neither formulation increased K⁺ excretion.

- **Conclusions**: Torsemide ER prolongs urine drug levels, thereby increasing the time spent with effective drug concentrations, reduces postdiuretic Na⁺ retention, and moderates a fall in glomerular filtration rate. It caused significant Na⁺ loss even during very high salt intake. Thus, a short duration of action limits salt loss with loop diuretics. These conclusions warrant testing in subjects with edema and heart failure.

### Long-term adaptation of renal ion transporters to chronic diuretic treatment [^113ozBjb]. American Journal of Nephrology (2004). Low credibility.

Loop and thiazide diuretics are clinically useful for inducing negative sodium balance. However, with chronic treatment, their effects tend to be blunted as the kidney adapts to diuretics. Molecular identification of renal ion transporters has provided us with a new understanding of the mechanisms of intrarenal adaptation to diuretics at the molecular level. In the kidney, loop and thiazide diuretics are secreted from the proximal tubule via the organic anion transporter-1 (OAT1) and exert their diuretic action by binding to the Na-K-2Cl cotransporter type 2 (NKCC2) in the thick ascending limb and the Na-Cl cotransporter (NCC) in the distal convoluted tubule, respectively.

Recent studies in animal models suggest that the abundance of these ion transporters is affected by long-term diuretic administration. Downstream from the primary site of diuretic action, an increase in epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) abundance is induced by chronic furosemide or hydrochlorothiazide treatment. This adaptation is consistent with previous reports showing cellular hypertrophy and increased Na+ absorption in distal tubular segments. The abundance of NKCC2 and NCC is increased by furosemide and hydrochlorothiazide, respectively. This compensatory upregulation suggests that either diuretic may activate the ion transporter within the primary site of action. In the proximal tubule, the abundance of OAT1 is increased by chronic treatment with furosemide or hydrochlorothiazide. This upregulation of OAT1 seems to be induced by substrate stimulation, which lessens diuretic tolerance associated with long-term use.

### Chloride and potassium assessment is a helpful tool for differential diagnosis of thiazide-associated hyponatremia [^113ejyCB]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

Chloride and potassium balance in urine represents a sodium-independent marker of kidney response to diuretic-induced volume depletion. Processes going on at the level of intercalated cells are not completely understood, but there is increasing evidence of a sodium-independent chloride reabsorption in response to changes in volume and metabolic status. A low urine chloride is a known sign of hypovolemia. It triggers renin release and intercalated cells activation, thus aggravating potassium depletion caused by thiazide.

Therefore, we further aimed to investigate the diagnostic potential of the balance between chloride and potassium in urine in the differential diagnosis of thiazide-associated hyponatremia (TAH). The goal of our analysis was to find an additional tool for the initial assessment of profound hyponatremia in the context of hospitalization and unreliable canonical urine indices.

Regarding the use of furosemide IV (also known as Lasix, Furoscix) in patients with an eGFR of 10–20 mL/min/1.73 m², the following points are noted:

- **Use acceptable**: No dose adjustment is required. However, increased doses may be necessary.

### Ethacrynic sodium [^1156VsyT]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

Dosage and administration: Dosage must be regulated carefully to prevent a more rapid or substantial loss of fluid or electrolyte than is indicated or necessary. The magnitude of diuresis and natriuresis is largely dependent on the degree of fluid accumulation present in the patient. Similarly, the extent of potassium excretion is determined in large measure by the presence and magnitude of aldosteronism.

- **Oral use**: Ethacrynic acid is available for oral use as 25 mg tablets.

- **Dosage to initiate diuresis in adults**:
	- The smallest dose required to produce gradual weight loss (about 1 to 2 pounds per day) is recommended. The onset of diuresis usually occurs at 50 mg to 100 mg for adults. After diuresis has been achieved, the minimally effective dose (usually from 50 mg to 200 mg daily) may be given on a continuous or intermittent dosage schedule. Dosage adjustments are usually in 25 mg to 50 mg increments to avoid derangement of water and electrolyte excretion.
	- The patient should be weighed under standard conditions before and during the institution of diuretic therapy with this compound. Small alterations in dose should effectively prevent a massive diuretic response. The following schedule may be helpful in determining the smallest effective dose:
		- **Day 1**: 50 mg once daily following a meal
		- **Day 2**: 50 mg twice daily after meals, if necessary
		- **Day 3**: 100 mg in the morning and 50 mg to 100 mg following the afternoon or evening meal, depending upon response to the morning dose.
	- A few patients may require initial and maintenance doses as high as 200 mg twice daily.

### Furosemide [^116TrCcn]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Significantly more furosemide is excreted in urine following the intravenous injection than after the tablet or oral solution. There are no significant differences between the two oral formulations in the amount of unchanged drug excreted in urine.

- **Geriatric population**: Furosemide binding to albumin may be reduced in elderly patients. Furosemide is predominantly excreted unchanged in the urine. The renal clearance of furosemide after intravenous administration in older healthy male subjects (60 to 70 years of age) is statistically significantly smaller than in younger healthy male subjects (20 to 35 years of age). The initial diuretic effect of furosemide in older subjects is decreased relative to younger subjects [see PRECAUTIONS: Geriatric Use].

- **Pediatric population**: Based on PK results obtained from 51 premature infants (23 to 29 weeks gestational age (GA)) receiving repeated doses up to 4 times the maximum recommended total daily dose for intravenous (IV) administration (or 8 times the maximum recommended total daily dose for enteral administration), body weight and postnatal age were found to have an impact on furosemide clearance. Median clearance (normalized by dosing weight) was observed to increase from 8.9 (range: 2.1 to 21.2) ml/h/kg in infants with postnatal age (PNA) < 30 days to 25.3 (range: 8.3 to 44.2) ml/h/kg in infants with PNA ≥ 30 days. In addition, higher clearance was observed in infants with higher body weight. Bioavailability of enteral dose compared to IV dose was estimated to be around 79%.

### Bumetanide [^116TLQPr]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Bumetanide is a loop diuretic with a rapid onset and short duration of action. Pharmacological and clinical studies have shown that 1 mg of bumetanide has a diuretic potency equivalent to approximately 40 mg of furosemide. The major site of bumetanide action is the ascending limb of the loop of Henle.

The mode of action has been determined through various clearance studies in both humans and experimental animals. Bumetanide inhibits sodium reabsorption in the ascending limb of the loop of Henle, as shown by a marked reduction of free-water clearance (CH2O) during hydration and tubular free-water reabsorption (TCH2O) during hydropenia. Reabsorption of chloride in the ascending limb is also blocked by bumetanide, and bumetanide is somewhat more chloruretic than natriuretic.

Potassium excretion is also increased by bumetanide in a dose-related fashion.

Bumetanide may have an additional action in the proximal tubule. Since phosphate reabsorption takes place largely in the proximal tubule, phosphaturia during bumetanide-induced diuresis is indicative of this additional action. This is further supported by the reduction in the renal clearance of bumetanide by probenecid, associated with a diminution in the natriuretic response. This proximal tubular activity does not seem to be related to an inhibition of carbonic anhydrase. Bumetanide does not appear to have a noticeable action on the distal tubule.

Bumetanide decreases uric acid excretion and increases serum uric acid. Following oral administration of bumetanide, the onset of diuresis occurs within 30 to 60 minutes.

### Urinary potassium excretion and sodium sensitivity in blacks [^115PrNdj]. Hypertension (2004). Low credibility.

Based on racial differences in urinary potassium excretion and responses to diuretics, we present a model suggesting that a major cause of sodium sensitivity in blacks is an augmented activity of the Na-K-2Cl cotransport in the thick ascending limb of Henle's loop. This would result in an increased ability to conserve not only sodium but also water, and an upward and rightward shift in the operating point of tubuloglomerular feedback, which may cause an increase in the glomerular capillary hydraulic pressure and predilection to glomerular injury, with and without hypertension. In this sense, the biological implication of sodium sensitivity in blacks and in humans, in general, has ramifications above and beyond salt-evoked increases in blood pressure.

### Natriuresis-guided therapy in acute heart failure: Rationale and design of the Pragmatic Urinary Sodium-based treatment algorithm in Acute Heart Failure (PUSH-AHF) trial [^112uGbVR]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). High credibility.

The possible value of natriuresis‐guided enhanced diuretic therapy and the study treatment protocol is significant. Natriuresis has all the characteristics required for a marker to actively guide decongestive treatment and move toward a personalized treatment approach in acute heart failure (HF). This is important as treatment is limited and, in many cases, insufficient. Recent studies investigating novel therapies in acute HF have been neutral. This might, in part, be due to patient selection and the timing of the initiation of the novel therapies.

In these trials, acute HF patients were not enrolled immediately at presentation and irrespective of their response to standard therapy, such as loop diuretics. Approximately half of acute HF patients show an adequate response to this therapy, limiting the potential additional effect of a novel therapy. Furthermore, we know that early treatment with intravenous loop diuretics, as well as a good diuretic response in the first 24 hours, is associated with better outcomes. By assessing natriuresis early after the initiation of loop diuretic therapy, patients with an insufficient response (non-responders) will be identified and will receive early intensified therapy. This could set the stage for future acute HF trials where initial non-responders will be eligible for novel treatment options early after admission.

Additionally, PUSH-AHF will implement a treatment protocol that includes combination diuretic therapy in patients with an insufficient natriuretic response. This treatment protocol is an adaptation aimed at optimizing therapeutic outcomes for those identified as non-responders early in their treatment course.

### Renal effects of conivaptan, furosemide, and the combination in patients with chronic heart failure [^114E2cTb]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2011). Low credibility.

Loop diuretics, though often effective for treating congestion, have significant limitations. Discovering ways to limit exposure to loop diuretics while achieving effective decongestion is an important goal of clinical research in heart failure (HF). Vasopressin antagonists are effective in removing large amounts of water, but not salt, in HF. Few data exist about the detailed renal and hormonal effects of these agents compared with or in combination with loop diuretics. This study investigated the renal and neurohormonal effects of loop diuretics, the mixed vasopressin antagonist conivaptan, and the combination in patients with chronic stable HF.

- **Methods and results**: In 8 patients with chronic stable HF on standard medical treatment, heart rate, arterial pressure, systemic vascular resistance, and cardiac output (the latter two by using impedance cardiography), as well as glomerular filtration rate (iothalamate clearance), renal blood flow (para-aminohippurate clearance), urinary volumes and urinary sodium, plasma catecholamines, renin activity, arginine vasopressin, and B-type natriuretic peptide were assessed before and at hourly intervals for 4 hours after receiving furosemide, conivaptan, or the combination on 3 different study days at a minimum of 1-week intervals. There were no significant effects of conivaptan, furosemide, or the combination on any hemodynamic variable, neurohormonal level, renal blood flow, or glomerular filtration rate. Conivaptan and furosemide similarly increased urine volumes; the effect of the combination was significantly higher.

### Natriuresis-guided diuretic therapy in acute heart failure: a pragmatic randomized trial [^117JYihV]. Nature Medicine (2023). High credibility.

The study PUSH-AHF was published in 2023 in the journal Nature Medicine. This study examined the role of natriuresis-guided diuretic therapy in patients with acute heart failure (HF). It utilized a single-center, open-label, randomized controlled trial design, involving a population of 310 patients (138 female, 172 male). The inclusion criteria specified participants with acute HF requiring treatment with intravenous loop diuretics, while key exclusion criteria included severe renal impairment requiring ultrafiltration or dialysis and dyspnea due to other causes.

- **Interventions**:
	- 150 patients received natriuresis-guided therapy, where treatment intensification was prompted if spot urinary sodium levels were below 70 mmol/L.
	- 160 patients received standard care with intravenous loop diuretics without treatment intensification.

- **Primary outcome**:
	- The study found a significant increase in urinary sodium excretion at 24 hours (409 mmol vs. 345 mmol; absolute difference (AD) 63 mmol, 95% confidence interval (CI) 18 to 109).

- **Secondary outcomes**:
	- There was no significant difference in death from all causes or HF rehospitalization at 180 days (31% vs. 31%; hazard ratio (HR) 0.92, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.38).
	- Natriuresis significantly increased at 48 hours (653 mmol vs. 575 mmol; AD 78 mmol, 95% CI 10 to 145).
	- There was no significant difference in HF rehospitalization (17% vs. 17%; HR 0.96, 96% CI 0.56 to 1.67).

- **Safety outcomes**:
	- No significant difference in renal outcomes was reported.

### Effect of 3% saline and furosemide on biomarkers of kidney injury and renal tubular function and GFR in healthy subjects - a randomized controlled trial [^113CBJuf]. BMC Nephrology (2019). High credibility.

ENaC regulates sodium transport in the distal tubule. In animal models, changes in renal and plasma osmolality altered ENaC abundance in the collecting duct and influenced ENaC activity. In previous studies, small increases in urinary ENaC γ were observed in response to 3% saline; hence, we anticipated similar increases. However, in this study, urinary ENaC γ was not changed by 3% saline. ENaC's activity is regulated by aldosterone. In this study, plasma aldosterone decreased after 3% saline and remained unchanged when furosemide was added, which may explain why urinary ENaC γ remained unchanged. Additionally, we administered a higher infusion rate of 3% saline compared to previous studies, resulting in a higher total dose, which could account for differences observed in urinary ENaC γ.

Despite all subjects maintaining an identically standardized diet for four days prior to each examination, a small but significantly lower sodium excretion was noted in the 24 hours preceding the examination where furosemide was administered. All other parameters measured in the 24-hour urine were not significantly different between examination days. This discrepancy in sodium excretion might have influenced our results, but we consider it unlikely, as sodium excretion was similar at baseline on examination days. Urinary spot samples collected on day 1 after examination showed furosemide-induced changes in urine osmolality, creatinine, potassium, and sodium concentration. These changes were not present in spot urinary samples from days 3–5 after examination, suggesting minimal carry-over effects of furosemide, which is a potential concern in this crossover study design.

### Acetazolamide and hydrochlorothiazide followed by furosemide versus furosemide and hydrochlorothiazide followed by furosemide for the treatment of adults with nephrotic edema: A randomized trial [^11663FdC]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Nephrotic edema is considered refractory if it does not respond to maximum or near-maximum doses of loop diuretics. This condition can be treated with loop diuretics and thiazides. However, animal studies show that the simultaneous downregulation of pendrin with acetazolamide and inhibition of the sodium-chloride cotransporter with hydrochlorothiazide generates significant diuresis. Additionally, furosemide administration following a pendrin inhibitor potentiates furosemide's diuretic effect. Therefore, we performed this study to compare the efficacy of acetazolamide and hydrochlorothiazide followed by furosemide versus furosemide and hydrochlorothiazide followed by furosemide for the treatment of refractory nephrotic edema.

- **Study design**: Randomized, double-blind, 2-arm, parallel trial.

- **Setting & participants**: 20 patients with refractory nephrotic edema despite treatment with 80 mg of furosemide daily and creatinine clearance > 60 mL/min.

- **Intervention**: Patients were randomly assigned to 2 groups. Group 1 (n = 10) received 250 mg of acetazolamide and 50 mg of hydrochlorothiazide daily, and group 2 (n = 10) received 40 mg of furosemide and 50 mg of hydrochlorothiazide daily for 1 week in phase 1. In phase 2, both groups received 40 mg of furosemide daily for 2 weeks.

- **Outcomes**: The primary outcome was the absolute change in weight before and at the end of each phase.

- **Measurements**: Weight and 24-hour urine volume at baseline and the end of each phase.

- **Results**: The mean weight decrease was of significantly larger magnitude in group 1 compared with group 2 at the end of phase 1 (-1.4 ± 0.52).

### A randomized trial of furosemide vs hydrochlorothiazide in patients with chronic renal failure and hypertension [^117RjN7M]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2005). Low credibility.

Loop diuretics are the drugs of choice for the treatment of hypertension in chronic renal failure patients. However, the adaptive changes in the distal nephron and the short half-life of these drugs may decrease their long-term efficacy. Thiazides are not believed to be efficient in advanced renal failure, but this is debated.

- **Methods**: We compared the efficacy of long-acting furosemide (60 mg/day) and hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg/day) in a double-blind, randomized crossover trial in seven patients with severe renal failure and hypertension (seven men, 54 ± 10 years old). The primary end-points were sodium and chloride fractional excretions after 1 month of each diuretic and then after their combination. During the trial, other treatments and the diet were controlled.

- **Results**: A trend towards an increase in the fractional excretion of sodium and chloride was observed with furosemide, but the difference did not reach the level of statistical significance (P = NS). Hydrochlorothiazide significantly increased fractional excretion of sodium and chloride from 3.7 ± 0.9 to 5.5 ± 0.3 and from 3.9 ± 0.19 to 6.5 ± 0.3, respectively (P < 0.05). The combination of the two diuretics had no additional effect on the increase in sodium and chloride fractional excretion. Furosemide, hydrochlorothiazide, and the combination of the two diuretics decreased mean arterial blood pressure by the same extent from 112 to 97, 99, and 97 mmHg, respectively (P < 0.05).

- **Conclusions**: Hydrochlorothiazide increased the fractional excretion of sodium and chloride more than furosemide did in hypertensive patients with chronic renal failure.

### The added-up albumin enhances the diuretic effect of furosemide in patients with hypoalbuminemic chronic kidney disease: a randomized controlled study [^114eFf65]. BMC Nephrology (2012). High credibility.

In this study, we focused on comparing the efficacy of diuretics between furosemide alone and the combination of furosemide plus albumin in stable hypoalbuminemic chronic kidney disease patients with clinical edema and without nephrotic range proteinuria. The results of our study show the short-term beneficial effect (at 6 hours) of the combination of furosemide plus albumin over furosemide alone in natriuresis and diuresis in these patients. This may imply that, in the situation of diuretic resistance, CKD patients with low serum albumin and fluid overload may receive more benefits from this combination regimen.

At 24 hours after treatment, the results of the study did not show the beneficial effect of the combination treatment over furosemide alone. These data are similar to the results studied by Fliser et al, who found that the superior effect of one single dose of the combination of furosemide plus albumin over furosemide alone is observed only in the first 8 hours after treatment. This has also been noted in other studies. This could possibly be due to the short duration of action of furosemide, which is a short half-life diuretic (1–2 hours). Significant natriuresis and free water clearance are noted during the 6-hour period that the diuretic is acting. However, sodium excretion gradually declines during the remaining 18 hours of the day because the associated volume depletion leads to the activation of the sodium-retaining mechanism. Our findings suggest that combination treatment increases the natriuretic potency of furosemide at least at submaximal levels.

### Sodium and fluid excretion with torsemide in healthy subjects is limited by the short duration of diuretic action [^113V4dHk]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

An ER formulation of torsemide, which increases drug delivery into solution from 2 to 12 hours, doubled daily fluid and Na+ loss and mitigated significant reductions in GFR. Further studies over a more prolonged period in target patient populations will be required to determine whether these short-term beneficial effects in healthy subjects translate into enhanced therapeutic efficacy.

### Furosemide [^111BMsjQ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Furosemide is a potent diuretic which, if given in excessive amounts, can lead to profound diuresis with water and electrolyte depletion. Therefore, careful medical supervision is required, and the dose and dose schedule must be adjusted to the individual patient's needs (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

### Unexpected effect of furosemide on radioiodine urinary excretion in patients with differentiated thyroid carcinomas treated with iodine 131 [^1155Pa1e]. Thyroid (2009). Low credibility.

In patients receiving (131)I for therapeutic purposes, diuretics are frequently used in an attempt to accelerate the elimination of unbound radioiodine, reduce its adverse effects, and shorten the hospital stay. The aims of our study were to investigate the influence of furosemide therapy on the urinary excretion of (131)I in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC), referred to radioiodine ablation after thyroidectomy, and to examine whether diuretics are useful in daily practice for patients with DTC.

- **Methods**: Forty-three patients with DTC, who had normal renal function and low (131)I uptake in the cervical region (3.55 ± 3.45%), were included in this study. Furosemide (20 mg) and potassium chloride (250 mg) were administered orally to 23 patients 3 hours after the (131)I administration, and then every 8 hours for 3 days. Twenty patients did not receive either furosemide or potassium chloride. After (131)I administration, patients collected their urine for 3 days, and radioactivity of urine samples from each micturition was expressed as a percentage of the administered dose. Radioactivity of blood samples was measured after 72 hours, and the values were corrected for decay of (131)I and expressed in relation to the administered dose. Initial whole-body measurement (immediately after (131)I administration) and the whole-body measurement after 72 hours were recorded for all patients. The 72-hour whole-body measurement was corrected for decay of (131)I and expressed as a percentage of the initial whole-body measurement.

- **Results**: Urinary excretion of (131)I was significant.

### Are diuretics a clandestine risk factor for patients with treatment-resistant hypertension [^115d76VK]? Hypertension (2025). Low credibility.

The control of blood pressure in patients with treatment-resistant hypertension is paramount and requires the use of thiazide or loop diuretics to enhance renal salt excretion and reduce expanded body fluid volumes. However, the use of diuretics in patients with treatment-resistant hypertension, without suppressing the production of aldosterone and MR (mineralocorticoid receptor) activation and signaling, may not be sufficient to prevent the development of heart failure, excessive cardiovascular mortality, and the progression of chronic kidney disease. This review examines the evidence that diuretic therapy for treatment-resistant hypertension may constitute a risk factor for preventable cardiovascular and renal disease progression, which is concealed by the strong offsetting effects of a fall in blood pressure.

To gain the full benefits of diuretic therapy in treatment-resistant hypertension may require the earlier prescription of MR antagonists in conjunction with diuretics, rather than delaying their use to fourth-line agents in those who remain uncontrolled. This will require testing in appropriate clinical trials.

### Spot urine formulas to estimate 24-hour urinary sodium excretion alter the dietary sodium and blood pressure relationship [^111TcRVB]. Hypertension (2021). Low credibility.

The analysis revealed that spot urine formulas can influence the estimation of 24-hour urinary sodium excretion. This, in turn, affects the observed relationship between dietary sodium intake and blood pressure. The findings underscore the importance of considering methodological differences in urinary sodium assessment when interpreting dietary sodium and blood pressure studies.

- **Study implications**: The results suggest potential limitations in using spot urine samples for accurately estimating sodium excretion over a 24-hour period. Researchers should be mindful of these variations when designing studies and interpreting data related to dietary sodium and its health impacts.

Further research is needed to refine these estimation methods to better assess the link between dietary sodium and cardiovascular health outcomes.

### Salt repletion and diuretic response: The role of serum chloride. A post-hoc analysis of the SALT-HF trial on furosemide and hypertonic saline solution administration in ambulatory patients with worsening heart failure [^112DDmvA]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). High credibility.

The efficacy of combining hypertonic saline solution (HSS) with loop diuretics in worsening heart failure (WHF) remains uncertain. Hypochloraemia has been associated with reduced diuretic efficacy. Some authors propose that chloride repletion may enhance natriuretic and diuretic responses. This post-hoc analysis of the SALT-HF trial evaluated the effect of single-dose administration of HSS plus intravenous (IV) furosemide versus IV furosemide, stratified by baseline serum chloride.

The analysis included 148 ambulatory patients with WHF from the double-blind, randomized SALT-HF trial. Participants received either an IV single dose of HSS plus furosemide or IV furosemide. The endpoints were 3-hour urinary sodium excretion and diuresis, 7-day congestion score, and 30-day adverse events according to chloride levels. Multivariable linear and logistic regression models assessed the relationship between the intervention and the endpoints. The mean baseline serum chloride level was 100 ± 4 mmol/L. Sixteen patients (10.8%) were identified as hypochloraemic (serum chloride < 96 mmol/L), balanced between treatment groups.

Patients with hypochloraemia showed a lower natriuretic response (p < 0.05). Interaction analysis revealed a between-treatment differential natriuretic effect based on the chloride levels (p interaction = 0.008). HSS plus furosemide increased natriuresis compared to furosemide at lower chloride levels. No differential between-treatment effect was found for 3-hour diuresis. Similar heterogeneous results were found for the 7-day clinical congestion score.

### Effect of 3% saline and furosemide on biomarkers of kidney injury and renal tubular function and GFR in healthy subjects - a randomized controlled trial [^111NRzKz]. BMC Nephrology (2019). High credibility.

- **Results**: Thirty-two subjects were screened for participation in the study. Exclusion was made for eight subjects due to anemia (1) and withdrawal of consent (7). Thus, 24 patients were included and completed the trial.

- **Demographics**: The 24 subjects (12 females, 12 males) had a mean BMI of 23.7 ± 2.8 kg/m², age 23 ± 5 years, office BP of 123/70 ± 9/8 mmHg, p-creatinine of 72 ± 13 μmol/L, urine albumin of 8 (1;10) mg/L, and p-hemoglobin of 8.8 ± 0.8 mmol/L.

### Proximal versus distal diuretics in congestive heart failure [^112LF8p7]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). High credibility.

The distal convoluted tubule accounts for less than 10% of sodium reabsorption through the sodium-chloride cotransporter (NCC) (Fig. 1) [1, 2]. However, distal sodium reabsorption can be altered by various factors such as neurohormonal activation, tubular flow rate, aldosterone, and vasopressin, each influencing either the pathological development or therapeutic treatment of heart failure (HF). Importantly, in the context of chronic diuretic use or chronic HF, hypertrophy of the distal tubule increases distal tubular sodium reabsorption, contributing to sodium retention and is a major mechanism of diuretic resistance.

Thiazide diuretics have conventionally been considered a first-line adjunct to augment diuresis, targeting the maladaptive distal tubular hypertrophy by decreasing sodium reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule through inhibition of the Na-Cl cotransporter (Fig. 1). Thiazide diuretics include metolazone, which has a long duration of action and is effective in those with advanced chronic kidney disease, hydrochlorothiazide, chlorothiazide, and chlorthalidone. Both metolazone and hydrochlorothiazide cause similar acute changes in body weight, urine output, diuretic efficiency, and patient congestion scores, suggesting that neither has established superiority. However, in the acute HF setting, metolazone treatment was associated with increased mortality compared to high-dose loop diuretic treatment in propensity analyses, although this may be attributed to confounding by indication.

### Effect of 3% saline and furosemide on biomarkers of kidney injury and renal tubular function and GFR in healthy subjects - a randomized controlled trial [^116W1ZdE]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Low credibility.

Subjects were consecutively recruited by announcements in local newspapers in the community of Holstebro, Denmark. After providing written and oral information, which included safety concerns regarding the 3% saline and furosemide infusion, written consent was obtained. A clinical history was taken, and an examination was performed. Blood and urine samples were drawn, and an ECG was conducted to ensure that the subjects met the inclusion criteria and did not meet the exclusion criteria.

With a significance level of 5% and a power of 80%, a total of 23 subjects were needed to detect an 85 ng difference in u-NGAL (SD 144 ng). During the examination, incomplete voiding was expected in some participants. Hence, it was estimated that 27 subjects should complete the study.

Examinations were carried out after four days of a standardized diet and fluid intake. The diet comprised three main meals and three minor meals. Subjects were instructed to eat variedly from the diet until satiated. The diet contained 11,000 kJ/day, composed of 55% carbohydrates, 15% protein, and 30% fat, and ensured a sodium intake of 150 mmol daily. Fluid intake was 2.5 L per day, and two cups of tea or coffee were allowed daily. No alcohol consumption was permitted.

Collection of 24-hour urine samples was performed before each examination. The 24-hour urine collection was analyzed for sodium, potassium, chloride, osmolality, creatinine, albumin, AQP2, ENaC γ, NGAL, and KIM-1.

After an overnight fast, subjects arrived at 8 AM. Two indwelling catheters for blood sampling and administration of 3% saline and furosemide were placed.

### Mechanisms to concentrate the urine: an opinion [^112YNcoH]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2008). Low credibility.

Our goal is to suggest how the renal concentrating mechanism is regulated in vivo.

- **Recent findings**: The majority of descending thin limbs of the loop of Henle lack aquaporin-1 water channels, and loops of Henle in the inner medulla lack urea transporters.

- **Summary**: Lack of water permeability in the descending thin limbs of the loop of Henle offers several advantages. First, since much less water is added to the outer medullary interstitial compartment, inhibitory control mechanisms on sodium and chloride reabsorption from the medullary thick ascending of loop of Henle, initiated by water addition from the medullary collecting duct, can be effective. Second, recycling of urea is efficient, as little urea will be washed out of the medulla. Third, delivery of a larger volume of filtrate to the medullary thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle permits both an appreciable reabsorption of sodium along with only a small fall in the luminal concentration of sodium in each of these liters. Hence, there need be only a small lumen positive voltage in the medullary thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle. The absence of urea transporters in the loop of Henle in the inner medulla is required for a passive mechanism of sodium and chloride reabsorption in the inner medulla. Control of urea reabsorption from the medullary collecting duct is needed to prevent excessive oliguria in electrolyte-poor urine.

### Diuretics: Still the mainstay of treatment [^117WKERh]. Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

The mainstay of treatment for acute decompensated heart failure is diuretic therapy. Although no data demonstrate a morbidity or mortality benefit from chronic diuretic therapy, diuretics rapidly alleviate symptoms associated with volume overload. Despite concerns that some diuretics may cause harm through neurohormonal activation, these agents remain the first-line treatment for patients with heart failure. There is no conclusive evidence that one method of diuresis is superior to another. If moderate doses of loop diuretics are insufficient, patients may be treated with higher doses, continuous infusions, or the addition of a thiazide diuretic or aldosterone antagonist. While diuretics improve symptoms, they should be used alongside other agents that enhance the long-term outcomes for patients with heart failure.

### Very high-dose furosemide continuous infusions: A case series [^1162a9of]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2020). Low credibility.

There is a paucity of data evaluating the efficacy and safety of very high-dose furosemide continuous infusions (≥ 40 mg/h) for volume removal. This infusion is a novel strategy of loop diuretic administration that may add valuable data to the literature.

- **Methods and results**: This was a retrospective chart review. Patients were eligible for inclusion if prescribed a very high-dose furosemide infusion (defined as ≥ 40 mg/h, up to 240 mg/h) from April 1, 2017, to January 1, 2019, at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital. Data collected included the change in cumulative urine output, net urine output, incidence of acute kidney injury, occurrences of hypotension, electrolyte abnormalities, body weight, and ototoxicity. Twenty-two patients were included in this analysis. The median change in 24-hour urine output from before to after very high-dose continuous furosemide infusion increased from 1193 mL at 24 hours before infusion initiation to 3518 mL at 24 hours after infusion initiation (P < .01). Serum creatinine increased 24 hours after infusion initiation but decreased within 48 hours. There were no electrolyte abnormalities. Out of 22 patients, only 2 had an occurrence of hypotension. No patients were reported to have ototoxicity.

- **Conclusions**: Very high-dose furosemide continuous infusions provide a significant increase in diuresis without worsening renal function, disturbing electrolytes, or increasing the risk of ototoxicity. Further studies are necessary to examine the efficacy and safety of this novel strategy.

### A randomized trial of distal diuretics versus dietary sodium restriction for hypertension in chronic kidney disease [^1162sKYA]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2020). High credibility.

Distal diuretics are considered less effective than loop diuretics in chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, data to support this perception are limited.

- **Methods**: To investigate whether distal diuretics are noninferior to dietary sodium restriction in reducing blood pressure (BP) in patients with CKD stage G3 or G4 and hypertension, we conducted a 6-week, randomized, open-label crossover trial. We compared amiloride/hydrochlorothiazide (5 mg/50 mg daily) with dietary sodium restriction (60 mmol per day). Antihypertension medication was discontinued for a 2-week period before randomization. We analyzed effects on BP, kidney function, and fluid balance, and related this to renal clearance of diuretics.

- **Results**: A total of 26 patients, with a mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 39 ml/min per 1.73 m², completed both treatments. Dietary sodium restriction reduced sodium excretion from 160 to 64 mmol per day. Diuretics produced a greater reduction in 24-hour systolic BP (SBP) from 138 to 124 mm Hg compared with sodium restriction, which reduced SBP from 134 to 129 mm Hg. Diuretics also had a significantly greater effect on extracellular water, eGFR, plasma renin, and aldosterone. Both interventions resulted in a similar decrease in body weight and NT-proBNP. Neither approach significantly decreased albuminuria; however, diuretics did significantly reduce urinary angiotensinogen and β2-microglobulin excretion. Although lower eGFR and higher plasma indoxyl sulfate correlated with lower diuretic clearance, the diuretic effects on body weight and BP at lower eGFR were maintained. During diuretic treatment, higher PGE2 excretion correlated with a lower free water clearance.

### Lack of durable natriuresis and objective decongestion following SGLT2 inhibition in randomized controlled trials of patients with heart failure [^111FAR4M]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2023). High credibility.

Renal tubular actions of SGLT2 inhibitors are distinct from those of conventional diuretics and aquaretics, which act on the loop of Henle and more distal segments of the nephron. In contrast, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors act in the most proximal segments of the renal tubule, specifically the S1 and S2 segments, inhibiting not only SGLT2 but also sodium-hydrogen exchanger 3. This combined inhibition increases tubular sodium, chloride, and glucose, while also triggering a marked counterregulatory activation of sodium and water reabsorption in the loop of Henle and more distal nephron segments. This activation is associated with upregulation of vasopressin, aldosterone, a-ketoglutarate, uromodulin, and carbonic anhydrase. These compensatory mechanisms counteract the natriuretic and osmotic diuretic response to SGLT2 inhibitors, resulting in a significant reduction and truncation of any short-term increase in urine volume or sodium excretion.

Nevertheless, it has been suggested that SGLT2 inhibitors may modulate the volume set point, leading selectively to a meaningful natriuresis and providing objective evidence of decongestion in patients with fluid overload, such as those with heart failure. To explore this possibility, we analyzed all randomized controlled trials of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with chronic or acutely decompensated heart failure. Our evaluation focused on two primary outcomes: (1) evidence of a meaningful natriuresis and (2) objective evidence of decongestion assessed through physical signs and physiological testing.

### The effect of thiazide diuretics on urinary prostaglandin E2 excretion and serum sodium in the general population [^114RoZ2b]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Thiazide diuretics are widely used antihypertensive drugs that exert their effect by inhibiting the sodium chloride cotransporter in the kidney distal convoluted tubule. Although thiazide diuretics reduce cardiovascular risk, they can also cause serious adverse effects, including hyponatremia, typically defined as serum sodium < 135 mmol/L. Thiazide-induced hyponatremia (TIH) is the most common form of drug-induced hyponatremia requiring hospitalization and is reported in 14% of people using thiazide diuretics in a primary care setting and up to 30% of people using them in an outpatient clinic setting.

Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is an essential lipid mediator modulating several aspects of kidney function via its effects on four PGE2 receptors: EP1 to EP4. Under certain conditions, PGE2 can stimulate aquaporin-2 mediated water reabsorption in the kidney collecting duct independent of the antidiuretic hormone vasopressin. Although the pathogenesis of TIH remains incompletely understood, increased water reabsorption due to the actions of PGE2 via its EP4 receptor has been reported as a possible cause. Patients with TIH had higher urinary PGE2 excretion compared to patients who used thiazide diuretics but remained normonatremic. The risk of TIH was also increased in patients who carried a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in SLCO2A1, encoding a prostaglandin transporter in the collecting duct. It was therefore postulated that the SNP in SLCO2A1 reduced PGE2 transport and thereby allowed PGE2 to increase water reabsorption.

### Urinary sodium excretion and salt intake are not associated with blood pressure variability in a white general population [^114WgcMy]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Low credibility.

An important strength of the study is that both the observational population‐based study and the intervention trial show similar results, which provides substantial evidence for a null association. Further strengths include the ability to adjust for a large series of potential confounders. For example, adjusting for prior cardiovascular disease did not change the results, and the large study population allowed us to demonstrate that excluding individuals using antihypertensive medication did not affect the results.

### The blunted loop diuretic response in acute heart failure is driven by reduced tubular responsiveness rather than insufficient tubular delivery. The role of furosemide urine excretion on diuretic and natriuretic response in acute heart failure [^111bs6eB]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2023). Low credibility.

Diuretic response in heart failure is blunted when compared to healthy individuals, but the pathophysiology underlying this phenomenon is unclear. We aimed to investigate whether the diuretic resistance mechanism is related to insufficient furosemide tubular delivery or low tubular responsiveness.

- **Methods and results**: We conducted a prospective, observational study of 50 patients with acute heart failure, divided into two groups based on previous furosemide use (furosemide naïve: n = 28 [56%] and chronic furosemide users: n = 22 [44%]). Each patient received a protocol-derived, standardized furosemide dose based on body weight. We measured diuretic response and urine furosemide concentrations. The furosemide naïve group had significantly higher urine volumes and natriuresis when compared to chronic users at all timepoints (all p < 0.05). Urine furosemide delivery was similar in furosemide naïve versus chronic users after accounting for differences in estimated glomerular filtration rate (28.02 [21.03–35.89] vs. 29.70 [18.19–34.71] mg, p = 0.87). However, the tubular response to delivered diuretic was dramatically higher in naïve versus chronic users; the urine volume per 1 μg/ml of urine furosemide at 2 hours was 148.6 ± 136.1 versus 50.6 ± 56.1 mL (p = 0.005).

- **Conclusions**: Patients naïve to furosemide have significantly better diuresis and natriuresis when compared to chronic furosemide users. The blunted diuretic response in patients with chronic loop diuretic exposure is driven by decreased tubular responsiveness rather than insufficient furosemide tubular delivery.

### Proximal versus distal diuretics in congestive heart failure [^111zZbbA]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Low credibility.

Use of spironolactone to elicit increases in natriuresis has been well-described. Short-term spironolactone treatment increased urinary sodium excretion, resulting in decreases in net sodium balance, body weight, and neurohormonal activation in heart failure (HF) patients abstaining from diuretic use. Furthermore, in severe HF patients with diuretic resistance — evident from persistent congestion despite maximal tolerable doses of loop diuretics and ACE inhibition — the addition of spironolactone further increased sodium excretion and decreased body weight, collectively supporting the diuretic and natriuretic properties of spironolactone.

- **Natriuresis and diuresis in chronic HF**: Mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonists also cause reductions in natriuretic hormones. A secondary analysis of the RALES trial demonstrated that spironolactone decreased BNP following three months of treatment. Additionally, both eplerenone and finerenone elicited comparable reductions in NT-proBNP after three months in HFrEF patients, while spironolactone decreased NT-proBNP following nine months in HFpEF patients.

- **Mechanisms in HFrEF patients**: Synonymous with SGLT2 inhibitors, the rapid time to statistical benefit (20 days) in the composite endpoints in HFrEF patients prescribed MR antagonists suggests that the mechanisms responsible for cardioprotection are promptly activated following treatment initiation. While the fast-acting diuretic effects may intuitively represent an important mediator, it is important to recognize that MR antagonists also possess anti-hypertrophic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-fibrotic effects that largely mediate the cardiovascular benefits noted.

### Effect of 3% saline and furosemide on biomarkers of kidney injury and renal tubular function and GFR in healthy subjects - a randomized controlled trial [^111qQ1U5]. BMC Nephrology (2019). High credibility.

In critically ill patients and those undergoing surgery, intravenous fluid treatment is an important part of maintaining cardiovascular homeostasis. Crystalloids and colloids are widely used for fluid resuscitation. Crystalloids differ in electrolyte composition. Crystalloids with a high content of sodium and chloride, such as isotonic saline, induce hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis compared to solutions with a lower sodium and chloride content, particularly when administered in higher doses. Chloride and hyperchloremic acidosis may impair renal blood flow and induce kidney injury.

This was first demonstrated in animal experiments, where high chloride concentration during renal perfusion was associated with increased renal vasoconstriction and reductions in renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate. In healthy subjects, isotonic saline compared to infusion with fluids with lower sodium and chloride contents decreased renal blood flow (RBF). In patients in an emergency department, infusion of low chloride-containing solutions was associated with a lesser degree of acute kidney injury (AKI) compared to fluid solutions with a higher chloride content. In the clinical setting, however, the importance of dyschloremia and infusion of high chloride-containing solutions is still under much debate.

In daily practice, plasma creatinine is used to estimate renal function. In cases of AKI, changes in creatinine are seen within days. Novel biomarkers, such as neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), can indicate kidney damage within hours.

### Torsemide [^114a4Mw5]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2017). Low credibility.

With oral dosing, the onset of diuresis occurs within 1 hour, and the peak effect occurs during the first or second hour, lasting about 6 to 8 hours. In healthy subjects given single doses, the dose-response relationship for sodium excretion is linear over the dose range of 2.5 mg to 20 mg. The increase in potassium excretion is negligible following a single dose of up to 10 mg and only slight (5 mEq to 15 mEq) following a single dose of 20 mg.

- **Edema**: Torsemide has been studied in controlled trials in patients with New York Heart Association Class II to IV heart failure. Patients who received 10 mg to 20 mg of daily torsemide achieved significantly greater reductions in weight and edema than those who received a placebo.

- **Hypertension**: In patients with essential hypertension, torsemide has been shown in controlled studies to lower blood pressure when administered once a day at doses of 5 mg to 10 mg. The antihypertensive effect is near maximal after 4 to 6 weeks of treatment but may continue to increase for up to 12 weeks. Systolic and diastolic supine and standing blood pressures are all reduced, with no significant orthostatic effect and only a minimal peak-trough difference in blood pressure reduction. The antihypertensive effects of torsemide are, like those of other diuretics, on average greater in black patients (a low-renin population) than in non-black patients.

When torsemide is first administered, daily urinary sodium excretion increases for at least a week. With chronic administration, however, this effect diminishes slightly.

### Thiazide-associated hyponatremia: Clinical manifestations and pathophysiology [^111oUoRs]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia can complicate thiazide use in a minority of susceptible individuals and can result in significant morbidity and even mortality. Risk factors for thiazide-associated hyponatremia include age, female sex, and possibly low body mass. A genetic susceptibility has recently been uncovered. Although frequently developing early after thiazide treatment initiation, many cases of hyponatremia present after months or years of use. Many cases are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms, but seizures and/or coma may develop, especially in those with acute onset.

The pathophysiology is incompletely understood and includes some combination of excessive fluid intake, cation (sodium and potassium) depletion, osmotic inactivation of sodium, and reduced ability to excrete free water. Reduced distal delivery of filtrate, reduced solite load (urea), direct inhibition of the sodium-chloride cotransporter, and increased collecting duct permeability to water mediated by some combination of antidiuretic hormone, prostaglandins, and thiazides themselves may contribute to this diluting defect. The predominant pathophysiologic mechanism(s) varies from patient to patient.

The cornerstone of therapy is cessation of thiazide use, cation repletion, and oral fluid restriction. If severely symptomatic, 3% saline solution may be indicated. Overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia must be avoided in all cases.

### Critical analysis of the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on renal tubular sodium, water and chloride homeostasis and their role in influencing heart failure outcomes [^1179Wq3t]. Circulation (2023). High credibility.

The primary endpoint for the regulatory approval of diuretics is the alleviation of edema in sodium-avid states. Thiazide and loop diuretics, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, and vasopressin antagonists ameliorate fluid retention in heart failure, hepatic cirrhosis, and nephrotic syndrome. In contrast, there are no reports of a favorable effect of SGLT2 inhibitors to reduce the edema of heart failure or the ascites of hepatic cirrhosis. Observations about decongestion are difficult to interpret when patients are being concurrently treated with an intensified regimen of loop diuretics.

It is interesting that in patients hospitalized for heart failure, there may be little relationship between the magnitude of natriuresis and the relief of symptoms. Intensive intravenous loop diuretics produce a greater diuresis but not greater effects on pulmonary congestion. The addition of hydrochlorothiazide to a loop diuretic yields a modest diuretic effect, but no incremental benefit on dyspnea. Acetazolamide potentiates the natriuretic response to loop diuretics but without a reported benefit on symptoms. Conventional diuretics may preferentially act to remove excess fluid from the interstitial space, with little change in total blood volume, cardiac filling pressures, or symptoms.

### Renal function in relation to sodium intake: A quantitative review of the literature [^114pW97s]. Kidney International (2017). Low credibility.

We undertook a quantitative literature review to search for evidence underpinning guidelines proposing a reduction of sodium intake to less than 2.4 g/d for the management of chronic kidney disease. We searched PubMed for peer-reviewed articles published from January 1980 through May 2016. Two investigators screened 5,072 publications and extracted data from 36, including 11 cross-sectional and 5 longitudinal observational studies and 20 intervention trials. Within-study effect sizes were pooled and standardized to a sodium gradient of 100 mmol/d using inverse-variance weighted random effects models. Among cross-sectional studies, the pooled odds ratio for albuminuria was 1.23 (95% confidence interval, 0.92–1.64, P = 0.16), and the pooled mean difference in glomerular filtration rate amounted to 8.5 ml/min (CI, -2.3 to 19.2 ml/min; P = 0.12). In the cohort studies, the pooled relative risk of a renal endpoint was 1.08 (CI, 0.92–1.29; P = 0.35).

In the intervention trials (median duration, 14 days [range, 4–186 days]), the mean differences in estimated glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria (high vs. low sodium intake) averaged 4.6 ml/min (CI, 3.4–5.8 ml/min; P < 0.0001) and 53% (CI, 21–84; P = 0.001), respectively. Cochran's Q-statistic indicated significant heterogeneity among cross-sectional studies for both estimated glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria (P < 0.0001) and among intervention trials for albuminuria (P = 0.04). In conclusion, there is no robust evidence suggesting that long-term reduction of salt intake would prevent chronic kidney disease.

### Furosemide [^116v9PU9]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Overdosage:

- **Signs and symptoms**: The principal signs and symptoms of overdose with furosemide include dehydration, blood volume reduction, hypotension, electrolyte imbalance, hypokalemia, and hypochloremic alkalosis. These are extensions of its diuretic action.

- **Acute toxicity**: The acute toxicity of furosemide has been determined in mice, rats, and dogs. In all three, the oral LD50 exceeded 1000 mg/kg body weight, while the intravenous LD50 ranged from 300 to 680 mg/kg. The acute intragastric toxicity in neonatal rats is 7 to 10 times that of adult rats.

- **Toxicity concentration**: The concentration of furosemide in biological fluids associated with toxicity or death is not known.

- **Treatment of overdosage**: Treatment is supportive and consists of replacement of excessive fluid and electrolyte losses. Serum electrolytes, carbon dioxide level, and blood pressure should be determined frequently. Adequate drainage must be assured in patients with urinary bladder outlet obstruction, such as prostatic hypertrophy. Hemodialysis does not accelerate furosemide elimination.

### Sodium and water disorders [^113pxZLV]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2025). Low credibility.

The balancing of fluids and electrolytes is a core function of the kidneys. There are redundant mechanisms within the body to sense the adequacy of organ perfusion and the composition of body fluids, aimed at maintaining hemodynamics and protecting an environment for optimal cellular function. Sodium and water are key components of extracellular fluid and are regulated in response to end-organ perfusion and serum tonicity. Baroreceptors activate the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, sympathetic nervous system, vasopressin, and atrial natriuretic peptide to adjust sodium handling to alter extracellular volume. Osmoreceptors affect anti-diuretic hormone release and aquaporin activity in the medullary collecting duct to modify the handling of water.

Disordered handling of sodium and/or water may be adaptive or maladaptive. Understanding the stimuli and responses to clinical scenarios assists clinicians in developing appropriate treatment strategies.

### Proximal versus distal diuretics in congestive heart failure [^114trtYP]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Low credibility.

Natriuresis and diuresis in chronic heart failure are influenced by different mechanisms. Acute SGLT2 inhibition causes an initial increase in proximal tubular natriuresis and a parallel increase in total natriuresis, measured using fractional sodium and lithium excretion. This acute natriuretic response is further accentuated during concurrent SGLT2 inhibitor and loop diuretic administration, suggesting a synergistic response probably driven by upstream SGLT2 inhibition causing greater sodium delivery to the downstream loop of Henle.

While the SGLT2 inhibitor-mediated increase in total natriuresis was evident following 14 days of treatment, counterregulatory adaptations to tubular sodium handling can promote tachyphylaxis to total natriuresis. For instance, proteomic analyses have found that empagliflozin can increase circulating complement activation (CA) and uromodulin, which can cause counterregulatory increases in sodium reabsorption in the proximal tubule and loop of Henle, respectively.

SGLT2 inhibition can also activate aldosterone due to intravascular volume contraction, further promoting sodium reabsorption in the distal tubule, while osmotic diuresis associated with SGLT2 inhibitor-mediated glucosuria can increase vasopressin to promote fluid retention. Perhaps as a result of these physiological changes, attenuated natriuresis was observed at 14 days compared to 1 day of SGLT2 inhibitor treatment, despite remaining elevated compared to placebo at 14 days. Furthermore, urinary sodium excretion or fractional excretion of sodium were not different following longer-term (4–6 weeks) treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors compared to placebo control.

### Bumex [^1156F5RD]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Bumex is a loop diuretic with a rapid onset and short duration of action. Pharmacological and clinical studies have demonstrated that 1 mg of Bumex has a diuretic potency equivalent to approximately 40 mg of furosemide. The primary site of Bumex action is the ascending limb of the loop of Henle.

The mode of action has been determined through various clearance studies in both humans and experimental animals. Bumex inhibits sodium reabsorption in the ascending limb of the loop of Henle, as evidenced by a marked reduction of free-water clearance (CH2O) during hydration and tubular free-water reabsorption (TCH2O) during hydropenia. Reabsorption of chloride in the ascending limb is also blocked by Bumex, and it is somewhat more chloruretic than natriuretic.

Potassium excretion is also increased by Bumex in a dose-dependent manner. There may be an additional action in the proximal tubule, as phosphate reabsorption primarily occurs in this region. Phosphaturia during Bumex-induced diuresis suggests this additional action, which is further supported by the reduction in renal clearance of Bumex by probenecid, associated with a decrease in the natriuretic response. This proximal tubular activity does not seem to be related to an inhibition of carbonic anhydrase. Bumex does not appear to have a noticeable action on the distal tubule.

Bumex decreases uric acid excretion and increases serum uric acid. Following oral administration of Bumex, the onset of diuresis occurs within 30 to 60 minutes, with peak activity reached between 1 and 2 hours.

### Clinical importance of urinary sodium excretion in acute heart failure [^117TqJnv]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Low credibility.

Low urinary sodium excretion during the first 6 hours after initiation of loop diuretic therapy in acute heart failure is associated with lower urine output on the first day and with all-cause mortality, independent of urinary volume.

### Ethnic differences in renal responses to furosemide [^111q8tZa]. Hypertension (2008). Low credibility.

Blacks have a greater tendency to retain Na than whites. This study sought evidence for ethnic differences in parameters reflective of Na uptake by the Na, K,2Cl cotransporter in the thick ascending limb. These parameters included the urine concentration and urinary excretion of certain cations before and after furosemide administration (40 mg IV). Subjects were healthy and aged 18 to 36 years. During the preceding overnight period, urine volume was lower and osmolality was higher in blacks than in whites, an ethnic difference that disappeared when water intake was restricted to infused normal saline (60 mL/h). Plasma vasopressin levels were higher in black males than in other sex/ethnic groups. Baseline urinary excretion rates of K, Ca, and Mg were significantly lower in blacks than in whites.

After furosemide administration (0 to 1 hour), K and Ca excretion rates increased. The proportionate ethnic difference decreased from 44% to 22% and from 22% to 10%, respectively, which was consistent with blacks having more basal Na, K,2Cl cotransporter activity to inhibit. During a later post-furosemide period (1 to 5 hours), urinary concentrations of Ca and Mg recovered more slowly in blacks, consistent with greater reuptake in the thick ascending limb.

In summary, there were distinct ethnic differences in renal handling of Ca and Mg both basally and in response to furosemide. These differences were consistent with a more active Na, K,2Cl cotransporter in the thick ascending limb in blacks. An increase in vasopressin levels appeared to explain greater urine concentrations in black males but not black females.

### Proximal versus distal diuretics in congestive heart failure [^112LrgsS]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Low credibility.

The retention of sodium and water, and the consequential fluid accumulation in the extracellular compartment, is a cardinal feature of heart failure (HF), irrespective of the left ventricular ejection fraction. The expansion of the extracellular volume, manifesting as volume overload, represents a leading cause for HF hospitalization, with the severity of volume overload associated with adverse HF outcomes. Alleviating volume expansion through the use of loop diuretics is a cornerstone of HF treatment. However, achieving decongestion represents a longstanding challenge due to multiple physiological adaptations that favor the retention of sodium, with persistent fluid overload despite increasing diuretic dosing (i.e. diuretic resistance) representing a cardinal sign of worsening HF. Indeed, low urine output in response to loop diuretics or the need for repeated short-term intravenous administration of loop diuretics are both associated with mortality in the acute HF setting. Furthermore, high diuretic dose requirements or dose escalation in the chronic HF setting are associated with hospitalization.

Accordingly, there is growing interest in understanding the diuretic and natriuretic properties of contemporary medical therapies such as sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, carbonic anhydrase (CA) inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonists, and their roles in managing volume overload in HF, especially as adjuncts to loop diuretic therapy.

### Effect of 3% saline and furosemide on biomarkers of kidney injury and renal tubular function and GFR in healthy subjects - a randomized controlled trial [^111k1agJ]. BMC Nephrology (2019). High credibility.

Methods

- **Subjects**: Screening examination included physical examination, medical history, ECG, office BP, clinical biochemistry, and urinary albumin analysis.

- **Inclusion criteria**: Healthy women and men, aged 18–40 years, with a BMI of 18.5–30.0 kg/m².

- **Exclusion criteria**: History or clinical signs of diseases in the central nervous system, lungs, thyroid gland, heart, liver, or kidneys; diabetes mellitus or malignancies; clinically important deviations in screening blood or urinary samples; office blood pressure > 140 mmHg systolic and/or > 90 mmHg diastolic; nursing or pregnancy; alcohol or drug abuse; smoking; allergy or intolerance towards furosemide; or unwillingness to participate. Withdrawal criteria: Symptoms of hypotension or office BP repeatedly below 50 mmHg diastolic and/or 90 mmHg systolic; development of exclusion criteria.

- **Design**: The study was a placebo-controlled, randomized, single-blinded, crossover trial. After inclusion, subjects were allocated to treatment via computer-generated randomization in blocks of six. Consequently, the subjects received glucose (placebo) or furosemide in a random order on two separate examination days. A washout period of at least 14 days was required between examinations.

- **Study drugs**: Hypertonic saline (3% NaCl, Skanderborg Pharmacy, Skanderborg, Denmark) was given intravenously as a continuous infusion (7 ml/kg/hour) for 60 minutes. Furosemide (Furix, 2 mL of 10 mg/ml, Takeda Pharma, Osaka, Japan) and isotonic glucose (2 mL 50 g glucose monohydrate/l, Fresenius, Bad Homburg vor der Höhe, Germany) were identical in appearance to the study subjects.

### Effects of dapagliflozin on sodium excretion, blood pressure and volume status in patients with type 2 diabetes and/or chronic kidney disease: The DAPASALT trial [^114vhTVP]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the natriuretic effects of dapagliflozin. The primary endpoint, defined as the change in 24-hour sodium excretion during dapagliflozin treatment, was calculated as the difference between the average sodium excretion at baseline (average of Days −3 to −1) and at the start of treatment (average of Days 2–4; hereafter referred to as Day 4), based on earlier clinical findings.

Secondary objectives included the effects of dapagliflozin on 24-hour sodium excretion from baseline to the end of treatment (average of Days 12–14; hereafter referred to as Day 14) and from the end of treatment to the end of the washout period (average of Days 15–17; hereafter referred to as Day 17). Additional secondary endpoints included changes in 24-hour glucose excretion, urine volume, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and extracellular volume from baseline to Day 4 and Day 14, and from Day 14 to Day 17.

Exploratory endpoints, assessed at the same timepoints, included changes in intracellular volume, body weight, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) biomarkers (plasma renin and 24-hour urinary aldosterone), volume-related biomarkers (plasma copeptin and plasma B-type natriuretic peptide [BNP]), and fractional excretion of endogenous lithium, a marker for sodium reabsorption in the proximal tubule. Additionally, changes in daytime and nighttime blood pressure, as well as 24-hour pulse pressure and 24-hour heart rate, were assessed. Daytime and nighttime blood pressure were defined according to established definitions.

### Diuretics in patients with chronic kidney disease [^111Wa9xM]. Nature Reviews. Nephrology (2025). Low credibility.

Diuretic drugs act on electrolyte transporters in the kidney to induce diuresis and are often used in chronic kidney disease (CKD), given that nephron loss creates a deficit in the ability to excrete dietary sodium, which promotes an increase in plasma volume. This rise in plasma volume is exacerbated by CKD-induced systemic and intra-renal activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system, which further limits urinary sodium excretion. In the absence of a compensatory decrease in systemic vascular resistance, increases in plasma volume induced by sodium retention can manifest as a rise in systemic arterial blood pressure.

Management of sodium and volume overload in patients with CKD is therefore typically based on restriction of dietary sodium intake and the use of diuretic agents to enhance urinary sodium excretion. Thiazide and thiazide-type diuretics are foundational therapies for the management of hypertension, whereas loop diuretics are often needed for volume overload, which might also require combination therapies. Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists have an important role in the management of diuretic-resistant volume overload or treatment-resistant hypertension. Additionally, diuretics can be used for the diagnosis of kidney diseases and in the management of hyperkalaemia or hypokalaemia, hyponatraemia, hypercalcaemia, and hypomagnesaemia.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: From pathophysiology to management [^117CHGVN]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Loop diuretics, such as furosemide, increase urinary salt and water excretion via inhibition of the sodium-potassium-chloride cotransporter in the Henle loop to reduce reabsorption of these solutes. They are listed in the European guidelines as a second-line therapy for SIAD in combination with salt tablets (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence) but are not endorsed in the international expert panel recommendations. The guideline recommendation was made on the strength of several case series, though only one of these included patients with SIAD rather than patients with heart failure and cirrhosis, and that report from 1973 included only five patients.

Loop diuretics are useful in the treatment of hypervolemia; however, in the absence of volume excess, natriuresis may cause volume depletion, which stimulates AVP release, thereby worsening hyponatremia. The randomized trial discussed earlier that evaluated FR with and without furosemide and salt tablets to prevent hypovolemia in SIAD found no significant benefit to the addition of frusemide 20 to 40 mg daily compared with FR alone but observed increased rates of acute kidney injury and hypokalemia. Furosemide increases urinary potassium excretion, which can be potentiated by increased sodium in the distal nephron. Because of this recent evidence, we do not recommend loop diuretics for euvolemic hyponatremia.

### Sodium and fluid excretion with torsemide in healthy subjects is limited by the short duration of diuretic action [^113mgF9V]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). High credibility.

The main new findings from this study of healthy subjects are that a novel ER formulation of torsemide, which delivers the drug into solution over 10 to 12 hours, prolonged the natriuresis and diuresis. It also doubled the loss of fluid, body weight, and Na+ without a significant fall in GFR. The diuresis was followed by sustained renal fluid and Na+ retention; however, this postdiuretic period was shortened after torsemide ER from approximately 18 to 12 hours. Neither formulation led to a significant loss of potassium.

The ER formulation prolonged the time to maximal plasma torsemide concentration by 3.5-fold, with a corresponding reduction in torsemide AUC at 1 to 3 hours of 59%, but a doubling of AUC at 8 to 10 hours. The overall exposure to torsemide ER was reduced by 18%. The more gradual rise to peak renal torsemide excretion prolonged the time that the drug remained in the highly effective ascending phase of the hysteretic relationship between the increase in urinary Na+ excretion above basal and log renal torsemide excretion. This prolonged exposure thereby increased Na+ excreted per unit torsemide excreted (natriuretic efficiency).

Thus, torsemide ER reduced postdiuretic Na+ reclamation, maintained GFR, and enhanced natriuretic efficiency. Together, these effects resulted in greater Na+, fluid, and body weight loss following a single dose, despite a somewhat reduced bioavailability.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: From pathophysiology to management [^112epHiQ]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Low credibility.

There is no universally recommended fluid restriction (FR) limit. For FR to be effective, there must be a negative fluid balance, with electrolyte-free water output exceeding input. For this reason, US recommendations suggest FR that is 500 mL below the 24-hour urine output. This is a "rule of thumb" to achieve this, given the difficulty of measuring insensible losses. For consistency, most available studies evaluate FR in the range of 500 to 1000 mL.

The efficacy of a 1000-mL FR was recently evaluated in comparison to no treatment, in a randomized trial involving 46 patients (mean age 73 years) with chronic asymptomatic hyponatremia, with mean baseline plasma sodium (pNa) of 127 mmol/L. This trial observed a modest early rise in serum sodium of 3 mmol/L in fluid-restricted patients compared to 1 mmol/L with no treatment, which allowed ad libitum fluid intake with an average intake of 1.5 L. However, 39% of patients assigned to FR did not respond, with serum sodium persistently below 130 mmol/L after three days. Notably, 9 of 23 (39%) participants receiving no treatment achieved pNa greater than or equal to 130 mmol/L after four days, illustrating a relatively high rate of "spontaneous correction" even in chronic hyponatremia.

These results were similar to the Thai EFFUSE-FLUID trial involving 92 participants with hyponatremia, mean age 59 years, that evaluated FR (limit 500–1000 mL), determined based on urine/serum electrolyte ratio (i.e. Fürst ratio, discussed later) with or without furosemide and oral salt tablets. This trial reported a mean increase in pNa of 5 mmol/L after four days in the 31 patients allocated to FR alone; however, there was no control.

### Clinical importance of urinary sodium excretion in acute heart failure [^111wnvFM]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Low credibility.

The treatment of acute heart failure (AHF) has not changed over the last decades and is focused on the alleviation of congestion, volume overload, and shortening the time spent in hospital. As compared with chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, the prognosis of patients admitted for worsening heart failure is extremely poor, with almost 30–40% of patients dying within the first year, and a substantial number being rehospitalized for heart failure shortly after discharge.

Despite treatment with loop diuretics, vasodilators, and oxygen, 25% of patients with AHF still have residual signs of congestion at discharge. Most of the decongestion achieved during hospitalization occurs early after admission, with the effect of therapy decreasing in subsequent days. While loop diuretics are the most important drugs in AHF, it has also proven extremely difficult to assess their treatment effect by evaluating congestion status after the start of therapy. However, it is now clear that a more rigorous and rapid diuretic response is associated with better outcomes.

Recently, a consensus paper from the Heart Failure Association of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) on diuretic therapy has proposed investigating either spot urinary sodium and/or diuresis very early after diuretic initiation in AHF. It is proposed to intensify or expand (loop) diuretic treatment if natriuresis or diuresis are insufficient based on these metrics. However, scientific evidence for this recommendation is limited since there are only scarce contemporary studies.

### Furosemide [^116Eds3k]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Geriatric use:

- **Controlled clinical studies**: Of furosemide did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.

- **Dose selection**: In general, dose selection for the elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range. This reflects the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

- **Excretion and renal function**: This drug is substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function (see precautions: General and dosage and administration).

### The added-up albumin enhances the diuretic effect of furosemide in patients with hypoalbuminemic chronic kidney disease: a randomized controlled study [^1124af5Z]. BMC Nephrology (2012). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a common problem in clinical practice. The deterioration of renal function impairs salt and water clearance, leading to edema and volume overload. The treatment of choice in this situation is the administration of a diuretic, especially a high-potency loop diuretic, to enhance free water and salt clearance.

Furosemide is one of the most commonly used high-potency loop diuretics in clinical practice. It is an organic acid, which is highly bound to protein (mostly forming a furosemide-albumin complex). It reaches the proximal tubular epithelial cells and is secreted in an active free form by the anion transporter into the tubular lumen. The site of action of furosemide is the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle. The mechanism of action is to inhibit active chloride transport at the Na-K-2Cl channel, which leads to impaired sodium and chloride reabsorption, resulting in natriuresis and free water clearance.

Despite the high potency of natriuresis, diuretic resistance can still occur. The proposed mechanisms of diuretic resistance are as follows: - Firstly, a decline in renal perfusion decreases the rate of drug delivery to its site of action.

- Secondly, severe hypoalbuminemia impairs furosemide secretion into the tubular lumen.

- Thirdly, the accumulation of organic acids, such as hippurate in a renal failure state, may compete with furosemide secretion into the tubular lumen via the organic anion transport system at the proximal tubule, thus decreasing the diuretic activity of furosemide.

### Determinants of urinary output response to IV furosemide in acute kidney injury: A pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic study [^1144r1yk]. Critical Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

This study assessed the determinants of urinary output response to furosemide in acute kidney injury, focusing on whether the response is related to altered pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics. It was a prospective cohort study conducted in a tertiary ICU with thirty critically ill patients who had acute kidney injury without preexisting renal impairment or recent diuretic exposure.

A single dose of IV furosemide was administered to these patients. Baseline markers of intravascular volume status were obtained prior to administering furosemide. Six-hour creatinine clearance, hourly plasma/urinary furosemide concentrations, and hourly urinary output were used to assess furosemide pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics parameters.

Of the 30 patients enrolled, 11 had stage-1 (37%), nine had stage-2 (30%), and 10 had stage-3 (33%) Acute Kidney Injury Network acute kidney injury. Seventy-three percent were septic, 47% required norepinephrine, and 53% were mechanically ventilated. Urinary output doubled in 20 patients (67%) following IV furosemide.

Measured creatinine clearance was strongly associated with the amount of urinary furosemide excreted and was the only reliable predictor of the urinary output after furosemide, with an area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve of 0.75 (95% CI, 0.57–0.93). In addition to altered pharmacokinetics (p < 0.01), a reduced pharmacodynamic response to furosemide also became important when creatinine clearance was reduced to less than 40 mL/min/1.73 m² (p = 0.01).
