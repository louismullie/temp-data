## Question

Assessment and plan for factor V leiden

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the assessment and plan for factor V Leiden. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology and epidemiology to anchor pretest probability. Then, I should verify when testing is indicated versus discouraged. Next, I will review the optimal testing strategy and timing. After that, I need to interpret results in clinical context. Then, I will outline management for acute VTE, duration of anticoagulation, and special populations such as pregnancy, unusual-site thrombosis, and asymptomatic relatives. Finally, I should consider perioperative and lifestyle counseling, and close with a concise decision algorithm and key takeaways, ensuring each step aligns with contemporary guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiology and epidemiology so I don't jump to conclusions. Factor V Leiden is a G1691A substitution causing Arg506Gln, which abolishes a cleavage site for activated protein C and produces APC resistance with increased thrombin generation; heterozygosity confers about a 5-fold increased relative risk for first VTE, and homozygosity confers roughly a 50-fold increase, with population prevalence near 5% in those of European ancestry and much lower in many Asian and African populations, which shapes pretest probability and testing yield [^114HuRft].

> Hold on, let's not jump to testing everyone. I need to check guideline positions on when testing changes management. Multiple high-credibility guidelines converge on a restrictive approach: do not test at the time of acute VTE, do not test after provoked VTE, do not test asymptomatic relatives routinely, and do not test to guide hormone therapy decisions; instead, reserve testing for select scenarios where results would alter anticoagulation duration or prophylaxis, such as unprovoked VTE with family history, unusual-site thrombosis, or specific pregnancy contexts, and avoid testing in cerebral venous thrombosis except in narrow high-pretest-probability settings [^115DEvFD] [^111chGNk] [^114KTP3M] [^111srdxY] [^114UEVct] [^1167TZCB].

> Wait, let me verify the timing and methodology because false results are common if I get this wrong. Testing should occur off anticoagulation for at least 2–4 weeks, ideally after completing initial therapy, using a two-stage approach with a screening APC resistance assay followed by confirmatory F5 genotyping; I initially thought testing during acute treatment might be acceptable, but that risks false negatives or indeterminate results, so I should correct that and insist on waiting until off therapy when feasible [^1119YpAH].

> I will now examine how to interpret results in clinical context. A positive FVL test modestly increases recurrence risk after a first unprovoked VTE, but the absolute effect is small and must be balanced against bleeding risk; importantly, recurrence risk is dominated by whether the index event was provoked or unprovoked and by transient risk factors, so I should not overweigh genotype when deciding on extended anticoagulation [^111A4HF3] [^115U5eQn].

> Next, I should review acute VTE management because I need to ensure I'm not changing standard care. Acute DVT or PE should be treated per guideline-directed anticoagulation with LMWH, fondaparinux, DOACs, or warfarin, and the presence of FVL alone does not dictate a different initial regimen; I should confirm there are no special anticoagulant choices for FVL, and indeed there are none beyond standard VTE protocols [^111A4HF3].

> Let me think about duration of anticoagulation, since this is where FVL sometimes influences decisions. For a first provoked VTE, 3–6 months is standard; for a first unprovoked VTE, indefinite anticoagulation is reasonable if bleeding risk is low and recurrence risk is high, and FVL heterozygosity can be considered a modest risk enhancer, though it should not be the sole determinant; for homozygous FVL or combined thrombophilia, many guidelines support stronger consideration of indefinite anticoagulation after a first unprovoked event, but I should double-check that this is framed as conditional and individualized rather than automatic [^117L7tse] [^111A4HF3] [^111ZSjF2].

> But wait, what if the thrombosis is in an unusual site. I should confirm site-specific guidance. In mesenteric or portal vein thrombosis, especially with proven thrombophilia, several guidelines recommend indefinite anticoagulation; in Budd-Chiari syndrome, a full thrombophilia workup is advised at diagnosis because results may influence long-term anticoagulation decisions, so I need to ensure I escalate evaluation in these scenarios [^11434RnZ] [^115jy3YV] [^113BJLcU] [^111qic5h].

> I need to check pregnancy-specific management because this is a common area of confusion. For heterozygous FVL without personal VTE, routine antepartum prophylaxis is not recommended; for homozygous FVL or combined thrombophilia, antepartum and postpartum prophylaxis are recommended regardless of family history; for women with prior VTE and low-risk thrombophilia, antepartum prophylaxis is advised, and for those with prior VTE and high-risk thrombophilia, both antepartum and postpartum prophylaxis are recommended; I should confirm that these are conditional recommendations with shared decision-making given low certainty evidence [^115YePMy] [^111mNJyt] [^113Uning] [^111nDKpe].

> Hold on, I should verify the stance on asymptomatic relatives because overtesting is common. Routine screening of family members is not recommended; selective testing may be considered only when results would change reproductive or hormonal decisions, and even then, counseling should emphasize that heterozygous FVL alone rarely justifies lifelong anticoagulation and that absolute risks are modest outside high-risk contexts [^115FRymq] [^111srdxY] [^116Xar8P].

> Let me consider perioperative and lifestyle counseling so I don't miss practical risk modification. There is no evidence-based mandate for routine perioperative anticoagulation solely due to FVL; standard VTE prophylaxis protocols should be followed, with heightened vigilance for major orthopedic or abdominal surgery and in patients with additional risk factors; I should counsel on avoiding estrogen-containing contraception in those with prior VTE or strong family history, and on mobility, hydration, and weight management to mitigate acquired risks [^116Xar8P].

> I should double-check that my decision algorithm is concise and aligned with guidelines. Do not test at acute VTE onset or during initial anticoagulation; consider testing after completing at least 3 months of therapy in unprovoked VTE with family history, in unusual-site thrombosis, or in specific pregnancy scenarios; interpret positive results in the context of provocation status and bleeding risk; manage acute VTE per standard pathways; extend anticoagulation for unprovoked events when recurrence risk outweighs bleeding, with stronger consideration in homozygous FVL or combined thrombophilia; avoid routine family screening unless results would change reproductive or hormonal management [^115DEvFD] [^111chGNk] [^111ZSjF2].

> In summary, I need to ensure the key takeaways are explicit. Factor V Leiden increases VTE risk but rarely dictates a unique acute treatment; testing should be selective and timed off anticoagulation; management decisions hinge on whether the index event was provoked, the severity of thrombophilia, and patient-specific bleeding and preference considerations; and in pregnancy, homozygous FVL and combined thrombophilias shift the balance toward prophylaxis, whereas heterozygous FVL alone generally does not [^111A4HF3] [^115DEvFD] [^111Uhn6Z].

---

Factor V Leiden is a **common inherited thrombophilia** [^111A4HF3] that increases VTE risk, especially when combined with acquired risk factors [^111A4HF3]. Testing is indicated for unprovoked VTE, VTE at a young age, or a strong family history [^1127cwgG] [^115DEvFD], but not for routine screening or to guide acute management [^115DEvFD] [^113UAvw7]. Acute VTE is treated with standard anticoagulation [^111A4HF3]; duration is individualized, with extended therapy considered for unprovoked events or high-risk thrombophilia [^111ZSjF2]. Asymptomatic carriers do not need routine anticoagulation, but pregnancy and postpartum prophylaxis are recommended for homozygous FVL or combined thrombophilias [^111A4HF3] [^111mNJyt] [^113Uning]. Counseling on risk factors and family planning is essential [^113exsk6].

---

## Pathophysiology

Factor V Leiden results from a **G1691A substitution** in the F5 gene, causing APC resistance and increased thrombin generation [^111A4HF3]. Heterozygotes have a 3–8× increased VTE risk; homozygotes have a 50–100× increase [^notfound].

---

## Clinical manifestations

- **Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)**: Most common manifestation [^111A4HF3].
- **Pulmonary embolism (PE)**: Common complication of DVT [^111A4HF3].
- **Unusual site thrombosis**: Cerebral, mesenteric, or portal veins [^111A4HF3].
- **Pregnancy complications**: Increased risk of miscarriage, preeclampsia, and placental abruption [^111A4HF3].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

### Indications for testing

Testing is indicated in the following scenarios:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Indication for testing** |
|-|-|
| Unprovoked VTE | Yes [^1127cwgG] |
| VTE at age < 50 years | Yes [^115DEvFD] |
| Strong family history of VTE | Yes [^1127cwgG] |
| Recurrent VTE | Yes [^115DEvFD] |
| Routine screening | No [^115DEvFD] |
| Acute VTE management | No [^111chGNk] |

---

### Testing methods

- **Activated protein C resistance (APCR) assay**: Screening test; confirm with genetic testing [^111A4HF3].
- **Genetic testing**: PCR-based methods to detect the F5 mutation [^111A4HF3].
- **Timing**: Perform off anticoagulation for ≥ 2 weeks to avoid false negatives [^notfound].

---

## Management of acute venous thromboembolism (VTE)

Standard anticoagulation with **LMWH, DOACs, or warfarin** is used [^notfound]. Duration is typically 3–6 months, individualized to recurrence and bleeding risk [^117L7tse]. Extended therapy is considered for unprovoked VTE or high-risk thrombophilia (e.g. homozygous FVL) [^111ZSjF2].

---

## Management of asymptomatic carriers

Asymptomatic carriers **do not require routine anticoagulation** [^111A4HF3]. Management is risk-factor modification and counseling [^113exsk6]. Consider prophylaxis in high-risk situations (e.g. surgery, immobilization, pregnancy) [^111A4HF3].

---

## Management in pregnancy

- **Antepartum prophylaxis**: Recommended for homozygous FVL or combined thrombophilias, regardless of family history [^111mNJyt] [^113KjcQd].
- **Postpartum prophylaxis**: Recommended for 6 weeks in homozygous FVL or combined thrombophilias [^113Uning] [^112gMR7p].
- **Heterozygous FVL**: No routine antepartum prophylaxis unless additional risk factors [^115YePMy] [^111Uhn6Z].

---

## Family counseling and genetic testing

Counsel on **autosomal dominant inheritance** and variable penetrance [^111A4HF3]. Test first-degree relatives when results will alter management (e.g. pregnancy, surgery) [^116Xar8P]. Avoid routine screening of asymptomatic relatives [^115FRymq].

---

## Special considerations

- **Perioperative management**: Standard prophylaxis; no routine intensification for FVL alone [^notfound].
- **Hormonal therapy**: Avoid estrogen-containing contraceptives in high-risk patients [^notfound].
- **Lifestyle modifications**: Weight management, smoking cessation, and activity promotion [^notfound].

---

Factor V Leiden increases VTE risk; management is **individualized**, with testing reserved for select scenarios and anticoagulation tailored to risk. Counseling and risk-factor modification are key, especially in pregnancy and family planning [^111A4HF3].

### Management of thrombophilia [^112fM3Kq]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2003). Low credibility.

It is now possible to identify acquired and hereditary risk factors in a substantial percentage of patients presenting with a venous thrombotic event. Discovery of the factor V Leiden and prothrombin G20210A mutations has greatly increased the percentage of patients in whom venous thrombosis can be attributed to hereditary thrombophilia. There is, however, considerable uncertainty as to how this information should be used in patient management. Although prolonged anticoagulation at an international normalized ratio of 2–3 is highly effective in preventing thrombotic recurrences, this benefit is partially offset by major bleeding which occurs at an average rate of 2%-3% per year. A decision as to the overall benefit of extended anticoagulation in the individual patient requires assessment of the risk of recurrence in the absence of treatment vs. the bleeding risk associated with prolonged anticoagulation. Low-intensity warfarin therapy or novel anticoagulants such as oral direct thrombin inhibitors may prove effective strategies for preventing recurrent venous thromboembolism in patients with thrombophilia.

### Factor V Leiden thrombophilia [^111A4HF3]. Genetics in Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Factor V Leiden is a genetic disorder characterized by a poor anticoagulant response to activated Protein C and an increased risk for venous thromboembolism. Deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism are the most common manifestations, but thrombosis in unusual locations also occurs. The current evidence suggests that the mutation has at most a modest effect on recurrence risk after initial treatment of a first venous thromboembolism. Factor V Leiden is also associated with a 2- to 3-fold increased relative risk for pregnancy loss and possibly other obstetric complications, although the probability of a successful pregnancy outcome is high. The clinical expression of Factor V Leiden is influenced by the number of Factor V Leiden alleles, coexisting genetic and acquired thrombophilic disorders, and circumstantial risk factors. Diagnosis requires the activated Protein C resistance assay (a coagulation screening test) or DNA analysis of the F5 gene, which encodes the Factor V protein. The first acute thrombosis is treated according to standard guidelines. Decisions regarding the optimal duration of anticoagulation are based on an individualized assessment of the risks for venous thromboembolism recurrence and anticoagulant-related bleeding. In the absence of a history of thrombosis, long-term anticoagulation is not routinely recommended for asymptomatic Factor V Leiden heterozygotes, although prophylactic anticoagulation may be considered in high-risk clinical settings. In the absence of evidence that early diagnosis reduces morbidity or mortality, decisions regarding testing at-risk family members should be made on an individual basis.

### The thrombophilias: well-defined risk factors with uncertain therapeutic implications [^114ojSVz]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Discovery of the factor V Leiden and prothrombin G20210A mutations has greatly increased the percentage of patients in whom venous thrombosis can be attributed to hereditary thrombophilia. The first step in the diagnostic approach to all patients with venous thrombosis consists of a careful history and physical examination combined with routine laboratory testing to characterize the severity of the thrombotic condition and determine the presence of any of the acquired causes of hypercoagulability. The second step is to consider screening for the causes of hereditary and acquired thrombophilia in selected subsets of patients. The selection of patients for testing, the choice of tests to perform, and the timing of the testing are important and challenging issues to consider. Routine testing would be warranted if the identification of abnormalities led to an alteration in the type or duration of initial anticoagulant therapy or the use of long-term prophylactic anticoagulation. The available data, however, do not yet indicate that most patients with defined thrombophilic states should be managed any differently than patients without identifiable abnormalities. On the basis of relative prevalences of the various thrombophilias, patients can be classified as "strongly" or "weakly" thrombophilic depending on their thrombotic histories. Management considerations and guidelines are offered for patients who are found to have one or more defined abnormalities, hereditary or otherwise. The future identification of additional laboratory abnormalities predisposing patients to thrombosis, coupled with prospective clinical trials, should enable us to better identify patients at high risk for recurrence who will benefit from prolonged anticoagulant prophylaxis.

### Clinical utility of factor V Leiden (R506Q) testing for the diagnosis and management of thromboembolic disorders [^115LY8XF]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the current state of the art regarding the role of the clinical laboratory in diagnostic testing for the factor V Leiden (FVL) thrombophilic mutation (and other protein C resistance disorders), and to generate, through literature reviews and opinions of recognized thought-leaders, expert consensus recommendations on methodology and diagnostic, prognostic, and management issues pertaining to clinical FVL testing.

Data Sources, Extraction, and Synthesis

An initial thorough review of the medical literature and of current best clinical practices by a panel of 4 experts followed by a consensus conference review, editing, and ultimate approval by the majority of a panel of 28 additional coagulation laboratory experts.

Conclusions

Consensus recommendations were generated for topics of direct clinical relevance, including (1) defining those patients (and family members) who should (and should not) be tested for FVL; (2) defining the preferred FVL laboratory testing methods; and (3) defining the therapeutic, prophylactic, and management ramifications of FVL testing in affected individuals and their family members. As FVL is currently the most common recognized familial thrombophilia, it is hoped that these recommendations will assist laboratorians and clinicians caring for patients (and families) with this common mutation.

### FVL | Recommendations | EGAPP… [^113UAvw7]. archive.cdc.gov (2018). Low credibility.

Routine testing for Factor V Leiden and prothrombin mutations in adults with a history of idiopathic venous thromboembolism and their adult family members. Factor V Leiden and prothrombin genetic variants are associated with an increased risk of future venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. Idiopathic venous thromboembolism includes deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, and in the context of the EGAPP recommendation, refers to thrombotic events in which no underlying cause is apparent. EGAPP Recommendation Statement: The EGAPP™ Working Group found adequate evidence to recommend against routine testing for Factor V Leiden and/or prothrombin 20210G > A in the following circumstances: adults with idiopathic venous thromboembolism.

Key Questions: Question 1: Does FVL testing, alone or in combination with prothrombin G20210A testing, lead to improved clinical outcomes in adults with a personal history of VTE or to improved clinical outcomes in adult family members of mutation-positive individuals. Are testing results useful in medical, personal, or public health decision making. Question 4a: What is the evidence that clinicians manage patients differently based on the results of testing for FVL or prothrombin G20210A. How do clinicians manage anticoagulation of individuals who have had testing, as compared to those who have not had testing. What other diagnostic tests do clinicians order or not order, based on testing results. What recommendations do clinicians make regarding other therapies and exposures, based on testing results.

Question 4b: What is the evidence that testing, and the resultant management, reduces VTE related outcomes or has other benefits in individuals who have had VTE or in the probands' family members who have been tested. Question 4c: What is the evidence of harms to individuals with VTE or to the probands' family members who are tested for FVL or prothrombin G20210A as a result of testing or as a result of changed management based on the test results.

### Clinical and laboratory management of the prothrombin G20210A mutation [^115B6Jyi]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To make recommendations regarding the appropriate evaluation for the prothrombin G20210A mutation, as reflected by published evidence and the consensus opinion of recognized experts in the field. DAT SOURCES: Review of the medical literature, primarily since 1996.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

After an initial assessment of the literature, key points defining the condition, and review of the clinical study design, a draft manuscript was prepared and circulated to every participant in the College of American Pathologists Conference on Diagnostic Issues in Thrombophilia before the meeting. Each of the key points and associated recommendations were then presented for discussion at the conference. Recommendations were accepted if a consensus of 70% of experts attending the conference was reached. The results of the discussion were used to revise the manuscript into its final form.

Conclusions

Consensus was reached on several recommendations concerning the criteria for testing for the prothrombin G20210A mutation and for the method of testing. First, a major point of consensus was that the prothrombin G20210A mutation is a significant risk factor for venous thromboembolism (VTE) and that testing should be considered in the initial evaluation of suspected inherited thrombophilia. Second, although several analytic methods are commonly used for genetic testing for the prothrombin mutation, all are generally robust and reliable. The recommendations for testing for the prothrombin mutation parallel those for the factor V Leiden mutation and include patients with a history of recurrent VTE, a first episode of VTE before the age of 50 years, a history of an unprovoked VTE at any age, thromboses in unusual anatomic sites, or an affected first-degree relative with VTE. A history of VTE related to pregnancy or estrogen use and unexplained pregnancy loss during the second or third trimesters were also considered to be indications for testing. Other scenarios remain controversial or not recommended, including general population screening.

### Factor V Leiden and perioperative risk [^11285KBk]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2004). Low credibility.

Factor V Leiden (FVL) is the most common known inherited cause of thrombophilia; it is present in approximately 5% of the Caucasian population. Although the risk of venous thrombosis associated with this polymorphism in various medical settings is well described, its effect on perioperative risk is only beginning to be explored. Specifically, there are few studies addressing the potential risks of FVL in the surgical population, in which both hemorrhagic and thrombotic complications convey substantial clinical and economic significance. There are speculations and unproven hypotheses regarding FVL in this population, and these therefore highlight the need to comprehensively address this issue. This review will describe the physiology of the FVL mutation, briefly clarify its risk in the nonsurgical setting, and assess current data regarding FVL in noncardiac and cardiac surgery. Finally, a summary of current clinical evidence and a plan for more detailed investigation of this potentially significant risk factor will be proposed.

### Thrombophilia testing: a British Society for Haematology guideline [^116esrBd]. British Journal of Haematology (2022). Medium credibility.

General guidelines on the role of thrombophilia testing

In situations where the clinical utility of testing is not clear, testing is clearly not mandatory (clinical utility is defined as the ability of a test to improve clinical outcome). It is important that patients are counselled in advance of any decision on whether or not to undertake testing. This should include discussion of the aims of testing and how it might alter management decisions.

What is the utility of identifying a heritable thrombophilic trait in a patient who has had a venous thrombotic event in modifying their future management or the management of asymptomatic family members?

The relative risk of thrombophilic traits for recurrent VTE is less than that for a first episode of thrombosis because the comparator group is different. Moreover, the risk is managed differently, and no clinical trials have been undertaken. There are conflicting data on the association of FVL and F2 G20210A variants with risk of recurrence in the overall population of patients with VTE. Observational data suggest that FVL Leiden but not F2 G20210A is associated with an increased risk of recurrence. However, in a study with of 354 consecutive patients aged ≥ 65 years with a first unprovoked VTE, 9.0% of patients had FVL and 3.7% had a F2 G20210A variant. After adjustment for age, sex, and periods of anticoagulation as a time‐varying covariate, at 3‐year follow up neither the FVL (HR 0.98; 95% CI: 0.35–2.77) nor the F2 G20210A mutation (HR 1.15; 95% CI: 0.25–5.19) was associated with recurrent venous thromboembolism compared to controls.

What is new in these ASH guidelines?

The contribution of these guidelines in the broader space of treatment and prevention of VTE is to ensure that a patient-centered, individualized approach is adopted whenever appropriate. Although establishing unbiased estimates of the effect of specific antithrombotic treatments requires large RCTs, the same trials often do not provide sufficiently granular evidence to optimize the choice of whom to treat. Ultimately, the goal is to reduce the number needed to treat as much as possible, thus avoiding treatment of those patients who will not benefit from treatment or denying treatment to those who will.

To accomplish this overarching goal of finding out whether thrombophilia testing could lead to better individualized treatment, we believe the value of testing is to drive subsequent treatment decisions. We have devised an approach to appraise the value of thrombophilia testing built on combining prevalence data (how likely it is for an individual to have thrombophilia), risk association data (how likely it is for an individual with or without thrombophilia to have an event), and measures of treatment effect (how many fewer VTEs and how many more bleeding events will result from treating patients with thrombophilia and not treating patients without thrombophilia). Thus, what our panel decided upon was the number of events prevented (or provoked) by adopting a personalized treatment approach for the patients with a positive result for thrombophilia in several clinical scenarios. Of note, we have included cost, feasibility, acceptability, and equity considerations in the process. We argue that this is the best approach to making an evidence-based decision on the appropriateness of thrombophilia testing until robust prospective observations (and maybe RCTs) confirm or contradict the results of our simulations.

### Hypercoagulability: too many tests, too much conflicting data [^111VcMQh]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2002). Low credibility.

It is now possible to identify hereditary and acquired risk factors in a substantial percentage of patients presenting with a venous thrombotic event. The clinician is faced with an ever-growing number of laboratory tests that can be ordered in such patients, and there is considerable uncertainty as to how this information should be utilized in patient management. Some have argued that widespread testing of thrombosis patients for prothrombotic abnormalities such as the factor V Leiden and prothrombin G20210A mutations has been prematurely adopted into clinical practice as there are few data that their identification leads to improved clinical outcomes. Dr. Rosendaal provides an overview of the epidemiology of venous thrombosis with an emphasis on hereditary and acquired risk factors. The presentation will include information obtained from properly designed case-control studies as well as family studies. While some have suggested treatment strategies for managing patients with hereditary thrombophilia with prior thrombotic events or for managing patients undergoing procedures associated with increased thrombotic risk, clinical decision making is complicated by the need to assess the risk of recurrence and the likely benefit of prolonged anticoagulation versus the associated bleeding risk. Drs. Bauer, Heit, and Rosendaal discuss their approaches to patient management. Case presentations are used to illustrate the impact of laboratory test results on decisions.

Summary of recommendations

For each of the clinical questions for patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE), the panel compared 2 scenarios: (a) thrombophilia testing and subsequent indefinite anticoagulation of only the individuals found to have the thrombophilia and (b) no thrombophilia testing and indefinite anticoagulation for all or none of the individuals, depending on the standard of care. For scenario "b" of not testing for thrombophilia, the recommendations provided by other ASH VTE guidelines were considered the standard of care. Other clinical scenarios considered thromboprophylaxis during risk episodes for VTE (ie, minor transient risk factors, pregnancy or the postpartum period, or cancer) or avoiding hormone treatment based on the outcome of thrombophilia testing. The comparison of testing vs not testing for thrombophilia included balancing the risk for first or recurrent VTE events, bleeding events, the cost and burden associated with both testing and anticoagulant treatment or thromboprophylaxis, and patient preferences. When the recommendation is to prolong treatment or provide thromboprophylaxis based on the outcome of thrombophilia testing, the user will refer to the recommendations of the other ASH VTE guidelines for treating and preventing VTE for specific details. The guideline panel considered the effect of performing a full thrombophilia panel (consisting of simultaneously testing for factor V Leiden [FVL], prothrombin 20210A gene mutation [PGM], deficiencies of antithrombin, protein C, or protein S, and antiphospholipid antibodies [APLAs]) compatible with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). When considering family testing, the panel only considered hereditary defects. Further details of the approach taken to balance events, costs, patient preferences, and other relevant considerations can be found in "Methods". Figure 1 provides a visual overview of all guideline questions that are covered in this guideline, and Table 1 provides a synopsis of all resulting recommendations.

Introduction

In families of patients with VTE, people often ask whether it is useful to test asymptomatic relatives for thrombophilia. As discussed in the "Introduction", the relevant question and aim of the current guideline is to assess whether thrombophilia testing and tailoring management to the test result would improve patient-important outcomes. For instance, should an asymptomatic relative with thrombophilia receive thromboprophylaxis during minor VTE-provoking risk episodes that generally do not require prophylaxis, such as immobility or minor injury, illness, or infection? For women, should their thrombophilia status affect choices about hormonal contraception or dictate a need for prophylaxis around pregnancy and the postpartum period? In addition, sometimes hereditary thrombophilia is known in a family without anyone having experienced VTE. Examples of such clinical scenarios are testing for thrombophilia in women with recurrent miscarriage or other pregnancy complications, in young patients with arterial thrombosis, or population testing. The question is whether asymptomatic relatives of someone known to have thrombophilia would benefit from thrombophilia testing.

### Does thrombophilia testing help in the clinical management of patients? [^117PxF2j]. British Journal of Haematology (2008). Low credibility.

Thrombophilia can be identified in about half of all patients presenting with venous thrombosis. Testing has increased tremendously for various indications, but whether the results of such tests help in the clinical management of patients has not been settled. Here, we review the most commonly tested thrombophilic abnormalities, i.e. protein C, protein S, and antithrombin deficiencies, the F5 R506Q (factor V Leiden) and F2 G20210A (prothrombin G20210A) mutations, and elevated levels of coagulation factor VIII, and their association with venous and arterial thrombosis as well as pregnancy complications. We conclude that testing for hereditary thrombophilia generally does not alter the clinical management of patients with venous or arterial thrombosis or pregnancy complications. Because testing for thrombophilia only serves limited purpose this should not be performed on a routine basis.

Normal results — genetic causes can only be identified in about 25% of White patients without a family history, and negative genetic testing results are unlikely to significantly reduce the recurrence risk derived from clinical and family history; patients' clinical management and implementation of a healthier lifestyle toward preventing recurrent VTE should not be altered because of a negative genetic testing result.

### Is thrombophilia testing useful? [^116DZmuf]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2011). Low credibility.

Thrombophilia is found in many patients presenting with venous thromboembolism (VTE). However, whether the results of such tests help in the clinical management of such patients has not been determined. Thrombophilia testing in asymptomatic relatives may be useful in families with antithrombin, protein C, or protein S deficiency or homozygosity for factor V Leiden, but is limited to women who intend to become pregnant or who would like to use oral contraceptives. Careful counseling with knowledge of absolute risks helps patients in making an informed decision in which their own preferences can be taken into account. Observational studies show that patients who have had VTE and have thrombophilia are at most at a slightly increased risk for recurrence. In an observational study, the risk of recurrent VTE in patients who had been tested for inherited thrombophilia was not lower than in patients who had not been tested. In the absence of trials comparing routine and prolonged anticoagulant treatment in patients testing positive for thrombophilia, testing for such defects to prolong anticoagulant therapy cannot be justified. Diagnosing antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) in women with recurrent miscarriage usually leads to treatment with aspirin and low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), although the evidence to support this treatment is limited. Because testing for thrombophilia serves a limited purpose, this test should not be performed on a routine basis.

### First episode and recurrent venous thromboembolism: who is identifiably at risk? [^1134f3pg]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Management of venous thromboembolism (VTE) has undergone a significant evolution in the past two decades. Two of the more common heritable thrombophilias were identified (Factor V Leiden and prothrombin 20210A gene mutation) in the early to mid-1990s. These and other inherited and acquired hypercoagulable conditions were found to place patients at higher risk for developing a first episode of VTE. However, their roles in development of recurrent VTE remain uncertain. More recently, other clinical risk factors that are associated with increased risk for VTE have been identified. This information has allowed physicians to stratify the type and duration of anticoagulation based not only on the presence of thrombophilias, but also on other clinical characteristics that increase risk for a first episode of and recurrent VTE.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 197: inherited thrombophilias in pregnancy [^111DLAcY]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

Anticoagulation prophylaxis in inherited thrombophilia — risk assessment and thresholds — states that all patients with inherited thrombophilias should undergo individualized risk assessment for venous thromboembolism (VTE), with algorithms to evaluate whether pregnant or postpartum women could benefit from anticoagulants; decisions are influenced by personal history of VTE, severity of thrombophilia, family history, and risk factors such as cesarean delivery, obesity, and prolonged immobility. There is poor consensus among existing guidelines on what constitutes "high-risk" or "lowrisk" thrombophilia. An expert consensus recommended prophylaxis if the risk of VTE was 3% or greater. A 2017 meta-analysis of 36 studies found that the absolute risk of VTE exceeded 3% only for women with antithrombin, protein C, and protein S deficiencies, or homozygosity for factor V Leiden, and the absolute risk for homozygous prothrombin gene mutation could not be assessed. In that meta-analysis, all women with these deficiencies also had a family history of VTE, and family history of thromboembolism increases pregnancy risk and may have contributed to the observed increased absolute risk.

### American Society of Hematology 2023 guidelines for management of venous thromboembolism: thrombophilia testing [^115DEvFD]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Hereditary and acquired thrombophilia are risk factors for venous thromboembolism (VTE). Whether testing helps guide management decisions is controversial. These evidence-based guidelines from the American Society of Hematology (ASH) intend to support decision making about thrombophilia testing. ASH formed a multidisciplinary guideline panel covering clinical and methodological expertise and minimizing bias from conflicts of interest. The McMaster University GRADE Centre provided logistical support, performed systematic reviews, and created evidence profiles and evidence-to-decision tables. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach (GRADE) was used. Recommendations were subject to public comment. The panel agreed on 23 recommendations regarding thrombophilia testing and associated management. Nearly all recommendations are based on very low certainty in the evidence due to modeling assumptions. The panel issued a strong recommendation against testing the general population before starting combined oral contraceptives (COCs) and conditional recommendations for thrombophilia testing in the following scenarios: (a) patients with VTE associated with nonsurgical major transient or hormonal risk factors; (b) patients with cerebral or splanchnic venous thrombosis, in settings where anticoagulation would otherwise be discontinued; (c) individuals with a family history of antithrombin, protein C, or protein S deficiency when considering thromboprophylaxis for minor provoking risk factors and for guidance to avoid COCs/hormone replacement therapy; (d) pregnant women with a family history of high-risk thrombophilia types; and (e) patients with cancer at low or intermediate risk of thrombosis and with a family history of VTE. For all other questions, the panel provided conditional recommendations against testing for thrombophilia.

Document review

In July 2021, the draft recommendations were made available on the ASH website for external review by stakeholders, including allied organizations, other medical professionals, patients, and the public. The content was published within a PDF file and within an online survey that included structured questions and fields for open comment. The survey was viewed 594 times and completed by 41 individuals. Three letters (or emails) were also received, including 1 letter signed by 75 individuals. The panel did not change the direction or strength of the recommendations; however, the panel revised supporting remarks and discussion. The panel then developed this guideline report, which was reviewed by the ASH Guideline Oversight Subcommittee in January 2023, approved by the Committee on Quality on 22 February 2023, and by the ASH officers on 1 March 2023, and then subjected to peer review.

How to use these guidelines

ASH guidelines are primarily intended to help clinicians make decisions about diagnostic strategies and associated management. Other purposes are to inform policy, education, and advocacy and to state future research needs. They may also be used by patients. These guidelines are not intended to serve or be construed as a standard of care. Clinicians must make decisions based on the clinical presentation of each individual patient, ideally through a shared process that considers the patient's values and preferences with respect to the anticipated outcomes of the chosen option. Decisions may be constrained by the realities of a specific clinical setting and local resources, including but not limited to institutional policies, time limitations, and the availability of treatments. These guidelines may not include all appropriate methods of care for the clinical scenarios described. As science advances and new evidence becomes available, recommendations may become outdated. Following these guidelines cannot guarantee successful outcomes. ASH does not warrant or guarantee any products described in these guidelines.

Statements about the underlying values and preferences as well as qualifying remarks accompanying each recommendation are its integral parts and serve to facilitate a more accurate interpretation. They should never be omitted when recommendations from these guidelines are quoted or translated. Implementation of the guidelines may be facilitated by clinical decision support tools available from ASH. The use of these guidelines is also facilitated by the links to the EtD frameworks and interactive summary-of-findings tables in each section.

### Duration of anticoagulation: applying the guidelines and beyond [^117L7tse]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2010). Low credibility.

Despite an improved understanding of the risk factors underlying venous thromboembolism (VTE), extensive clinical investigation, and detailed clinical guidelines, the decision to extend anticoagulation indefinitely for an individual patient with VTE is often problematic. Patients with VTE in association with major surgery, trauma, immobilization, or pregnancy are at relatively low risk of recurrence and generally do not require more than 3 to 6 months of anticoagulant therapy. For patients with a first unprovoked, or idiopathic, episode of VTE, an individualized approach should be taken in deciding on the duration of anticoagulation based on the patient's recurrence and bleeding risk, as well as their personal preference. Although the presence of genetic thrombophilic disorders (factor V Leiden and prothrombin G20210A gene mutations; deficiencies of antithrombin, protein C, and protein S) predispose patients to a first episode of VTE, there is inconsistent data on whether testing for these defects changes patient outcomes or should alter their management. In patients with a single unprovoked VTE, measurement of D-dimer several weeks following the completion of anticoagulant therapy appears useful in stratifying patients with a first unprovoked episode of VTE with regard to recurrence risk. Through a series of clinical vignettes, the utility of the laboratory in risk-stratifying patients with respect to recurrence risk will be discussed, along with decision making regarding the duration of anticoagulation. The potential impact of having a nonremovable inferior vena caval filter will also be addressed.

### American Society of Hematology 2023 guidelines for management of venous thromboembolism: thrombophilia testing [^111m3eUA]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

For patients with VTE provoked by surgery, the recommendation in this ASH guideline not to test for thrombophilia is consistent with those of others. Interestingly, the ASH Choosing Wisely guidance that aims to reduce inappropriate thrombophilia testing also states: "patients who experience VTE in the setting of a major transient risk factor but who have additional risk factors such as a positive family history or concurrent exposure to hormonal therapy, ASH recommends that such patients seek guidance from an expert in VTE", highlighting the need for the current guidelines.

For patients with VTE provoked by a nonsurgical major transient risk factor or VTE associated with COCs, HRT, pregnancy, or postpartum, the ASH guideline suggests testing patients for thrombophilia. These recommendations are new and may cause considerable discussion, as many currently view these VTE episodes as provoked and are generally inclined to use short-term anticoagulation for such patients. It is important to note, however, that most guidelines or guidance statements on thrombophilia testing do not distinguish between major and minor provoking risk factors, which current science suggests is appropriate. For example, the ASH VTE treatment guideline, which the thrombophilia panel has used to define clinical scenarios and standards of care, distinguishes between major and minor provoking risk factors for VTE. The role of thrombophilia in decisions to guide treatment duration was not discussed by that panel, as it was assigned to the ASH thrombophilia panel. The European Society of Cardiology guidelines for the diagnosis and management of acute PE developed in collaboration with the European Respiratory Society (ERS) (2019) also distinguish major and minor provoking risk factors for VTE to assess VTE recurrence risk and suggest "to test for high-risk thrombophilia (but not heterozygous FVL or PGM) in patients in whom VTE occurs at a young age (eg, aged < 50 years) and in the absence of an otherwise identifiable risk factor, especially when this occurs against the background of a strong family history of VTE, as these are often candidates for indefinite anticoagulant treatment after a first episode of PE occurring in the absence of a major reversible risk factor". In summary, the suggestions to consider thrombophilia testing in deciding on the duration of VTE treatment after a nonsurgical risk factor may appear counterintuitive to some, but in fact are in line with considerations mentioned in other guidelines or guidance statements. It has to be noted that, to our knowledge, the ASH recommendations are the first to have formally used a rigorous modeling approach to assess the effect of thrombophilia testing for patients with VTE provoked by a nonsurgical major transient risk factor, supporting with quantitative and comprehensive considerations the suggestion of testing and the consequent indefinite duration of anticoagulation for the patients found to be positive and therefore at higher risk.

### Practical guide to management after an acute pulmonary embolism [^116f8V9x]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

Heritable thrombophilia

It is not recommended to test for heritable thrombophilia in most patients with a first VTE/PE. However, there are select patient populations in which testing is indicated:

Patients with unfractionated heparin/low molecular weight heparin resistance should be tested for antithrombin deficiency.
Patients with skin necrosis associated with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) should be tested for protein C and S deficiency.

Similarly, case finding among asymptomatic relatives of patients with a history of VTE is not recommended in most cases, as the annual risk of thrombosis in family members is low. It is not indicated in asymptomatic relatives of those with low risk thrombophilia (such as factor V Leiden) and, in high risk thrombophilia (such as antithrombin deficiency or protein C or S deficiency), case finding should only be considered in families who are prone to thrombosis (one first-degree or two second-degree relatives with VTE).

In those with confirmed deficiency of antithrombin, protein C or protein S, and patients with homozygous factor V Leiden or homozygous prothrombin G20210A mutation, long-term anticoagulation should be considered after a first episode of PE occurring in the absence of a major reversible risk factor. The 2019 ESC guidelines on management of acute PE advise that testing for thrombophilia may also be considered in patients whose PE occurs at a relatively young age (< 50 years) in the absence of any provoking risk factors, particularly if they have a strong family history of VTE, as testing in these patients may be helpful for treatment decisions. However, it is important to note that thrombophilia testing should not be routinely conducted for unselected patients in order to inform decisions on the duration of anticoagulant treatment; rather, these decisions should be based on the presence or absence of a provoking risk factor for VTE/PE and the risk of bleeding during treatment.

### Use of factor V Leiden genetic testing in practice and impact on management [^11176zhT]. Genetics in Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

To assess the use of the genetic test for Factor V Leiden in clinical practice, physician adherence to national and local guidelines, and impacts of test results on patient management.

Methods

Chart review of all patients tested for Factor V Leiden during a 1-year period (2003) in a large nonprofit health care system (group health) (n = 272).

Results

The test for Factor V Leiden was most often used in nonacute outpatient settings by primary care practitioners, in combination with other tests for procoagulant disorders. Testing was performed more broadly than recommended: 61% of tests met American College of Medical Genetics guidelines, 46% of tests met CAP guidelines, and 37% of tests met group health internal guidelines. The most common rationale for testing was to explain a clinical event (58%). Patient management was modified more often in heterozygotes (54%) than in those with normal results (13%) (P < 0.0001).

Conclusions

The uptake of the test for Factor V Leiden has not followed existing recommendations. Genetic risk information was used to influence patient management in the absence of supporting evidence related to health outcomes. These results underscore the importance of further research concerning effective prevention and treatment strategies for patients with genetic risk to help translate genetic risk information into improved health outcomes.

Implications for practice and research of these guidelines

Our work has several implications for practice and research. First, for the practicing clinician and for patients, our guideline suggests that shared decision making, covering the pros and cons and the practical implications of thrombophilia testing and the adoption of the associated VTE prevention strategies, may improve the quality of care for individuals with increased risk of clotting events, particularly so if they are at high risk of bleeding or have an indication or preference for hormonal therapy. Implementation of the guideline from this perspective will require educational tools and opportunities, which we strongly recommend being provided by scientific societies and patient organizations. Second, as pointed out many times in the guideline and for each recommendation, it is very critical that the proper thrombophilia tests are performed by high-quality clinical laboratories. Too often, thrombophilia testing includes tests with no supportive evidence, and too often the laboratory results are reported with insufficient details or interpretation. Training of physicians and laboratory medicine clinicians will be required for a positive impact of the proposed recommendations. Third, as the guidelines suggest against thrombophilia testing in many clinical scenarios, overdiagnosis may be decreased. Finally, more research is urgently needed. In particular, large implementation studies comparing the impact, in terms of outcome rates, among management strategies involving or not involving thrombophilia testing. This is a typical field where academically initiated guideline implementation studies might be warranted, as it is unlikely that this research will be sponsored by drug manufacturers because personalized medicine approaches often restrict the indication to pharmacological treatment. However, large organizations such as ASH might facilitate networks of independent researchers accessing public research funds to answer these burning questions.

### Society for perioperative assessment and quality improvement: a narrative review of best practices for perioperative management of patients with bleeding disorders [^116dcEfo]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Patients with bleeding disorders comprise a population at elevated risk of adverse events in the perioperative period. Patients might have been previously diagnosed with bleeding disorders or be suspected of having an underlying bleeding disorder. Because of the rarity of these diseases, perioperative management of these patients requires carefully orchestrated multidisciplinary care to prevent adverse outcomes. We present a practical and clinically relevant approach to patients with suspected and known inherited bleeding disorders. For patients with more common bleeding disorders such as von Willebrand disease (vWD), haemophilias, and factor deficiencies, we detail recommendations for perioperative laboratory evaluation and factor and blood product supplementation. We also provide an overview of the diagnosis and perioperative management of less common conditions such as inherited platelet function disorders and disorders of fibrinogen and fibrinolysis. We discuss best practices with regards to availability of specialist expertise and timely phlebotomy, laboratory, and pharmacy resources. A detailed and individualised plan coupled with close communication amongst the perioperative team will help improve care for patients with bleeding disorders undergoing surgery.

### Managing thromboembolic risk in patients with hereditary and acquired thrombophilias [^115U5eQn]. Blood (2020). Medium credibility.

While we are now able to diagnose inherited thrombophilias in a substantial number of patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE), the initial hope that their presence would inform recurrence risk and thus decisions on anticoagulation duration has largely been disappointing. Indeed, the presence or absence of transient provoking risk factors has proven to be the most important determinant of VTE recurrence risk. Thus, particular attention to transient acquired risk factors for VTE remains paramount, as they have generally been shown to carry more prognostic weight than inherited thrombophilias. The presence of other acquired risk factors may require additional management considerations, whether pertaining to anticoagulant choice, as in antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, or to addressing a new predisposing medical condition, as in malignancy. Antithrombin deficiency or the presence of ≥ 1 thrombophilic defect may be exceptions that can have a role in prognostication; however, as illustrated in this review through several case vignettes, interpretation and clinical application of the results of inherited thrombophilia testing is nuanced. We have chosen to focus on cases in which patients have been identified as having thrombophilic defects rather than the indications for undertaking testing in the first place or the extent of investigation. Management decisions in such cases ultimately hinge on individualized consideration of the benefits and risks of anticoagulation along with patient preference rather than on an algorithmic pathway based on thrombophilia status.

When should I investigate for cancer in a patient with VTE?

One in 20 patients who present with VTE is diagnosed with cancer within 12 months. The multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled 'screening for occult malignancy in patients with idiopathic venous thromboembolism' trial found that routine screening with CT scans of patients with a first unprovoked VTE did not result in a significant improvement in time to cancer diagnosis or cancer-related mortality versus limited occult cancer screening. Therefore, the updated 2020 National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines on the management of VTE do not recommend routine screening of cancer in patients with an unprovoked VTE. The decision on whether to investigate for cancer should be based on physical examination and medical history of symptoms, as described in the 2015 NICE guidelines for recognition and referral of suspected cancer. An interactive cancer screening tool is available from NICE. Age-specific and gender-specific testing (eg, mammography, cervical smear and prostate specific antigen testing) should be implemented in accordance with national guidelines and local practice. During follow-up after acute PE, the threshold to suspect cancer should be low in patients with a relatively recent history of cured cancer (eg, within 5 years, as VTE can be a sign of recurrent cancer), early VTE progression/recurrence despite anticoagulant treatment and anticoagulant-related bleeding shortly after start of treatment (particularly gastrointestinal bleeding or haematuria).

When should I test for thrombophilia?

Thrombophilia is defined as the increased tendency to form blood clots and there are heritable and acquired forms. Genetic causes of heritable thrombophilia include Factor V Leiden/prothrombin gene mutations, antithrombin deficiency and protein C and S deficiency. Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is the most common form of acquired thrombophilia.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) epidemiology — The incidence of VTE is approximately 1 to 1.5 per 1000 persons per year, and an individual's absolute lifetime risk is approximately 11%. Risk is age related, being approximately 1 in 10,000 persons per year before age 40 and increasing to 1 in 1000 persons per year after age 75. The clinical management of VTE costs the health care system an estimated $1.5 billion each year in the United States. The recurrence risk is approximately 20% within 5 years and 30% within 10 years after the first incidence, and it is estimated that one-third of VTE manifests as pulmonary embolism and two-thirds as other deep vein thromboses (DVTs).

### Thrombophilia testing: a British Society for Haematology guideline [^116Xar8P]. British Journal of Haematology (2022). Medium credibility.

For patients with a strong personal and/or family history of thrombosis in the absence of a clear risk factor, genetic analysis via Genomics England Limited (GEL) is available as noted above and should be combined with phenotypic testing where available. The likelihood of detecting a genetic trait increases with the strength of the family history.

The major heritable thrombophilic traits follow Mendelian inheritance albeit with variable penetrance. Levels of FVIII and FXI have clear genetic components but also significant acquired modifiers so the likelihood of relatives being affected is less certain. Identification of a heritable trait in a family member does not indicate a risk of thrombosis high enough to warrant anticoagulation and does not alter most thromboprophylaxis regimens. However, some guidelines include knowledge of heritable thrombophilic traits in their risk assessment schemes with a consequent impact on management. Absence of that trait in a family member significantly reduces their risk of thrombosis but does not return it to normal and the utility of testing will depend on their personal circumstances and the circumstances of the proband's VTE event. Overall, the recurrence risk for VTE is determined by the clinical situation (e.g. provoked vs. unprovoked) along with non‐Mendelian risk factors (e.g. body mass index and age) rather than the inherited thrombophilia panel. Therefore, when a patient is known to have a heritable thrombophilic trait, it may be reasonable to consider selective testing of first‐degree relatives when this will alter their management choices, for example, highly penetrant deficiencies of PC, PS or AT deficiency in a woman of childbearing age. Routine screening for FVL is not required in women with a first degree relative with FVL but no history of thrombosis (i.e. mother or siblings) prior to starting combined oral contraceptive pills or oestrogen replacement therapy. However, the influence of family history of thrombosis, thrombophilia testing and risk of thrombosis related oestrogen‐progesterone content of therapies should be discussed with all women to determine whether they will alter their therapy choices and should be documented clearly.

### Combined factor V Leiden and prothrombin genotyping in patients presenting with thromboembolic episodes [^113DDLoy]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Several genetic defects are associated with increased risk of venous thrombosis. The factor V Leiden (FVL) and prothrombin G20210A mutations are the most frequent causes of inherited thrombophilia.

Objectives

To evaluate combined genotyping for these 2 mutations in patients presenting with thromboembolic episodes and to correlate genotypic findings with clinical characteristics.

Results

Blood specimens were collected from 401 patients presenting with thromboembolic disease between January 1998 and September 1998, and genotyping for both FVL and prothrombin mutations was performed. Thirty-two patients (8%) were heterozygous for FVL, 4 (1%) were homozygous for FVL, and 20 (5%) were heterozygous for the prothrombin mutation. Two cases (0.5%) were identified with combined FVL and prothrombin mutations. The most common clinical presentation was lower-extremity deep vein thrombosis with or without pulmonary embolism. Arterial events were rare. The thromboembolic episodes were often precipitated by additional risk factors. Recurrent disease was found in 73.9% of FVL carriers and 52.9% of prothrombin mutation carriers; 52% of the patients with FVL and 50% of prothrombin mutation carriers had a first thrombotic episode before age 45 years. The 2 cases with combined genetic defects demonstrate amplified thrombotic risk. In the first case this was effected in thrombosis at a young age, and recurrence of thrombotic events even in the absence of precipitating factors. A complex interplay between genetic and additional risk factors was seen in the second case.

Conclusions

Identification of both FVL and prothrombin mutations is important in the overall assessment and management of patients with thrombophilia. Detection of these mutations can identify patients at high risk and help evaluate the interaction of genetic and acquired risk factors.

The pooled data did not confirm or exclude a beneficial or detrimental effect of aspirin relative to LMWH on symptomatic deep vein thrombosis (relative risk, 1.23; 95% CI: 0.49–3.08). The appraisal resulted in very low-certainty evidence.

Table 3.
SAVED risk assessment model.

Box 1. Recommendations regarding thrombo-hemorrhagic risk factors and risk stratification in patients with multiple myeloma.

All patients with multiple myeloma who are candidates for active anti-myeloma treatment need evaluation for risk of thrombosis in order to prevent thromboembolic complications appropriately.
Patient-, disease- and treatment-related factors should be evaluated.
Patient-related factors include advanced age, personal and family history of venous thromboembolism, obesity, immobility, central venous catheter, acute infection or hospitalization, comorbidities, race (being Caucasian is a risk factor), recent surgery, and ongoing hormone therapy.
There is no evidence to recommend universal laboratory testing for inherited thrombophilia. However, in the presence of a strong family history of venous thromboembolism, i.e. with one first-degree relative < 50 years with one episode of venous thromboembolism or two first-degree relatives with one episode of venous thromboembolism, laboratory investigation for genetic thrombophilia should be considered, i.e. deficiency of antithrombin, protein C, protein S, factor V Leiden mutation, prothrombin G20210A mutation.
Disease-related factors include: active multiple myeloma, evidence of hyperviscosity, pathological fracture of the pelvis, femur or spine conditioning immobilization or requiring surgery.
Treatment-related factors include immunomodulatory drugs, especially in combination with high-dose dexamethasone, multiagent chemotherapy, or exposure to erythropoietin-stimulating agents.
Even though risk assessment models such as the International Myeloma Working Group model and the IMPEDE and SAVED scores were validated for use in clinical prospective studies, the panel of experts agreed that there are not sufcient data to recommend one specific risk assessment model in clinical practice. The panel recommended that application of a risk assessment model should be consistent in a single center for all the patients.
Besides thrombotic risk, it is recommended that bleeding risk is also assessed before anti-myeloma therapy is started. An accurate history should be collected from the patient and bleeding history investigated; prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, platelet count and fibrinogen level should be evaluated.
Patients with alterations of first-line diagnostic tests indicative of a bleeding predisposition, or with a history of bleeding should be carefully evaluated by second-line diagnostic tests in cooperation with an expert in coagulation.

### American Society of Hematology 2023 guidelines for management of venous thromboembolism: thrombophilia testing [^1138hsiC]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Some of these recommendations introduce the potential for change in clinical practice and therefore deserve some additional consideration. First, the recommendations are all conditional, based mostly on patient preferences and values attached to relevant outcomes. We do acknowledge that conditional recommendations might be less appealing than strong ones to be applied to most patients and that applying conditional recommendations will require the education of patients and physicians to effectively elicit those preferences and appropriately use them for shared decision making. However, risk stratification is necessary to accomplish individualized optimal treatment, which makes our panel stand behind the present deliberations. Second, some of the recommendations may appear counterintuitive: for example, one may feel that it is inappropriate to test young people with COC-related VTE or patients with VTE provoked by transient nonsurgical risk factors, as their risk is generally considered too low for them to be candidates for lifelong treatment if they have thrombophilia. Against this uneasiness, we invite the reader to consider how reluctant one can be to treat a young patient with unprovoked VTE for life. These patients are not the majority of people enrolled in clinical trials, so we have little direct evidence about the need to treat them for life, yet that is the recommended approach. Furthermore, one would realize that cases of VTE related to COCs or nonsurgical risk factors are relatively few compared with the many more exposed to the same risk factors, and it is likely that a fraction of them might have a relevant provoking cofactor represented by thrombophilia. Others might be worried by the cost associated with testing for thrombophilia; for them, we note that irrespective of whether thrombophilia testing results will be used to start or withhold treatment, the cost of testing is negligible compared with the cost of lifelong anticoagulation (which we considered in our process), likely even after including indirect costs stemming from the treatment of additional events in untreated patients (which we did not consider). Finally, someone might be confused by having "divergent" recommendations for the same condition (thrombosis at unusual sites) depending on the standard of care adopted in a specific setting, whereby testing for thrombophilia is recommended to prolong treatment where the standard of care is short-term treatment duration and not recommended when the standard of care is long-term treatment for everyone. Under the perspective of choosing the best management option for patients with thrombophilia, patients with thrombophilia will indeed receive indefinite treatment because of both recommendations (because of testing in 1 case and regardless of testing in the other). Again, this is the result of a robust, pragmatic, and logical process that assessed the value of testing within the context in which the results of testing will be used.

Venous thromboembolism in pregnancy — benefits and baseline antepartum risk in thrombophilias are quantified as follows: thrombophilic women have higher antepartum VTE risk than the general population (approximately 0.6 of every 1000 deliveries). In women with a family history of VTE, pooled risks include heterozygosity for the factor V Leiden mutation (0.50%; 95% CI, 0.06%-1.21%), heterozygosity for the prothrombin gene mutation (0%; 95% CI, 0.0%-0.78%), and antithrombin deficiency (0.0%; 95% CI, 0%-2.35%), whereas antithrombin deficiency with a family history had higher risk (2.70%; 95% CI, 0%-8.53%). For homozygous factor V Leiden, risks ranged from 1.0% to 7.0%, and a meta-analysis of family studies suggested 6.86% (95% CI, 1.04%-15.83%); for homozygous prothrombin gene mutation, case-control data suggested 1.6%. Combined thrombophilias showed 2.8% in case-control studies and 0.95% (95% CI, 0%-3.25%) in two very small family studies. In pooled analyses of prophylactic low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) for placenta-mediated pregnancy complications, none of the women with thrombophilias in the control arm were diagnosed with VTE; in the absence of randomized studies, the guideline notes that the risk reduction with prophylaxis would be ~75%, while stating overall low certainty in these benefit estimates.

Recommendation 13

For individuals with a family history of VTE and unknown thrombophilia status in the family who have a minor provoking risk factor for VTE (eg, immobility or minor injury, illness, or infection), the ASH guideline panel suggests not testing for all hereditary thrombophilias (using a panel of tests) to guide thromboprophylaxis (conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence about effects ⊕○○○).

Remarks:

- Thrombophilia testing may be considered if individuals have multiple family members with VTE, if the family member with VTE was young, with patient preference, and in settings where testing incurs a low cost.
- A positive family history is defined as having a first- or second-degree relative with VTE.
- A strategy with testing for hereditary thrombophilia (using a panel of tests) would mean that individuals with thrombophilia receive thromboprophylaxis for a minor provoking risk factor, and individuals without thrombophilia would receive no thromboprophylaxis.
- These recommendations have not considered the possibility of finding homozygous defects or combinations of thrombophilia types in an individual with a positive family history of VTE and an unknown thrombophilia status.

Summary of the evidence

We did not identify direct studies to answer this question. The effect of thrombophilia testing and a subsequent strategy of providing thromboprophylaxis to individuals with thrombophilia and not to individuals without thrombophilia during risk situations was indirectly calculated using separate observational studies for thrombophilia prevalence in patients with VTE and unknown thrombophilia status (Table 3), and subsequently dividing this prevalence depending on the relationship to the proband (ie, 50% in individuals with a first-degree family history and 25% in individuals with a second-degree family history). We used RRs for a first event in individuals with thrombophilia vs individuals without thrombophilia and RCT evidence for the effect of thromboprophylaxis, as detailed in Table 4.

The risk for a first VTE during minor risk episodes was estimated at 12 per 1000, based on 6 observational studies. We estimated the overall risk of major bleeding at 4 per 1000 based on the estimates from the VTE prophylaxis in medical outpatients with minor provoking risk factors for VTE (eg, immobility, minor injury, illness, infection).

Pregnancy-associated VTE risk assessment and genetic testing — FVL and factor II c.✱97G > A have been detected in approximately 40% and 17% of VTE cases, respectively, during pregnancy, and ACOG and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine recommend that every pregnant individual requires an assessment for VTE risk, with the first and second most significant individual risk factors being prior thrombosis and known thrombophilia. The risk of VTE in heterozygous patients without a personal history or affected first-degree relative(s) is only minimally increased compared with the general population, and a comprehensive investigation of a patient's personal and family history of thrombosis and individual risk assessment is recommended before the initiation of genetic testing. Screening for an FVL variant and factor II c.✱97G > A variant is not recommended for individuals with a history of fetal loss or adverse pregnancy outcomes without a personal history of VTE or a family history of thrombus due to insufficient clinical evidence; for individuals with a known genotype, some professional organizations recommend prophylactic treatment to prevent VTE for homozygotes and double heterozygotes.

### Inherited thrombophilia: a double-edged sword [^113pgqUb]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2016). Low credibility.

Inherited thrombophilia is a blood coagulation disorder that increases the risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE). During the last decades, the practice of testing has evolved from testing selected populations, leading to high perceived risks, to broad testing for various conditions that included VTE, arterial thrombosis, and pregnancy complications. Because results of such tests usually do not guide treatment decisions, not testing patients with VTE for inherited thrombophilia is on the "Choosing Wisely" list endorsed by multiple specialty societies, including ASH. Inherited thrombophilia can be regarded a double-edged sword, as despite the rationale not to test, it is still being performed frequently. Another way of seeing inherited thrombophilia as a double-edged sword lies in its 2-sided association with reproduction, both in men and in women. Current areas of research are whether women with inherited thrombophilia and pregnancy complications benefit from anticoagulant therapy with regard to improving the chance of a successful pregnancy. Potential effects of inherited thrombophilia, most notably factor V Leiden, on improved embryo implantation in women and sperm counts in men are intriguing, but are currently poorly understood.

Summary of the evidence

We did not identify direct studies to answer these questions. The effect of selective thrombophilia testing (recommendation 11) and a subsequent strategy of providing thromboprophylaxis to individuals with thrombophilia and not to individuals without thrombophilia during risk situations was indirectly calculated using the known thrombophilia prevalence in families (ie, 50% in individuals with a first-degree family history of VTE, and 25% in individuals with a second-degree family history of VTE), RRs for a first VTE event in individuals with thrombophilia vs individuals without thrombophilia based on 4 to 9 observational studies (depending on the thrombophilia type), and the effect of thromboprophylaxis on VTE and major bleeding based on 4 RCTs (summary in Table 4). We did not provide formal recommendations for individuals with a family history of VTE and known homozygous FVL or a combination of hereditary thrombophilia types. For individuals with a homozygous first-degree relative, the prevalence of thrombophilia would be 100%. This prevalence would be lower for second-degree relatives and for individuals with first-degree relatives with varying combinations of thrombophilia types. Furthermore, there is a lack of evidence regarding VTE risk with various combinations of hereditary thrombophilia. Therefore, we were unable to perform adequate modeling and calculations.

Table 4.
Estimates used to calculate effect of thrombophilia testing in individuals with a family history of VTE

For individuals with a first-degree family history of VTE and a specific thrombophilia, the risk for a first VTE during minor risk episodes was estimated at 15 per 1000 for a family history of FVL or the PGM and 50 per 1000 for a family history of antithrombin deficiency, protein C deficiency, or protein S deficiency, based on 6 observational studies. We estimated the overall risk of major bleeding at 4 per 1000 patients, based on the estimates from the ASH VTE guidelines recommendation on prophylaxis in medical outpatients with minor provoking risk factors for VTE (eg, immobility, minor injury, illness, infection).

For recommendation 12, the data and assumptions were the same, with the assumption that additional hereditary thrombophilia types would be identified with the same frequency as in the general population.

### Thrombophilia testing: a British Society for Haematology guideline [^114HuRft]. British Journal of Haematology (2022). Medium credibility.

Leiden, prothrombin gene variant and other genetic variants (except, anddeficiency) and risk of thrombosis

The FVL and F2 G20210A variants are the most commonly tested genetic variants predisposing to VTE. These are detected using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)‐based methods. Their prevalence varies in populations of different ethnicity. For example, heterozygosity for FVL is present in about 5% of individuals of European descent but is rare or absent in peoples from sub‐Saharan Africa, East Asia and indigenous populations of the Americas and Australia. Similarly, heterozygosity for the prothrombin gene variant is present in 1%–2% of Europeans and is rare or absent in other ethnic populations.

The FVL variant abolishes a cleavage site for activated PC in factor V increasing procoagulant activity. The prothrombin gene variant is a point mutation (G20210A) in the 3′ untranslated region of the genecausing increased levels of prothrombin. These variants result in increased relative risks for first venous thrombosis of 5‐ and 3‐fold, respectively.

A large number of variants in other genes with a wide range of prevalences have been reported to confer an increased risk of thrombosis. These include variants of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), SERPINE1 (encoding plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1) (PAI‐1) and factor XIII as well as variants linked to the quantitative changes in procoagulant factors discussed above. However, either their association with thrombosis is not convincingly consistent or their effect is too small to alter management and they should not be included in thrombophilia panels at present. Although it has been shown that multiple variants present in an individual can combine to identify a significant risk of recurrence, this requires validation and we do not yet know how and when to introduce this oligogenic model into practice.

Recommendations

Genetic testing to predict a first episode of venous thrombosis is not recommended (Grade 2B).

The SOGC, ACCP, Australia/New Zealand, and ACOG guidelines "generally recommend against antepartum prophylaxis in women with a history of VTE related to a temporary nonhormonal risk factor", while the RCOG "recommends introduction of prophylaxis at 28 weeks in these women". SOGC, RCOG, Australia/New Zealand clinicians, and ACOG "favor prophylaxis throughout the antepartum period if the affected woman is known to carry a thrombophilia", and SOGC, RCOG, and ACCP "suggest against routine prophylaxis in women undergoing assisted reproduction but favor prophylaxis in those with severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome". The SOGC recommendation for "prophylactic- or intermediate-dose LMWH for 1 to 6 weeks" in select PE scenarios "is different from our recommendation". These guidelines also "recommend against antepartum prophylaxis to prevent a first VTE" in women with a family history of VTE who have antithrombin deficiency, differ from ACCP by "recommending antepartum prophylaxis" for women "who are homozygous for the factor V Leiden mutation or who have combined thrombophilias regardless of family history", and differ from RCOG/ACCP by recommending "against postpartum prophylaxis" for first-event prevention in women with a family history and "heterozygosity for either the factor V Leiden mutation or prothrombin gene mutation". For delivery planning, SOGC and ACCP "recommend a multidisciplinary discussion" for women receiving antepartum anticoagulants, and none of these guidelines "express a preference for scheduled or unscheduled delivery". The limitations of these guidelines are stated as "inherent in the low or very low certainty in the evidence", with "a lack of pregnancy-specific evidence" leading at times to reliance on studies in "nonpregnant patients".

### American Society of Hematology 2023 guidelines for management of venous thromboembolism: thrombophilia testing [^113kDbZF]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Remarks:

- A strategy with testing for hereditary thrombophilia (using a panel of tests) would mean that individuals with thrombophilia receive thromboprophylaxis or a minor provoking risk factor, and individuals without thrombophilia would receive no thromboprophylaxis.
- A positive family history is defined as having a first- or second-degree relative with VTE or thrombophilia.
- These recommendations do not address homozygous defects or combinations of thrombophilia types.
- This recommendation does not consider the time it takes to perform the test and is based on the assumption that thrombophilia test results are available at the time the individual is at risk for VTE because of a minor provoking risk factor.
- These recommendations refer to testing for all hereditary thrombophilias using a panel of tests. A separate question in this guideline addressed selective testing only for the known familial thrombophilia type in this population (recommendation 11), and the resulting recommendations are the same.
- It is most sensible to selectively test for the known familial thrombophilia (recommendation 11) rather than test for the entire panel (recommendation 12) because of the trivial additional number of VTE episodes prevented and major bleeds caused by a strategy of panel testing for all hereditary thrombophilias.

Recommendation strength interpretation notes that the strength of a recommendation is expressed as either strong ("the guideline panel recommends… ") or conditional ("the guideline panel suggests… ") and is interpreted so that for strong recommendations, most individuals in this situation would want the recommended course of action and only a small proportion would not, and most individuals should receive the intervention or test; for conditional recommendations, the majority of individuals in this situation would want the suggested course of action but many would not, and different choices will be appropriate for individual patients and clinicians must help each patient arrive at a management decision consistent with their individual risks, values, and preferences.

For women with a family history of VTE and thrombophilia, should selective thrombophilia testing be performed to guide the use of thromboprophylaxis during pregnancy?

Recommendation 21

For women with a family history of VTE and known homozygous FVL, a combination of FVL and PGM, or an antithrombin deficiency in the family, the ASH guideline panel suggests testing for the known familial thrombophilia. The panel suggests antepartum thromboprophylaxis for women with the same familial thrombophilia (ie, homozygous FVL, combination of FVL and PGM, or antithrombin deficiency) and no antepartum prophylaxis for women without the same familial thrombophilia (conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence about effects ⊕○○○).

For women with a family history of VTE and a known protein C or protein S deficiency in the family, the ASH guideline panel suggests either testing for the known familial thrombophilia or not testing for thrombophilia to guide antepartum prophylaxis (conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence about effects ⊕○○○).

Remarks:

- Pharmacological thromboprophylaxis based on antepartum thrombophilia testing is generally continued postpartum.
- Conditions can include the duration and burden of the treatment, which involves injections with low-molecular-weight heparin, and patient preference.
- A strategy with selective testing for the known familial thrombophilia type would mean that relatives with a positive result would receive thromboprophylaxis and relatives with a negative result would not receive thromboprophylaxis.
- A positive family history is defined as having a first- or second-degree relative with VTE; for homozygous FVL, these recommendations only concern siblings, not children, as these would most often be heterozygous for FVL; management of women with a second-degree family history was not addressed.
- These recommendations do not address heterozygous FVL or PGM alone, as the ASH guidelines on the management of VTE in the context of pregnancy suggest not using thromboprophylaxis for these women.

Regarding specific circumstances for deep vein thrombosis, more specifically with respect to pregnant patients (antepartum thromboprophylaxis), ASH 2023 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining testing for the known familial thrombophilia in females with a family history of VTE and known homozygous factor V Leiden, a combination of factor V Leiden and prothrombin G20210A, or antithrombin deficiency in the family. Consider administering antepartum thromboprophylaxis in patients with the same familial thrombophilia.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 197: inherited thrombophilias in pregnancy [^113KjcQd]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

ACOG Practice Bulletin No. 197 — Risk categorization and duration of pharmacologic prophylaxis states that, even without other risk factors, "women who are known to be homozygous for the factor V Leiden mutation or prothrombin gene mutation should receive pharmacologic prophylaxis during pregnancy and the postpartum period", and that "women with antithrombin deficiency and women who are heterozygous for factor V and the prothrombin gene mutation are considered high risk of VTE and should receive pharmacologic prophylaxis in the absence of other risk factors". For other lower risk thrombophilias, "Decision-making regarding the need for pharmacologic prophylaxis… is based on the presence or absence of other risk factors", and "Women deemed to require pharmacologic prophylaxis during pregnancy will typically continue anticoagulation for at least 6 weeks postpartum". Those with recurrent events or life-long indications "should receive adjusted-dose low-molecular-weight heparin throughout pregnancy with transition back to maintenance anticoagulation postpartum".

### Thrombophilia testing patterns amongst patients with acute venous thromboembolism [^114KSiba]. Thrombosis Research (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Thrombophilia testing has limited value in determining the selection and duration of anticoagulation therapy for venous thromboembolism (VTE), yet is commonly performed. This study describes the patterns and appropriateness of thrombophilia testing in a large cohort of patients with acute VTE.

Materials and Methods

This was a retrospective study of a random sample of patients with a validated diagnosis of acute VTE diagnosed between January 1, 2004 and December 31, 2010. Events were identified from administrative data and verified via manual review. Patients were grouped by thrombophilia testing status and compared on patient characteristics and thrombophilia testing results and appropriateness.

Results

Of 1314 patients with validated VTE, 315 (24%) underwent thrombophilia testing, 62 (20%) of whom had ≥ 1 positive test. Tested patients were younger and more likely to have had a family history of VTE. Factor V Leiden (17%) and prothrombin G20210A mutation (4%) were the most commonly detected thrombophilias. Only 31 (10%) of tested patients met eligibility criteria for thrombophilia testing (i.e., at least one strong thrombophilic risk factor present) and were tested at least 90 days following unprovoked index VTE.

Conclusions

Thrombophilia is commonly evaluated in patients without a clear indication for testing and during times where results may be unreliable. Future studies are needed to assess interventions aimed at reducing inappropriate thrombophilia testing without adversely affecting patient outcomes.

Guideline 3.6: Laboratory evaluation — We suggest laboratory evaluation for thrombophilia for patients with a history of recurrent venous thrombosis and chronic recurrent venous leg ulcers [GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - C]. Laboratory evaluation for thrombophilia should include testing for inherited hypercoagulable factors (antithrombin deficiency, protein C and protein S deficiencies), factor V Leiden (resulting in activated protein C resistance), prothrombin G20210A, plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 mutations, hyperhomocysteinemia, antiphospholipid antibodies (anticardiolipin and lupus anticoagulant), and cryoglobulins and cryoagglutinins.
