## Question

how to check prolapsed bladder

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to check for a prolapsed bladder, which in clinical terms is an anterior vaginal wall prolapse (cystocele). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core elements of history and symptom characterization. Then, I should verify the optimal physical examination technique, including position, bladder status, and POP-Q execution. Next, I will consider when and how to assess bladder function, especially postvoid residual and stress testing. After that, I need to check indications for ancillary tests like urodynamics, imaging, and cystoscopy. Finally, I will integrate special scenarios and synthesize a practical algorithm, making sure each step aligns with guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the key historical elements that raise suspicion for cystocele and guide the exam. The most specific symptom is a vaginal bulge that the patient can see or feel, often accompanied by pelvic pressure, urinary frequency or urgency, difficulty voiding with straining or positional dependence, and a sensation of incomplete emptying; I should also ask about stress incontinence, constipation, and sexual dysfunction, and I need to screen for vaginal bleeding to exclude malignancy or mucosal injury, since these features shape both the examination and management decisions [^8ca3b540] [^f3a64f94].

> Wait, let me verify the optimal examination setup before I proceed. The bladder should be empty because a full bladder can mask prolapse severity and distort anatomy, and the patient should be positioned upright or standing if feasible, as supine lithotomy tends to underestimate descent; if standing is not possible, left lateral decubitus can be an alternative, and I should repeat the exam with maximal Valsalva to reproduce the patient's worst symptoms, documenting the extent relative to the hymen [^927e7f6e] [^056625cd] [^2dca7224].

> I will now examine the external genitalia and then systematically inspect each compartment. Using a split-speculum technique, I isolate anterior, posterior, and apical segments to quantify descent, and I should look for vaginal mucosal changes such as keratinization or ulceration that suggest chronicity; I need to ensure the findings match the patient's reported bulge, and if they do not, I should reconsider position, bladder status, or repeat the exam to avoid underestimation [^927e7f6e] [^66d69fb5].

> Next, I should review POP-Q execution because objective quantification is essential. I need to measure points Aa and Ba for the anterior wall, Ap and Bp for the posterior wall, and C and D for the cervix or vault, along with genital hiatus, perineal body, and total vaginal length; staging is based on the most distal point, with stage 2 defined at the hymen, and I should confirm that my measurements reflect the patient's maximal descent on strain, not at rest, to avoid under-calling severity [^9eff8419] [^5346f8cd] [^bf140ab2].

> Hold on, I should verify bladder function next, especially if the prolapse extends beyond the hymen or if there are voiding symptoms. I need to check a postvoid residual by catheterization or bladder scan, and while cutoffs vary, many use less than 50 mL as normal and greater than 200 mL as abnormal; if PVR is elevated or voiding is abnormal, I should consider urodynamics, but I should double-check that a single elevated PVR is confirmed on a second occasion because transient factors can confound results [^7dd6c7df] [^5d505556] [^eff15461].

> Let me consider stress incontinence assessment, particularly to unmask occult stress urinary incontinence that can be hidden by the obstructing prolapse. I should perform a cough stress test with the bladder reasonably filled, ideally around 200–300 mL, and repeat it with the prolapse reduced using a speculum or pessary; a positive test with reduction predicts a meaningful risk of postoperative SUI, and I should document the results to inform surgical planning and counseling [^bb906a74] [^c6f1cc5c] [^d73dacad].

> But wait, what if the clinical picture is discordant or I need more detail for surgical planning. I should confirm indications for urodynamics: bothersome incontinence with stage II or greater prolapse, voiding dysfunction, or planning surgery where occult SUI would change management; I need to ensure the study includes stress testing with prolapse reduced to accurately detect occult SUI and detrusor dysfunction, recognizing that routine urodynamics for all POP patients is not supported and should be individualized [^5fe5c8c4] [^022c1de6] [^8592c1df].

> I should double-check the role of imaging because it is often overused. Imaging is not first-line for diagnosing POP; however, if the exam is inconclusive or if I need to characterize complex or multicompartment defects, dynamic MRI defecography or fluoroscopic cystocolpoproctography can be considered, with MRI offering multiplanar soft-tissue detail without radiation; endovaginal ultrasound has limited diagnostic value for POP itself and may be reserved for specific questions like mesh or sphincter assessment rather than routine POP diagnosis [^5737c0e4] [^3ac2fbee] [^140702d2].

> Next, I should review when cystoscopy is indicated. Intraoperative cystoscopy is recommended during anterior or apical prolapse repairs that risk bladder or ureteral injury to identify and immediately repair injuries, and I should confirm ureteral efflux with dye or indigo carmine when performing cystoscopy; this is a universal recommendation for procedures with significant lower urinary tract risk, not a routine office test [^5b3d523b] [^9893e291] [^1ab0f352].

> Let me think about special scenarios that can mimic or complicate cystocele. A ureterocele can prolapse through the urethra and present as a vaginal mass with incontinence, so if I see a fluctuant, mucosa-covered mass at the urethra, I should consider cystoscopy and imaging to avoid mislabeling it as anterior wall prolapse; similarly, in children or neonates, bladder prolapse through a patent urachus presents as an umbilical mass and requires prompt surgical consultation and imaging such as voiding cystography to confirm the diagnosis [^76dcec31] [^70b34826] [^ddc5ddc8].

> I should confirm that my documentation captures both objective and patient-centered outcomes. Recording POP-Q staging, PVR, and stress test results provides objective data, while validated patient-reported outcome measures like the PFDI-20 or APFQ capture bother and goals; this dual approach aligns with best practices and supports shared decision-making and longitudinal tracking of change [^50bd7d07] [^c6063dc0].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm and sanity-check each step. Start with a targeted history emphasizing bulge, urinary and bowel symptoms, and bleeding; perform a POP-Q exam with an empty bladder, preferably upright, with maximal Valsalva; assess PVR if prolapse is beyond the hymen or if voiding is abnormal; perform a cough stress test with adequate bladder volume and with prolapse reduced to evaluate occult SUI; consider urodynamics when incontinence or voiding dysfunction will change management; reserve imaging for equivocal exams or complex defects; and plan intraoperative cystoscopy when repairing anterior or apical compartments, ensuring each step is justified by symptoms and surgical intent [^bf140ab2] [^5fe5c8c4] [^9ee5e115].

To check for a prolapsed bladder (cystocele), start with a **focused history** of vaginal bulge, pressure, urinary symptoms, and bowel or sexual dysfunction [^8ca3b540], then perform a **pelvic exam** with the bladder empty, using the POP-Q system to quantify descent and stage severity [^bf140ab2] [^9eff8419]. Assess for **occult stress incontinence** with a cough stress test at ~200–300 mL, both with the prolapse in place and reduced [^c6f1cc5c] [^8592c1df]. Measure **postvoid residual** if the prolapse extends beyond the hymen or if voiding is abnormal [^7dd6c7df] [^5fe5c8c4]. Imaging is not routine but may be used if the exam is inconclusive or to define complex defects [^5737c0e4] [^3ac2fbee]. Reserve urodynamics for cases with mixed incontinence, voiding dysfunction, or when surgery is planned and occult SUI risk must be assessed [^5fe5c8c4] [^022c1de6].

---

## Clinical history

A thorough clinical history is essential to identify symptoms and risk factors associated with bladder prolapse. Key elements include:

- **Vaginal bulge or pressure**: The most specific symptom of prolapse [^8ca3b540].
- **Urinary symptoms**: Frequency, urgency, stress incontinence, difficulty voiding, or incomplete emptying [^8ca3b540].
- **Bowel symptoms**: Constipation, straining, or incomplete evacuation [^8ca3b540].
- **Sexual dysfunction**: Dyspareunia or decreased libido [^notfound].
- **Risk factors**: Vaginal childbirth, aging, obesity, chronic cough, constipation, or heavy lifting [^662d7797].

---

## Physical examination

Physical examination is the cornerstone of diagnosing bladder prolapse. The following steps are recommended:

- **Positioning**: Examine the patient in the lithotomy position; if prolapse is not evident supine, repeat in the standing position or use a birthing chair to maximize descent [^927e7f6e] [^056625cd].
- **Bladder status**: Ensure the bladder is empty to avoid underestimating prolapse severity [^f5f1cf56].
- **Inspection**: Observe for vaginal wall descent, mucosal changes, or ulceration [^927e7f6e].
- **Palpation**: Use a split-speculum technique to isolate the anterior vaginal wall and assess the extent of descent [^927e7f6e].
- **Pelvic floor muscle function**: Assess strength and tenderness with palpation [^66d69fb5].

---

## Pelvic organ prolapse quantification (POP-Q)

The POP-Q system is the **gold standard** for objectively quantifying prolapse severity [^bf140ab2]. It measures nine points relative to the hymenal ring and assigns stages from 0 to IV based on the extent of descent [^9eff8419]:

| **Stage** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Stage 0 | No prolapse |
| Stage I | Descent > 1 cm above the hymen |
| Stage II | Descent to within 1 cm of the hymen |
| Stage III | Descent > 1 cm past the hymen |
| Stage IV | Complete vaginal eversion |

---

## Assessment of bladder function

Bladder function assessment is critical, particularly in patients with anterior vaginal wall prolapse:

- **Postvoid residual (PVR)**: Measure PVR in patients with prolapse beyond the hymen or abnormal voiding symptoms. Normal PVR is < 50 mL; > 200 mL is considered abnormal [^7dd6c7df] [^5d505556].
- **Cough stress test**: Perform with the prolapse in place and reduced to assess for occult stress urinary incontinence (SUI) [^c6f1cc5c].
- **Urodynamic testing**: Consider in patients with mixed incontinence, voiding dysfunction, or when surgery is planned and occult SUI risk must be assessed [^5fe5c8c4] [^022c1de6].

---

## Imaging studies

Imaging is not routinely required but may be useful in selected scenarios:

- **Translabial ultrasound**: Useful for assessing bladder neck mobility, residual urine, and paravaginal defects [^notfound].
- **Dynamic MRI**: Provides detailed soft-tissue visualization and is useful when physical examination is inconclusive or for complex multicompartment prolapse [^3ac2fbee].
- **Fluoroscopic cystocolpoproctography**: Considered when dynamic assessment of multiple compartments is needed [^5737c0e4].

---

## Differential diagnosis

It is essential to differentiate bladder prolapse from other conditions that may present similarly:

- **Urethral prolapse**: Protrusion of the urethral mucosa through the meatus [^notfound].
- **Ureterocele prolapse**: Rare prolapse of a ureterocele through the urethra [^76dcec31].
- **Vaginal wall cysts or tumors**: May mimic prolapse on examination [^notfound].

---

## Documentation and follow-up

Accurate documentation of findings, including POP-Q measurements, PVR, and symptom assessment, is essential for **ongoing management and follow-up**. Regular follow-up is recommended to monitor progression and response to treatment [^notfound].

---

Checking for a prolapsed bladder involves a **combination of clinical history, physical examination, and selective functional testing**. The POP-Q system provides objective quantification, while bladder function assessment and imaging are reserved for specific indications. This structured approach ensures accurate diagnosis and guides appropriate management.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for pelvic organ prolapse, more specifically with respect to history and physical examination, AUGS 2017 guidelines recommend to assess bladder function:

- **Continence**: consider performing a cough stress test with the prolapse in the native, neutral, and reduced position (at bladder volume of 300 mL or capacity, whichever is less); assess the risk of occult stress urinary incontinence using available risk prediction models if considering surgery

- **Emptying**: evaluate postvoid residual urine volume in patients with anterior vaginal wall prolapse beyond the hymen or abnormal voiding symptoms.

Complete bladder prolapse through the urethra is very rare but needs to be recognised early as it can lead to serious complications and requires prompt treatment. Several predisposing factors have been described. A high index of suspicion is required for diagnosis, and the involvement of a multidisciplinary team approach is important in the management of such patients.

Comment

Strengths and limitations

The strengths of this review include a comprehensive search of both published and unpublished studies, applying explicit criteria to potentially eligible studies, and employing standardized, piloted data forms for data collection, guided by written instructions, and an unbiased assessment and synthesis of reported associations. We followed a prespecified data analysis plan, and contacted authors for clarifications and additional data.

Among the challenges faced in this review was the inclusion of studies with varying diagnostic criteria. There may be considerable disparity between symptomatic and objective findings for both LUTS and prolapse, and despite long-standing efforts for standardizationdiagnostic criteria are not widely agreed upon. Despite this caution, we found that the literature had used largely concordant definitions. From the prolapse studies, 2 studies had used a prolapse case definition based on need for surgical treatment, but all others used an accepted anatomic staging system, typically POP Quantification. There was also little variation in cutoffs for significant prolapse, with almost all studies considering prolapse stage 0 or stage 1 as normal/control. Both overactive bladder studies included in metaanalysis used a combination of self-reported symptoms, with 3-day bladder diary for diagnosis. Similarly both SUI studies included in metaanalysis used a combination of cystometry and pad testing for diagnosis. This is reflected in a lack of heterogeneity in most metaanalyses. Regardless of the presence of statistical heterogeneity, there remains potential for bias toward the null from heterogeneity in case definitions.

It is evident that overactive bladder in particular may have multiple underlying causes, and these syntheses may therefore include participants with diverse underlying etiologies for their symptoms. The largest metaanalyses possible still include < 1000 participants in total, and therefore provide adequate power only for associations with large effect size (approximately OR, ≤ 0.6 or OR, ≥ 1.8). It is both likely that smaller effect sizes have been missed in these syntheses, and highly probable that polymorphisms with larger effect sizes are still to be discovered.

Future work

Future advances are likely within the context of GWAS using large-scale population-based cohorts phenotyped for these conditions. The discovery of further causative variants should both help to explain the complex pathophysiology of these conditions, and provide potentially a route to effective prevention and treatment.

Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) evaluation — core assessment and counseling state that women with prolapse should have an examination to quantify the loss of anatomic support and be evaluated for associated bladder, bowel and prolapse symptoms, as well as associated bother; treatment options should be tailored to personal goals, and in most cases women should be informed of the range of treatment options including observation as well as nonsurgical and surgical management. For patients presenting with POP, the listed actions are to determine the duration and severity of pelvic symptoms and associated bother; ask specifically about urinary, bowel, sexual symptoms, and previous treatments; obtain a medical and surgical history including previous pelvic surgery; perform a physical examination including a pelvic organ prolapse quantification (POP-Q) examination and assessment of pelvic floor muscle function (strength and tenderness with palpation); and quantify the extent of the prolapse using the POP-Q examination and confirm that the examination findings reflect the patient's experience.

Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) evaluation — bleeding and bladder assessment and asymptomatic management include to assess for abnormal vaginal bleeding, document the patient's denial of vaginal bleeding, and evaluate symptoms of vaginal bleeding to rule out premalignant or malignant conditions. Bladder function assessment includes to assess bladder function with continence testing to consider cough stress test with the prolapse in the native, neutral, and reduced position at bladder volume of 300 mL or capacity, whichever is less, and if considering surgery to assess risk of occult stress urinary incontinence using available risk prediction models; for emptying, evaluate PVR urine volume in patients with anterior vaginal wall prolapse beyond the hymen or abnormal voiding symptoms. For management, asymptomatic women without evidence of urinary retention can be offered expectant management, and asymptomatic women should be offered an appropriate range of interventions based upon their medical histories and treatment goals, including vaginal pessary and surgery.

### Pelvic organ prolapse [^0be306e0]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Pelvic organ prolapse, or genital prolapse, is the descent of one or more of the pelvic structures (bladder, uterus, vagina) from the normal anatomic location toward or through the vaginal opening. Women of all ages may be affected, although pelvic organ prolapse is more common in older women. The cause is a loss of pelvic support from multiple factors, including direct injury to the levator ani, as well as neurologic injury from stretching of the pudendal nerves that may occur with vaginal childbirth. Previous hysterectomy for pelvic organ prolapse; ethnicity; and an increase in intra-abdominal pressure from chronic coughing, straining with constipation, or repeated heavy lifting may contribute. Most patients with pelvic organ prolapse are asymptomatic. A sense of bulging or protrusion in the vagina is the most specific symptom. Evaluation includes a systematic pelvic examination. Management options for women with symptomatic prolapse include observation, pelvic floor muscle training, mechanical support (pessaries), and surgery. Pessary use should be considered before surgery in women who have symptomatic prolapse. Most women can be fitted with a pessary regardless of the stage or site of predominant prolapse. Surgical procedures are obliterative or reconstructive.

### Pelvic organ prolapse [^662d7797]. Lancet (2007). Excellent credibility.

Pelvic organ prolapse is downward descent of female pelvic organs, including the bladder, uterus or post-hysterectomy vaginal cuff, and the small or large bowel, resulting in protrusion of the vagina, uterus, or both. Prolapse development is multifactorial, with vaginal child birth, advancing age, and increasing body-mass index as the most consistent risk factors. Vaginal delivery, hysterectomy, chronic straining, normal ageing, and abnormalities of connective tissue or connective-tissue repair predispose some women to disruption, stretching, or dysfunction of the levator ani complex, connective-tissue attachments of the vagina, or both, resulting in prolapse. Patients generally present with several complaints, including bladder, bowel, and pelvic symptoms; however, with the exception of vaginal bulging, none is specific to prolapse. Women with symptoms suggestive of prolapse should undergo a pelvic examination and medical history check. Radiographic assessment is usually unnecessary. Many women with pelvic organ prolapse are asymptomatic and do not need treatment. When prolapse is symptomatic, options include observation, pessary use, and surgery. Surgical strategies for prolapse can be categorised broadly by reconstructive and obliterative techniques. Reconstructive procedures can be done by either an abdominal or vaginal approach. Although no effective prevention strategy for prolapse has been identified, considerations include weight loss, reduction of heavy lifting, treatment of constipation, modification or reduction of obstetric risk factors, and pelvic-floor physical therapy.

### American Urogynecologic Society best practice statement: evaluation and counseling of patients with pelvic organ prolapse [^7dd6c7df]. Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Pelvic organ prolapse — voiding evaluation recommends that for women with abnormal voiding symptoms and for those with prolapse beyond the hymen, bladder emptying be evaluated with a postvoid residual (PVR) measurement; in general, a PVR of less than one third of the total voided volume is considered adequate emptying, with suggested parameters of a PVR of less than 50 mL as normal and a PVR greater than 200 mL as abnormal. If PVR is elevated or other bothersome voiding symptoms are noted, urodynamic testing may provide additional information. Treatment of prolapse may be considered even in asymptomatic patients if they have persistent voiding symptoms. Because 30% of women with advanced prolapse (Aa, Ba, or C measurements of +1 or greater) have hydronephrosis, imaging of the upper urinary tracts may be helpful in select patients.

Conclusion

In comparison trials, no imaging modality appeared superior to another. Overall, the value of diagnostic imaging in POP management remains unclear and understudied.

### Prenatally diagnosed patent urachus with bladder prolapse [^7dca5fec]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

We report 2 cases of patent urachus with bladder prolapse, which has a characteristic finding of "disappearance of cyst" antenatally. In the first case, a 34-year-old woman presented at 14 weeks gestation for evaluation of a cyst. Prenatal ultrasonography revealed a cystic mass at the base of the umbilical cord, communicating with the bladder. At 26 weeks gestation, the cyst had disappeared, and a solid mass bulged out inferior to the umbilical cord. At term, the patient delivered a male infant. Examination of the neonate demonstrated mucosal protrusion inferior to the umbilical cord. Catheterization confirmed communication with the bladder. We diagnosed patent urachus with bladder prolapse. In the second case, a 36-year-old woman presented at 19 weeks gestation for evaluation of moderate bilateral hydronephrosis and an abdominal cyst. Prenatal ultrasonography revealed a cystic mass at the base of the umbilical cord, communicating with the bladder. At 26 weeks gestation, the cyst had disappeared. At term, the patient delivered a male infant displaying patent urachus with bladder prolapse. Understanding of the development of urachus is important for prenatal diagnosis, which in turn allows surgery immediately after birth. We showed bladder function after surgery remains good at school age.

Additional testing beyond history and physical for pelvic organ prolapse — In general, no additional testing is needed before treatment; however, if prolapse is beyond the hymen or there are voiding symptoms, record a postvoid residual by catheter or ultrasonography, for urinary urgency or other lower urinary tract symptoms perform a urinalysis with culture and microscopy if indicated, urodynamic testing may help inform counseling and may be considered for bothersome incontinence with stage II or greater prolapse or voiding dysfunction, and if initial findings do not concur with symptoms obtain more specific imaging or refer to a urogynecologic specialist.

### Umbilical cord prolapse [^e476c429]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Umbilical cord prolapse is an obstetric emergency that can have negative outcomes for the fetus. It is diagnosed by a palpable or visible cord and is often accompanied by severe, rapid fetal heart rate decelerations. Cases of cord prolapse should be delivered as soon as possible, usually by cesarean section. While awaiting delivery, the fetal presenting part should be elevated off the cord either manually or by filling the bladder. Although an untreated case of umbilical cord prolapse can lead to severe fetal morbidity and mortality, prompt and appropriate management leads to good overall outcomes.

We describe our experience in 2 institutions handling bladder prolapse through a patent urachus (PU), together with a brief review of published literature. Case 1: A term neonate with congenital prolapsed bladder via PU. Ultrasound at 21 weeks gestation revealed a male fetus with a large midline pelvic cyst communicating with the bladder which disappeared on subsequent 27 weeks ultrasound. Case 2: A term female neonate with congenital prolapsed bladder via PU with no prenatal diagnosis. In both cases the bladder closure was undertaken during the newborns' first days of life.

Introduction and Hypothesis

This manuscript from Chapter 2 of the International Urogynecology Consultation (IUC) on Pelvic Organ Prolapse (POP) reviews the literature involving the clinical evaluation of a patient with POP and associated bladder and bowel dysfunction.

Methods

An international group of 11 clinicians performed a search of the literature using pre-specified search MESH terms in PubMed and Embase databases (January 2000 to August 2020). Publications were eliminated if not relevant to the clinical evaluation of patients or did not include clear definitions of POP. The titles and abstracts were reviewed using the Covidence database to determine whether they met the inclusion criteria. The manuscripts were reviewed for suitability using the Specialist Unit for Review Evidence checklists. The data from full-text manuscripts were extracted and then reviewed.

Results

The search strategy found 11,242 abstracts, of which 220 articles were used to inform this narrative review. The main themes of this manuscript were the clinical examination, and the evaluation of comorbid conditions including the urinary tract (LUTS), gastrointestinal tract (GIT), pain, and sexual function. The physical examination of patients with pelvic organ prolapse (POP) should include a reproducible method of describing and quantifying the degree of POP and only the Pelvic Organ Quantification (POP-Q) system or the Simplified Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification (S-POP) system have enough reproducibility to be recommended. POP examination should be done with an empty bladder and patients can be supine but should be upright if the prolapse cannot be reproduced. No other parameters of the examination aid in describing and quantifying POP. Post-void residual urine volume > 100 mL is commonly used to assess for voiding difficulty. Prolapse reduction can be used to predict the possibility of postoperative persistence of voiding difficulty. There is no benefit of urodynamic testing for assessment of detrusor overactivity as it does not change the management. In women with POP and stress urinary incontinence (SUI), the cough stress test should be performed with a bladder volume of at least 200 mL and with the prolapse reduced either with a speculum or by a pessary. The urodynamic assessment only changes management when SUI and voiding dysfunction co-exist. Demonstration of preoperative occult SUI has a positive predictive value for de novo SUI of 40% but most useful is its absence, which has a negative predictive value of 91%. The routine addition of radiographic or physiological testing of the GIT currently has no additional value for a physical examination. In subjects with GIT symptoms further radiological but not physiological testing appears to aid in diagnosing enteroceles, sigmoidoceles, and intussusception, but there are no data on how this affects outcomes. There were no articles in the search on the evaluation of the co-morbid conditions of pain or sexual dysfunction in women with POP.

Conclusions

The clinical pelvic examination remains the central tool for evaluation of POP and a system such as the POP-Q or S-POP should be used to describe and quantify. The value of investigation for urinary tract dysfunction was discussed and findings presented. The routine addition of GI radiographic or physiological testing is currently not recommended. There are no data on the role of the routine assessment of pain or sexual function, and this area needs more study. Imaging studies alone cannot replace clinical examination for the assessment of POP.

There were no articles in the search on the evaluation of the co-morbid conditions of pain or sexual dysfunction in women with POP.

Conclusions

The clinical pelvic examination remains the central tool for evaluation of POP and a system such as the POP-Q or S-POP should be used to describe and quantify. The value of investigation for urinary tract dysfunction was discussed and findings presented. The routine addition of GI radiographic or physiological testing is currently not recommended. There are no data on the role of the routine assessment of pain or sexual function, and this area needs more study. Imaging studies alone cannot replace clinical examination for the assessment of POP.

### Heterogeneity in post-intervention prolapse and urinary outcome reporting: a one-year review of the international urogynecology journal [^7d5193ac]. International Urogynecology Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

This review aimed to examine post-intervention prolapse, incontinence, and overactive bladder outcome measures published in the International Urogynecology Journal over the previous year and to report on the heterogeneity in outcome reporting.

Methods

All original article abstracts published in the print version of the International Urogynecology Journal in 2014 were reviewed for possible inclusion. Those reporting on prolapse and/or incontinence and/or overactive bladder outcomes following a urogynecological intervention were analyzed. Articles were reviewed for all reported outcomes. Outcomes were categorized as primary or secondary and objective or subjective.

Results

Of 117 original articles published, 45 were reviewed. Among primary outcomes, 9 different outcomes were reported for prolapse and 11 for incontinence and overactive bladder. For prolapse, 6 different objective and 13 subjective outcomes were reported. For incontinence, 21 objective and 36 subjective outcomes were reported. Three different definitions were used for the outcome of "prolapse cure", 3 for "prolapse recurrence", and 4 for "stress incontinence cure". Several validated and non-validated questionnaires in addition to single unvalidated questions were used to measure subjective outcomes.

Conclusions

This research highlights the diversity in outcome reporting for prolapse, incontinence, and overactive bladder after an intervention in the last year of publications alone. This can lead to serious challenges in the generation of higher order evidence, such as systematic reviews and meta-analyses. As a subspecialty, we need to aim for more cohesive reporting so as to allow for robust comparison and evidence dissemination.

### Urodynamics in pelvic organ prolapse: when are they helpful and how do we use them? [^653aac83]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

The routine use of preoperative urodynamics in the woman considering surgery for pelvic organ prolapse is a topic of much debate. This article addresses the use of urodynamics in patients with pelvic organ prolapse. It specifically discusses the utility of urodynamics in the evaluation stress incontinence on prolapse reduction (occult stress urinary incontinence) as well as concomitant storage and voiding symptoms in these patients.

### American Urogynecologic Society best practice statement: evaluation and counseling of patients with pelvic organ prolapse [^8ca3b540]. Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) patient history — Eliciting prolapse-related symptoms and their quality-of-life impact is the primary goal, and a patient reporting vaginal bulge that she can see or palpate is the most specific symptom for POP observed on examination. A detailed history of vaginal symptoms to be elicited includes vaginal bulging, pelvic pressure and discomfort, bleeding, discharge, splinting/ digitation, and low backache. In addition, urinary symptoms should be obtained, including increased daytime urinary frequency, nocturia, urinary incontinence, difficulty voiding (hesitancy, slow stream, intermittency, straining to void, and position-dependent micturition), and the sensation of incomplete bladder emptying. Inquiries should be made to uncover any symptoms of bowel dysfunction including constipation, diarrhea, fecal urgency, straining to defecate, feeling of incomplete bowel evacuation, and anal, fecal, or flatal incontinence, and a history of splinting or digitation to empty the bladder or rectum should also be elicited. Because POP can overlap with other conditions, other known etiologies should also be considered, and constipation, diarrhea, anal incontinence, feeling of incomplete bowel evacuation, and rectal bleeding should be evaluated for other causes.

American Urogynecologic Society consensus — cystoscopy during prolapse repair: Injury to the urinary tract is a known risk of surgical repair of anterior and apical pelvic organ prolapse, and cystoscopy at the time of surgical prolapse repair is a low-risk procedure that can identify genitourinary tract injury by inspecting the bladder and urethra as well as by visualizing the ureters and ureteral efflux; identifying injury intraoperatively may allow for mitigation of the morbidity of the injury, and universal cystoscopy should be performed at the time of all pelvic reconstructive surgeries, with the exception of operations solely for posterior compartment defects.

### Management of the urethral outlet in patients with severe prolapse [^e7921fcb]. Current Opinion in Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Numbers of women seeking consultation for pelvic floor disorders, a large portion of which will involve pelvic organ prolapse (POP) and lower urinary tract dysfunction, are expected to reach epidemic proportions within the next decade. A full understanding of the complex impact of pelvic organ prolapse on lower urinary tract function is crucial to successful management.

Recent Findings

Recent data lend support to the concept that women with POP, but no associated urethral dysfunction, may be best served by a surgical repair that carefully avoids dissection in the periurethral area. Conversely, preoperative evaluation will often reveal bladder outlet obstruction concomitant with 'hidden', 'potential', or 'occult' stress urinary incontinence when the prolapse is reduced. Many of these women will not have incontinence symptoms in daily life. Paradoxically, the mechanical bladder outlet obstruction may induce detrusor instability with subsequent obstructed/overactive bladder symptom complexes not dissimilar to those of men with prostatic bladder outlet obstruction. Anatomic research shows that the vessels and nerves supplying the urethra are particulary vulnerable to surgical techniques used in pelvic organ prolapse repair.

Summary

This mix of obstructed, overactive bladder with hidden stress incontinence increases with degree of POP, and all women with severe prolapse will fair best if evaluated for all three conditions prior to surgical repair.

### The AUA / SUFU guideline on the diagnosis and treatment of idiopathic overactive bladder [^c7597b69]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) and overactive bladder (OAB) — In a large Finnish cohort (n = 2933), anterior/apical prolapse surgery yielded greater symptom resolution than isolated posterior repair, with, at 24 months, bothersome frequency resolved in 72% versus 58% and urgency urinary incontinence (UUI) resolved in 66% versus 53%. A small retrospective study reported improvement in UUI in 89.7% with lower stage POP and 85% with higher stage POP (p = 0.12); on multivariable analysis, higher stage POP was adversely associated with improvement in OAB symptoms (adjusted OR: 0.06; 95% CI: 0.01–0.67), and women in this study had symptomatic POP in addition to OAB. Management "should be in the context of shared decision-making" and "a trial of a pessary… may be helpful during surgical planning".

### American Urogynecologic Society best practice statement: evaluation and counseling of patients with pelvic organ prolapse [^927e7f6e]. Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Physical examination for pelvic organ prolapse — initial evaluation should include recognizing that a physical examination is the next step, optimizing patient positioning because positioning the patient at a 45-degree angle in a semirecumbent position may allow a more accurate assessment whereas dorsal lithotomy may mask severity, repeating the examination in a standing position if symptoms seem more severe than findings, and performing anatomic prolapse assessment with an empty bladder. Pelvic examination begins with inspection of the perineal and vulvar skin, its architecture, and the appearance of the urethra and vaginal introitus; each compartment of the vagina (anterior, posterior, and apical) must be evaluated including inspection for keratinization and ulceration, and a split speculum technique using a single blade can isolate each compartment to assess defects separately.

### Paravaginal defect: anatomy, clinical findings, and imaging [^1e92865d]. International Urogynecology Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

The paravaginal defect has been a topic of active discussion concerning what it is, how to diagnose it, its role in anterior vaginal wall prolapse, and if and how to repair it. The aim of this article was to review the existing literature on paravaginal defect and discuss its role in the anterior vaginal wall support system, with an emphasis on anatomy and imaging.

Methods

Articles related to paravaginal defects were identified through a PubMed search ending 1 July 2015.

Results

Support of the anterior vaginal wall is a complex system involving levator ani muscle, arcus tendineus fascia pelvis (ATFP), pubocervical fascia, and uterosacral/cardinal ligaments. Studies conclude that physical examination is inconsistent in detecting paravaginal defects. Ultrasound (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been used to describe patterns in the appearance of the vagina and bladder when a paravaginal defect is suspected. Different terms have been used (e.g., sagging of bladder base, loss of tenting), which all represent changes in pelvic floor support but that could be due to both paravaginal and levator ani defects.

Conclusion

Paravaginal support plays a role in supporting the anterior vaginal wall, but we still do not know the degree to which it contributes to the development of prolapse. Both MRI and US are useful in the diagnosis of paravaginal defects, but further studies are needed to evaluate their use.

### Current treatment of pelvic organ prolapse correlated with chronic pelvic pain, bladder and bowel dysfunction [^bfedfd90]. Current Opinion in Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The purpose of this review is to critically analyze the relationship between symptoms of abnormal emptying of the bladder, urgency, pelvic pain, anorectal dysfunction and pelvic organ prolapse (POP) and to present evidence in order to show how many of the above mentioned symptoms can be cured or substantially improved by repair of specific pelvic ligaments.

Recent Findings

In this review, we provide evidence to show how often these dysfunctions occur and how they can be cured in 42–94% by appropriate pelvic floor surgery in the longer term, up to 2 years. Laxity in ligaments and/or vaginal membrane due to damaged connective tissue may prevent the normal opening and closure mechanism of urethra and anus, because muscles need finite lengths to contract properly. Hypermobility of the apex can irritate the pelvic plexus causing chronic pelvic pain. In consequence, dysfunctions as abnormal emptying of the bladder, urgency, pelvic pain, fecal incontinence and obstructed defecation can occur in women with different degrees of POP.

Summary

In conclusion, it has to be recognized that women bothered by these symptoms should be examined for POP and appropriately advised for possibility of cure by pelvic floor surgery after careful selection. VIDEO ABSTRACT.

### International urogynecological consultation chapter 2.2: imaging in the diagnosis of pelvic organ prolapse [^f7d76f9b]. International Urogynecology Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion Points

The intended use of imaging test can be diagnosis, screening, staging, monitoring, surveillance, prediction, or prognosis. This narrative review focuses on the diagnostic value of different imaging modalities in POP. Our working group identified a significant gap in the current literature surrounding imaging use. There is a lack of well-designed studies with clear definitions of reference standard defining POP as disease. Largely, it is stemming from the lack of consensus of what defines "clinically significant POP". Imaging techniques appear to perform moderately well in the diagnosis of advanced POP stages, but those POP cases are easily diagnosed on pelvic examination. An ideal study would be a large cohort focusing on low-grade POP, where the "clinically significant prolapse" is diagnosed as a combination of pelvic examination evidence of POP and the presence of symptoms determined by validated questionnaires. The studies with a similar design will need to be repeated in diverse patient populations. Only after this evidence is obtained can we gain a better insight into the diagnostic abilities of different imaging modalities.

### Online prediction tool for female pelvic floor dysfunction: development and validation [^6b472704]. International Urogynecology Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

The aim was to develop and validate (internally and externally) a prediction model for the presence and diagnosis of pelvic floor dysfunction (PFD) in women, including pelvic organ prolapse, stress urinary incontinence and/or overactive bladder via a patient-completed online tool.

Methods

Using a retrospective cohort of women aged > 18 years, from multiple tertiary gynaecology units within Queensland, Australia (2014–2018), the prediction model was developed via penalized logistic regression with internal and external validation utilizing multiple clinical predictors (42 questions from the Australian Pelvic Floor Questionnaire and demographics: age, body mass index, parity and mode of delivery). The main outcome measures were the accuracy of the model in predicting a diagnosis of pelvic floor dysfunction and its specific conditions of prolapse and incontinence.

Results

A total of 3,501 women were utilized for model development and internal validation and 449 for external validation. On internal validation the model correctly identified those with PFD with 97% sensitivity, 74% specificity and a concordance index (C-index) of 0.96. Predictions of pelvic organ prolapse were also accurate, with 86% sensitivity, 83% specificity, C-index 0.83, as was stress urinary incontinence, 84% sensitivity, 87% specificity, C-index 0.87, and overactive bladder, 76% sensitivity, 77% specificity, C-index 0.77. External validation confirmed the model's accuracy with a similar C-index in all parameters.

Conclusions

This model provides an accurate online tool to differentiate between those with and without PFD and diagnoses of common pelvic floor disorders. It serves as a valuable self-assessment for women and primary care providers.

### Dynamic magnetic resonance imaging of the female pelvic floor-a pictorial review [^5e233539]. Insights Into Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

A cystocele is, by definition, an abnormal descent of the bladder, pushing posteriorly the anterior wall of the vagina. Cystoceles may present as stress urinary incontinence and/or urinary retention, in the last case usually when there is a disproportional descent of the posterior wall of the bladder, resulting in kinking of the bladder neck. It is caused by a loss of support from the pubocervical fascia (part of the endopelvic fascia), due to tearing and/or stretching, and is diagnosed by MR defecography when the most inferior aspect of the bladder is more than 1 cm below the PCL (Fig. 10). Its severity relates with the distance between these two points of reference and is graded, just like other pelvic prolapses, as small, moderate, and severe, when less than 3 cm, between 3 and 6 cm and more than 6 cm below the PCL respectively. When the bladder prolapses, it occupies part of the width of the levator hiatus, pushing posterior and inferiorly both the vagina and the anorectal junction. Consequently, both H and M lines increase, related to stretching the levator ani muscle. Over time, this stretching may induce weakness and dysfunction of all the pelvic floor. Cystoceles, like all pelvic prolapses, are better depicted in the late evacuation phase, due both to the increased abdominal pressure and the relaxation of the pelvic diaphragm (Fig. 10 b). When the posterior wall is disproportionally prolapsed, ureterohidronephrosis may coexist due to entrapment of the distal ureters by the pelvic musculature.

### American Urogynecologic Society best practice statement: evaluation and counseling of patients with pelvic organ prolapse [^d73dacad]. Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Pelvic organ prolapse — occult stress urinary incontinence (OSUI) risk highlights that in women with anterior and apical POP, prolapse may lead to urethral kinking that obstructs the urethra and masks incontinence, and when treated with pessary or surgery the obstruction is alleviated and the patient may develop stress urinary incontinence. A cough stress test with the prolapse in the native, neutral, and reduced position (at a bladder volume of 300 mL or capacity, whichever is less) is commonly used to identify women at risk of developing OSUI, and approximately 40% of women with negative testing will develop postoperative stress incontinence if an anti-incontinence procedure is not performed, whereas 60% of women with a positive test will have postoperative stress urinary incontinence.

### The effect of bladder fullness on evaluation of pelvic organ prolapse [^f5f1cf56]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the effect of bladder fullness on pelvic organ prolapse (POP) staging via the Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification System (POP-Q).

Methods

Sixty women with advanced POP underwent pelvic examination with maximal Valsalva straining via POP-Q with an empty bladder and after transcatheter bladder filling to maximum cystometric capacity, with simultaneous intra-abdominal and intravesical pressure recordings. Main outcome measures included POP-Q values and staging with full versus empty bladder.

Results

An empty bladder was associated with a significantly higher POP-Q staging (median, 3 vs 2; P < 0.0001); and a lower location of points Ba (4.51 vs 1.37; P < 0.0001), Aa (2.58 vs 0.62; P < 0.0001), Bp (-0.68 vs -1.10; P = 0.01), Ap (0.83 vs -1.27; P = 0.002), C (1.57 vs -1.07; P < 0.0001), and D (0.14 vs -2.77; P < 0.0001) compared with a full bladder. However, genital hiatus, perineal body, and total vaginal length values were not significantly affected by bladder fullness. No differences in intra-abdominal or detrusor pressures were noted between empty and full bladder states.

Conclusion

POP-Q assessment with a full bladder is associated with underestimation of POP severity. Therefore, bladder emptying should be a standard requirement for POP-Q staging and reporting.

### The prevalence and risk factors of overactive bladder symptoms and its relation to pelvic organ prolapse symptoms in a general female population [^1b152a3c]. International Urogynecology Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) and overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms are important problems for women. POP is a prevalent problem which has been reported to affect 50% of parous women. Eleven percent of the women will have undergone an operation for prolapse or urinary incontinence by the age of 80.

OAB is known to be a highly prevalent disorder that increases with age in both sexes and that has a profound impact on quality of life. According to the International Continence Society (ICS) OAB is defined as urgency with or without urge incontinence, usually with frequency and nocturia. This term can only be used if there is no proven infection or 'obvious pathology'. It is a matter of debate whether POP should be considered as 'obvious pathology'.

Symptoms of OAB are often seen in patients with POP. Community based studies showed that the prevalence of OAB symptoms is higher in patients with POP than without POP. The same tendency is found in hospital based studies. Nevertheless, the literature about the prevalence of the combination of POP and OAB is scarce.

To study the relation between POP and OAB, we used data from a cross-sectional study which was performed in a small Dutch city about the prevalence of pelvic floor symptoms in the general population.

The objective of this study is to investigate risk factors for OAB and specifically to explore the relationship between OAB and prolapse. This is important for clinical practice because the two diagnoses are often co-occurring which has possible consequences for diagnosis and treatment.

### Effects of a full bladder and patient positioning on pelvic organ prolapse assessment [^056625cd]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the effect of bladder filling and patient position on the degree of pelvic organ prolapse (of the maximally prolapsed segment).

Methods

Fifty consecutive patients with symptomatic pelvic organ prolapse were evaluated between February 2003 and August 2003. Patients were examined in the supine lithotomy and standing position at maximal bladder capacity and then in the supine lithotomy and standing position with an empty bladder. The International Continence Society's Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification system was used.

Results

The mean descent of prolapse beyond the hymen was 0.39 cm in the full/supine setting, 1.3 cm, full/standing, 1.9 cm, empty/supine, and 2.7 cm, empty/standing. All mean paired differences in the six examination pairs (empty/standing compared with empty/supine, full/standing compared with full/supine, full/standing compared with empty/standing, full/supine compared with empty/supine, full/standing compared with empty/supine, and full/supine compared with empty/standing) were statistically significantly different. The largest mean paired difference was noted in the full/supine compared with empty/standing pair (-2.3, 95% confidence interval -2.8 to -1.8, P < .001). Age and parity were not associated with differences in measurements taken in the different examination conditions. Using a linear regression model to control for body mass index, maximal bladder capacity, and Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification system stage, it was found that the values were still statistically significant. Full/supine compared with empty/standing pairs were significantly more likely to be upstaged by 1 stage (P < .001), or by 2 stages (P = 0.049), but not by 3 stages (P = 0.061).

Conclusion

Unless a patient is examined in the standing position with an empty bladder, the full extent of the prolapse may not be appreciated.

### Two unusual presentations of bladder diverticula [^6a5ecf53]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Bladder diverticula are protrusions of the mucosal and submucosal layers of the bladder through the muscular wall of the bladder. We discuss the identification and management of two unusual presentations of bladder diverticula.

Case

In two cases of bladder diverticula, one presented as pelvic organ prolapse and the other largely replaced the anterior cervix and was incidentally encountered during a loop electrosurgical excision procedure. Both were discovered intraoperatively and repaired surgically.

Conclusion

Alternatives to pelvic organ prolapse must be in the differential diagnosis when evaluating a patient with complaints of vaginal bulging.

### Bladder prolapse through a patent urachus presenting as an umbilical mass in the newborn: characteristic prenatal sonographic findings and the diagnostic benefit of postnatal cystography [^70b34826]. Pediatric Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Bladder prolapse through a patent urachus is rare. We present a newborn with an unusual exophytic, erythematous umbilical mass. Voiding cystography readily demonstrated continuity of the bladder dome with the umbilical mass, confirming bladder prolapse through a patent urachus. The diagnosis of bladder prolapse was rapidly made in a second newborn with similar imaging and clinical findings and confirmed by cystography. We discuss the embryology of this condition including the association with a vesico-allantoic cyst in utero. Pre- and postnatal images are presented. The use of cystography in diagnosis is emphasized.

### Natural history of lower urinary tract symptoms in treatment-seeking women with pelvic organ prolapse; the symptoms of lower urinary tract dysfunction research network (LURN) [^8254f740]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The association of pelvic organ prolapse with overactive bladder and other lower urinary tract symptoms, and the natural history of those symptoms are not well characterized. Previous cross-sectional studies demonstrated conflicting relationships between prolapse and lower urinary tract symptoms.

Objective

This study primarily aimed to determine the baseline association between lower urinary tract symptoms and prolapse and to assess longitudinal differences in symptoms over 12 months in women with and without prolapse. Secondary aims were to explore associations between lower urinary tract symptoms and prolapse treatment. We hypothesized that: (1) prolapse is associated with the presence of lower urinary tract symptoms, (2) lower urinary tract symptoms are stable over time in patients with and without prolapse, and (3) prolapse treatment is associated with lower urinary tract symptom improvement.

Study Design

Women enrolled in the Symptoms of Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction Research Network Observational Cohort Study with adequate 12-month follow-up data were included. Prolapse and lower urinary tract symptom treatment during follow-up was guided by standard of care. Outcome measures included the Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms Tool total severity score (in addition to overactive bladder, obstructive, and stress urinary incontinence subscales) and Urogenital Distress Inventory-6 Short Form. Prolapse (yes or no) was defined primarily when Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification System points Ba, C or Bp were > 0 (beyond the hymen). Mixed-effects models with random effects for patient slopes and intercepts were fitted for each lower urinary tract symptom outcome and prolapse predictor, adjusted for other covariates. The study had > 90% power to detect differences as small as 0.4 standard deviation for less prevalent group comparisons (eg, prolapse vs not).

Results

A total of 371 women were analyzed, including 313 (84%) with no prolapse and 58 (16%) with prolapse. Women with prolapse were older (64.6 ± 8.8 vs 55.3 ± 14.1 years; P < .001) and more likely to have prolapse surgery (28% vs 1%; P < .001) and pessary treatment (26% vs 4%; P < .001) during the study. Average baseline Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms Tool total severity scores were lower (fewer symptoms) for participants with prolapse compared with those without (38.9 ± 14.0 vs 43.2 ± 14.0; P = 0.036), but there were no differences in average scores between prolapse groups for other scales. For all urinary outcomes, average scores were significantly lower (improved) at 3 and 12 months compared with baseline (all P < .05). In mixed-effects models, there were no statistically significant interactions between pelvic organ prolapse measurement and visit and time-dependent prolapse treatment groups (P > .05 for all regression interaction coefficients). The Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms Tool obstructive severity score had a statistically significant positive association with Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification System Ba, Bp, and point of maximum vaginal descent. The Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms Tool total severity scale had a statistically significant negative association with Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification System Ba and point of maximum vaginal descent. No other associations between prolapse and lower urinary tract symptoms were significant (P > .05 for all regression coefficients). Symptom differences between prolapse groups were small: all regression coefficients (interpretable as additive percentage change in each score) were between -5 and 5 (standard deviation of outcomes ranged from 14.0–32.4).

Conclusion

Among treatment-seeking women with urinary symptoms, obstructive symptoms were positively associated with prolapse, and overall lower urinary tract symptom severity was negatively associated with prolapse. Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms Tool scores improved over 12 months regardless of prolapse status, including in those with treated prolapse, untreated prolapse, and without prolapse.

### Making sense of urodynamic studies for women with urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse: a urogynecology perspective [^de387a6a]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

The support for routine urodynamic testing in the management of women with urinary incontinence or pelvic organ prolapse is eroding. The reasons for this change largely reflect the growing evidence that urodynamic testing in this context renders little additional information over basic office assessment. The clinical features of urodynamic testing and its diagnostic and prognostic precision and accuracy are all problematic. As our understanding of female lower urinary tract dysfunction improves, the inadequacy of urodynamic testing to meaningfully improve patient and clinician decision making has become more apparent.

Pelvic organ prolapse — The following recommendations are based primarily on consensus and expert opinion (Level C): A POP-Q examination is recommended before treatment for the objective evaluation and documentation of the extent of prolapse. A pessary should be considered for a woman with symptomatic POP who wishes to become pregnant in the future. Pelvic organ prolapse vaginal mesh repair should be limited to high-risk individuals in whom the benefit of mesh placement may justify the risk, with informed consent before placement of synthetic mesh grafts in the anterior vaginal wall after reviewing the benefits and risks of the procedure and discussing alternative repairs. Surgeons who perform POP surgery with biologic grafts or synthetic mesh grafts should have training specifically for these procedures and should be able to counsel patients regarding the risk–benefit ratio for the use of mesh compared with native tissue repair. Routine intraoperative cystoscopy during POP surgery is recommended when the surgical procedure performed is associated with a significant risk of injury to the bladder or ureter, including suspension of the vaginal apex to the uterosacral ligaments, sacrocolpopexy, anterior colporrhaphy, and placement of mesh in the anterior and apical compartments. All women with significant apical prolapse, anterior prolapse, or both should have a preoperative evaluation for occult stress urinary incontinence, with cough stress testing or urodynamic testing with the prolapse reduced. Patients with POP but without stress urinary incontinence who are undergoing either abdominal or vaginal prolapse repair should be counseled that postoperative stress urinary incontinence is more likely without a concomitant continence procedure but that the risk of adverse effects is increased with an additional procedure.

### Pelvic organ prolapse: ACOG practice bulletin, number 214 [^5b3d523b]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) — intraoperative cystoscopy during prolapse surgery is recommended when procedures carry risk to the lower urinary tract, and it should be performed and acted upon intraoperatively. Routine intraoperative cystoscopy during POP surgery is recommended when the surgical procedure performed is associated with a significant risk of injury to the bladder or ureter, including suspension of the vaginal apex to the uterosacral ligaments, sacrocolpopexy, anterior colporrhaphy, and placement of mesh in the anterior and apical compartments; intraoperative cystoscopy is performed after completion of POP repair while the patient is still under anesthesia and should include a complete survey of the bladder and assessment of efflux of urine from the ureteral orifices, with identified issues addressed intraoperatively because delay in recognition of a urinary tract injury may lead to increased morbidity.

### Pelvic organ prolapse [^1196c8d5]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Pelvic organ prolapse is the descent of one or more of the anterior vaginal wall, posterior vaginal wall, the uterus (cervix), or the apex of the vagina (vaginal vault or cuff scar after hysterectomy). Prevalence increases with age. The cause of prolapse is multifactorial but is primarily associated with pregnancy and vaginal delivery, which lead to direct pelvic floor muscle and connective tissue injury. Hysterectomy, pelvic surgery, and conditions associated with sustained episodes of increased intra-abdominal pressure, including obesity, chronic cough, constipation, and repeated heavy lifting, also contribute to prolapse. Most patients with pelvic organ prolapse are asymptomatic. Symptoms become more bothersome as the bulge protrudes past the vaginal opening. Initial evaluation includes a history and systematic pelvic examination including assessment for urinary incontinence, bladder outlet obstruction, and fecal incontinence. Treatment options include observation, vaginal pessaries, and surgery. Most women can be successfully fit with a vaginal pessary. Available surgical options are reconstructive pelvic surgery with or without mesh augmentation and obliterative surgery.

### Incontinence and voiding difficulties associated with prolapse [^37419c48]. The Journal of Urology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

Prolapse is the protrusion of a pelvic organ beyond its normal anatomical confines. It represents the failure of fibromuscular supports.

Materials and Methods

A MEDLINE search was done using the keywords cystocele, uterine prolapse, vault prolapse, enterocele or rectocele in combination with urinary incontinence. We reviewed 97 articles. From this material the definition, classification, incidence, symptoms and evaluation are described.

Results

Prolapse and urinary incontinence often occur concomitantly and cystocele, rectocele, enterocele, uterine descent or vaginal vault prolapse may also be present. The pathophysiology of prolapse encompasses direct and indirect injury, metabolic abnormalities and chronic high intra-abdominal pressure. Anterior vaginal wall prolapse may present as stress incontinence. A large cystocele may cause urethral kinking and overflow incontinence. Uterine descent can cause lower back and sacral pain. Enterocele may cause only vague symptoms of vaginal discomfort. A rectocele can lead to incomplete evacuation of stool. A thorough history and physical examination are the most important means of assessment. A voiding diary helps determine functional bladder capacity. Uroflow examination determines the average and maximum flow rates, and the shape of the curve can help identify Valsalva augmented voiding. Multichannel urodynamics or video-urodynamics with prolapse reduced can be important. The advantages of dynamic magnetic resonance imaging include excellent depiction of the soft tissues and pelvic organs, and their fluid content during various degrees of pelvic strain. To our knowledge whether it is cost-effective in this manner has not been determined.

Conclusions

Correction of prolapse must aim to restore vaginal function and any concomitant urinary incontinence.

### Does the vaginal wall become thinner as prolapse grade increases? [^164fdd3c]. International Urogynecology Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

Women with symptomatic prolapse were recruited over an 18-month period from the Outpatient Department of a tertiary referral centre for urogynaecology (Fig. 1). Women were excluded if pregnant, were unable to position themselves in the lithotomy position due to mobility or muscular skeletal issues, did not speak English or had any connective tissue diseases, or recent use of vaginal hormones, or previous surgery for prolapse or pessary use. Institutional Review Board approval was obtained prior to the start of the study, and all patients signed an informed consent form prior to inclusion.

Fig. 1
Study flow chart showing exclusion criteria, intervention and analysis

Women were examined to determine their POP-Q score and ultrasonography was performed using a previously validated technique. Women were scanned in the lithotomy position whilst performing a Valsalva manoeuvre, within 15 min of emptying their bladder and on confirming by ultrasonography that their bladder contained less than 50 mL of urine. VWT was determined at the bladder neck (VWTBN), at the level of the dome of the bladder (VWTB), and at the anterior fornix (VWTAF), and at the level of the anorectal junction (VWTARJ), the rectum (VWTR) and the posterior fornix (VWTPF), posteriorly. VWT included the full thickness of tissue between the vaginal lumen and the prolapsed pelvic organ (Fig. 2). It was not possible to blind the sonographer to the POP-Q score prior to the ultrasound scan.

Fig. 2
Ultrasound image showing measurement of vaginal wall thickness at the level of the bladder neck i and the anorectal junction ii

Women were grouped according to the severity of prolapse. In women with a POP-Q score of less than −2, the prolapse was considered grade 0, in women with a score of −2 to −1 as grade 1, in women with a score of −1 to 0 as grade 2, and in women with a score greater than 1 as grade 3. Scores were compared to VWT at the three anatomical sites on the anterior and posterior vaginal walls. The primary outcome measure was the relationship between mean VWT and prolapse grade. Secondary outcome measures were the relationship between mean VWT at each of the points anteriorly or posteriorly for different grades of prolapse, and the effect of menopause status on VWT.

Adult urodynamics — stress urinary incontinence (SUI)/prolapse guideline statements specify the following: Clinicians who are making the diagnosis of urodynamic stress incontinence should assess urethral function. (Recommendation; Evidence Strength: Grade C). Surgeons considering invasive therapy in patients with SUI should assess post-void residual (PVR) urine volume. (Expert Opinion). Clinicians may perform multi-channel urodynamics in patients with both symptoms and physical findings of stress incontinence who are considering invasive, potentially morbid or irreversible treatments. (Option; Evidence Strength: Grade C). Clinicians should perform repeat stress testing with the urethral catheter removed in patients suspected of having SUI who do not demonstrate this finding with the catheter in place during urodynamic testing. (Recommendation; Evidence Strength: Grade C). Clinicians should perform stress testing with reduction of the prolapse in women with high grade pelvic organ prolapse (POP) but without the symptom of SUI. Multi-channel urodynamics with prolapse reduction may be used to assess for occult stress incontinence and detrusor dysfunction in these women with associated LUTS. (Option; Evidence Strength: Grade C).

### Incarcerated prolapsed ureterocele complicated by postoperative acute pyelonephritis: a case report [^76dcec31]. BMC Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

The underlying pathogenesis of ureterocele remains unknown, in many cases, ureteroceles can be considered a diverticulum of the distal ureter within the bladder, caused by a stenotic ureteral orifice. Ureteroceles can be asymptomatic or may cause recurrent urinary tract infections, stone formation, and even urine blockage leading to hydronephrosis and renal damage. It is worth noting that in women, a ureterocele may manifest as a vaginal mass due to it prolapse and may also cause urinary incontinence due to the laxity of the external urinary sphincter. Ureterocele prolapse can result in acute urinary retention, urinary tract infection, and vulvar mass. While it is more prevalent in infants and young children and is typically reducible, ureterocele prolapse with incarceration is exceedingly rare and often necessitates urgent medical intervention. In this case, the patient reported that the vulvar mass prolapsed during straining for urination or defecation. This occurs because the size of the ureterocele fluctuates with ureteral spray, and the ureterocele is deformable, thus prolapsing from the urethral opening during urination. For this patient, initially, the prolapsed mass was retractable. Consequently, the physician who initially assessed her focused solely on her urinary incontinence and proceeded with a midurethral sling surgery. Following this surgery, the urethral cavity narrowed. When the ureterocele prolapsed out of the urethral orifice, it became stuck and irretractable back into the bladder, leading to incarceration. Ramart et al. previously documented a similar case of ureterocele prolapse and incarceration following midurethral sling surgery for SUI, making this as the second such report. These cases remind us that the dilation effect of ureterocele prolapse on the urethra may also manifest as urinary incontinence. Therefore, when diagnosing SUI, clinicians must remain vigilant for the potential presence of a ureterocele. A thorough medical history is crucial. A detailed physical examination, including asking the patient to strain or bear down, is an indispensable step. Appropriate radiologic imaging modalities should be employed to identify ureterocele, while confirmatory cystoscopy may be subsequently performed to establish definitive diagnosis and guide potential surgical intervention when clinically indicated. The placement of a midurethral sling decreases urethral compliance, which can lead to incarceration following ureterocele prolapse.

### Is levator ani avulsion a risk factor for prolapse recurrence? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^e9c219d5]. International Urogynecology Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Outcomes

The primary outcomes for the assessment of pelvic organ prolapse surgery have previously been defined in the IUGA/ICS Joint Report on terminology for reporting outcomes of surgical procedures for pelvic organ prolapse. This includes the reporting of subjective patient outcomes, objective outcomes on examination and reoperation for recurrent prolapse. These have been demonstrated to be relevant to both the clinician and the patient. Hence, we have used these three criteria as our three primary outcomes.

Subjective outcome was defined as a positive response to patient awareness of a vaginal bulge. Also, those with a positive response to question 3 on the Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory 20 (PFDI-20) ("Do you usually have a bulge or something falling out that you can see or feel in your vaginal area?") or question 28 on the Australian Pelvic Floor Questionnaire (APFQ) ("Do you have a sensation of tissue protrusion/lump/bulging in your vagina?") or on any other validated pelvic floor questionnaires.

Objective assessment required a clinical finding of prolapse recorded on multisite vaginal assessment or staging using recognised scoring systems such as the Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification (POP-Q) or Baden–Walker Halfway Scoring system. Those with the distal-most portion of the prolapse situated 1 cm above the hymen or lower (ICS/POP-Q ≥ stage 2) are defined as an objective recurrence. Some authors have utilised ultrasound findings to define prolapse recurrence and this has been defined as the finding of the bladder edge ≥ 10 mm below the symphysis pubis on maximum Valsalva. Recurrent prolapse requiring retreatment with a pessary or reoperation was included as the third primary outcome in this analysis.

Secondary outcomes to be evaluated in separate analyses include whether LAMA is a risk factor for prolapse recurrence in specific surgeries (i.e. native tissue, vaginal mesh, abdominal prolapse surgeries and obliterative procedures) or single-site prolapse recurrence.

Assessment of risk of bias

The Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias In Non-Randomized Studies – of Intervention (ROBINS-I) tool was used to assess the risk of bias due to confounding, selection of participants in the study, classification of interventions, deviations from intended interventions, missing data, measurement of outcomes and selection of reported results. This information was presented using the robvis visualisation tool and classified as low, moderate, serious or critical risk. If there was insufficient or no information to enable a score for bias, this was classified as no information.was searched for each study to allow detection of reporting bias.

Impact of various parameters on POP examination

When examining a patient with suspected POP, it is critical that the examiner sees and describes the maximal extent of the POP as experienced by the woman. This may be impacted by many variables including the patient's age, parity, body mass index (BMI), position, bladder volume, rectal fullness, the timing of the day of the examination, examination performed at rest or Valsalva/straining, and effect of anesthesia in the case of examination in operating rooms. The correlation of examination findings with these variables was examined separately in nine studies. The conclusions of these are summarized below.
Age, parity, and BMI: there is no literature on how any of these impacts the ability of a woman to aid in her examination to identify the bothersome extent of her POP.

### Dynamic MR imaging of pelvic organ prolapse: spectrum of abnormalities [^3ac2fbee]. Radiographics (2000). Low credibility.

Pelvic organ prolapse is a relatively common condition in women that can have a significant impact on quality of life. Pelvic organ prolapse typically demonstrates multiple abnormalities and may involve the urethra, bladder, vaginal vault, rectum, and small bowel. Patients may present with pain, pressure, urinary and fecal incontinence, constipation, urinary retention, and defecatory dysfunction. Diagnosis is made primarily on the basis of findings at physical pelvic examination. Imaging is useful in patients in whom findings at physical examination are equivocal. Fluoroscopy, ultrasonography, and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging can be useful in evaluating pelvic organ prolapse. Advantages of MR imaging include lack of ionizing radiation, depiction of the soft tissues of the pelvic floor, and multiplanar imaging capability. Dynamic imaging is usually necessary to demonstrate pelvic organ prolapse, which may be obvious only when abdominal pressure is increased. Treatment is more likely to be successful if a survey of the entire pelvis is performed prior to therapy. Therapy is usually undertaken only in symptomatic patients. In all patients, imaging findings must be interpreted in conjunction with physical examination findings and the patient's symptoms.

### Pelvic prolapse [^512a48e7]. The Journal of Urology (2000). Low credibility.

Purpose

Pelvic prolapse is a common problem affecting women of all ages. We reviewed the pathophysiology, presentation, evaluation and treatment of pelvic prolapse.

Materials and Methods

We comprehensively reviewed the literature using MEDLINE, resources cited in those peer reviewed articles and abstracts from recent international meetings.

Results

Pelvic prolapse involves the herniation of various portions of the vaginal wall. Symptoms vary according to the area of the vagina affected. Proper evaluation is imperative for providing proper treatment. Various surgical approaches to repair have been developed and techniques continue to evolve.

Conclusions

With the increasing involvement of urologists in the treatment of pelvic prolapse it is essential for us to become familiar with the anatomy, and the evaluation and management options available. We provide an overview of the care of patients with pelvic prolapse.

### Urodynamic studies in adults: AUA / SUFU guideline [^eff15461]. The Journal of Urology (2012). Medium credibility.

AUA/SUFU guideline — SUI/Prolapse Guideline Statement 2 states that surgeons considering invasive therapy in patients with SUI should assess PVR urine volume (Expert Opinion), and prior to performing invasive therapy for the treatment of SUI, clinicians should assess PVR urine volume. Although most studies have not demonstrated a clear association between PVR and treatment outcomes, PVR assessment is important; particularly if elevated it can provide valuable information during consideration of treatment options, and an elevated PVR is suggestive of detrusor underactivity, bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) or a combination of both, although the exact clinical definition of "elevated" and the optimal method of measurement remain unclear. Patients with elevated preoperative PVR may be at an increased risk for transient or permanent postoperative voiding difficulties following urethral bulking injection therapy or SUI surgery, and individuals who chronically carry an elevated residual volume or remain in chronic urinary retention are at increased risk of sequelae related to incomplete emptying such as ongoing voiding dysfunction, stone disease and recurrent UTIs. Assessment of postoperative PVR can be helpful in evaluating new onset postoperative voiding dysfunction and, ideally, a preoperative PVR should be available for comparison; although de novo postoperative BOO may not be associated with an elevated PVR in all cases, this finding can be helpful in directing further diagnostic testing and/or treatment. Because assessment of PVR, though generally safe and inexpensive, has pitfalls, a single elevated PVR should not be considered a satisfactory assessment of bladder emptying ability; falsely elevated PVR may result from rapid diuresis or psychogenic inhibition, and an elevated PVR should be confirmed with a second measurement at a subsequent office visit or encounter.

2 Bladder volume and rectal fullness: the effect of bladder volume on examination of POP was evaluated by two studies. Both concluded that the maximal extent of POP should always be assessed with an empty bladder. This could be because a full bladder does not allow maximal straining and also distorts the anatomy of the vaginal wall, especially of the anterior and central compartments. Similarly, a full rectum may cause confounding of findings by competing for space. One study commented that all patients with POP should be examined with an empty rectum if possible. However, there is a lack of evidence to support this.
3 Patient position: there is a lack of standardized recommendations regarding patient position during a POP examination. Three studies examined the effect of patient position on the staging of POP. It was found that the severity of POP demonstrated is greater when the examination is done in the upright position on a birthing chair or in the standing position rather than in the supine or lithotomy position. The inter-observer repeatability and correlation with the quality of life scores were also greater for examination findings in the upright position. In cases where the examination is not possible in an upright position, validation of POP-Q in a left lateral position was also assessed and the authors found a high degree of inter-observer reliability of POP-Q findings in this position.
4 Time of examination: the effect of the time of the day (morning versus afternoon) on POP-Q measurements, was assessed in a prospective observational study on 32 subjects. No correlation was found between time of the day and extent of POP on examination. The authors concluded that for patients complaining of POP extending beyond the hymen there is no need to repeat an examination late in the day to confirm the full extent of prolapse.
5 Rest or straining: one study examined the predictive value of GH and Pb measurements obtained at rest and with straining for signs and symptoms of POP. GH and Pb measured on straining were consistently stronger predictors of prolapse symptoms and objective prolapse (by clinician examination and by ultrasound) than at Gh and Pb measured at rest.
6 Anesthesia/neuromuscular blockade: the effect of neuromuscular blockade on POP staging was examined by one study. It was found that neuromuscular blockade during anesthesia led to a significant increase in POP-Q measurements, especially in the apical compartment. The authors highlighted that in asymptomatic women with up to stage II POP, the surgical procedure should be limited to that planned preoperatively rather than allowing intraoperative findings to affect surgical management.
7 Role of cervical traction in prolapse examination: one study compared the degree of uterine prolapse between POP-Q with cervical traction and POP-Q in the standing position. They also assessed patient-reported pain and acceptability scores between the two examinations. The median point C in the standing position was −4 (−7 to +2) and with cervical traction −0.5 (−3 to +4). Forty percent reported visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores of ≥ 5 under examination with cervical traction. Surprisingly, there was no significant difference in acceptability scores between the groups.

### International urogynecological consultation chapter 2.2: imaging in the diagnosis of pelvic organ prolapse [^d509d318]. International Urogynecology Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

The value of any diagnostic testing is traditionally assessed by non-experimental cross-sectional or cohort studies, which compare a test's classification of a diagnosis with that of a reference standard. The conceptual starting point of a diagnostic test study is to apply the reference (or gold) standard to determine which study participants have the prolapse and which participants do not. In the case of prolapse, the Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification (POP-Q) examination is considered the gold standard among the urogynecology scientific community. However, although this view is widely accepted, it is not universally agreed upon. For example, in the colorectal literature, some studies call for other imaging modalities as a gold standard in assessing POP. The diagnosis of POP is further complicated by the fact that not all prolapse diagnosed by POP-Q is bothersome. Typically, the presence of symptoms is required to identify prolapse as clinically significant. Therefore, diagnostic studies should consider the fact that not all forms of prolapse identified on physical examination or imaging are symptomatic (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
Venn diagram of pelvic organ prolapse (POP) physical findings, symptoms, and imaging findings. POP-Q Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification

A well-designed POP imaging accuracy study will need to include a clear definition of prolapse by POP-Q and symptoms, set up clear definitions of radiological findings identified as positive, calculate sensitivity and specificity, and ideally report likelihood ratio and receiver-operating curves (ROCs), which will allow the derivation of evidence-based cut-offs for this particular diagnostic modality. The area under the curve (AUC) on ROCs defines the accuracy of the test: the closer the AUC approaches 1, the more discriminatory value the test carries in distinguishing prolapse from normal controls. This chapter reviews different imaging techniques available for assessing POP and compares them with the clinical examination findings using a clinical diagnosis of prolapse according to either the POP-Q system or the Baden–Walker (BW) grading system. The BW half-way system preceded POP-Q and consisted of four grades: grade 0, no prolapse; grade 1, halfway to the hymen; grade 2, to the hymen; grade 3: halfway past the hymen; grade 4, maximum descent. It was included in the review to avoid exclusion bias, as the colorectal literature was late to adopt POP-Q and continued using the BW system long after it was introduced in 1994 into the urogynecology community.

### The role of urodynamics in the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms in women [^1fc77cb4]. Current Opinion in Urology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Urodynamic investigation was developed as an extension of patient history and physical examination in order to reveal the pathology of a patient's complaints. Much progress in standardizing definitions and procedures has been made in recent years. In particular, stress urinary incontinence and overactive bladder can be differentiated with urodynamics. The developed parameters, however, cannot distinguish the various types of stress urinary incontinence. Moreover the definition and diagnosis of voiding dysfunction is not clear. Finally our understanding of bladder sensations and the impact on voiding behaviour has only started to emerge. This review is about last year's publications that focus on urodynamics and lower urinary tract symptoms in women.

Recent Findings

Defining bladder outlet obstruction is based on voiding pressure, urinary flow speed and residual urine but standardization is lacking. Urodynamics to reveal occult stress urinary incontinence in patients with pelvic organ prolapse needs standardization of the reducing manoeuvres. The quest for urodynamic tools for distinguishing intrinsic sphincter deficiency from urethral hypermobility continues. Urodynamics are still not good enough to discriminate between treatment options for stress urinary incontinence. The use of urodynamics in overactive bladder is developing and has elicited new findings. Voiding habit seems to be independent from bladder sensations. Also bladder sensations appear to be imperfectly correlated with bladder filling. Even bladder volumes do not predict entirely bladder fullness sensations.

Summary

In order to use urodynamics as a proper clinical tool, defining subtypes of stress urinary incontinence and standardization of urodynamics in pelvic organ prolapse and bladder outlet obstruction in women is needed.

### International urogynecology consultation: patient reported outcome measures (PROs) use in the evaluation of patients with pelvic organ prolapse [^50bd7d07]. International Urogynecology Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

Patient-reported outcome measure instruments include patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and patient-reported goals (PRGs), which allow practitioners to measure symptoms and determine outcomes of treatment that matter to patients.

Methods

This is a structured review completed by the International Urogynecology Consultation (IUC), sponsored by the International Urogynecological Association (IUGA). The aim of this working group was to evaluate and synthesize the existing evidence for PROs and PRGs in the initial clinical work-up/evaluation and research arena for patients with pelvic organ prolapse (POP).

Results

The initial search generated 3589 non-duplicated studies. After abstract review by 4 authors, 211 full texts were assessed for eligibility by 2 writing group members, and 199 studies were reviewed in detail. Any disagreements on abstract or full-text articles were resolved by a third reviewer or during video meetings as a group. The list of POP PROs and information on PRGs was developed from these articles. Tables were generated to describe the validation of each PRO and to provide currently available, validated translations.

Conclusions

All patients presenting for POP should be evaluated for vaginal, bladder, bowel and sexual symptoms including their goals for symptom treatment. This screening can be facilitated by a validated PRO; however, most PROs provide more information than needed to provide clinical care and were designed for research purposes.

This manuscript is a narrative review that includes a systematic search of the literature using terms from the PubMed and Embase databases (January 2000 to August 2020). Only human studies involving adult women and limited to the English language were included. The terms for searching the literature were developed by the authors of this report and were presented to the IUGA membership at the annual scientific meeting in 2020; progress was reported at subsequent meetings. These are shown in Table 1 the titles and abstracts were reviewed using the Covidence database to determine whether they met the inclusion criteria. In the event of uncertainty, this was discussed at regularly scheduled meetings. The manuscripts were next reviewed for suitability using the Specialist Unit for Review Evidence checklists for cohort, cross-sectional, and case–control epidemiological studies. This was done to assess data presentation, population description, and bias. Only studies that included populations with clear definitions of patients with symptomatic POP, which described examination findings, were included. The full-text manuscripts were extracted and then reviewed. Those manuscripts that qualified were reviewed in depth and the process is summarized in the Results section (Fig. 1).

### How to use the pelvic organ prolapse quantification (POP-Q) system? [^9eff8419]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2018). Low credibility.

Aims

To set out the basic description of pelvic organ prolapse (POP) using the International Continence Society/International Urogynecology Association Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification (POP-Q) system.

Methods

The basic approach to use of the POP-Q was identified and summarized.

Results

Six defined points in the vagina are identified; points Aa and Ba for the anterior vagina, Ap and Bp for the posterior vagina, and C and D for the cervix/vault. Point D is not used in women who previously had a hysterectomy. The patient is asked to strain, ideally when in the standing position, to elicit the POP to its maximum extent. The location of the defined points is then gauged relative to the hymenal ring and recorded on a grid. Three additional measurements are taken to achieve a full description; the genital hiatus length, perineal body length, and total vaginal length. Staging a POP relies on identifying the lowest extent of any part of the six defined points; if any point reaches close to the hymenal ring (at least stage 2), the prolapse is usually symptomatic.

Conclusions

The POP-Q system is readily cataloged and offers detailed description of considerable benefit in clinical practice and research.

### Effect of genital prolapse on assessment of bladder neck mobility by the Q-tip test [^4d3a2879]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the effect of vaginal prolapse and bladder fullness on Q-tip test assessment of urethral mobility.

Methods

Twenty-six women with genital prolapse to or beyond the hymen and undergoing urodynamics for urogynecologic dysfunction were assessed by the Q-tip test. Measurements were obtained with the bladder empty, with and without the prolapse reduced by the posterior blade of a Graves speculum. Angles were repeated at bladder capacity. Measured Q-tip angles were compared using the Wilcoxon signed rank test.

Results

Q-tip angles were significantly altered by vaginal prolapse and bladder fullness. With an empty bladder, the median Q-tip angle measured with the prolapse reduced was significantly less than that measured without reduction (53 degrees, interquartile range 25–65, versus 68 degrees, interquartile range 45–75; P < .001). With a full bladder, similar but lesser results were obtained (33 degrees, interquartile range 15–55 [reduced] versus 48 degrees, interquartile range 31–60 [unreduced]; P < .001). The median Q-tip angle with an empty bladder was greater than that with a full bladder. With the prolapse reduced, the Q-tip angle was 53 degrees (interquartile range 25–65) with an empty bladder versus 33 degrees (interquartile range 15–55) with a full bladder (P < .001). Without the prolapse reduced, the median Q-tip angle was 68 degrees (interquartile range 45–75) with an empty bladder and 48 degrees (interquartile range 31–60) with a full bladder (P < .001). CONCLUSION? Measurement of urethral mobility by the Q-tip test is significantly affected by genital prolapse. Q-tip angles are less with the reduction of vaginal prolapse and with the bladder full. Standardization of measurement technique is necessary for the development of clinical management recommendations.

### A case report of single umbilical artery combined with fetal bladder exstrophy in singleton pregnancy and related literature review [^d8f28976]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Differentiating diagnosis

BE is not difficult to diagnose when there is a typical indication of absence of bladder filling. BE should be differentially diagnosed apart from omphalocele, gastroschisis and cloacal exstrophy, patent urachal prolapse with bladder prolapse or patent urachal cyst with allantoic cyst. The former two can show a normal bladder in the pelvis. However, when intestinal, anal atresia, spinal cord abnormalities and external genitalia are present at the same time, cloacal exstrophy should be suspected. The latter two usually exist in isolation, and they often do not appear together with symphysis pubis separation or external genital malformation.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for pelvic organ prolapse, more specifically with respect to assessment of treatment response, BSUG/RCOG 2015 guidelines recommend to recognize that objective cure is important as it correlates to symptoms of vaginal bulge, and a POP-Q stage of I or O in the apical compartment seems to be acceptable and widely used as the optimum postoperative result.

### Microscopic hematuria in adults… [^962fffaa]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Defining Microscopic Hematuria The AUA defines microscopic hematuria as three or more red blood cells per high-power field on urine microscopy. A threshold between three and 10 RBC/HPF has the highest sensitivity for detecting bladder cancer and the lowest negative likelihood ratio. A single urinalysis is sufficient because 95% of microscopic hematuria is detected in one sample. Because at least 20% of positive dipstick tests for blood have no red blood cells on subsequent urine microscopy, any positive dipstick should be confirmed. Initial Evaluation Initial evaluation for patients with microscopic hematuria involves searching for a likely cause to be addressed. Common causes include urinary tract infections, menstruation, external genital lesions, vaginal atrophy, pelvic organ prolapse, urolithiasis, benign prostatic enlargement, and urethral stricture. After addressing any of these issues, a repeat urinalysis should be performed.

With conditions such as prostatic hypertrophy, vaginal atrophy, and pelvic organ prolapse, microscopic hematuria may not completely resolve. In these cases, full evaluation may be warranted. Obtaining a catheter urine sample also may be helpful. For these patients, the guideline recommends cystoscopy and renal ultrasonography. Renal ultrasonography is recommended over computed tomography urography because of reasonable discrimination of cortical lesions, decreased expense, and lack of ionizing radiation. The drawback of renal ultrasonography is poor sensitivity for upper urinary tract cancers. After a Negative Evaluation Based on limited study, malignancy risk is low in patients with a negative microscopic hematuria evaluation. Over 14 years of follow-up of 258 patients, only two bladder cancers were diagnosed. Repeat urinalysis within 12 months of the negative workup should be considered, and evaluation may be discontinued if no microscopic hematuria is found.

The benefits of additional evaluation for recurrent microscopic hematuria are unclear. Urine cytology and urine-based tumor marker testing should be avoided in the initial evaluation of microscopic hematuria. Positive cytology has a 10% false-positive rate and rarely leads to a bladder cancer diagnosis after negative cystoscopy. The role of cytology in the evaluation of persistent microscopic hematuria is unknown. Published source: J Urol. October 2020; 204: 778–786.

### Oestrogen therapy for treating pelvic organ prolapse in postmenopausal women [^135fb2e8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) is the descent of a woman's uterus, bladder, or rectum into the vagina. It affects 50% of women over 50 years old who have given birth to at least one child, and recognised risk factors are older age, higher number of births, and higher body mass index. This review assesses the effects of oestrogen therapy, alone or in combination with other treatments, on POP in postmenopausal women.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of local and systemic oestrogen therapy in the management of pelvic organ prolapse symptoms in postmenopausal women, and to summarise the principal findings of relevant economic evaluations.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Specialised Register (up to 20 June 2022), which includes CENTRAL, MEDLINE, two trials registers, and handsearching of journals and conference proceedings. We also checked the reference lists of relevant articles for additional studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs, multi-arm RCTs, and cross-over RCTs that evaluated the effects of oestrogen therapy (alone or in combination with other treatments) versus placebo, no treatment, or other interventions in postmenopausal women with any grade of POP.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data from the included trials using prespecified outcome measures and a piloted extraction form. The same review authors independently assessed the risk of bias of eligible trials using Cochrane's risk of bias tool. Had data allowed, we would have created summary of findings tables for our main outcome measures and assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

We identified 14 studies including a total of 1002 women. In general, studies were at high risk of bias in terms of blinding of participants and personnel, and there were also some concerns about selective reporting. Owing to insufficient data for the outcomes of interest, we were unable to perform our planned subgroup analyses (systemic versus topical oestrogen, parous versus nulliparous women, women with versus without a uterus). No studies assessed the effects of oestrogen therapy alone versus no treatment, placebo, pelvic floor muscle training, devices such as vaginal pessaries, or surgery. However, we did identify three studies that assessed oestrogen therapy in conjunction with vaginal pessaries versus vaginal pessaries alone and 11 studies that assessed oestrogen therapy in conjunction with surgery versus surgery alone.

Authors' Conclusions

There was insufficient evidence from RCTs to draw any solid conclusions on the benefits or harms of oestrogen therapy for managing POP symptoms in postmenopausal women. Topical oestrogen in conjunction with pessaries was associated with fewer adverse vaginal events compared with pessaries alone, and topical oestrogen in conjunction with surgery was associated with reduced postoperative urinary tract infections compared with surgery alone; however, these findings should be interpreted with caution, as the studies that contributed data varied substantially in their design. There is a need for larger studies on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of oestrogen therapy, used alone or in conjunction with pelvic floor muscle training, vaginal pessaries, or surgery, for the management of POP. These studies should measure outcomes in the medium and long term.

Assessment of preoperative SUI

Stress test: the significance of patient position and prolapse reduction during the cough stress test was demonstrated in a study performed on 297 women waitlisted for POP surgery, with a third of them reporting SUI symptoms. Five different cough stress tests were performed with a subjectively full bladder (standing, semi-lithotomy, with and without reduction, reduction with speculum, and pessary). The test with the fewest positive results (34%) was the one performed without POP reduction in a semi-lithotomy position; the test with the most positive results (80%) was the one performed with pessary reduction in a semi-lithotomy position. With the full battery of tests, 93% of women with SUI symptoms demonstrated leakage; only 50% demonstrated leakage without reduction. Eighty-nine percent of the women with a positive stress test were diagnosed when performing at least two of the three tests with prolapse reduction, and 98% were diagnosed when performing all three tests with prolapse reduction (speculum and pessary reduction in the semi-lithotomy position, pessary reduction in the standing position). The authors also emphasized the importance of adequate bladder volume (200 ml). The findings were not compared with postoperative outcomes.
Q-tip angle: one study concluded that the Q-tip test is affected by POP. The angles were smaller with the prolapse reduced and with a full bladder. A substantial correlation (r = 0.68) between POP-Q point Aa and Q-tip angle was noted in a study on women presenting predominantly with SUI and anterior wall prolapse.
Importance of urodynamic studies in the assessment of preoperative SUI: one study concluded that a computer-based model including preoperative symptoms and patient's baseline characteristics cannot predict preoperative urodynamic diagnosis and, as a consequence, cannot replace a preoperative urodynamic study. In another retrospective study, preoperative urodynamic testing in patients with POP changed the management or counseling in only 3% (11 out of 316) in a cohort of women, with the indication for the study being OAB symptoms, mixed, or insensible urinary incontinence, or voiding difficulty (i.e. not occult SUI evaluation only). Major management alterations occurred mostly in women with SUI and concurrent voiding difficulty. The authors inferred that it might be in these patients that preoperative urodynamic study has its greatest value. These two studies did not correlate the preoperative examination with postoperative outcomes.

Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) surgery — indications and approach selection: Surgery is indicated for the treatment of POP in women who are bothered by their POP and have failed or declined nonsurgical treatments. There are various vaginal and abdominal surgical approaches, and important considerations for deciding the type and route include the location and severity of prolapse, symptom nature (eg, urinary, bowel, or sexual dysfunction), the patient's general health, patient preference, and the surgeon's expertise.

### The AUA / SUFU guideline on adult neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction: diagnosis and evaluation [^0a1af52e]. The Journal of Urology (2021). High credibility.

Adult neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction (NLUTD) — post-void residual (PVR) definition, measurement, and follow-up — has no universally agreed definition, and in NLUTD there is no definite upper limit defining normal or a lower limit defining abnormal; a volume of greater than 300 cc has been suggested as a definition for non-neurogenic chronic urinary retention. An elevated PVR that could be associated with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), urinary tract infection (UTI), or upper tract deterioration is generally considered abnormal and should prompt further evaluation with multichannel UDS and treatment as indicated. PVR can be measured by transabdominal bladder scanner, real-time ultrasound (US), or urethral catheterization; catheterization is the most accurate but most invasive, and the accuracy of transabdominal US may be compromised by factors such as obesity, prior lower abdominal or pelvic surgery, ascites or pelvic cysts, and vaginal prolapse. A single elevated PVR may not reflect emptying ability and should be confirmed with a second measurement at another visit; a PVR should be performed at the time of diagnosis and may be checked periodically thereafter, recognizing that some NLUTD patients cannot empty on command and that a low PVR does not absolutely exclude significant NLUTD risk.

Endovaginal Ultrasound

Two studies describing endovaginal ultrasound use in POP diagnosis focused on two different aspects of POP. Lone et al. aimed to assess if ultrasound findings can aid in diagnosing additional POP, which would lead to a change in planned surgical intervention. They concluded that clinical examination is better at diagnosing cysto-urethrocele, rectocele, and uterine prolapse. In addition, endovaginal ultrasound also diagnosed two intussusceptions and a combined enterocoele and intussusception in one woman, but overall did not have an impact in the planned management approach. Athanasiou et al. reported on the ability of endovaginal ultrasound to assess the levator hiatal area and correlated it with POP-Q findings. The authors concluded that the hiatal area, and not levator thickness, is in strong correlation with POP-Q measurements in all compartments.

Transabdominal Ultrasound

One study that utilized the transabdominal ultrasound technique, attempted to use it to diagnose paravaginal defects. The role of the paravaginal defect in POP is debated in the literature and the defect itself is not adequately reflected by the POP-Q measuring system. The authors attempted to evaluate if the lateral bladder base "sagging" below level of the central bladder correlates with the physical examination diagnosis of a paravaginal defect established with the use of ring forceps reducing the apical prolapse. The authors concluded that the sonographic paravaginal defects identified in this study were artificially created by the ultrasound technique, utilizing a balloon placed in the vagina to enhance vaginal forces. Hence, this technique cannot accurately diagnose paravaginal defects.

Conclusion

The diagnostic value of endovaginal and endoanal ultrasound is limited to the detection of enterocele, likely because insertion of the probe into the vaginal or rectal cavity distorts the descent of the prolapsing organs by adding a space-occupying effect. There is no adequately described transabdominal ultrasound technique that can aid the diagnosis of prolapse.

### Epidemiology and outcome assessment of pelvic organ prolapse [^c6063dc0]. International Urogynecology Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

The aim was to determine the incidence and prevalence of pelvic organ prolapse surgery and describe how outcomes are reported.

Methods

Every 4 years and as part of the Fifth International Collaboration on Incontinence we reviewed the English-language scientific literature after searching PubMed, Medline, Cochrane library and Cochrane database of systematic reviews, published up to January 2012. Publications were classified as level 1 evidence (randomised controlled trials [RCT] or systematic reviews, level 2 (poor quality RCT, prospective cohort studies), level 3 (case series or retrospective studies) and level 4 (case reports). The highest level of evidence was utilised by the committee to make evidence-based recommendations based upon the Oxford grading system. A grade A recommendation usually depends on consistent level 1 evidence. A grade B recommendation usually depends on consistent level 2 and/or 3 studies, or "majority evidence" from RCTs. A grade C recommendation usually depends on level 4 studies or "majority evidence" from level 2/3 studies or Delphi processed expert opinion. A grade D "no recommendation possible" would be used where the evidence is inadequate or conflicting and when expert opinion is delivered without a formal analytical process, such as by Delphi.

Results

Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) when defined by symptoms has a prevalence of 3–6% and up to 50% when based upon vaginal examination. Surgery for prolapse is performed twice as commonly as continence surgery and prevalence varies widely from 6 to 18%. The incidence of POP surgery ranges from 1.5 to 1.8 per 1,000 women years and peaks in women aged 60–69. When reporting outcomes of the surgical management of prolapse, authors should include a variety of standardised anatomical and functional outcomes. Anatomical outcomes reported should include all POP-Q points and staging, utilising a traditional definition of success with the hymen as the threshold for success. Assessment should be prospective and assessors blinded as to the surgical intervention performed if possible and without any conflict of interest related to the assessment undertaken (grade C). Subjective success postoperatively should be defined as the absence of a vaginal bulge (grade C). Functional outcomes are best reported using valid, reliable and responsive symptom questionnaires and condition-specific HRQOL instruments (grade C). Sexual function is best reported utilising validated condition-specific HRQOL that assess sexual function or validated sexual function questionnaires such as the Pelvic Organ Prolapse/Incontinence Sexual Questionnaire (PISQ) or the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI). The sexual activity status of all study participants should be reported pre- and postoperatively under the following categories: sexually active without pain, sexually active with pain or not sexually active (grade C). Prolapse surgery should be defined as primary surgery, and repeat surgery sub-classified as primary surgery different site, repeat surgery, complications related to surgery and surgery for non-prolapse-related conditions (grade C).

Conclusion

Significant variation exists in the prevalence and incidence of pelvic organ prolapse surgery and how the outcomes are reported. Much of the variation may be improved by standardisation of definitions and outcomes of reporting on pelvic organ prolapse surgery.

To optimally perform a physical examination on a patient with suspected POP several parameters should be met:
The subject should have an empty bladder (and empty rectum, if possible.
If the subject cannot confirm the extent of their POP by examination in the supine or left lateral position, the examination should be repeated in a more upright or standing position.
The time of day of the examination is not important in most cases.
The examination should be done during straining or coughing.
Cervical traction or examination under the effects of a neuromuscular blockade may overstate the degree of apical POP and should not be relied upon.

Other parameters of a thorough pelvic examination and imaging for pelvic anatomy are less well investigated but may provide some clinical assistance in planning therapy.
Noting the dimensions of the GH or vaginal introitus plays a role in the evaluation of a patient with POP. A large GH as documented by a POP-Q examination ≥ 3.75 cm is associated with greater degrees of POP. Understanding what information this provides to the clinician in staging and quantifying POP is less clear and requires more study. Of note, recording the size of the GH is part of the POP-Q but not the S-POP.
A greater pelvic floor muscle contraction strength has been associated with less severe POP by both POP-Q examination and various POP symptom scores. In addition, patients with POP appear to have some degree of neurological deficit in other pelvic structures. Therefore, evaluating and recording pelvic floor muscle contraction strength and the presence or absence of neurological deficits, although encouraged, does not currently play a recognized role in the evaluation or quantification of POP.
Evaluation of the spine in patients with POP may lead to better understanding of the epidemiology and pathophysiology of POP but does not play any specific role in the evaluation of patients with POP.
Clinical examination to identify and characterize site-specific defect of the anterior vaginal wall prolapse has not been studied enough to draw robust conclusions. However, although reporting these clinical findings may aid the individual surgeon in preoperative planning, is too nonspecific for widespread adoption into current clinical grading schemes.
Evaluation of posterior vaginal wall prolapse can be complemented by a rectovaginal examination as there is evidence that it can help to distinguish between true rectoceles and enteroceles. There is poor correlation between posterior vaginal prolapse by clinical examination and GI dysfunction.
Evaluation and grading of apical (cervical/vaginal vault) POP is complex and currently there is very little information from which to draw clinically relevant information. It appears that in normal subjects the cervix (POP-Q point C) is 4.5 to 7.5 cm above the hymenal remnants, the posterior vaginal fornix (POP-Q point D) is 7 to 10 cm above the hymenal remnants, and in hysterectomized patients the vaginal cuff (POP-Q point C in hysterectomized patients) is 6 to 8.5 cm above the hymen. The TVL in patients with a uterus is 8.5 to 11 cm and in hysterectomized patients it is 7.5 to 10.5 cm. The determination of a cut-off point beyond which apical values represent true POP or clinical symptomatic disease is unknown although any compartment prolapse at or beyond the hymen is more likely to be symptomatic.
Repeating a POP-Q examination under anesthesia often overestimates apical prolapse and although useful for surgical planning, currently should not be recommended. It is not known whether there is a long-term prognostic value for this apical assessment.
Using a tenaculum to provide traction on the cervix in the clinical setting can overestimate uterine prolapse, is deemed uncomfortable by patients, and therefore should be discouraged.

Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification (POP-Q) staging — recording the stage of prolapse should use the POP-Q, which is recommended by the American Urogynecologic Society, the Society of Gynecologic Surgeons, the International Urogynecological Association, and the International Continence Society. The 9-item POP-Q is a topographical assessment describing and measuring locations of specific points on the vaginal surface in relation to the hymen on maximal strain, and there is also a validated 4-item simplified POP-Q that closely approximates the original 9-item system.

Pelvic organ prolapse surgery — setting expectations and stress urinary incontinence options — Patients may incorrectly assume that correcting their prolapse will address all urinary and bowel symptoms, so limitations of surgery should be discussed, including that symptoms may not resolve completely even if anatomy is corrected; it may be reasonable to offer stress urinary incontinence surgery to women with anterior vaginal wall prolapse without stress urinary incontinence, but there are additional risks associated with these procedures, which the patient should understand before reaching a decision.

Assessment of voiding dysfunction in women with POP

The prevalence of voiding dysfunction in women with prolapse varies depending on the definition but ranges from 6 to 60%. Assessment of voiding difficulty in women with prolapse was addressed in 11 papers. Six papers had voiding difficulty as the focus, 4 papers addressed voiding difficulty as part of LUTS assessment, and 1 paper addressed the accuracy of ultrasound in measuring bladder volume. Six themes were identified in these studies.

Post-void residual urine volume

Post-void residual urine volume (PVR) was the most utilized measure to define voiding dysfunction in the studies reviewed; however, there was no agreement on the cut-off value at which retention was diagnosed ranging from 50 to 200 ml, as shown in Table 5.

Table 5
Measures for the assessment of voiding difficulty

Qmax maximum flow rate, Pdet Max maximum detrusor pressure as measured during pressure flow studies, Pdet Qmax pressure detrusor at maximum flow rate, DU detrusor underactivity

To find a cut-off value for PVR that could predict postoperative voiding trial results more accurately than a predetermined value of 100 ml, one study used a receiver operating curve, but no PVR value was better than 100 mL (the predetermined value used in the study).

The accuracy of translabial ultrasound scan formulae used for PVR measurement in patients with prolapse was examined in one paper. It found that the results obtained by the three published formulae correlated with the catheter-measured PVR.

Urine flow studies

These included free-flow studies (non-instrumented flow studies) and pressure-flow studies (instrumented urodynamic flow studies). Different measurements were used to define voiding dysfunction, as shown in Table 5.

One study examined the correlation between free-flow and pressure-flow studies. It concluded that the peak and average flow rates in women with POP are dependent on voided volume and the correlation between free-flow and pressure-flow studies decreases as the prolapse stage increases.

### Does patient posture affect the ultrasound evaluation of pelvic organ prolapse? [^ad78b6fa]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Translabial ultrasound (US) imaging is an emerging method for the evaluation of pelvic organ prolapse (POP). Normative data to date are limited to imaging in the supine position. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of posture changes on US pelvic organ mobility.

Methods

This work was a retrospective study of 175 women seen in a tertiary urogynecologic center for symptoms of lower urinary tract and pelvic floor dysfunction. All underwent a standardized interview, POP quantification prolapse assessment, and 4-dimensional translabial US examination in supine and standing positions. Offline measurement of organ descent on the Valsalva maneuver was undertaken at a later date and was blinded against all other data.

Results

The mean age was 58 (SD, 13.5; range, 17 to 89) years, with a mean body mass index of 29 (SD, 6.1; range, 18 to 53) kg/m 2. In total, 58.9% (n = 103) presented with symptoms of prolapse. Clinically, 82.8% (n = 145) had substantial prolapse on the POP quantification assessment. On imaging, bladder, uterine, and rectal ampulla positions were significantly lower, and the hiatal area on the Valsalva maneuver was larger in the standing position (P < .03). On receiver operating characteristic statistics assessing correlations between POP symptoms and US pelvic organ descent, the area under the curve was higher in the standing position, but the difference was not statistically significant.

Conclusions

Measurements of organ descent and hiatal dimensions are generally higher in the standing position. However, they are not reflected in a stronger association between symptoms and organ descent. Hence, imaging in the standing position can be limited to those patients in whom a false-negative assessment result is suspected.

### Pelvic organ prolapse [^a231d2cb]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

The separate disease entities that are included in the general term of pelvic organ prolapse have been discussed in detail in this chapter. The focus of discussion centered on the pathophysiology and clinical presentation of these conditions. At this point, the emergency physician should be able to properly recognize, assess, initiate treatment, and obtain appropriate referral in cases of pelvic organ prolapse. Postoperative complications commonly seen after these entities are repaired have also been reviewed to help the emergency medicine physician recognize and mange common postoperative complications.
