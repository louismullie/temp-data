## Question

What kind of pancreas tests can you run

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what kind of pancreas tests can be run. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical contexts that drive testing, namely acute pancreatitis, chronic pancreatitis, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, and pancreatic cancer. Then, I should verify the major test categories and their evidentiary standing. Next, I will examine indirect function tests, followed by direct function tests, and then imaging-based approaches. After that, I need to check special populations and scenarios, and finally synthesize a practical, stepwise algorithm with caveats and limitations, ensuring I anchor each point to guidelines and key reviews.

> Let me first confirm the clinical contexts that shape test selection, because I need to ensure I'm not mixing indications. Acute pancreatitis relies on biochemical markers and supportive imaging, chronic pancreatitis leans on imaging with function testing as adjuncts, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency is best screened with noninvasive function tests, and pancreatic cancer generally requires cross-sectional imaging rather than blood-based screening in average-risk adults, with function testing reserved for suspected EPI rather than cancer detection per se [^b690cbde] [^c1e6c66c] [^ac46ac29] [^facbbee6].

> Next, I should review the major test categories and their hierarchy of evidence. Indirect, noninvasive function tests are first-line for EPI screening, direct stimulatory tests are accurate but invasive and reserved for select cases, imaging is central for structural disease and complements function testing, and serum enzymes are primarily for acute pancreatitis rather than chronic disease or EPI screening, so I need to keep these buckets distinct to avoid misapplication [^ac46ac29] [^97c6abe8] [^c1e6c66c] [^b690cbde].

> I will now examine indirect function tests, starting with fecal elastase-1, because I should confirm thresholds and preanalytical pitfalls. Fecal elastase-1 on a semi-solid or solid stool is the recommended initial test for EPI, with less than 100 mcg/g strongly suggestive and 100–200 mcg/g indeterminate; watery stools can falsely lower values, and importantly, PERT does not interfere with FE-1, so results are valid even on enzyme therapy, though repeating FE-1 to gauge treatment response is not helpful [^ac46ac29] [^1f5a353e] [^0e8a5a6a]. Wait, let me verify sensitivity in mild disease; yes, FE-1 has limited sensitivity in early or mild EPI, which is why indeterminate results need clinical correlation or alternative testing rather than reflex PERT [^9745231d] [^735f3f4d].

> Hold on, I should verify alternatives when FE-1 is indeterminate or unavailable. The 13C–mixed triglyceride breath test is a validated, noninvasive alternative that measures intraluminal lipase activity; it has good sensitivity in moderate to severe EPI but is less available in the U.S. and requires several hours of breath collection, so I need to ensure local access before recommending it [^d271b626] [^94e0d684] [^43e5a1b0]. I initially thought stool chymotrypsin might be a first-line substitute, but wait, I should double-check; it is less specific and not preferred over FE-1 in most guidelines, so I should not overstate its role [^notfound].

> Next, I should review direct pancreatic function tests, and I need to be careful not to overgeneralize their use. Endoscopic pancreatic function testing and traditional secretin-CCK stimulation tests directly measure acinar and ductal output and can detect earlier disease than indirect tests, but they are invasive, resource-intensive, and not first-line for EPI; they are mainly used when the diagnosis of early chronic pancreatitis remains uncertain after noninvasive imaging and indirect tests, or in specialized pediatric settings [^97c6abe8] [^c1e6c66c] [^51b9adc9]. Let me reconsider availability; yes, they are limited to select centers, and shortened collection protocols can compromise accuracy, so I should caution against abbreviated variants unless validated locally [^e12200d6] [^6fb0b273].

> I will now examine imaging-based tests, because I need to ensure I'm aligning modality with question. For chronic pancreatitis, cross-sectional imaging with CT or MRI/MRCP is foundational to identify calcifications, ductal changes, atrophy, or pseudocysts, with endoscopic ultrasound offering high sensitivity for early parenchymal and ductal abnormalities when noninvasive studies are equivocal; for suspected EPI, imaging helps identify the underlying pancreatic disease but cannot itself diagnose EPI, so I should not imply otherwise [^c1e6c66c] [^598d9c5b] [^7926d7ac]. For pancreatic cancer, CT or MRI are the primary diagnostic modalities in symptomatic patients, and routine blood-based screening is discouraged in asymptomatic, average-risk adults due to poor accuracy and potential harms from false positives, so I should not conflate cancer detection with EPI testing [^facbbee6].

> But wait, what about serum pancreatic enzymes for chronic disease or EPI screening; I should clarify their role. Serum amylase and lipase are for suspected acute pancreatitis, where lipase is preferred and a value at least three times the upper limit of normal supports the diagnosis; they are not reliable for diagnosing chronic pancreatitis or EPI, and low serum amylase may correlate with chronic pancreatitis but lacks sensitivity and should not be used as a standalone diagnostic test for EPI [^c8e33566] [^b690cbde] [^11a1b94e]. I need to ensure I don't overinterpret marginal enzyme changes in chronic disease, as that would mislead management [^notfound].

> Next, I should review special populations and scenarios, starting with cystic fibrosis. In CF, annual fecal elastase-1 testing is recommended in infants and children, with confirmation of a positive result by a second test within 3 months, and in pancreatic-sufficient adults with higher-risk genotypes, periodic FE-1 surveillance is reasonable; this cadence differs from non-CF EPI workups, so I should explicitly note the indication-specific pathway [^7471558e] [^7c51f78f] [^d9a5328d]. Hold on, I should verify post-pancreatic surgery nuances; after total pancreatectomy, EPI is assumed and FE-1 is not used to diagnose EPI, whereas after pancreaticoduodenectomy, FE-1 can be misleading due to altered anatomy, so clinical context guides PERT initiation without relying on FE-1 in those settings [^b72908f3].

> I should also consider acute pancreatitis follow-up, because I need to ensure we don't miss evolving EPI. After an episode of acute pancreatitis, guidelines recommend monitoring for EPI at 3, 6, and 12 months with symptoms, nutrition, and FE-1, then every 6–12 months if persistent, given the risk of delayed exocrine dysfunction; this is a distinct surveillance pathway that clinicians often overlook [^bca4f6bf]. Let me double-check that this applies even after mild disease; yes, the recommendation is risk-stratified follow-up rather than assuming recovery in all cases [^bca4f6bf].

> Now, I will synthesize a practical algorithm, but I should confirm each branch against guidelines. In patients with steatorrhea, weight loss, or maldigestion, start with fecal elastase-1 on a formed stool; if less than 100 mcg/g, diagnose EPI and initiate PERT with fat-soluble vitamins and dietary counseling; if 100–200 mcg/g, correlate clinically and consider repeat FE-1, a 13C-MTG breath test where available, or direct testing if early CP is suspected; if greater than 200 mcg/g, EPI is unlikely and other causes of malabsorption should be pursued, recognizing FE-1's limited sensitivity in mild disease [^ac46ac29] [^1f5a353e] [^d271b626]. For suspected chronic pancreatitis, prioritize cross-sectional imaging first; if imaging is normal or equivocal and suspicion remains high, proceed to direct pancreatic function testing in a specialized center, and use FE-1 as an adjunct rather than a diagnostic arbiter for CP itself [^c1e6c66c] [^598d9c5b]. For acute pancreatitis, obtain serum lipase and manage acutely; reserve function testing for later surveillance if symptoms of EPI emerge [^c8e33566] [^bca4f6bf].

> I need to ensure I address treatment response monitoring, because clinicians often ask whether to repeat FE-1. Repeat FE-1 is not recommended to assess PERT response; instead, monitor clinical outcomes such as reduction in steatorrhea, weight and muscle mass recovery, and improvement in fat-soluble vitamin levels, aligning with guideline-based success metrics for EPI therapy [^0e8a5a6a] [^42544f04] [^2e0e1e93]. Hold on, I should verify that this applies across etiologies; yes, the principle is consistent in AGA and European guidance and should be emphasized to avoid unnecessary testing [^0e8a5a6a] [^2e0e1e93].

> Finally, I should acknowledge limitations and what would change practice. There is no perfect test for early EPI or minimal-change chronic pancreatitis, FE-1 loses sensitivity in mild disease, direct tests are invasive and not broadly available, and breath tests remain limited by access and standardization; emerging biomarkers and standardized ePFT protocols may shift practice, but current care should rely on guideline-concordant, context-specific testing rather than any single assay [^9745231d] [^97c6abe8] [^43e5a1b0]. I should double-check that my bottom line aligns with high-credibility sources; the AGA and UEG recommendations consistently support FE-1 first for EPI, imaging-first for CP, and judicious use of direct tests, which anchors the algorithm I've outlined [^ac46ac29] [^d271b626] [^c1e6c66c].

Pancreas tests fall into **three main categories**: laboratory tests (serum amylase/lipase, fecal elastase-1, fecal fat, 13C-mixed triglyceride breath test), imaging (CT, MRI/MRCP, EUS, ERCP), and direct pancreatic function tests (secretin/CCK stimulation, endoscopic pancreatic function test) [^c1e6c66c] [^d271b626]. Fecal elastase-1 is the **first-line test** for exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) [^ac46ac29], while serum amylase/lipase are used for acute pancreatitis [^c8e33566]. Imaging is used to detect structural disease (chronic pancreatitis, tumors) [^7926d7ac], and direct tests are reserved for complex or early disease [^97c6abe8]. Test selection depends on clinical context, availability, and patient factors [^e88e1323].

---

## Laboratory tests

### Serum enzymes

- **Amylase and lipase**: Elevated ≥ 3× ULN supports acute pancreatitis; lipase is more specific and remains elevated longer than amylase [^b690cbde] [^c8e33566].
- **Trypsin**: May reflect pancreatic inflammation but is unreliable in ongoing pancreatitis; not routinely used [^0e8a5a6a].

---

### Indirect pancreatic function tests

- **Fecal elastase-1 (FE-1)**: Noninvasive first-line test for EPI; < 100 µg/g indicates severe EPI, 100–200 µg/g is indeterminate, and > 200 µg/g is normal; not affected by PERT [^ac46ac29] [^1f5a353e].
- **Fecal fat (qualitative or quantitative)**: Qualitative Sudan staining is simple; quantitative 72-hour collection is the gold standard for steatorrhea but impractical [^fdd05d97].
- **13C-mixed triglyceride breath test**: Noninvasive, measures lipase activity; high sensitivity but limited availability and long duration (4–6 h) [^23b9f9ee] [^94e0d684].

---

## Imaging studies

| **Modality** | **Indications** | **Advantages** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| CT scan | - Acute pancreatitis <br/> - Chronic pancreatitis <br/> - Tumors | - Widely available <br/> - Good for calcifications <br/> - - Necrosis <br/> - Pseudocysts | Radiation exposure <br/> Limited sensitivity for early CP [^notfound] |
| MRI/MRCP | - Chronic pancreatitis <br/> - Tumors <br/> - Ductal anomalies | - No radiation <br/> - Superior soft-tissue contrast <br/> - Detailed ductal mapping | Limited availability <br/> Contraindications (e.g. pacemaker) [^notfound] |
| Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) | - Early CP <br/> - Small tumors <br/> - Cysts | - High sensitivity for early CP <br/> - Minimally invasive | Operator-dependent <br/> Limited availability [^notfound] |
| ERCP | - Therapeutic ductal interventions <br/> - Complex strictures | - Therapeutic capability <br/> - Detailed ductal imaging | Invasive <br/> Risk of pancreatitis <br/> Limited use for diagnosis [^notfound] |

## Direct pancreatic function tests

Direct tests measure stimulated pancreatic output and are the **most accurate** for early EPI or CP but are invasive and available only in specialized centers [^97c6abe8]. The **secretin stimulation test** evaluates ductal bicarbonate secretion and is the historical gold standard, whereas the **endoscopic pancreatic function test (ePFT)** is a modern, less invasive alternative that measures bicarbonate and enzymes during endoscopy [^2ab5836d] [^41df14d6].

---

## Test selection by clinical scenario

- **Acute pancreatitis**: Serum amylase/lipase; CT for severity/complications [^b690cbde].
- **Chronic pancreatitis**: MRI/MRCP or EUS; FE-1 for EPI; direct tests if early disease suspected [^598d9c5b] [^ac46ac29] [^97c6abe8].
- **Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency**: FE-1 first-line; 13C-breath test or fecal fat if indeterminate [^ac46ac29] [^d271b626].
- **Pancreatic cancer**: CT/MRI/EUS for diagnosis/staging; no reliable blood test for screening [^facbbee6].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Fecal elastase-1**: Insensitive in mild EPI; false lows with watery stools [^9745231d] [^4210594f].
- **Direct tests**: Invasive, resource-intensive, limited availability [^97c6abe8].
- **Imaging**: Early CP or small tumors may be missed; operator/technique dependent [^7926d7ac].

---

Pancreas tests span laboratory, imaging, and direct function tests, with **fecal elastase-1** as the primary screen for EPI and **amylase/lipase** for acute pancreatitis. Imaging detects structural disease, and direct tests are reserved for complex or early cases. Test choice should match the clinical question, availability, and patient factors [^e88e1323].

Abstract

Pancreatic diseases pose significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenges necessitating robust biomarkers for accurate diagnosis, management, and monitoring of pancreas function.Pancreas function can be measured with direct (invasive) and indirect tests. However, neither approach allows for continuous disease monitoring to identify disease progression or therapeutic response. We demonstrate literature evidence suggesting that trypsin, an important pancreatic digestive enzyme, holds promise as a continuous biomarker. On one hand, assessment of trypsin concentration in the serum sensitively and specifically detects pancreas inflammation; whereas on the other hand, declining trypsin levels in serum show good correlation with direct pancreatic function tests to identify exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. With this comprehensive review, we aimed to evaluate the existing evidence on the utility of trypsin as a continuous biomarker, spanning from acute to chronic pancreatitis and pancreas function, highlighting its potential in monitoring disease evolution on an individual patient level.

### American Pancreatic Association practice guidelines in chronic pancreatitis: evidence-based report on diagnostic guidelines [^df45e6be]. Pancreas (2014). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis remains challenging in early stages of the disease. This report defines the diagnostic criteria useful in the assessment of patients with suspected and established chronic pancreatitis. All current diagnostic procedures are reviewed, and evidence-based statements are provided about their utility and limitations. Diagnostic criteria for chronic pancreatitis are classified as definitive, probable, or insufficient evidence. A diagnostic (STEP-wise; survey, tomography, endoscopy, and pancreas function testing) algorithm is proposed that proceeds from a noninvasive to a more invasive approach. This algorithm maximizes specificity (low false-positive rate) in subjects with chronic abdominal pain and equivocal imaging changes. Furthermore, a nomenclature is suggested to further characterize patients with established chronic pancreatitis based on TIGAR-O (toxic, idiopathic, genetic, autoimmune, recurrent, and obstructive) etiology, gland morphology (Cambridge criteria), and physiologic state (exocrine, endocrine function) for uniformity across future multicenter research collaborations. This guideline will serve as a baseline manuscript that will be modified as new evidence becomes available and our knowledge of chronic pancreatitis improves.

### AGA clinical practice update on the epidemiology, evaluation, and management of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency: expert review [^26a8b1cb]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Update—diagnostic evaluation of EPI emphasizes that the fecal elastase test is the most appropriate initial test and must be performed on a semi-solid or solid stool specimen, with a fecal elastase level <100 μg/g of stool providing good evidence of EPI and levels of 100–200 μg/g being indeterminate. Fecal elastase testing can be performed while on pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy, whereas fecal fat testing is rarely needed and must be performed when on a high-fat diet and quantitative testing is generally not practical for routine clinical use. A response to a therapeutic trial of pancreatic enzymes is unreliable for EPI diagnosis. Cross-sectional imaging methods cannot identify EPI, and breath tests and direct pancreatic function tests are not widely available in the United States.

### Breath testing for the diagnosis of pancreatic disease [^43e5a1b0]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Pancreatic function tests are mainly used for the diagnosis of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) in patients with pancreatic diseases or after pancreatic or gastric surgery. Breath tests evaluate not just pancreatic secretion but the digestion capacity of the pancreas. These tests are good candidates for the diagnosis of EPI as they are noninvasive, accurate and easy to apply to clinical practice.

Recent Findings

The C-labelled mixed triglyceride (MTG) breath test has been optimized and validated against adequate reference methods for the diagnosis of EPI in patients with chronic pancreatitis and for the evaluation of the efficacy of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT). In addition, reported C-MTG breath test results in patients with other pancreatic diseases and after pancreatic and gastric surgery support the accuracy and clinical applicability of this test. The evidence of pancreatic function breath tests with other C-labelled substrates is limited.

Summary

Increasing evidence supports the accuracy and clinical usefulness of the C-MTG breath test for the diagnosis of EPI and the evaluation of the efficacy of PERT in different clinical conditions. Commercial availability of this test is required for a wide clinical use. The use of optimized and validated breath test protocols is mandatory.

### ACG clinical guideline: chronic pancreatitis [^8a13f7be]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Key concepts—diagnosis, etiology, and natural history in chronic pancreatitis: pancreatic function testing is an important means of diagnosing exocrine pancreatic insufficiency; however, its role in establishing the diagnosis of CP is complementary; in patients with clinical features of CP, a comprehensive review of all risk factors should be performed, which provides information on mechanisms, identifies fixed and modifiable risk factors, potential targets for therapies, and prognostic information; identification of the disorder(s) underlying pancreatic inflammation is important in predicting progression to CP; the development of DM in CP is most likely related to duration of disease, although other etiologic factors such as BMI and smoking status may incur an increased risk; there is a lack of evidence to suggest that performing screening examinations on patients with CP to detect pancreatic malignancy is beneficial.

### Practical guide to exocrine pancreatic insufficiency-breaking the myths [^5ba3fdd8]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) is characterized by a deficiency of exocrine pancreatic enzymes, resulting in malabsorption. Numerous conditions account for the etiology of EPI, with the most common being diseases of the pancreatic parenchyma including chronic pancreatitis, cystic fibrosis, and a history of extensive necrotizing acute pancreatitis. Treatment for EPI includes dietary management, lifestyle changes (i.e. decrease in alcohol consumption and smoking cessation), and pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy.

Discussion

Many diagnostic tests are available to diagnose EPI, however, the criteria of choice remain unclear and the causes for a false-positive test are not yet understood. Despite multiple studies on the treatment of EPI using exogenous pancreatic enzymes, there remains confusion amongst medical practitioners with regard to the best approach to diagnose EPI, as well as dosing and administration of pancreatic enzymes.

Summary

Appropriate use of diagnostics and treatment approaches using pancreatic enzymes in EPI is essential for patients. This opinion piece aims to address the existing myths, remove the current confusion, and function as a practical guide to the diagnosis and treatment of EPI.

### Endoscopic pancreatic function testing (ePFT) in children: a position paper from the NASPGHAN pancreas committee [^47019898]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Endoscopic pancreatic function testing (ePFT) is one of the few ways to directly diagnose exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, and considerable confusion regarding indications, utility, and interpretation of the test remains. This position paper of the Pancreas Committee of the North American Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition reviews the history and indications for ePFT in children. We compare various methods in current practice and determine their strengths and limitations, and based on data from children and adults we provide guidance on a protocol on how to perform ePFT in children. Lastly, we pose areas in need of further research relating to ePFT in children.

Purpose Of Review

Pancreatic functional status has a very strong effect on outcome in cystic fibrosis and pancreatic insufficiency requires lifelong treatment with pancreatic enzymes. Traditionally, clinical signs and symptoms have been used to decide who should be treated with pancreatic enzyme supplements; however, recent studies show that patients with cystic fibrosis are both undertreated and over-treated using this approach. This paper reviews recent progress in the development of noninvasive, indirect tests of pancreatic function for use as diagnostic tools for patients with cystic fibrosis.

Recent Findings

Breath testing using C-labeled fat and measurement of several pancreatic enzymes in stool, such as chymotrypsin, lipase, and elastase have been explored as ways to define pancreatic functional status. Fecal elastase has good sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive value for defining severe pancreatic insufficiency in patients with cystic fibrosis and appears to be more useful than measurement of other fecal enzymes. Its role in milder pancreatic insufficiency and in disease states other than cystic fibrosis, such as chronic pancreatitis, is less clear.

Summary

Several new noninvasive, indirect tests of pancreatic function have been developed to aid in the definition of pancreatic functional status in patients with cystic fibrosis. An objective measure of pancreatic functional status should be obtained in all patients with cystic fibrosis, and the recent development of new screening tools such as fecal elastase makes this feasible.

### Is a 15-minute collection of duodenal secretions after secretin stimulation sufficient to diagnose chronic pancreatitis? [^e12200d6]. Pancreas (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Standard hormonal stimulation tests of pancreatic function use a 60- to 90-minute collection of pancreatic secretions. A shorter 15-minute collection time has been proposed to increase the feasibility of the secretin stimulation test. The accuracy of this brief collection period for the diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis has not been well defined.

Methods

We retrospectively evaluated the accuracy of a 15-minute collection period by comparing the results of 633 complete standard secretin tests (60 minutes) to the result using only the first 15-minute collection of the same test. The gold standard used for the diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis was the final result of the complete 60-minute secretin stimulation test.

Results

The specificity of the first 15-minute collection was 34.6% (95% CI, 30.03%-39.21%). The positive predictive value was 44.9% (95% CI, 40.5%-49.3%). The accuracy was 57.3% (95% CI, 53.01% 59.34%).

Conclusions

Using only the first 15-minute collection period in a standard 60-minute secretin test is inaccurate in the diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis.

Best practice advice 9—breath tests and direct pancreatic function tests: Best Practice Advice 9: Breath tests and direct pancreatic function tests hold promise, but are not widely available in the United States. Breath tests were developed to measure intestinal digestion of mixed triglycerides in which the carbons are radiolabeled with 13C or 14C; these isotope-labeled triglycerides are digested by pancreatic lipase and co-lipase and the 13CO2 or 14CO2 are released, exhaled, and measured in expired breath, with digestion in humans requiring a collection of breath over many hours. This technique is more widely used in Europe. An alternative approach developed in the United States is to deliver an oral substrate that is digested and used to measure the products of digestion in the blood, and the ratio of the 2 fatty acids in the blood provides a measure of pancreatic enzyme–specific digestion; similar to the breath test, the blood test takes many hours. Both tests measure digestive activity rather than enzyme quantity, and these can be repeated on PERT therapy to measure efficacy.

Jin J. Screening for Pancreatic Cancer. JAMA. 2019; 322:

478. doi:
10. 1001/jama.
2019. 10776 The US Preventive Services Task Force has recently published recommendations on screening for pancreatic cancer in adults. Pancreatic cancer can be detected by an imaging test of the abdomen, such as with computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or a special type of ultrasound via a scope that goes through the mouth and the stomach into the small intestine. Although some blood tests can have abnormal results in pancreatic cancer, these have not been shown to be accurate enough to diagnose the disease. This USPSTF recommendation applies to adults who have no signs or symptoms of pancreatic cancer and who are not at higher risk of pancreatic cancer because of strong family history or having certain inherited genetic syndromes.

A strong family history means having 2 or more first-degree relatives who have had pancreatic cancer. The goal of screening for cancer is to find it early and prevent death from that cancer. Unfortunately, for pancreatic cancer, there is no evidence that screening-detected early-stage cases are any less lethal than cases that are detected later. Therefore, the benefits of screening for pancreatic cancer are small. Given how uncommon pancreatic cancer is, screening for it is more likely to yield false-positive results. These false-positive results are associated with some harm, as they lead to further unnecessary testing that may include invasive procedures and sometimes even surgery. Based on current evidence, the USPSTF concludes that the potential benefits of screening for pancreatic cancer in asymptomatic adults do not outweigh the potential harms.

### ACG clinical guideline: chronic pancreatitis [^9745231d]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Chronic pancreatitis—limitations of pancreatic function testing and fecal elastase cutoffs: The sensitivity of pancreatic function testing to make the diagnosis of CP is low, reflecting that only significant loss of function (usually >90%) results in clinically apparent symptoms. Fecal elastase is most commonly used; the accuracy of fecal elastase to detect EPI depends on the cutoff chosen, with some studies using <200 μg/g stool that has a high false-positive rate, whereas lowering the cutoff of <100 μg/g improves specificity but lowers sensitivity. Practical clinical approach: Having EPI does not independently establish the diagnosis of CP, and testing for EPI therefore should be used as an ancillary test for patients in whom the diagnosis of CP has not been previously established.

### (13) C breath tests for the assessment of exocrine pancreatic function [^c7d40c0d]. Pancreas (2010). Low credibility.

The secretin-pancreozymin test is regarded as the most accurate of the pancreatic exocrine function tests but is cumbersome, time consuming, and invasive because it requires duodenal intubation and hormonal stimulation of the pancreas. Fecal analysis of fat, fecal elastase, or chymotrypsin are more practicable but far less sensitive to detect early stages of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency. Several (13)C-labeled substrates that are digested by pancreatic enzymes have been proposed for breath tests, thus assessing the intraluminal activity of pancreatic enzymes and therewith the pancreatic exocrine function. Particularly in pediatrics, (13)C breath tests are suited not only for diagnosis of pancreatic exocrine disorder, but also for therapy control under pancreatic enzyme substitution. However, the costs of substrates, the high time expenditure, and the lack of standardization still limit the clinical use of these breath tests. This review aims to place into perspective the traditional pancreatic exocrine function tests and the newer (13)C breath tests.

Pancreatic function tests (PFTs)—sensitivity and scope relative to imaging are contrasted. In adults, secretin stimulation tests are more sensitive in detecting early stages of chronic pancreatitis (CP) than newer imaging; imaging studies are usually able to detect CP only when >50% of the gland is fibrotic, whereas some PFTs can detect damage involving as little as 30% of the pancreas. The types of PFTs can be divided into indirect nonstimulatory tests and direct stimulatory tests.

### Endoscopic pancreatic function testing (ePFT) in children: a position paper from the NASPGHAN pancreas committee [^8650861a]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2021). High credibility.

Endoscopic pancreatic function testing in children—exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) is defined as a decrease from normal pancreatic enzyme or bicarbonate secretion, or both, in the small intestine that interferes with digestion and absorption, and cystic fibrosis is the most common cause of EPI of childhood. Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) is described as the most common treatment for EPI but may not be the necessary treatment for nonpancreatic causes of maldigestion or isolated enzyme deficiencies. Common indications for pancreatic function testing include evaluating for EPI in patients with steatorrhea, chronic diarrhea, or failure to thrive; defining the extent of pancreatic function in patients with cystic fibrosis; ruling out chronic pancreatitis (CP) in patients with inconclusive imaging findings or, with discretion, in children with unremitting, chronic abdominal pain; and assessment for specific isolated/individual pancreatic enzyme deficiencies.

### ACG clinical guideline: chronic pancreatitis [^c1e6c66c]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline: Chronic Pancreatitis—current concepts emphasize that chronic pancreatitis (CP) was historically defined as an irreversible inflammatory condition with exocrine and endocrine dysfunction, but now the most accepted mechanistic definition is a pathologic fibroinflammatory syndrome in individuals with genetic, environmental, and/or other risk factors who develop persistent pathologic responses to parenchymal injury or stress. The most common symptom is abdominal pain, with other symptoms such as exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and diabetes developing at highly variable rates. CP is most commonly caused by toxins such as alcohol or tobacco use, genetic polymorphisms, and recurrent attacks of acute pancreatitis, although no history of acute pancreatitis is seen in many patients. Diagnosis is made usually on cross-sectional imaging, with modalities such as endoscopic ultrasonography and pancreatic function tests playing a secondary role. Total pancreatectomy represents the only known cure for CP, although difficulty in patient selection and the complications inherent to this intervention make it usually an unattractive option, and the diagnostic paradigm has changed to focus on diagnosing the underlying pathologic process early and managing the syndrome more holistically to change the natural course of disease and minimize adverse effects.

### Practical guide to exocrine pancreatic insufficiency-breaking the myths [^1f5e58bc]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) is defined by a deficiency of exocrine pancreatic enzymes resulting in an inability to maintain normal digestion. This inadequate digestion with nutrient and, especially, fat malabsorption occurs when intraduodenal levels of lipase fall below 5–10% of normal enzyme output, leading to pancreatic steatorrhea, weight loss, and a potential decrease in quality of life. Furthermore, in EPI, due to cystic fibrosis (CF) or chronic pancreatitis, there is decreased bicarbonate output causing a lower intestinal pH, which precipitates bile salt acids and impairs micelle formation of fats. Fat maldigestion is compounded by decreased pancreatic secretion of lipase and colipase, further dampening hydrolysis of intraluminal fat.

A myriad of tests for EPI have been developed over the years, however, the choice of which to use remains unclear as does the understanding of causes for a false-positive test. In addition, there is significant confusion over dosing and administration of pancreatic enzymes. This opinion piece aims to address the existing myths, remove the current confusion, and function as a practical guide to the diagnosis and treatment of EPI.

### Functional assessment of pancreatic β-cell area in humans [^3e6ba093]. Diabetes (2009). Low credibility.

Given this technical inability to monitor changes in β-cell mass in humans, functional tests of insulin secretion may provide a feasible alternative. However, to be useful for clinical purposes, such a test would need to 1) be sufficiently practicable to allow for the repeated examination of large patient numbers and 2) predict β-cell mass with high accuracy.

The oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) has commonly been applied to detect disturbances in glucose homoeostasis in patients at risk of or with overt diabetes, and different indexes of insulin secretion have been derived from the OGTT. An even less complicated assessment of β-cell function may be derived from indexes based on fasting glucose and insulin measurements, such as the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) index. However, because of the lack of accessibility of the human pancreas for routine biopsy sampling, the accuracy of these indexes for the prediction of β-cell mass has not yet been determined in humans. This question is of great clinical relevance for the design and interpretation of future clinical trials about the natural course of β-cell loss in type 1 and type 2 diabetes, the impact of various treatments on β-cell mass and turnover, and the time course of β-cell loss after pancreas or islet transplantation. Therefore, we examined patients with an oral glucose load before they underwent pancreatic surgery. Different measures of insulin secretion were determined and related to the fractional β-cell area in the pancreatic tissue that was collected at surgery. By these means, we addressed the following questions: 1) Does pancreatic β-cell area predict glycemic control in humans? 2) Do established indexes of β-cell function predict pancreatic β-cell area in humans? and 3) Which measure of insulin secretion and glucose control derived from a prolonged OGTT shows the closest association with β-cell area?

6.4 Non-invasive pancreatic function testing

These tests assess pancreatic enzymes or the consequences of maldigestion by measurement of stool, serum, urine or breath. The tests include fat, elastase and chymotrypsin measurement in stool, urine tests requiring detection of markers in urine or breath released from the gut and absorbed following digestion of synthetic substrate by pancreatic enzymes. All of these tests require significant loss of pancreatic function before becoming positive, with poor sensitivity and specificity in mild/early pancreatic disease.

6.4.1 Urine and breath tests

The two tests (NBTP and pancreolauryl) previously in use are now of largely historical interest as neither, to our knowledge, is in use in the UK due to their poor sensitivity and specificity.

Equally, while European guidelines have recommended the use of the C13 mixed triglyceride breath test as an alternative to faecal elastase testing, it is not widely available with poor sensitivity in mild/moderate diseaseand therefore not recommended.

### Pancreatic function after acute biliary pancreatitis: does it change? [^c349d523]. World Journal of Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

According to the Cambridge and Marseilles symposia, morphologic and functional recovery from acute biliary pancreatitis (ABP) occurs if the initial cause and complications are eradicated. Nevertheless, in recent years there has been controversy over this topic, and varying results have been reported. These differing results may be due to different diagnostic methods, number of patients studied with regard to etiologic factors, severity of the disease, and differences in the tests used. A total of 63 ABP patients [17 male (27%), 46 female (73%); 45 mild, 18 severe] were prospectively studied. All patients underwent cholecystectomy. No patient in this series underwent necrosectomy or pancreatectomy. During the acute phase the severity of the disease was assessed following the Atlanta criteria, and the occurrence and rate of necrosis were determined by dynamic computed tomography. Exocrine and endocrine pancreatic functions were assessed at 1 month, 6 months, and 1 year after the ABP episode by means of various pancreatic function tests. We evaluated the occurrence of pancreatic failure following ABP and if this deficiency was associated with the severity of the episode. According to the classic symposia criteria, the study showed no deficit in exocrine or endocrine pancreatic function. No statistically significant differences were found when the pancreatic function and severity of the process were assessed.

### Chronic pancreatitis [^4bb577b8]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Clinicians are learning more about chronic pancreatitis but are entering an era of some confusion, primarily driven by uncovering new etiologies of chronic pancreatitis. Ideally, this knowledge will lead to better diagnosis and treatment, and abandonment of ill-conceived treatments. In contrast with previous reviews, this review highlights select contributions this year that may develop into true advances in chronic pancreatitis.

Recent Findings

Small steps have been made to understand better the molecular basis of chronic pancreatitis. Diagnosis of early chronic pancreatitis remains challenging. Rapid diagnosis by combining endoscopy and a direct stimulatory test of pancreatic function may lead to more widespread use of function testing, but this test is not ready for clinical use. Application of microarray and proteomic technologies may aid future diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis. The failure to account clearly for the phenotype of patients with chronic pancreatitis may confound delineating the etiologies of chronic pancreatitis. Clinical description and studies of autoimmune pancreatitis have led to the realization that steroids are an effective treatment for this form of chronic pancreatitis. Genetic-based studies have provided insight into the pathogenic mechanisms of chronic pancreatitis. Investigation of the role of stellate cells, an essential component fibrogenesis, has led to identification of potential novel treatments for chronic pancreatitis.

Summary

Ongoing basic and clinical research this past year has characterized further the histologic, genetic, molecular, and clinical aspects of chronic pancreatitis, efforts that may translate into novel therapies once well-designed, controlled studies have been performed.

### Diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency [^6e6d16ba]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Pancreatic exocrine insufficiency (PEI), defined as a secretion of pancreatic enzymes and bicarbonate insufficient to maintain a normal digestion, is a frequent but frequently underdiagnosed and undertreated condition. PEI may be secondary to different pancreatic diseases and extrapancreatic conditions. Recent data support the high clinical relevance of PEI and its treatment.

Recent Findings

Together with symptoms of maldigestion, PEI is associated with nutritional deficiencies leading to osteoporosis, low-trauma fractures, sarcopenia and increased mortality. No single widely available test allows to diagnose PEI accurately. Diagnosis of PEI requires the evaluation of symptoms, nutritional markers and a noninvasive pancreatic function test in the appropriate clinical context. Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) improves digestion, symptoms, nutritional status and quality of life of patients with PEI. In addition, PERT is associated with a longer survival in patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer and after surgery for pancreatic cancer or chronic pancreatitis.

Summary

Awareness of PEI in different clinical conditions is required. Nutritional advice and appropriate PERT are mandatory to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with PEI. Further studies on the clinical impact of PEI and its treatment are needed, especially in diseases other than chronic pancreatitis and cystic fibrosis.

The search was conducted on Medline and Embase databases until November 2022. After identifying relevant titles, abstracts were read and data of eligible articles retrieved. The conditions associated with low serum amylase were evaluated. The quality of the studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Score.

Results

Our search strategy identified 19 studies including a total of 15097 patients for systematic review. All the studies were observational including two studies which used secretin-induced test. The main conditions associated with low serum amylase were diabetes mellitus (n=9), metabolic syndrome (n=3), chronic pancreatitis (CP) (n=3), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (n=2) and obesity (n=1). Low serum amylase showed a high specificity (94%) with low sensitivity (38.7%-59%) in diagnosing chronic pancreatitis.

Conclusion

This systematic review revealed a unique insight into the relevance of low serum amylase in clinical practice. Low serum amylase can be a useful adjunct test in the assessment of patients with CP, pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for acute pancreatitis, more specifically with respect to additional laboratory tests, WSES 2019 guidelines recommend to recognize that:

- hematocrit > 44% represents an independent risk factor of pancreatic necrosis

- urea > 20 mg/dL represents an independent predictor of mortality

- procalcitonin is the most sensitive laboratory test for detection of pancreatic infection, and low serum values are strong negative predictors of infected pancreatic necrosis.

### Guidelines for the investigation of chronic diarrhoea in adults: British society of gastroenterology, 3rd edition [^82745743]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

6.1 Fat malabsorption

Pancreatic exocrine insufficiency can lead to malabsorption (or more correctly maldigestion) and diarrhoea due to impairment of pancreatic enzyme and bicarbonate secretion. In adults, this is usually the result of chronic pancreatitis, pancreatic carcinoma or pancreatic surgery. Maldigestion of fat can result in steatorrhoea and weight loss but may not be clinically apparent. Steatorrhoea can be caused by small bowel malabsorption and clinical assessment of steatorrhoea (eg, by stool inspection) is unreliable.Symptoms of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency usually develop 10–15 years after first symptoms of chronic pancreatitis and when secretion of lipase and other pancreatic enzymes is reduced to <10% of normal values. The diagnosis of advanced chronic pancreatitis in patients presenting with diarrhoea is often suggested by the clinical history and confirmed with imaging. A number of recent guidelines outline the current strategies for diagnosing chronic pancreatitis.There are international variations in practice depending on the availability of various modalities such as endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and direct pancreatic function tests. However, there is a broad agreement that invasive direct pancreatic function testing has become largely redundant in routine clinical practice, replaced by indirect pancreatic function testing and imaging. It is also recognised that there is currently no ideal test to diagnose chronic pancreatitis in early/mild disease.

Chronic pancreatitis—pancreatic function test characteristics (Table 4): Direct hormonal tests include the CCK stimulation test (acinar cell stimulation measuring trypsin and/or lipase), which assesses direct acinar cell function and is a 2–3 hr test with procedural drawbacks, and the secretin stimulation test (ductal cell stimulation measuring bicarbonate), which uses a laboratory autoanalyzer, includes a 60 min test, and measures ductal secretory ability. Nonhormonal tests include the 13C-mixed triglyceride test, which is easily obtainable with high sensitivity (90%) but is not universally available and has a long test duration—4–6 hr; fecal elastase-1 is universally available, easily obtainable, and noninvasive but has moderate sensitivity with limited specificity in diarrhea and limited use in mild disease.

Endoscopic pancreatic function testing in children—indirect pancreatic function testing draws from multiple specimen types: stool (fecal fat testing; fecal elastase-1 or chymotrypsin), serum (immunoreactive trypsinogen, fat‑soluble vitamins, vitamin B12, essential fatty acids), breath tests, and urine (pancreolauryl testing). Indirect testing is stated to be less sensitive and specific compared with direct function tests, and newer modalities such as breath tests offer promise but are currently cumbersome and not widely available.

### Laboratory diagnostic tests in acute pancreatitis [^1680af3c]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis depends on a combination of clinical assessment and laboratory testing. Although the serum amylase is the cornerstone laboratory test used in establishing the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, there are limitations in the sensitivity and specificity that may be important for the clinician to recognize. The serum lipase level may be especially useful in patients with alcohol-induced acute pancreatitis. A new urinary test strip that uses trypsinogen-2 may have a role in establishing the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. In addition, several new laboratory tests and new interpretations of old laboratory tests may assist in establishing the etiology and severity of acute pancreatitis. This review summarizes important aspects of standard laboratory tests and novel laboratory approaches in establishing the diagnosis, etiology, and severity of acute pancreatitis.

### Towards the ideal quantitative pancreatic function test: analysis of test variables that influence validity [^6fb0b273]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2006). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Although pancreatic stimulation tests quantify acinar and ductal exocrine pancreatic function, no standard methodology exists. We evaluated the impact of several variables on test accuracy.

Methods

We performed a retrospective analysis of pancreatic stimulation tests, which involved continuous stimulation with cholecystokinin and secretin, 3 sampling periods (20-min each), and perfusion markers to correct for intestinal losses. Results were recalculated using the following variables: no correction for losses; shortened sampling time (20-min); no correction and shortened sampling time; and enzyme concentration. We examined how these variables influenced measurements of pancreatic secretion and classification of pancreatic function status (sufficient or insufficient).

Results

We analyzed 363 tests in control patients (20), and patients with cystic fibrosis (137), Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (40), or other pancreatic or intestinal disorders (166). Recovery of pancreatic juice varied markedly between tests (median, 59%; range, 4%-106%) and was significantly poorer during the first 20-minute period compared with the 2 subsequent periods (P < .01). Failure to correct for intestinal losses underestimated secretory capacity (median trypsin output reduced by >50%, P < .0001) and shortened sampling time increased test variability. Both variables together resulted in greater discrepancies. More than 25% of the pancreatic-sufficient patients with impaired pancreatic function were misclassified as pancreatic insufficient when uncorrected output plus a shortened sampling time or enzyme concentration were used to define categories.

Conclusions

Pancreatic function tests using brief aspiration periods without marker perfusion or measures of concentration greatly underestimate pancreatic secretory capacity and misclassify the clinical status of an unacceptably large number of patients.

### Diagnostic performance of imaging modalities in chronic pancreatitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^7926d7ac]. European Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Chronic pancreatitis (CP) is a disabling inflammatory disease of the pancreas characterized by severe recurrent or continuous abdominal pain and considerable impact on the quality of life. Patients with CP usually develop endocrine and exocrine insufficiency during the course of the disease as a result of the progressive loss of pancreatic parenchyma.

There is lack of international consensus regarding the initial diagnosis of CP, particularly at its early stages. The diagnosis is often made by a combination of clinical symptoms (e.g. abdominal pain, malabsorption, diabetes mellitus), pancreatic function tests (e.g. fecal elastase-1) and morphological abnormalities seen on imaging (e.g. calcifications, ductal lesions, pseudocysts). Imaging plays a key role in the diagnosis and therapeutic management of patients with CP. The most frequently used imaging modalities for CP are endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS), endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT) and ultrasonography (US).

The aim of this meta-analysis was to determine the diagnostic accuracy of imaging modalities for the initial diagnostic assessment of CP.

### Where have all the dreiling tubes gone? [^2ab5836d]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

The direct measurement of pancreatic function remains the best tool for diagnosing chronic pancreatitis, especially if imaging tests are normal or inconclusive. The most effective means of measuring pancreatic function is the standard hormone stimulation test using secretin. Traditionally, direct pancreatic function testing involves the fluoroscopic placement of an oroduodenal tube and collection of duodenal fluid containing pancreatic secretions after administration of a standardized dose of secretin and/or CCK. The test is time-consuming and tedious to perform, and placement of the oroduodenal tube is often difficult for the person performing the test and uncomfortable for the patient. Bicarbonate concentration typically has been measured by back-titration, requiring specialized equipment no longer found in most hospital clinical chemistry laboratories. For these reasons, the direct testing of pancreatic function after secretin stimulation has become a much admired but rarely performed test, currently done in only a few centers in the United States. In this issue of the Journal, Stevens et al. report on a cross-over study of secretin-stimulated endoscopic pancreatic function test (ePFT) and dreiling tube pancreatic function test (D-PFT) in healthy subjects and demonstrate that the accuracy of the ePFT is comparable to that of the D-PFT (17). They have demonstrated the relative simplicity and reliability of ePFT, bringing it closer to the diagnostic armamentarium of the practicing physician. We may have lost the Dreiling tube but, in its place, gained a "gold standard" which will be more widely used.

### Endoscopic pancreatic function testing (ePFT) in children: a position paper from the NASPGHAN pancreas committee [^41df14d6]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2021). High credibility.

Endoscopic pancreatic function testing (ePFT) in pediatrics—advantages include that it is safe, technically easy, and quick to perform in conjunction with routine esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), allows assessment of acinar and ductal function, has high sensitivity and specificity for detecting isolated and generalized enzyme deficiencies, and can diagnose minor and more severe degrees of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) and aid in early diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis (CP) in patients with unremarkable radiological changes. Disadvantages are that it can be done only in conjunction with EGD with likely need for sedation, prolongs routine EGD, assesses peak enzyme activity and bicarbonate concentrations rather than total secretory capacity, and lacks standardized pediatric fluid collection frequency/duration and age‑specific standardized reference ranges.

- consider evaluating patients with one or more class IV-VI mutations, known to be associated with a low prevalence of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, upon suspected EPI development.

### ACG clinical guideline: chronic pancreatitis [^a9fbf9b1]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Histologic evaluation in chronic pancreatitis—diagnostic role and limitations include that the sensitivity of histologic evaluation for CP when tissue is available, compared with morphologic evaluation, is often no better than chance, and there are no RCTs, systematic reviews, or meta-analyses, which treat histologic evaluation as the diagnostic gold standard for CP; histologic evaluation should only be considered in high-risk patients after clinical, functional, and imaging tests have not established the clinicopathologic diagnosis and a thoughtful informed consent process has been had with the patient; under the current clinicopathologic approach, histology is the gold standard test to diagnose CP and is often used to “rule out” CP, but both imaging and histology are biomarkers of an underlying disorder that may or may not be true CP, and thus, the sensitivity of histology to make the diagnosis is low.

### The role of endoscopy in benign pancreatic disease [^598d9c5b]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2015). Medium credibility.

Chronic pancreatitis (CP)—diagnostic use of endoscopy is outlined as follows: Endoscopy, including EUS, ERCP, and endoscopic pancreatic function testing (ePFT) can be used to establish the diagnosis of CP; however, these modalities should be reserved for patients in whom the diagnosis remains unclear after noninvasive imaging (CT or MRI with or without cholangiopancreatography). The clinical diagnosis of CP is obvious in patients with overt exocrine or endocrine dysfunction or in those with imaging demonstrating organ atrophy or calcification, yet a significant subset of individuals with suspected CP do not have symptoms of pancreatic insufficiency or radiographic abnormalities, and endoscopic investigation has been suggested if noninvasive imaging is equivocal for the diagnosis of CP.

### Diagnostic accuracy of a short endoscopic secretin test in patients with cystic fibrosis [^74400c88]. Pancreas (2015). Low credibility.

The “criterion standard” direct pancreatic function tests have good diagnostic accuracybut are cumbersome, time consuming, and technically difficult. These tests have not reached widespread use and are not suitable as screening tools. New short direct endoscopic tests have been evaluated in other pancreatic diseases. – Short endoscopic tests have been criticized for measuring peak concentrations and not outputs of bicarbonate and digestive enzymes. Hence, the validity of such tests in evaluating CF pancreatic disease, where hyperconcentration is a part of the mechanism, has been questioned.We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of our timed short endoscopic secretin test (EST) using FE as a standard for exocrine failure in a population of patients with CF with a high prevalence of pancreatic sufficiency and healthy controls (HCs).

### ESPGHAN and NASPGHAN report on the assessment of exocrine pancreatic function and pancreatitis in children [^9b6c16ea]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2015). Medium credibility.

Pancreatic stimulation test (Dreiling tube test)—This test is considered the criterion standard for assessing exocrine pancreatic function; after a baseline collection, secretin, 0.2 μg/kg during 1 minute, may be infused, and in combination regimens CCK is infused 30 minutes after secretin, with intestinal secretions typically collected every 15 minutes for 1 hour, specimens kept on ice and expeditiously frozen, and analyses often focusing on peak bicarbonate concentration; interpretation can be confounded by mixing of gastric acid, accurate volume measurement may require a double-lumen tube with continuous infusion of a known concentration of a nonabsorbable marker, and despite detecting mild or at least moderate EPI the test is invasive, impractical, not available in most centers, requires radiation exposure for tube/balloon verification, and can be laborious.

### Modern diagnostics of chronic pancreatitis [^cca56077]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2002). Low credibility.

Chronic pancreatitis is a well-defined disease on histopathological grounds, but for clinical purposes diagnosis is generally not based on histological specimens. Imaging procedures, non-invasive or with different degrees of invasiveness, and pancreatic function tests are therefore the diagnostic mainstay in patients with suggestive clinical history. The correct diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis is easy in late stages but difficult in an early stage of the disease. A particular challenge is the differentiation between acute or recurrent acute and early chronic pancreatitis. Earlier classifications (Cambridge and Marseille) did not consider the complex interrelationship between (especially alcoholic) acute and chronic pancreatitis. A possible solution is to separate the entities into probable and definite alcoholic chronic pancreatitis, with the assignment into the latter category achieved by follow-up investigations. Up to now the best diagnostic accuracy at an early stage is achieved by the detection of abnormalities of the ductal system in endoscopic retrograde pancreatography or by assessing exocrine function with the secretin-ceruletide test. The endoscopic ultrasound may substitute the endoscopic retrograde pancreatography as superior imaging modality that detects both parenchymal and ductal changes of chronic pancreatitis at an early stage. Magnetic resonance pancreatography is a further promising diagnostic tool without the risk of pancreatitis after endoscopic retrograde pancreatography, but imaging of the side branches, which is crucial for detection of early chronic pancreatitis, is not yet sufficient. Faecal elastase is a progress in non-invasive testing of exocrine pancreatic function, but its value for the diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis under conditions of clinical practice is limited. Several (13)C breath tests have been developed, but their availability and their diagnostic accuracy in chronic pancreatitis is still limited. Light to moderate exocrine pancreatic insufficiency is not detectable with adequate accuracy by tubeless function tests. A specific serum marker of pancreatic fibrosis which would reliably indicate the presence of chronic pancreatitis or its progression to is not available.

### The role of fecal elastase-1 in detecting exocrine pancreatic disease [^b66b2914]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2011). Medium credibility.

Exocrine pancreatic disease is thought to be uncommon in clinical practice and usually secondary to excess alcohol intake. Although excess alcohol intake does account for many cases of exocrine pancreatic disease, other conditions are associated with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and such dysfunction perhaps occurs more frequently than conventionally expected. A reliable, patient-friendly, cheap and easy to use test for exocrine pancreatic disease is yet to be established; however, in many countries the main (and often only available) method of assessment of exocrine pancreatic function is the fecal-elastase-1 test. This Review examines the role of fecal-elastase-1 testing in detecting exocrine pancreatic insufficiency in a number of gastrointestinal and nongastrointestinal conditions and determines the value of pancreatic enzyme supplementation in these settings.

Results

Definition and diagnosis of PEI

Statement 1.1: PEI is defined as a reduction of pancreatic exocrine activity in the intestine at a level that prevents normal digestion (grade 1C; 100% agreement)

There is now agreement across pancreatic societies, globally, for this definition.The most common cause of PEI is CP due to loss of functioning pancreatic parenchyma and reduced secretion. Although PEI due to loss of functioning pancreatic parenchyma is also the result of pancreatic cancer, pancreatic resections and CF, other mechanisms exist. Decreased secretion can result from duct obstruction (eg, in periampullary tumour), or secondary causes, such as reduced endogenous stimulation (eg, in small bowel inflammation) and postprandial asynchrony (eg, after gastric surgery).

Statement 1.2: Although the coefficient of fat absorption is regarded as the gold-standard diagnostic test for PEI, we recommend that the faecal pancreatic elastase (FEL-1) test is a suitable first-line test for PEI (grade 1B) (note this was not submitted for consensus voting)

Comments

A number of tests have been used for the diagnosis of PEI, including the coefficient of fat absorption (CFA), direct pancreatic function test (PFT), indirect 13 C-labelled mixed triglyceride breath test and secretin injection at magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (sMRCP).These tests are not used in routine clinical practice in the UK,although some, particularly the CFA and direct PFT, are used in controlled clinical studies.

FEL-1 is used in clinical practice as it is less invasive and readily available. FEL-1 is a measurement of a pancreatic exocrine-specific enzyme that is not degraded in the bowel lumen, is concentrated during intestinal passage and reflects the total overall pancreatic secretion. FEL-1 testing requires a small amount of faecesand is stable at room temperature for 3 days.A FEL-1 result of <200 µg/g stool suggests moderate PEI, while <100 µg/g suggests severe PEI. The sensitivity of an FEL-1 level of <200 µg/g for PEI, when tested in patients with known risk factors, has been shown to be 25%–65% in mild PEI; 33%–100% in moderate PEI and 82%–100% in severe PEI. The specificity of an FEL-1 level of <200 µg/g has been shown to be 55%–100% (although 6 out of 7 studies show specificity >90%).
