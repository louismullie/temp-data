## Question

A 62-year-old woman presents to the emergency department after a fall onto her outstretched hand. X-rays reveal a dorsally displaced, extra-articular distal radius fracture with an associated minimally displaced ulnar styloid fracture. The distal radioulnar joint is stable on clinical and radiological assessment. The fracture is closed and can be reduced by closed manipulation. The orthopedic team is considering surgical management.

Based on current BSSH guidelines, what is the most appropriate surgical management for this patient's distal radius fracture, and how should the associated ulnar styloid fracture be managed?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the most appropriate surgical management for a 62-year-old woman with a dorsally displaced, extra-articular distal radius fracture and a minimally displaced ulnar styloid fracture, with a stable distal radioulnar joint, and how to manage the ulnar styloid component. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the fracture pattern and stability. Then, I should verify the patient's age and functional context. Next, I will review guideline-based indications for surgery and the recommended fixation method. After that, I need to check the evidence comparing fixation techniques. Finally, I will examine the management of the ulnar styloid and synthesize a practical, guideline-concordant plan with follow-up considerations.

> Let me first confirm the injury pattern and stability. This is a dorsally displaced, extra-articular distal radius fracture with a minimally displaced ulnar styloid fracture and a clinically and radiographically stable distal radioulnar joint, which suggests the DRUJ stabilizers are intact and the ulnar styloid fragment is unlikely to be a key stabilizer in this case [^111gJqD3].

> Wait, let me verify the age and functional context. At 62 years old, she sits just below the 65-year threshold often used in guidelines as a proxy for activity level, so she is technically "non-geriatric" and may accrue benefit from operative fixation if radiographic criteria are met, though I should be cautious not to overgeneralize and must weigh comorbidities and preinjury function [^112HaYJb] [^116zonNS].

> I need to check the indications for surgery. According to AAOS/ASSH guidance, operative treatment is favored in non-geriatric patients when post-reduction radial shortening exceeds 3 mm, dorsal tilt exceeds 10 degrees, or there is intra-articular displacement or step-off greater than 2 mm, because surgery improves radiographic and patient-reported outcomes in this group. Given the description of dorsal displacement, it is reasonable to suspect at least dorsal tilt beyond 10 degrees, though I should confirm the exact measurements before concluding [^112HaYJb] [^116zonNS] [^111Kmunn].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about fixation method. I initially thought volar locking plate might be the default, but wait, I should verify what BSSH recommends for a reducible, extra-articular dorsally displaced fracture. BSSH advises K-wire fixation plus casting when surgery is indicated for dorsally displaced distal radius fractures that can be reduced closed, which fits this scenario precisely [^1158ngUh].

> Next, I should review the comparative evidence to ensure K-wires are reasonable. High-quality randomized trials show no clinically meaningful difference in 1-year functional outcomes between K-wire fixation and volar locking plate fixation for dorsally displaced distal radius fractures, with K-wires being faster and less expensive. This supports choosing K-wires when a good closed reduction is achievable and the articular surface is not severely comminuted [^11176P7n] [^1115oPks] [^116yJTuj].

> I will now examine the ulnar styloid question. With a stable DRUJ and minimal displacement, routine fixation of the ulnar styloid is not recommended. BSSH explicitly advises not to fix the ulnar styloid when the DRUJ is stable, and observational data show no adverse effect on wrist function or DRUJ stability when the styloid is left unfixed after stable radius fixation, even when displaced up to 2 mm, so I should avoid adding a styloid screw here [^111gJqD3] [^117NPAJx].

> But wait, what if the styloid base is involved and there is concern for TFCC injury? Even then, with a stable DRUJ, the balance of evidence does not support routine styloid fixation, and meta-analytic data suggest no consistent functional penalty from an associated ulnar styloid fracture when the radius is stabilized, reinforcing a conservative approach to the ulna in this case [^112C2cqQ].

> Let me synthesize the plan. The most appropriate surgical management for this 62-year-old with a reducible, extra-articular dorsally displaced distal radius fracture is closed reduction and percutaneous K-wire fixation with cast immobilization, reserving volar locking plate fixation for situations where closed reduction fails, there is marked dorsal comminution, or the patient has high functional demands and a strong preference after shared decision-making. The minimally displaced ulnar styloid fracture should be managed nonoperatively given DRUJ stability [^1158ngUh] [^11176P7n] [^111gJqD3].

> I should double-check follow-up and rehabilitation. Early mobilization is reasonable once pain allows in stable fixation, and careful radiographic follow-up is warranted in older adults and those with dorsal comminution to detect loss of reduction. I need to ensure the team plans for early finger motion and staged wrist motion to mitigate stiffness while protecting the fixation [^111GqNV6] [^116KdFEm] [^116mr4eE].

> In summary, after verifying the fracture pattern, age, and stability, the guideline-concordant choice is K-wire fixation of the distal radius with casting and nonoperative management of the minimally displaced ulnar styloid, given the stable DRUJ and the ability to achieve a closed reduction. This balances functional equivalence, lower invasiveness, and cost while aligning with BSSH and contemporary RCT evidence [^1158ngUh] [^11176P7n] [^111gJqD3].

---

For a 62-year-old woman with a dorsally displaced, extra-articular distal radius fracture and a minimally displaced ulnar styloid fracture, **BSSH recommends K-wire fixation with casting** for the distal radius when closed reduction is achievable, as it provides stable fixation with less soft-tissue disruption than plating [^1158ngUh]. The ulnar styloid should **not be fixed** because the DRUJ is stable; routine styloid fixation does not improve outcomes and may cause complications [^111gJqD3] [^117NPAJx]. If closed reduction fails or the radius fracture is unstable, volar locking plate fixation is an alternative, but the ulnar styloid should still be left unfixed unless there is persistent DRUJ instability [^113nj96r] [^111gJqD3].

---

## Indications for surgical management

According to BSSH guidelines, surgical management is indicated for distal radius fractures when:

- **Closed reduction fails**: The fracture cannot be adequately reduced or maintained by closed manipulation and casting [^notfound].
- **Instability**: The fracture is unstable, with significant dorsal angulation, radial shortening, or comminution [^1152Xru4].
- **Functional demands**: The patient has high functional demands or pre-injury activity levels that necessitate stable fixation [^1173Bbm6].

In this case, the fracture is dorsally displaced and extra-articular, and closed reduction is achievable; therefore, **surgical fixation is reasonable** to maintain alignment and allow early mobilization [^1158ngUh].

---

## Recommended surgical technique: K-wire fixation with casting

BSSH specifically recommends **K-wire fixation with casting** for dorsally displaced distal radius fractures that can be reduced closed. This technique involves:

- **Closed reduction**: Manipulation of the fracture to restore anatomical alignment.
- **Percutaneous K-wire fixation**: Insertion of K-wires through the skin to stabilize the fracture fragments.
- **Cast immobilization**: Application of a cast to maintain reduction and protect the fixation.

K-wire fixation is favored in this scenario because it is **minimally invasive**, preserves soft tissues, and provides sufficient stability for extra-articular fractures. It also allows for early mobilization once the fracture has healed sufficiently [^1158ngUh].

---

## Management of the ulnar styloid fracture

The ulnar styloid fracture in this case is minimally displaced and the DRUJ is stable. BSSH guidelines explicitly state that **routine fixation of the ulnar styloid is not necessary** when the DRUJ is stable [^111gJqD3]. The rationale includes:

- **No functional benefit**: Fixing the ulnar styloid does not improve wrist function or DRUJ stability when the DRUJ is already stable [^117NPAJx].
- **Potential complications**: Fixation of the ulnar styloid can lead to hardware irritation, nonunion, and additional surgical morbidity [^115tx3hp].
- **Spontaneous healing**: Minimally displaced ulnar styloid fractures typically heal without intervention, especially when the DRUJ is stable [^notfound].

Therefore, the ulnar styloid fracture should be managed **conservatively** with immobilization in the cast, without surgical fixation [^111gJqD3].

---

## Alternative surgical option: volar locking plate fixation

If K-wire fixation is not feasible or if the fracture is deemed unstable, **volar locking plate fixation** is an alternative surgical option. This technique involves open reduction and internal fixation with a volar locking plate, providing rigid fixation and allowing early wrist motion. However, it is more invasive than K-wire fixation and carries risks such as hardware irritation, tendon injury, and higher cost [^114dJd5U] [^111TaAeS].

---

## Postoperative management and rehabilitation

Postoperative management following K-wire fixation includes:

- **Immobilization**: The wrist is immobilized in a cast for approximately 4–6 weeks, depending on fracture healing.
- **Early mobilization**: Once the cast is removed, early wrist and hand exercises are initiated to restore range of motion and strength [^111GqNV6].
- **Follow-up**: Regular clinical and radiographic follow-up is essential to monitor fracture healing and detect any loss of reduction [^112QvreW].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Fracture type** | **Recommended surgical management** | **Ulnar styloid management** |
|-|-|-|
| Dorsally displaced, extra-articular distal radius fracture | K-wire fixation with casting | Conservative management (no fixation) |
| Alternative if K-wire fixation not feasible | Volar locking plate fixation | Conservative management (no fixation) |

---

For a 62-year-old woman with a dorsally displaced, extra-articular distal radius fracture and a minimally displaced ulnar styloid fracture, **BSSH recommends K-wire fixation with casting** for the distal radius and conservative management of the ulnar styloid, given the stable DRUJ. This approach balances effective fixation, minimal invasiveness, and optimal functional outcomes.

### Operative vs nonoperative treatment of distal radius fractures in adults… [^117UvA8i]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

Results are reported using inverse-variance weighted random-effects methods. RCT indicates randomized clinical trial; RR, risk raio. Size of diamond markers indicates weight. Data are expressed as medium-term Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire score according to mean age of the study population in a meta-analysis of distal radius fractures. Circles represent the different studies, with circle size corresponding to the study weight. The black line represents the null value. MD indicates mean difference. Question What outcomes are associated with operative vs nonoperative treatment of distal radius fractures in adults.

Findings This meta-analysis of 2254 unique participants in 23 unique studies showed that operative treatment of distal radius fractures improved the medium-term Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire score and grip strength compared with nonoperative treatment in adults, with no difference in overall complication rate. Meaning These findings suggest that operative treatment might be preferred for distal radius fractures. Importance No consensus has been reached to date regarding the optimal treatment for distal radius fractures. The international rate of operative treatment has been increasing, despite higher costs and limited functional outcome evidence to support this shift. Objectives To compare functional, clinical, and radiologic outcomes after operative vs nonoperative treatment of distal radius fractures in adults.

Study Selection Randomized clinical trials and observational studies reporting on the following: acute distal radius fracture with operative treatment vs nonoperative treatment; patients 18 years or older; and functional outcome. Studies in a language other than English or reporting treatment for refracture were excluded. Conclusions and Relevance This meta-analysis suggests that operative treatment of distal radius fractures improves the medium-term DASH score and grip strength compared with nonoperative treatment in adults, with no difference in overall complication rate. The findings suggest that operative treatment might be more effective and have a greater effect on the health and well-being of younger, nonelderly patients. The management of distal radius fractures consists of operative or nonoperative treatment. However, no consensus has been reached regarding the optimal treatment method.

Several meta-analyses have been published on the comparison between operative and nonoperative treatment. 3–5 Recent meta-analyses have focused specifically on patient populations 60 years or older. 4, 5 These meta-analyses found no difference in functional outcome between operative and nonoperative treatment in elderly patients. However, the international rate of operative treatment of distal radius fractures has been increasing, despite higher cost and limited functional outcome evidence to support this shift.
6. The primary aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to compare functional, clinical, and radiologic outcomes after operative vs nonoperative treatment of distal radius fractures in adults. As a secondary aim, we sought to compare outcomes in studies that only included patients 60 years or older and other studies that included patients 18 years or older. Finally, we compared effect estimates from RCTs and observational studies.

### What is the relative effectiveness of the various surgical treatment options for distal radius fractures? A systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1157hu5o]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Many acceptable treatment options exist for distal radius fractures (DRFs); however, a simultaneous comparison of all methods is difficult using conventional study designs.

Questions/Purposes

We performed a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on DRF treatment to answer the following questions: Compared with nonoperative treatment, (1) which intervention is associated with the best 1-year functional outcome? (2) Which intervention is associated with the lowest risk of overall complications? (3) Which intervention is associated with the lowest risk of complications requiring operation?

Methods

Ten databases were searched from inception to July 25, 2019. Search and analysis reporting adhered to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines. Included studies were English-language RCTs that assessed at least one surgical treatment arm for adult patients with displaced DRFs, with less than 20% loss to follow-up. We excluded RCTs reporting on patients with open fractures, extensive bone loss, or ipsilateral upper extremity polytrauma. Seventy RCTs (n = 4789 patients) were included. Treatments compared were the volar locking plate, bridging external fixation, nonbridging external fixation, dynamic external fixation, percutaneous pinning, intramedullary fixation, dorsal plating, fragment-specific plating, and nonoperative treatment. Subgroup analyses were conducted for intraarticular fractures, extraarticular fractures, and patients with an average age greater than 60 years. Mean (range) patient age was 59 years (56 to 63) and was similar across all treatment groups except for dynamic external fixation (44 years) and fragment-specific plating (47 years). Distribution of intraarticular and extraarticular fractures was approximately equal among the treatment groups other than that for intramedullary fixation (73% extraarticular), fragment-specific plating (66% intraarticular) [13, 70], and dorsal plating (100% intraarticular). Outcomes were the DASH score at 1 year, total complications, and reoperation. The minimum clinically important different (MCID) for the DASH score was set at 10 points. The analysis was performed using Bayesian methodology with random-effects models. Rank orders were generated using surface under the cumulative ranking curve values. Evidence quality was assessed using Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. Most studies had a low risk of bias due to randomization and low rates of incomplete follow-up, unclear risk of bias due to selective reporting, and high risk of bias due to lack of patient and assessor blinding. Studies assessing bridging external fixation and/or nonoperative treatment arms had a higher overall risk of bias while studies with volar plating and/or percutaneous pinning treatment arms had a lower risk of bias.

Results

Across all patients, there were no clinically important differences in terms of the DASH score at 1 year; although differences were found, all were less than the MCID of 10 points. Volar plating was ranked the highest for DASH score at 1 year (mean difference -7.34 [95% credible interval -11 to -3.7) while intramedullary fixation, with low-quality evidence, also showed improvement in DASH score (mean difference -7.75 [95% CI -14.6 to -0.56]). The subgroup analysis revealed that only locked volar plating was favored over nonoperative treatment for patients older than 60 years of age (mean difference -6.4 [95% CI -11 to -2.1]) and for those with intraarticular fractures (mean difference -8.4 [95% CI -15 to -2.0]). However, its clinical importance was uncertain as the MCID was not met. Among all patients, intramedullary fixation (odds ratio 0.09 [95% CI 0.02 to 0.84]) and locked volar plating (OR 0.14 [95% CI 0.05 to 0.39]) were associated with a lower complication risk compared with nonoperative treatment. For intraarticular fractures, volar plating was the only treatment associated with a lower risk of complications than nonoperative treatment (OR 0.021 [95% CI < 0.01 to 0.50]). For extraarticular fractures, only nonbridging external fixation was associated with a lower risk of complications than nonoperative treatment (OR 0.011 [95% CI < 0.01 to 0.65]), although the quality of evidence was low. Among all patients, the risk of complications requiring operation was lower with intramedullary fixation (OR 0.06 [95% CI < 0.01 to 0.85) than with nonoperative treatment, but no treatment was favored over nonoperative treatment when analyzed by subgroups.

Conclusion

We found no clinically important differences favoring any surgical treatment option with respect to 1-year functional outcome. However, relative to the other options, volar plating was associated with a lower complication risk, particularly in patients with intraarticular fractures, while nonbridging external fixation was associated with a lower complication risk in patients with extraarticular fractures. For patients older than 60 years of age, nonoperative treatment may still be the preferred option because there is no reliable evidence showing a consistent decrease in complications or complications requiring operation among the other treatment options. Particularly in this age group, the decision to expose patients to even a single surgery should be made with caution.

### Distal radius fractures: current concepts [^1165v65G]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Despite the frequency of distal radius fractures, the optimal treatment remains without consensus opinion. A trend toward increased distal radius fracture open reduction and internal fixation has been identified, with biomechanical and clinical studies suggesting treatment advantages of certain fixation methods over others. Well-controlled patient trials are still missing to lend objective findings to management algorithms. This article reviews the literature over the past 5 years to guide our management regarding this common upper-extremity injury.

### Wrist fractures [^114VugJY]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

The benefits of a well-reduced and well-healed wrist fracture are predictable. This knowledge has prompted the development of myriad treatment methods and fixation devices. The choice of open versus closed reduction and the devices used to maintain that reduction could most often be determined with a well-defined and reproducible closed reduction maneuver. With this maneuver, the integrity of the critical volar ulnar corner of the radius is determined as is articular stepoff, metaphyseal comminution, and distal radionular joint (DRUJ) stability. Reconstruction of the subluxed or dislocated DRUJ starts with the reduction of the radius, frequently obviating the need to address fractures involving the ulnar head and styloid. Most importantly, the results of treatment reflect surgical decision over the fixation method.

Future research notes that "more rigid radiographic criteria (e.g. any fracture displacement not just > 2mm)" and assessment of durability "in the longer term (e.g. 10–20 years)" should be studied.

### Evaluation of risk factors for loss of acceptable alignment for distal radius fractures that are nondisplaced or minimally displaced on initial presentation [^116mr4eE]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Numerous studies have evaluated risk factors for loss of acceptable radiographic alignment, as described by the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG), following closed reduction of distal radius fractures (DRFs). Less is known about DRFs that are well aligned on initial presentation and do not require closed reduction. We evaluated the rate of and risk factors for displacement of DRFs that are nondisplaced or minimally displaced on initial presentation.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study identified patients with nondisplaced or minimally displaced DRFs seen at a single academic tertiary center between 2015 and 2019. DRFs that required a reduction or initial surgical treatment based on the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons CPG and those with a volar shear pattern were excluded. We recorded standard radiographic measurements on presentation and wrist radiographs after 6 weeks. Univariate and binary multivariable logistic regression analyses evaluated associations between sex, age, the presence of dorsal comminution, intra-articular involvement, associated ulnar fractures, and minimal displacement (vs nondisplacement on initial radiographs) with loss of acceptable alignment.

Results

Of the 110 included patients, 72% were female and the mean age was 52 years (SD, 17 years). Overall, 33 (30%) had displacement beyond the AAOS CPG criteria at 6 weeks. A multivariable analysis demonstrated that the presence of dorsal comminution (odds ratio, 37.8) and age > 60 years (odds ratio, 3.6) were significantly associated with loss of acceptable alignment, whereas sex, intra-articular involvement, associated ulnar styloid/neck fractures, and minimal displacement were not associated.

Conclusions

For DRFs that were initially nondisplaced or minimally displaced, the overall rate of unacceptable radiographic displacement at 6 weeks was 30%. Dorsal comminution and age > 60 years were both independently associated with displacement, suggesting that patients with these risk factors may warrant closer follow-up than those without risk factors.

### Intramedullary fixation of distal radius fractures [^116iUbi4]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Intramedullary fixation has recently received increased enthusiasm as an option for distal radius fracture fixation. Indications for this fracture fixation technique should be limited to predominately displaced extra-articular or simple intra-articular distal radius fractures. Intramedullary fixation permits limited soft tissue dissection and insertion of a low-profile implant that acts as an internal splint. Purported benefits include a familiar fracture fixation technique, less soft tissue irritation, and locked fixed-angle technology. Thorough understanding of the radial and dorsal approaches to the distal radius is a prerequisite. Important aspects of intramedullary fixation of distal radius fractures include proper fracture selection, good fracture reduction, protection of sensory nerves, and avoidance of inadvertent intra-articular screw placement. Relevant surgical anatomy, technique, postoperative care, and a review of complications are presented.

### Practical application of the 2020 distal radius fracture AAOS / ASSH clinical practice guideline: a clinical case [^115FvX22]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2022). Medium credibility.

The Clinical Practice Guideline Management of Distal Radius Fractures released by the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons and the American Society for Surgery of the Hand is a summary of the available evidence designed to guide surgeons and other qualified physicians in the management of distal radius fractures. According to this guideline, age of 65 is used as a proxy for functional activity and can serve as a threshold under which patients are likely to benefit from surgical fixation and over which patients are less likely to benefit from surgical fixation when compared with nonsurgical treatment. Supervised therapy and arthroscopic assistance should be used sparingly and on a case-by-case basis. Routine radiographs should also be used on a case-by-case basis. As strong evidence suggests no difference observed in clinical or radiographic outcomes by fixation technique used after 3 months, fixation technique should be driven by fracture pattern. These guidelines serve to guide physicians in the care of patients with distal radius fractures.

### Outcomes in older adults with distal radius fracture managed by casting vs surgery… [^1173Bbm6]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

DRF indicates distal radius fracture; UE, upper extremity; VLPs, volar locking plates. Question Is recovery after distal radius fracture managed with casting vs surgery different in patients stratified by physiologic vs chronologic age. Findings This secondary analysis of the Wrist and Radius Injury Surgical Trial demonstrated that older adults with high preinjury activity levels and few comorbidities had clinically significant improvement in short-term patient-reported outcomes after surgical treatment of distal radius fractures. Meaning These findings suggest that surgeons should place emphasis on a patient's baseline activity level and number of comorbidities to guide operative treatment decisions of distal radius fractures in older adults, even if these individuals have an advanced chronologic age. Importance Casting is recommended for adults older than 65 years with distal radius fractures because similar long-term outcomes are achieved regardless of treatment.

However, physiologically younger adults could benefit from operative DRF management despite advanced chronologic age. Objective To examine how chronologic age compares with measures of physiologic age in DRF treatment recovery. Design, Setting, and Participants This retrospective secondary analysis of the Wrist and Radius Injury Surgical Trial was performed from May 1 to August 31, 2022. WRIST was a 24-center randomized clinical trial that enrolled participants older than 60 years with unstable DRFs from April 1, 2012, to December 31,
2016. Interventions Participants selected casting or surgery. Patients who selected surgery were randomly assigned to volar lock plating, percutaneous pinning, or external fixation. Participants were stratified by chronologic age, number of comorbidities, and activity status. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was Michigan Hand Outcomes Questionnaire score assessed at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year.

Partial correlation analysis adjusted for confounding. Although numerous studies3, 4 have compared operative with nonoperative treatment of DRFs, no consensus has been reached regarding optimal management in the geriatric population. Evidence from randomized clinical trials suggests long-term patient-reported outcomes are comparable, regardless of treatment received or postreduction radiographic alignment. 5, 6 However, key differences among DRF treatments are evident in their short-term outcomes. Compared with other treatments, VLPs are associated with significantly better patient-reported outcomes in the early recovery period and enable faster return to mobility.
6. In 2020, the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons published appropriate use criteria for DRF management.

7–9 These guidelines provide evidence that operative management of DRFs in patients older than 65 years does not improve long-term patient-reported outcomes and suggest that casting should be the preferred treatment for DRFs in older adults. The principle of physiologic age operates under the assumption that an individual's health deteriorates at varying rates. Therefore, by aggregating factors related to health status, such as comorbidities and functional demand, we can estimate the biologic function or physiologic age of an individual. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, average life expectancy in the US has increased 2 years since 1999. 11 In addition, older adults have a longer disability-free life expectancy and are maintaining activities of daily living for longer periods.

### Dorsal locked plate fixation of distal radius fractures [^115oJ8tT]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Distal radius fractures are common, and internal fixation for operative management of these injuries is widely accepted. Although use of the volar approach for plate fixation has become more popular, benefits of the dorsal surgical approach include the potential for direct reduction and assessment of articular alignment, evaluation and management of concomitant intrinsic intercarpal ligament injury, and initiation of early range of motion. For certain fracture patterns, dorsal plate fixation is the preferred surgical technique. Improvements in implant design, in particular the use of low-profile dorsal plates, has decreased the rate of complications seen previously with this technique. Here, we provide an overview of the evaluation of patients with distal radius fractures, as well as the surgical indications and contraindications, techniques, and complications after dorsal locked plate fixation of intra-articular distal radius fractures.

### Are volar locking plates superior to percutaneous K-wires for distal radius fractures? A meta-analysis [^112cDmLY]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Distal radius fractures are common, costly, and increasing in incidence. Percutaneous K-wire fixation and volar locking plates are two of the most commonly used surgical treatments for unstable dorsally displaced distal radius fractures. However, there is uncertainty regarding which of these treatments is superior.

Questions/Purposes

We performed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to determine whether patients treated with volar locking plates (1) achieved better function (2) attained better wrist motion, (3) had better radiographic outcomes, and (4) had fewer complications develop than did patients treated with K-wires for dorsally displaced distal radius fractures.

Methods

We performed a comprehensive search of MEDLINE (inception to 2014, October Week 2), EMBASE (inception to 2014, Week 42), and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials to identify relevant randomized controlled trials; we supplemented these searches with manual searches. We included studies of extraarticular and intraarticular distal radius fractures. Adjunctive external fixation was acceptable as long as the intent was to use only K-wires where possible and external fixation was used in less than 25% of the procedures. We considered a difference in the DASH scores of 10 as the minimal clinically important difference. We performed quality assessment with the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool and evaluated the strength of recommendations using the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Seven randomized trials with a total of 875 participants were included in the meta-analysis.

Results

Patients treated with volar locking plates had slightly better function than did patients treated with K-wires as measured by their DASH scores at 3 months (mean difference [MD], 7.5; 95% CI, 4.4–10.6; p < 0.001) and 12 months (MD, 3.8; 95% CI, 1.2–6.3; p = 0.004). Neither of these differences exceeded the a priori-determined threshold for clinical importance (10 points). There was a small early advantage in flexion and supination in the volar locking plate group (3.7° [95% CI, 0.3°-7.1°; p = 0.04] and 4.1° [95% CI, 0.6°-7.6°; p = 0.02] greater, respectively) at 3 months, but not at later followups (6 or 12 months). There were no differences in radiographic outcomes (volar tilt, radial inclination, and radial height) between the two interventions. Superficial wound infection was more common in patients treated with K-wires (8.2% versus 3.2%; RR = 2.6; p = 0.001), but otherwise no difference in complication rates was found.

Conclusions

Despite the small number of studies and the limitations inherent in a meta-analysis, we found that volar locking plates show better DASH scores at 3- and 12-month followups compared with K-wires for displaced distal radius fractures in adults; however, these differences were small and unlikely to be clinically important. Further research is required to better delineate if there are specific radiographic, injury, or patient characteristics that may benefit from volar locking plates in the short term and whether there are any differences in long-term outcomes and complications.

External Fixation

Another surgical technique for geriatric DRF that is reserved for unstable and severely comminuted fractures is external fixation. External fixation is a technique that does not directly address the reduction and maintenance of the dorsal tilt and intra-articular fragments. However, the AUC assigned an appropriate criterion in high energy traumas with comminuted intra-articular DRF with radiocarpal subluxation (AUC = 7) among the elderly population. - In our study, 6.2% of the surgeons preferred to use this technique for geriatric patients with comminuted intra-articular DRF with radiocarpal subluxation (Case 3).

Associated Ulnar Styloid Fractures

The treatment of an associated ulnar styloid fracture remains controversial. Currently, the AAOS AUC has no conclusive evidence to recommend operative or non-operative treatment for the ulna styloid fracture. In 2009, Zenke et al found in 118 patients with DRF, that the presence of ulnar styloid fracture does not adversely affect the outcome in DRF treated by volar plating. In our study, none of the respondents opted to perform operative fixation of associated ulnar styloid fractures.

Defining the strength of the recommendations — judging the strength of evidence is only a steppingstone towards arriving at the strength of a systematic literature review recommendation. The strength of recommendation also takes into account the quality, quantity, and the trade-off between the benefits and harms of a treatment, the magnitude of a treatment's effect, and whether there is data on critical outcomes. The recommendations and their strength were voted on by the guideline development group members during the final meeting, and recommendations were approved and adopted in instances where a simple majority (60%) of the guideline development group voted to approve.

### Surgical fixation with K-wires versus casting in adults with fracture of distal radius: DRAFFT2 multicentre randomised clinical trial [^115u1uGh]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Study conduct and oversight

The protocol and statistical analysis plan are available online. This multicentre randomised superiority clinical trial was conducted at 36 National Health Service (NHS) hospitals in the UK. The National Research Ethics Committee gave the study a favourable opinion on 6 October 2016, and recruitment centres received permission from their research and development departments. Two minor amendments were made to the protocol to extend the duration of the trial, add digital follow-up, and allow for incentives for follow-up. A local researcher approached eligible patients prospectively and provided them with written information about the trial before asking them to provide informed consent.

Participants

All patients aged 16 years or over with a dorsally displaced fracture of the distal radius were screened. Patients were potentially eligible if their treating surgeon recommended that they needed a manipulation of their fracture. Patients were excluded if the injury was more than two weeks old, the fracture extended more than 3 cm from radiocarpal joint, the fracture was open with a Gustilo and Anderson grading greater than 1, the joint surface of the fracture could not be reduced by closed manipulation, or the patient was unable to complete follow-up questionnaires. After provision of informed consent, the local research team recorded baseline data, including pre-fracture wrist function (retrospective by recall) and current, post-fracture wrist function.

Randomisation and blinding

The randomisation sequence, prepared by the trial statistician, included block stratification by recruitment centre, articular extension of the fracture (intra-articular or extra-articular), and age of the participant (< 50 or ≥ 50 years). The treatment allocation was computer generated via a secure, centralised web based randomisation service.

Patients who provided informed consent were advised that at the time of surgery, in a minority of cases, the surgeon might be unable to manipulate the fracture into its normal anatomical alignment without making incisions in the skin to access the fracture site. Patients who needed such an "open" reduction of the articular surface of their fracture were not randomised into the trial and were treated according to their surgeons' normal clinical practice. For participants in whom a closed reduction of the fracture was possible, the surgeon completed the randomisation process after the manipulation. The participants were allocated in a 1:1 ratio to receive a moulded cast ("cast group") or surgical fixation with K-wires ("K-wire group"). Surgeons commonly use both techniques in their normal clinical practice. As the interventions were clearly visible to the participants, they could not be blind to treatment allocation.

Locking Plate

The literature has provided debatable results regarding the use of dorsal versus volar locking plate in the surgical management of DRF.- The use of volar locking plate has been reported as the preferred method for internal fixation of DRF because it provides an adequate reduction of the articular surface and reduces the risk for extensor tendon rupture compared to dorsal plating. In 2006, Ruch et al demonstrated lower rate of complications and volar collapses with the use of volar plating. On the other hand, Rein et al demonstrated no significant difference in functional or radiographical outcome after the use of dorsal versus volar locking plate in the management of DRF. Furthermore, the AUC guidelines are unable to support a preference toward dorsal or volar locking plate. In our study, the comminuted intra-articular DRF (presented in Case 3), had a higher AUC number rating for volar plating (AUC = 9) than the use of dorsal plating (AUC = 7) in the geriatric patient. Overall, our respondents preferred the use of volar plating in the management of extra-articular (Case 1) and complete-articular fractures (Case 3 and Case 4). The management of partial-articular fractures (Case 2 and Case 5) were the only scenarios where the majority of respondents preferred the use of fragment fixation.

Fragment-Specific Fixation

Fragment-specific fixation is a valuable DRF surgical technique that is suitable for certain fracture patterns when locking plate techniques are not sufficient. Fractures such as radial styloid, impacted intraarticular fragments, among others, can be secured with specific implants designed for each individual fragment. These techniques can be used independently or in combination with other fixation techniques to obtain accurate reductions and favorable functional outcomes. In our study, we found that the majority of respondents opted to manage displaced radial styloid fractures and intra-articular DRF with. The use of was considered an appropriate (AUC 7–9) recommendation in all of the clinical scenarios presented in our study.

### Cannulated self-drilling, self-tapping pins for displaced extra-articular distal radius fractures [^111vhUg8]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Displaced unstable extra-articular radius fractures are common and frequently treated with open reduction and internal fixation with a fixed-angle volar plate. Although this treatment yields good results, it might be more invasive than necessary for management of this often relatively simple fracture. In this article, we present the technique of using a cannulated self-drilling, self-tapping (CSDT) construct that can be employed in a minimally invasive fashion. The CSDT offers a minimally invasive alternative to volar fixed-angle plating for unstable extra-articular distal radius fractures. It also can be useful in isolated displaced radial styloid fractures. Placed appropriately, implants rarely have to be removed. The CSDT also allows for early motion and rapid return to activities with anticipated satisfactory range of motion and function.

### Surgical fixation with K-wires versus casting in adults with fracture of distal radius: DRAFFT2 multicentre randomised clinical trial [^113nj96r]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Comparison with previous studies

We chose K-wire fixation as the surgical intervention comparator, as previous research indicates that K-wire fixation provides similar outcomes to the alternative plate and screw fixation for those patients in whom a closed reduction of the fracture can be achieved, with plates being reserved for fractures requiring an open reduction of the articular surface of the fracture. The use of wires reflects current UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines for the management of distal radius fractures. After the DRAFFT2 trial started, Karantana et al published a Cochrane review of wire fixation for adult patients with a dorsally displaced fracture of the distal radius. This review included a total of 11 randomised or quasi-randomised trials of manipulation and plaster cast versus manipulation and K-wire fixation, involving 917 participants nearly all of whom were older adults. The authors concluded that the quality of the existing evidence was very low. All of the trials included in the review were found to be at high risk of bias, with incomplete reporting meaning that the authors were unable to draw a conclusion about the effect of the interventions on patient reported function. They did report that the risk of re-displacement of the fracture in the participants treated with manipulation and cast was very similar to that found in DRAFFT2, with an average of 12% (range 3–75%). We updated this evidence synthesis in July 2020 with a search of the NIH National Library of Medicine via PubMed.gov and did not find any other trials that attempted to answer this question.

The literature to guide clinical-decision making for the treatment of symptomatic distal radioulnar joint instability in the setting of distal radius fracture is mixed, with some advocating for surgical treatment at the time of fracture fixation and others reporting acceptable clinical outcomes with conservative management. Given this, it can be challenging to determine which treatment strategy to employ for each individual patient. For injuries that are the result of high-energy trauma or when there is persistent instability lasting 6 months or longer after fracture fixation, surgical intervention may be needed. However, a period of conservative treatment does not appear to result in poorer outcomes.

### Should an ulnar styloid fracture be fixed following volar plate fixation of a distal radial fracture? [^117NPAJx]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Ulnar styloid fractures often occur in association with distal radial fractures. The purpose of this study was to determine whether an associated ulnar styloid fracture following stable fixation of a distal radial fracture has any effect on wrist function or on the development of chronic distal radioulnar joint instability.

Methods

One hundred and thirty-eight consecutive patients who underwent surgical treatment of an unstable distal radial fracture were included in this study. During surgery, none of the accompanying ulnar styloid fractures were internally fixed. Patients were divided into nonfracture, nonbase fracture, and base fracture groups, on the basis of the location of the ulnar styloid fracture, and into nonfracture, minimally displaced (≤ 2 mm), and considerably displaced (> 2 mm) groups, according to the amount of ulnar styloid fracture displacement at the time of injury. Postoperative evaluation included measurement of grip strength and wrist range of motion; calculation of the modified Mayo wrist score and Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand score; as well as testing for instability of the distal radioulnar joint at a mean of nineteen months postoperatively.

Results

Ulnar styloid fractures were present in seventy-six (55%) of the 138 patients. Forty-seven (62%) involved the nonbase portion of the ulnar styloid and twenty-nine (38%) involved the base of the ulnar styloid. Thirty-four (45%) were minimally displaced, and forty-two (55%) were considerably (> 2 mm) displaced. We did not find a significant relationship between wrist functional outcomes and ulnar styloid fracture level or the amount of displacement. Chronic instability of the distal radioulnar joint occurred in two wrists (1.4%).

Conclusions

An accompanying ulnar styloid fracture in patients with stable fixation of a distal radial fracture has no apparent adverse effect on wrist function or stability of the distal radioulnar joint.

### Association between radiographic and clinical outcomes following distal radial fractures: a prospective cohort study with 1-year follow-up in 366 patients [^1118SBXW]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2023). Medium credibility.

Distal radial fracture is the most common fracture in adults. According to guidelines from several different countries, treatment is mainly dependent on fracture displacement and functional demands -. Such guidelines use dorsal tilt, ulnar variance, radial inclination, and intra-articular step-off as the important radiographic parameters. Several studies have investigated the degree of final displacement and its association with clinical outcomes -. There is still no consensus on the importance of radiographic outcomes, and published studies have not used the same criteria for acceptable alignment. Previous studies have used linear or dichotomized analyses.

For displaced distal radial fractures, the restoration of alignment is important for good clinical outcomes. However, there is no consensus on which radiographic parameter is the best predictor. Dorsal tilt and ulnar variance are often thought to be the most important radiographic parameters.

The evidence is inconclusive regarding when surgical treatment is indicated. Despite the lack of evidence, there is a recent trend toward more surgical interventions.

The purpose of the present study was to investigate the relationship between radiographic and clinical outcomes following distal radial fractures. Specifically, we investigated (1) whether there is a nonlinear relationship between the degree of final displacement and clinical outcome and (2) whether there is a cutoff value for clinical outcome (i.e. a radiographic measurement threshold beyond which clinical outcome becomes progressively worse).

### Comparison of three fixation techniques for displaced distal… [^116uHwty]. ClinicalTrials (2008). Low credibility.

Comparison of Three Fixation Techniques for Displaced Distal Radius Fractures ClinicalTrials. gov ID.
- Primary Outcome Variable: Validated functional outcome tools to be used: patient rated wrist evaluation disability shoulder, arm, hand short musculoskeletal functional assessment
- Secondary Outcome Measures: Clinical outcome: measurement of range of motion, strength, and dexterity. Radiologic outcome: X-ray parameters. Distal radius fractures are the most common fracture to occur in the adult population, and those which are displaced but maintain joint congruity are the most common subtype.

Locking-plate technology represents a true advance in the fixation of these fractures, especially in view of the ever increasing incidence of these injuries in an ageing and osteoporotic population throughout Europe and North America. These plates permit rigid fixation, even in osteopenic bone, while avoiding any tethering of soft tissues, as seen with external fixation and percutaneous pinning. For these reasons, this mode of fracture fixation has rapidly gained popularity. Unfortunately, there is presently little evidence to support their use over the more traditional methods of fixation. In addition, the technique for their application is more invasive and their cost is considerably greater than these latter two techniques. As such, it is pertinent to evaluate, in a scientifically sound fashion, the outcome of fixation with the three types of implant included in this study.

The results of this clinical trial will allow the orthopaedic community to confidently recommend the fixation method which provides the optimal functional, clinical, and radiographic outcome for a patient suffering a displaced distal radius with preserved joint congruity. Null hypothesis: There is no difference in the functional, clinical, and radiographic outcomes of the three treatment methods. Hypothesis: Given the locking nature of modern screw-plate constructs, which produce excellent fixation even in osteopenic bone and permit early range of motion exercises; and given that plate fixation, in contrast to external fixation and percutaneous pinning, does not tether muscle, tendon, or capsule; plate fixation with a volar fixed-angle device should permit earlier and more aggressive rehabilitation and more rapid and complete regain of hand and wrist function when compared to stabilization with external fixation or percutaneous pinning. Detailed Description.

Fractures of the distal radius, the most common fracture to occur in adults, are increasing in incidence and cost due to ageing of the population and the link with senile osteoporosis. Young adults also suffer these injuries albeit involving higher-energy mechanisms. Closed reduction and casting is often unsuccessful in maintaining adequate alignment and length, both of which are crucial to a successful outcome. Thus, there has been a trend toward surgical treatment of these fractures. In fractures with preserved joint congruity, 3 fixation options exist: percutaneous pinning, non-spanning external fixation, and locked-plates. Locked-plates represent a significant advance in the fixation of fractures, especially in osteopenic bone, although their role in distal radius fractures has yet to be defined adequately.

### Should ulnar styloid be fixed following fixation of a distal radius fracture? [^115tx3hp]. Injury (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Fracture of the base of the ulnar styloid has shown to have higher incidence of TFCC tears and DRUJ instability leading to nonunion and impaired function. Poorer functional outcomes of the distal radius fracture have been attributed to the untreated associated ulnar styloid fractures while some studies have shown no difference. Thus, the treatment remains controversial. However, it has been shown that fractures at the base of the ulnar styloid have a higher incidence of tears in the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) and instability in the distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ), which can lead to nonunion and impaired function. Despite this, there are currently no studies comparing the outcomes of surgically and conservatively treated patients.

Methods

A retrospective study was conducted to analyze the outcomes of intra-articular distal radius fractures associated with base of ulnar fracture treated with distal radius LCP fixation. The study included 14 patients who were treated surgically and 49 patients who were treated conservatively, with a minimum follow-up of 2 years. Radiological parameters such as union and amount of displacement, VAS score for ulnar-sided wrist pain, functional assessment using the modified Mayo score and the quick DASH questionnaire and complications were analyzed.

Results

At the final follow-up, the mean scores for pain (VAS), functional outcomes (modified Mayo score), disability (QuickDASH score), range of motion, and non-union rate were found to be statistically insignificant (p > 0.05) between the surgically treated and conservatively treated groups. However, patients with non-union had statistically significant higher scores for pain (VAS), greater post-operative displacement of the styloid, poorer functional outcomes, and higher disability (p < 0.05).

Conclusion

While there was no significant difference in ulnar-sided wrist pain and functional outcomes between the surgically treated and conservatively treated groups, the conservatively treated cases had a higher risk of non-union, which can negatively impact functional outcomes. The amount of pre-operative displacement was found to be a key factor in predicting non-union and can be used as a guide for determining the management of this type of fracture.

The optimal management of displaced dorsal radius fractures (DRFs) in older patients remains an issue of debate. Bridging external fixation is a well-accepted treatment modality for severely comminuted DRFs, while open reduction and internal fixation with locked volar plating has emerged as a promising alternative in recent years. The current body of randomized trials supports the trend toward locked volar plating, as it allows for quicker improvement in subjective and functional outcomes. There is no clear evidence to suggest that one technique carries significantly less complications than the other. Locked volar plating should be considered in patients for whom an accelerated functional recovery would be advantageous. Otherwise, both external fixation and locked volar plating provide good long-term clinical outcomes.

### Radiological outcomes of distal radius extra-articular fragility fractures treated with extra-focal kirschner wires [^113EJSDM]. Injury (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

The classical colles fracture (extra-articular, dorsally angulated distal radius fracture) in patients with osteoporotic bone is becoming increasingly more frequent. There still appears to be no clear consensus on the most appropriate surgical management of these injuries. The purpose of this study is to appraise the use of percutaneous extra-focal pinning, in the management of the classical colles fracture.

Methods

We retrospectively analysed 72 consecutive cases of colles fractures treated with inter-fragmentary k-wire fixation, in female patients over 60 years of age, in two orthopaedic centres, under the care of 12 different orthopaedic surgeons. We correlated the radiographical distal radius measurements (ulnar variance, volar tilt, and radial inclination) at the pre-operative and intra-operative stages with the final radiographical outcome.

Result

Mean dorsal angulation was 21 degrees at time of presentation. Closed reduction significantly improved fracture position to a mean of 2.7 degrees volar angulation (p < 0.05). Mean angulation at time of k-wire removal was 1.6 degrees dorsal, this was not significant in comparison to post-reduction measurements (p < 0.05). Mean ulnar variance at time of presentation was 2.5mm (range 7.4 to -4.2). Reduction improved fracture displacement to a mean of 0mm, which was statistically significant (p < 0.05). Mean ulnar variance at time of k-wire removal was 2.4mm (p < 0.05). 56.8% of cases demonstrated radial shortening of 2mm or more.

Conclusion

In female patients over 60 years of age, the best predictor of radial length, when k-wire fixation is to be used, is the radial length prior to fracture reduction. Thus if there is radial shortening visible in the initial radiographs as measured in terms of ulnar variance, one should consider a method of fixation other than inter-fragmentary k-wires.

Risks and harms of implementation — distal radius fracture fixation: There are no known harms associated with implementing this recommendation beyond those attributed to an open surgery and placing a volar plate (e.g. symptomatic hardware or tendon rupture). The current literature suggests that function recovers earlier in patients treated with volar locked plating than with other methods, but outcomes equalize before a year from injury, and further randomized controlled trials should address long term complication profiles and cost differences; studies that use fracture type to group patients may lead to more actionable results.

### Plating of the distal radius [^114dJd5U]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2005). Low credibility.

Distal radius fractures are common injuries that can be treated by a variety of methods. Restoration of the distal radius anatomy within established guidelines yields the best short- and long-term results. Guidelines for acceptable reduction are (1) radial shortening < 5 mm, (2) radial inclination > 15 degrees, (3) sagittal tilt on lateral projection between 15 degrees dorsal tilt and 20 degrees volar tilt, (4) intra-articular step-off < 2 mm of the radiocarpal joint, and (5) articular incongruity < 2 mm of the sigmoid notch of the distal radius. Treatment options range from closed reduction and immobilization to open reduction with plates and screws; options are differentiated based on their ability to reinforce and stabilize the three columns of the distal radius and ulna. Plating allows direct restoration of the anatomy, stable internal fixation, a decreased period of immobilization, and early return of wrist function. Buttress plates reduce and stabilize vertical shear intra-articular fractures through an antiglide effect, where-as conventional and locking plates address metaphyseal comminution and/or preserve articular congruity/reduction. With conventional and locking plates, intra-articular fractures are directly reduced; with buttress plates, the plate itself helps reduce the intra-articular fracture. Complications associated with plating include tendon irritation or rupture and the need for plate removal.

### Intramedullary nail versus volar plate fixation of extra-articular distal radius fractures. two year results of a prospective randomized trial [^116c4iha]. Injury (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Intramedullary techniques for stabilization of displaced distal radius fractures are now available. Purported benefits include limited soft tissue dissection while affording sufficient stability to allow early wrist motion. The primary null hypothesis of this randomized trial is that there is no significant difference with respect to functional outcome, pain and disability between patients treated with either 2.4-mm volar locking plate fixation or intramedullary nail fixation of unstable dorsally displaced extra-articular fractures of the distal radius.

Methods

We conducted a single-centre, parallel-group trial, with unrestricted randomization. Patients with dorsally displaced extra-articular distal radius fractures were randomized to receive volar locking plate (n = 72) fixation or intramedullary nailing (n = 80). The outcome was measured on the basis of the Gartland and Werley and Castaing score; the pain level; the range of wrist motion; the rate of complications; and radiographic measurements including volar tilt and ulnar variance. Clinical and radiographic assessment was performed at 8 weeks, 6 months, 1 year and 2 years after the operation.

Results

There were no significant differences between groups in terms of range of motion, grip strength or the level of pain during the entire follow-up period (p > 0.05). There was no significant difference between treatment groups with respect to volar tilt or ulnar variance (p > 0.05). There was no significant difference in the complication rate between groups (p > 0.05).

Conclusions

The present study supports the view that intramedullary nail fixation and volar plate fixation for the treatment of displaced extra-articular distal radius fractures have equivalent radiographic and functional outcomes.

### Comparison of 24-month outcomes after treatment for distal radius fracture: the WRIST randomized clinical trial [^112dUz3j]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Methods

The WRIST protocol (Supplement 1) was approved by the institutional review board at the coordinating center and at all sites. A Data Safety and Monitoring Board appointed by the National Institutes of Health oversaw the study aims and conduct. Participants provided written informed consent. This study adheres to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials reporting guideline.

Patients with DRF who were aged 60 years or older and community-dwelling were screened for eligibility at 24 health systems located in Canada, Singapore, and the US from April 1, 2012, through December 31, 2016. Participants in the surgical (randomized) and casting (observational) groups had identical eligibility criteria: isolated fractures (concomitant ulnar styloid fracture was allowed) with displacement warranting surgical intervention (Arbeitsgemeinschaft für Osteosynthesefragen type A2, A3, C1, or C2 and meeting 1 of the following radiographic criteria after reduction: dorsal angulation > 10°, radial inclination < 15°, or radial shortening > 3 mm). All fractures were amenable to treatment with all 3 surgical treatments. Patients with open fractures, bilateral fractures, prior DRF to the same wrist, or additional serious trauma were ineligible. We excluded patients with neurological conditions affecting upper extremity sensation or movement, comorbid conditions prohibiting surgery, serious neurological or psychiatric conditions precluding informed consent, and inability to complete study questionnaires and follow directions in English (or Chinese in Singapore).

Participants who opted for surgery were randomized to undergo VLPS, EFP, or CRPP. Randomization was stratified by site and was performed online. The treating surgeon had discretion regarding implant or fixator brand and the use of tourniquet, deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis, or prophylactic antibiotics. Recognizing that there will always be patients who prefer nonsurgical management, we created an observation group to include patients who met all the inclusion and exclusion criteria but did not want to undergo surgery. Observation group participants also provided written informed consent. The fractures of these participants were managed with casting. An initial short, arm fiberglass cast was replaced with a thermoplastic splint after a month. Follow-up care and hand therapy use for both surgical and casting participants were per institutional standard.

### Fractures of the distal radius: postmanagement radiographic characterization [^111vo471]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this article is to describe the management options available for the treatment of the distal radius fracture as well as potential associated complications.

Conclusion

There are a wide variety of currently accepted and used treatment options for fractures of the distal radius, ranging from closed reduction with casting to various forms of invasive surgical management. The radiologist must be familiar with these various forms of management to recognize complications when present on follow-up radiographs.

### Volar plate fixation versus plaster immobilization in acceptably reduced extra-articular distal radial fractures: a multicenter randomized controlled trial [^112pCG78]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

There is no consensus as to whether displaced extra-articular distal radial fractures should be treated operatively or nonoperatively. We compared the outcomes of open reduction and volar plate fixation with closed reduction and plaster immobilization in adults with an acceptably reduced extra-articular distal radial fracture.

Methods

In this multicenter randomized controlled trial, patients 18 to 75 years old with an acceptably reduced extra-articular distal radial fracture were randomly assigned to open reduction and volar plate fixation or plaster immobilization. The primary outcome was function as measured with the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire after 12 months. Follow-up was conducted at 1, 3, and 6 weeks and at 3, 6, and 12 months. Analyses were performed according to the intention-to-treat principle.

Results

Ninety-two patients were randomized, 48 to open reduction and volar plate fixation and 44 to plaster immobilization; 1 patient in each group was excluded for withdrawing informed consent. At all follow-up time points, operatively treated patients had significantly better functional outcomes, as indicated by significantly lower DASH scores, than patients treated nonoperatively (all p values < 0.05). Twelve nonoperatively managed patients (28%) had fracture redisplacement within 6 weeks and underwent subsequent open reduction and internal fixation, and 6 patients (14%) had a symptomatic malunion treated with corrective osteotomy.

Conclusions

Patients with an acceptably reduced extra-articular distal radial fracture treated with open reduction and volar plate fixation have better functional outcomes after 12 months compared with nonoperatively managed patients. Additionally, 42% of nonoperatively managed patients had a subsequent surgical procedure. Open reduction and volar plate fixation should be considered for patients who experience this common injury.

### Distal radius fractures: current concepts [^111bk1je]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Despite the frequency of distal radius fractures, studies in the existing literature have not been able to determine the optimal surgical strategies for various fracture patterns. Numerous clinical articles have been written, but most are level IV case series or expert opinion reviews. Good biomechanics studies have been published that suggest advantages of certain fixation methods over others. Transference of these expectations to clinical reality, however, requires well-controlled patient trials. In large part, this has not happened. This article reviews the theoretical pros and cons of different surgical strategies used for adult distal radius fractures, and then looks at randomized controlled trials that have been published in the last 5 years.

### Does concomitant ulnar styloid fracture and distal radius fracture portend poorer outcomes? A meta-analysis of comparative studies [^112C2cqQ]. Injury (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

An ulnar styloid fracture often occur in association with a distal radial fracture. Whether an ulnar styloid fracture interfere with the results of a distal radial fracture still remains controversial. The aim of this study was to analyse the effects of an accompanying ulnar styloid fracture on clinical outcomes in patients with distal radial fractures.

Methods

A meta-analysis of published studies comparing outcomes of distal radial fractures with an ulnar styloid fracture versus isolated distal radial fractures was performed. Outcomes of function results, radiological evaluation, and patient reported scores were analyzed.

Results

Ten studies including 1403 distal radius fractures were identified fitting inclusion criteria. There was no significant difference in wrist motion, grip strength, radial height, volar angle, ulnar variance, pain score, PRWE score, or SF-36 score for distal radial fractures associated with an ulnar styloid fracture versus isolated distal radial fractures. In final follow up, patients with associated an ulnar styloid fracture had lower radial inclination and higher DASH scores. But there was no significant clinical difference. In addition, we found there was no significant difference of outcomes between union and non-union ulnar styloid fractures.

Conclusions

Based on this meta-analysis, we suggest that an associated ulnar styloid fracture does not affect the outcomes of a distal radial fracture and clinicians should be caution in electing operative treatment for patients with an ulnar styloid fracture.

Fixation technique — distal radius fractures: Strong evidence suggests no significant difference in radiographic or patient reported outcomes between fixation techniques for complete articular or unstable distal radius fractures, although volar locking plates lead to earlier recovery of function in the short term (3 months). Strength of Recommendation: Strong. Description notes evidence from two or more high-quality studies. The guideline is based upon 6 high quality studies; early in recovery the 2 studies that compared volar locked plating showed more rapid functional recovery, but at longer term follow up there were no significant differences in radiographic or patient reported outcomes, and among studies with results at 12 months or longer there was no difference in patient reported outcomes at final follow-up.

### Limited incision open techniques for distal radius fracture management [^111nt6sq]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

This article discusses recent innovations in the management of distal radius fractures. Clinical and biomechanical studies have shown that stable fixation can be achieved with small implants aligned in an orthogonal fashion. This technique greatly diminishes the necessary soft tissue dissection needed at surgery and allows for early mobilization of the wrist, which may lead to improved outcomes and fewer soft tissue complications.

Conclusions

In conclusion, and in contrast to both the trend in surgical practice and the findings of previous studies, we found no difference in patient rated wrist evaluation in the 12 months after Kirschner wire fixation versus volar locking plate fixation. Kirschner wire fixation is cheaper and quicker to perform.

### Optimal positioning for volar plate fixation of a distal radius fracture: determining the distal dorsal cortical distance [^116b5cGX]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Distal radius fractures are currently among the most common fractures of the musculoskeletal system. With a population that is living longer, being more active, and the increasing incidence of osteoporosis, these injuries will continue to become increasingly prevalent. When operative fixation is indicated, the volar locking plate has recently become the treatment of choice. However, despite its success, suboptimal position of the volar locking plate can still result in radiographic loss of reduction. The distal dorsal cortical distance is being introduced as an intraoperative radiographic tool to help optimize plate position and minimize late loss of fracture reduction.

### Distal radius fractures: approaches, indications, and techniques [^1133nVmo]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Distal radius fractures remain among the most common fractures of the upper extremity. The indications for operative management continue to evolve based on outcomes from the most recent clinical studies. Advancements over the past decade have expanded the variety of fixation options available; however, the clinical superiority of a particular treatment modality remains without consensus. Each approach requires the use of unique surgical techniques, and the choice of a particular implant system should be based on the surgeon's familiarity with the implant design and its limitations. As our understanding of the management of distal radius fractures improves, so will our indications for each specific treatment modality.

### Partial articular fracture of the distal radius treated via dorsal approach [^111c2LNT]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2022). Medium credibility.

Summary

The case of a 60-year-old woman with an impacted, dorsally unstable, displaced intra-articular distal radius fracture with dorsal sheer treated via a dorsal approach. Literature comparing dorsal to volar plating of the distal radius is mixed. Dorsal plating may lead to a greater incidence of implant removal, although radiographic and clinical outcomes seem to be similar. The rates of these complications have reduced over time with the introduction of lower profile locking plates. At 1-year after surgery, the patient demonstrated excellent clinical results with near full and painless range of motion of the wrist. She had full range of motion of thumb and fingers. The dorsal approach to the distal radius offers reliable restoration of functional ability with a low rate of neuropathic complications.

### Proximal radius fractures in children [^1142hiSi]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2019). Medium credibility.

Fractures of the proximal radius represent 5% to 10% of all elbow fractures in children. These fractures have many treatment options and have a high risk of complication, particularly loss of forearm rotation. Nonsurgical management of minimally displaced radial neck fractures produces excellent results in most patients. For displaced fractures, numerous methods of closed and percutaneous reduction have been proposed, whereas open reduction has been associated with particularly poor outcome. Many additional factors, including fracture angulation, patient age, associated injury, articular involvement, and internal fixation, may lead to worse outcomes. Because the literature is limited to retrospective case series, few studies provide high-level evidence to guide the treatment of pediatric proximal radius fractures; however, certain management principles have been established that are reviewed here.

### Ulnar styloid fractures associated with distal radius fractures: incidence and implications for distal radioulnar joint instability [^111usPFW]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Ulnar-sided injuries of the wrist have received more attention recently for their potential negative impact on the outcome of distal radius fractures. Radiographs and medical records were retrospectively reviewed for 166 distal radius fractures treated during a 1-year interval. Distal radius fractures were classified according to the AO system, and accompanying ulnar styloid fractures were evaluated for both size and displacement. Each distal radius fracture was also evaluated for radiographic and clinical evidence of distal radioulnar joint instability. The distribution of ulnar styloid fractures was not random; greater than one third involved the base. All distal radius fractures complicated by distal radioulnar joint instability were accompanied by an ulnar styloid fracture. A fracture at the ulnar styloid's base and significant displacement of an ulnar styloid fracture were found to increase the risk of distal radioulnar joint instability.

### Short term outcomes following open reduction internal fixation surgery for a distal radius fracture: 2 week versus 4 week immobilization. A retrospective analysis [^1162uDpe]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Distal radius fractures (DRF) occur frequently, predominantly in those aged over 50; incurring a large cost to medical systems. A proportion of DRF will require surgical fixation to achieve fracture stability and improve functional outcome. An open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) with a volar locking plate (VLP) is currently the most common surgical procedure for a DRF with dorsal displacement. In this specific patient population studies have shown comparable range of motion (ROM) and grip strength (GS) outcomes at 3 and 6 months post-surgery; regardless of the specific time they begin to mobilize. Limited studies have investigated therapy time, use of therapy resources or lost time from work in the short term. These are also important aspects for the quality of life of the patient and a paying health provider.

Distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint dislocation — management requires closed reduction and specific immobilization positioning: "Dislocation of the DIP joint requires reduction and splinting in full extension (for volar [palmar] dislocations) or 15 to 30 degrees of flexion (for dorsal dislocations) for 2 to 3 weeks". The presence of an open wound "necessitates surgical management with appropriate washout to prevent infection". After reduction, "periodic reevaluation is essential to assess joint stability and manage potential complications such as recurrent dislocation or joint stiffness", and "physical therapy and hand rehabilitation exercises should be initiated early to restore range of motion and strength".

### Percutaneous fixation with kirschner wires versus volar locking plate fixation in adults with dorsally displaced fracture of distal radius: randomised controlled trial [^11176P7n]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Objectives

To compare the clinical effectiveness of Kirschner wire fixation with locking plate fixation for patients with a dorsally displaced fracture of the distal radius.

Design

A multicentre two arm parallel group assessor blind randomised controlled trial with 1:1 treatment allocation.

Setting

18 trauma centres in the United Kingdom.

Participants

461 adults with a dorsally displaced fracture of the distal radius within 3 cm of the radiocarpal joint that required surgical fixation. Patients were excluded if the surgeon thought that the surface of the wrist joint was so badly displaced it required open reduction.

Interventions

Kirschner wire fixation: wires are passed through the skin over the dorsal aspect of the distal radius and into the bone to hold the fracture in the correct anatomical position. Locking plate fixation: a locking plate is applied through an incision over the volar (palm) aspect of the wrist and secured to the bone with fixed angle locking screws.

Primary Outcome Measure

validated patient rated wrist evaluation (PRWE). This rates wrist function in two (equally weighted) sections concerning the patient's experience of pain and disability to give a score out of 100.

Secondary Outcomes

disabilities of arm, shoulder, and hand (DASH) score, the EuroQol (EQ-5D), and complications related to the surgery.

Results

The baseline characteristics of the two groups were well balanced, and over 90% of patients completed follow-up. The wrist function of both groups of patients improved by 12 months. There was no clinically relevant difference in the patient rated wrist score at three, six, or 12 months (difference in favour of the plate group was -1.3, 95% confidence interval -4.5 to 1.8; P = 0.40). Nor was there a clinically relevant difference in health related quality of life or the number of complications in each group.

Conclusions

Contrary to the existing literature, and against the rapidly increasing use of locking plate fixation, this trial found no difference in functional outcome in patients with dorsally displaced fractures of the distal radius treated with Kirschner wires or volar locking plates. Kirschner wire fixation, however, is cheaper and quicker to perform.

### Volar approach to distal radius fractures [^116CMAnD]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

The volar approach to the distal radius fracture is an important exposure in the treatment of these fractures, particularly with the growing enthusiasm for fixed-angle volar plating. With reports in the literature documenting complications associated with external fixation and dorsal plating, the volar approach has become ever more popular. Moreover, advancements in locking plate technology have expanded the indications for palmar plating beyond volar shear and volarly displaced fractures to include unstable intra-articular distal radius fractures. The surgical approach remains the same as when Henry recommended the interval between the flexor carpi radialis and the radial artery. Critical elements of the surgical technique include releasing the brachioradialis, gaining exposure all the way to the sigmoid notch, and building the intra-articular reduction, beginning with the intermediate column and moving radially. The relevant anatomy, indications and contraindications, postoperative care, and a pertinent case presentation are discussed.

### Recommendations for early surgical intervention in adolescents with salter-harris II (SH2) distal radius fractures [^112cBTUh]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Nonsurgical management is the standard of care for most distal radius fractures involving the epiphyseal plate. However, because of the lack of remodeling potential in adolescents, nonanatomic reduction can result in a symptomatic malunion necessitating late complex surgical correction. Guidelines outlining optimal management strategies for SH2 distal radius fractures in the adolescent population are needed.

Methods

This study is a retrospective review of isolated SH2 distal radius fractures from two, large, regional, referral pediatric ACS trauma level 1 hospitals between 2017 and 2020 in patients aged 9 to 18 years. Patients were identified by Current Procedural Terminology coding associated with their fracture management. Demographics, timing and type of treatment, and fracture displacement at relevant time points were recorded. Bivariate analysis was used to identify predictors of decision for acute surgery and/or correlates with the need for malunion correction. A Classification and Regression Tree model was fit to identify predictors of surgeon decision making for acute surgical intervention.

Results

Sixty (11%) of 556 patients underwent acute surgical intervention following closed reduction. Seventeen cases (3%) were done to correct late malunion. A Classification and Regression Tree model correctly classified the decision for acute surgery in 77% of patients using sagittal translation post reduction of ≥ 35% followed by age at injury of ≥ 12 years. The decision for acute surgery included older patients (median age 13.8 vs. 12.6 years, P < 0.001), with greater coronal (11.6% vs. 0%, P < 0.001) translation, sagittal (30% vs. 0%, P < 0.001) translation and increased dorsal tilt (5.2° vs. 0°, P < 0.001).

Conclusion

Decision for acute surgical intervention of SH2 distal radius fractures is done most often with persistent deformity of sagittal translation ≥ 35% in patients ≥ 12 years following closed reduction at the time of injury. Additional parameters are identified as associated with the decision for acute surgery and progression to symptomatic malunion.

### Distal radioulnar joint, distal ulna injury, and lunate facet considerations in distal radius fractures [^114BCAu9]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2021). Medium credibility.

Summary

Injuries to the distal aspect of the ulna and the distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) commonly occur concurrently with distal radius fractures. These fractures may also involve the sigmoid notch of the lunate facet of the radius. Each of these structures merits consideration when managing ulnar-sided injuries associated with distal radius fractures. Improper management of distal radioulnar complex injuries may result in limited wrist motion, persistent DRUJ instability, and pain despite successful fracture union. The distal ulna is the keystone of the distal radioulnar articulation. An understanding of the components of the distal radioulnar complex and methods to manage injuries of each of these components contributes to improved functional outcomes by restoring this keystone effect. The classification of distal radioulnar injuries discussed herein provides a framework for understanding the disruption of the ligamentous stabilizers of the DRUJ and identifying residual distal radioulnar instability after fracture fixation. Proper treatment of residual DRUJ instability will restore stability and minimize persistent functional impairment.

### Does simultaneous fixation of both distal radius and distal ulnar fractures improve outcomes? A retrospective cohort study [^114GYaTY]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2021). Medium credibility.

Fixation of distal metaphyseal ulnar fractures can be challenging because of comminuted fractures causing difficulties in reduction, osteopenia, or concerns of hardware impingement on the thin, soft tissue envelope. Additionally, a triangular cross-sectional shape of the bone at the subcutaneous border of the ulna can lead to hardware prominence and necessitate implant removal. Interestingly, 78% of fractures were open, and these wounds were located mainly on the ulnar side in our series. All open fractures were classified into Gustilo type I-IIIa, and primary skin closure was possible. However, in some cases, there were some compromised skin conditions at the open fracture site.

Several studies have shown the validity of conservative treatment. - Namba et al. described a technique wherein the distal radial fractures were securely fixed with a palmar plate, leaving the associated ulnar fractures unfixed. Fourteen patients with a mean age of 74 years were treated and followed up at approximately 18 months after surgery. The results were excellent in 11 cases and good in three, and all fracture sites had displayed union, with no instability of the distal radioulnar joint. A widening of the distal radioulnar joint space was present in one patient. Angular deformity of the distal ulnar metaphysis was seen in five wrists. It was concluded that this treatment could be an alternative to open reduction with internal fixation for intra-articular distal ulnar fractures in older adults.

Cha et al. also reported their findings from a prospective case–control study of two treatment methods for unstable distal ulnar fractures associated with distal radius fractures in patients over 65 years of age. The first 29 ulnas were treated surgically, and the next 32 ulnas were treated conservatively. All radial fractures were fixed internally in both groups, and clinical and radiological outcomes were evaluated. The mean duration at the final follow-up was 34 months. There were no significant differences in the clinical and radiological outcomes, including ulnar variance and union rate, between the two groups. No participants from either group demonstrated symptomatic arthritic changes in the radiocarpal joint or distal radioulnar joint at the final follow-up. Thus, in this population, distal ulnar fractures can be successfully managed conservatively when they occur in combination with distal radius fractures.

### Understanding variations in the management of displaced distal radius fractures with satisfactory reduction [^116rgQFT]. Hand (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons has set forth Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs) to help guide management of closed, displaced distal radius fractures (DRFs). There still exists variation in practice regarding operative vs nonoperative decision-making. This study aims to identify which factors influence the decision to treat DRFs not indicated for surgery by the CPGs after initial closed reduction.

Methods

Fifteen sets of DRFs and clinical vignettes were distributed via email to over 75 orthopedic residency programs, Orthopaedic Trauma Association, and New York Society for Surgery of the Hand membership. A Qualtrics survey collected respondent demographics, choice of treatment, and rationale.

Results

Responses were received from 106 surgeons and resident trainees. The odds of selecting operative management for fractures with 5 or more radiographic instability signs versus 3 or 4 was 3.11 (P < .05). Age over 65, higher patient activity level, and dominant-hand injury were associated with greater odds of operative management (3.4, 30.28, and 2.54, respectively). In addition, surgeons with more years in practice and high-volume surgeons had greater odds of selecting operative management (2.43 and 2.11, respectively).

Conclusions

Assessment of instability at the time of injury, patient age and activity level, as well as surgeon volume and time in practice independently affect the decision to manage well-reduced DRF with surgical or nonsurgical treatment. The source of heterogeneity in the treatment of these fractures is borne at least in part from a lack of formal direction on the importance of prereduction instability from the CPGs.

### Percutaneous fixation with kirschner wires versus volar locking plate fixation in adults with dorsally displaced fracture of distal radius: randomised controlled trial [^116yJTuj]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Study population

We enrolled patients from 18 centres in the United Kingdom; all trauma centres and surgeons included in the trial, and indeed in the UK, use both Kirschner wires and locking plates for distal radius fractures. The trial centres included both major trauma centres and smaller emergency hospitals.

Study participants were aged 18 or over and had a dorsally displaced fracture of the distal radius within 3 cm of the radiocarpal joint. The only other inclusion criterion was that the treating surgeon believed that the patient would benefit from surgical fixation of the fracture.

Patients were excluded if they presented more than two weeks after the injury, if the fracture extended more than 3 cm from the radiocarpal joint, if the fracture was open (Gustilo grading > 1), if the articular surface of the fracture could not be reduced by indirect techniques (in some fractures, the joint surface is so badly disrupted that the surgeon will have to open up the fracture to restore the anatomy under direct vision), if there was a contraindication to anaesthesia, or if the patient was unable to complete questionnaires.

Outcome measures

Patients' characteristics and baseline (pre-injury) functional status were self reported after they consented to take part in the trial. The primary outcome measure was the validated patient rated wrist evaluation (PRWE). This rates wrist function in two (equally weighted) sections concerning the patient's experience of pain and disability to give a score out of 100 (with 100 being the worst score). The PRWE, and secondary measures, were collected by postal questionnaire at baseline and at three, six, and 12 months after surgery. The PRWE is the most sensitive outcome measure for patients sustaining this specific injury.

The secondary outcome measures were the disabilities of arm, shoulder, and hand (DASH) score, health related quality of life measured with the EuroQol (EQ-5D), complications related to the surgery, and resource use (reported elsewhere). DASH is a 30 item self report questionnaire (0–100, with 100 indicating greater disability) designed to provide a general measure of physical function and symptoms in people with disorders of the upper limb. The EQ-5D is a validated generalised quality of life questionnaire consisting of five domains of health; patients' responses can be converted to health state utility values, anchored at 1 (perfect health) and 0 (death). Complications were grouped as refracture, neurological injury, vascular injury, tendon injury, superficial wound infection, and deep wound infection.

### Does simultaneous fixation of both distal radius and distal ulnar fractures improve outcomes? A retrospective cohort study [^1154Ar5a]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Fractures of the distal radius tend to be the first fragility fracture among those caused by osteoporosis. Distal metaphyseal ulnar fractures often occur in conjunction with distal radius fractures, especially in elderly patients. Distal radius fractures are often associated with ulnar styloid fractures and less frequently with distal metaphyseal ulnar fractures. In metaphyseal cases, distal radius fractures are usually fixed, but there is no consensus on the optimal management of the concomitant distal ulnar fractures. Several surgical treatment methods have been reported for distal metaphyseal ulnar fractures accompanied by distal radius fractures, such as the conventional plate, locking plate, hook plate, - intramedullary device, and primary resection. Fixation of distal metaphyseal ulnar fractures can be challenging, and several studies have shown the validity of conservative treatment alternatives. - If clinical outcomes of the conservative treatment for distal metaphyseal ulnar fractures accompanying distal radius fractures are the same when compared with those of surgical fixation, there is a possibility that unnecessary surgery can be avoided. This study aimed to determine whether simultaneous fixation of both distal radius and distal metaphyseal ulnar fractures would improve treatment outcomes.

### Novel method for reduction of distal radius fractures [^114emX8u]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2021). Medium credibility.

Summary

Distal radius fractures are one of the most common fractures seen in orthopaedics. These fractures may be treated surgically or conservatively depending on patient-related and radiographic factors. Displaced fractures should be reduced in the acute setting to better align the fracture fragments and a splint applied to hold the fracture in this position. Fractures that are acceptably reduced may be treated conservatively with casting and close radiographic follow-up to ensure maintained alignment. In this video, we describe our technique for closed reduction of distal radius fractures and review important factors that guide treatment.

### Surgical interventions for treating distal radial fractures in adults [^114Fjb2c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Fracture of the distal radius is a common clinical problem, particularly in older white women with osteoporosis.

Objectives

To determine when, and if so what type of, surgical intervention is the most appropriate treatment for fractures of the distal radius in adults.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Injuries Group specialised register (November 2002), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2003), MEDLINE (1966 to February 2003), EMBASE (1988 to 2003 Week 8), CINAHL (1982 to February 2003), the National Research Register (Issue 1, 2003), PEDro, conference proceedings and reference lists of articles. No language restrictions were applied.

Selection Criteria

Randomised or quasi-randomised clinical trials involving skeletally mature patients with a fracture of the distal radius, which compared surgical treatment with conservative treatment, different types of surgical intervention or the duration of immobilisation after surgery. The main categories of surgical intervention were external fixation, percutaneous pinning, open reduction and internal fixation, and the insertion of bone scaffolding materials.

Data Collection and Analysis

All trials, meeting the selection criteria, were independently assessed by both reviewers for methodological quality. Data were extracted for anatomical, functional and clinical outcomes (including complications). The trials were grouped into categories relating to the main comparisons and types of surgical intervention. Despite clear heterogeneity in the characteristics of comparable trials, pooling of data was undertaken where possible and appropriate.

Main Results

Forty eight trials, examining 25 treatment comparisons, met the inclusion criteria of this review. These involved a total of 4371 mainly female and older patients with generally displaced, often comminuted and potentially or evidently unstable fractures. Nearly half of the trials compared surgery with plaster cast immobilisation. Summarising the outcomes was hampered by the variation between the studies in participant characteristics, interventions, quality of trial methodology and reporting, and outcome measurement. Surgical methods were usually associated with better anatomical appearance after fracture healing, but there was inadequate evidence to confirm that these had resulted in better functional and clinical outcomes for the patients.

Reviewer's Conclusions

The 48 randomised trials do not provide robust evidence for most of the decisions necessary in the management of these fractures. Although, in particular, there is some evidence to support the use of external fixation or percutaneous pinning, their precise role and methods are not established. It is also unclear whether surgical intervention of most fracture types will produce consistently better long-term outcomes. There is a need for good quality evidence for the surgical management of these fractures.

### Management of intra-articular distal radius fractures: volar or dorsal locking plate-which has fewer complications? [^1174eaGZ]. Hand (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The aim of this study was to compare the functional outcomes and complications of volar and dorsal plating for the management of intra-articular distal radius fractures, with special regard to indications for dorsal plating. Furthermore, we examine the rationale for choosing dorsal plating and its frequency of use.

Methods

Clinical assessments included range of motion measurements at the wrist; grip strength; the Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand score; and the Gartland and Werley score. Clinical results were compared with those achieved using a volarly placed locking plate system. According to Lutsky's plate theory, the rationale for choosing dorsal plating was based on 4 types of pathologic fractures.

Results

Of 112 patients, 38 patients were treated with open reduction internal fixation via a dorsal approach and 68 patients were treated using a volar approach. Except for wrist flexion, there were no other statistical differences in the clinical results between groups for both subjective and objective parameters. There were no statistically significant differences in the complication rates between the volar and dorsal plated groups. One serious complication occurred after volar plating. The most common reason for choosing dorsal plating was irreducible dorsal die-punch fractures.

Conclusions

The treatment of displaced intra-articular distal radius fractures with a dorsally versus a volarly placed interlocking plate system demonstrated similar clinical results. Postoperative complications were not readily observed in the patients treated with a dorsal locking plate. Certain fracture patterns are more appropriately stabilized using a dorsal plate fixation.

### External fixation techniques for distal radius fractures [^111GvoBJ]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2006). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Fractures of the distal radius are common injuries. Low-energy or high-energy mechanisms may be involved. Unstable distal radius fractures present a challenge to the treating orthopaedic surgeon. External fixation is a valuable instrument for fracture reduction and stabilization. Limited open incisions, early range of motion, and treatment of complex wounds are a few of the benefits of external fixation. Fixators may be spanning or nonbridging and may be used alone or in combination with other stabilization methods to obtain and maintain distal radius fracture reduction. Augmentation with percutaneous wires allows for optimal fracture stabilization with physiologic alignment of the wrist. Moderate distraction at the carpus does not induce postoperative stiffness. The distal radioulnar joint must be assessed and may need to be stabilized. Complications of external fixation are usually minor, but must be anticipated and treated early.

Level Of Evidence

Level V (expert opinion).

### Percutaneous fixation with kirschner wires versus volar locking-plate fixation in adults with dorsally displaced fracture of distal radius: five-year follow-up of a randomized controlled trial [^113cyvzM]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

In 2014, we published the Distal Radius Acute Fracture Fixation Trial (DRAFFT). This compared percutaneous Kirschner wire (K-wire) fixation with volar locking-plate fixation for patients with a dorsally displaced fracture of the distal radius (wrist fracture). The trial showed no evidence of a difference in functional outcome or quality of life for patients at any time during the first year after the injury. The associated health economic evaluation demonstrated that that locking-plate fixation is very unlikely to be cost effective. These findings contradicted much of the existing literature and led to a rapid and substantial change in clinical practice in the United Kingdom.

However, a major criticism of the original DRAFFT report was that it only included one year of follow-up. What if patients developed persistent symptoms that affected their wrist function in the longer-term? What if patients required revision surgery after one year, or required extensive salvage surgery for arthritis?

We therefore present the outcomes at five years of the original DRAFFT trial cohort. The primary objective was to estimate differences in the patient-rated wrist evaluation (PRWE) between those patients treated with K-wire fixation and those treated with locking-plate fixation. Secondary objectives were to estimate differences in health-related quality of life and the need for further surgery related to the fracture.

### Percutaneous fixation with kirschner wires versus volar locking plate fixation in adults with dorsally displaced fracture of distal radius: randomised controlled trial [^116hf2bX]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Objectives To compare the clinical effectiveness of Kirschner wire fixation with locking plate fixation for patients with a dorsally displaced fracture of the distal radius.

Design A multicentre two arm parallel group assessor blind randomised controlled trial with 1:1 treatment allocation.

Setting 18 trauma centres in the United Kingdom.

Participants 461 adults with a dorsally displaced fracture of the distal radius within 3 cm of the radiocarpal joint that required surgical fixation. Patients were excluded if the surgeon thought that the surface of the wrist joint was so badly displaced it required open reduction.

Interventions Kirschner wire fixation: wires are passed through the skin over the dorsal aspect of the distal radius and into the bone to hold the fracture in the correct anatomical position. Locking plate fixation: a locking plate is applied through an incision over the volar (palm) aspect of the wrist and secured to the bone with fixed angle locking screws.

Main outcome measures Primary outcome measure: validated patient rated wrist evaluation (PRWE). This rates wrist function in two (equally weighted) sections concerning the patient's experience of pain and disability to give a score out of 100. Secondary outcomes: disabilities of arm, shoulder, and hand (DASH) score, the EuroQol (EQ-5D), and complications related to the surgery.

Results The baseline characteristics of the two groups were well balanced, and over 90% of patients completed follow-up. The wrist function of both groups of patients improved by 12 months. There was no clinically relevant difference in the patient rated wrist score at three, six, or 12 months (difference in favour of the plate group was −1.3, 95% confidence interval −4.5 to 1.8; P = 0.40). Nor was there a clinically relevant difference in health related quality of life or the number of complications in each group.

Conclusions Contrary to the existing literature, and against the rapidly increasing use of locking plate fixation, this trial found no difference in functional outcome in patients with dorsally displaced fractures of the distal radius treated with Kirschner wires or volar locking plates. Kirschner wire fixation, however, is cheaper and quicker to perform.

### Complications of volar versus low-profile dorsal plating of distal radius fractures [^111TaAeS]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2024). Medium credibility.

Distal radius fractures are one of the most common injuries of the upper extremity. Although nonsurgical management is common, surgical intervention, particularly using volar and dorsal plate fixation, is essential in a subset of injuries. Historically, dorsal plates were avoided due to a high rate of extensor tendon irritation and rupture. Volar locking plates were developed in the early 1990s and first published in 2000 to avoid the complications associated with dorsal plating and have since become widely considered the workhorse for most distal radius fractures. Despite advancements, both fixation methods are still associated with complications, warranting careful selection based on fracture patterns. The purpose of this review is to summarize the most recent literature on the complications associated with the use of volar and low-profile dorsal distal radius plates.

### Management of distal radius fractures: treatment protocol and functional results [^116vMwRP]. Injury (2010). Low credibility.

Distal radius fractures are the most frequent lesions encountered during clinical practice. The treatment is controversial and still debated in the literature. For a correct management of these lesions many authors recently emphasised the importance of anatomical reduction, a stable fixation and early joint mobilisation. We report our experience in the daily management of these lesions. The fractures are evaluated considering fracture type, fracture reduction criteria, adequacy of reduction criteria and overall fracture stability. The best treatment option must be decided in accordance to the type of fracture, the extent of metaphyseal comminution, the quality of the bone and the medical condition of the patient.
