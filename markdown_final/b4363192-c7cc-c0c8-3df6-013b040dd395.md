## Question

Coreg va metoprolol in copd

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how carvedilol (Coreg) compares with metoprolol in patients with COPD, including when to use each, safety, and what the evidence shows. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacologic differences and why they matter in COPD. Then, I should verify the highest-quality randomized and observational evidence in COPD populations. Next, I will review guideline positions and reconcile them with the trial data. After that, I need to consider special scenarios like heart failure, myocardial infarction, and hypertension. Finally, I will synthesize practical recommendations and highlight uncertainties that could change practice.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacologic distinctions because they drive clinical reasoning in obstructive airways disease. Carvedilol is a nonselective beta-blocker with alpha-1 blockade and antioxidant properties, whereas metoprolol is beta-1 selective; in theory, nonselective beta-2 blockade could worsen bronchoconstriction, while beta-1 selectivity should mitigate that risk, though selectivity is dose dependent and not absolute [^9fb9812e] [^5ea9973e].

> Wait, let me verify the direct COPD evidence before drawing conclusions. The BLOCK-COPD randomized trial in patients without a cardiovascular indication found that metoprolol did not reduce time to first COPD exacerbation and increased the risk of exacerbations requiring hospitalization, with more deaths in the metoprolol arm, leading to early termination for futility and safety concerns; this argues against routine metoprolol use in COPD without a cardiac indication [^63b177eb] [^e19a471d]. Hold on, I should also check bisoprolol data; the BICS randomized trial in high-risk COPD without heart failure showed no reduction in exacerbations with bisoprolol versus placebo, suggesting that even more beta-1 selective agents do not improve COPD outcomes in the absence of a cardiovascular indication [^7cea96ee] [^dde14574].

> I need to check whether carvedilol has been tested head-to-head in COPD populations. There are no large randomized trials of carvedilol specifically for COPD outcomes, so most of the carvedilol signal comes from cardiovascular trials and observational cohorts; COMET, a heart failure trial, excluded patients with asthma or COPD, so its mortality advantage of carvedilol over metoprolol cannot be directly extrapolated to COPD, though it informs general HF outcomes [^666131e2]. Let me reconsider: small crossover studies in HF+COPD suggest carvedilol may reduce FEV1 more than metoprolol or bisoprolol, but symptoms and exercise capacity were not consistently worse, and these studies were not powered for hard outcomes, so I should be cautious in interpreting them [^9a688eff] [^6f87a39d].

> Next, I should review guideline positions and make sure I align with them. GOLD advises that beta-blockers should not be used for COPD in the absence of a cardiovascular indication, and when a cardiovascular indication exists, cardioselective beta-blockers are preferred; carvedilol is not singled out as preferred in COPD, and the emphasis is on using cardioselective agents when indicated [^465eba36]. The VA/DoD COPD guideline similarly recommends cardioselective beta-blockers only when there is a cardiovascular indication, reflecting the BLOCK-COPD results and the lack of COPD-specific benefit signals [^5133b59f] [^48622002]. I should double-check: yes, both guidelines converge on indication-driven, cardioselective use rather than routine beta-blockade in COPD [^465eba36] [^5133b59f].

> Now, I will examine the heart failure scenario because that is where beta-blockers are most clearly indicated. In HFrEF, carvedilol, metoprolol succinate, and bisoprolol all reduce mortality; COMET suggested carvedilol may have a mortality edge over metoprolol tartrate, but this has not been reproduced with metoprolol succinate, and contemporary practice accepts any of the three at guideline-directed doses for HFrEF, including patients with COPD when carefully titrated [^9fb9812e] [^666131e2]. Observational data in HFrEF+COPD show beta-blocker use is associated with lower cardiovascular death and heart failure hospitalization without clear increases in severe COPD exacerbations, supporting continuation or initiation when indicated, albeit with close monitoring [^52010a12] [^d272ac91].

> But wait, what if the patient just had a myocardial infarction without overt heart failure. I should confirm the post-MI data in COPD. A prospective cohort of COPD patients after MI found that discharge beta-blocker prescription was not associated with increased risks of death, cardiovascular events, or COPD-related events, supporting beta-blocker use after MI in COPD when otherwise indicated, with no clear preference for carvedilol over metoprolol in this context [^81ac2ab7]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; these are observational, but they are reassuring and consistent with cardiology guidance to use beta-blockers after MI in appropriate patients, including those with COPD [^81ac2ab7].

> I should also consider hypertension without other cardiovascular disease. Here, the balance is unfavorable for beta-blockers in COPD. Guidelines and the BLOCK-COPD trial indicate no COPD benefit and potential harm with metoprolol in the absence of a cardiac indication, so first-line antihypertensives should generally be something other than a beta-blocker in COPD, reserving beta-blockers for compelling reasons like arrhythmia or ischemia [^465eba36] [^63b177eb]. Let me verify: yes, both GOLD and VA/DoD advise against routine beta-blocker use for COPD alone, reinforcing non-beta-blocker choices for hypertension in this population [^465eba36] [^5133b59f].

> I will now examine safety nuances and drug-specific tolerability. Meta-analyses and Cochrane reviews indicate that cardioselective beta-blockers generally do not worsen FEV1 or symptoms in COPD, whereas nonselective agents like propranolol can reduce FEV1 and blunt bronchodilator response; carvedilol sits in between, with some studies showing small FEV1 reductions but often without symptomatic worsening when titrated carefully, especially in the presence of inhaled bronchodilators [^238b91fa] [^9de3fe21] [^59681b60]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought carvedilol might be categorically contraindicated in COPD; the FDA labeling cautions use in bronchospastic disease and advises the lowest effective dose with close monitoring, which is not the same as a formal contraindication, so I should correct that and frame carvedilol as usable with caution when there is a strong cardiovascular indication and careful follow-up [^c49328c4].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach. If there is no cardiovascular indication, avoid beta-blockers in COPD. If there is a cardiovascular indication, choose a cardioselective agent such as metoprolol succinate or bisoprolol and titrate slowly, monitoring symptoms and spirometry if needed. Carvedilol is reasonable for HFrEF when already tolerated or when there are other reasons favoring it, but I should monitor more closely for respiratory symptoms given its beta-2 blockade and consider ensuring optimal bronchodilator therapy, including a LAMA, to mitigate dynamic hyperinflation risks [^465eba36] [^5133b59f] [^7a17168c]. Hold on, I should verify that LAMA coadministration is supported; yes, post hoc and mechanistic data suggest LAMAs can offset beta-blocker–related cholinergic tone and dynamic hyperinflation, which is a useful clinical lever when beta-blockade is necessary [^7a17168c] [^c4cf6c15].

> Finally, I need to ensure I acknowledge uncertainties and future directions. We still lack large, head-to-head randomized trials of carvedilol versus metoprolol specifically in COPD populations, and we do not have definitive evidence that one beta-blocker meaningfully outperforms another for COPD-specific outcomes when a cardiovascular indication exists. Ongoing and future pragmatic trials, as well as better phenotyping of COPD and cardiovascular comorbidity, will refine agent selection and dosing strategies [^db988368] [^8650f1a9]. Until then, I should anchor decisions to cardiovascular indications, prefer cardioselective agents, and individualize monitoring and bronchodilator coadministration to maximize benefit and minimize respiratory risk [^465eba36] [^5133b59f].

In COPD, **carvedilol and metoprolol are both acceptable** when a cardiovascular indication exists, but **carvedilol is preferred** for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) because it reduces mortality more than metoprolol tartrate [^666131e2] and has additional alpha-1 blockade and antioxidant effects [^5b9fc382]. For COPD patients without cardiovascular disease, **neither drug is recommended** because metoprolol increased exacerbation-related hospitalizations in the BLOCK-COPD trial [^63b177eb] and carvedilol lacks supportive COPD-specific evidence. Both agents can cause bronchospasm, so start low, titrate slowly, and monitor symptoms; carvedilol may cause more wheeze due to beta-2 blockade, but this is usually manageable with bronchodilators [^c49328c4] [^9a688eff]. Use cardioselective beta-blockers (e.g. metoprolol or bisoprolol) for arrhythmias or ischemia, and reserve carvedilol for HFrEF when indicated [^9fb9812e].

## Pharmacological differences relevant to COPD

| **Parameter** | **Carvedilol** | **Metoprolol** |
|-|-|-|
| Beta-receptor selectivity | Non-selective (beta-1, beta-2, alpha-1) | Beta-1 selective (cardioselective) |
| Additional properties | - Alpha-1 blockade <br/> - Antioxidant effects <br/> - Vasodilation | Primarily beta-1 blockade |
| Potential respiratory effects | Beta-2 blockade may cause bronchospasm | Lower risk of bronchospasm due to beta-1 selectivity |

## Clinical evidence in COPD

### Carvedilol

- **COMET trial**: Carvedilol reduced all-cause mortality vs metoprolol tartrate in HFrEF, but excluded patients with asthma/COPD, limiting generalizability to COPD [^666131e2].
- **COPD-specific data**: Limited; small studies suggest carvedilol is tolerated in COPD with careful monitoring, but beta-2 blockade can worsen bronchospasm in susceptible patients [^9a688eff] [^c49328c4].
- **VA/DoD guideline**: Recommends cardioselective beta-blockers when indicated; carvedilol is not specifically endorsed for COPD without HFrEF [^5133b59f].

---

### Metoprolol

- **BLOCK-COPD trial**: In COPD without cardiovascular indications, metoprolol increased exacerbation-related hospitalizations and did not reduce exacerbations, arguing against routine use in COPD alone [^63b177eb].
- **Cardioselective beta-blockers**: Generally better tolerated in COPD; Cochrane and subsequent reviews show no significant FEV1 reduction or symptom worsening with cardioselective agents, though vigilance is needed [^238b91fa] [^9de3fe21].
- **VA/DoD guideline**: Supports cardioselective beta-blockers when there is a cardiovascular indication (e.g. HFrEF, MI, arrhythmia) [^5133b59f].

---

## Clinical outcomes and safety

| **Outcome** | **Carvedilol** | **Metoprolol** |
|-|-|-|
| Mortality benefit | Yes, in HFrEF (COMET) [^666131e2] | Yes, in HFrEF and post-MI [^9fb9812e] |
| COPD exacerbations | No clear benefit; potential harm due to beta-2 blockade | Increased exacerbation-related hospitalizations in COPD without CV indication (BLOCK-COPD) [^63b177eb] |
| Bronchospasm risk | Higher due to beta-2 blockade | Lower, but still possible at high doses |
| Guideline recommendation | Preferred in HFrEF; use cautiously in COPD | Acceptable in HFrEF/MI/arrhythmia; avoid in COPD without CV indication |

---

## Practical recommendations

- **With cardiovascular indication (e.g. HFrEF, MI, arrhythmia)**: Carvedilol is preferred for HFrEF due to superior mortality benefit; metoprolol is acceptable for other indications. Start low, titrate slowly, and monitor for bronchospasm [^666131e2] [^9fb9812e].
- **Without cardiovascular indication**: Avoid both carvedilol and metoprolol in COPD alone; metoprolol increased hospitalizations in BLOCK-COPD, and carvedilol lacks supportive COPD data [^63b177eb] [^465eba36].
- **Monitoring**: Watch for dyspnea, wheeze, and reduced FEV1; ensure optimal bronchodilator therapy and adjust the beta-blocker dose if respiratory symptoms worsen [^c49328c4].

---

## Summary of recommendations

Use **carvedilol** for COPD patients with HFrEF because of superior mortality benefit, but monitor closely for bronchospasm. Use **metoprolol** for COPD patients with other cardiovascular indications (e.g. post-MI, arrhythmia), starting low and titrating slowly. Avoid both agents in COPD patients without a cardiovascular indication, as metoprolol increased exacerbation-related hospitalizations and carvedilol lacks supportive COPD-specific evidence.

Background

Observational studies suggest that beta-blockers may reduce the risk of exacerbations and death in patients with moderate or severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but these findings have not been confirmed in randomized trials.

Methods

In this prospective, randomized trial, we assigned patients between the ages of 40 and 85 years who had COPD to receive either a beta-blocker (extended-release metoprolol) or placebo. All the patients had a clinical history of COPD, along with moderate airflow limitation and an increased risk of exacerbations, as evidenced by a history of exacerbations during the previous year or the prescribed use of supplemental oxygen. We excluded patients who were already taking a beta-blocker or who had an established indication for the use of such drugs. The primary end point was the time until the first exacerbation of COPD during the treatment period, which ranged from 336 to 350 days, depending on the adjusted dose of metoprolol.

Results

A total of 532 patients underwent randomization. The mean (± SD) age of the patients was 65.0 ± 7.8 years; the mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1) was 41.1 ± 16.3% of the predicted value. The trial was stopped early because of futility with respect to the primary end point and safety concerns. There was no significant between-group difference in the median time until the first exacerbation, which was 202 days in the metoprolol group and 222 days in the placebo group (hazard ratio for metoprolol vs. placebo, 1.05; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.84 to 1.32; P = 0.66). Metoprolol was associated with a higher risk of exacerbation leading to hospitalization (hazard ratio, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.29 to 2.83). The frequency of side effects that were possibly related to metoprolol was similar in the two groups, as was the overall rate of nonrespiratory serious adverse events. During the treatment period, there were 11 deaths in the metoprolol group and 5 in the placebo group.

Conclusions

Among patients with moderate or severe COPD who did not have an established indication for beta-blocker use, the time until the first COPD exacerbation was similar in the metoprolol group and the placebo group. Hospitalization for exacerbation was more common among the patients treated with metoprolol. (Funded by the Department of Defense; BLOCK COPD ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02587351.).

COPD and cardiovascular disease — clinical trial findings include eligibility definitions and outcomes. One trial comparing inhaler regimens defined stable cardiac disease as no myocardial ischemic event in 6 months, no hospitalization for advanced heart failure, and no life-threatening arrhythmia in 12 months. A post hoc subgroup analysis suggested that among patients with heart failure, those with COPD had similar relative risk reduction with sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors compared with those without COPD, but the absolute risk reduction was greater in those with COPD. Another trial randomized patients with moderate to severe COPD without indications for β-blockers to receive metoprolol and showed no difference in time until exacerbation.

### Beta-blocker therapy in patients with COPD: a systematic literature review and meta-analysis with multiple treatment comparison [^d8df6b65]. Respiratory Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Findings from this analysis represent the most comprehensive and up-to-date available evidence synthesis to assess the effects of beta-blocker use in patients with COPD, spanning data published over four decades. A reduction in COPD exacerbation risk was inferred from observational data while clinical data were pooled to assess lung function. Mortality and quality of life were narratively described owing to high heterogeneity or sparsity of data, respectively. FEV1 was significantly impacted by propranolol, but not by atenolol, bisoprolol, carvedilol, celiprolol, labetalol or metoprolol. In the subset of individuals with CVD, no individual beta-blocker was associated with a reduction in lung function. Treatment choice in patients with COPD should be made according to CVD comorbidity guidelines on management.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^5133b59f]. VA/DoD (2021). High credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) — cardio-selective beta-blockers: In patients with COPD, we suggest starting or continuing cardio-selective beta-blockers only in those who have a cardiovascular indication for beta-blockers (e.g., heart failure with reduced ejection fraction or recent myocardial infarction) (Weak for | Reviewed, Amended). In COPD with cardiovascular indications, observational data suggests that these agents are safe, improve mortality rates, and decrease COPD exacerbations; metoprolol was the only beta-blocker examined by the studies included in the systematic evidence review. In a randomized controlled trial evaluating 100 patients with cardiovascular indications, metoprolol reduced COPD exacerbations and mortality versus placebo without increasing adverse events, although the intended population had cor pulmonale with an N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide level greater than 1,800 picograms/milliliter (pg/mL) and exclusions for reduced ejection fraction or cardiomyopathy were not clearly verified. A systematic review of 18 observational studies reported reduced COPD exacerbations and mortality with beta-blocker use in COPD patients with cardiovascular indications, whereas the β-Blockers (BLOCK) COPD randomized clinical trial of metoprolol in 532 patients without cardiovascular indications was stopped early due to a higher risk of exacerbations and hospitalization associated with beta-blocker use.

### Comparison of carvedilol and metoprolol on clinical outcomes in patients with chronic heart failure in the carvedilol or metoprolol European trial (COMET): randomised controlled trial [^666131e2]. Lancet (2003). Excellent credibility.

The study COMET was published by Poole-Wilson PA and colleagues in 2003 in the journal Lancet. This study is related to the following diseases: Heart failure. In the COMET study, the trial question was: is carvedilol superior to metoprolol on clinical outcomes in patients with chronic HF? In the COMET study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the COMET study, the population was: 3029 patients (612 female, 2417 male). The inclusion criteria were patients chronic HF (NYHA II-IV), previous cardiovascular admission, and LVEF < 35% on optimal medical treatment. The key exclusion criteria were contraindication to use of β-blockers, history of asthma or COPD, PAD with symptoms at rest, or unstable insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. In the COMET study, the interventions were: n = 1511 carvedilol (target dose 25 mg BID) n = 1518 metoprolol (target dose 50 mg BID). In the COMET study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in all-cause death (34% vs. 40%; HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.93). In the COMET study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in death or hospital admission (74% vs. 76%; HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.02). In the COMET study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in incidence of side-effects and drug withdrawals. In the COMET study, the conclusion was: in patients chronic HF (NYHA II-IV), previous cardiovascular admission, and LVEF < 35% on optimal medical treatment, carvedilol was superior to metoprolol with respect to a all-cause death.

### Can β-blockers be used for people with COPD? [^a5966af9]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2011). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a disabling condition characterised by largely irreversible airflow obstruction, and affects over 3 million people in the UK. Due in large part to shared risk factors — notably smoking — patients with COPD often also have cardiovascular diseases, such as ischaemic heart disease and heart failure. In these conditions, beta-blockers are valuable management options with proven benefits on symptoms and mortality. Historically, however, clinicians have been reluctant to prescribe beta-blockers for patients with co-existing COPD, due to fear of provoking bronchoconstriction. Moreover, such patients have typically been excluded from trials of beta-blockers, raising additional concerns about the basis for treating them with these drugs. However, withholding beta-blocker therapy might lead to suboptimal treatment for cardiovascular disease among these patients. Here we review the efficacy and safety of beta-blockers in patients with COPD.

### Differences between β-blockers in patients with chronic heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a randomized crossover trial [^9a688eff]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to determine the respiratory, hemodynamic, and clinical effects of switching between beta1-selective and nonselective beta-blockers in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Background

Carvedilol, metoprolol succinate, and bisoprolol are established beta-blockers for treating CHF. Whether differences in beta-receptor specificities affect lung or vascular function in CHF patients, particularly those with coexistent COPD, remains incompletely characterized.

Methods

A randomized, open label, triple-crossover trial involving 51 subjects receiving optimal therapy for CHF was conducted in 2 Australian teaching hospitals. Subjects received each beta-blocker, dose-matched, for 6 weeks before resuming their original beta-blocker. Echocardiography, N-terminal pro-hormone brain natriuretic peptide, central augmented pressure from pulse waveform analysis, respiratory function testing, 6-min walk distance, and New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class were assessed at each visit.

Results

Of 51 subjects with a mean age of 66 ± 12 years, NYHA functional class I (n = 6), II (n = 29), or III (n = 16), and left ventricular ejection fraction mean of 37 ± 10%, 35 had coexistent COPD. N-terminal pro-hormone brain natriuretic peptide was significantly lower with carvedilol than with metoprolol or bisoprolol (mean: carvedilol 1,001 [95% confidence interval (CI): 633 to 1,367] ng/l; metoprolol 1,371 [95% CI: 778 to 1,964] ng/l; bisoprolol 1,349 [95% CI: 782 to 1,916] ng/l; p < 0.01), and returned to baseline level on resumption of the initial beta-blocker. Central augmented pressure, a measure of pulsatile afterload, was lowest with carvedilol (carvedilol 9.9 [95% CI: 7.7 to 12.2] mm Hg; metoprolol 11.5 [95% CI: 9.3 to 13.8] mm Hg; bisoprolol 12.2 [95% CI: 9.6 to 14.7] mm Hg; p < 0.05). In subjects with COPD, forced expiratory volume in 1 s was lowest with carvedilol and highest with bisoprolol (carvedilol 1.85 [95% CI: 1.67 to 2.03] l/s; metoprolol 1.94 [95% CI: 1.73 to 2.14] l/s; bisoprolol 2.0 [95% CI: 1.79 to 2.22] l/s; p < 0.001). The NYHA functional class, 6-min walk distance, and left ventricular ejection fraction did not change. The beta-blocker switches were well tolerated.

Conclusions

Switching between beta1-selective beta-blockers and the nonselective beta-blocker carvedilol is well tolerated but results in demonstrable changes in airway function, most marked in patients with COPD. Switching from beta1-selective beta-blockers to carvedilol causes short-term reduction of central augmented pressure and N-terminal pro-hormone brain natriuretic peptide.

### Differences between bisoprolol and carvedilol in patients with chronic heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a randomized trial [^6f87a39d]. Respiratory Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) frequently coexists in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) and is a key factor for beta blocker underprescription and underdosing. This study compared effects of bisoprolol and carvedilol in patients with both conditions.

Methods

This was a randomized open-label study, of bisoprolol and carvedilol during initiation and uptitration to target or maximal tolerated dose. Pulmonary function testing, 12-lead electrocardiogram, and N-terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide were measured at baseline and follow-up.

Results

We randomized 63 elderly patients (73 ± 9 years, 81% men, left ventricular ejection fraction 33 ± 7%) with mild to moderate CHF (54% New York Heart Assocation class II) and moderate to severe COPD (76% Global initiative for chronic Obstructive Lung Disease stage 2). Target dose was tolerated by 31 (49%) patients and 19 (30%) patients experienced adverse events during follow-up (19% bisoprolol, 42% carvedilol, p = 0.045). Study medication had to be withdrawn in 8 (13%) patients (bisoprolol: 2 due to hypotension, 1 due to bradycardia; carvedilol: 2 due to hypotension and 1 due to wheezing, dyspnoea, and oedema, respectively). Forced expiratory volume in 1(st) second significantly increased in bisoprolol (1561 ± 414 mL to 1698 ± 519 ml, p = 0.046) but not carvedilol (1704 ± 484 to 1734 ± 548, p = 0.44) group. Both agents reduced heart rate (bisoprolol: 75 ± 14 to 68 ± 10, p = 0.007; carvedilol 78 ± 14 to 72 ± 12, p = 0.016) and had no effect on N-terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide.

Conclusions

Beta blockers frequently caused adverse events, and thus 49% of patients could tolerate the target dose. Bisoprolol induced demonstrable improvement in pulmonary function and caused less adverse events.

### Beta-blocker therapy in patients with COPD: a systematic literature review and meta-analysis with multiple treatment comparison [^73de75a8]. Respiratory Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Quality of life

SGRQ was assessed in two RCTs and one observational study, but none reported mean change from baseline to follow-up per treatment arm. One RCT compared metoprolol to placebo and one observational study assessed any beta-blocker compared to lack of beta-blocker treatment; both reported no significant difference in SGRQ between the two treatment arms at one-year follow-up (Additional file 1: Table S12).

12MWT was investigated in two RCTs; one study investigated atenolol and metoprolol vs. placebo, which did not report a mean change in score at four weeks follow-up; the second study did not find a significant difference in distance walked between patients that received metoprolol vs. propranolol six hours after treatment was administered (Additional file 1: Table S13).

Data on 6MTW was reported in two recent RCTs from 2017, respectively 2019. The first evaluated the effect of bisoprolol compared to carvedilol and did not present mean change between treatment groups, however the calculated estimates suggest both agents decreased distance walked in patients with COPD with no difference apparent between the two; the second trial did not identify a significant difference between the metoprolol and placebo on 6MWT (Additional file 1: Table S14).

Data on SF-36 was available in one observational study. Whilst overall scores were not available per treatment group, authors reported no significant association between beta-blocker treatment and individual domains of the quality of life assessment tool, either at baseline or 6.4 years follow-up (Additional file 1: Table S15).

Risk of bias

Observational studies were mostly judged to have moderate risk of bias (23 studies), two studies were considered to be of low risk of bias, one had serious risk of bias and one did not provide enough information for a judgment to be made. The domains of bias which were mostly affected by a "moderate rating" were "bias due to confounding" and "bias in selection of participants into study" as the majority of studies included patients recruited from databases which did not provide clinical diagnoses and relied on ICD coding (without confirming validity of diagnosis) (Additional file 1: Table S16). Ten RCTs had moderate risk of bias, denoted by ratings of "some concerns"; two studies were deemed of serious risk of bias, both due to the lack of blinding (Additional file 1: Figure S9).

### Beta-blocker therapy in patients with COPD: a systematic literature review and meta-analysis with multiple treatment comparison [^9de3fe21]. Respiratory Research (2021). Medium credibility.

FEV1

FEV1 was assessed in 199 patients enrolled in 12 RCTs and we found that none of the individual cardioselective beta-blockers included in our NMA (atenolol, bisoprolol, celiprolol, metoprolol) were associated with significant effects on lung function in patients with COPD, regardless of baseline FEV1 or follow-up time. This is in line with a Cochrane review which concluded that cardioselective beta-blockers given in either single dose or for longer durations, do not affect FEV1 in patients with COPD, even in those with the lowest baseline FEV1 measurements. Furthermore, our report extends to incorporate a lack of effect on FEV1 of non-selective beta-blockers such as carvedilol and labetalol. Propranolol was the only medication found to be associated with a reduction of 140 mL in FEV1 (95% CrI: -0.28, -0.016), which is larger than the threshold of 100 mL change deemed clinically significant by the American Thoracic Society and European Respiratory Society guidelines. This result is based on high quality evidence, according to the GRADE assessment (Additional file 1: Table S19), and thus supports current recommendations to not use this medication in patients with COPD.

### Bisoprolol in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease at high risk of exacerbation: the BICS randomized clinical trial [^7cea96ee]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Observational studies report that β-blocker use may be associated with reduced risk of COPD exacerbations. However, a recent trial reported that metoprolol did not reduce COPD exacerbations and increased COPD exacerbations requiring hospital admission.

Objective

To test whether bisoprolol decreased COPD exacerbations in people with COPD at high risk of exacerbations.

Design, Setting, and Participants

The Bisoprolol in COPD Study (BICS) was a double-blind placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial conducted in 76 UK sites (45 primary care clinics and 31 secondary clinics). Patients with COPD who had at least moderate airflow obstruction on spirometry (ratio of forced expiratory volume in the first second of expiration [FEV1] to forced vital capacity < 0.7; FEV1 < 80% predicted) and at least 2 COPD exacerbations treated with oral corticosteroids, antibiotics, or both in the prior 12 months were enrolled from October 17, 2018, to May 31, 2022. Follow-up concluded on April 18, 2023.

Interventions

Patients were randomly assigned to bisoprolol (n = 261) or placebo (n = 258). Bisoprolol was started at 1.25 mg orally daily and was titrated as tolerated during 4 sessions to a maximum dose of 5 mg/d, using a standardized protocol.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary clinical outcome was the number of patient-reported COPD exacerbations treated with oral corticosteroids, antibiotics, or both during the 1-year treatment period. Safety outcomes included serious adverse events and adverse reactions.

Results

Although the trial planned to enroll 1574 patients, recruitment was suspended from March 16, 2020, to July 31, 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Two patients in each group were excluded postrandomization. Among the 515 patients (mean [SD] age, 68 [7.9] years; 274 men [53%]; mean FEV1, 50.1%), primary outcome data were available for 514 patients (99.8%) and 371 (72.0%) continued taking the study drug. The primary outcome of patient-reported COPD exacerbations treated with oral corticosteroids, antibiotics, or both was 526 in the bisoprolol group, with a mean exacerbation rate of 2.03/y, vs 513 exacerbations in the placebo group, with a mean exacerbation rate of 2.01/y. The adjusted incidence rate ratio was 0.97 (95% CI, 0.84–1.13; P = 0.72). Serious adverse events occurred in 37 of 255 patients in the bisoprolol group (14.5%) vs 36 of 251 in the placebo group (14.3%; relative risk, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.62–1.66; P = 0.96).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among people with COPD at high risk of exacerbation, treatment with bisoprolol did not reduce the number of self-reported COPD exacerbations requiring treatment with oral corticosteroids, antibiotics, or both.

### Beta-blocker therapy in patients with COPD: a systematic literature review and meta-analysis with multiple treatment comparison [^b4a71f9d]. Respiratory Research (2021). Medium credibility.

A recent RCT comparing metoprolol with placebo failed to find a significant effect on FEV1, but reported worsening of dyspnea and overall COPD symptoms, suggestive of respiratory effects not captured by spirometry. This confirms the need to evaluate a spectrum of respiratory outcomes to fully assess the implications of beta-blocker treatment in patients with COPD, which needs to be addressed in future studies

Confounding by contraindication is likely to affect interpretation of results — if we assume clinicians knowingly withheld treatment from patients due to concerns regarding breathlessness, this may have resulted in a reduced sample size of possible COPD patients who may have been eligible for beta-blocker therapy. Alternatively, doctors may prescribe beta-blockers to less severe patients, limiting generalizability.

Our AECOPD analysis is also limited by a low number of included studies, all of which were observational — we identified one RCT only (evaluating metoprolol). This reinstates the need of more carefully conducted RCTs to evaluate a range of beta-blockers and their effects of AECOPD, in order to validate observational data.

### Therapeutic update: non-selective β-and α-adrenergic blockade in patients with coexistent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and chronic heart failure [^5b9fc382]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

Patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) have a resting restrictive ventilatory defect. Any type of exercise requires patients with CHF to markedly increase their minute ventilation. Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have airflow obstruction that leads to dynamic lung hyperinflation and reduced ventilatory response to exercise. Because exercise is associated with abnormally high minute ventilation in patients with CHF and with a limited minute ventilation increase in patients with COPD, functional capacity is severely impaired in patients with coexistent CHF and COPD. Optimal treatment of both conditions is a prerequisite to maximally improve functional capacity in patients with CHF and COPD. Unfortunately, beta-adrenergic blockade, the current cornerstone of CHF therapy, is frequently omitted in patients with CHF and COPD for fear of inducing bronchoconstriction. Furthermore, when prescribed, beta-adrenergic blockade is often attempted with a moderate dose of metoprolol tartrate, a beta-1-blocker that results in lesser clinical benefits than combined non-selective beta-blockade with carvedilol at the maximally recommended dose. Recent experience indicates that combined non-selective beta- and alpha-blockade with carvedilol is well tolerated in patients with COPD who do not have reversible airway obstruction. Alpha-adrenergic blockade may promote mild bronchodilation that offsets non-selective beta blockade-induced bronchoconstriction in patients with obstructive airway disease.

### Titration to target dose of bisoprolol vs. carvedilol in elderly patients with heart failure: the CIBIS-ELD trial [^622fdc7e]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2011). Low credibility.

Pharmacological differences and pulmonary function

Beta-blockers are frequently not up-titrated or even withheld for fear of bronchoconstriction.

In this trial carvedilol was associated with more pulmonary adverse events than bisoprolol and with a reduction of FEV 1, which is in line with its pharmacodynamic properties. Incidence of pulmonary adverse events was nonetheless moderate in both groups. In contrast to pre-existing opinions, neither these adverse events nor the reduction in FEV 1 with carvedilol were a significant limitation for up-titration. Furthermore, the presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which was the most powerful independent predictor of beta-blocker underutilization in the EuroHeart Failure Survey, was not predictive of less ability to titrate dose upwards in our trial. In a study that looked specifically at heart failure patients with COPD receiving bisoprolol or placebo, bisoprolol was associated with a 5% reduction in FEV 1. However, this did not cause pulmonary symptoms or impair QoL.

### Association of β-blocker use with survival and pulmonary function in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary and cardiovascular disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^2de74a07]. European Heart Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

Protocol and guidance

This systematic review and meta-analysis followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.

Eligibility criteria

This study evaluated the effects of BBs on patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease from two perspectives. First, the differences in survivability and heart rate were compared between patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who took BBs for a long time and those who did not take BBs. The inclusion criteria were as follows: patients: patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with one or various CVDs; intervention: BB therapy (including cardioselective BBs, noncardioselective BBs, or both); control: patients who did not receive BB therapy; outcome: hazard ratio (HR) of survival and mean difference (MD) of heart rate; and study design: observational cohort or case–control study.

Second, BBs were compared with controls in randomized trials. The methods and results of this section are presented in Supplementary material online, Secondary outcomes.

Information sources and search strategy

We searched for articles published before 30 September 2019, regardless of language or data, in four electronic databases: PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science. The articles were selected by manual screening. Our search strategy was audited by a medical librarian. The following terms were used in the searches: ("chronic obstructive lung disease" OR "COPD" OR "chronic obstructive emphysema" OR "chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder") and ("beta blocker" OR "beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent" OR "BB" OR "β adrenergic receptor blocking agent" OR "acebutolol" OR "atenolol" OR "betaxolol" OR "bisoprolol" OR "carvedilol" OR "labetalol" OR "metoprolol" OR "nadolol" OR "nebivolol" OR "penbutolol" OR "pindolol" OR "propranolol" OR "sotalol" OR "esmolol" OR "levobunolol" OR "oxprenolol").

### Underuse of β-blockers in heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^62b35b61]. Heart (2016). Low credibility.

We found that the use of non-selective β-blockers such as carvedilol was about 10%, irrespective of the presence of concomitant COPD. This can perhaps be explained by the reticence of clinicians to use non-selective β-blockers in general, along with a lack of evidence to support any difference in efficacy in HF compared with selective antagonists. Carvedilol blocks both cardiac β-1 and β-2 receptors and causes peripheral vasodilatation due to α-receptor antagonism. The antioxidant activity of carvedilol may explain why in one trial it was found to be superior to metoprolol in patients with HF. A 6-week study comparing bisoprolol, metoprolol and carvedilol in patients with COPD and HF showed that central augmented pressure (a measure of cardiac afterload) and levels of N-terminal brain natriuretic peptide (a marker of left ventricular function) were both lower with carvedilol and that it also reduced FEV 1. However, in a post hoc analysis of 2670 patients with HF, there were no differences between selective and non-selective β-blockers in terms of lower mortality or rehospitalisation in patients with and without COPD. A small retrospective observational study from Japan showed the use of bisoprolol was associated with fewer exacerbations than carvedilol in patients with COPD and HF. Ivabradine may be used as an alternative to produce heart rate reduction in HF, but does not confer other beneficial properties of β-blockers.

It is also important to consider the potential impact of β-2 receptor genotype on the response to β-blockers in COPD. Patients with persistent asthma who possess one or two copies of the arginine-16 β-2 receptor polymorphism are more prone to propranolol-induced bronchoconstriction, while the same polymorphism confers a worse outcome on survival in patients who are receiving metoprolol post ACS. However, in another post hoc analysis of patients with HF treated with metoprolol or carvedilol, no association with survival was seen for the arginine-16 polymorphism.

COPD and HF often coexist in patients, and indeed, both often coexist with other comorbidities. We hypothesised that the underuse of β-blockers in patients with comorbid COPD and HF may occur because doctors perceive that they will prevent drug interactions. Further research is required into other comorbid conditions that influence underuse of β-blockers.

### Bisoprolol versus celiprolol on dynamic hyperinflation, cardiopulmonary exercise and domiciliary safety in COPD: a single-centre, randomised, crossover study [^c4cf6c15]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

The morbidity and mortality of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are frequently compounded by comorbid incident cardiovascular disease. Indeed, COPD is itself a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, due to the shared risks of smoking, increasing COPD severity over time and exacerbations. Ischaemic heart disease, cardiac failure and cardiac arrhythmias are particularly prevalent as comorbid pathologies in COPD but may go unrecognised due to the burden of symptoms attributed to COPD alone.

Cardioselective beta-blockers are one of the pillars of treatment for these cardiovascular diseases in the general population. However, beta-blockers are chronically underutilised for these indications in patients with COPD. This is driven by clinical concern over worsening airflow obstruction, resulting in increased breathlessness and reduced exercise capacity. Furthermore, greater dynamic hyperinflation (DH) during exercise on blockade of the airway beta-2 adrenoceptors occurs, thus increasing breathlessness further. Pointedly, this risk may be more significant when airway calibre is not protected by a concomitant long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) that blocks the bronchoconstrictor effect of unopposed acetylcholine transmission across airway neuromuscular junctions, itself precipitated by pre and postjunctional beta-2 adrenoceptor blockade.

Cardioselective beta-blockers do, however, provide a degree of protection in this regard by more selectively blocking beta-1 over beta-2 adrenoceptors. Nevertheless, the various cardioselective beta-blockers in clinical use are pharmacologically diverse, with some more cardioselective than others. For example, bisoprolol is approximately six times more selective towards the beta-1 adrenoceptor (13.5:1) than metoprolol (2.3:1) despite both being similarly classified as cardioselective agents per se. Retrospective observational studies have suggested that cardioselective beta-blockers are not only safebut may also improve survival in COPD even without overt cardiovascular disease. However, a more recent prospective study has cast some doubt on their safety, with metoprolol leading to a greater propensity for severe or very severe exacerbations compared with placebo in patients without overt cardiovascular disease, although the overall exacerbation and mortality rates were no different.

### Use of β-blockers in patients with COPD [^aa7bbcc8]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the safety and cardiovascular benefits of beta-blocker therapy in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Data Sources

Clinical literature was accessed through MEDLINE (1966-February 2003). Key search terms included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and adrenergic beta-antagonists.

Data Synthesis

beta-Blockers are often avoided in patients with COPD because of fear of bronchoconstriction, despite the known cardiovascular mortality benefits. A review of studies evaluating the use of beta-blockers in COPD was undertaken.

Conclusions

The literature supports the safety and mortality benefits of using beta-blockers in COPD. Patients with mild to moderate COPD should receive cardioselective beta-blocker therapy when a strong indication exists.

### Beta-blocker therapy in patients with COPD: a systematic literature review and meta-analysis with multiple treatment comparison [^8d263a93]. Respiratory Research (2021). Medium credibility.

For the first time reported in the literature, we aimed to rank beta-blockers with respect to their effect on lung function. Propranolol had the lowest probability of being ranked first (suggesting worse impact on lung function), compared to all other individual treatments considered in our NMA, including placebo. Labetalol and celiprolol — drugs used in hypertension — were the least likely drugs to negatively impact FEV1, compared to all other beta-blockers; however, neither affected FEV1 with certainty compared to placebo and results were inferred from very low quality evidence according to GRADE (Additional file 1: Table S18), bringing into question their leading positions in the hierarchy. Since choice of beta-blocker may be influenced by CVD comorbidity (i.e. carvedilol, metoprolol and bisoprolol are recommended in stable HF; atenolol is more often prescribed in patients with asymptomatic hypertension, while bisoprolol is also used in atrial fibrillation, and propranolol is infrequently used to treat tachyarrhythmias), it is perhaps not surprising that we did not identify a clear "best" beta-blocker to be used in COPD. The fact that the beta-blockers less likely to decrease lung function are mainly used to treat hypertension may just reflect this subgroup of patients could be less prone to detrimental side-effects (i.e. indication bias), compared to others with COPD and more severe comorbidities. Indeed, the prescription of beta-blockers in COPD needs to consider clinically significant lung function alteration vs. mortality benefits in those with CVD, particularly MI and HF.

### Beta-blocker use in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a systematic review: a systematic review of β B in COPD [^b035c13d]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Beta-blockers (βB) are a frequently used class of medications. Although βB have many indications, those related to cardiovascular disease are among the most common and important. However, in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), βB are used less often due to concerns about an unfavorable impact on respiratory morbidity and mortality. We performed a systematic review to assess the safety of βB in patients with COPD. We included a total of 2 randomized controlled trials and 28 observational studies. The majority found statistically significant reductions in mortality. The two higher quality observational studies reported increased mortality with βB. The risk of COPD exacerbations was reduced in about half of the studies. Nonetheless, there were significant biases that confounded the results. The highest quality RCT found a significant increase in severe and very severe COPD exacerbations with βB use. In conclusion, data on the safety of βB in patients with COPD are conflicting. However, given higher quality evidence showed harm with their use, βB should be prescribed with caution in patients with COPD, including patients with cardiac indication for βB.

### Is bisoprolol underutilized in U.S. Heart Failure patients? [^8650f1a9]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

It is possible that these discordant results are merely due to chance and furthermore, even if a true difference exists, it does not necessarily follow that this difference is attributable to the superior β-1 selectivity of bisoprolol. The authors of BICS point out that "BLOCK-COPD patients had more severe COPD (mean FEV1, 40% vs 50% predicted; long-term oxygen use 40% vs 5%), concomitant long-acting muscarinic antagonist was used less frequently (73% vs 90%), and there may have been more cardiovascular comorbid conditions (coronary artery disease, 15% vs 4%; hypertension 46% vs 30%; and diabetes, 16% vs 11%)". In addition, since both of these trials excluded any patient that had a class I indication for a β-blocker, we can only speculate about how these drugs compare in that group of patients.

In conclusion, there does appear to be compelling (although far from definitive) pharmacological, physiological, and clinical data to suggest that bisoprolol could be superior to metoprolol in patients with COPD and/or asthma. A pragmatic clinical trial designed similarly to the Diuretic Comparison Project(which randomly assigned patients to either hydrochlorothiazide or chlorthalidone) could be performed to help clarify whether one agent should be preferred over another. In the meantime, we encourage cardiologists in the United States to keep bisoprolol in mind when choosing a β-blocker in patients who suffer from obstructive lung disease.

AECOPD

We found evidence to suggest that patients with COPD who are given beta-blockers are at decreased risk of AECOPD (HR 0.78 [95%CI 0.74–0.82]), replicating findings from Du and colleagues who report an even larger reduction in risk, of 37% (RR 0.63 [95% CI, 0.57–0.71]). However, this previous meta-analysis, had methodological limitations inherent to the observational nature of the pooled studies (i.e. residual confounding, immortal time bias), which may limit generalizability of results. However, the GRADE assessment revealed the body of observational evidence on which our estimate was derived was of "low" quality (Additional file 1: Table S19). A recent RCT, less likely to be affected by the biases of previous observational studies, found no significant difference between metoprolol and placebo on the time to AECOPD of any severity, but revealed a significant increase in risk of AECOPD requiring hospitalization, in patients with COPD without an indication for beta-blocker treatment, bringing into question the protective effect of this specific beta-blocker agent.

However, this trial did not evaluate other beta-blockers, therefore future RCTs evaluating multiple regimens, are needed to confirm the benefit of these agents. Whether beta-blockers have an indirect effect on exacerbations of COPD could be assessed in clinical trials including patients with COPD and comorbid CVD, allowing assessment of these agents in a more representative COPD population.

### Is bisoprolol underutilized in U.S. Heart Failure patients? [^3ecfb8e8]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Recently, two randomized clinical trials have provided intriguing data regarding the effects of metoprolol and bisoprolol in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who did not have heart failure. BLOCK-COPD (Beta-Blockers for the Prevention of Acute Exacerbations of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease)randomized 532 patients without class I indications for β-blockers to either placebo or metoprolol succinate. BICS (Bisoprolol in COPD Study) randomized 519 patients to placebo or bisoprolol. The two trials share many similarities: they included patients with at least moderate airflow limitation and at least 1 (2 in the case of BICS) COPD exacerbation in the year preceding enrollment. The treatment drugs also were titrated up to equivalent maximal doses. BICS aimed for a maximum of 5 mg bisoprolol (half of the 10 mg maximum dose in the CIBIS-II [Cardiac Insufficiency Bisoprolol Study II] trial that proved a mortality benefit in patients with HFrEF). Similarly, BLOCK-COPD set a goal of 100 mg of metoprolol (again, half the 200 mg used in MERIT-HF [Metoprolol CR/XL Randomised Intervention Trial in Congestive Heart Failure]). Both trials were undertaken with the hope that a β-blocker would decrease the number of COPD exacerbations, based on associations reported in observational studies. Compared with placebo, metoprolol was actually associated with a significantly increased rate of COPD exacerbations that led to hospitalization, or hospitalization plus intubation (rate ratio: 1.6; 95% CI: 1.10–2.42). In BICS, bisoprolol was not associated with any such increase. Both trials reported a significant increase in patient's subjective feelings of dyspnea in the treatment group.

### Beta-blocker use and COPD mortality: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^f77d1ad2]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Beta-blockers are one of the most prescribed classes of cardiovascular medications. In clinical trials they have been shown to lower morbidity and mortality secondary to congestive heart failure (CHF) and coronary artery disease (CAD). Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a progressive debilitating lung disease and currently the third leading cause of death in North America. Many patients with COPD also have concomitant CAD. There has been uncertainty with regard to using beta-blockers in COPD patients mainly because of concerns that they might induce bronchospasm and worsen lung function, especially in those patients who have a combination of asthma and COPD.

Despite these concerns, there is emerging evidence that beta-blockers may be beneficial in patients with COPD. In one systematic review of 19 randomised controlled trials that included patients with both asthma and COPD, beta-blockers lowered FEV 1 by 7.46% (95% CI, 5.59%-9.32%). Results from this meta-analysis prompted guidelines to recommend the use of low dose beta-blockers in COPD patients.

Recent studies have also shown that beta-blockers may lower mortality in COPD patients. This potential benefit may arise from a possible protective effect of beta-blockers in patients with established CAD in whom these drugs may be underused. Beta-blockers may also be beneficial in patients with CAD and overlapping CHF. Finally, similar to statins, beta-blockers, especially cardio-selective beta-blockers such as carvedilol, may exert pleiotropic effects including antioxidant and alpha-adrenorecptor blocking properties. As of to date, no systematic review specifically addressing mortality benefit with beta-blockers in COPD patients has been conducted. We sought to address these questions with respect to a clinically important outcome mainly all cause mortality by undertaking a systematic review and meta-analysis.

### Underuse of β-blockers in heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^5ea9973e]. Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Bronchoconstriction from β-blocker use is due to antagonism of prejunctional and postjunctional β-2 receptors, which uncovers cholinergic tone resulting in airway constriction. Hence, LAMAs may serendipitously prevent bronchoconstriction induced by β-blocker. In this study, 89% of patients were taking cardioselective β-blockers, the most common being bisoprolol. One concern among prescribers is β-1 selective antagonists potentially exhibiting a small degree of dose-related β-2 receptor blockade. In a randomised controlled trial of 27 patients with HF who had concomitant moderate-to-severe COPD, there was a 190 mL significant difference in FEV 1 between bisoprolol and placebo after 4 months of treatment. In patients with mild-to-moderate COPD, there was a significant increase in methacholine-induced airway hyper-reactivity after treatment with metoprolol or propranolol, but not celiprolol, in comparison with placebo. In 2712 patients with COPD who were followed over 4.3 years, there was no adverse effect of cardioselective β-blockade on either FEV 1 or forced vital capacity, even in patients with the most severe COPD who were receiving inhaled triple therapy. In a meta-analysis of trials with cardioselective β-blockers, there was no significant change in FEV 1 compared with placebo after a single or chronic dosing, while the FEV 1 response to β-2 agonists was not affected. The β-blockers currently licensed for HF are the β-1 selective bisoprolol, nebivolol, metoprolol and the non-selective carvedilol. Gradually titrating up the dose of β-blocker to improve cardiovascular and pulmonary tolerability is important. Bisoprolol exhibits a higher in vitro β-1/2 receptor selectivity ratio (14:1) compared with atenolol (5:1) or metoprolol (2:1).

### Diagnostic and therapeutic gaps in Patients with heart Failure and chronic Obstructive pulmonary Disease [^26e2364f]. JACC: Heart Failure (2019). Medium credibility.

Heart failure (HF) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) coincide in a significant number of patients. Recent population-based registries suggest that spirometry is largely underused in patients with HF to diagnose comorbid COPD and that patients with COPD frequently do not receive the recommended beta-blocker (BB) treatment. This state-of-the-art review summarizes: 1) current challenges in the implementation of recommended spirometry for COPD diagnosis in patients with HF; and 2) current underuse and underdosing of BBs in patients with HF and COPD despite guideline recommendations. Open issues in the therapeutic management of patients with HF and COPD are discussed in the third section, including the use of the nonselective BB carvedilol, target BB doses in patients with HF and COPD, BB and bronchodilator management during HF hospitalization with and without COPD exacerbation, and the use of BBs in patients with COPD with right HF or free from cardiovascular disease. The whole scenario described herein advocates for a bipartisan initiative to drive immediate attention to the translation of guideline recommendations into clinical practice for patients with HF with co-occurring COPD.

### Β-blocker use and clinical outcomes in patients with COPD following acute myocardial infarction [^471a1a76]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the third leading cause of mortality worldwide, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) accounts for a large proportion of deaths in patients with COPD. Randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that β-blockers reduce the risk of death and reinfarction after acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and observational studies also suggest a potential benefit of β-blockers in patients with COPD even in the absence of a cardiac indication to receive the drug. The Beta-Blockers for the Prevention of Acute Exacerbations of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (BLOCK-COPD) study was a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial investigating the effect of metoprolol on exacerbation risk in COPD. The study examined the hypothesis that metoprolol would reduce exacerbation risk without an increase in adverse events. It was stopped early due to futility and safety concerns after an interim analysis indicated no difference in risk of any exacerbation but found a higher incidence of exacerbations requiring hospitalization in those assigned to receive metoprolol. These results suggested that β-blockers should not be prescribed to patients who have COPD with high exacerbation risk without a clear indication (eg, AMI, congestive heart failure). Notably, the clinical trials that demonstrated the cardiovascular benefits of β-blockers excluded patients with COPD, and it is therefore unknown whether the benefits of β-blockers following AMI extend to individuals with COPD. Prior observational studies of this question were affected by confounding due to historical avoidance of β-blockers in patients with more severe COPD, and were also limited by a retrospective design, inadequate characterization of included patients with COPD, and incomplete follow-up data for respiratory events including COPD exacerbations. This knowledge gap provided the impetus for a contemporary study of the potential risks of β-blockers in patients with COPD who experience AMI, with robust characterization of participants and close longitudinal follow-up for cardiovascular and respiratory events.

We therefore performed a prospective, multicenter cohort study at sites in the BLOCK-COPD network to investigate differences in outcomes among patients with COPD following hospitalization for AMI who were discharged with vs without a β-blocker. The objectives of our study were to (1) determine the prevalence of COPD and disease-specific characteristics in patients admitted for AMI and (2) to investigate whether prescription for any β-blocker at hospital discharge was associated with higher risk of adverse cardiopulmonary outcomes.

### Metoprolol versus carvedilol in patients with heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, and renal failure [^18cc689d]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

This study compared the survival and the risk of heart failure (HF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus (DM), hypoglycemia, and renal failure (RF) hospitalizations in geriatric patients exposed to carvedilol or metoprolol. Data sources were Danish administrative registers. Patients aged ≥ 65 and having HF, COPD, and DM were followed for 1 year from the first β-blocker prescription redemption. Patients' characteristics were used to 1:1 propensity score match carvedilol and metoprolol users. A Cox regression model was used to compute the hazard ratio (HR) of study outcomes. For statistically significant associations, a conditional inference tree was used to assess predictors most associated with the outcome. In total, 1,424 patients were included. No statistically significant differences were observed for survival (HR 0.86; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.67 to 1.11, p = 0.240) between carvedilol/metoprolol users. The same applied to COPD (HR 0.88; 95% CI 0.75 to 1.05, p = 0.177), DM (HR 0.95; 95% CI 0.82 to 1.10, p = 0.485), hypoglycemia (HR 0.88; 95% CI 0.47 to 1.67, p = 0.707), and RF (HR 1.25; 95% CI 0.93 to 1.69, p = 0.142) hospitalizations. Carvedilol users had a 38% higher hazard then metoprolol users of HF hospitalization during the follow-up period (HR 1.38; 95% CI 1.19 to 1.60, p < 0.001). Artificial intelligence identified carvedilol exposure as the most important predictor for HF hospitalization. In conclusion, we found an increased risk of HF hospitalization for carvedilol users with this triad of diseases but no statistically significant differences in survival or risk of COPD, DM, hypoglycemia, and RF hospitalizations.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^3da0b08f]. VA/DoD (2021). High credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) — cardio-selective beta-blockers and cardiovascular (CV) indications: The Work Group characterized this as a Reviewed, Amended recommendation, with confidence in the quality of the evidence very low and the body of evidence limited to two RCTs with relatively small sample sizes. They considered that the harms of using cardio-selective beta-blockers in patients with COPD and hypertension without any other CV requirements outweigh the benefits. In patients with a CV indication, beta-blocker use was associated with decreased COPD exacerbations and mortality, without an increase in adverse events, whereas without a CV indication beta-blockers are associated with a higher risk of exacerbations and hospitalizations. There was limited evidence in COPD with overlapping asthma, and the Work Group decided upon a Weak for recommendation.

Beta-blocker therapy effect on FEV1 in patients with COPD with and without explicit CVD

Data from eight trials evaluating six beta-blockers (atenolol, bisoprolol, carvedilol, celiprolol, metoprolol, and propranolol) in 137 patients with COPD and no explicit CVD were evaluated. No significant difference in FEV1 was detected when comparing each of the active treatments with placebo (Additional file 1: Figure S5A). Additional file 1: Figure S6 shows celiprolol was similarly likely to rank first in terms of increasing FEV1, while the second rank was surprisingly obtained by placebo, then celiprolol. There were four trials investigating six beta-blockers (carvedilol, bisoprolol, atenolol, propranolol, metoprolol, labetalol) in patients with COPD and CVD. No significant difference in FEV1 was detected when comparing each of the active treatments with placebo (Additional file 1: Figure S5B, Additional file 1: Figure S7).

Narrative synthesis

Mortality

There were 21 observational studies reporting on mortality which evaluated the effect of beta-blockers vs. no beta-blocker use, in an overall population of 422,552 patients from at least 11 countries (Additional file 1: Table S2). According to inclusion criteria, 15 studies enrolled patients with COPD and a CVD indication, while the remaining six did not specify whether those with CVD were specifically excluded; however, all studies had varying percentages of CVD comorbidities. Overall, patient characteristics varied: mean age ranged between 62.8 and 84.6 years old and the proportion of males between and 37% and 100%. Distribution of comorbidities was mixed, with hypertension being the most widely reported and ranging between 27.5% and 88.3%. Smoking status was reported in seven studies where most patients were recorded as being either current or former smokers, however data was not available consistently. BMI was reported in five studies only, ranging between 20.4 and 29.9. Follow-up time was also highly variable, ranging from 2 to 112 months.

### Bisoprolol versus celiprolol on dynamic hyperinflation, cardiopulmonary exercise and domiciliary safety in COPD: a single-centre, randomised, crossover study [^9eb4d22b]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2023). High credibility.

It is reassuring that the doses of both bisoprolol and celiprolol used in the present study were not deleterious in any marker across cardiopulmonary exercise, resting visit or domiciliary outcomes, albeit in a small number of moderate-severe COPD subjects. The safety of beta-blocker use in obstructive airways disease has been of major concern for some time now. This is despite growing evidence of safety in retrospective studiesand indeed the potential for longer term benefit, mainly regarding the treatment of underlying overt or covert cardiovascular disease. The cardioselectivity of a beta-blocker as pertains to beta-1 over beta-2 adrenoceptor blockade is paramount when considering the safest long-term treatment in this context. Bisoprolol and celiprolol are both highly cardioselective in this regard. Pointedly, metoprolol is much less cardioselective than bisoprolol (2.3:1 vs 13.5:1, β1:β2). It is also short acting, given two times per day. However, metoprolol was used in the BLOCK COPD trial to assess for any protective effect on future exacerbation rate. There were safety concerns raised due to a higher rate of severe exacerbations in the treatment group but notably with no difference in overall hospitalisation or mortality. That study included a more severe group of patients with COPD than in the present one. They demonstrated a mean FEV 1 of 41%, with 40% of patients receiving supplemental oxygen and they were predominantly GOLD 3/4 status. Interestingly, 28% of those patients were not receiving LAMA treatment. There was no difference in their FEV 1 or 6 min walk distance over the course of the study, but the metoprolol group did display an increase in overall symptomatology versus the placebo group over time. Increasing COPD symptoms (GOLD status) are one of the key predictors of a future exacerbation, in addition to prior history of exacerbation. We did not find a change in domiciliary symptoms in the present study with either beta-blocker, which could allude to the development of this underlying safety concern in the longer term.

### Beta-blocker therapy in patients with COPD: a systematic literature review and meta-analysis with multiple treatment comparison [^2b961c4a]. Respiratory Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Results

The database search identified 2932 potentially relevant articles whilst other sources revealed six. After title and abstract screening, 187 articles underwent full-text review. We included 23 observational studies and 14 RCTs that reported on patients with COPD, in the systematic literature review. Out of a total of 23 observational studies, 21 reported on mortality, five reported on AECOPD three reported on all-cause hospitalization, one reported on SGRQ and one reported on SF-36. From a total of 14 RCTs, 12 reported on FEV1, two each reported on 12MWT and 6MWT and two reported on SGRQ (Fig. 1).

AECOPD

According to our protocol, we intended to include data on effect of beta-blockers on AECOPD from RCTs, however our search strategy revealed only one study of this kind. Based on a population of 532 patients with moderate to severe COPD, the authors reported no significant difference in time to first AECOPD (of any severity) between metoprolol and placebo, however the use of the beta-blocker was associated with a higher risk of severe exacerbation (requiring hospitalization). This study could not be included in the quantitative analysis, as there was no other RCT data to corroborate.

### Effect of beta blockers in treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a retrospective cohort study [^62e4fc82]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

The presence of cardiovascular disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are intertwined because of the risk of smoking induced atherosclerosis in patients with COPD. Despite the proved benefits of β blockers in treating hypertension, ischaemic heart disease, and heart failure, many doctors are reluctant to prescribe β blockers for patients with concurrent COPD.

Historically β blockers have been avoided in asthma because of the risk of acute bronchospasm. These concerns also apply to COPD, with evidence of a reduction in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1), increased airway hyperresponsiveness, and inhibition of bronchodilator response to β agonists in patients receiving non-selective β blockers and high doses of cardioselective β blockers.

Despite these concerns, evidence suggests that cardioselective β blockers do not cause an increase in exacerbations, reduction in airway function, or worsening of quality of life in COPD patients.COPD is a highly heterogeneous condition, and the degree of comorbidities present seems to be independent of the degree of airway obstruction. The treatment of comorbid cardiovascular disease in COPD is especially relevant since cardiac failure has been shown to be a leading cause of death in these patients.

In this regard, the use of β blockers in patients with COPD and cardiovascular disease has been shown to reduce mortality. Whether the improved survival seen with β blockers in COPD is purely due to cardiovascular effects has been questioned. Recent evidence suggests that β blockers may improve survival and exacerbations even in COPD patients without cardiovascular disease.

Although cardioselective β blockers have been designed to target β 1 adrenoceptors while avoiding β 2 adrenoceptors in the lung and elsewhere, so called cardioselective β blockers (such as atenolol and bisoprolol) are only relatively selective and exert significant β 2 antagonism at therapeutic doses, though to a lesser extent than non-selective β blockers such as propranolol. Thus, it might be considered counterintuitive to prescribe both β blockers and β agonists in the same patient, even when they are targeting different organs.

Current COPD management guidelines advocate a stepwise approach using long acting bronchodilators (including β agonists) and inhaled corticosteroids to reduce exacerbations and improve symptoms and lung function. With the exception of tiotropium, combination treatments involving long acting bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids have failed to show any significant improvement in mortality. We therefore wished to examine the use of β blockers in the management of COPD, assessing their interactions with β agonists and other COPD drug and assess whether they improve mortality, hospital admissions, and exacerbations when added to established treatment for COPD.

### Beta-blocker therapy in patients with COPD: a systematic literature review and meta-analysis with multiple treatment comparison [^c33d055c]. Respiratory Research (2021). Medium credibility.

COPD guidelines recommend the use of cardioselective beta-blockers when appropriate, reinforced by evidence gathered in a Cochrane review. Data regarding the association of beta-blocker therapy with mortality and acute exacerbations due to COPD (AECOPD) is derived mostly from observational data and previous reviews have aggregated results for cardio and non-cardioselective agents. However, a recent single RCT reported more hospitalizations due to AECOPD in patients treated with metoprolol as compared to placebo, though results on mortality and FEV1 were inconclusive.

Our study expands on previous literature by dissecting the effects of beta-blockers from both RCTs and observational studies, on a wide-range of clinically-relevant end points (mortality, AECOPD, FEV1, all-cause hospitalization and quality of life outcomes such as St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), 12 and 6MWT (12, 6 Minute Walking Test) and the Short-Form Health Survey Questionnaire (SF-36), thereby providing a comprehensive assessment of the effects of beta-blocker treatment in COPD. We have two overarching aims: (1) to identify and assess the class-effect of beta-blockers and (2) to compare within-class effects of beta-blockers on the aforementioned outcomes. If all studies have a minimum of one intervention in common with another, it will be possible to create a network of treatments, allowing both direct and indirect evidence to be used in deriving comparisons between beta-blockers not studied in a head-to-head manner, using a network-meta-analysis (NMA). Importantly, we also want to address a current gap in knowledge — we will investigate whether the potential benefits of beta-blockers are limited to those with CVD or may extend in the wider COPD population with or without undiagnosed CVD.

### Bisoprolol in patients with heart failure and moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a randomized controlled trial [^b1a28071]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2009). Low credibility.

Aims

Heart failure (HF) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) frequently coexist. No study has prospectively examined the effects of beta-blockade in those with both conditions.

Methods and Results

We randomized 27 patients with HF and coexistent moderate or severe COPD to receive bisoprolol or placebo, titrated to maximum tolerated dose over 4 months. The primary outcome was forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)). The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number: NCT00702156. Patients were elderly and predominantly male. Cardiovascular comorbidity, smoking history, and pulmonary function were similar in each group (mean FEV(1) 1.37 vs. 1.26 L, P = 0.52). A reduction in FEV(1) occurred after 4 months following treatment with bisoprolol compared with placebo (-70 vs. +120 mL, P = 0.01). Reversibility following inhaled beta(2)-agonist and static lung volumes were not impaired by bisoprolol. All measures of health status exhibited a consistent non-significant improvement, including the Short Form 36 physical and mental component scores (2.6 vs. 0.5 and 0.8 vs. -0.3, respectively), Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (-2.5 vs. 3.5) and Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire (0.07 vs. -0.24). The mean number of COPD exacerbations was similar in the bisoprolol and placebo groups (0.50 and 0.31, respectively, P = 0.44).

Conclusion

Initiation of bisoprolol in patients with HF and concomitant moderate or severe COPD resulted in a reduction in FEV(1). However, symptoms and quality of life were not impaired.

### Relationship between heart failure, concurrent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and β-blocker use: a Danish nationwide cohort study [^d11f2f06]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2018). Low credibility.

Aims

To compare the hazard of all-cause, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and heart failure (HF) hospitalization in carvedilol vs. metoprolol/bisoprolol/nebivolol users with COPD and concurrent HF from 2009 to 2012, and to evaluate the use and persistence in treatment of these β-blockers, their impact on the risk of COPD-related hospitalization, and the factors important for their selection.

Methods and Results

Cox and logistic regression were used for both unadjusted and adjusted analyses. Carvedilol users had a higher hazard of being hospitalized for HF compared with metoprolol/bisoprolol/nebivolol users in both the unadjusted [hazard ratio (HR) 1.74; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.65–1.83] and adjusted (HR 1.61; 95% CI 1.52–1.70) analyses. No significant differences were found for all-cause and COPD hospitalization between the two groups. Carvedilol users had a significant lower restricted mean persistence time than metoprolol/bisoprolol/nebivolol users. Patients exposed to carvedilol had an odds ratio (OR) of 1.38 (95% CI 1.23–1.56) for being hospitalized due to COPD within 60days after redeeming the first carvedilol prescription, which was similar to that observed in metoprolol/bisoprolol/nebivolol users (OR 1.37; 95% CI 1.27–1.48). Patients with concurrent chronic kidney disease had a higher probability of receiving carvedilol (OR 1.16; 95% CI 1.04–1.29).

Conclusion

Carvedilol prescription carried an increased hazard of HF hospitalization and lower restricted mean persistence time among patients with COPD and concurrent HF. Additionally, we found a widespread phenomenon of carvedilol prescription at variance with the European Society of Cardiology guidelines and potential for improving the proportion of patients treated with β-blockers.

### Tolerability of carvedilol in patients with heart failure and concomitant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma [^e9ce5227]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2002). Low credibility.

Background

A substantial proportion of the population with congestive heart failure (CHF) has concomitant airway disease. Little information exists on the tolerability of carvedilol in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In this study, we assessed the tolerability and efficacy of carvedilol in patients with CHF and concomitant COPD or asthma.

Methods

Between 1996 and 2000, a total of 487 patients began receiving open-label carvedilol. Forty-three (9%) had COPD (n = 31) or asthma (n = 12). Spirometry supported clinical diagnosis in all, and full pulmonary function testing supported diagnosis in 71%. Sixty percent began carvedilol therapy in the hospital and underwent measurement of peak expiratory flow rates (PEFR) before and after dosing.

Results

In patients with COPD, mean forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV(1)) was 62% ± 13% predicted, reversibility was 4% ± 4% with bronchodilators, and FEV(1)/FVC was 62% ± 8%. Mean PEFR was 325 ± 115 liter/min before the dose and increased by 17% 2 hours after the carvedilol dose (p = 0.04). In patients with asthma, mean FEV(1) was 80% ± 17% predicted, reversibility was 13% ± 7%, and FEV(1)/FVC was 74% ± 11%. Mean PEFR was 407 ± 161 liter/min before the dose with no significant change 2 hours after the dose. Carvedilol was introduced safely in 84% of patients with COPD, with only 1 patient withdrawn from therapy for wheezing. In contrast, only 50% of patients with asthma tolerated carvedilol. Survival at 2.5 years was 72%. In survivors, left ventricular end-diastolic diameter decreased from 76 ± 11 mm to 72 ± 14 mm (p = 0.01), left ventricular end-systolic diameter decreased from 65 ± 13 mm to 60 ± 15 mm (p = 0.01), and fractional shortening increased from 14% ± 7% to 17% ± 7% (p = 0.05) at 12 months.

Conclusions

Patients with CHF and COPD tolerated carvedilol well with no significant reversible airflow limitation, but patients with CHF and asthma tolerated carvedilol poorly. The effect of carvedilol on left ventricular dimensions and function in patients with concomitant airway diseases was similar to that seen in our general group of patients. Asthma remains a contraindication to beta-blockade.

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC

Incident cardiovascular disease is common in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), often requiring beta-blocker therapy. We compared the cardioselective beta-blockers bisoprolol and celiprolol, hypothesising the partial beta-2 agonist activity of celiprolol may provide greater protection against dynamic hyperinflation on cardiopulmonary exercise testing.

### Β-blockers and the rate of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations [^b835cb4f]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective: To review the rate of exacerbations relative to β-blocker use in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Data Sources: A MEDLINE search (1953 to May 2019) was performed using the search terms beta-blockers, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and exacerbations. An EMBASE search was also performed using the search terms chronic obstructive lung disease and beta adrenergic receptor blocking agents (1970 to May 2019). References from the review of literature citations were also identified. Study Selection and Data Extraction: English-language studies assessing COPD exacerbations in patients prescribed a β-blocker were included. Any article not addressing exacerbations was excluded. Data Synthesis: A total of 15 articles were included; 7 articles showed no change, 1 provided mixed results, and 7 indicated a significant decrease in COPD exacerbations in a variety of exacerbation severities. Two of the studies differentiated between cardioselective and noncardioselective β-blockers. Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice: This work represents an initial assessment of the use of β-blockers to reduce COPD exacerbations. The findings raise the question if β-blockers should be used more frequently in patients with COPD. Conclusions: Based on the limited number of studies that address β-blocker use in COPD, it appears that exacerbations are not increased and may be decreased. A randomized, placebo-controlled trial is in progress to possibly provide more definitive answers to this question. Until the trial is complete, β-blockers should not be withheld in COPD patients who have concurrent cardiovascular conditions, especially where there is a mortality benefit.

FEV1

Data from 12 RCTs evaluating FEV1 in 199 patients and seven beta-blockers (atenolol, bisoprolol, carvedilol, celiprolol, metoprolol, propranolol, labetalol) were evaluated. Duration of trials varied from 1 hour to 3–4 months and FEV1 measurement at baseline between 1.15 and 2.41 L [l]. Most patients were over 40 years old except for one study where mean age was 39. Across all studies, over 50% of the patient population were male and four studies only included patients with CVD or hypertension explicitly (Additional file 1: Table S5). A comparison between studies enrolling patients with CVD and those enrolling patients with COPD only is difficult due to scarcity of reported data. BMI was available in two studies of COPD and CVD and in one study only which excluded CVD. Estimates were however similar and denoted overweight, but not obese patient populations. Celiprolol was the only treatment which was evaluated in patients without CVD exclusively, in one trial only. Sample size, age and proportion of males were similar across all studies.

Methods

Search strategy

We searched the following databases to identify pertinent studies that examined the association between beta-blockers and all cause mortality: MEDLINE (1966 to March 2012), EMBASE (1980 to March 2012), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (1991 to March 2012), Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (1991 to March 2012), ACP Journal Club (1991 to March 2012), International Pharmaceutical Index (1970 to March 2012), BIOSIS Previews (1969 to March 2012) and Web of Science (1961 to March 2012). The initial search strategy was developed from the following MeSH subject headings COPD, Acebutolol, Atenolol, Betaxolol, Bisoprolol, Celiprolol, Esmolol, Metoprolol, Alprenolol, Bucindolol, Carteolol, Carvedilol, Labetalol, Nadolol, Penbutolol, Pindolol, Propranolol, Sotalol, Timolol, adrenergics, and Beta-blockers in MEDLINE. We reviewed titles for relevance from this search and examined all subject headings and abstracts. The scope notes in MEDLINE and EMBASE were also examined to ensure the correct subject headings were used based on their definitions; other subject headings were included based on previous indexing and the inclusion of keywords based on synonyms used in the scope notes. Proceedings and conference abstracts were searched through the databases PapersFirst (1993) and ProceedingsFirst (1993) up to March 2012. Authors' names and year of published work from key papers were entered into the cited reference search in the Web of Science. We screened the references of retrieved studies and review articles for any potentially missed articles. In addition, we hand searched the reference lists of retrieved studies as well as journals related to "pharmacology", "respirology", pulmonary", abstracts and books related to respiratory or lung diseases. There was no language restriction in selecting the studies.

Selection criteria

We considered all experimental or observational studies that assessed the association between beta-blocker use and mortality in COPD patients. Studies were included if they 1) clearly defined COPD as either primary or secondary outcomes; 2) clearly defined beta-blocker use as either a primary exposure in the study or used in a sub-group of patients with COPD; 3) presented relative risks or odds ratios (for all cause mortality) and their corresponding confidence intervals or provided enough data to compute these parameters.

### Beta-blocker therapy in patients with COPD: a systematic literature review and meta-analysis with multiple treatment comparison [^b87df5cc]. Respiratory Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This comprehensive and up-to-date evaluation of the effects of beta-blockers in patients with COPD adds to the previous literature in several ways: we included all studies reporting on any type of beta-blocker treatment in patients with COPD, showing overall beneficial effects on AECOPD and mortality. For the first time, we used a probabilistic approach to evaluate the effect of beta-blockers on FEV1 using direct and indirect evidence from RCTs in an NMA, comparing seven treatments against placebo, and presented results for patients with COPD with and without CVD disease separately. No beta-blocker affected lung function significantly except propranolol, and the treatments less likely to have a detrimental effect on FEV1 were labetalol (in those with COPD and CVD) and celiprolol (in those with COPD without explicit CVD). Lastly, we found that data on all-cause hospitalization and quality of life endpoints such as SGRQ, 12 and 6MWT and SF-36 were scarcely reported across the literature and did not lend themselves to formal quantitative analysis — suggesting an area of focus for future studies.

Mortality

Despite heterogeneous elements such as follow-up time, baseline characteristics including age, sex and comorbidities and geographical location, individual results from the 17 out of 21 studies reporting on mortality suggested beta-blocker therapy was associated with a diminished risk of death compared to those not prescribed beta-blockers, in patients with COPD. However, this quality of evidence was deemed "low" per GRADE assessment (Additional file 1: Table S17) and we were not able to quantify the effect of beta-blockers on mortality due to considerable heterogeneity (I² > 75%). Previous reports have provided pooled estimates of reductions in mortality risk associated with beta-blocker treatment, however all reported degrees of heterogeneity above the Cochrane I² threshold of 75%; 89.3%, 83% and most recently 96% bringing into question the validity and interpretability of these results as applied to the general COPD population. Reasons for very high heterogeneity in previous meta-analyses include: differences in study populations (i.e. including patients with differing degrees of severity), inaccurate risk of bias assessment and inclusion of different comparators for the intervention effect of interest (i.e. including studies where comparator arms received calcium channel blockers, despite aiming to assess the effect of beta-blocker treatment vs. lack of treatment).

Carvedilol

Several major trials have established the CV benefits of carvedilol over traditional non-vasodilating BBs in patients with HF. A meta-analysis of 19 placebo-controlled RCTs tested the efficacy of carvedilol versus metoprolol in terms of LVEF in patients with chronic HF. Carvedilol significantly increased LVEF when compared with metoprolol (placebo-corrected increases of +0.065 vs +0.038, p = 0.0002) as well as in the four active-controlled trials which directly compared carvedilol versus metoprolol (+0.084 vs +0.057, p = 0.009), and these benefits were derived in both patients with and without CHD.

A randomised trial of 51 patients with HF with a mean LVEF of 37% and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were treated with carvedilol, bisoprolol and metoprolol, and subsequently returned to their original BB treatment. N -terminal prohormone brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels, which are elevated in HF and have been shown to be a better predictor of major CV events than C reactive protein, were measured. Carvedilol reduced NT-proBNP levels significantly better than did either metoprolol or bisoprolol (mean NT-proBNP level were: 1001, 1371, 1349 ng/L, respectively (p < 0.01).

### Beta-blocker therapy in patients with COPD: a systematic literature review and meta-analysis with multiple treatment comparison [^cff39c43]. Respiratory Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Beta-blockers are associated with reduced mortality in patients with cardiovascular disease but are often under prescribed in those with concomitant COPD, due to concerns regarding respiratory side-effects. We investigated the effects of beta-blockers on outcomes in patients with COPD and explored within-class differences between different agents.

Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and Medline for observational studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the effects of beta-blocker exposure versus no exposure or placebo, in patients with COPD, with and without cardiovascular indications. A meta-analysis was performed to assess the association of beta-blocker therapy with acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD), and a network meta-analysis was conducted to investigate the effects of individual beta-blockers on FEV1. Mortality, all-cause hospitalization, and quality of life outcomes were narratively synthesized.

Results

We included 23 observational studies and 14 RCTs. In pooled observational data, beta-blocker therapy was associated with an overall reduced risk of AECOPD versus no therapy (HR 0.77, 95%CI 0.70 to 0.85). Among individual beta-blockers, only propranolol was associated with a relative reduction in FEV1 versus placebo, among 199 patients evaluated in RCTs. Narrative syntheses on mortality, all-cause hospitalization and quality of life outcomes indicated a high degree of heterogeneity in study design and patient characteristics but suggested no detrimental effects of beta-blocker therapy on these outcomes.

Conclusion

The class effect of beta-blockers remains generally positive in patients with COPD. Reduced rates of AECOPD, mortality, and improved quality of life were identified in observational studies, while propranolol was the only agent associated with a deterioration of lung function in RCTs.

### Beta-blocker therapy in patients with COPD: a systematic literature review and meta-analysis with multiple treatment comparison [^2b6b03e6]. Respiratory Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Overall, our FEV1 analysis suggests the beta-blockers included in this review do not affect lung function in patients with COPD regardless of CVD disease status, and selectivity of agent does not appear to have an impact. However, the two treatment networks contained different medications (celiprolol was assessed in one trial excluding CVD, while labetalol in one trial including CVD) thus we cannot rule out any other potential differential results if a whole range of beta-blockers were included. Finally, we included evidence based on a relatively small population and some of the studies were conducted decades ago; therefore, large clinical studies are needed to assess other agents which may confer lung function benefits across contemporary COPD patients.

The effect of beta-blocker exposure on all-cause hospitalization and quality of life outcomes in patients with COPD could not be quantified, due to a paucity of data. Narrative results from the assessment of studies investigating quality of life outcomes, such as SGRQ, 12 and 6 MWT and SF-36 all suggest non-significant effect of beta-blockers, from both RCTs and observational studies, albeit the data was deemed to be of "very low" quality according to GRADE (Additional file 1: Table S17). Currently, COPD management is focused on preventing exacerbations and improving functioning and health-related quality of life. Clinical studies of beta-blocker treatment in cardiac disease suggests improvements in exercise tolerance and functional status, so whether beta-blockers impair or improve these outcomes in patients with COPD also, is a topic of importance for clinical management. Both randomized trials and, importantly, prospective observational studies with longer follow-up times are needed.

### Beta-blocker therapy in patients with COPD: a systematic literature review and meta-analysis with multiple treatment comparison [^0972b3fe]. Respiratory Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Whilst CVD is diagnosed in 20 to 60% patients with COPD, our main analysis included primarily small trials and only three explicitly included patients with a cardiac comorbidity (one included angina, two included HF patients, and one included patients with hypertension, which is a common CVD risk factor. In line with previous research, we report no significant FEV1 treatment effect in patients with COPD with CVD.

The remaining eight trials excluded those with CVD (or simply did not report whether this was present), and results mirrored those observed for patients with CVD. Whilst results from this subgroup analysis are encouraging, previous clinical data on in this subgroup is scarce. A recent single RCT including COPD patients without an indication for beta-blockers (therefore those with HF, previous MI or revascularization) failed to demonstrate clear benefits of metoprolol over placebo. Observational studies have included a more varied breadth of specific beta-blockers, however they do not present a clear picture: the population-based Rotterdam Study reported significant decreases in FEV1 associated with both cardio and non-cardioselective beta-blockers, while two other studies, one from Scotland and an one from Japan reported no significant difference in FEV1. Yet, these results may be affected by confounding by indication, which may explain the variability of estimates. Additionally, the longer follow-up times in these studies (ranging from 4 to 6 years) may overlook effects of FEV1 decline which is documented in patients with COPD, regardless of CVD comorbidities.

### Effect of β-blockers on exacerbation rate and lung function in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [^d2e7c34f]. Respiratory Research (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a progressive and debilitating disease that burdens the healthcare system with frequent office visits and hospitalizations. In recent years, studies have examined both traditional treatments for COPD (long acting beta agonists, long acting muscarinic antagonists, and inhaled corticosteroids) as well as drugs usually reserved for cardiovascular disease or infection (statins and azithromycin) with respect to their efficacy in reducing acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD).

Beta-blockers are regularly prescribed in patients with cardiovascular disease, a common comorbidity in patients with COPD. Providers have historically been reluctant to treat COPD patients with beta-blockers due to a concern for precipitating bronchospasm. These concerns have been expressed in review articles and practice guidelines that cited case studies of acute bronchospasm in patients treated with non-selective beta blockers. Cardioselective beta-blockers (or beta-1-blockers) have a 20 fold greater affinity for β-1 receptors and less theoretical risk for bronchoconstriction. Within the last decade, studies have highlighted concern for the use of beta-blockers in patients with COPD; however, Cochrane Reviews in 2005 and 2010 concluded that cardioselective beta blocker use in patients with COPD had no significant adverse effects on FEV 1, respiratory symptoms, or responsiveness to beta-agonist inhaled therapy. Sub-group analysis extended this to patients with severe obstruction as well as those with bronchodilator reversibility demonstrated on spirometry.

### Association of β-blocker use with survival and pulmonary function in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary and cardiovascular disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^040770f0]. European Heart Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we investigated the effect of BBs on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease from multiple perspectives. This meta-analysis summarized and compared 49 studies involving 670 594 patients.

BBs do not lead to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease

Our meta-analysis of respiratory function indicators suggested that BBs did reduce ventilation function when used alone, but when used in combination with bronchodilator, cardioselective BBs did not reduce the respiratory indices or impair the effects of bronchodilators. This is probably due to the distribution of different β-adrenergic receptors (β-ARs).

We also found that BBs did not worsen chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and even suggested that cardioselective BBs are beneficial for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) involving 532 subjects with moderate and severe chronic obstructive pulmonary diseaseshowed no difference in the risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation between the metoprolol and placebo groups. The majority of previous studies was observational trials; nevertheless, this RCT suggested that the use of BBs did not exacerbate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which was similar to our finding.

### Cardioselective β-blockers for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^238b91fa]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Beta-blocker therapy has a proven mortality benefit in patients with hypertension, heart failure and coronary artery disease, as well as during the perioperative period. These drugs have traditionally been considered contraindicated in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Objectives

To assess the effect of cardioselective beta-blockers on respiratory function of patients with COPD.

Search Strategy

A comprehensive search of the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register (derived from systematic searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL) was carried out to identify randomised blinded controlled trials from 1966 to May 2005. We did not exclude trials on the basis of language.

Selection Criteria

Randomised, blinded, controlled trials of single dose or longer duration that studied the effects of cardioselective beta-blockers on the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) or symptoms in patients with COPD.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two independent reviewers extracted data from the selected articles, reconciling differences by consensus. Two interventions studied were the administration of beta-blocker, given either as a single dose or for longer duration, and the use of beta2-agonist given after the study drug.

Main Results

Eleven studies of single-dose treatment and 9 of treatment for longer durations, ranging from 2 days to 12 weeks, met selection criteria. Cardioselective beta-blockers, given as a single dose or for longer duration, produced no change in FEV1 or respiratory symptoms compared to placebo, and did not affect the FEV1 treatment response to beta2-agonists. A subgroup analysis revealed no change in results for those participants with severe chronic airways obstruction or for those with a reversible obstructive component.

Authors' Conclusions

Cardioselective beta-blockers, given to patients with COPD in the identified studies did not produce adverse respiratory effects. Given their demonstrated benefit in conditions such as heart failure, coronary artery disease and hypertension, cardioselective beta-blockers should not be routinely withheld from patients with COPD.

### Commentary on the carvedilol or metoprolol European trial (COMET) [^4e137b54]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

beta-Adrenergic blockade is commonly and successfully used to treat chronic heart failure. Until recently, few data were available on which to base selection of a particular beta-blocking agent. The Carvedilol or Metoprolol European Trial (COMET) provides evidence that beta-blockers are not interchangeable. The trial compared carvedilol, a nonselective beta-blocker with alpha-adrenergic blocking and numerous ancillary activities, with metoprolol tartrate. In comparison to metoprolol tartrate, significant reductions in all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality were observed with carvedilol. These data indicate that cardiovascular benefit may be obtained from switching patients from metoprolol tartrate to carvedilol.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^465eba36]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Other drugs with potential to reduce exacerbations in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are summarized as follows: Four large phase 3 studies of the anti-IL-5 monoclonal antibody mepolizumab and the anti-IL-5 receptor-α antibody benralizumab in patients with COPD who had a history of two or more exacerbations in the last year and increased blood eosinophil count showed inconsistent effects on exacerbation reduction and none have received regulatory approval, and large randomized trials are been conducted to investigate whether these and other biologic treatments are effective in a population who have more compelling evidence of eosinophilic or type II airway inflammation. In two large, phase 3, double-blind, randomized trials, patients with COPD, chronic bronchitis, a history of two or more moderate exacerbations or one or more severe exacerbation(s) in the last year despite LABA+LAMA+ICS, and blood eosinophil count of ≥ 300 cells/μL who received dupilumab had fewer exacerbations, better lung function and improved health status over 52 weeks. Nedocromil and leukotriene modifiers have not been tested adequately in COPD patients and the available evidence does not support their use. There was no evidence of benefit, and some evidence of harm, including malignancy and pneumonia, following treatment with an anti-TNF-alpha antibody (infliximab) in moderate to severe COPD. A recent Cochrane meta-analysis did not show sufficient evidence to support the use of immunostimulants. An RCT of the selective β1 receptor blocker metoprolol in patients with moderate or severe COPD without an established indication showed it did not delay the time until the first COPD exacerbation compared to placebo and hospitalization for exacerbation was more common; there is no evidence that beta-blockers should be used in people with COPD who do not have a cardiovascular indication for their use. Simvastatin did not prevent exacerbations in people with COPD who had no metabolic or cardiovascular indication for statin treatment, and an association between statin use and improved outcomes (including decreased exacerbations and mortality) has been reported in observational studies of people with COPD who received them for cardiovascular and metabolic indications.

Results

Baseline demographics and characteristics

Of the 3589 patients included in this analysis, 1269 (35.4%) were beta-blocker users and 2320 (64.6%) were non-users at baseline. Baseline characteristics were generally similar between groups (Table 1); however, a greater proportion of beta-blocker users were male (64.4% vs 55.5%) and had one or more prior CV event (67.9% vs 36.7%) than non-users. Baseline COPD characteristics were similar between beta-blocker users and non-users in terms of post-bronchodilator FEV 1 (mean % predicted, standard deviation [SD] 47.2 [14.2] vs 48.0 [15.4]), pre-bronchodilator FEV 1 (mean [SD] 1215 mL [486] vs 1213 mL [492]), the percentage of patients experiencing exacerbations (60.5% vs 59.8%), and the exacerbation rate in the prior year (mean [SD] 0.8 [0.9] vs 0.8 [1.0]). Of note, concomitant use of LABA therapies, which were started after the first study dose, was similar between beta-blocker users compared with non-users (eg, LABA/ICS: 10.5% vs 9.6%; LABA monotherapy: 0.6% vs 0.6%, respectively). Cardio-selective beta-blocker use was more common than non-selective beta-blocker use (69.9% vs 30.7% of patients respectively); of note, up to 11 patients took multiple beta-blockers (Table 2). Metoprolol was the most common beta-blocker used (49.4%).

### Influence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on long-term hospitalization and mortality in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction [^d272ac91]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Beta-blockers is the one of the GDMT for HFrEF. Current GOLD guideline suggested cardioselective beta-blockers use in COPD patients who comorbid with HF. However, there are still evidence that beta-blockers may have negative impact on patients with COPD. The BLOCK-COPD trial showed hospitalization for exacerbation was more common in metoprolol than placebo group in patient with moderate or severe COPD. Higuchi et al. reported the use of beta-blockers were associated with lower all-cause mortality due to lower non-cardiac mortality in patients with HF and COPD. Overall, the benefit of beta-blockers seems to overweigh the potential harm.

The baseline low-prescription rate of beta-blockers is observed in our study, relatively lower than previous studies. Some of the patients in our study was newly diagnosed of HFrEF during the hospitalization. Most of them had hypertension only before diagnosis, and ACEI/ARB instead of beta-blockers are the initiating agents for hypertension. Also, we retrospectively recruit hospitalized HFrEF patient in 2013–2015. Whether to prescribe beta-blockers in patients with HFrEF and COPD is still in debated at that time. So, the low-prescription rate in beta-blockers could be seen under these clinical settings.

### Beta-blocker use and COPD mortality: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^70e36cc9]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

The mortality benefits of beta-blockers in COPD are thought to be due to the cardioprotective effect of the drugs. Two other postulated mechanisms may also explain the potential benefits of beta-blockers in COPD. Increased beta-agonist activity has shown to play an important role in the pathology of CHF. Thus patients taking beta-blockers with concomitant COPD and CHF may experience a lower degree of beta agonist stimulation.

Finally, it is yet unclear as to whether a protective effect with these drugs is a class-effect or whether this benefit differs with the receptor selectivity (B 1 selective vs non-selective such as carvedilol). Carvedilol has shown to have pleiotropic properties including antioxidant exerting effects and has shown to lower mortality in patients with CHF. Thus, carvediolol's mortality reduction in COPD patients may be more profound than that of beta-selective beta-blockers. It is possible that the beneficial effects of beta-blockers go beyond their cardioprotective properties. Heindl et al. examined the sympathetic nerve activity in six COPD patients with no previous history of coronary artery disease and six healthy controls. COPD subjects showed a significantly higher peripheral sympathetic activity than the controls. Rutten et al. assessed the effect of beta-blockers in a sub-group of COPD patients with less severe coronary artery disease. The relative risk of mortality amongst COPD patients who used beta-blockers and only had hypertension was similar to those with more severe form of coronary artery disease (RR = 0.67, 95% CI: 0.45–0.99: RR = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.56–0.83 respectively).

This review, as with all systematic reviews of observational studies, has limitations. None of the studies were randomised trials and although statistical adjustment was used in all the studies to control for potential confounders, not all confounding variables could have been adjusted in some of the studies. Information on beta-blocker use was also incomplete in most of the studies and did not provide information on the patterns of exposure including, adherence or a dose–response relation for beta-blockers in their relation to COPD mortality. Moreover, many of the studies did not describe in detail how mortality data was obtained. Finally, several types of biases specific to pharmacoepidemiologic studies of respiratory disease may have potentially affected the results of the studies included in this review. We briefly discuss four types of biases including immortal time bias, immeasurable time bias, calendar time bias and confounding by contraindication.

### Β-blocker use and clinical outcomes in patients with COPD following acute myocardial infarction [^81ac2ab7]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

While β-blockers are associated with decreased mortality in cardiovascular disease (CVD), exacerbation-prone patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who received metoprolol in the Beta-Blockers for the Prevention of Acute Exacerbations of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (BLOCK-COPD) trial experienced increased risk of exacerbations requiring hospitalization. However, the study excluded individuals with established indications for the drug, raising questions about the overall risk and benefit in patients with COPD following acute myocardial infarction (AMI).

Objective

To investigate whether β-blocker prescription at hospital discharge is associated with increased risk of mortality or adverse cardiopulmonary outcomes in patients with COPD and AMI.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This prospective, longitudinal cohort study with 6 months of follow-up enrolled patients aged 35 years or older with COPD who underwent cardiac catheterization for AMI at 18 BLOCK-COPD network hospitals in the US from June 2020 through May 2022.

Exposure

Prescription for any β-blocker at hospital discharge.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was time to the composite outcome of death or all-cause hospitalization or revascularization. Secondary outcomes included death, hospitalization, or revascularization for CVD events, death or hospitalization for COPD or respiratory events, and treatment for COPD exacerbations.

Results

Among 3531 patients who underwent cardiac catheterization for AMI, prevalence of COPD was 17.1% (95% CI, 15.8%-18.4%). Of 579 total patients with COPD and AMI, 502 (86.7%) were prescribed a β-blocker at discharge. Among the 562 patients with COPD included in the final analysis, median age was 70.0 years (range, 38.0–94.0 years) and 329 (58.5%) were male; 553 of the 579 patients (95.5%) had follow-up information. Among those discharged with β-blockers, there was no increased risk of the primary end point of all-cause mortality, revascularization, or hospitalization (hazard ratio [HR], 1.01; 95% CI, 0.66–1.54; P = 0.96) or of cardiovascular events (HR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.65–1.92; P = 0.69), COPD-related or respiratory events (HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.34–1.66; P = 0.48), or treatment for COPD exacerbations (rate ratio, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.53–1.91; P = 0.98).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cohort study, β-blocker prescription at hospital discharge was not associated with increased risk of adverse outcomes in patients with COPD and AMI. These findings support use of β-blockers in patients with COPD and recent AMI.

### Long-acting antimuscarinic therapy in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease receiving β-blockers [^7a17168c]. Respiratory Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Beta-blocker therapies for cardiovascular comorbidities are often withheld in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) due to potential adverse effects on airway obstruction. We carried out a post hoc analysis to determine the efficacy and safety of aclidinium in patients with moderate-to-very severe COPD and increased cardiovascular risk receiving beta-blockers at baseline versus non-users.

Methods

ASCENT-COPD was a Phase 4, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. Patients were randomized 1:1 to aclidinium or placebo twice-daily for up to 3 years. Outcomes included risk of (time to first) major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), all-cause mortality, and lung function over 3 years, and exacerbations over 1 year.

Results

Of 3589 patients, 1269 (35.4%) used beta-blockers and 2320 (64.6%) were non-users at baseline. Aclidinium did not statistically increase the risk of MACE (beta-blocker user: hazard ratio 1.01 [95% CI 0.62–1.64]; non-user: 0.80 [0.51–1.24]; interaction P = 0.48) or all-cause mortality (beta-blocker user: 1.13 [0.78–1.64]; non-user: 0.89 [0.62–1.26]; interaction P = 0.35), in patients using beta-blockers. Aclidinium reduced annualized rate of moderate-to-severe COPD exacerbation (beta-blocker user: rate ratio 0.75 [95% CI 0.60–0.94, P = 0.013]; non-user: 0.79 [0.67–0.93, P = 0.005]), delayed time to first exacerbation, and improved lung function versus placebo. There was greater trough FEV 1 benefit in beta-blocker users versus non-users (least squares mean difference at 52 weeks: 111 mL [95% CI 74 mL–147 mL] versus 69 mL [42 mL–97 mL]; interaction P = 0.041).

Conclusions

This post hoc analysis supports long-acting anti-muscarinic use with concomitant beta-blockers in patients with moderate-to-very severe COPD and cardiovascular comorbidity.

Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01966107, Registered 16 October 2013.

### Underuse of β-blockers in heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^889cc159]. Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the world's leading causes of morbidity and mortality. Cardiovascular comorbidity is common in patients with COPD, at least partly due to the common risk factor of cigarette smoking. The prevalence of COPD in patients with heart failure (HF) ranges from 11%–52% to 9%–41% in North American and European patients, respectively. There is a need to evaluate the drugs used in the treatment of common comorbidities in COPD, in particular the putative effects of β-blockers on the cardiovascular burden and its associated impact on mortalityβ-blockers are established in HF management guidelines, which reinforce their use in patients with concomitant COPD. However, aside from the use of long-term oxygen therapy, there are no respiratory drugs that have been shown to have a significant impact on mortality in COPD.

COPD management guidelines also state that the benefits of selective β-1 antagonists in HF outweigh potential risks, even in patients with severe COPD. Because of concerns regarding potential bronchoconstriction (especially in patients with more severe COPD), primary and secondary care physicians remain somewhat reticent to prescribe β-blockers in COPD. In a retrospective study of 1603 patients with COPD and a history of myocardial infarction (MI), 22% were prescribed a beta -blocker on admission to hospital and 55% of patients were not prescribed one β-blocker.

Initiating treatment with β-blockers in HF and COPD is not simple. It requires careful initial dose titration over a period of weeks, along with monitoring of heart rate, supine and standing blood pressure and spirometry. Moreover, β-blockers tend to be less well tolerated in older patients with comorbidities, such as diabetes, peripheral vascular disease and renal impairment, who are more prone to postural hypotension. This may further compound the reluctance to prescribe β-blockers in HF and COPD, especially in a busy outpatient setting.

### Association of β-blocker use with survival and pulmonary function in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary and cardiovascular disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^c89dc95b]. European Heart Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Results

Study selection and characteristics

The initial search in four databases yielded 2059 publications. Finally, a total of 49 studies, with a combined sample of 670 594 subjects, were summarized and compared in this meta-analysis (see Figure 1). Among the included studies, 37 were cohort studies used to assess the HR of survival between patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease treated with BBs and those not treated with BBs. Almost all used various BBs daily, which included cardioselective BBs that primarily antagonize the β1 receptor, including metoprolol, bisoprolol, atenolol, and nebivolol, and noncardioselective BBs that antagonize the β1 and β2 receptors, including carvedilol, labetalol, pindolol, propranolol, nadolol, and timolol. Among these, four studies focused on comparisons between cardioselective and noncardioselective BB users, and 33 focused on comparisons between BB and no BB users (BBs refer to cardioselective or noncardioselective BBs or both) (Supplementary material online, Table S1).

Take home figure
Each line represents a combined result. Line one shows that the hazard ratios of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation are 0.77 (95% confidence interval [0.67–0.89]) between patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease + cardiovascular disease who are treated with β-blockers and those who are not treated with β-blockers. A total of 17 studies, including 183 685 samples, are included in this comparison. The other results can be deduced by analogy. BBs, β-blockers; CI, confidence interval; CVD, cardiovascular disease.

Risk of bias within studies

All 37 cohort or case–control studies had good overall quality. Their sample sizes were sufficiently large and basically represented the average state of the community population. Almost all studies identified and controlled important confounding factors. A few studies had insufficient follow-up durations. The NOS scores are shown in the Supplementary material online, Table S2.

### Beta-blocker use and COPD mortality: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^81dbac0e]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Despite the benefits of beta-blockers in patients with established or sub-clinical coronary artery disease, their use in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has been controversial. Currently, no systematic review has examined the impact of beta-blockers on mortality in COPD.

Methods

We systematically searched electronic bibliographic databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Library for clinical studies that examine the association between beta-blocker use and all cause mortality in patients with COPD. Risk ratios across studies were pooled using random effects models to estimate a pooled relative risk across studies. Publication bias was assessed using a funnel plot.

Results

Our search identified nine retrospective cohort studies that met the study inclusion criteria. The pooled relative risk of COPD related mortality secondary to beta-blocker use was 0.69 (95% CI: 0.62–0.78; I² = 82%).

Conclusion

The results of this review are consistent with a protective effect of beta-blockers with respect to all cause mortality. Due to the observational nature of the included studies, the possibility of confounding that may have affected these results cannot be excluded. The hypothesis that beta blocker therapy might be of benefit in COPD needs to be evaluated in randomised controlled trials.

### Bisoprolol versus celiprolol on dynamic hyperinflation, cardiopulmonary exercise and domiciliary safety in COPD: a single-centre, randomised, crossover study [^d45cd56c]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2023). High credibility.

Background

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is frequently associated with cardiovascular disease. The utility of beta-blockers for treating patients with COPD may be beneficial, but their safety remains uncertain, including worsening of dynamic hyperinflation (DH) during exercise. We hypothesised that among cardioselective beta-blockers celiprolol, due to its partial beta-2 agonist activity, may be safer than bisoprolol on exercise DH.

Methods

We measured isotime inspiratory capacity (IC) during cycle endurance testing in eleven moderate-severe COPD subjects, alongside other non-invasive cardiopulmonary exercise, bioreactance cardiac output, pulmonary function, biomarkers and daily domiciliary measures. Participants received titrated doses of either bisoprolol (maximim 5 mg) or celiprolol (maximum 400 mg) in randomised crossover fashion, each over 4 weeks.

Results

Clinically relevant DH occurred between resting and exercise isotime IC but showed no significant difference with either beta-blocker compared with post-run-in pooled baseline or between treatments. There were no other significant differences observed for remaining exercise ventilatory; non-invasive cardiac output; resting pulmonary function; beta-2 receptor and cardiac biomarkers; domiciliary pulmonary function, oxygen saturation and symptom outcomes, either between treatments or compared with baseline. No significant adverse effects occurred.

Conclusions

Significant DH in moderate-severe COPD subjects was no different between bisoprolol or celiprolol or versus baseline. A broad spectrum of other non-invasive cardiopulmonary and domiciliary safety outcomes was equally reassuring. Bronchoprotection with a concomitant long-acting muscarinic antagonist might be an important safety measure in this context.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease comorbidity management — patients with COPD and multiple chronic comorbidities are generally treated according to existing standards for each disease, and observational studies suggest mortality can be reduced by nonrespiratory treatments including β-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and statins. We recommend: Studies that evaluate the effects of treating COPD on the outcomes of comorbid diseases as well as studies that evaluate the effect of treating comorbid diseases on COPD-related outcomes.

### Cardioselective β-blockers for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a meta-analysis [^dab252d4]. Respiratory Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Beta-blocker therapy has a mortality benefit in patients with hypertension, heart failure and coronary artery disease, as well as during the perioperative period. These drugs have traditionally been considered contraindicated in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The objective of this study was to assess the effect of cardioselective beta-blockers on respiratory function of patients with COPD. Comprehensive searches were performed of the EMBASE, MEDLINE and CINAHL databases from 1966 to May 2001, and identified articles and related reviews were scanned. Randomised, blinded, controlled trials that studied the effects of cardioselective beta-blockers on the forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) or symptoms in patients with COPD were included in the analysis. Interventions studied were the administration of beta-blocker, given either as a single dose or for longer duration, and the use of beta2-agonist given after the study drug. Outcomes measured were the change in FEV1 from baseline and the number of patients with respiratory symptoms. Eleven studies of single-dose treatment and 8 of continued treatment were included. Cardioselective beta-blockers produced no significant change in FEV1 or respiratory symptoms compared to placebo, given as a single dose (-2.05% [95% CI, -6.05% to 1.96%]) or for longer duration (-2.55% [CI, -5.94% to 0.84]), and did not significantly affect the FEV1 treatment response to beta2-agonists. Subgroup analyses revealed no significant change in results for those participants with severe chronic airways obstruction or for those with a reversible obstructive component. In conclusion, cardioselective beta-blockers given to patients with COPD do not produce a significant reduction in airway function or increase the incidence of COPD exacerbations. Given their demonstrated benefit in conditions such as heart failure, coronary artery disease and hypertension, cardioselective beta-blockers should be considered for patients with COPD.

### Bisoprolol versus celiprolol on dynamic hyperinflation, cardiopulmonary exercise and domiciliary safety in COPD: a single-centre, randomised, crossover study [^0809a7f5]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2023). High credibility.

The strengths of the present study included detailed cardiopulmonary physiological testing at rest and during exercise in moderate-severe COPD patients who demonstrated DH, which gave us an optimal phenotypical group in which we might uncover early detrimental cardiopulmonary effects of beta-blockade in addition to studying our hypothesised primary outcome. Furthermore, our inclusion of daily domiciliary safety measurements also proved reassuring. This study was adequately powered for the primary outcome using a crossover design to achieve this, which serendipitously helped to minimise participant exposure to beta-blocker treatment while safety concerns remain. Moreover, careful dose titration using highly cardioselective beta-blockers additionally improved our risk/benefit ratio. The limitations of the study included the short study duration, thus precluding information on exacerbations, a limited number of participants reducing the likelihood of picking up idiosyncratic beta-blocker adverse effects as well as the inability to study more severe COPD patients due to their very limited exercise capacity already, and potential for needing supplemental oxygen therapy. However, the optimal timing of potentially beneficial long-term beta-blocker treatment (early vs late) as COPD progresses is not yet known.

In conclusion, the observed clinically significant DH in moderate-severe COPD subjects was no different between chronic dosing of bisoprolol or celiprolol or versus baseline during cycle endurance testing. The broad spectrum of other cardiopulmonary and domiciliary safety outcomes was equally reassuring both between treatments and versus baseline. Further long-term studies using highly cardioselective beta-blockers for either preventing comorbid cardiovascular disease in COPD, or indeed treating COPD itself, are urgently needed.

### Effect of β-blockers on exacerbation rate and lung function in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [^9f05b2b4]. Respiratory Research (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Beta-blockers are commonly prescribed for patients with cardiovascular disease. Providers have been wary of treating chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients with beta-blockers due to concern for bronchospasm, but retrospective studies have shown that cardio-selective beta-blockers are safe in COPD and possibly beneficial. However, these benefits may reflect symptom improvements due to the cardiac effects of the medication. The purpose of this study is to evaluate associations between beta-blocker use and both exacerbation rates and longitudinal measures of lung function in two well-characterized COPD cohorts.

Methods

We retrospectively analyzed 1219 participants with over 180 days of follow up from the STATCOPE trial, which excluded most cardiac comorbidities, and from the placebo arm of the MACRO trial. Primary endpoints were exacerbation rates per person-year and change in spirometry over time in association with beta blocker use.

Results

Overall 13.9% (170/1219) of participants reported taking beta-blockers at enrollment. We found no statistically significant differences in exacerbation rates with respect to beta-blocker use regardless of the prevalence of cardiac comorbidities. In the MACRO cohort, patients taking beta-blockers had an exacerbation rate of 1.72/person-year versus a rate of 1.71/person-year in patients not taking beta-blockers. In the STATCOPE cohort, patients taking beta-blockers had an exacerbation rate of 1.14/person-year. Patients without beta-blockers had an exacerbation rate of 1.34/person-year. We found no detrimental effect of beta blockers with respect to change in lung function over time.

Conclusion

We found no evidence that beta-blocker use was unsafe or associated with worse pulmonary outcomes in study participants with moderate to severe COPD.

Results

A total of 89 861 patients being treated for COPD, 24 237 with HF and 10 853 with both HF and COPD were identified. In patients who had HF and COPD, mean (SD) age was 79 (9) years; 60% were males, 27% had a prior MI and 32% had an asthma diagnosis. In those with HF alone, corresponding figures were 78 (12) years, 53% males, 30% prior MI and 26% asthma diagnosis. The median (IQR) of the study period for patients with HF and COPD was 2010 (2005–2013) and for patients with HF only was 2012 (2009–2014). Comparing patients with HF versus HF and COPD, respective mean (SD) values for BMI were 29 (6) versus 28 (6), and for FEV 1% of predicted were 78% versus 57%.

Data for COPD severity grading in patients with HF and COPD comprised GOLD stage A (21%), B (25%), C (19%) and D (35%). Grading according to NYHA showed: 38% class 1, 26% class 2, 27% class 3 and 10% class 4 in patients with HF and COPD, with the corresponding figures in HF alone being 54%, 26%, 15% and 5%.

Of those taking β-blockers (irrespective of ACEI and ARB use; n = 24 566), there were 21 926 (89%) patients who were receiving cardioselective β-blockers, the most common being bisoprolol (77%) and atenolol (16%), and 2640 (11%) receiving non-selective β-blockers, the most common being carvedilol (45%).

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with cardiovascular comorbidity — clinical challenges and care gaps are described, noting that comorbidity "might alter clinicians' risk:benefit ratio to provide evidence-based care for the first condition", such that patients with COPD and heart failure "might not be given β-blockers" despite an indication, even though "the absolute risk with cardioselective (B1) β-blockers is inconsequential". At the population level, not receiving guideline-concordant heart failure care "likely contributes to excess deaths and represents a translation gap". Diagnostic overlap makes it "challenging to differentiate COPD from cardiovascular disease", and without thorough evaluation patients may receive bronchodilators, nebulizers, and antibiotics when the actual etiology is "heart failure and/or arrhythmias" or "pulmonary vascular congestion".

### Meta-analysis of the effects of carvedilol versus metoprolol on all-cause mortality and hospitalizations in patients with heart failure [^0e6de128]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Long-term treatment with appropriate doses of carvedilol or metoprolol is currently recommended for patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) to decrease the risk of death, hospitalizations, and patients' symptoms. It remains unclear if the β blockers used in patients with HFrEF are equal or carvedilol is superior to metoprolol types. We performed a meta-analysis of the comparative effects of carvedilol versus metoprolol tartrate and succinate on all-cause mortality and/or hospitalization. We conducted an Embase and MEDLINE search for prospective controlled trials and cohort studies of patients with HFrEF who were received to treatment with carvedilol versus metoprolol. We identified 4 prospective controlled and 6 cohort studies with 30,943 patients who received carvedilol and 69,925 patients on metoprolol types (tartrate and succinate) with an average follow-up duration of 36.4 months. All-cause mortality was reduced in prospective studies with carvedilol versus metoprolol tartrate. Neither all-cause mortality nor hospitalizations were significantly different between carvedilol and metoprolol succinate in the cohort studies. In conclusion, in patients with HFrEF, carvedilol and metoprolol succinate have similar effects in reducing all-cause mortality.

### Beta-blockers in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and concomitant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: cardiovascular and respiratory outcomes [^52010a12]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

Patients with heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are poorly represented in HFrEF trials testing beta-blockers. We assessed cardiovascular effectiveness and respiratory safety of beta-blockers in these patients.

Methods and Results

Patients with HFrEF and COPD in the Swedish HF Registry (2006–2023) were included. Overlap-weighted models were used to assess associations between beta-blocker use and 5-year risk of outcomes, with cardiovascular death/total hospitalizations for HF (HHF) representing the primary cardiovascular effectiveness outcome, and total severe COPD exacerbations being the primary respiratory safety outcome. Of 5084 patients with HFrEF and COPD, median age was 75years (interquartile range [IQR] 69–81), 68.3% were male, 36.9% were in GOLD group E, 91.5% used beta-blockers. Over a median follow-up of 2.5years (IQR 1.0–4.8), beta-blocker users had lower crude risk of cardiovascular death/total HHF (rate ratio [RR] 0.66, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.56–0.78) and total severe COPD exacerbations (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.60–0.93). After overlap weighting, beta-blocker use was independently associated with lower risk of cardiovascular death/total HHF (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.58–0.96) but not total severe COPD exacerbations (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.73–1.35). These associations were consistent across subgroups (including GOLD groups), except for the greater magnitude of the association with lower risk of cardiovascular death/total HHF in patients with left ventricular ejection fraction < 30% (p for interaction = 0.004). Falsification analyses suggested no influence from residual confounding.

Conclusions

In patients with HFrEF and COPD, beta-blocker use was associated with lower risk of cardiovascular death/total HHF, without evidence of safety concerns for COPD exacerbations.

Role of beta-blockers in patients of COPD with coexistent cardiovascular disease

Physicians often avoid using β-blockers in patients with COPD due to concerns of adverse bronchospasm. However, a systematic review of randomized, controlled trials reported that β-blockers do not increase respiratory symptoms, reduce lung function or reduce response to inhaled β 2 -agonists.

An observational study from 23 practices in Netherlands (N = 2230 COPD patients) reported that β-blockers reduced total mortality by 30% (14–41%) and ECOPD by 27% (17–37%). A subsequent systematic review of 15 studies reported that β-blockers reduce mortality by 28% (17–37%) and reduce ECOPD by 37% (29–43%). A more recent Danish study in COPD patients with hypertension among 1.3 million people showed that treatment with β-blockers reduced COPD hospitalization and mortality more than any other antihypertensive drug.

Although many studies have shown that β-blockers improve survival of patients with a large spectrum of cardiovascular disease, there are studies that show otherwise. Metoprolol failed to show any beneficial effects in terms of time to first ECOPD in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Cardio-selective β-blockers score better over non-selective β-blockers in patients with COPD in terms of all-cause mortality, major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events, heart failure hospitalizations and major adverse pulmonary events. A study with bisoprolol which has a higher β 1 :β 2 receptor selectivity ratio than metoprolol is currently underway.

Role of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors in COPD

An observational, nationwide registry of 38,862 COPD patients from Denmark showed that use of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors significantly reduced the risk of ECOPD and mortality by 14%. An earlier study reported that COPD patients who were using RAS blockers before hospital admission for ECOPD had a significant reduction in 30-day mortality. A recent meta-analysis of 20 studies, including > 500,000 COPD patients reported that use of RAS inhibitors was associated with reduced risk of death by 30% (22–39%), but failed to show any effect on ECOPD.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Chronic heart failure — beta-blockers with proven mortality benefit and agent selection is summarized as follows: Three beta-blockers have been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of death in patients with chronic heart failure (HF): bisoprolol, sustained-release metoprolol (succinate), and carvedilol; positive findings with these 3 agents should not be considered a class effect, and patients who have Stage C HF should be treated with 1 of these 3 beta-blockers. In one head-to-head trial, carvedilol (target dose 25 mg twice daily) versus immediate-release metoprolol tartrate (target dose 50 mg twice daily) was associated with a significantly reduced mortality, and there have been no trials to explore whether the survival benefits of carvedilol are greater than those of sustained-release metoprolol when both are used at the target doses.

### Impact of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: insights from PARAGON-HF [^593b9c85]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

In PARAGON‐HF, patients with COPD were older, more commonly men, and had a history of smoking. Patients with COPD were less likely to be treated with a beta blocker and had more severe functional limitation and impairment of quality of life than participants without COPD. While each of these findings are similar to those reported in patients with HFrEF with COPD, there were also differences. Higher levels of NT‐proBNP have been reported in patients with HFrEF with COPD, compared with patients with HFrEF without COPD. AF was more frequent in patients with HFrEF with COPD, compared with those without. Although not reported in the HFrEF studies, in PARAGON‐HF use of oral nitrates was more common in patients with COPD than without COPD. The reason is not clear but may reflect treatment for angina (given the greater prevalence of coronary heart disease and lower use of beta blockers in patients with COPD) or in the belief that nitrates might be efficacious in heart failure (given the greater symptom severity and functional limitation in patients with COPD). Either way, this is a notable finding given the observation in a recent randomized, placebo‐controlled trial that isosorbide mononitrate did not improve dyspnea and reduced, rather than increased, activity levels in patients with HFpEF.

Although used less than in patients without COPD, 75% of patients with COPD were treated with a beta blocker. Yet in a recent randomized, placebo‐controlled trial, the BLOCK COPD (Beta‐Blockers for the Prevention of Acute Exacerbations of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) trial, metoprolol exacerbated dyspnea and increased the risk of severe exacerbations in patients with COPD. Although the patients in BLOCK COPD were at high risk of exacerbation, and the risk related to use of beta blockers in patients with less COPD is unknown, it may be prudent to use these drugs in patients with HFpEF with COPD only where there is no other option. While beta blockers are an essential treatment in patients with HFrEF, there is no indication in HFpEF per se, and in PARAGON‐HF only a minority of patients with COPD had a firm alternative indication for beta blockade, such as prior myocardial infarction (25%). One avenue to potentially improve symptoms and outcomes in patients with HFpEF and more severe COPD may be to carefully evaluate whether beta blockade is appropriate, with alternative treatment options available for treatment of hypertension and ventricular rate control in AF.

Hypertension in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) — comorbidity and management: Hypertension is likely to be the most frequently occurring comorbidity in COPD with prognostic implications, and sub-optimally treated hypertension with diastolic dysfunction may mimic acute exacerbation symptoms and provoke hospitalization, emphasizing optimal blood pressure control. Hypertension should be treated according to usual guidelines with no evidence it should be treated differently in COPD, and there is no evidence that in people with COPD and increased cardiovascular risk cardio-selective beta-blockers either reduce the benefits of treatment with LABA or increase cardiovascular risk. COPD should be treated as usual as there is no direct evidence that COPD should be treated differently in the presence of hypertension.

Stimulation of beta2-adrenergic receptors can produce resting sinus tachycardia and has the potential to precipitate cardiac rhythm disturbances in susceptible patients; exaggerated somatic tremor is troublesome in some older patients at higher doses; hypokalemia can occur and oxygen consumption can be increased in chronic heart failure, but these metabolic effects decrease over time; mild falls in partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) can occur after SABAs and LABAs with uncertain clinical significance; and despite prior concerns, no association between beta2-agonist use and loss of lung function or increased mortality has been reported in COPD.

Conclusions

In this post hoc analysis of the ASCENT-COPD study of patients with moderate-to-severe COPD and increased CV risk, beta-blocker users and non-users had similar pre-bronchodilator FEV 1. The safety of aclidinium versus placebo, in terms of risk of (time to first) MACE and all-cause mortality, was not influenced by beta-blocker use. Treatment with aclidinium reduced the rate of COPD exacerbations, delayed the time to first exacerbations, and improved lung function regardless of beta-blocker use, with a greater benefit in FEV 1 observed in beta-blocker users versus non-users. This analysis supports the use of LAMAs with concomitant beta-blockers in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD and CV comorbidity.

### Heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease the quandary of beta-blockers and beta-agonists [^41933401]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

The combination of heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease presents many therapeutic challenges. The cornerstones of therapy are beta-blockers and beta-agonists, respectively. Their pharmacological effects are diametrically opposed, and each is purported to adversely affect the alternative condition. The tolerability of beta-blockade in patients with mild and fixed airflow obstruction likely extends to those with more severe disease. However, the evidence is rudimentary. The long-term influence of beta-blockade on pulmonary function, symptoms, and quality of life is unclear. Low-dose initiation and gradual up-titration of cardioselective beta-blockers is currently recommended. Robust clinical trials are needed to provide the answers that may finally allay physicians' mistrust of beta-blockers in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Beta-agonists are associated with incident heart failure in patients with pulmonary disease and with increased mortality and hospitalization in those with existing heart failure. These purported adverse effects require further investigation. In the meantime, clinicians should consider carefully the etiology of dyspnea and obtain objective evidence of airflow obstruction before prescribing beta-agonists to patients with heart failure.

Implications of Strong and Conditional Recommendations: From the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation Working Group

The target audience for this guideline includes specialists in respiratory medicine. However, given that COPD is a common condition, primary care physicians, internists, other healthcare professionals, patients, and policymakers may also find benefit from these recommendations.

Although the panel used a systematic approach and the best available evidence to develop this guideline, it is important to note that study participants in many clinical trials may not reflect all populations. Specifically, patients older than 80 years, those with multiple chronic conditions, and those with a codiagnosis of COPD and asthma are rarely represented in clinical trials. We recommend that for all clinical management decisions, the patient and the healthcare provider should engage in a shared decision-making process.

### Comparative effects of carvedilol and metoprolol on left ventricular ejection fraction in heart failure: results of a meta-analysis [^084f0722]. American Heart Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Both metoprolol and carvedilol improve cardiac function and prolong survival in patients with heart failure. Carvedilol has broader antiadrenergic effects than metoprolol, but it is not clear whether this characteristic is associated with greater benefits on cardiac function during long-term treatment.

Study Design

We performed a meta-analysis of all 19 randomized controlled trials of carvedilol or metoprolol that measured left ventricular ejection fraction before and after an average of 8.3 ± 0.1 months of treatment in 2184 patients with chronic heart failure. The mean daily doses were 58 ± 1 mg of carvedilol and the equivalent of 162 ± 1 mg of extended-release metoprolol. In the 15 placebo-controlled trials, the mean ejection fraction increased more in the trials of carvedilol than in the trials of metoprolol (placebo-corrected increases of +0.065 and +0.038, respectively), P = 0.0002. In the 4 active-controlled trials that compared metoprolol directly with carvedilol, the mean ejection fraction also increased more in the carvedilol groups than in the metoprolol groups (+0.084 on carvedilol and +0.057 on metoprolol, respectively), P = 0.009. The difference in favor of carvedilol in the active-controlled trials was nearly identical to the difference observed in the placebo-controlled trials and was apparent in patients with and without coronary artery disease.

Conclusion

Long-term treatment with carvedilol produces greater effects on left ventricular ejection fraction than metoprolol when both drugs are prescribed in doses similar to those that have been shown to prolong life.

Additionally, the expected outcome of beta-blockers having a greater effect on the cohort with cardiac comorbidity (MACRO) may not have been present due to baseline differences in the two groups.

### Detrimental effects of β-blockers in COPD: a concern for nonselective β-blockers [^59681b60]. Chest (2005). Low credibility.

Introduction

beta-Blockers are known to worsen FEV(1) and airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) in patients with asthma. Both characteristics determine the outcome of COPD, a disease with frequent cardiac comorbidity requiring beta-blocker treatment.

Objective

To determine the effects of beta-blockers on AHR (provocative concentration of methacholine causing a 20% fall in FEV(1) [PC(20)]), FEV(1), and response to formoterol in patients with COPD.

Design

A double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, cross-over study.

Setting

An ambulatory, hospital outpatient clinic of pulmonary diseases.

Patients

Patients with mild-to-moderate irreversible COPD and AHR.

Intervention

Fifteen patients received propranolol (80 mg), metoprolol (100 mg), celiprolol (200 mg), or placebo for 4 days, followed by a washout period ≥ 3 days. On day 4 of treatment, FEV(1) and PC(20) were assessed. Immediately hereafter, formoterol (12 microg) was administered and FEV(1) was measured for up to 30 min.

Results

PC(20) was significantly lower (p < 0.01) with propranolol and metoprolol treatment (geometric means, 2.06 mg/mL and 2.02 mg/mL, respectively) than with placebo (3.16 mg/mL) or celiprolol (3.41 mg/mL). FEV(1) deteriorated only after propranolol treatment (2.08 ± 0.31 L) [mean ± SD] compared with placebo (2.24 ± 0.37 L). The fast bronchodilating effect of formoterol was hampered by propranolol (mean increase in FEV(1) at 3 min, 6.7 ± 8.9%) but was unaffected by the other beta-blockers (16.9 ± 9.8%, 22 ± 11.6%, and 16.9 ± 9.0% for placebo, metoprolol, and celiprolol, respectively).

Conclusions

Pulmonary effects did not occur by celiprolol. Only propranolol reduced FEV(1) and the bronchodilating effect of formoterol. Both metoprolol and propranolol increased AHR. Thus, different classes of beta-blockers have different pulmonary effects. The anticipated beneficial cardiovascular effects of a beta-blocker must be weighted against the putative detrimental pulmonary effects, ie, effect on FEV(1), AHR, and response to additional beta(2)-agonists.

### Coexisting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and heart failure: implications for treatment, course and mortality [^0cdc29db]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and heart failure are prevalent comorbidities affecting a huge proportion of the world population, responsible for significant morbidity and mortality. Their coexistence is more frequent than previously recognized and poses important diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Prognosis of patients with concurrent heart failure and COPD has not been comprehensively addressed. With this review, we intend to emphasize the diagnosis and prognosis implications of the two coexisting conditions and to highlight the therapeutic constraints posed by the combination.

Recent Findings

Progressively, more attention has been given to the interplay between COPD and heart failure. The combination is frequent, but largely unrecognized due to overlapping clinical manifestations. Patients presenting with both conditions seem to have an ominous course. Despite the overwhelming evidence supporting cardioselective beta-blockade safety and tolerability in COPD patients, beta-blockers are underprescribed to heart failure patients with concomitant COPD.

Summary

COPD and heart failure coexistence is often overlooked. COPD diagnosis can remain unsuspected in heart failure patients due to similar symptoms. Although beta-blockers are well tolerated in COPD patients, they are overall less prescribed in this challenging population. COPD, at least at severe degrees of airflow obstruction, predicts a worse prognosis in heart failure patients.

Table 5. Results of COMET

It is not known whether this formulation of metoprolol at any dose or this low dose of metoprolol in any formulation has any effect on survival or hospitalization in patients with heart failure. Thus, this trial extends the time over which carvedilol manifests benefits on survival in heart failure, but it is not evidence that carvedilol improves outcome over the formulation of metoprolol (TOPROL-XL) with benefits in heart failure.

Severe Heart Failure (COPERNICUS)

In a double-blind trial, 2,289 subjects with heart failure at rest or with minimal exertion and left ventricular ejection fraction less than 25% (mean 20%), despite digitalis (66%), diuretics (99%), and ACE inhibitors (89%), were randomized to placebo or carvedilol. Carvedilol was titrated from a starting dose of 3.125 mg twice daily to the maximum tolerated dose or up to 25 mg twice daily over a minimum of 6 weeks. Most subjects achieved the target dose of 25 mg. The trial was conducted in Eastern and Western Europe, the United States, Israel, and Canada. Similar numbers of subjects per group (about 100) withdrew during the titration period.

5.4 Heart Failure/Fluid Retention

Worsening heart failure or fluid retention may occur during up-titration of carvedilol. If such symptoms occur, diuretics should be increased and the carvedilol dose should not be advanced until clinical stability resumes [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. Occasionally it is necessary to lower the carvedilol dose or temporarily discontinue it. Such episodes do not preclude subsequent successful titration of, or a favorable response to, carvedilol. In a placebo-controlled trial of subjects with severe heart failure, worsening heart failure during the first 3 months was reported to a similar degree with carvedilol and with placebo. When treatment was maintained beyond 3 months, worsening heart failure was reported less frequently in subjects treated with carvedilol than with placebo. Worsening heart failure observed during long-term therapy is more likely to be related to the patients' underlying disease than to treatment with carvedilol.

5.5 Non-allergic Bronchospasm

Patients with bronchospastic disease (e.g., chronic bronchitis, emphysema) should, in general, not receive β-blockers. Carvedilol tablets may be used with caution, however, in patients who do not respond to, or cannot tolerate, other antihypertensive agents. It is prudent, if carvedilol tablets are used, to use the smallest effective dose, so that inhibition of endogenous or exogenous β-agonists is minimized.

In clinical trials of subjects with heart failure, subjects with bronchospastic disease were enrolled if they did not require oral or inhaled medication to treat their bronchospastic disease. In such patients, it is recommended that carvedilol be used with caution. The dosing recommendations should be followed closely and the dose should be lowered if any evidence of bronchospasm is observed during up-titration.

Severe Heart Failure (COPERNICUS)

In a double-blind trial (COPERNICUS), 2,289 subjects with heart failure at rest or with minimal exertion and left ventricular ejection fraction less than 25% (mean 20%), despite digitalis (66%), diuretics (99%), and ACE inhibitors (89%) were randomized to placebo or carvedilol. Carvedilol was titrated from a starting dose of 3.125 mg twice daily to the maximum tolerated dose or up to 25 mg twice daily over a minimum of 6 weeks. Most subjects achieved the target dose of 25 mg. The trial was conducted in Eastern and Western Europe, the United States, Israel, and Canada. Similar numbers of subjects per group (about 100) withdrew during the titration period.
