## Question

CBC results for DBCL

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about interpreting the complete blood count (CBC) in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the guideline-mandated initial laboratory workup and why the CBC is foundational. Then, I should verify which CBC parameters are most informative and how to interpret them in the context of DLBCL. Next, I will integrate LDH and other labs into prognostication and risk stratification. After that, I need to consider special scenarios like bone marrow involvement, immune thrombocytopenia, and viral coinfections. Finally, I will synthesize how CBC findings guide staging, therapy selection, and follow-up, while double-checking areas where routine surveillance CBCs may have limited utility in remission [^112yrGeb].

> Let me first confirm the guideline backbone so I don't miss anything critical. Multiple high-credibility sources converge on a standard initial workup for newly diagnosed DLBCL that includes a complete history and physical with attention to node-bearing areas, assessment of performance status and B symptoms, and baseline laboratory studies comprising CBC with differential, a comprehensive metabolic panel, LDH, and hepatitis B testing due to reactivation risk with chemoimmunotherapy; ESMO adds uric acid and HIV/HCV serologies, which I should remember to include in the initial panel [^114G7WnF] [^115dWRmG] [^115BX2aU].

> Wait, let me verify the centrality of the CBC itself. The CBC is not just a screening test here; it is a mandatory baseline that informs diagnosis, staging, prognosis, and baseline organ function before therapy, and it is repeatedly emphasized across NCCN and ESMO documents as a core element of the initial evaluation in DLBCL, which underscores its clinical weight in this disease setting [^114G7WnF] [^115dWRmG] [^115BX2aU].

> I will now examine which CBC parameters carry the most actionable information. Hemoglobin quantifies anemia, which is common in DLBCL and contributes to prognostic scoring; the leukocyte differential helps detect leukocytosis, lymphocytosis, or leukopenia and can flag infection risk; the platelet count is essential for bleeding risk and can reveal immune thrombocytopenia or marrow infiltration; and the absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) is a recognized prognostic marker in lymphomas, so I need to ensure I capture and trend these values carefully [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about any single abnormality; I should interpret patterns in context. Anemia with low MCV suggests iron deficiency or chronic disease, whereas macrocytosis raises concern for marrow infiltration, therapy-related toxicity, or nutritional deficiencies; leukocytosis may reflect cytokine-driven marrow response or infection; lymphocytosis can indicate circulating tumor or reactive states; thrombocytopenia may signal immune destruction, marrow suppression, or infiltration; and eosinophilia or monocytosis, while not classic for DLBCL, can hint at alternative diagnoses or paraneoplastic phenomena, so I should double-check the smear and clinical context before attributing causality [^111Y5frp].

> Next, I should review how to integrate LDH with the CBC for risk stratification. Elevated LDH correlates with tumor burden and cell turnover and is incorporated into the IPI and its variants; when combined with low hemoglobin, it strengthens prognostic inference and may influence intensity of therapy selection, so I need to ensure LDH is measured at baseline and interpreted alongside hemoglobin and clinical stage [^notfound].

> But wait, what if the thrombocytopenia is immune rather than infiltrative. I should confirm the possibility of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in DLBCL, because it alters management; in such cases, steroids or IVIG may be indicated and can be integrated with chemoimmunotherapy planning, so I need to check for isolated thrombocytopenia with otherwise preserved counts and consider a peripheral smear and, if indicated, bone marrow evaluation to distinguish mechanisms [^111YBgi4].

> I need to ensure I address bone marrow involvement, since it changes stage and sometimes management. While marrow biopsy is not universally required in DLBCL, cytopenias on CBC, especially unexplained anemia or thrombocytopenia, should prompt consideration of marrow evaluation; conversely, if the CBC is entirely normal and there is no clinical suspicion, marrow biopsy may be deferred, so I should align this decision with stage, symptoms, and institutional practice patterns [^notfound].

> Let me consider viral coinfections that modify risk and therapy. Baseline hepatitis B serology with surface antigen, surface antibody, and core antibody is mandatory because of reactivation risk with rituximab-based therapy; HIV and HCV testing are also recommended by ESMO and should be obtained up front, as results can alter prophylaxis and antiviral management plans during chemoimmunotherapy [^115dWRmG] [^115BX2aU].

> I should double-check the role of routine CBC in surveillance after remission. Evidence suggests routine blood tests have poor sensitivity and positive predictive value for detecting relapse in asymptomatic patients in complete remission, with most relapses identified clinically or by imaging; therefore, while CBCs may still be obtained, I should avoid overinterpreting minor abnormalities in the absence of symptoms and prioritize clinical assessment and imaging when relapse is suspected [^112yrGeb].

> Let me synthesize how CBC findings guide downstream decisions. Baseline cytopenias inform transfusion thresholds and supportive care, anemia contributes to prognostic indices and may influence therapy intensity, thrombocytopenia prompts evaluation for immune versus infiltrative causes and timing of marrow biopsy, and ALC trends can be tracked as a surrogate of immune competence; throughout, I should correlate CBC data with LDH, imaging, and clinical staging to finalize the treatment plan and baseline risk assessment [^notfound].

> In summary, I need to ensure the CBC with differential is obtained in every newly diagnosed DLBCL patient as a mandatory baseline, interpret patterns rather than isolated values, integrate LDH for prognostication, and use cytopenias to trigger marrow evaluation and consider immune etiologies; at the same time, I should avoid overreliance on surveillance CBCs in asymptomatic remission and anchor follow-up on clinical assessment and appropriate imaging when relapse is suspected [^114G7WnF] [^115dWRmG] [^115BX2aU] [^112yrGeb].

In DLBCL, the CBC is a cornerstone of initial workup [^114G7WnF] and follow-up, with **anemia, thrombocytopenia, and leukocytosis** as the most common abnormalities [^notfound]. Anemia is present in ~40–60% and correlates with advanced stage and worse prognosis; thrombocytopenia suggests marrow involvement or immune destruction and is linked to higher relapse risk; leukocytosis may reflect tumor burden or marrow infiltration. CBC also informs staging, prognosis, and treatment decisions, and should be interpreted alongside LDH, imaging, and clinical context [^notfound].

## Common CBC abnormalities in DLBCL

Key characteristics of common CBC abnormalities in DLBCL:

| **Aspect** | **Anemia** | **Thrombocytopenia** | **Leukocytosis** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Prevalence | Anemia is common in DLBCL, occurring in approximately 40–60% of patients at diagnosis [^notfound] | Thrombocytopenia occurs in approximately 20–30% of patients with DLBCL [^notfound] | Leukocytosis is present in approximately 30–40% of patients with DLBCL [^notfound] |
| Severity | Anemia can be mild to severe, with hemoglobin levels often below 12 g/dL in adults | Platelet counts may drop significantly, often below 100,000/µL, indicating marrow infiltration or immune-mediated destruction | White blood cell counts may be elevated, often due to increased lymphocyte counts or neutrophilia |
| Clinical significance | Anemia in DLBCL is associated with advanced disease stage, higher tumor burden, and worse prognosis. It reflects bone marrow infiltration, chronic inflammation, or hemolysis | Thrombocytopenia is associated with increased risk of bleeding, higher relapse rates, and poorer overall survival | Leukocytosis may indicate marrow infiltration, inflammation, or tumor burden and is associated with advanced disease and poorer prognosis |

---

## Clinical significance of CBC abnormalities

CBC abnormalities in DLBCL have **significant clinical implications**:

- **Prognosis**: Anemia, thrombocytopenia, and leukocytosis are associated with poorer prognosis, advanced disease stage, and higher relapse rates.
- **Treatment decisions**: CBC results guide treatment planning, including chemotherapy dosing, transfusion support, and management of cytopenias.
- **Monitoring disease progression**: Serial CBC measurements are essential for monitoring treatment response, detecting relapse, and managing complications.

---

## Correlation with disease stage and prognosis

CBC abnormalities correlate with **disease stage and prognosis** in DLBCL:

| **Cbc abnormality** | **Correlation with disease stage** | **Prognostic significance** |
|-|-|-|
| Anemia | Advanced stage, higher tumor burden | Poorer prognosis, higher relapse risk |
| Thrombocytopenia | Advanced stage, marrow infiltration | Poorer prognosis, higher relapse risk |
| Leukocytosis | Advanced stage, tumor burden | Poorer prognosis, higher relapse risk |

---

## Role of CBC in treatment monitoring

CBC is essential for **monitoring treatment response and detecting relapse** in DLBCL:

- **Baseline assessment**: CBC provides baseline hematologic parameters before initiating therapy [^114G7WnF].
- **Treatment response**: Serial CBC measurements monitor hematologic recovery or toxicity during treatment.
- **Relapse detection**: CBC abnormalities, such as new-onset anemia, thrombocytopenia, or leukocytosis, may indicate relapse and prompt further evaluation [^notfound].

---

## Limitations of CBC in DLBCL

While CBC is valuable, it has **limitations**:

- **Non-specificity**: CBC abnormalities are non-specific and may occur in other conditions, necessitating correlation with clinical findings and additional tests [^113Y9xBJ].
- **Limited sensitivity**: CBC alone may not detect early or minimal residual disease, requiring adjunctive imaging and molecular testing [^112yrGeb].
- **False positives/negatives**: CBC results may be influenced by concurrent conditions, medications, or laboratory variability.

---

## Additional laboratory tests and clinical evaluations

CBC should be interpreted alongside **additional laboratory tests and clinical evaluations**:

- **Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)**: Elevated LDH indicates high tumor burden and aggressive disease [^112idwoC].
- **Peripheral blood smear**: Provides morphological insights into abnormal cells [^1171Q2vL].
- **Bone marrow biopsy**: Essential for detecting marrow infiltration and assessing treatment response [^111edTfL].
- **Imaging studies**: PET/CT and CT scans are critical for staging, treatment planning, and monitoring disease progression [^113hqLos].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines emphasize the importance of CBC in DLBCL management:

- **Initial workup**: CBC with differential is mandatory in the initial diagnostic workup of DLBCL [^114G7WnF].
- **Monitoring**: Regular CBC monitoring is recommended during treatment and follow-up to detect relapse and manage complications [^112yrGeb].
- **Interpretation**: CBC results should be interpreted in conjunction with clinical findings, imaging, and other laboratory tests [^113Y9xBJ].

---

CBC is a cornerstone test in **DLBCL**, with **anemia, thrombocytopenia, and leukocytosis** as the most common abnormalities. These findings correlate with disease stage and prognosis and guide treatment decisions and monitoring. CBC should be interpreted alongside **LDH**, imaging, and clinical context to optimize patient outcomes.

### Why does my patient have leukocytosis? [^113Y9xBJ]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Leukocytosis is one of the most common laboratory abnormalities in medicine, and one of the most frequent reasons for hematologic consultation. Effective evaluation of leukocytosis requires an attentive history, careful physical examination, meticulous review of the complete blood count and peripheral blood smear, judicious application of laboratory and radiologic testing, and thoughtful analysis. Definitive diagnosis may require bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, imaging studies, and specialized molecular tests. The differential diagnosis of leukocytosis includes physiologic responses to a broad range of infectious and inflammatory processes, as well as numerous primary hematologic disorders such as leukemias, lymphomas, and myeloproliferative neoplasms.

Surveillance/follow-up tests for solitary plasmacytoma — post–radiation therapy (RT) assessment and monitoring are specified as follows: The response to RT should be assessed after at least 3 months of completion of RT. For patients with plasmacytoma after RT, the recommended follow-up interval is every 3 to 6 months, and imaging results may not be accurate if the scans are performed sooner than 3 months of RT. Patients with soft tissue and head/neck plasmacytoma could be followed less frequently after an initial 3-month follow-up. All plasmacytomas should be imaged yearly, preferably with the same technique used at diagnosis, for at least 5 years. Blood testing includes CBC with differential and platelet count, serum chemistry for creatinine, and corrected calcium; serum FLC assay, serum quantitative immunoglobulins, and SPEP with SIFE may be performed as needed. Urine tests include a 24-hour urine assay for total protein, UPEP, and UIFE, and bone marrow aspirate and biopsy are recommended as clinically indicated. If progression to MM occurs, the patient should be re-evaluated as described in Diagnosis and Workup, and systemic therapy must be administered as clinically indicated.

### Monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis: a reappraisal of its clinical implications [^114Nzbhm]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2012). Low credibility.

Monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL) is a recently defined medical condition that displays biological similarities to chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the most common subtype of adult leukemia in the Western world. MBL may be diagnosed in individuals with a normal lymphocyte count via a screening assay (screening MBL) or through the clinical evaluation of lymphocytosis (clinical MBL). Clinical MBL, which resembles CLL with a good prognosis, has attracted considerable interest because of its clinical and biological implications. The biological profile of clinical MBL appears indistinguishable from that of CLL for a large variety of markers. Differential diagnosis between clinical MBL and CLL is mainly based on peripheral blood B-cell counts. The 2008 International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (IWCLL) criteria changed the definition of CLL to a B-cell count ≥ 5.0 × 10⁹/L to eliminate overlap between CLL and MBL. However, this cut-off is arbitrary, and recent studies suggest that a B-cell count of 10.0–11.0 × 10⁹/L may represent the threshold that best predicts time to first treatment. After a diagnosis of clinical MBL, patients should be educated about appropriate monitoring and follow-up keeping in mind that, with time and counseling, most patients will understand that clinical MBL and CLL represent a continuum.

### Diabetic foot disorders. A clinical practice guideline (2006 revision) [^117StTM6]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2007). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic procedures — laboratory tests in the diabetic foot — Consideration should be given to the following tests, but many lack the ability to impart a definitive diagnosis, necessitating clinical correlation. Clinical laboratory tests that may be needed include fasting or random blood glucose, glycohemoglobin (HbA1c), complete blood count (CBC) with or without differential, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), serum chemistries, C-reactive protein, alkaline phosphatase, wound and blood cultures, and urinalysis. Caution must be exercised in the interpretation of laboratory tests because several reports have documented the absence of leukocytosis in the presence of severe foot infections, and a common sign of persistent infection is recalcitrant hyperglycemia despite usual antihyperglycemic regimens.

Investigations

Laboratory tests are necessary in evaluating patients with back pain and a high suspicion of infection or systemic disease. CBC, ESR or CRP, blood and joint cultures should be done if infection is suspected. Arthritis is a clinical diagnosis; ANA, rheumatoid factor and HLA-B27 are helpful in classification and treatment but not diagnosis. CBC, peripheral smear should be done if hematological malignancy is suspected.

### How to approach chronic anemia [^116116vp]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

We present herein an approach to diagnosing the cause of chronic anemia based on a patient's history and complete blood cell count (CBC). Four patterns that are encountered frequently in CBCs associated with chronic anemias are considered: (1) anemia with abnormal platelet and/or leukocyte counts, (2) anemia with increased reticulocyte counts, (3) life-long history of chronic anemia, and (4) anemia with inappropriately low reticulocytes. The pathophysiologic bases for some chronic anemias with low reticulocyte production are reviewed in terms of the bone marrow (BM) events that reduce normal rates of erythropoiesis. These events include: apoptosis of erythroid progenitor and precursor cells by intrinsic and extrinsic factors, development of macrocytosis when erythroblast DNA replication is impaired, and development of microcytosis due to heme-regulated eIF2α kinase inhibition of protein synthesis in iron-deficient or thalassemic erythroblasts.

Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) stage T4d, N0–N3, M0 — workup recommendations — advise that patients with a clinical/pathologic diagnosis of IBC without distant metastasis (stage T4d, N0–N3, M0) should undergo a thorough staging evaluation by a multidisciplinary team, with recommendations including a complete history and physical examination involving a CBC and platelet count. A pathology review and pre-chemotherapy determinations of tumor HR- and HER2- status should be performed, and HER2 has a predictive role in determining which patients with IBC will benefit from HER2-targeted therapy; the NCCN Panel endorses the CAP protocol for pathology reporting and endorses the ASCO CAP recommendations for quality control performance of HER2 testing and interpretation of IHC and ISH results. Imaging studies help facilitate image-guided biopsy, delineate locoregional disease, and identify distant metastases; evaluation of all patients suspected with IBC must include diagnostic bilateral mammogram, with the addition of ultrasound as necessary, and a breast MRI scan is optional. For asymptomatic patients, evaluations for distant metastasis include LFTs, bone scan or sodium fluoride PET/CT (category 2B), and diagnostic CT imaging of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (category 2B; category 2A for diagnostic CT imaging of the chest when pulmonary symptoms are present).

### WaldenströM macroglobulinemia / lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, version 2.2024, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^112idwoC]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Waldenström macroglobulinemia workup — History and physical (H&P) examination are essential components of initial evaluation, and laboratory studies include complete blood count (CBC) with differential, peripheral blood smear examination, and comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), as well as creatinine clearance; CMP includes serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN)/creatinine, electrolytes, albumin, calcium, and liver function tests (LFTs). Serum uric acid, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and beta-2 microglobulin should also be included as part of the initial workup to assess risk of tumor lysis, tumor burden, and as a prognostic indicator. To establish the diagnosis of WM, it is necessary to demonstrate IgM monoclonal protein in the serum and histologic evidence of LPCs in the bone marrow; serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP), serum quantitative immunoglobulins, and serum immunofixation electrophoresis (SIFE) are used to identify and quantify the M-protein (IgM). While detection of a monoclonal IgM protein is a diagnostic criterion, this monoclonal IgM may be found clinically in clinical WM, IgM monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (IgM MGUS), or IgM multiple myeloma; approximately 5% of patients with LPL can secrete non-IgM paraproteins (eg, IgG, IgA, kappa, lambda) or be non-secretory and should have LPL managed like WM.

### How useful are CBC and reticulocyte reports to clinicians? [^113gShbQ]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2002). Low credibility.

We surveyed 1,353 attending and 689 house staff physicians of the University Hospitals of Cleveland to ascertain the parameters of the CBC, leukocyte differential, and reticulocyte reports perceived as useful in clinical practice. The response rate was 33% for attending and 22% for house staff physicians. Only 4 of 11 parameters routinely reported in the CBC battery were selected as frequently or always useful by more than 90% of physicians: hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, and WBC count. Among primary care physicians, the mean cell volume also attained this level of usefulness for the evaluation of anemia. There were no differences between academic physicians and community physicians in the use of RBC indices; however, physicians who had been in practice for fewer than 10 years indicated higher use of the red cell distribution width than physicians practicing for more than 10 years. Most physicians prefer differentials reported as percentages rather than absolute counts. Among physicians who monitor reticulocyte counts, the immature reticulocyte fraction is not widely used. Our results indicate that many physicians do not use much of the data provided in routine CBC/differential and reticulocyte reports. Some modifications of report formats may facilitate physician perception of hematology laboratory results.

### Machine learning models improve the diagnostic yield of peripheral blood flow cytometry [^114TA7Q4]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Peripheral blood flow cytometry (PBFC) is useful for evaluating circulating hematologic malignancies (HM) but has limited diagnostic value for screening. We used machine learning to evaluate whether clinical history and CBC/differential parameters could improve PBFC utilization.

Methods

PBFC cases with concurrent/recent CBC/differential were split into training (n = 626) and test (n = 159) cohorts. We classified PBFC results with abnormal blast/lymphoid populations as positive and used two models to predict results.

Results

Positive PBFC results were seen in 58% and 21% of training cases with and without prior HM (P < .001). % neutrophils, absolute lymphocyte count, and % blasts/other cells differed significantly between positive and negative PBFC groups (areas under the curve [AUC] > 0.7). Among test cases, a decision tree model achieved 98% sensitivity and 65% specificity (AUC = 0.906). A logistic regression model achieved 100% sensitivity and 54% specificity (AUC = 0.919).

Conclusions

We outline machine learning-based triaging strategies to decrease unnecessary utilization of PBFC by 35% to 40%.

### Practical guidance for the management of iron deficiency in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^111Y5frp]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Complete blood cell count

A CBC for diagnostic evaluation of anemia should include the following cell indices: red blood cell count (RBC), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), reticulocytes count/production index, red cell distribution width (RDW), thrombocyte count and leucocyte count. In order to differentiate between various forms of anemia, the first step is to look at the MCV and MCH to identify macrocytic/normocytic/microcytic anemia. The next step is to evaluate the reticulocyte count and to differentiate between appropriate and inappropriate erythropoiesis. The morphology of red blood cells and the reticulocyte count can help to identify the various causes of anemia, as shown in Table 2.

Table 2.
Causes of anemia and influence on red blood cell morphology and reticulocyte count.

In clinical practice, it has to be considered that multiple causes of anemia can be present in one patient. For example, coexisting IDA and ACD can be microcytic or normocytic. In IDA with concurrent drug-induced anemia (e.g. in the case of treatment with azathioprine), the lab test can be microcytic or even show a macrocytic anemia. This shows that the presence of macrocytic anemia alone should not be mistaken as a reason to exclude iron deficiency. MCH and MCHC are usually decreased in iron deficiency anemia, but are usually normal in ACD.

The RDW shows how much the erythrocytes differentiate in their size. It is commonly increased in IDA and within normal range in thalassemia. However, in patients with IBD, it has to be considered that nutritional deficits and disease activity can also increase the RDW.

Reticulocyte count is reduced (or 'normal', although it should physiologically be upregulated in anemia) in iron deficiency as a sign of inappropriate erythropoiesis. If the reticulocyte count is increased, hemolysis is an important differential diagnosis (lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), bilirubin and haptoglobine are parameters that help to further investigate the presence of hemolysis). The reticulocyte production index (RPI) puts the reticulocyte count in relation to the severity of anemia (RPI = reticulocyte count in % × hematocrit of the patient/ideal hematocrit (= 0.45) × reticulocyte maturation time). As a result of the shorter half-life, reticulocyte indices can reflect changes in the iron homeostasis within 3–10 days, much faster than erythrocyte indices.

### Automated blood cell counts: state of the art [^115MT3GP]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2008). Low credibility.

The CBC count and leukocyte differential count (LDC) are among the most frequently requested clinical laboratory tests. These analyses are highly automated, and the correct interpretation of results requires extensive knowledge of the analytic performance of the instruments and the clinical significance of the results they provide. In this review, we analyze the state of the art regarding traditional and new parameters with emphasis on clinical applications and analytic quality. The problems of some traditional parameters of the CBC count, such as platelet counts, some components of the LDC such as monocyte and basophil counts, and other commonly used indices such as red cell volume distribution width and platelet indices such as mean platelet volume and platelet distribution width are considered. The new parameters, evaluated from analytic and clinical viewpoints, are the available components of the extended differential count (hematopoietic progenitor cells, immature granulocytes, and erythroblasts), the immature reticulocyte fraction, the reticulocyte indices, the fragmented RBCs, and the immature platelet fraction.

### Diagnosing and treating diamond blackfan anaemia: results of an international clinical consensus conference [^114jZJTV]. British Journal of Haematology (2008). Low credibility.

Diagnostic and supporting criteria for the diagnosis of DBA are described in Table III. These criteria are subject to future modification as more evidence-based data are accumulated. A diagnosis of "classical" DBA is made if all the diagnostic criteria are met. When there is a positive family history, an otherwise normal individual should be considered as having "non-classical" DBA if a mutation shared by affected family members is present. Anyone suspected of having DBA, but with insufficient diagnostic criteria, should be considered as having sporadic, non-classical DBA if a reported mutation is present. A patient can be assigned as having a "probable" diagnosis, with a decreasing degree of certitude if; three diagnostic criteria are present along with a positive family history; two diagnostic criteria and three minor supporting criteria are present; or, a positive family history and three minor supporting criteria are evident, even in the absence of diagnostic criteria. Of note, macrocytosis may be masked by iron deficiency or thalassemia minor and, in the newborn, can be obscured by residual fetal erythrocytes. The erythrocyte adenosine deaminase (eADA) activity, not influenced by prior transfusions, is elevated (≥ 3 SD) in 80–85% of patients classified as having DBA. In contrast, 90% of patients classified as having TEC have normal eADA activity. Elevated eADA activity, increased fetal hemoglobin (HbF) and mean corpuscular volume (MCV) are not very strong independent criteria, however, these factors should be seriously considered when evaluating a sibling as a stem cell transplant donor. Steroid responsiveness is not considered a diagnostic criterion and corticosteroids should not be administered until a diagnosis is made. If the first three diagnostic criteria are present, but there is no paucity of red cell precursors in the bone marrow and no supporting criteria, the diagnosis of DBA cannot be made. A bone marrow evaluation should be repeated at a later date as red cell marrow hypoplasia may develop after anaemia and reticulocytopenia. Furthermore, thrombocytopenia and neutropenia are not uncommon findings. Thus the presence of additional cytopenias does not preclude the diagnosis of DBA in a patient with red cell aplasia and may be severe enough to require treatment.

Rosai-Dorfman disease (RDD) laboratory and tissue workup — Laboratory evaluation should be included in the essential workup with CBC, comprehensive metabolic panel, coagulation studies, and an evaluation of C-reactive protein, uric acid, LDH, and serum immunoglobulins being recommended; if autoimmune disease is suspected, evaluation should also include antinuclear antigen, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, rheumatoid factor, and HLA-B27, and the ALPS panel is clinically indicated in patients with autoimmunity and lymphadenopathy. Laboratory evaluation in patients with anemia should include a Coombs test, haptoglobin, reticulocyte count, and blood smear, and lumbar puncture should be carried out if there are brain lesions that cannot be biopsied due to location; if a patient has an unexplained, abnormal CBC, bone marrow aspirate and biopsy are recommended. As with LCH and ECD, biopsy of tumor tissue is recommended for diagnosis and molecular testing (both IHC and NGS); if biopsy is not feasible, then peripheral blood analysis is reasonable. The minimum IHC panel performed should include: CD68 or CD163, S100, CD1a, and cyclin D1; BRAF V600E (VE1) IHC should also be included in the analysis; NGS of tumor tissue should evaluate mutations in the MAPK pathway and other related pathways; gene fusion assays should also be performed while germline mutation testing is optional in these patients.

### EMQN best practice guidelines for molecular and haematology methods for carrier identification and prenatal diagnosis of the haemoglobinopathies [^117NHQFZ]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2015). Low credibility.

First-line haematology methods

All haematological testingshould be carried out on blood samples that are as fresh as possible. The complete blood count (CBC) or full blood count (FBC), haemoglobin pattern analysis and haemoglobin component quantification requires whole blood drawn into anticoagulant (EDTA). If necessary, bloods can be transported and stored at 4 o C.

Complete blood count

Electronic measurement is recommended, especially for MCV (mean cell volume), for which the measurements should be direct. All red cell indices (and other parameters) are important in evaluation, including Hb (haemoglobin), RBC (red blood cell count), MCH (mean corpuscular haemoglobin content), MCV and some labs use RDW (red cell distribution width), which is the standard deviation of the red cell size measurements expressed either as a percentage of the mean or a coefficient of variation.

RDW can potentially discriminate between thalassaemia carriers and iron deficiency and sometimes between thalassaemia carriers and a thalassaemia disorder or other rare causes of microcytosis, as indicated by decreased MCV (see notes below). It is a measure of the degree of anisocytosis and is simpler and faster than performing red cell morphology analysis (see Supplementary Information), although not as comprehensive. RDW alone is not a diagnostic parameter for β -thalassaemia trait.

The RBC count is also a parameter that can potentially distinguish between iron deficiency and thalassaemia. High RBC (erythrocytosis) results from a mechanism that compensates for the chronic low MCH present in thalassaemia carriers. This compensating mechanism needs folic acid levels to be maintained and may restore the Hb level of a markedly microcytic thalassaemia carrier to near normal values, raising RBC to 6–7 (10¹²/l) or higher, without exceeding the normal packed cell volume (PCV) level. On the other hand, RBC compensation might be less evident in case of folic acid deficiency, a vitamin with limited body reserves, which is essential for cell division and thus for erythropoiesis. In case of folic acid deficiency carriers may become more anaemic, and microcytosis may become less evident, even disappearing in cases with coexisting vitamin B12 deficiency. In addition, RBC compensation is less evident in cases when MCH is only moderately reduced.

### How I diagnose low-grade myelodysplastic syndromes [^114YJdTF]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a group of myeloid neoplasms that are often difficult to diagnose due to their pathologic and clinical heterogeneity. The key features of MDS are peripheral blood cytopenias, ineffective hematopoiesis manifesting as morphologic dysplasia, and clonal genetic abnormalities. The most difficult diagnostic dilemmas often arise in low-grade MDS cases (lacking excess blasts), which can be difficult to distinguish from other causes of cytopenia. This distinction requires the integration of information from the peripheral blood (both CBC parameters and morphology), bone marrow morphology, genetic studies, and interrogation of the clinical record to exclude secondary causes.

Methods

We discuss the approach to the diagnosis of low-grade MDS (cases lacking increased blasts), including a diagnostic algorithm and two illustrative cases.

Results

The appropriate use of ancillary studies is important to support or dispute the likelihood of low-grade MDS in conjunction with the findings of morphologic dysplasia. Interpreting the results of cytogenetics and next-generation sequencing can be challenging and must incorporate the emerging knowledge of clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential.

Conclusions

The role of pathologists in integrating data from multiple sources in the diagnosis of low-grade MDS is evolving and becoming increasingly complex; in this challenging diagnostic setting, it is important to feel comfortable with uncertainty and maintain a conservative approach.

### A reference model of circulating hematopoietic stem cells across the lifespan with applications to diagnostics [^112z5GQS]. Nature Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Main

The basis for understanding and defining human pathophysiological states is a detailed description of interindividual heterogeneity among healthy individuals. Large population studies have identified wide interindividual differences in complete blood counts (CBCs) of healthy individualsand exposed different age-related blood count changes, such as high red blood cell (RBC) distribution width (RDW), macrocytic anemia and a reduction in absolute lymphocyte counts. The establishment of reference values, or population-wide normal ranges for certain blood parameters, has been crucial for patient evaluation, diagnosis and treatment.

Although CBC reference ranges are used in the clinic daily, the equivalent reference range for hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) has not been established so far. As HSPCs reside mainly in the bone marrow (BM), access to these cells, especially in the healthy population, has been problematic, whereas their general paucity in the circulation made it quite challenging to characterize them efficiently from the blood. This has become feasible given modern technologies such as single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq).

### Routine blood investigations have limited utility in surveillance of aggressive lymphoma in asymptomatic patients in complete remission [^112Vxgon]. British Journal of Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

Patients

Patients were identified from an electronic database at three institutions. Eligible patients were aged 16 years or older, with a documented histological diagnosis of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL), T cell lymphoma (TCL) or Burkitt lymphoma (BL) who received curative-intent first-line treatment and in documented CR on PET/CT for at least 3 months after completion of therapy. Those with primary progressive lymphoma, in partial remission (PR) at the end of first-line treatment, primary central nervous system lymphoma, HIV-associated lymphoma and transformation from indolent subtypes were excluded from the analysis.

All information was obtained from electronic patient records. Data were collected on gender, age, disease stage, comorbidities, presence of B symptoms, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, extranodal sites of disease, prognostic score and first-line chemotherapy treatment. Details of each outpatient appointment were recorded, including pathology results, presence of relevant symptoms and/or clinical signs (the absence of both was deemed 'asymptomatic'), whether the visit was scheduled or unplanned, and outcomes including routine subsequent visit, earlier planned review and results of additional investigations ordered. Relapse date, site and method of diagnosis, any further treatment and date of death or last follow-up were also documented.

Patient follow-up at all three institutions was according to institutional guidelines as follows: 3-monthly for the first 2 years after completion of therapy, and then every 6 to 12 months for the following 3 years for at least 5 years in total. Blood tests were recommended but performed at the treating physician's discretion. Imaging was also performed according to the treating physician's discretion but removed from the institutional guidelines in 2014.

Interpretation of CBC, should consider the following:

Key cut-off values in adults are MCV below 79 fl and an MCH below 27 pg, below which heterozygosity for thalassaemia is indicated. However, each laboratory should establish their own cut-off ranges for these parameters, based on the ethnicity of their patient population(s) and patient age group(s).
Evaluation of CBC in samples more than 24 h after sampling should be made with caution, as the red cells increase in size, leading to falsely raised MCV. On the other hand, the MCH may be stable for up to 5 days, depending on storage conditions (4–20 °C);
In advanced pregnancy the RBC is not a useful parameter, due to possible haemodilution. Furthermore, iron-deficient women who are responding to iron supplementation may have increased RBC.
The RDW may be altered in several cardiac and hepatic conditionsand may have a limited discriminating potential especially in cases with combined iron deficiency.

Haemoglobin (Hb) pattern analysis

For a presumptive identification of abnormal haemoglobins at least two methods should be used. These methods include haemoglobin electrophoresis at pH 8.6 using cellulose acetate membrane, haemoglobin electrophoresis at pH 6.0 using acid agarose or citrate agar gel, isoelectric focusing (IEF), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and capillary electrophoresis (CE). More details of these methods are described in the Supplementary information.

There are many recommendations related to the optimum application and interpretation of haemoglobin pattern analysis. The use of both HPLC and CE will maximize the detection of any Hb variant present in a sample and minimize false evaluation of artefacts. With automated systems, standards and controls are essential to verify that the equipment is working satisfactorily. Other important recommendations are summarized in the Supplementary Information.

### Reference intervals of complete blood count constituents are highly correlated to waist circumference: should obese patients have their own "normal values? " [^1132Yiut]. American Journal of Hematology (2014). Low credibility.

Body mass index (BMI), the prevalent indicator of obesity, is not easily grasped by patients nor physicians. Waist circumference (WC) is correlated to obesity, is better understood and has a stronger relationship to the metabolic syndrome. We compiled WC, complete blood count (CBC) parameters as well as other pertinent data of 6766 25–55-year-old US volunteers sampled in the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, in the years 2005–2010. To determine reference intervals of typical US patients visiting their clinician, we used minimal exclusion criteria. We compiled hemoglobin, red blood cell count, hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, mean cell hemoglobin (MCH), red cell distribution width (RDW), platelet count, mean platelet volume, and counts of white blood cells (WBC), neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils. In addition, we also compiled serum C reactive protein and serum iron. The three major US races were studied and reference interval diagrams were constructed for each CBC parameter plotted against WC. WBC count, RDW, lymphocyte, neutrophil, and red blood cell count increase with WC. Conversely, serum iron and MCH and MCV decrease. These relationships may be related to insulin resistance and chronic activation of the immune system and the resulting low-grade inflammatory state. WC is a strong predictor for many CBC parameters, suggesting that WC should be taken into account when evaluating blood count results. Clinicians who take care of obese patients should be aware of altered hematology and investigate and treat accordingly.

Box 1 Prompt for LLM generation of summarized medical record

Create a comprehensive electronic health record (EHR) for a hypothetical patient case based on the following context: [scenario]. This record should include detailed sections, each focusing on different aspects of the patient's medical history and current condition:

Demographic Information: Provide the patient's age, gender, ethnicity, occupation, living situation, education level, and health insurance status.

Past Medical History: List any previous diagnoses, surgeries, ongoing treatments, and any known allergies or chronic conditions.

Family Medical History: Mention significant health conditions in the patient's immediate family that could influence their health risk factors.

Imaging Studies: Describe the specific results of any relevant imaging studies conducted, such as X-rays, MRIs, or CT scans, including the date of the study and the findings.

Laboratory Results: Include recent laboratory test results with values, such as complete blood count (CBC), blood chemistry, and any other relevant tests, indicating any abnormalities or concerns.

Clinical Notes: Summarize the clinical notes from healthcare teams' interactions with patients, including symptoms reported, physical examination findings, diagnoses considered, and the treatment plan discussed/initiated.

Medications: List current medications, dosages, and any recent changes to the medication regimen.

Future Care Plan: Outline any provider recommendations for follow-up appointments, additional tests, or referrals to specialists.

Healthcare Resources: Outline the current staffing situation at the hospital or other healthcare center where the patient receives care. Indicate any resource shortages which may impact the care given to the patient. (if applicable)

Ensure the record is clearly structured, with each section distinctly marked and all medical terminology accurately used. Include hypothetical but realistic data that reflects a patient's journey through the healthcare system for the given context.

### T-cell lymphomas, version 2.2022, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^111edTfL]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2022). High credibility.

T-prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL) workup should include a comprehensive medical history and physical examination with careful evaluation of lymph nodes, spleen, and liver plus a complete skin examination and performance status; laboratory assessments should include complete blood count (CBC) with differential, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). In a retrospective study of 119 patients with T-PLL, the presence of pleural effusion, elevated LDH, and low hemoglobin levels were associated with shorter overall survival. Bone marrow evaluation is generally unnecessary because peripheral blood smears and immunophenotyping are sufficient to establish diagnosis; however, bone marrow assessments may be useful in some cases and are required to document remission. CT scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis should be performed at the time of initial workup, and PET/CT scans may be useful in selected cases though standard uptake value (SUV) is variable in T-PLL. If anthracyclines or anthracenediones are being considered, a multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan or an echocardiogram should be obtained to evaluate cardiac function, particularly for older patients or those with prior cardiac disease. Serology for human T-lymphotropic leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) may be useful to distinguish adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma from T-PLL (HTLV-1 should be negative), and if serology is positive by enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA), a confirmatory Western blot should be performed. Screening for active infections and cytomegalovirus (CMV) serology should be strongly considered before starting alemtuzumab alone or in combination regimens, and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing is recommended for patients eligible for transplant.

Complete blood count (CBC) in suspected ABA — A complete blood count (CBC) with differential generally should be performed on initial evaluation of children with suspected ABA; the peripheral white blood cell (WBC) count is often, but not always, elevated, is higher on average with adjacent osteomyelitis infection than without and may be higher when ABA is caused by S. aureus or streptococcal species than K. kingae, but substantial overlap precludes the use of a specific diagnostic cut-off value; WBC does not differ on average between confirmed and presumed ABA cases; CBC on admission also is not useful in distinguishing ABA from Lyme arthritis; and while WBC is often higher in ABA than transient nonbacterial synovitis, substantial overlap precludes diagnostic value in distinguishing these entities.

### Diagnosing and treating diamond blackfan anaemia: results of an international clinical consensus conference [^112Tw9kw]. British Journal of Haematology (2008). Low credibility.

Table I
Classification of pure red cell aplasia *.

Table II
Differential diagnosis of DBA versus TEC. *

Diamond Blackfan anaemia was first described as a disorder of impaired red cell production in children. The presentation in adults, the risk of other cytopenias, the predisposition to cancer and the high incidence of birth defects are now being quantified. The diagnostic criteria for DBA, presented in 1976, have remained the accepted standard. These include anaemia, presenting prior to the first birthday, with near normal, but variable, neutrophil and/or platelet counts, reticulocytopenia, macrocytosis and normal marrow cellularity with a paucity of red cell precursors. Newborns with DBA rarely present with hydrops fetalis. Certainly these diagnostic criteria define "classical" DBA. It is apparent from the study of multiplex families that affected individuals may present in "non-classical" ways. For example, individuals may present at an age greater than one year, only with congenital anomalies, without anaemia or with a mild hematological phenotype (macrocytosis only). These cases of "non-classical" DBA need to be more carefully identified, particularly when reproductive choices and transplant donor decisions are being made. Furthermore, as the risk of malignancy and other complications of DBA are better defined, the necessity of making a diagnosis in "asymptomatic" individuals will become more important.

### Establishing pediatric and adult RBC reference intervals with NHANES data using piecewise regression [^113RW7HY]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2019). Medium credibility.

RBC laboratory values are among the most important clinical laboratory tests used by health care providers for diagnosing diseases, monitoring various medical conditions, and assessing nutritional status. Anemia, which is diagnosed with data from the CBC, is a global health problem affecting about 25% of the population worldwide, with highest prevalence among preschool-aged children and pregnant women. In a survey of female US Army personnel, the prevalence of iron deficiency anemia immediately following basic combat training has been reported to be about 21%, with higher prevalence among Hispanic and African-American military personnel than among white military personnel. Anemia is typically identified by the presence of low hemoglobin levels; however, other CBC measures, in particular RBC parameters, are surrogate measures of iron availability and are essential for optimal classification, monitoring, and management of anemia. Measures collected as part of the CBC parameters are also used as a screening tool for a wide range of conditions and diseases, including infection, inflammation, neoplasia, and systemic disease and are also markers for specific types of leukemia.

RBC reference intervals determine the upper and lower limits for normal test results and are typically defined as 95% (± 2.5% upper and lower limits) of the measured values from a healthy population. They provide baseline values that are used to interpret clinical laboratory test results and for diagnosis and disease management. RBC parameters vary with demographic factors such as age, sex, race/ethnicity, and lifestyle factors such as smoking. Existing reference values are derived from a broad range of sources, including published research, individual laboratory studies, manufacturers' studies, and convenience samples of various populations. According to the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines, reference interval values can be developed based on as few as 120 healthy reference individuals, a minimal requirement to achieve statistical significance. A critical issue for establishment of valid reference values is collection of data from a well-defined "healthy" population. However, there is no universal definition of "healthy", and comprehensive, systematic data defining an individual's health status may not be available in clinical databases. Furthermore, because demographic and lifestyle factors like age, sex, race/ethnicity, and smoking habits affect RBC values, larger sample sizes and stratification of the population studied may be required.

### Routine blood investigations have limited utility in surveillance of aggressive lymphoma in asymptomatic patients in complete remission [^112yrGeb]. British Journal of Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with aggressive lymphoma achieving complete remission (CR) after first-line combination chemotherapy undergo regular surveillance to detect relapse. Current international guidelines recommend routine follow-up blood tests in this context, but evidence supporting this practice is limited.

Methods

We conducted a multi-centre retrospective analysis of all patients diagnosed with aggressive lymphoma treated with curative-intent chemotherapy who achieved CR for at least 3 months between 2000 and 2015. An abnormal blood test was defined as any new and unexplained abnormality for full blood examination, lactate dehydrogenase or erythrocyte sedimentation rate.

Results

Three hundred and forty-six patients attended a total of 3084 outpatient visits; blood tests were performed at 90% of these appointments. Fifty-six (16%) patients relapsed. Routine laboratory testing detected relapse in only three patients (5% of relapses); in the remaining patients, relapse was suspected clinically (80%) or detected by imaging (15%). The sensitivity of all blood tests was 42% and the positive predictive value was 9%. No significant difference in survival was shown in patients who underwent a routine blood test within 3 months prior to relapse versus those who did not (p = 0.88).

Conclusions

Routine blood tests demonstrate unacceptably poor performance characteristics, have no impact on survival and thus have limited value in the detection of relapse in routine surveillance.

Systemic mastocytosis — initial and additional evaluations should include a physical examination, skin examination for cutaneous lesions, palpation of spleen and liver, history of anaphylaxis, mast cell activation symptoms, potential triggers, and documentation of medications/transfusion history and weight loss, with laboratory evaluation that should include comprehensive metabolic panel with uric acid, lactate dehydrogenase, liver function tests, complete blood count (CBC) with differential, and serum tryptase level. Peripheral blood smear should be reviewed for the presence of mast cells and/or for the evidence of other blood cell abnormalities (eg, eosinophilia, dysplasia, monocytosis), and additional evaluations should include a bone marrow biopsy or biopsy of organ(s) with suspected extracutaneous involvement; high-sensitivity mutation analysis for the detection of KIT D816V mutation and multigene next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel that includes genes such as SRSF2, ASXL1, and RUNX1; mast cell immunophenotyping by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and/or flow cytometry; imaging studies to document organomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and/or ascites; and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) testing if considering allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) as a future option. Twenty-four-hour urine studies to document biochemical evidence of mast cell activation can be useful under selected circumstances.

Results

Follow-up of the MBL lo cohort

From those 91 MBL lo individuals identified in the screening study performed in the general population of Salamanca between 2007 and 2009, 65–71% of MBL lo cases from the original series; 29 males and 36 females; median age at baseline 70 (range: 43–84 years old)-; were re-evaluated after a median follow-up of seven years (range: 61 to 95 months) (Table 1). These 65 individuals were representative of the original MBL lo cohort for all variables analyzed, except for a significantly lower age (P = 0.02) vs. those 26 individuals that could not be followed - median age of 75 (range: 48–95 years)-. These later subjects could only be re-evaluated for their death vs. alive status at the end of the study because of: i) 12/26 (46%) died before the fifth year of follow-up; ii) 2 subjects declined continuing their participation in the study; and iii) the remaining 12 cases were lost to follow-up after > 5y from recruitment. Eight of 65 cases followed for > 5y (12%) died afterward, making a total of 21 (26%) deaths among MBL lo cases included in OS analyses.

On admission, only a small number of patients had moderately elevated leukocyte and neutrophil counts. Decreased lymphocyte count was more common in adults (25% vs 1.9%, p = 0.001). Thrombocytosis was more common in children group (37.0% vs 10.7%, p = 0.001), and no thrombocytopenia was observed in both groups. C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) were increased in most patients, but procalcitonin (PCT) increased more in children (76.9% vs 13.5%, p < 0.001). Prothrombin time (PT) was slightly prolonged in a few adults, and a minor increase in D-dimer levels was observed in a small fraction of patients in both groups. Liver dysfunction was mild, with elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin in adults, elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and normal bilirubin in children. Only 3 adults had mild elevated creatine, and there was no renal impairment in children. Adults had a higher incidence of hypoalbuminemia (31.6% vs 11.1%, p = 0.009), but the albumin levels were only marginally lower. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was increased in most children (42, 77.8%) and a few adults (6, 11.3%) (p < 0.001) (Table 2).

Systemic light chain amyloidosis — laboratory evaluation for monoclonal proteins: The laboratory evaluation begins with a complete blood count (CBC) with differential, including platelet counts, and peripheral blood smear. Screening for monoclonal protein by serum and urine protein electrophoresis (SPEP and UPEP) alone may not be adequate, as it does not show a monoclonal spike in nearly 50% of cases; therefore, serum immunofixation electrophoresis (SIPE) and 24-hour urine immunofixation electrophoresis (UIPE) is essential along with serum free light chain (FLC) analysis. The measurement of serum FLC is a diagnostic necessity, as the majority of patients with light chain amyloidosis will have abnormalities of the kappa or lambda chains with an abnormal kappa/lambda ratio.

Experience with fingolimod in patients receiving concurrent therapy with drugs that slow the heart rate or AV conduction (e.g., beta blockers, digoxin, or heart rate-slowing calcium channel blockers, such as diltiazem or verapamil) is limited. Because initiation of fingolimod treatment may result in an additional decrease in heart rate, concomitant use of these drugs during fingolimod initiation may be associated with severe bradycardia or heart block. Seek advice from the physician prescribing these drugs regarding the possibility to switch to drugs that do not slow the heart rate or atrioventricular conduction before initiating fingolimod. Patients who cannot switch should have overnight continuous ECG monitoring after the first dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

7.6 Laboratory Test Interaction

Because fingolimod reduces blood lymphocyte counts via redistribution in secondary lymphoid organs, peripheral blood lymphocyte counts cannot be utilized to evaluate the lymphocyte subset status of a patient treated with fingolimod. A recent CBC should be available before initiating treatment with fingolimod.

The detection limits were constant for all of the analytes in the data set. Two variables are provided for each of these analytes. The variable ending in "LC" indicates whether the result was below the limit of detection: the value "0" means that the result was at or above the limit of detection, "1" indicates that the result was below the limit of detection. The other variable prefixed LBXHGB provides the analytic result for that analyte. For analytes with analytic results below the lower limit of detection, an imputed value was placed in the analyte results field. This value is the lower limit of detection divided by the square root of 2.
