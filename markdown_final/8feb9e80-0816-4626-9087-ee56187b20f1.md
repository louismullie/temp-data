Rose bush thorns

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about rose thorn injuries, including the classic sporotrichosis, other infectious complications, ocular and joint injuries, and prevention strategies. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the classic entity of sporotrichosis and its epidemiology and pathophysiology. Then, I should verify alternative infectious etiologies that can follow thorn inoculation. Next, I will examine noninfectious complications such as ocular and synovial injuries. After that, I need to consider special populations and diagnostic pitfalls. Finally, I will synthesize prevention and management recommendations and close with a concise clinical takeaway, making sure each point is supported by appropriate references.

> Let me first confirm the classic entity: sporotrichosis, historically termed "rose gardener's disease", is a subacute to chronic infection caused by Sporothrix schenckii, a dimorphic fungus that transitions from environmental mold to yeast at body temperature and is classically inoculated via minor plant trauma such as rose thorn pricks, with lymphocutaneous spread being typical and incubation ranging from about 1 to 12 weeks, which aligns with the clinical lore and contemporary summaries from CDC and dermatology reviews [^113gn24u] [^112Js3R5].

> Wait, let me verify the epidemiology and risk framing before I overstate it: in the United States, most human cases are linked to plant exposures rather than zoonotic transmission, whereas in parts of South America, cat-associated sporotrichosis due to Sporothrix brasiliensis predominates, so I should be careful to distinguish regional patterns when counseling patients about risk sources and prevention [^113gn24u].

> I will now examine the clinical course to ensure I'm precise: the cutaneous form typically begins as a painless papule at the inoculation site and evolves into nodular or ulcerative lesions that may drain, with subsequent nodules appearing along lymphatic channels; disseminated disease is uncommon in immunocompetent hosts but more likely in immunocompromised patients, which is why I need to ask about immune status and comorbidities up front [^112Js3R5] [^1138mA7h].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions that every thorn injury equals sporotrichosis; I should review alternative infectious etiologies that can follow plant inoculation, including Pantoea agglomerans, which has been isolated from synovial fluid in thorn-related synovitis and is a recognized pathogen in neonatal outbreaks linked to plant material, and Burkholderia fungorum, which has been implicated in delayed granulomatous infection after rose thorn puncture, reminding me to broaden the microbiologic differential when cultures are negative or the course is atypical [^1136bpHS] [^1172vuUr].

> Let me consider other environmental fungi as well: plant-associated fungi such as Phomopsis can cause keratitis after thorn injury to the cornea, and eumycetoma pathogens like Fusarium falciforme can be introduced via thorn pricks, producing chronic granulomatous disease with grain formation; these entities underscore the need for fungal cultures and, when needed, molecular identification when routine cultures fail to recover an organism [^112NzMm5] [^115tPK8C] [^111bPvve].

> Next, I should review noninfectious complications, particularly ocular injuries, because rose thorns can penetrate ocular structures and cause sight-threatening disease; deeply embedded thorns can precipitate corneal perforation and anterior chamber collapse, and large plant foreign bodies with thorny surfaces can lodge in the conjunctival fornix or subconjunctival space, masquerading as conjunctivitis until careful slit-lamp examination reveals the culprit, so I need to maintain a high index of suspicion for retained plant material in persistent ocular irritation [^1124muW4] [^112bMhPa] [^1166wv1K].

> I should double-check joint-related pathology too: plant thorn synovitis is a recognized entity in which intra-articular foreign material triggers sterile or occasionally infected synovitis; Pantoea agglomerans is the most commonly reported organism in culture-positive cases, and management typically requires arthroscopic removal of foreign bodies and synovectomy with empiric gram-negative coverage until cultures return, so I must not assume aseptic inflammation in a thorn-related effusion [^1136bpHS] [^116duV1E].

> But wait, what if the patient is a child or an immunocompromised host; I need to ensure I tailor counseling and follow-up accordingly: neonatal sporotrichosis has been reported even without recalled trauma, and fixed cutaneous lesions on the face are relatively more common in children, while disseminated disease risk rises with immunosuppression, so I should ask about gardening, animal exposures, and immune status to guide both diagnostic testing and treatment thresholds [^113xRgzE] [^112Js3R5].

> Let me think about diagnostic pitfalls and mimics so I don't anchor on sporotrichosis: a sporotrichoid distribution can be seen in nontuberculous mycobacterial infection, leishmaniasis, and even hematologic malignancies such as leukemia cutis, so tissue culture, histopathology with fungal stains, and, when indicated, molecular testing should be pursued for persistent or atypical cases rather than empirically treating without etiologic confirmation [^115tfyan] [^113rcyM7].

> I should confirm prevention messaging grounded in One Health principles: in endemic regions, wearing gloves and long sleeves during gardening, promptly cleansing and monitoring minor plant wounds, and avoiding high-risk plant exposures reduce sporotrichosis risk; for cat-associated risk regions, keeping cats indoors and seeking prompt veterinary care for feline skin lesions mitigates zoonotic transmission, and these messages should be individualized to local epidemiology and patient activities [^113gn24u] [^111qytGJ].

> Next, I should review management principles and make sure I align with current practice: for uncomplicated cutaneous sporotrichosis, itraconazole is first-line therapy with treatment continued for several months until clinical resolution; for severe or disseminated disease, amphotericin B may be required initially, and in ocular or joint disease, early involvement of ophthalmology or orthopedics for foreign body removal and targeted therapy is essential to prevent permanent damage [^112Js3R5] [^112NzMm5] [^1136bpHS].

> Hold on, I should verify that I've integrated the key takeaways succinctly: rose thorn injuries are not trivial and can seed diverse infections and cause mechanical injury; sporotrichosis remains the classic but not exclusive concern, Pantoea and other gram-negatives can complicate joints, plant fungi can threaten vision, and retained foreign bodies can perpetuate inflammation; prevention hinges on protective gear, wound care, and awareness of regional risk patterns, while diagnosis relies on tissue sampling with fungal stains and culture, with molecular methods when needed, and management combines pathogen-directed therapy with removal of retained material to optimize outcomes [^113gn24u] [^1136bpHS] [^112NzMm5] [^115tPK8C].

Rose thorns can cause **puncture wounds** that carry bacteria and fungi into the skin, leading to infections such as sporotrichosis ("rose gardener's disease") [^113gn24u], **Pantoea agglomerans** synovitis [^1136bpHS], and other plant-borne pathogens [^112NyxTG]. Injuries may also cause **foreign-body reactions**, tenosynovitis, or ocular trauma if thorns lodge in the eye [^1124muW4] [^1166wv1K]. Prompt irrigation, debridement, and tetanus prophylaxis are essential; persistent or atypical lesions warrant fungal or bacterial cultures and imaging for retained fragments [^1136bpHS] [^1172vuUr]. Prevention includes wearing gloves, long sleeves, and eye protection when handling roses, and thoroughly cleaning any puncture wounds [^notfound].

---

## Clinical significance of rose thorn injuries

Rose thorn injuries are clinically significant because they can introduce pathogenic microorganisms into the **subcutaneous tissue**, causing localized or systemic infections [^112Js3R5]. The most common infections associated with rose thorn injuries include:

- **Sporotrichosis**: A fungal infection caused by Sporothrix schenckii, commonly found in soil, decaying vegetation, and rose bushes. It typically presents as a localized skin lesion that may ulcerate and spread along lymphatic channels (lymphocutaneous sporotrichosis) [^112Js3R5] [^113gn24u].

- **Pantoea agglomerans infection**: A Gram-negative bacterium that can cause localized infections, including synovitis and septic arthritis, particularly in immunocompromised individuals [^1136bpHS].

- **Other bacterial infections**: Rose thorn injuries can also introduce other bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus species, and Burkholderia fungorum, leading to localized abscesses, cellulitis, or systemic infections [^1172vuUr].

---

## Pathophysiology of rose thorn injuries

Rose thorn injuries typically involve **puncture wounds** that breach the skin barrier, allowing microorganisms to enter the subcutaneous tissue. The thorns can also introduce foreign material (e.g. plant debris, dirt), further increasing the risk of infection and inflammatory reactions. The pathophysiology of rose thorn injuries includes:

- **Direct inoculation of microorganisms**: Thorns carry microorganisms from the environment (soil, plants) into the wound, initiating infection [^112Js3R5].

- **Foreign body reaction**: Retained thorn fragments can provoke a chronic inflammatory response, leading to granuloma formation, chronic synovitis, or tenosynovitis [^116duV1E].

- **Mechanical tissue damage**: Thorns can cause direct injury to tendons, joints, and other structures, leading to functional impairment and chronic pain [^1136bpHS].

---

## Clinical manifestations and complications

Rose thorn injuries can cause a range of **clinical manifestations and complications**, including:

| **Clinical manifestation** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Localized skin infection | - Erythema <br/> - Swelling <br/> - Warmth <br/> - Purulent discharge <br/> - Abscess formation [^notfound] |
| Lymphocutaneous sporotrichosis | - Nodular lesions along lymphatic channels <br/> - Ulceration <br/> - Chronic course [^112Js3R5] |
| Septic arthritis | - Joint swelling <br/> - Pain <br/> - Redness <br/> - Limited range of motion <br/> - Particularly affecting the hands and wrists [^1136bpHS] |
| Tenosynovitis | - Inflammation of tendon sheaths <br/> - Pain <br/> - Swelling <br/> - Restricted movement [^notfound] |
| Foreign body granuloma | - Chronic inflammatory reaction around retained thorn fragments <br/> - Granuloma formation <br/> - Persistent swelling [^1172vuUr] |
| Ocular injury | - Corneal abrasion <br/> - Corneal perforation <br/> - Endophthalmitis <br/> - Vision loss [^1124muW4] |

---

## Diagnostic approaches

Accurate diagnosis of rose thorn injuries and their complications requires a combination of **clinical evaluation, microbiological testing, and imaging studies**:

- **Clinical evaluation**: Detailed history of exposure to rose thorns, clinical examination of the wound, and assessment of systemic symptoms [^112Js3R5].

- **Microbiological testing**: Culture and sensitivity testing of wound discharge or tissue samples to identify causative microorganisms (bacteria, fungi) [^115tPK8C].

- **Imaging studies**: X-rays, ultrasound, or MRI may be necessary to detect retained foreign bodies, joint involvement, or osteomyelitis [^117DZnij].

---

## Treatment strategies

Treatment of rose thorn injuries depends on the **severity and type of complication**:

- **Local wound care**: Thorough irrigation, debridement, and tetanus prophylaxis are essential for all puncture wounds [^notfound].

- **Antibiotic therapy**: Empirical antibiotic treatment targeting Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria may be initiated, with adjustments based on culture results [^1136bpHS].

- **Antifungal therapy**: Itraconazole is the treatment of choice for sporotrichosis, with treatment duration ranging from several months to a year, depending on the severity of infection [^notfound].

- **Surgical intervention**: Surgical exploration and removal of retained foreign bodies, synovectomy, or joint lavage may be necessary in cases of chronic synovitis, tenosynovitis, or septic arthritis [^116duV1E].

---

## Preventive measures

Preventing rose thorn injuries and their complications involves:

- **Protective clothing**: Wearing gloves, long sleeves, and eye protection when handling rose bushes or gardening [^notfound].

- **Proper wound care**: Immediate cleaning and disinfection of puncture wounds, along with prompt medical attention if signs of infection develop [^notfound].

- **Public education**: Raising awareness about the risks associated with rose thorn injuries and the importance of preventive measures [^111qytGJ].

---

Rose thorn injuries can cause significant morbidity due to infections and inflammatory complications. Prompt recognition, appropriate diagnostic evaluation, and timely treatment are essential to prevent chronic disability and systemic complications.

### Public health in the time of bioterrorism [^114U67an]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

The decision-making involved in closing the U.S. Postal Service's Brentwood Processing and Distribution Facility, Washington, D.C. has been criticized. The risk to Brentwood facility employees by contaminated envelopes in transit was not recognized in time to prevent illness in four employees, two of whom died. Decisions concerning the Brentwood facility were based on epidemiologic observations in Florida and New York, where no disease occurred among postal workers. A possible explanation for the differential risk is that the B. anthracis spore preparation in the October 9 envelopes had a higher potential for aerosolization than the preparation in the September 18 envelopes or that the two mailings were made under or exposed to different environmental conditions (e.g. amount of moisture) that created a different potential for aerosolization. A different aerosolization potential is supported by the epidemic curve in the manuscript by Jernigan et al. which shows a higher proportion of inhalational (versus cutaneous) anthrax cases associated with the October 9 mailing. In naturally occurring disease, once risk is understood, it generally remains constant; however, in intentional contamination, risk may be altered by the perpetrator(s).

During the anthrax investigation, the public health response team was better prepared in some areas than in others. Five deaths were not prevented, but widespread illness and death was averted through early recognition of threats and prompt intervention. We applied what we knew and learned what we did not know. We gained new appreciation for communication and partnerships. For the first time, on November 8, 2001, a sitting President of the United States of America, George W. Bush, visited CDC to support the efforts of public health professionals and others who participated in the anthrax investigation and response. Leaders and individual heroes rose in the ranks of public health, clinical medicine, and law enforcement. The substantial role of public health in the 2001 anthrax investigation and response suggests that strong public health infrastructure supported by applied public health and basic-science research are key elements to the control and prevention of future bioterrorism threats.

### Association between population mean and distribution of deviance in demographic surveys from 65 countries: cross sectional study [^117W7ne8]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

For prevention

In his broader body of work, Rose was remarkably forward thinking in advocating a population strategy for prevention. He criticised the traditional preventive strategy in public health for being focused only on the right sided tail and missing the importance of shifting average population levels. His theories galvanised the public health community, emphasising the need to think of health at the population level. In the nearly 30 years since his death, increasing evidence has shown that the distributions of some population metrics such as BMI are pulling apart, and underweight and anaemia in low and middle income countries are important examples of situations where focusing on the tails may be of critical importance to enhance equity and improve population health. The determinants of these conditions of scarcity are profoundly different than conditions of excess such as obesity and high cholesterol, and a single population strategy focused on the mean would not be plausible or effective. Emerging evidence around the change in height distributions over the past half century indicates a near complete dissociation between mean changes and dispersion, providing another example of how mean changes may be an insufficient measure of population change. These are examples of human risk factor distributions at odds with the shared underlying cause and preserved distributional widths of risk factors that Rose and Day were examining. They are unlikely to have argued for a focus on the mean given these findings. The potential for "vulnerable populations" has been discussed previously in an exploration of how Rose's population strategy may widen disparities, and this analysis provides empirical evidence for the phenomena of a left behind population in an observational setting.

### Practices and perspectives on latrine use, child feces disposal, and clean play environments in Western Kenya [^111Cz9Ax]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

Safe and clean play environment.

Defining a safe and clean play environment.

Caregivers expressed the importance of keeping children safe while playing. When defining "clean" play environments for children, caregivers related similar terms and ideas that they used to describe "safe" environments. Generally, the term "safe" was defined as absence of immediate potential harms to a child, such as thorns, bushes, sticks, tall grass, stones, holes in the ground, bodies of water, broken bottles, snakes, smoke from cooking, fire, and latrines. Latrines and water, especially standing water or runoff, were perceived to pose a threat to illness.

There is still some surface run off flowing here… Sometimes they [the children] go and mess themselves in that water in the name of playing… that water will get them sick. (Mother)

### Bartonella henselae in porpoise blood [^1145r9XH]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Recently, various emerging or reemerging infectious diseases or infections of serious epizootic or zoonotic potential have been described in marine mammals. These include morbillivirus infection, brucellosis, toxoplasmosis, sarcocystosis, papillomavirus infection, and West Nile virus infection. As was the case for brucellosis, recognized as an emerging disease in a marine mammal in 1994, bartonellosis may become an important emerging marine mammal infectious disease.

Current evidence indicates that all known Bartonella species are vector transmitted, with bites or scratches (cat scratch disease) providing an alternative means of transmission for B. henselae. The B. henselae SA2 sequence deposited in GenBank was amplified from an isolate derived from a human lymph node aspiration sample. Although exposed to rose thorns and cats, the patient did not recall an animal bite or scratch, and illness developed after a recent tick bite, which was attributed to Amblyomma americanum, based on the location and time of the year. Since the mode of infection was not established in these porpoises, the potential role of trauma, such as induced by tooth raking, or transmission via biting marine invertebrates should be investigated.

Patient demographics in study of clinical manifestations, antifungal drug susceptibility, and treatment outcomes for emerging zoonotic cutaneous sporotrichosis, Thailand*

*Values are no. patients/total no. patients (%) except as indicated. IQR, interquartile range. †Other occupations included teacher, monk, and boat driver.

Figure 1
Numbers of sporotrichosis cases during 2018–2022 in study of clinical manifestations, antifungal drug susceptibility, and treatment outcomes for emerging zoonotic cutaneous sporotrichosis, Thailand. Line indicates the total number of cases each year. Numbers above each bar indicate the number of patients exposed or not exposed to cats.

Thirty-five (71.4%) patients reported a history of animal exposure; 32 had been exposed to cats and 3 to insects. Of the 3 patients with insect bites, 2 had bites from mosquitoes and 1 had an unidentified insect bite. For all 3 patients, lesions developed later on the lower extremities at the sites of those insect bites. Among the patients exposed to cats, 23 had direct contact, and 22 (95.7%) of those 23 reported scratches or bites (Table 2). Most (27/32) patients exposed to cats had contact with their own cats, and all let their cats roam outdoors. In addition, 21 (65%) patients had been in direct contact with cats that had sporotrichosis diagnosed by a veterinarian. Although 15 (30.6%) patients were retired or unemployed, 4 (8.2%) patients were employed in veterinary professions; 2 were veterinarians and 2 veterinary assistants. All 4 of those patients were scratched or bitten by cats that had sporotrichosis. Only 2/49 (4.1%) patients had a history of gardening, and none reported exposure to rose thorns. One patient reported falling from a bicycle onto soil causing an abrasion wound on his left leg, which later developed into lymphocutaneous lesions. Sporotrichosis developed in 13/49 (26.5%) patients who had no recognized risk factors.

### Regulation profiles of e-cigarettes in the United States: a critical review with qualitative synthesis [^113hrEgv]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

A useful lens through which to consider how to mitigate the potential harms associated with e-cigarette use is Geoffrey Rose's model of high-risk versus population prevention. High-risk strategies target groups for whom intervention offers the greatest benefit by reducing their exposure to a possible cause of harm. For instance, minors may constitute a high-risk group that is more vulnerable to nicotine addiction relative to adults. Regulations that limit youth exposure to the product could therefore restrict minors' access to and use of e-cigarettes. Typically, high-risk strategies are relatively politically palatable as they avoid impinging upon the freedoms of those deemed to be at a lower risk. Such public favor likely accounts for the frequency of youth-targeted interventions across states. However, an important limitation of high-risk strategies is their failure to address the social determinants that encourage behaviors such as nicotine consumption, or vaping.

An alternative to a high-risk strategy is a population approach to prevention, which aims to minimize the barriers preventing people from making healthier choices. This comparatively radical strategy is typically enforced through comprehensive multi-level regulations, including bans on product sales or use. Population prevention targets social norms in the aim of modifying the acceptability of a potentially harmful product in society. Because this approach often takes the form of broad-spanning legislation undermining personal freedoms, population prevention may fall into disfavor for its perceived paternalism. Accordingly, few states have implemented population prevention strategies aimed at restricting the public availability and use of e-cigarettes.

Ultimately, e-cigarette regulations should be devised on the merits of their suitability and feasibility, taking into account the existing regulatory framework in a given state or country. A recent report drafted by the WHO outlined some primary objectives governments should bear in mind when drafting regulation for e-cigarettes. These include restricting e-cigarette uptake by vulnerable groups or non-smokers, and minimizing potential health risks to users and non-users. To this effect, the WHO recommends that countries consider prohibiting unproven health claims about e-cigarettes, banning the use of e-cigarettes in indoor public places, restricting e-cigarette advertising, promotion and sponsorship, standardizing product design, enforcing the display of health warnings on packaging, as well as prohibiting sale to minors. As the proposed US federal regulations only touch upon some of these concerns, states will likely continue to implement complementary regulations to address potential shortcomings.

### Cutaneousinfection in an immunocompetent woman [^116kJmM4]. JAAD Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

The presence of fungal hyphae in the dermis engenders a differential diagnosis including aspergillosis, fusariosis, alternariosis, and mucormycosis. The hyphae of mucor organisms show relatively unique features, but often a culture is the only means for elucidating the offending organism. Cryptococcosis, blastomycosis, histoplasmosis, candidiasis and phaeohyphomycoses would be expected to demonstrate almost exclusively spores and not hyphae. Sporotrichosis is probably the closest mimic to our patient's condition in that few fungal organisms would be expected on histologic evaluation, the infection is associated with rose thorn sticks, and the infection is usually seen in otherwise healthy people. Given that patients with deep fungal infections are often gravely ill, systemic antifungal medications are almost always indicated, including aggressive agents such as amphotericin B, voriconazole, and posaconazole.

Treatment of Y lipolytica infections is somewhat controversial given the few cases reported and lack of any clear-cut evidence for appropriate antimicrobial therapy. Because many cases are associated with infected intravenous catheters, simply removing these devices may prove sufficient to clear the infection. However, therapy with oral or intravenous azole antifungals, as in our patient, is typically curative.

### Case report: subacute synovitis of the knee after a rose thorn injury: unusual clinical picture [^1136bpHS]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2008). Low credibility.

Synovitis secondary to penetrating plant thorn injuries is not frequently reported. Historically, it is considered aseptic and treated with removal of the intraarticular foreign body and affected synovial lining. We report a 57-year-old healthy man who was admitted 2 weeks after being injured by a rose (Rosacea) thorn with subacute and mild synovitis with effusion of his right knee. No intraarticular foreign body was retained. Pantoea agglomerans was identified in the synovial fluid. Contrary to former teaching, effusions from joints violated by thorns should not be presumed sterile. Bacterial growth is reported infrequently, but when reported, Pantoea agglomerans is the most common organism found. We recommend removal of foreign bodies if present, arthroscopic total synovectomy, and beginning empiric antibiotic treatment with coverage against gram-negative enteric pathogens in all cases of thorn synovitis until the results of culture specimens are known. Improved physician awareness can result in more rapid diagnosis and improved clinical outcome in affected individuals.

### Future of families: cardiovascular health among young adults cohort study: rationale, key questions, study design, and participant characteristics [^112hsEhm]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Potential Impact on Public Health and Precision Medicine Strategies

CVD remains the leading cause of death and disability for adults in the United States, and, with current trends, the United States will spend > $1.8 trillion annually on care of CVD by 2050.CVD and its risk factors disproportionately affect minoritized and lower socioeconomic status segments of the US population. Data in adults point to a critical role played by early‐life social and environmental factors, particularly for vulnerable populations, in loss of CVH, development of risk factors and subclinical CVD, and ultimately, development of clinical CVD, but such data are retrospective and limited. The FF‐CHAYA study provides a novel lens through which to examine the prospective effects of social and environmental adversity on CVH from childhood into young adulthood. By examining the key drivers of the loss of CVH, new strategies and areas of focus may be elucidated for community and public health interventions in parents and children. The focus on molecular mechanisms by which social determinants may "get under the skin" to influence health trajectories may also identify new pathways for intervention at the individual patient level to enhance resilience to childhood adversity. Given the burden of cardiometabolic risk factors and CVD in individuals and the population, both of these strategies will likely be needed, to address "sick populations" and "sick individuals", as suggested by Rose.

Conclusions

The FF‐CHAYA study directly addresses numerous recent calls from governmental and public health organizations to understand and address the social determinants of CVH early in life, promote CVH across the lifespan, and enhance resilience. It also will provide unique insights into the potential mechanistic role played by epigenetics in health disparities. Through linkage of social, genetic, physiologic, and preclinical measures we can gain novel perspectives on the social determinants of CVH before early adulthood, and into the potential mechanisms mediating loss of CVH, particularly in vulnerable subgroups that bear a disproportionate burden of CVD. We anticipate identifying critical areas for clinical and population health policies, and potential targets for interventional studies in individuals and groups at risk for loss of CVH.

### Sick individuals, sick populations revisited: a test of the rose hypothesis for type 2 diabetes disparities [^113Cf8zF]. BMJ Public Health (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

In his seminal 1985 paper 'Sick individuals and sick populations', epidemiologist Geoffrey Arthur Rose CBE considered whether and how the causes of individual disease cases relate to the causes of population disease disparities. He regarded these as two distinct issues and fundamental to epidemiological inquiry. The concept of variation was central to Rose's question. He pointed out that relative risk, that is, the relative disease risk of exposed versus non-exposed individuals, was a mainstay of epidemiological studies, and he stressed that the elucidation of relative risk requires variation in exposure levels. By way of example, Rose explained that if everyone smoked 20 cigarettes a day, neither case–control nor cohort studies would find an association between smoking and lung cancer. In other words, interindividual variation in smoking (the exposure) is prerequisite for an association with lung cancer (the outcome) via relative risk calculations.

Variation was equally important to the distinction that Rose made between risk factors for individual disease cases versus risk factors for population disease disparities. He hypothesised that exposures that varied more within than between populations should be associated with individual disease cases, whereas exposures that varied more between than within populations should be associated with population disease disparities. Rose's hypothesis about the variance of exposures (ie, disease risk factors) made corollary predictions regarding the relative contributions of genetic (nature) versus environmental (nurture) risk factors to individual disease cases and population disparities. He predicted that (1) since genetic variation is much greater within than between populations, genetic risk factors should be associated with individual cases but not population disparities, and (2) since environmental exposure variation is much greater between than within populations, environmental risk factors should be associated with population disparities but not individual cases.

### The efficiency of cardiovascular risk assessment: do the right patients get statin treatment? [^114CbKja]. Heart (2013). Low credibility.

Ideal approach to targeting of statins

The real purpose of screening and risk assessment programmes, according to Geoffrey Rose, is to identify those people in whom the intervention offers the most benefit. It is not to categorise people according to their overall risk but rather to identify those who can be helped by preventive action. Several criteria have been proposed to assess the appropriateness of risk assessment programmes for primary prevention, including the need for evidence from randomised trials that the programme improves morbidity. Most randomised trials in primary prevention selected patients based on increased cholesterol or LDL levels rather than baseline CVD risk as determined by a risk score by GPs. The long-term effects of a risk assessment programme should also be measured. The lowering of treatment thresholds for CVD risk, as recently proposed, would lead to younger people being treated. As many patients stop statin treatment within a few years (and may be unlikely to start again at a later date), there should be evidence that early treatment allows for improved health outcomes beyond what might be achieved through later treatment. Cluster randomised trials could be conducted to compare different strategies to target statin treatment. Practices could be randomised to different strategies, and the effects can then be measured at low cost using the routinely collected electronic healthcare records. Randomisation with systematic data collection is the most rational and ethical way to resolve uncertainties. The clinical usefulness of these risk scores should ultimately be established on their potential for improving health outcomes. However, it is unlikely that such trials can easily be conducted. Bradford Hill said that interventions must be evaluated when they are first introduced, as once they are established, RCTs become difficult or impossible.

### The contribution of mycetoma grains to suboptimal disease management [^111bPvve]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Causative microorganisms environmental reservoirs

The primary causative organisms are ubiquitously distributed in the environment in their environmental niches. Molecular studies have detected their DNA in soil, plant material (e.g. thorns, Acacia spines), animal dung, and even in the structural components of dwellings in endemic areas. These findings highlight the pervasive exposure risk associated with normal daily activities, particularly in agrarian communities.

However, isolating viable cultures from environmental samples has proven challenging, likely due to factors such as microbial dormancy, non-culturable states, or competition with faster-growing contaminants.

Few earlier investigations successfully cultured Madurella mycetomatis from soil and anthills –, suggesting that specific microenvironments, such as termite mounds with stable humidity and organic matter, as well as different plants, may favour fungal proliferation and serve as potential vectors. Nevertheless, the absence of sequencing confirmation in these studies leaves room for uncertainty regarding species specificity, emphasising the need for molecular validation in future research.

### Effects of rose hip intake on risk markers of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease: a randomized, double-blind, cross-over investigation in obese persons [^114U818C]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2012). Low credibility.

Several previous studies have demonstrated that the dietary administration of rose hip to individuals with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis exerts anti-inflammatory effects. Obesity and its associated diseases are considered to be states of low-grade inflammation. However, we were unable to detect any significant differences with regard to two markers of systemic inflammation, that is, CRP and PAI-I, or with regard to adiponectin, an adipokine with anti-inflammatory as well as insulin-sensitizing effects. Possibly the most obvious explanation for the lack of effect on these markers is that the low inflammatory tonus of our participants, shown by levels of CRP and PAI-I within the normal range, makes it difficult to demonstrate anti-inflammatory actions, at least as effects on these markers of inflammation.

Although the mechanisms whereby rose hip lowers systolic blood pressure and plasma cholesterol levels remain unresolved, the findings of this study may have important health implications. The current study could be the starting point for exploring rose hip as a constituent of food portfolios aimed at reducing cholesterol and blood pressure, and thereby decrease the risk of coronary heart disease and mortality. Efficient food portfolios are urgently needed and they represent an attractive alternative to statin treatment for people that, because of muscle pain and increases in liver and muscle enzymes, do not tolerate statins, as well as for people at risk of developing diabetes, as statins recently were shown to increase the risk of diabetes.

Food portfolios designed to lower plasma cholesterol typically contain soy, nuts or almonds, viscous fiber and plant sterols. It would be of interest to explore the potential additive and synergistic effects of rose hip in such portfolios. Follow-up studies of dietary treatment with rose hip should not only be performed in hyperlipidemic and hypertensive individuals in order to study its potency in lowering cholesterol and blood pressure in more detail, but also in diabetic individuals in order to further explore its possible antidiabetic effects.

Finally, since many of the underlying causes of stroke and CVD are well established, identifiable, and controllable, 42, 43, 44 according to Rose, 1 there is not a major role for the "high‐risk" strategy for primary prevention of stroke and CVD, but more a complementary role to the more powerful population strategy.

We are not advocating that screening for CVD risk be abandoned but that the "high‐risk" approach should not be the prime focus of public health policy for primary stroke and CVD prevention. It should be used as an adjunct to the population‐wide strategies and primarily for early detection of established risk factors, 45 objective monitoring of progress of individuals in controlling their risk of CVD, and for determining thresholds for the pharmacological management and its intensity at the physician and individual level (eg, blood pressure and lipid‐lowering medicines, aspirin). 46, 47, 48, 49, 50 In addition, to be widely used, such screening should be simple and inexpensive. For example, integrating screening for hypertension into routine medical examinations and related coverage by health insurance was recently recommended as a potentially cost‐effective tool for CVD prevention in Vietnam. 51 Although recently there were concerns raised as to the low applicability of the thresholds for pharmacological treatments in resource‐poor countries, 52 there is a danger of medicalization instead of focusing on lifestyle risk factor control. 53 Health resources are too scarce to waste on proven ineffective and expensive screening strategies (that are not coupled with appropriate intervention) and, given the already huge and increasing stroke and CVD burden, 6 the importance of the use of effective population‐wide primary stroke and CVD prevention strategies cannot be underestimated.

### An evidence map for social and structural determinants for maternal morbidity and mortality: a systematic review [^115JFweF]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). Medium credibility.

SOURCES

The methods for this systematic review followed the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Methods Guide for Effectiveness and Comparative Effectiveness Reviews, modified for risk factor research. We report in accordance with PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) and the ROSES (Reporting Standards for Systematic Evidence Syntheses) flow diagram. The final protocol was posted online on December 9, 2021. Additional review details, including our risk of bias assessment tool, can be found as part of the full systematic review posted on the AHRQ and Pathways to Prevention websites (prevention.nih.gov/P2P-PostpartumHealth). Our key questions were, 1) From a pregnant person's potential entry into prenatal care, what combinations of risk indicators have the greatest prediction of poor postpartum health outcomes? And 2) Immediately before or immediately after delivery and before release from birthing-related hospitalization or clinical care, what combinations of risk indicators to the birthing person have the greatest prediction of poor postpartum health outcomes?

### Synovial tissue infection with Burkholderia fungorum [^1172vuUr]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Recently, B. fungorum was detected in a granuloma specimen from a 26-year-old patient. The bacteria were suspected to have been transmitted to the patient through a rose thorn puncture. Swelling did not appear until 3 years after the initial puncture, and the patient did not report pain or fever and was otherwise healthy. Although the clinical implication of B. fungorum infection remained unclear, recent cases seem to suggest that the bacteria can induce fever in young children and has a lengthy incubation period before erupting.

We suspect that the patient reported here acquired B. fungorum during his initial injury, perhaps from the environment. The concurrent isolation of M. amorphae, a plant bacterium, is consistent with possible environmental origin of the infection. Our observations and those reported earlier suggest the ability of B. fungorum to act as a slowly replicating opportunistic pathogen associated with tissue injuries. The slow replication rate of B. fungorum presumably mimics the growth characteristic of Burkholderia mallei, essential for the bacterium's survival, proliferation, and evasion of host adaptive immune responses. Our findings suggest that an approach combining culture, 16S rDNA sequencing, and multilocus sequence typing be considered for the accurate identification of uncommon bacterial infection.

### Cutaneousinfection in an immunocompetent woman [^117DZnij]. JAAD Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Case report

A 63-year-old white woman with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and hypertension presented to the Vanderbilt University Medical Center Emergency Department with a nonhealing wound on the tip of her right third finger. She had pierced the end of this finger on a rose bush thorn 6 weeks prior. An orthopedic surgeon removed the thorn under local anesthesia and prescribed a course of an unknown antibiotic. Her chronic obstructive pulmonary disease subsequently worsened, and she was hospitalized for pneumonia and treated with ceftriaxone and azithromycin. Systemic corticosteroids were not administered. At hospital discharge, amoxicillin-clavulanate and azithromycin were prescribed. Because the finger wound failed to heal, her family physician suggested she go to the emergency department.

On the tip of her right third finger was a 1.5-cm brown-black, well-demarcated eschar with minimal surrounding erythema or swelling (Fig 1). Satellite lesions and lymphadenopathy were absent. Her white blood cell count, sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein values were all elevated. Given the concern for an infectious process from microbes such as Sporothrix schenkii and Candida parapsilosis, a punch biopsy was performed, tissue cultures submitted, and she was empirically begun on ciprofloxacin and itraconazole. The histopathology findings showed epidermal necrosis and minimal inflammation (Fig 2) and fungal hyphae on Gomori methenamine silver staining (Fig 3). The tissue culture grew Yarrowia lipolytica. Her antibiotic regimen was subsequently changed to fluconazole. A computed tomography examination of the finger found osteomyelitis, and at the suggestion of the plastic surgery department, the patient underwent a distal interphalangeal joint amputation of the affected finger. The surgical pathology report from this procedure noted the presence of fungal organisms. Her postoperative course was unremarkable, and she was discharged on a 14-day course of oral fluconazole. To date, her infection has not recurred.

### Sporotrichosis [^112Js3R5]. Clinics in Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on sporotrichosis:

- Definition: Sporotrichosis is a subacute or chronic infection caused by the dimorphic fungus Sporothrix schenckii. It primarily affects the skin, subcutaneous tissues, and lymphatic system but can disseminate to other organs, particularly in immunocompromised individuals.
- Pathophysiology: Sporothrix schenckii enters the body through minor skin trauma, such as a thorn prick, or through bites and scratches of animals. In the environment, it exists as a mold and converts to a yeast form at body temperature, inducing a granulomatous inflammatory response. This response leads to the formation of nodules and ulcers. The infection can also spread along lymphatic vessels, causing lymphocutaneous sporotrichosis.
- Epidemiology: Sporotrichosis is a rare disease, predominantly occurring in tropical and subtropical regions. The estimated rate of sporotrichosis-associated hospitalizations in the US is 0.35 per 1,000,000 person-years. The incidence of sporotrichosis in South America is estimated at 48–60 per 100,000 person-years.
- Risk factors: Risk factors for sporotrichosis include occupational and recreational activities involving soil, wood, and plants, such as gardening, farming, and hunting, exposure to infected animals (particularly in veterinarians), recent travel to endemic regions, and immunocompromising conditions, such as HIV/AIDS, diabetes, alcohol use disorder, and immunosuppressive therapy.
- Disease course: The incubation period ranges from 1 to 12 weeks. The cutaneous form typically starts as a papule and evolves into nodular lesions that may ulcerate. In lymphocutaneous sporotrichosis, patients present with nodules along lymphatic drainage tracts. Pulmonary sporotrichosis manifests with symptoms such as cough, hemoptysis, fever, and weight loss, resembling pulmonary tuberculosis. Disseminated sporotrichosis often involves the bones, joints, and CNS.
- Prognosis and risk of recurrence: Different genotypes of Sporothrix schenckii may be associated with varying clinical forms and levels of virulence. Sporotrichosis generally responds well to antifungal therapy, with a relatively poor prognosis observed in disseminated and meningeal forms in immunocompromised patients.

### Is the thought-action repertoire a viable intervention target in substance use populations? [^113D9BsB]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study examined if general population findings of positive correlations between happiness and breadth of thought-action repertoire (TAR) hold in substance use populations, and tests if the TAR is a modifiable intervention target.

Methods

Using data from a randomized online survey on 468 adults in recovery from problematic substance use, we compared 5 happiness exercises to two control exercises on participants' post-exercise TAR, as measured by Frederickson's Modified Open-Ended Twenty Statements Test (MOETST) and coded specifically for action tendencies.

Results

A negative binomial regression model indicated that momentary happiness reported before exercise completion was significantly and positively related to the breadth of action tendency repertoires (exp(b) = 1.05, exp(95% CI) [1.01, 1.09], p = 0.012). Two of five happiness exercises were associated with higher action tendency scores compared to the "Three Hard Things" control condition ("Savoring": exp(b) [95% CI]: 1.51 [1.10, 2.09], X 2 (df = 1) = 6.36, adj. p = 0.038; "Rose, Thorn, Bud": 1.50 [1.09, 2.06], X 2 (df = 1) = 6.19, adj. p = 0.038). None were significantly different from a neutral control. Effects were not significant for MOETST raw scores.

Conclusions

Results indicate that momentary happiness is associated with broadened action tendencies among individuals in recovery. Brief, self-administered happiness exercises can successfully broaden this aspect of the thought-action repertoire in this population.

### Sporotrichosis cluster in domestic cats and veterinary technician, Kansas, USA, 2022 [^111qytGJ]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

This report was limited by a lack of detailed exposure information for how the cats acquired sporotrichosis. Nevertheless, keeping cats indoors is recommended to prevent environmental acquisition of sporotrichosis. Risk factors for feline acquisition of sporotrichosis likely resemble those for humans, including traumatic inoculation or wound contamination with hay, roses, or sphagnum moss, or bites or scratches from other cats. Intact male, free-roaming cats might be at increased risk for sporotrichosis. Cats with sporotrichosis should be kept indoors and apart from other cats in the home to reduce the potential for further transmission. In conclusion, increased awareness of sporotrichosis in cats and the potential for zoonotic transmission could help veterinary professionals more quickly recognize and treat feline cases and take precautions to prevent human acquisition in the veterinary setting.

### 'A disastrous blow': psychiatric risk, social indicators and medical authority in abortion reform in post-war britain [^115UnJoQ]. Medical Humanities (2020). Medium credibility.

The rise and origins of risk have been richly theorised, perhaps most notably by Ulrich Beck. Beck argued that as risks are dependent on choices, they are ' politically reflexive '; that the sources of danger were not 'ignorance but knowledge '. 14 As this article demonstrates, the knowability of patients' contexts was a critical issue in debates over abortion reform. As Robert Castel has pointed out, 'new strategies dissolve the notion of a subject or a concrete individual, and put in its place a combination of factors, the factors of risk'. 15 Put another way, a 'risk does not arise from the presence of a particular danger embodied in a concrete individual or group. It is the effect of a combination of abstract factors which render more or less probable the occurrence of undesirable modes of behaviour'. 16 Risk attained a particular importance in post-war Britain: Nikolas Rose has argued that while public health has been attentive to risk as a metric since the 19th century, 'risk thinking' assumes a particular significance and character in societies dominated by pharmaceutical modes of treatment. 17 The global rise of pharmacological interventions in the post-war period has indeed been charted by historians. 18 The late-20th century, Rose has concurred with Castel, oversaw a shift from the move from dangerousness to risk in psychiatric thinking. 19 'The responsibilities of almost all psychiatric professionals have come to be redefined in terms of the assessment of risk' Rose observes, and through the 'generalisation of the criterion of risk' mental health professionals 'participate in the management of individuals'. 20 In the case of abortion reform, of course, doctors oversaw the management of individual patients, and the criterion of risk was made official in legislation. Anthony Giddens observed that much contemporary politics is 'now about managing risks — risks which do not originate in the political sphere, yet have to be politically managed'. 21 Abortion reform legislation, passed through parliament, formalised medical management of the risk posed by unwanted pregnancies. Through the examination of the ways that risk was implicated in abortion reform, we can come to understand how psychiatric risk made the social visible in post-war Britain.

### Balancing benefits and potential risks of vaccination: the precautionary principle and the law of unintended consequences [^116dvEji]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Vaccination is a life-saving endeavour, yet risk and uncertainty are unavoidable in science and medicine. Vaccination remains contentious in the public mind, and vaccine hesitancy is a serious public health issue. This has recently been reignited in the discussion over potential side effects of COVID-19 vaccines, and the decision by several countries to suspend measures such as the AstraZeneca vaccine. In these instances, the precautionary principle has often been invoked as a rationale, yet such heuristics do not adequately weigh potential harms against real benefits. How we analyse, communicate and react to potential harms is absolutely paramount to ensure the best decisions and outcomes for societal health, and maintaining public confidence. While balancing benefits and risks is an essential undertaking, it cannot be achieved without due consideration of several other pertinent factors, especially in the context of vaccination, where misguided or exaggerated fears have in the past imperilled public health. While well meaning, over reactions to potential hazards of vaccination and other health interventions can have unintended consequences, and cause lingering damage to public trust. In this analysis, we explore the challenges of assessing risk and benefit, and the limitations of the precautionary principle in these endeavours. When risk is unclear, cautious vigilance might be a more pragmatic and useful policy than reactionary suspensions.

### Management of a large plant-derived foreign body under the plica semilunaris: a case report [^1166wv1K]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

Small ocular surface foreign bodies are commonly encountered in ophthalmology practice. They may adhere to the cornea or conjunctiva, or become lodged in the fornices, causing discomfort, lacrimation, and pain, and can be expelled by blinking or tearing. Unexpected large foreign bodies trapped in the conjunctival fornix or subconjunctiva must be examined carefully and extracted surgically. In the present case, the foreign body at the plica semilunaris had completely penetrated into the subconjunctival space. Once embedded, the patient's acute symptoms subsided, likely contributing to the initial misdiagnosis as simple conjunctivitis. However, ongoing mechanical stimulation from the foreign body induced localized inflammation, increasing the risk of granuloma formation.

It is interesting to speculate how a large plant-derived seed with thorns on its surface could penetrate into the conjunctiva. In a case of lacrimal stone initiated by an cilium trapped in the lacrimal sac, an electron microscopy image of a cilium led the authors to speculate that the imbricated surface of the cilium caused preferential movement in the direction of the root of the cilium, while preventing its movement in the opposite direction. In the present case, the elliptical shape and unidirectional orientation of thorns on the surface of the foreign body, similar to the surface of a cilium, might have facilitated its conjunctival penetration.

The clinical manifestations of ocular foreign bodies vary according to their location. Superficial conjunctival foreign bodies typically cause ocular pain, lacrimation, and photophobia. In contrast, large, deeply embedded foreign bodies may cause severe inflammation, posing substantial risks to both visual function and ocular integrity. Patients with suspected ocular foreign bodies should avoid eye rubbing to prevent further damage and should seek immediate medical attention.

When ophthalmologists evaluate patients presenting with chief complaints of ocular irritation, detailed inquiry and thorough ocular examinations should be performed, particularly considering the possibility of occult foreign bodies in the conjunctival sac or subconjunctival. Concurrently, this case reinforces the importance of examining the plica semilunaris and conjunctival fornices in cases where symptoms persist despite treatment.

### Transmission potential of smallpox in contemporary populations [^117FUq6w]. Nature (2001). Excellent credibility.

Despite eradication, smallpox still presents a risk to public health whilst laboratory stocks of virus remain. One factor crucial to any assessment of this risk is R0, the average number of secondary cases infected by each primary case. However, recently applied estimates have varied too widely (R0 from 1.5 to > 20) to be of practical use, and often appear to disregard contingent factors such as socio-economic conditions and herd immunity. Here we use epidemic modelling to show a more consistent derivation of R0. In isolated pre-twentieth century populations with negligible herd immunity, the numbers of cases initially rose exponentially, with an R0 between 3.5 and 6. Before outbreak controls were applied, smallpox also demonstrated similar levels of transmission in 30 sporadic outbreaks in twentieth century Europe, taking into account pre-existing vaccination levels (about 50%) and the role of hospitals in doubling early transmission. Should smallpox recur, such estimates of transmission potential (R0 from 3.5 to 6) predict a reasonably rapid epidemic rise before the implementation of public health interventions, because little residual herd immunity exists now that vaccination has ceased.

### Tender violaceous nodule on the palm [^111CP4cS]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Question 2: What is the most common mode of transmission?
A. Inhalation of spores
B. Inoculation injury with exposure to soil
C. Cat scratch
D. Exposure to contaminated fish tanks
E. Handling of infected animal tissues

Answers:

A. Inhalation of spores – Incorrect. Aspergillosis and infection with dimorphic fungi (blastomycosis, histoplasmosis, and coccidioidomycosis) can be caused by spore inhalation. An infection with these organisms would not be expected to present as a solitary cutaneous nodule with no other findings; systemic symptoms, including pneumonia, would be expected.
B. Inoculation injury with exposure to soil – Correct. Phaeohyphomycosis usually follows an inoculation injury, and the causative fungi are frequently found in soil. The patient did not recall any trauma in this case, but the biopsy revealed a wood splinter within the nodule (Fig 2); the most common sources of cutaneous inoculation of sporotrichosis include exposure to plants such as rose bushes.
C. Cat scratch – Incorrect. Cat scratch disease is caused by Bartonella henselae, can sometimes present as a solitary subcutaneous nodule, and is classically observed in the context of infection stemming from a cat scratch. Fungi would not be expected in the lesion.
D. Exposure to contaminated fish tanks – Incorrect. Mycobacterium marinum often presents as a cutaneous infection and can be found in fresh water and salt water. Exposure frequently arises from swimming or cleaning aquariums (fish tank granuloma), and fungi would not be expected in the lesion.
E. Handling of infected animal tissues – Incorrect. Tularemia, caused by Francisella tularensis, can be acquired by handling infected animal tissues (most commonly rabbit tissues). It has variable presentations and can present as a tender, pink papule at the site of inoculation that may enlarge and evolve into an ulcer.

### The contribution of mycetoma grains to suboptimal disease management [^1128LrBX]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Inoculation route and disease onset

Infection initiates when traumatic injury breaches the skin barrier, introducing pathogenic elements into subcutaneous tissue. Common mechanisms include punctures by thorns, sharp splinters or minor lacerations during daily activities. Such injuries often appear minor, healing rapidly without immediate symptoms, thereby allowing patients to overlook the initial exposure, and hence, the disease incubation period is unknown. The inoculated microorganisms evade early immune detection, exploiting the trauma-induced tissue damage to establish infection. Over time, they proliferate, forming characteristic granulomatous lesions and grains, which incite chronic inflammation, fibrosis, and progressive tissue destruction.

### Penetrating keratoplasty for invasive fungal keratitis resulting from a thorn injury involving phomopsis species [^112NzMm5]. Cornea (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this study was to report a case of Phomopsis fungal keratitis that was diagnosed 2 months after a rose thorn injury that occurred while gardening.

Methods

The authors conducted a retrospective case report with literature review.

Results

Deep stromal keratitis with extension of hyphae through Descemet's membrane was treated by therapeutic keratoplasty combined with oral and topical antifungal medications. The causative organism, a Phomopsis species, was identified by culture of the surgical specimens. Phomopsis, a plant fungus, has not been previously reported as a cause of human fungal keratitis. One year after the initial surgery, visual rehabilitation was accomplished with a repeat cornea transplant and cataract extraction with return of vision to 20/25.

Conclusions

Advanced fungal keratitis can be successfully treated by a combination of surgery to debulk the infectious organisms and pre- and postoperative medical therapy. Prompt recognition of fungal keratitis will increase the likelihood of cure. Phomopsis species, ubiquitous plant fungi, can cause infectious keratitis in humans.

### Macrophages: a double-edged sword in female reproduction and disorders [^113WqHLe]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Tissue-resident macrophages

Elie Metchnikoff, a Russian zoologist, first identified macrophages in 1882 when he observed interesting cells that encircled and devoured a rose thorn introduced into a transparent starfish larva. To determine the irreplaceable roles of these cells in host defense and the phagocytosis of unwanted cells during development, injury and repair, Elie Metchnikoff received the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in the year 1908. Macrophages are now known as the main regulators of inflammation and subsequent repair. Resident macrophages in healthy adult tissues are either derived from circulating monocytes or established before birth and are maintained independently of monocytes during adult life. These cells together form the 'mononuclear phagocyte system', and each type of macrophage is designated by a unique name based on its location within the body (Fig. 1). In contrast, most macrophages that accumulate in diseased or damaged tissues are derived from circulating monocytes. Monocytes are attracted to unhealthy areas by chemotaxis, which is triggered by a range of stimuli, including damaged cells, pathogens and cytokines released by macrophages already on site. Unlike short-lived neutrophils, macrophages survive in the body for several months.

### Ten-year follow-up of fracture risk in a systematic population-based screening program: the risk-stratified osteoporosis strategy evaluation (ROSE) randomised trial [^116UFSXY]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Around 80% responded to the ROSE questionnaire, but less than 70% provided sufficient data for FRAX calculation, leading to baseline characteristic imbalances between the screening and control groups. Additionally, 29% of women offered a DXA scan declined or did not attend their scheduled appointment. These women tended to be older, more frequently lived alone, and exhibited a higher risk profile for osteoporotic fractures compared to women who underwent DXA scans. Disparities in participation within population-based screening programs concerns the program's effectiveness. Sensitivity analyses supported that the screening's effect weakened when those who chose not to participate in the DXA scan were not excluded, possibly reflecting the natural effect of the screening program. On the other hand, the analyses indicated the screenings programs effectiveness if enough individuals accept DXA scanning. It raises questions about how we can design stratified and differentiated programs that target the group with the highest risk but lowest health literacy. Both practical and health issues must be taken into consideration. Furthermore, self-administered questionnaires may present barriers to participation among specific high-risk individuals. Therefore, it is worthwhile to consider alternative screening approaches that are built upon automated digital detection tools, such as the Fracture Risk Evaluation Model, FREM, or the Fracture Liaison Service, FLS, which hold the potential to enhance the screening uptake.

### Extending the boundaries of the declaration of helsinki: a case study of an unethical experiment in a non-medical setting [^112NWC2F]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2001). Low credibility.

To examine the ethical issues involved in governmental decisions with potential health risks, we review the history of the decision to raise the interurban speed limit in Israel in light of its impact on road death and injury. In 1993, the Israeli Ministry of Transportation initiated an "experiment" to raise the interurban speed limit from 90 to 100 kph. The "experiment" did not include a protocol and did not specify cut-off points for early termination in the case of adverse results. After the raise in the speed limit, the death toll on interurban roads rose as a result of a sudden increase in speeds and case fatality rates. The committee's decision is a case study in unfettered human experimentation and public health risks when the setting is non-medical and lacks a defined ethical framework. The case study states the case for extending Helsinki type safeguards to experimentation in non-medical settings.

### Testing syndemic models along pathways to psychotic spectrum disorder: implications for population-level preventive interventions [^112ewzzk]. Psychological Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Implications

Our findings confirmed a broad category of PSD due to social determinants and involving differing pathways from CA for testing in future longitudinal research. We propose a hypothetical mechanism in which CA leads to developmental brain abnormalities but also increases the risk of multiple adverse risk factors during childhood and adolescence, including high-risk behaviors, such as SM, which can in turn trigger PSD. We found direct effects of CA on PSD but stronger effects along a second pathway where CA contributed directly to a cascade of risk factors including VC, SH, and SM, which were specific to PSD (Zhang & Coid). Our findings suggest that prevention of CA should be a primary public mental health preventive strategy but that a single component strategy in adolescence/early adulthood targeting SM is also likely to be effective.

Further research is required to identify contextual factors that determine whether interventions should be targeted on specific population groups, such as those experiencing syndemics which are particularly at risk, or can potentially involve the entire population (Frohlich & Potvin; Rose; Aagaard-Hansen, Hindhede, & Terkildsen Maindal). However, if syndemics are localized and do not extend to entire populations (Singer, Bulled, & Leatherman,), new methods need to be developed to identify which populations require public health interventions, together with the contextual factors leading to the multimorbidity in which syndemics occur. Other syndemic factors need to be explored, including economic instability and access to mental health services, and testing these models in diverse populations, including among women and in non-urban populations. More information is needed on why some populations experiencing adverse contextual factors experience syndemics while others experiencing the same factors do not, and the implications for prevention.

### Estimates of global and regional potential health gains from reducing multiple major risk factors [^116jRKW4]. Lancet (2003). Excellent credibility.

Background

Estimates of the disease burden due to multiple risk factors can show the potential gain from combined preventive measures. But few such investigations have been attempted, and none on a global scale. Our aim was to estimate the potential health benefits from removal of multiple major risk factors.

Methods

We assessed the burden of disease and injury attributable to the joint effects of 20 selected leading risk factors in 14 epidemiological subregions of the world. We estimated population attributable fractions, defined as the proportional reduction in disease or mortality that would occur if exposure to a risk factor were reduced to an alternative level, from data for risk factor prevalence and hazard size. For every disease, we estimated joint population attributable fractions, for multiple risk factors, by age and sex, from the direct contributions of individual risk factors. To obtain the direct hazards, we reviewed publications and re-analysed cohort data to account for that part of hazard that is mediated through other risks.

Results

Globally, an estimated 47% of premature deaths and 39% of total disease burden in 2000 resulted from the joint effects of the risk factors considered. These risks caused a substantial proportion of important diseases, including diarrhoea (92%-94%), lower respiratory infections (55–62%), lung cancer (72%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (60%), ischaemic heart disease (83–89%), and stroke (70–76%). Removal of these risks would have increased global healthy life expectancy by 9.3 years (17%) ranging from 4.4 years (6%) in the developed countries of the western Pacific to 16.1 years (43%) in parts of sub-Saharan Africa.

Interpretation

Removal of major risk factors would not only increase healthy life expectancy in every region, but also reduce some of the differences between regions. The potential for disease prevention and health gain from tackling major known risks simultaneously would be substantial.

### Fish predators control outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish [^113inRmf]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Outbreaks of corallivorous Crown-of-Thorns Starfish (CoTS, Acanthaster spp.) have caused persistent and widespread loss of coral cover across Indo-Pacific coral reefs. The potential drivers of these outbreaks have been debated for more than 50 years, hindering effective management to limit their destructive impacts. Here, we show that fish biomass removal through commercial and recreational fisheries may be a major driver of CoTS population outbreaks. CoTS densities increase systematically with increasing fish biomass removal, including for known CoTS predators. Moreover, the biomass of fish species and families that influence CoTS densities are 1.4 to 2.1-fold higher on reefs within no-take marine reserves, while CoTS densities are 2.8-fold higher on reefs that are open to fishing, indicating the applicability of fisheries-based management to prevent CoTS outbreaks. Designing targeted fisheries management with consideration of CoTS population dynamics may offer a tangible and promising contribution to effectively reduce the detrimental impacts of CoTS outbreaks across the Indo-Pacific.

### ACOEM OEM core competencies: 2021 [^112RAmZE]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Environmental health — OEM physicians should have the knowledge and skills necessary to recognize potential chemical, physical, and biological environmental causes of health concern to the individual as well as to community health, and environmental issues most often include air, water, or soil contamination by natural or artificial pollutants. OEM physicians should be competent in taking an exposure history that includes environmental as well as occupational exposures, must understand how to identify environmental hazards, can characterize risk based on an assessment of exposure that includes potential routes of exposures and risk assessment, understand dose–response relationships and how to compare environmental and biomonitoring data to published standards, and should be aware of common clinically significant environmental agents and diseases such as lead, asbestos, arsenic, and radon. Core knowledge and skills include to identify sources and routes of environmental exposure and recommend methods of reducing environmental health risks.

### Animals in healthcare facilities: recommendations to minimize potential risks [^117Ttmed]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2015). Medium credibility.

Animals in healthcare facilities — when pet visitation may be considered and associated risks — Situations where visitation with a pet might be considered include visitation of a terminally ill patient, visitation of a patient hospitalized for a prolonged period, and visitation of a patient with a close bond to the animal where the healthcare team suspects potential improvement in physical or mental health. Visitation by a pet is different than animal-associated activities, and risks may be increased because there is no formal training of the owner/designee as with an animal-assisted activities handler(s), pets have not been temperament tested, and pets do not typically undergo the same degree of health assessment or exclusion practices (eg, age) as animals used in animal-assisted activities.

### Chronic synovitis caused by a date palm thorn: an unusual clinical picture [^116duV1E]. Arthroscopy (2002). Low credibility.

Synovitis related to plant thorns is a rare pathology. As in this case, thorn prick injury, which is particularly caused by thin palm thorns, is frequently missed in clinical history. Clinical presentation of cases may simulate juvenile rheumatoid arthritis with monoarticular involvement and septic arthritis. Removal of all thorns with partial or total synovectomy is essential in definitive treatment. Arthroscopy is the most valuable method of meeting both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes as it provides the best visibility of the joint with lower morbidity.

### Macrophages: friend or foe in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis? [^113hSWo1]. Respiratory Research (2018). Low credibility.

Origin of macrophages

Macrophages are small populations of leukocytes that play an important role in the cross-talk between innate and adaptive immunity. As early as 1893, Metchnikoff first described the term "phagocytes" when he used a rose thorn to challenge a starfish. He classified the phagocytes into macrophages (macro = big, phage = eater) and microphages (now better known as neutrophils), which promoted the development of a theory of phagocytosis. In the 1960s, several studies proposed that macrophages were solely derived from the terminal differentiation of circulating monocytes. However, this theory has been refuted by the recent discoveries that most adult tissue-resident macrophages are seeded before birth, stem from the embryonal yolk sac and fetal liver, possess a self-renewing capacity and are maintained independent of circulating monocytes. In addition, the function of macrophages varies significantly based on their anatomical location, functional phenotype, morphology, as well as their gene expression profile, such as the alveolar macrophages, adipose tissue macrophages, Kupffer cells in the liver, and microglia cells in the central nervous system.

### Why women chose unassisted home birth in Malaysia: a qualitative study [^113BGnBt]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

An easy process

The women perceived birthing as an effortless process with minimal or rather lack the risk of harm to mother and the unborn child. They were convinced of their ability for normal birth. Information from the resources on unassisted home birth further strengthen their confidence. They perceived birthing as a physiological process, and one woman explained the process of birthing philosophically as the blooming of a flower.

### Desogestrel and ethinyl estradiol (reclipsen) [^114FzJ1J]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Sunday Start

When taking Reclipsen, the first rose-colored "active" tablet should be taken on the first Sunday after menstruation begins. If the period begins on Sunday, the first rose-colored "active" tablet is taken on that day. If switching directly from another oral contraceptive, the first rose-colored "active" tablet should be taken on the first Sunday after the last ACTIVE tablet of the previous product. Tablets are taken without interruption as follows: One rose-colored "active" tablet daily for 21 days, then one white "reminder" tablet daily for 7 days. After 28 tablets have been taken, a new course is started and a rose-colored "active" tablet is taken the next day (Sunday). When initiating a Sunday start regimen, another method of contraception should be used until after the first 7 consecutive days of administration.

The use of Reclipsen for contraception may be initiated 4 weeks postpartum. When the tablets are administered during the postpartum period, the increased risk of thromboembolic disease associated with the postpartum period must be considered. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS concerning thromboembolic disease. See also PRECAUTIONS: Nursing Mothers.) If the patient starts on Reclipsen postpartum, and has not yet had a period, she should be instructed to use another method of contraception until a rose-colored "active" tablet has been taken daily for 7 days. The possibility of ovulation and conception prior to initiation of medication should be considered. If the patient misses one (1) rose-colored "active" tablet in Weeks 1, 2, or 3, the rose-colored "active" tablet should be taken as soon as she remembers. If the patient misses two (2) rose-colored "active" tablets in Week 1 or Week 2, the patient should take two (2) rose-colored "active" tablets the day she remembers and two (2) rose-colored "active" tablets the next day; and then continue taking one (1) rose-colored "active" tablet a day until she finishes the pack. The patient should be instructed to use a back-up method of birth control such as a condom or spermicide if she has sex in the seven (7) days after missing pills. If the patient misses two (2) rose-colored "active" tablets in the third week or misses three (3) or more rose-colored "active" tablets in a row, the patient should continue taking one rose-colored "active" tablet every day until Sunday. On Sunday the patient should throw out the rest of the pack and start a new pack that same day. The patient should be instructed to use a back-up method of birth control if she has sex in the seven (7) days after missing pills.

### Disseminated-cutaneous sporotrichosis in an immunocompetent adult [^1138mA7h]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Classically known for causing 'rose gardeners' disease', Sporothrix schenkii is a dimorphic fungus ubiquitous in plant matter. Sporotrichosis infection typically follows minor cutaneous trauma, causing localized lymphocutaneous (up to 95% of cases) or fixed-cutaneous (up to 30%) forms. A rare disseminated-cutaneous form occurs in up to 8%, primarily in immunodeficient patients.

### Leukemia cutis mimicking a sporotrichoid distribution as initial presentation of acute promyelocytic leukemia [^113rcyM7]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Case

A 32-year-old male with no past medical history presented to the emergency department with concerns of weakness, bleeding of his gums, and bruising of his extremities. Associated symptoms also included headache, cough, and dyspnea. Laboratory work-up was significant for hemoglobin of 5.5 g/dL and platelet count of 7000/mm 3. Complete blood count with differential demonstrated 3% blasts with an angel wing appearance and promyelocytes, findings concerning for acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL).

Dermatology was consulted for multiple necrotic nodules and eschars in a linear distribution across his right dorsal hand and forearm that had been present for 2 weeks (Fig 1). The patient recently immigrated to the United States from Mexico and had been working on a farm picking blueberries. The cutaneous eruption began as scratches from bush thorns, which subsequently developed into the pictured skin pathology. Although initially painful, lesions were no longer tender at the time of exam. The patient denied any pruritus, bleeding, or other drainage.

Fig 1
Initial presentation of eschars mimicking a sporotrichoid spread on the patient's right upper extremity.

Due to the history of onset after trauma from a plant thorn as well as the sporotrichoid-like distribution of lesions, our differential diagnoses included infectious agents such as sporotrichosis, cat scratch disease, anthrax, leishmaniasis, nocardiosis, tularemia, or atypical mycobacteria. Punch biopsies demonstrated CD117 and myeloperoxidase-positive, large, atypical mononuclear cells (Figs 2 and 3). Grocott's Methenamine silver was negative for fungal organisms, and fungal culture was also negative. This histologic picture was consistent with cutaneous involvement of the patient's newly diagnosed leukemia (ie, LC).

### Lenticular fungal infection caused by aspergillus in a patient with traumatic corneal laceration: a case report [^111EboDq]. BMC Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Post-traumatic primary intralenticular fungal infections are rare. In many cases of lenticular infection, the lens is secondarily affected by the infection spreading from an anterior or posterior-chamber fungal mass. However, in this case, the penetrating injury involved the lens directly. When patients present with trauma in the anterior segment of the eyeball from sharp-edged fine thorns, direct fungal inoculation of the lens should be suspected. Furthermore, fungal infections after an open-globe injury are rare but should be primarily considered, especially in cases of trauma from foreign matter such as thorns, branches, stones, and mud particles. Therefore, a prescription of topical corticosteroids to control the inflammatory reaction should be considered carefully, and thorough inspection is essential before steroid administration.

Multiple simultaneous injuries from tiny organic foreign matter increase the risk of fungal infection, and in cases of inflammatory reaction, a delayed fungal infection should be suspected. As this case shows, delayed fungal intralenticular infection in immunocompetent patients with localization in the anterior segment may have a good visual prognosis.

### Adverse events associated with colonoscopy; an examination of online concerns [^111Jwtky]. BMC Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

We found that internet search queries for respiratory symptoms rose approximately one week after queries relating to colonoscopy, raising the possibility that such symptoms are an under-reported late adverse effect of the procedure. Given the widespread use of colonoscopy as a screening modality and the rise of anesthesia-assisted colonoscopy in the United States in recent years, this signal is of potential public health concern. Future studies should focus on measuring the incidence of and risk factors for cough and other respiratory symptoms following colonoscopy, recording the type of sedation used, employing a prospectively administered questionnaire, and including a non-colonoscopy control group. Such as study, designed to identify symptoms that do not necessarily reach the threshold for hospitalization, would clarify the potential safety signal identified in this analysis.

### Global burden and strength of evidence for 88 risk factors in 204 countries and 811 subnational locations, 1990–2021: a systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2021 [^111z3q7w]. Lancet (2024). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic revealed profound health disparities between individuals and across geographies. These differential impacts reflect a combination of multiple contributing risk factors affecting individuals and the varying capacities of health-care systems to protect and treat their populations. To strengthen the ability of health systems to meet future challenges, there is a need to focus on primary prevention. In this context, and to regain momentum towards meeting UN Sustainable Development Goals, identifying and quantifying the impact of key risk factors can help prioritise the use of scarce resources.

Targeting the reduction of modifiable risk factors is a powerful and essential strategy to prevent ill health and premature deaths due to diseases and injuries. Effective risk-reduction policies and practices are dependent on location-specific and population-specific information about relationships between risk factors and health outcomes, trends in the prevalence of leading risk factors, and the proportion of disease-specific mortality and morbidity that can be attributed to particular risk factors. Rigorous, well-sourced risk factor meta-analyses can highlight areas of public health progress, provide insight into persisting or emerging risks and consequent health challenges, and inform further modelling of plausible risk-factor reduction scenarios — including cost-effectiveness — to galvanise effective risk-reduction policies and practices. To produce these vital risk factor data, the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) has, since 1996, systematically estimated exposure to risk factors, relative health risk by exposure, and attributable disease burden for comprehensive sets of risk factors. For a specified set of causes of death and disability, attributable burden metrics are calculated to quantify the proportion of burden — measured in disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), representing the sum of years of life lost to premature mortality and years lived with disability — that can be attributed to a particular risk factor or combination of risk factors. To improve estimation accuracy in response to an ever-changing global health landscape, successive iterations of GBD risk factor analyses have incorporated key methodological advancements and added emerging risk factors and health outcomes. Other research efforts and networks of health scientists have contributed valuable global, multi-country, and population-level data on specific risk factors or groupings of risk factors; such endeavours include the NCD Risk Factor Collaboration, and the Prospective Urban and Rural Epidemiological study (PURE). However, only GBD produces systematic analyses of a comprehensive set of risk factors, identified on the basis of standardised data-driven criteria, in 204 countries and territories worldwide.

Implications of all the available evidence

Improved analysis of risk exposure and burden attributable to risk factors at the national, regional, and global level can help to focus attention on risks for which exposure is increasing and in which locations.

### Management of a large plant-derived foreign body under the plica semilunaris: a case report [^112bMhPa]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Foreign bodies are a common cause of eye pain and tears; however, the majority of cases involve small foreign bodies. Herein, we report a rare case of a large plant-derived foreign body covered with thorns penetrating the conjunctiva into the subconjunctival plica semilunaris following vigorous eye rubbing.

Case presentation

A 50-year-old woman from rural Leshan presented with persistent redness and swelling on the nasal side of her left eye lasting 10 days. The plica semilunaris appeared elevated, congested, and edematous. A sharp plant-derived tip, approximately 1-mm in length, was visible on the nasal aspect of the elevated area. The temporal bulbar conjunctiva appeared pale and semicircular. The foreign body was extracted from the conjunctiva under a slit lamp by grasping the exposed tip. The extracted foreign body, measuring 8 mm in length and 4 mm in diameter, resembled a plant-derived seed with thorns covering its surface. The patient's conjunctival inflammation and discomfort resolved completely following removal and topical treatment.

Conclusion

When evaluating patients presenting with ocular irritation as the chief complaint, thorough ocular examinations should be performed, particularly considering the possibility of occult foreign bodies. Concurrently, the present case underlines the significance of considering occult subconjunctival foreign bodies in cases of persistent conjunctival inflammation.

### Obesity: why be concerned? [^113ZmCk6]. The American Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

The obesity epidemic in the United States represents a critical public health issue that has the potential to incur major healthcare costs because of the substantial risks associated with excess body fat. Whereas many recognize the significant risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus associated with excess body fat, a myriad of other health problems can accompany overweight and obesity, potentially leading to early morbidity and mortality. Public recognition of obesity as an important health crisis, and not simply a matter of cosmetics or lifestyle choice, is clearly needed. A greater awareness of the health risks associated with excess weight will facilitate more frequent obesity screenings and discussions about healthy weight management that have the potential to result in a greater commitment of healthcare resources to effective obesity prevention and management strategies.

### The 2023 report of the Lancet countdown on health and climate change: the imperative for a health-centred response in a world facing irreversible harms [^113uqGPY]. Lancet (2023). Excellent credibility.

Executive Summary

The Lancet Countdown is an international research collaboration that independently monitors the evolving impacts of climate change on health, and the emerging health opportunities of climate action. In its eighth iteration, this 2023 report draws on the expertise of 114 scientists and health practitioners from 52 research institutions and UN agencies worldwide to provide its most comprehensive assessment yet.

In 2022, the Lancet Countdown warned that people's health is at the mercy of fossil fuels and stressed the transformative opportunity of jointly tackling the concurrent climate change, energy, cost-of-living, and health crises for human health and wellbeing. This year's report finds few signs of such progress. At the current 10-year mean heating of 1·14°C above pre-industrial levels, climate change is increasingly impacting the health and survival of people worldwide, and projections show these risks could worsen steeply with further inaction. However, with health matters gaining prominence in climate change negotiations, this report highlights new opportunities to deliver health-promoting climate change action and a safe and thriving future for all.

The rising health toll of a changing climate

In 2023, the world saw the highest global temperatures in over 100 000 years, and heat records were broken in all continents through 2022. Adults older than 65 years and infants younger than 1 year, for whom extreme heat can be particularly life-threatening, are now exposed to twice as many heatwave days as they would have experienced in 1986–2005 (indicator 1.1.2). Harnessing the rapidly advancing science of detection and attribution, new analysis shows that over 60% of the days that reached health-threatening high temperatures in 2020 were made more than twice as likely to occur due to anthropogenic climate change (indicator 1.1.5); and heat-related deaths of people older than 65 years increased by 85% compared with 1990–2000, substantially higher than the 38% increase that would have been expected had temperatures not changed (indicator 1.1.5).

Simultaneously, climate change is damaging the natural and human systems on which people rely for good health. The global land area affected by extreme drought increased from 18% in 1951–60 to 47% in 2013–22 (indicator 1.2.2), jeopardising water security, sanitation, and food production. A higher frequency of heatwaves and droughts in 2021 was associated with 127 million more people experiencing moderate or severe food insecurity compared with 1981–2010 (indicator 1.4), putting millions of people at risk of malnutrition and potentially irreversible health effects. The changing climatic conditions are also putting more populations at risk of life-threatening infectious diseases, such as dengue, malaria, vibriosis, and West Nile virus (indicator 1.3).

Compounding these direct health impacts, the economic losses associated with global heating increasingly harm livelihoods, limit resilience, and restrict the funds available to tackle climate change. Economic losses from extreme weather events increased by 23% between 2010–14 and 2018–22, amounting to US$264 billion in 2022 alone (indicator 4.1.1), whereas heat exposure led to global potential income losses worth $863 billion (indicators 1.1.4 and 4.1.3). Labour capacity loss resulting from heat exposure affected low and medium Human Development Index (HDI) countries the most, exacerbating global inequities, with potential income losses equivalent to 6·1% and 3·8% of their gross domestic product (GDP), respectively (indicator 4.1.3).

The multiple and simultaneously rising risks of climate change are amplifying global health inequities and threatening the very foundations of human health. Health systems are increasingly strained, and 27% of surveyed cities declared concerns over their health systems being overwhelmed by the impacts of climate change (indicator 2.1.3). Often due to scarce financial resources and low technical and human capacity, the countries most vulnerable to climate impacts also face the most challenges in achieving adaptation progress, reflecting the human risks of an unjust transition. Only 44% of low HDI countries and 54% of medium HDI countries reported high implementation of health emergency management capacities in 2022, compared with 85% of very high HDI countries (indicator 2.2.5). Additionally, low and medium HDI countries had the highest proportion of cities not intending to undertake a climate change risk assessment in 2021 (12%; indicator 2.1.3). These inequalities are aggravated by the persistent failure of the wealthiest countries to deliver the promised modest annual sum of $100 billion to support climate action in those countries defined as developing within the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. Consequently, those countries that have historically contributed the least to climate change are bearing the brunt of its health impacts — both a reflection and a direct consequence of the structural inequities that lie within the root causes of climate change.

The human costs of persistent inaction

The growing threats experienced to date are early signs and symptoms of what a rapidly changing climate could mean for the health of the world's populations. With 1337 tonnes of CO 2 emitted each second, each moment of delay worsens the risks to people's health and survival.

In this year's report, new projections reveal the dangers of further delays in action, with every tracked health dimension worsening as the climate changes. If global mean temperature continues to rise to just under 2°C, annual heat-related deaths are projected to increase by 370% by midcentury, assuming no substantial progress on adaptation (indicator 1.1.5). Under such a scenario, heat-related labour loss is projected to increase by 50% (indicator 1.1.4), and heatwaves alone could lead to 524·9 million additional people experiencing moderate-to-severe food insecurity by 2041–60, aggravating the global risk of malnutrition. Life-threatening infectious diseases are also projected to spread further, with the length of coastline suitable for Vibrio pathogens expanding by 17–25%, and the transmission potential for dengue increasing by 36–37% by midcentury. As risks rise, so will the costs and challenges of adaptation. These estimates provide some indication of what the future could hold. However, poor accounting for non-linear responses, tipping points, and cascading and synergistic interactions could render these projections conservative, disproportionately increasing the threat to the health of populations worldwide.

A world accelerating in the wrong direction

The health risks of a 2°C hotter world underscore the health imperative of accelerating climate change action. With limits to adaptation drawing closer, ambitious mitigation is paramount to keep the magnitude of health hazards within the limits of the capacity of health systems to adapt. Yet years of scientific warnings of the threat to people's lives have been met with grossly insufficient action, and policies to date have put the world on track to almost 3°C of heating.

The 2022 Lancet Countdown report highlighted the opportunity to accelerate the transition away from health-harming fossil fuels in response to the global energy crisis. However, data this year show a world that is often moving in the wrong direction. Energy-related CO 2 emissions increased by 0·9% to a record 36·8 Gt in 2022 (indicator 3.1.1), and still only 9·5% of global electricity comes from modern renewables (mainly solar and wind energy), despite their costs falling below that of fossil fuels. Concerningly, driven partly by record profits, oil and gas companies are further reducing their compliance with the Paris Agreement: the strategies of the world's 20 largest oil and gas companies as of early 2023 will result in emissions surpassing levels consistent with the Paris Agreement goals by 173% in 2040 — an increase of 61% from 2022 (indicator 4.2.6). Rather than pursuing accelerated development of renewable energy, fossil fuel companies allocated only 4% of their capital investment to renewables in 2022.

Meanwhile, global fossil fuel investment increased by 10% in 2022, reaching over $1 trillion (indicator 4.2.1). The expansion of oil and gas extractive activities has been supported through both private and public financial flows. Across 2017–21, the 40 banks that lend most to the fossil fuel sector collectively invested $489 billion annually in fossil fuels (annual average), with 52% increasing their lending from 2010–16. Simultaneously, in 2020, 78% of the countries assessed, responsible for 93% of all global CO 2 emissions, still provided net direct fossil fuels subsidies totalling $305 billion, further hindering fossil fuel phase-out (indicator 4.2.4). Without a rapid response to course correct, the persistent use and expansion of fossil fuels will ensure an increasingly inequitable future that threatens the lives of billions of people alive today.

The opportunity to deliver a healthy future for all

Despite the challenges, data also expose the transformative health benefits that could come from the transition to a zero-carbon future, with health professionals playing a crucial role in ensuring these gains are maximised. Globally, 775 million people still live without electricity, and close to 1 billion people are still served by health-care facilities without reliable energy. With structural global inequities in the development of, access to, and use of clean energy, only 2·3% of electricity in low HDI countries comes from modern renewables (against 11% in very high HDI countries), and 92% of households in low HDI countries still rely on biomass fuels to meet their energy needs (against 7·5% in very high HDI countries; indicators 3.1.1 and 3.1.2). In this context, the transition to renewables can enable access to decentralised clean energy and, coupled with interventions to increase energy efficiency, can reduce energy poverty and power high quality health-supportive services. By reducing the burning of dirty fuels (including fossil fuels and biomass), such interventions could help avoid a large proportion of the 1·9 million deaths that occur annually from dirty-fuel-derived, outdoor, airborne, fine particulate matter pollution (PM 2·5; indicator 3.2.1), and a large proportion of the 78 deaths per 100 000 people associated with exposure to indoor air pollution (indicator 3.2.2). Additionally, the just development of renewable energy markets can generate net employment opportunities with safer, more locally available jobs. Ensuring countries, particularly those facing high levels of energy poverty, are supported in the safe development, deployment, and adoption of renewable energy is key to maximising health gains and preventing unjust extractive industrial practices that can harm the health and livelihoods of local populations and widen health inequities.

With fossil fuels accounting for 95% of road transport energy (indicator 3.1.3), interventions to enable and promote safe active travel and zero-emission public transport can further deliver emissions reduction, promote health through physical activity, and avert many of the 460 000 deaths caused annually by transport-derived PM 2·5 pollution (indicator 3.2.1), and some of the 3·2 million annual deaths related to physical inactivity. People-centred, climate-resilient urban redesign to improve building energy efficiency, increase green and blue spaces, and promote sustainable cooling, can additionally prevent heat-related health harms, avoid air-conditioning-derived emissions (indicator 2.2.2), and provide direct physical and mental health benefits.

Additionally, food systems are responsible for 30% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, with 57% of agricultural emissions in 2020 being derived from the production of red meat and milk (indicator 3.3.1). Promoting and enabling equitable access to affordable, healthy, low-carbon diets that meet local nutritional and cultural requirements can contribute to mitigation, while preventing many of the 12·2 million deaths attributable to suboptimal diets (indicator 3.3.2).

The health community could play a central role in securing these benefits, by delivering public health interventions to reduce air pollution, enabling and supporting active travel and healthier diets, and promoting improvements in the environmental conditions and commercial activities that define health outcomes. Importantly, the health sector can lead by example and transition to sustainable, resource-efficient, net-zero emission health systems, thereby preventing its 4·6% contribution to global GHG emissions, with cascading impacts ultimately affecting the broader economy (indicator 3.4).

Some encouraging signs of progress offer a glimpse of the enormous human benefits that health-centred action could render. Deaths attributable to fossil-fuel-derived air pollution have decreased by 15·7% since 2005, with 80% of this reduction being the result of reduced coal-derived pollution. Meanwhile the renewable energy sector expanded to a historical high of 12·7 million employees in 2021 (indicator 4.2.2); and renewable energy accounted for 90% of the growth in electricity capacity in 2022 (indicator 3.1.1). Supporting this, global clean energy investment increased by 15% in 2022, to $1·6 trillion, exceeding fossil fuel investment by 61% (indicator 4.2.1); and lending to the green energy sector rose to $498 billion in 2021, approaching fossil fuel lending (indicator 4.2.7).

Scientific understanding of the links between health and climate change is rapidly growing, and although coverage lags in some of the most affected regions, over 3000 scientific articles covered this topic in 2022 (indicators 5.3.1 and 5.3.2). Meanwhile, the health dimensions of climate change are increasingly acknowledged in the public discourse, with 24% of all climate change newspaper articles in 2022 referring to health, just short of the 26% in 2020 (indicator 5.1). Importantly, international organisations are increasingly engaging with the health co-benefits of climate change mitigation (indicator 5.4.2), and governments increasingly acknowledge this link, with 95% of updated Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement now referring to health — up from 73% in 2020 (indicator 5.4.1). These trends signal what could be the start of a life-saving transition.

A people-centred transformation: putting health at the heart of climate action

With the world currently heading towards 3°C of heating, any further delays in climate change action will increasingly threaten the health and survival of billions of people alive today. If meaningful, the prioritisation of health in upcoming international climate change negotiations could offer an unprecedented opportunity to deliver health-promoting climate action and pave the way to a thriving future. However, delivering such an ambition will require confronting the economic interests of the fossil fuel and other health-harming industries, and delivering science-grounded, steadfast, meaningful, and sustained progress to shift away from fossil fuels, accelerate mitigation, and deliver adaptation for health. Unless such progress materialises, the growing emphasis on health within climate change negotiations risks being mere healthwashing; increasing the acceptability of initiatives that minimally advance action, and which ultimately undermine — rather than protect — the future of people alive today and generations to come.

Safeguarding people's health in climate policies will require the leadership, integrity, and commitment of the health community. With its science-driven approach, this community is uniquely positioned to ensure that decision makers are held accountable, and foster human-centred climate action that safeguards human health above all else. The ambitions of the Paris Agreement are still achievable, and a prosperous and healthy future still lies within reach. But the concerted efforts and commitments of health professionals, policy makers, corporations, and financial institutions will be needed to ensure the promise of health-centred climate action becomes a reality that delivers a thriving future for all.

### Rapid increase in the risk of heat-related mortality [^1168fwri]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Extreme heat is associated with substantial impacts on human health –. In the past, extreme heatwaves in under-prepared communities have been responsible for several thousands of deaths within just a few weeks –. With anthropogenic climate change already accounting for roughly a third of heat-related deaths, the risk of deadly heat is projected to further increase as the climate continues to warm rapidly –. While several studies have projected future heat-related mortality, they were based on a selected set of deterministic scenarios, and estimated future heat mortality levels as the mean of a given climate period or scenario –. These approaches do not capture the full suite of possible climate futures and may under-represent the potential risk for heat-related mortality, which can be driven by rare but extreme years. At the same time, probabilistic projections of extreme heat often lack the additional step of quantifying the corresponding human impacts, including the health impacts. To allow for a more comprehensive risk assessment of highly impactful events for human health, we apply a probabilistic approach to the quantification of future heat-related mortality risk. Such probabilistic risk assessments are widespread in the risk assessment of natural hazards, such as floodingor tropical cyclones, as knowledge of the magnitude and probability of potential impacts are key to prepare for and adapt to climatic extremes. Our analysis is performed for 748 locations from 47 countries for which the Multi-Country Multi-City (MCC) Collaborative Research Network collected observed daily mortality and temperature data during recent decades (Table 2). Using this data, we quantify empirical exposure-response functionswhich we combine with output from five single-model initial-condition large ensembles (SMILEs)by using the natural catastrophe risk platform CLIMADA. The SMILE climate model output is generated by running a single climate model multiple times with perturbed initial conditions but following the same radiative forcing scenario. This creates diverging weather and climate patterns for each model run, resulting in an ensemble spread that displays the internal climatic variability. The variability within the ensemble allows us to explore physically plausible extreme years and is thus well suited to estimate tail-risks.

### Wilderness Medical Society practice guidelines for the prevention and treatment of lightning injuries: 2014 update [^112jBzKR]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Lightning injuries — regional considerations highlight weather, geography, and situational risks: Lightning strikes are not uniformly distributed around the Earth, and thunderstorms are formed by 3 atmospheric elements: moisture, warm air on the surface of the earth, and a lifting wind. Geography influences incidence, with Central Africa having the greatest incidence of lightning strikes because of its mountainous terrain coupled with moist airflow from the Atlantic Ocean, leading to year-round thunderstorms; worldwide, rural populations have been at greatest risk, attributed to higher occupational exposure and limited access to substantial buildings for shelter. Though rare, lightning is possible even if the overlying sky is blue (so-called bolt from the blue) and can occur in sunny conditions after a storm, posing a risk to people who return to outdoor activity too soon; lightning is also possible in snowstorms, and graupel heralds weather favorable to lightning formation by generating the electrical gradient that facilitates lightning formation.

### Desogestrel and ethinyl estradiol (reclipsen) [^1165nx7k]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Day 1 Start

The dosage of Reclipsen for the initial cycle of therapy is one rose-colored "active" tablet administered daily from the 1st day through the 21st day of the menstrual cycle, counting the first day of menstrual flow as "Day 1". Tablets are taken without interruption as follows: One rose-colored "active" tablet daily for 21 days, then one white "reminder" tablet daily for 7 days. After 28 tablets have been taken, a new course is started and a rose-colored "active" tablet is taken the next day.

The use of Reclipsen for contraception may be initiated 4 weeks postpartum in women who elect not to breastfeed. When the tablets are administered during the postpartum period, the increased risk of thromboembolic disease associated with the postpartum period must be considered. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS concerning thromboembolic disease. See also PRECAUTIONS: Nursing Mothers.) If the patient starts on Reclipsen postpartum, and has not yet had a period, she should be instructed to use another method of contraception until a rose-colored "active" tablet has been taken daily for 7 days. The possibility of ovulation and conception prior to initiation of medication should be considered. If the patient misses one (1) rose-colored "active" tablet in Weeks 1, 2, or 3, the rose-colored "active" tablet should be taken as soon as she remembers. If the patient misses two (2) rose-colored "active" tablets in Week 1 or Week 2, the patient should take two (2) rose-colored "active" tablets the day she remembers and two (2) rose-colored "active" tablets the next day; and then continue taking one (1) rose-colored "active" tablet a day until she finishes the pack. The patient should be instructed to use a back-up method of birth control such as a condom or spermicide if she has sex in the seven (7) days after missing pills. If the patient misses two (2) rose-colored "active" tablets in the third week or misses three (3) or more rose-colored "active" tablets in a row, the patient should throw out the rest of the pack and start a new pack that same day. The patient should be instructed to use a back-up method of birth control if she has sex in the seven (7) days after missing pills.

### Neonatal sporotrichosis [^113xRgzE]. Pediatric Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Sporotrichosis is caused by the dimorphic fungus, Sporothrix schenckii. Classically, infection occurs after implantation of the organism into the skin by abrasion of a puncture wound by contaminated thorns, hay, or sphagnum moss. Cats are also a commonly recognized source of sporotrichosis. In children, fixed cutaneous lesions are more common than lymphocutaneous lesions, and the face is a frequent location for infection. We present a neonate with a fixed cutaneous facial lesion and both pre-auricular and cervical lymphadenopathy who developed signs of infection at 3 weeks of age. This patient is currently the youngest reported case of sporotrichosis in the literature. The patient's family denied any trauma and denied contact with flowers, gardens, and cats; thus, the source of infection remains unknown.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections among HIV-exposed and HIV-infected children: recommendations from CDC, the National Institutes of Health, the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society, and the American Academy of Pediatrics [^116SDS7i]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Histoplasmosis exposure prevention — Most infections occur without a recognized exposure history, so complete avoidance of exposure in histoplasmosis-endemic regions is not possible; high-risk exposures involve disturbances that aerosolize spores, including soil contaminated with bird or bat droppings, older urban and rural structures, decaying vegetation or trees, caves, and activities such as excavation, demolition, renovation, gardening, and agricultural work during dry and windy conditions. Education should be directed toward avoidance of these activities, and if not feasible, reducing the release of spores by wetting potentially contaminated areas and use of protective respiratory devices should be recommended.

### Is increased sleep responsible for reductions in myocardial infarction during the COVID-19 pandemic? [^116FGBKQ]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the highly contagious SARS-CoV-2 virus has had devastating consequences across the globe. However, multiple clinics and hospitals have experienced a decrease in rates of acute myocardial infarction and corresponding cardiac catheterization lab activations, raising the question: Has the risk of myocardial infarction decreased during COVID? Sleep deprivation is known to be an independent risk factor for myocardial infarction, and sleep has been importantly impacted during the pandemic, possibly due to the changes in work-home life leading to a lack of structure. We conducted a social media-based survey to assess potential mechanisms underlying the observed improvement in risk of myocardial infarction. We used validated questionnaires to assess sleep patterns, tobacco consumption and other important health outcomes to test the hypothesis that increases in sleep duration may be occurring which have a beneficial impact on health. We found that the COVID-19 pandemic led to shifts in day/night rhythm, with subjects waking up 105 minutes later during the pandemic (p < 0.0001). Subjects also reported going to sleep 41 minutes later during the pandemic (p < 0.0001). These shifts led to longer duration of sleep during the COVID-19 pandemic. Before the pandemic, subjects reported sleeping 6.8 hours per night, which rose to 7.5 hours during the pandemic, a 44 minute or 11% increase (p < 0.0001). We acknowledge the major negative health impact of the global pandemic but would advocate for using this crisis to improve the work and sleep habits of the general population, which may lead to overall health benefits for our society.

### Global burden of 87 risk factors in 204 countries and territories, 1990–2019: a systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2019 [^113FJi7Z]. Lancet (2020). Excellent credibility.

Analysing relative risks to inform choices by individuals and choices by population health decision makers might legitimately have different perspectives. Some guidelines on systematic reviews, recommend reporting absolute risk levels related to exposure; this method is perhaps appropriate for informing individual choice. For public policy, attributable burden might be more relevant. If a risk factor is related to 1000 deaths, from a public policy perspective, the concentration of the risk in a smaller or larger group of individuals might matter less than it does to individuals. To provide a synthesis of the evidence for different users, we included estimation of the all-cause mortality relative risk associated with exposure levels of each risk factor using the global distribution of burden across outcomes. However, risks that cause relatively modest increases for individuals but are highly prevalent, such as air pollution, are, nevertheless, legitimate targets for public policy.

### Individual heterogeneity, educational attainment and cardiovascular mortality: a pooled analysis of Norwegian health surveys [^115KG9XV]. BMJ Public Health (2024). High credibility.

At the general level, several explanations for the differences in CVD risk between individuals may be relevant. First is the gene–environment interaction for the established risk factors with stronger causal effects in subgroups. Second is that cognitive ability and other latent unmeasured personal factors related to education may put individuals repeatedly at risk through unhealthy behaviour, environment and lifestyle. Measurement of risk factors only at baseline may here be insufficient in capturing risk. Some of these personal factors could have genetic origin and be related to the environment and lifestyle from infancy through the life course by gene–environment correlation. Third, early life factors may play a role, including both non-genetic factor and potential interactions with genetics. Shared environmental factors in early life may be transmitted from the family environment or intrauterine exposures. Other potential risk factors for CVD have been suggested, such as ankle-brachial index, high-sensitive C reactive protein level and coronary artery calcium score. Their contribution, in addition to established risk factors, to risk prediction is considered modest. Finally, these differences could be a result of random events adding up risk over the life course. Many of these are often difficult to measure and observe, but they need to follow a non-random pattern in order to play a role in social inequalities. Unfortunately, we were not able to study cognitive ability here as the sample size was inadequate. Studies of cognitive ability and later health have proposed several explanations for the association. High cognitive ability may include better health literacy and uptake of healthy behaviour. However, it could also give people a general tendency related to health, which is difficult to measure with risk factors. Here we stratified by education and found larger variation in the high educated groups. This can arise as a consequence of the relative importance of risk factors compared with other unobserved factors. Lower educated groups have higher levels of risk factors such as smoking. Hence, in the low educated group, these probably dominate the risk, whereas in the high educated other factors may become proportionally more important. This is consistent with the point made by Geoffrey Rose that if everyone in a population smokes, then social differences in lung cancer are proportionately more explained by other factors such as asbestos exposure. Interventions to reduce tobacco smoking, such as increased taxes on alcohol and tobacco, would still have a significantly stronger impact on reducing absolute inequalities. Our results should be further investigated in available samples with relevant risk factors. We also acknowledge that model misspecification could be attributed to the frailty in the type of analyses performed here. Underlying heterogeneity may differ between women and men. Future research should investigate this.

### Fish predators control outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish [^117GiAZq]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

a Coral reef fish families monitored by the Australian Institute of Marine Science's Long-Term Monitoring Programme (see Supplementary Table 5 for species monitored within the Labridae, Lethrinidae, Lutjanidae and Serranidae families and considered in this study).

b Parrotfish were previously considered a separate family (Scaridae) but are now placed as a sub-family Scarinae within the Labridae.

c Fish species within these families observed consuming injured, moribund and/or dead CoTS only.

In this study, we examine whether recent population outbreaks of the Pacific Crown-of-Thorn Starfish (Acanthaster cf. solaris) in the GBR Marine Park are influenced by removal of coral reef fish through commercial and recreational fisheries, which have been the major extractive activities on the GBR since at least the 1950s (Supplementary Method 1). Our study combines CoTS and coral reef fish monitoring data and fisheries retained catch data independently collected across the 344,400 km 2 GBR Marine Park since 1985 to (1) determine whether CoTS densities can be predicted by the removal of coral reef fish biomass; (2) quantify the effects of no-take marine reserves (Supplementary Table 1) on the biomass, density and size of fish groups that influence CoTS densities; and (3) evaluate whether fisheries management is applicable to CoTS control by comparing CoTS densities between reefs within no-take marine reserves to those that are open to fishing. We demonstrate that (1) CoTS densities increase systematically with increasing fish biomass removal, including for known CoTS predators; (2) the biomass of fish species and families that influence CoTS densities are 1.4–2.1-fold higher on reefs within no-take marine reserves, and (3) CoTS densities are 2.8-fold higher on reefs that are open to fishing. Our results strongly suggest that fish biomass removal through commercial and recreational fisheries may be a major driver of CoTS population outbreaks, indicating the applicability of targeted fisheries-based management to prevent CoTS outbreaks.

### Global burden of 87 risk factors in 204 countries and territories, 1990–2019: a systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2019 [^116YxWsW]. Lancet (2020). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

The mechanism for much of disease and injury prevention is through modifying environmental, occupational, behavioural, and metabolic risk factors. Other pathways, such as vaccination or addressing social determinants of health, are crucially important, but a substantial component of public health has targeted modifying the aforementioned risk factors. Whether the risk factor is targeted through public policy such as taxation or regulation, through programmes such as water supply improvement, or primary care advice and pharmacological intervention, it is essential to track progress on risk exposure. Which risk factors are declining, stagnating, or even increasing gives insights into where current efforts are working or are insufficient. Understanding where the promise of prevention is being realised might generate lessons that can be applied to other risks in which progress is slow. Tracking the burden attributable to risk exposure, measured by deaths, years of life lost (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), or disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), can also help governments, donor agencies, international organisations, and civil society organisations to identify new priorities.

To help track risk exposures and the burden attributable to these exposures, many studies are published each year on the burden of specific risks, often in specific countries or regions. To our knowledge, the only effort to examine attributable burden with standardised methods across a wide set of risk factors spanning all countries is the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD). Many choices go into the comparable quantification of the burden of risk factors; GBD provides a rules-based approach to evidence synthesis that follows the Guidelines on Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting. Comparable quantification across risks over time and across populations facilitates identifying relative importance and how population health risks are evolving over time. GBD also provides a framework to understand both the trends in risk exposure and the trends in burden attributable to risks. Quantifying and reporting both exposure and attributable burden is important because exposure might be increasing and attributable burden decreasing if other drivers of the underlying outcomes are declining at a fast enough rate.

### The burden of proof studies: assessing the evidence of risk [^116PdJiB]. Nature Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

Using a meta-analytic approach built using open-source tools, we estimated both the mean risk function and the BPRF for 180 risk–outcome pairs and assigned them a star rating based on the strength of the evidence (indicated by ROS that aggregate BPRF across standard exposure ranges) and severity of the risk. We achieved this by capturing the shape of the relationship between exposure and the risk of an outcome, detecting outliers using robust statistical methodology (trimming), testing and correcting for bias related to study design, and estimating between-study heterogeneity, adjusted for the number of studies. The BPRF is the level of elevated risk for a harmful factor (or the level of reduced risk for a protective factor) based on the most conservative (closest to null) interpretation compatible with the available evidence. It is a reflection of both the magnitude of the risk and the extent of the uncertainty surrounding the mean risk function. The four examples in the results section demonstrate the range of evidence, between-study heterogeneity and mean relative risks across risk–outcome pairs, and how these factors impact the BPRF and star rating. Importantly, only 22 of 180 pairs received a four- or five-star rating (12.22%), whereas 112 received a one- or two-star rating (62.22%).

3.4.4 Positive thoughts and acceptance of life׳s adversities

Three studies reported that people with depression coped by accepting the difficulty of their circumstances or reframed circumstances positively. In a study of 75 women with depression in India, 97.3% accepted that nothing could be changed and over 90% believed that their circumstances would improve with time. This was also seen in the IDIs; persons with depression sought comfort in that others had similar problems or were worse off, that one had to be thankful for what one had, and that there were more important aspects to life. A 45-year old man with depression elaborated: " Roses have thorns but we never wish for roses without thorns. This (illness) is like that. " Another 54-year old man with depression stated: " If there is financial stress, I don׳t worry. Being scared won׳t help. I think of many people whose financial positions are worse than ours and there are many people whose financial positions are better than ours. One must be content with what one has. "

3.4.5 Solving problems

Five studies reported that people with depression often tried to solve problems as a form of self-coping. In a study of 75 women with depression, 94.7% tried to analyse their problem and solve them incrementally. This finding was confirmed in the IDIs. A 54-year old man with depression stated: " If the expenses of children increase, we should reduce our (other) expenses to keep expenses within limit. "

### Painful linear ulcers: a case of cutaneous sporotrichosis mimicking pyoderma gangrenosum [^1118a7F4]. JAAD Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

Sporotrichosis is a chronic granulomatous infection caused by the saprophytic dimorphic fungus S schenckii, present as a mold in environmental sources such as soil, plant debris, hay, and sphagnum moss. It is uncommon in the United States, but sporotrichosis is endemic in tropical and subtropical regions and can be found worldwide. Sporotrichosis has been referred to as rose gardener's disease because of its prevalence on rose bushes. There have also been cases of zoonotic transmission, including cases transmitted through scratches and bites from infected cats, particularly in Brazil. Traumatic inoculation or contamination of a preexisting wound by the mold form, which converts in the host to a yeast form, leads to cutaneous infection. Occupational and recreational exposure can occur through activities such as gardening, forestry, or caring for infected animals. In our patient's case, there was no history of activities such as gardening nor any certain trauma.

### Electronic cigarettes for smoking cessation [^115Vyais]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Adverse events

Three trials in which nicotine EC were compared to non‐nicotine EC (both with NRT as an adjunct) reported data on AEs. Baldassarri 2018 (refillable; high risk of bias) reported results combined across groups but noted "no significant differences by treatment group" (Supplementary material 11). Pooled data from the other two studies (one refillable and one pod; one at high risk of bias; one reporting tobacco/vaping industry funding: Rose 2023*) also showed no clear evidence of difference (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.32; I² = 0%; 677 participants). Sensitivity analyses, removing the study at high risk of bias (Walker 2020) and removing the industry‐funded study (Rose 2023*), did not affect the interpretation of this result (Table 5).

The four trials comparing nicotine EC + NRT to NRT alone contributing data to this outcome were all at high risk of bias; none reported tobacco/vaping industry funding. Pooling results from all three studies resulted in high statistical heterogeneity, precluding meta‐analysis (I 2 = 78%). Individual findings are presented in Analysis 20.2.

Serious adverse events

Pooled data from two studies (one refillable and one pod; one high risk, one unclear; one reporting tobacco/vaping industry funding), comparing nicotine EC with non‐nicotine EC as adjuncts to NRT, showed fewer SAEs in the nicotine EC group than in the non‐nicotine EC group, but the CI included no difference (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.14; I² = 0%; 1069 participants). Removing the study with industry funding (Rose 2023*) had no effect on interpretation.

Five studies (three refillable, one cartridge and one pod; all high risk of bias; none reporting tobacco/vaping industry funding) provided data on SAEs and compared nicotine EC + NRT to NRT alone. The pooled estimate favoured the NRT‐alone group, but only two studies reported events and the CI was wide and included no difference (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.45 to 3.41; I² = 0%; 2352 participants).

Health risk information from active Pepsi Bottling Group employees who completed health risk assessments between 2004 and 2006 (N = 11,217) were linked to medical care, workers' compensation, and short-term disability cost data. Ten health risks were examined. Multivariate analyses were performed to estimate costs associated with having high risk, holding demographics, and other risks constant. Potential savings from risk reduction were estimated.

Results

High risk for weight, blood pressure, glucose, and cholesterol had the greatest impact on total costs. A one-percentage point annual reduction in the health risks assessed would yield annual per capita savings of $83.02 to $103.39.

Conclusions

Targeted programs that address modifiable health risks are expected to produce substantial cost reductions in multiple benefit categories.

### Sporotrichosis in the highlands of Madagascar, 2013–2017 [^116TMb16]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Sporotrichosis is a chronic fungal infection of humans and animals, found mostly in tropical and subtropical regions. The causal fungi develop in the soil or on plants and infect mammals through wounds, either directly (wounds from spiky plants or thorns) or through contact with contaminated soil or infected animals. Thus, sporotrichosis is a so-called implantation mycosis, affecting principally rural populations, particularly those who work with bare hands and feet. The disease is caused by a dimorphic fungus of the genus Sporothrix. These fungi display a high degree of genomic diversity, leading to the description of at least 6 cryptic species: S. schenckii, S. brasiliensis, S. globosa, S. luriei, S. mexicana, and S. albicans (formerly S. pallida). S. mexicana and S. albicans are mostly environmental (saprophytic and nonpathogenic). The infection generally occurs as a lymphocutaneous form with an ulcerated subcutaneous nodule at the inoculation site and similar secondary lesions arising along the lymphatic route. Mucosal or primary pulmonary forms are less common. Some cases occur as disseminated forms with multiorgan involvement, most notably in HIV-infected persons.

### Acute and postacute sequelae associated with SARS-CoV-2 reinfection [^115YwMpZ]. Nature Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

In sum, in this study of 5,819,264 individuals, we provide evidence that reinfection contributes to additional health risks beyond those incurred in the first infection including all-cause mortality, hospitalization and sequelae in a broad array of organ systems. The risks were evident in the acute and postacute phases of reinfection. The evidence suggests that for people who already had a first infection, prevention of a second infection may protect from additional health risks. Prevention of infection and reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 should continue to be the goal of public health policy.

### Eumycetoma: a diagnostic challenge of a neglected tropical disease [^115tPK8C]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Eumycetoma, a subcutaneous infection caused by various fungi with pathognomonic discharging grain, is rarely reported in Malaysia. This case concerns a eumycetoma infection in an immunocompetent man who presented with progressive left foot swelling complicated with pustules, sinuses and pale grain discharge for the past year after recurrent thorn pricks. Histological findings of the grain and tissue showed foci of septate fungal hyphae. Tissue culture yielded no growth. Amplification and sequencing of the rDNA internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1), ITS4 and large subunit regions of the tissue identified the causative agent as Fusarium falciforme, highlighting the role of molecular diagnostic method in identifying fungal species in eumycetoma. The patient was treated with surgical excision and oral itraconazole with excellent improvement. However, he presented again with recurrence after defaulting therapy. F. falciforme has been implicated in causing diseases in crops and sea turtles. Therefore, the One Health approach should be adopted to manage this emerging species.

### ACMT and AACT position statement: preventing occupational fentanyl and fentanyl analog exposure to emergency responders [^111HZKEp]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2017). Medium credibility.

Background — potency and epidemiology: Fentanyl and fentanyl analogs are potent opioid receptor agonists and are increasingly implicated in overdose and death in North America among illicit opioid users, with the reported mortality from synthetic opioids rose 72.2% (to 9,580) from 2014 to 2015. Fentanyl is 50–100 times more potent than morphine at the μ-opioid receptor, and carfentanil, an opioid developed for veterinary use, is 10,000 times more potent than morphine in animals; despite its improved therapeutic index compared to morphine, very small errors in carfentanil dosing with illicitly distributed drugs will result in lethal doses. Authorities in the United States have reported seizures of fentanyl, fentanyl precursors (e.g. N-phenyl-1-(2-phenylethyl) piperidin-4-amine), and analogs such as acetylfentanyl, butyrylfentanyl, and furanylfentanyl; other analogs such as alfentanil, remifentanil, and sufentanil are used in clinical practice, and there are limited pharmacological data on other analogs found in the illicit drug supply.

### Corneal perforation and delayed anterior chamber collapse from a devil's club thorn [^1124muW4]. Cornea (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

To report the corneal perforation and delayed collapse of the anterior chamber caused by the thorn from a devil's club plant.

Methods

An 8-year-old Alaska Native girl was struck in the eye with the stalk and leaves of a devil's club plant. Although 3 thorns from the plant were found to be lodged superficially in the corneal stroma, 1 was deeply embedded to the level of Descemet's membrane. The thorn was surrounded by a stromal infiltrate. Four days after the injury, the patient suffered a sudden collapse of the anterior chamber after the deeply embedded thorn became dislodged.

Results

The corneal wound was sutured, and the patient had an uneventful postoperative course.

Conclusions

Our experience suggests that devil's club corneal injuries should be examined daily after the initial injury. The anterior chamber may suddenly collapse after a deeply embedded thorn becomes dislodged.

### Epidemiological, clinical, and histopathological characteristics of patients with sporotrichoid lymphocutaneous infection in Southern Thailand: a 10-year retrospective study [^115tfyan]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2023). Medium credibility.

Previous studies on cutaneous and subcutaneous infectious granuloma have not focused on the distribution pattern of the lesions, and most studies showed a higher prevalence of mycobacterial infection than of fungal infection. However, in this study, we observed sporotrichoid distribution of the lesions and a higher prevalence of fungal infection. Thus, in cases of sporotrichoid lymphocutaneous syndrome caused by fungus, antifungal medications should be used for treatment; however, the drug of choice should be determined after the causative pathogen has been confirmed with extensive investigations.

The demographic data of our patients were similar to those reported in other studies: the mean age was nearly 50 years, and female sex was predominant. The morphologies of the skin lesions varied among the studies. In our study, nodules were the most frequently observed lesions in both fungal and NTM infections, whereas plaques were common in the fungal group but uncommon in the NTM group. In addition, ulcerative lesions were only observed in the fungal group. This finding was similar to that reported in a previous study, but we found no statistically significant association between skin lesion morphology and causative pathogen. However, previous studies have reported a high frequency of plaques in cases of NTM infections. Therefore, skin biopsy for tissue culture and histopathological examination must be performed for all skin lesions that are highly suspicious.

Skin trauma was found to be a risk factor for exploring infections. In the present study, over half of the patients had experienced different types of skin injuries. Mammal-caused injures, such as cat/dog scratch/bite or other exposures to pets, were the most common traumas, followed by thorn prick, aquatic injuries, and insect bites. The geographic location of the study population may have affected the incidence rates of different injuries. Fungal infections seemed to be associated with mammal-caused injuries, but there was no statistically significant association. Although fungal pathogens are mainly found in soil, plants, and organic material, the disease was usually transmitted to humans by infected animals (e.g. cat or dog). However, in previous studies, nearly half of the study population could not recall the source of their external cutaneous injuries.

### Management of a large plant-derived foreign body under the plica semilunaris: a case report [^112v9UMS]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Foreign bodies are a common cause of eye pain and tears, with most being relatively small in size, generally including small pieces of sand, iron, silk thread, eyelashes, insect, or plant materials. Foreign bodies may attach to the cornea or become sequestered in the conjunctiva of the upper or lower eyelids. Although the majority of foreign bodies are small and superficial, large subconjunctival foreign bodies, particularly those penetrating under the plica semilunaris, are extremely rare. Only a few cases of large foreign bodies trapped in the conjunctival fornix have been reported previously, including a coleoptera cincindelidae beetle (8 mm), a plastic toy (8 × 6 × 6 mm), and a bean seed (1 cm). In this report, we present a rare case of a large plant-derived foreign body covered with thorns that penetrated the conjunctiva into the subconjunctival plica semilunaris following vigorous eye rubbing.

### Introduction to risk assessment and serum risk markers for the prevention of coronary heart disease and other potential conditions that impact men's health, part II: what do I tell my patients? [^11426p76]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Markers and other potential tests for cardiovascular risk abound, and a more extensive review of these and other markers can be found elsewhere. Cardiovascular health tends to mirror urologic health for several conditions. It is imperative in the urology setting that clinicians discuss the probability of early morbidity and mortality with patients. This should not undermine the importance of prostate cancer and other diseases, but rather place risks in their proper perspective. Patients seem to need this guidance more than ever because life expectancy for most individuals continues to increase, and the potential for comorbidities seems to increase in the average aging patient. It is hoped that this article will prompt new interest in evaluating some risk factors for various urologic conditions. This may move researchers closer to discovering intervention agents that could impact numerous male health conditions favorably. Improving men's health will require a concerted educational and research effort from several health disciplines, a reminder that different medical specialties have much in common, and the role of preventive medicine is to point out similarities as opposed to differences.

### E-cigarettes and urologic health: a collaborative review of toxicology, epidemiology, and potential risks [^1118w4ed]. European Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Context

Use of electronic cigarettes (ECs) is on the rise in most high-income countries. Smoking conventional cigarettes is a known risk factor for urologic malignancy incidence, progression, and mortality, as well as for other urologic health indicators. The potential impact of EC use on urologic health is therefore of clinical interest to the urology community.

Objective

To review the available data on current EC use, including potential benefits in urologic patients, potential issues linked to toxicology of EC constituents, and how this might translate into urologic health risks.

Evidence Acquisition

A Medline search was carried out in August 2016 for studies reporting urologic health outcomes and EC use. Snowballing techniques were also used to identify relevant studies from recent systematic reviews. A narrative synthesis of data around EC health outcomes, toxicology, and potential use in smoking cessation and health policy was carried out.

Evidence Synthesis

We found no studies to date that have been specifically designed to prospectively assess urologic health risks, even in an observational setting. Generating such data would be an important contribution to the debate on the role of ECs in public health and clinical practice. There is evidence from a recent Cochrane review of RCTs that ECs can support smoking cessation. There are emerging data indicating that potentially harmful components of ECs such as tobacco-specific nitrosamines, polyaromatic hydrocarbons, and heavy metals could be linked to possible urologic health risks.

Conclusions

ECs might be a useful tool to encourage cessation of conventional cigarette smoking. However, data collection around the specific impact of ECs on urologic health is needed to clarify the possible patient benefits, outcomes, and adverse events.

Patient Summary

While electronic cigarettes might help some people to stop smoking, their overall impact on urologic health is not clear.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^114ZxZA1]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Histoplasmosis prevention — exposure reduction recommendations state that most infections occur without a recognized exposure history and complete avoidance in endemic regions is not possible; high-risk exposures include disturbances of contaminated areas with aerosolization of spores such as soil with bird or bat droppings, older urban and rural structures, decaying vegetation or trees, caves, and activities like excavation, demolition, renovation, gardening, and agricultural work, and education should direct avoidance of these activities; if not feasible, wetting contaminated areas to reduce spore release and use of protective respiratory devices should be recommended.

### Sporotrichosis basics… [^113gn24u]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Sporotrichosis is a severe skin infection caused by the fungus Sporothrixthat lives in soil and plants.
- It is considered a neglected tropical disease and causes devastating health and economic problems in some tropical and subtropical areas.
- In the U. S., most infections are caused by contact with plant matter.
- In South America, a type of the fungus, Sporothrix brasiliensis, is spreading from cats to people. Overview Sporotrichosis is a fungal skin infection caused by Sporothrix, a fungus that lives in soil and on plants. It affects both people and animals. People get infected when Sporothrix gets in cuts or scrapes. For example, infections can be caused by pricks from rose thorns or scratches from an infected cat. Cat-associated sporotrichosis is a growing global public health concern. Types and strains Sporothrix schenck ii Sporothrix schenck ii is the most common species of Sporothrix in the U. S. Most infections with S. schenckii are caused by contact with plants. Rarely, this strain can spread from animals to humans. Types of infection and symptoms include Cutaneous
- Starts as a small painless red, purple, or pink bump on the skin. Over time, more bumps may start to appear and grow larger. Eventually they may start to pus, become open sores, and spread up the arm or from the infection site. Risk factors Contact with plant matter increases risk for infection. This includes activities and occupations that involve gardening, forestry work, and baling hay. In areas where cat-transmitted sporotrichosis is spreading, veterinarians and people who provide care for or own cats are most at risk. Sporotrichosis is not the same thing as cat-scratch disease, which is a bacterial illness spread by cats.

Causes and spread Sporotrichosis spread is a One Health issue involving humans, animals, and the environment. Plants and environment The fungus that causes sporotrichosis, Sporothrix, lives in the environment on soil and plants like sphagnum moss, rose bushes, and hay. People can get infected if they have contact with soil or plants where the fungus is found.
