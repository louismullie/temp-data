## Question

What are common causes of Helicobacter pylori infection?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the common causes of Helicobacter pylori infection. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the principal transmission pathways with the strongest support. Then, I should verify the role of person-to-person and intrafamilial spread. Next, I will examine possible environmental sources and vectors. After that, I should review epidemiologic risk factors and age at acquisition. Finally, I will synthesize a concise clinical summary and ensure the strength of evidence is clear while I double-check for consistency across high-credibility references [^111ysP8F].

> Let me first confirm the major transmission routes so I don't overstate any mechanism. The most consistently supported pathways are fecal-oral and oral-oral transmission, with additional support for gastric-oral spread during episodes of vomiting, and these are explicitly described in high-credibility overviews and reviews of H. pylori pathophysiology and epidemiology [^114HWZu4] [^111ysP8F]. Wait, let me verify the linkage with fecal-oral exposure markers: the seroepidemiologic association of H. pylori with hepatitis A virus, a proxy for fecal-oral exposure, supports this route, although that evidence is observational and of lower credibility compared with guideline-level summaries [^112dusQE]. I should also note that recovery of organisms from vomitus and saliva during rapid gastrointestinal transit supports gastric/oral and oral/oral spread within households, though much of this literature is observational and mechanistic rather than randomized or interventional [^115qTDLP].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — who is transmitting to whom in real-world settings? Person-to-person spread within families appears central, with large family-based datasets demonstrating high intrafamilial prevalence and parents as common sources, which aligns with earlier observations of clustering within households and contact-driven spread [^1143mdmT] [^115qTDLP]. I should confirm that this pattern fits broader natural history: H. pylori is typically acquired in childhood and persists without treatment, which provides a biologically coherent explanation for intrafamilial aggregation and early-life transmission dynamics [^111ysP8F].

> Next, I will examine environmental contributions, but I need to be cautious about the strength of evidence. Environmental transmission via contaminated water is described in high-credibility summaries and is epidemiologically plausible, particularly where sanitation is suboptimal [^114HWZu4]. But wait, what about vectors like cockroaches? Experimental data show viable H. pylori in cockroach excreta for short durations, suggesting possible mechanical transmission, yet this remains low-credibility and indirect evidence, so I should not overinterpret it as a dominant pathway in humans without corroborating epidemiology [^116zdpDw].

> I need to ensure I accurately characterize risk factors that facilitate transmission rather than imply causation where the data are ecological. Low socioeconomic status, household crowding, and poor sanitation are consistently associated with higher prevalence and likely facilitate fecal-oral and oral-oral spread, especially in early childhood, with supportive guidance emphasizing how socioeconomic improvements reduce burden via interruption of transmission [^114HWZu4] [^112huKk5]. Let me reconsider geographic and demographic modifiers: higher prevalence in many developing settings and among certain immigrant and minority populations in high-income countries remains well-documented, likely reflecting early-life exposure patterns and living conditions rather than host biology alone in most contexts [^114HWZu4] [^112huKk5].

> I should double-check the timing of acquisition to align prevention advice with the epidemiology. Most new infections are acquired in childhood, often before age 10, and untreated infections typically persist for life, which reinforces why intrafamilial and early-life hygiene interventions are emphasized in public health narratives and clinical counseling [^113AxkN3] [^111ysP8F] [^114HWZu4]. Hmm, wait a minute — does incidence truly peak that early across settings? While cohort data demonstrate higher seroconversion in early childhood, absolute rates vary by region and living conditions, which still fits the overarching pattern that sanitation and crowding drive earlier acquisition where risk exposures are greater [^113AxkN3] [^112huKk5].

> Let me synthesize and sanity-check the overall conclusions so I don't overstate less certain mechanisms. The dominant causes and routes of H. pylori infection are fecal-oral and oral-oral person-to-person transmission, most commonly within families during childhood, with gastric-oral spread during vomiting episodes providing a plausible short-window mechanism for intrahousehold transmission, particularly in crowded settings with suboptimal hygiene [^114HWZu4] [^115qTDLP] [^111ysP8F]. Environmental transmission via contaminated water may contribute in specific contexts, and potential insect vectoring is experimentally plausible but remains a lower-credibility, non-dominant hypothesis in human populations, so I should frame those as adjunct rather than primary routes [^114HWZu4] [^116zdpDw]. Clinically, risk is amplified by low socioeconomic status, crowding, and inadequate sanitation, while acquisition typically occurs in childhood and persists lifelong if not eradicated, which aligns with observed intrafamilial clustering and supports family-centered prevention and testing strategies where appropriate [^114HWZu4] [^112huKk5] [^111ysP8F].

The most common etiology for H. pylori infection is **person-to-person transmission** within households [^114ZAytC], especially among family members, via **oral-oral and fecal-oral routes** [^114HWZu4] [^112dusQE]. Infection is typically **acquired in childhood** and persists lifelong if untreated [^111ysP8F] [^113AxkN3]. Key risk factors include **low socioeconomic status**, overcrowding, poor sanitation, and contaminated water or food [^114HWZu4] [^112Fepnd]. Environmental reservoirs such as contaminated water and food [^114HWZu4], and vectors like cockroaches, also contribute to transmission [^116zdpDw]. Improving hygiene, sanitation, and living conditions are essential to reduce transmission [^112huKk5].

---

## Primary routes of transmission

H. pylori is **primarily transmitted via person-to-person contact**, particularly within households [^111ysP8F]. The **main routes** include:

- **Oral-oral transmission**: Saliva exchange through shared utensils [^114HWZu4], toothbrushes, or close contact [^114ZAytC].

- **Fecal-oral transmission**: Ingestion of fecally contaminated water or food [^112dusQE] due to poor sanitation and hygiene [^114HWZu4].

- **Gastric-oral transmission**: Exposure to vomitus or gastric secretions, especially during gastroenteritis episodes [^115qTDLP].

---

## Environmental reservoirs and vectors

Environmental factors **significantly contribute** to transmission [^111ysP8F]:

- **Contaminated water**: Drinking water contaminated with fecal matter is a significant reservoir, especially in areas with inadequate sanitation [^114HWZu4] [^111ysP8F].

- **Contaminated food**: Improperly handled or prepared food can harbor H. pylori, facilitating transmission [^114HWZu4].

- **Vectors**: cockroaches and other insects living in unsanitary environments can contaminate food and surfaces with H. pylori [^116zdpDw].

---

## Socioeconomic and demographic risk factors

Several socioeconomic and demographic factors **increase risk** of H. pylori infection [^112Fepnd]:

- **Low socioeconomic status**: Associated with poor sanitation, overcrowding, and limited access to clean water [^114HWZu4] [^112Fepnd].

- **Overcrowding**: High household density facilitates intrafamilial transmission [^114HWZu4] [^112Fepnd].

- **Ethnicity and immigration**: Higher prevalence among non-White populations and recent immigrants from endemic regions [^114HWZu4] [^116Tn32m].

- **Childhood acquisition**: Infection typically occurs in childhood and persists lifelong if untreated [^114HWZu4] [^113AxkN3].

The most common etiology for H. pylori infection is **person-to-person transmission** within households, particularly through oral-oral and fecal-oral routes [^111ysP8F]. Environmental reservoirs such as contaminated water and food, as well as vectors like cockroaches, also play significant roles [^114HWZu4] [^116zdpDw]. Socioeconomic factors, including low socioeconomic status, overcrowding, and poor sanitation, further increase the risk of infection [^112Fepnd] [^112huKk5].

### Serologic evidence for fecal-oral transmission of Helicobacter pylori [^112dusQE]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2016). Low credibility.

Helicobacter pylori infection is among the most prevalent infections in the world and a key cause of gastric diseases; however, its route of transmission remains unclear. This study aimed to assess the potential for fecal-oral transmission of H. pylori by leveraging its association with a disease with known etiology. Utilizing serology data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES 1999; N = 6,347), the association between H. pylori and hepatitis A virus (HAV), a sensitive indicator for fecal-oral exposure, was assessed. Survey-weighted kappa and multiple logistic regression were used to quantify the association between H. pylori and HAV after controlling for age, sex, race, poverty, birthplace, crowding, smoking, and alcohol use. Concordant serological results were found among 69.8% of participants (survey-weighted κ = 0.30, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.26, 0.35). The adjusted odds of H. pylori seropositivity were over two times higher after adjusting for confounders (odds ratio = 2.27, 95% CI = 1.79, 2.87). Results from this study suggest H. pylori and HAV infections are strongly associated. Since HAV is primarily transmitted through the fecal-oral route, fecal-oral transmission may be an important pathway for H. pylori spread.

### Vector potential of cockroaches for Helicobacter pylori infection [^116zdpDw]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2003). Low credibility.

The routes of human infection with Helicobacter pylori remain unclear. In the present study, cockroaches were examined as possible vectors for the transmission of H. pylori.

- **Methods**: We used a common species of cockroach (Periplaneta fuliginosa). After a 3-day fast, cockroaches were placed on agar plates containing freshly grown H. pylori (Sydney strain) (challenge group) or on sterile agar plates without H. pylori (control group). After 24 h of challenge, cockroaches were moved to disinfected containers, and sterile food and water were provided. The external surfaces (legs and body) and excreta of the cockroaches were sampled for culture, rapid urease test, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

- **Results**: H. pylori were culturable from the excreta of the challenge group for 24 h post-challenge. Positive rapid urease test results were obtained up to day 3, and PCR analysis was positive for H. pylori DNA up to day 7 from the excreta. In contrast, H. pylori were not culturable from the external surfaces of the cockroaches. The rapid urease test was positive for only 8 h, and PCR analysis was positive for H. pylori DNA for 1 day from the external surfaces.

- **Conclusions**: Cockroaches usually live in unsanitary environments and may contaminate foods and food containment areas, such as pantries. Transmission of H. pylori infection could be achieved via inadvertent ingestion of foods contaminated with cockroach excreta containing viable H. pylori.

### Helicobacter pylori infection [^114HWZu4]. Deutsches Arzteblatt International (2018). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on Helicobacter pylori infection:

- **Definition**: H. pylori is a Gram-negative bacterium that causes chronic infection and inflammation of the stomach and duodenum.

- **Pathophysiology**: H. pylori infection is transmitted via the fecal-oral and oral-oral routes; horizontal transmission and environmental transmission through contaminated water also occur.

- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of H. pylori infection in North America is decreasing over time but remains substantial at 30–40%. The infection is typically acquired in childhood and is more prevalent among non-White races and ethnicities, those living in crowded or poor sanitary conditions, and early-generation immigrants from countries where H. pylori is endemic. H. pylori resistance rates to antibiotics are increasing in most parts of the world.

- **Disease course**: H. pylori infection is associated with an increased risk of various gastrointestinal diseases including functional dyspepsia, gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, gastric intestinal metaplasia, and gastric cancer.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Although successful eradication of H. pylori infection prevents the development and progression of H. pylori-associated diseases, the efficacy of treatment regimens has decreased due to increased antibiotic resistance. Globally, the annual recurrence, reinfection, and recrudescence rate of H. pylori is 4.3%, 3.1%, and 2.2%, respectively.

### Mechanisms of disease: Helicobacter pylori-related gastric carcinogenesis — implications for chemoprevention [^113dWveR]. Nature Clinical Practice. Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2006). High credibility.

Gastric adenocarcinoma is the second most common cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Infection with Helicobacter pylori is the single most common cause of adenocarcinoma of the distal stomach. Cancer risk is believed to be related to differences among H. pylori strains and inflammatory responses governed by host genetics. In particular, specific interactions between host factors that modulate the response to the infection and bacterial virulence factors that can directly cause tissue damage seem to have a major pathogenic role in the development of gastric cancer.

Environmental factors can also modify key growth signaling pathways within the gastric mucosa, leading to the alteration of epithelial cell growth. Preventive strategies represent the most promising means of decreasing cancer risk and must be aimed at the control of H. pylori infection, improvement of environmental conditions, and identification of subjects who are genetically predisposed to the development of cancer in response to H. pylori infection. Understanding the intracellular signaling pathways specifically affected by H. pylori and that promote phenotypic and genotypic changes that might ultimately progress to malignant transformation could enable physicians to focus eradication therapy appropriately and design interventions targeted at the molecular level to prevent the development of gastric cancer.

### Does helicobacter pylori infection play a role in lung cancer [^117LeMCY]. Respiratory Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Helicobacter pylori infection is a worldwide common disease that leads to many gastrointestinal and respiratory illnesses. It is suggested that one of these respiratory illnesses is lung cancer.

- **Methods**: Forty-three patients with non-small cell lung cancer and 28 control subjects were included in this study. The H. pylori status of the patients and controls was determined by immunoblot for the detection of IgG (RIDA Blot Helicobacter). All subjects were examined to evaluate the presence of VacA and CagA genes.

- **Results**: Seropositivity of anti-H. pylori IgG was significantly higher in cancer patients than in control groups, 40 (93%) and 12 (42%), respectively (P < 0.01). Although both VacA and CagA seropositivity were high in lung cancer patients, only VacA positivity was statistically significant when compared with control subjects, 35 (81%) and 11 (42%), respectively (P < 0.05).

- **Conclusion**: H. pylori infection may be associated with the development of lung cancer.

### Helicobacter pylori infection: detection, investigation, and management [^111iPcpP]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Helicobacter pylori infection causes gastritis and peptic ulcers and is associated with the development of gastric cancer. Approximately 50% of the world population is infected with H. pylori, with the highest prevalence rates in developing countries. In the vast majority of individuals, infection is acquired during childhood, with those of low socioeconomic means and having infected family members being at highest risk for early childhood acquisition. Definitive routes of transmission of the infection are unclear; evidence suggests oral-oral, gastric-oral, and fecal-oral routes. If untreated, H. pylori infection is lifelong. Although clinical disease typically occurs decades after the initial infection acquisition, children infected with H. pylori may have gastritis, ulcers, mucosal-associated lymphoid type lymphoma, and, rarely, gastric atrophy with or without intestinal metaplasia (i.e. both precursor lesions for gastric cancer).

Controversy persists regarding testing for and treating H. pylori, if found, in the large number of children who present with abdominal pain. Because young children (i.e. younger than 5 years of age) who are treated and cured of their H. pylori infection may be at risk for reinfection, the recommendations do not advocate treatment unless an ulcer or gastric atrophy is present. However, despite the lack of clinical evidence, the trend is to more aggressively screen children for the presence of H. pylori and to treat those children who are found to have the infection. H. pylori infection can be eradicated by antimicrobial therapy plus a combination of other treatments.

### Helicobacter pylori. Pathology and diagnostic strategies [^115VU8Lz]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2003). Low credibility.

Helicobacter pylori represents one of the most common and medically significant infections worldwide. Infection with this microaerobic, gram-negative bacterium has been established as an etiologic factor in the development of peptic ulcer disease. Additionally, H. pylori infection has been strongly associated with the development of gastric neoplasia, including gastric adenocarcinomas and gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphomas. Effective antimicrobial treatment depends on sensitive and accurate diagnostic approaches. This review article discusses invasive and noninvasive strategies for the diagnosis of H. pylori infection.

- **Invasive methods**: These require endoscopic evaluation and include bacteriologic culture and susceptibility testing, histopathologic studies, molecular diagnostics, and rapid urease testing.
- **Non-invasive approaches**: These include fecal antigen detection, serologic testing, and urea breath testing.

### Helicobacter pylori infection: An update for the internist in the age of increasing global antibiotic resistance [^114BbQUq]. The American Journal of Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Helicobacter pylori infects approximately half the world's population and is especially prevalent in the developing world. H. pylori is an important cause of global ill health due to its known etiological role in peptic ulcer disease, dyspepsia, gastric cancer, and lymphoma, and more recently, it has been recognized in iron deficiency anemia and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. Increased antibiotic usage worldwide has led to antibiotic resistance among many bacteria, including H. pylori, resulting in falling success rates of first-line anti-H. pylori therapies. Eradication failures are principally due to resistance to clarithromycin, levofloxacin, and metronidazole. Several new treatment options or modifications of established regimens are now recommended by updated practice guidelines for primary or secondary therapy.

Because these updated recommendations were published in the gastroenterological literature, internists and primary care physicians who commonly manage H. pylori may be unaware of these advances. This review outlines the changing epidemiology of H. pylori, advises on diagnostic test selection for patients not undergoing endoscopy, and highlights management options in this era of growing antibacterial resistance.

### Kyoto global consensus report on Helicobacter pylori gastritis [^116TDxwN]. Gut (2015). Low credibility.

H. pylori eradication always confers a benefit by halting the progression of gastric mucosal damage, reducing the reservoir of infected individuals, and reducing or preventing H. pylori-associated diseases. The maximum benefit of eradication for an individual is obtained if done while the H. pylori-induced mucosal damage has not progressed beyond the non-atrophic stage. This population is found in countries where gastric cancer is still prevalent and is concentrated in the younger generation. H. pylori eradication of adolescents and young adults has the additional advantage of reducing or preventing the transmission of the infection to their children.

As noted above (Section 3), the risk for the development of gastric cancer correlates with the extent and severity of atrophic gastritis. It is impossible to define the risk for an individual based on age. Cancer risk in any population relates to the rate of progression of gastric mucosal damage, which is high in populations at high risk of cancer and low in H. pylori-infected populations with a low cancer risk. Thus, while it is possible to identify an average age at which the transition from a non-atrophic to an atrophic phenotype occurs for any population, any age group will contain individuals with a wide range of damage, ranging from uninfected (normal) to advanced atrophy. This emphasizes the need for risk stratification based on objective parameters, including a validated histological staging system rather than on age, to identify whether one eradication treatment is needed.

### H. pylori and gastric cancer: the Asian enigma [^111K8fWT]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

The actual distribution of Helicobacter pylori infection and its related diseases in various Asian countries is controversial. Only limited information is available regarding this issue. We discuss the etiological role of H. pylori in gastric cancer through the Asian experience. Seroprevalence of H. pylori infection in asymptomatic subjects and the annual incidence rate of gastric cancer per 100,000 in various Asian countries are summarized from literature reviews and World Health Organization statistics, respectively.

There is a large intercountry variation in the incidence of gastric cancer and H. pylori seroprevalence among Asian countries. There is a strong link between H. pylori infection and gastric cancer in many countries, such as Japan. By contrast, the prevalence of H. pylori infection is high in some countries, including India and Bangladesh, but low gastric cancer rates have been reported. These disparate observations represent the Asian enigma.

Factors that may influence the etiology of gastric cancer include the genetic diversity of the infecting H. pylori strains and differences in the host genetic background in various ethnic groups, including gastric acid secretion and genetic polymorphisms in proinflammatory cytokines. These factors, in addition to environmental factors, such as personal hygiene and dietary habits, reflect the multifactorial etiology of gastric cancer.

### Helicobacter pylori infection, dementia and primary open-angle glaucoma: Are they connected [^111y6vSh]? BMC Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Alzheimer's disease (AD), the main cause of dementia, affects more than 30 million people worldwide, with a rising tendency toward 100 million estimated sufferers by 2050. Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is the second leading cause of blindness worldwide. Helicobacter pylori is a common, Gram-negative bacterium found in the stomach. It has been shown to elicit an inflammatory response (gastritis) by altering stomach pH and secreting proteases and VacA. It has also been implicated in the development of gastroduodenal ulcer, gastric cancer, MALT lymphoma, and colorectal cancer.

Neurodegenerative disorders are believed to be linked to each other, as well as to H. pylori infection, in terms of epidemiology and etiology. However, various studies investigating the issue have produced contradictory results. For this reason, the aim of this prospective study is to elucidate the putative association between Alzheimer's disease and other dementias (frontotemporal dementia, dementia with Parkinson's disease, and Lewy body dementia), primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), and H. pylori infection in all possible combinations. This will be based on a wide range of diagnostic procedures that ensure accurate and unquestionable diagnosis of each disorder.

### Helicobacter pylori: Resurrection of the cancer link [^112q9T9r]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Helicobacter pylori is one of the most common pathogenic bacterial infections, colonizing an estimated half of all humans. In a subset of individuals, the infection leads to serious gastroduodenal diseases such as peptic ulcers and gastric adenocarcinoma. The factors contributing to skewing this, in most cases benign, relationship into disease development are largely unknown. However, factors emanating from the bacterium, host, and the environment have been shown to affect the risk for disease, although no factor can be singled out as most important. The known factors are associated with affecting the risk of disease and are not absolute.

The virulence of H. pylori is affected by the existence and regulation of certain genes present in the bacterial population in a stomach. The effects of H. pylori on gastric cancer development have been challenged, and the risk associated with infection with virulent (i.e. Cag PAI positive) H. pylori has likely been underestimated.

### Implications of the paradigm shift in management of infections [^112oTtHN]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Helicobacter pylori infections are etiologically related to peptic ulcer, atrophic gastritis, and gastric cancer. Since H. pylori's discovery in the 1980s, antimicrobial therapy for H. pylori infections has primarily been empiric, with potentially effective therapies being identified by trial and error; cure rates were generally low (Figures 1 and 2). It soon became apparent that finding an ideal therapy was going to be difficult as resistance to the commonly used antibiotics developed rapidly and exerted a detrimental effect on cure rates. Antibiotic regimens approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) also often had relatively low cure rates as the focus was on healing peptic ulcers rather than curing the infection. Although H. pylori was declared a carcinogen by the World Health Organization in 1994, the clinical focus remained on peptic ulcer, which at that time was a major health problem. In the United States, gastric cancer was becoming increasingly rare. The concept that curing the infection would also prevent the development of atrophic gastritis, a precursor lesion for gastric cancer, was not immediately recognized.

### Open access endoscopy in an epidemiological situation of high prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection: Applicability of the guidelines of the European Society for Primary Care Gastroenterology [^116oAvp5]. Family Practice (2002). Low credibility.

Dyspepsia is a common syndrome and provides primary care physicians with a significant workload. To optimize the management of dyspepsia, several guidelines have been developed. The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of upper gastrointestinal diseases and their relationship to Helicobacter pylori infection in dyspeptic patients referred for upper endoscopy by family physicians. Additionally, the study assessed the applicability of the guidelines of the European Society for Primary Care Gastroenterology (ESPCG).

A total of 168 unselected dyspeptic outpatients (mean age 38 years, range 18–75), comprising 88 males and 80 females, were included in the study. Two biopsies from the antrum and two from the corpus were taken for histological assessment, and one from the antrum and one from the corpus were taken for culture.

Half of the patients had clinically significant findings at endoscopy: peptic ulcer occurred in 35% of patients under the age of 30 years, in 45% of patients in the age group 30–44 years, and in 36% of patients over 45 years of age. The prevalence of H. pylori infection in these age groups was 67%, 87%, and 89%, respectively. Duodenal ulcers were 12 times more common than gastric ulcers.

The overall incidence of upper gastrointestinal disease, especially among young dyspeptic patients, was high compared with that observed in Western countries. The characteristics of dyspeptic patients consulted in primary care should be used for adaptation of the ESPCG guidelines to local needs.

These mechanisms include manipulation and evasion of host immune responses, alteration of the gastric environment, increased bacterial load, enhanced virulence and consequent adverse gastric histopathology, as well as resistance to antimicrobials. Except for antimicrobial resistance, other H. pylori genetic constituents (e.g. cytotoxin-associated gene A, vacuolating cytotoxin A) have not been leveraged in the management of refractory H. pylori infection but deserve attention.

### Helicobacter pylori infection and related gastrointestinal diseases [^111VEfUC]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Helicobacter pylori has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of digestive tract disorders, such as chronic active gastritis, peptic ulceration, gastric cancer, and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma. Disease outcome is dependent on many factors, including bacterial genotype, host physiology and genetics, and environmental factors such as diet. Researchers continue to explore the complexities of H. pylori infection, seeking to explain why some individuals have asymptomatic infection, whereas others experience clinical disease. The importance of treating H. pylori infection in patients with gastrointestinal problems has been confirmed in recent years, with clinical trials showing that cure of infection can prevent duodenal ulcer and, to a lesser extent, gastric ulcer recurrence; cure early-stage mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma; and reduce the chances of developing gastric cancer in high-risk individuals.

### AGA clinical practice update on the management of refractory Helicobacter pylori infection: Expert review [^115x3zho]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for Helicobacter pylori infection, particularly in the context of treatment failure, the AGA 2021 guidelines recommend ensuring shared decision-making about ongoing attempts to eradicate H. pylori. It is important to carefully weigh the potential benefits of eradication against the likelihood of adverse effects and the inconvenience of repeated antibiotic exposure and high-dose acid suppression, especially in vulnerable populations such as the elderly.

### Age at acquisition of Helicobacter pylori infection: a follow-up study from infancy to adulthood [^113AxkN3]. The Lancet (2002). Low credibility.

Helicobacter pylori infection is common worldwide, but the time of acquisition is unclear. We investigated this issue in a cohort of children selected retrospectively from a population followed up for 21 years.

- **Methods**: We monitored 224 children (99 Black, 125 White; 110 male, 114 female) from 1975–76 (ages 1–3 years) to 1995–96. H. pylori status was assessed by the presence of serum IgG antibodies.

- **Findings**: Eighteen (8.0%) children at age 1–3 years had H. pylori antibodies (13% Black vs. 4% White children, p = 0.008). By age 18–23 years, the prevalence of the infection was 24.5% (43% Black vs. 8% White participants, p < 0.0001). Of the 206 children not infected at baseline, 40 (19%) became infected by age 21–23. The crude incidence rate per year was 1.4% for the whole cohort, ranging from 2.1% at 4–5 years and 1.5% at age 7–9 years to 0.3% at 21–23 years. The seroconversion rate was higher among Black than among White children (relative risk 3.3, 95% CI 1.8–6.2, p = 0.001). The median age for seroconversion was 7.5 years for both races. Nine of the 58 seropositive children cleared the infection during follow-up. The rate of seroreversion per year was 1.1%; it was highest among children at age 4–5 years (2.2% vs. 0.2% at ages 18–19).

- **Interpretation**: Most newly acquired H. pylori infections happened before age 10 years. Treatment and preventive strategies should be aimed at children in this age group.

### Culturing Helicobacter pylori from clinical specimens: Review of microbiologic methods [^1167h1Rk]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2003). Low credibility.

Helicobacter pylori is probably the most common chronic bacterial infection of humankind and is usually acquired first in childhood. Microbiologic culture of H. pylori is the "gold standard" for diagnosis in a patient with suspected infection. Although not currently recommended for routine use, culture allows for testing susceptibility to antimicrobials, especially in populations with a high prevalence of drug resistance. Gastric biopsies are the specimens most commonly used to culture H. pylori, but stool, vomitus, saliva, and dental plaque offer opportunities. This review examines the methods used to culture H. pylori from biologic specimens and suggests useful hints to enhance its recovery rate.

### Management of Helicobacter pylori [^1164LnDP]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

Gastroenterologists, as well as many general internists and primary care physicians, routinely encounter questions regarding the management of Helicobacter pylori. The subject holds global interest and continues to provoke debate and research. Using the search terms 'pylori and treatment' or 'pylori and management', we identified over 1,000 relevant articles in PubMed published between January 1, 2019, and April 30, 2020. We have selected the most clinically relevant of these to review here.

- **Recent findings**: Clinical evidence increasingly supports the benefits of H. pylori eradication in preventing gastric cancer. High resistance rates to clarithromycin and levofloxacin, which correlate with treatment failure in regimens that include these drugs, have led to interest in alternative regimens and the necessity for susceptibility testing of individual patients and populations. Although many aspects of H. pylori management are well-established, implementing appropriate testing and treatment pathways remains suboptimal across healthcare settings.

- **Summary**: There is a need for increased emphasis on measuring H. pylori-related clinical outcomes in practice. This focus is necessary to identify gaps in implementation and suggest ways to best apply knowledge gained for the prevention of gastric symptoms and disease.

### Best treatment approach: Should a national consensus be the best consensus [^114F7fTP]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

A significant number of national and international consensuses have been published in the literature during recent years concerning the treatment of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori). These guidelines are aimed toward achieving an extremely high cure rate (≥ 90%), which seems to be unachievable in real-world settings, especially in areas with high clarithromycin resistance, such as southern Europe. Times change quickly and, as with other infectious diseases, we are moving inevitably from a trial-and-error therapeutic approach to a susceptibility-based one. Empirical first-line treatments should be based on what works best in each geographical and/or national area and must take into account the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in each region.

- **Conclusive suggestions**: We have reviewed the basic conclusive suggestions from the existing guidelines and consensuses worldwide concerning the best anti-H. pylori treatment approach in relation to antibiotic resistance. According to this global plethora of recommendations, it is worth remembering that the determinants of a successful H. pylori eradication could be divided into host-related (e.g. previous antibiotic exposure, patient's adherence to a multi-drug regimen, and/or genetic factors) and H. pylori-related factors, with antibiotic sensitivity appearing to be the most important and consistent predictor of success, both in clinical trials and in population-based studies of H. pylori eradication. Thus, it is of major importance for a country's clinical practitioners to know the local pattern of resistance.

It seems apparent that an understanding of local antibiotic resistance patterns is crucial for effective treatment strategies.

### Helicobacter pylori eradication for the prevention of gastric neoplasia [^113b8PRA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). High credibility.

Gastric cancer is the third most common cause of cancer death worldwide. Individuals infected with Helicobacter pylori have a higher likelihood of developing gastric cancer than those who are not infected. Eradication of H. pylori in healthy asymptomatic individuals in the general population may reduce the incidence of gastric cancer, but the magnitude of this effect is unclear.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effectiveness of eradication of H. pylori in healthy asymptomatic individuals in the general population in reducing the incidence of gastric cancer.

- **Search methods**: We identified trials by searching the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2020, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1946 to February 2020), and EMBASE (1974 to February 2020). We handsearched reference lists from trials selected by electronic searching to identify further relevant trials. Additionally, we handsearched published abstracts from conference proceedings from the United European Gastroenterology Week (published in Gut) and Digestive Disease Week (published in Gastroenterology) between 2001 and 2019. We contacted members of the Cochrane Upper Gastrointestinal and Pancreatic Diseases Review Group and experts in the field and asked them to provide details of outstanding clinical trials and any relevant unpublished materials.

- **Selection criteria**: We analysed randomised controlled trials comparing at least one week of H. pylori therapy with placebo or no treatment in preventing subsequent development of gastric cancer in otherwise healthy and asymptomatic H. pylori-positive adults. Trials had to…

### Antimicrobial resistance incidence and risk factors among Helicobacter pylori-infected persons, United States [^112Fepnd]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

The prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection worldwide is approximately 50%, reaching as high as 80%–90% in developing countries, and about 35%–40% in the United States. Approximately 20% of persons infected with H. pylori develop related gastroduodenal disorders during their lifetime. H. pylori is an etiological agent of peptic ulcer disease, primary gastritis, gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma, and gastric adenocarcinoma. The annual incidence of H. pylori infection is about 4%–15% in developing countries, compared with approximately 0.5% in industrialized countries. Documented risk factors include low socioeconomic status, overcrowding, poor sanitation or hygiene, and living in a developing country.

Eradication therapy for symptomatic H. pylori infection substantially reduces the recurrence of associated gastroduodenal diseases. Therapy entails complicated regimens of several antimicrobial agents for at least two weeks. In general, triple therapy regimens usually include two of the following antimicrobial agents: metronidazole, amoxicillin, tetracycline, or clarithromycin, in combination with a proton pump inhibitor or bismuth. The most common causes of treatment failure are patient noncompliance and antimicrobial resistance of the infecting H. pylori strain. Quadruple regimens are used as a salvage therapy when triple therapy regimens have failed. Pretreatment resistance of H. pylori has been reported to compromise the efficacy of treatment. For example, therapy regimens containing metronidazole and clarithromycin fail in as many as 38% and 55% of cases, respectively, when used.

### Dyspepsia, peptic ulcer, and H. pylori: A remembrance of things past [^113hDFbC]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Dyspepsia and gastroesophageal reflux disease are common conditions in clinical practice. Management strategies emphasize testing and treatment for Helicobacter pylori in the initial management of patients presenting with dyspeptic symptoms in regions where the prevalence of H. pylori infection is greater than 15%. Population-based studies in patients with dyspepsia suggest that peptic ulcer disease related to H. pylori infection is decreasing in prevalence, whereas gastroesophageal reflux disease is becoming a more common cause of dyspeptic symptoms. Unfortunately, symptoms are a poor predictor of endoscopic findings, and alarm features are not a good predictor of an underlying malignancy. Although peptic ulcer disease has declined in Western countries, specific populations such as immigrants and rural communities may have a high prevalence of infection and peptic ulcer disease that needs to be considered in initial dyspepsia management, even in areas where the general prevalence of H. pylori infection has declined below 15%.

### Helicobacter pylori in health and disease [^113D2emF]. Gastroenterology (2009).

Helicobacter pylori is highly adapted for colonization of the human stomach and is present in about half of the human population. When present, H. pylori is usually the numerically dominant gastric microorganism. H. pylori typically does not cause any adverse effects, but it is associated with an increased risk of noncardia gastric adenocarcinoma, gastric lymphoma, and peptic ulcer. Disorders such as esophageal diseases and childhood-onset asthma were recently reported to occur more frequently in individuals who lack H. pylori than in H. pylori-positive persons.

In this review, we discuss biologic factors that allow H. pylori to colonize the human stomach, mechanisms by which H. pylori increases the risk of peptic ulcer disease and noncardia gastric adenocarcinoma, and potential benefits that H. pylori might confer to humans.

### Gastroenteritis and transmission of Helicobacter pylori infection in households [^115qTDLP]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Helicobacter pylori infects at least 50% of the world's population. Infection occurs in early life, but because acute infection invariably passes undetected, the precise age of acquisition is unknown. In industrialized countries, infection rates are declining rapidly; however, high rates of infection persist among disadvantaged and immigrant populations.

The mechanisms of H. pylori transmission are incompletely characterized. Person-to-person transmission is most commonly implicated, with fecal/oral, oral/oral, or gastric/oral pathways, each supported by both biologic and epidemiologic evidence. Like many common gastrointestinal infections, infection is associated with conditions of crowding and poor hygiene, as well as with intrafamilial clustering. The organism has been recovered most reliably from vomitus and from stools during rapid gastrointestinal transit. These findings support the hypothesis that gastroenteritis episodes provide the opportunity for H. pylori transmission.

Household transmission of gastroenteritis is common in the United States, particularly in homes with small children. If H. pylori is transmitted person to person, it is expected that rates of new infection would be elevated after exposure to individuals with H. pylori–infected cases of gastroenteritis. To explore whether diarrhea or vomiting contributes to disease transmission, we monitored northern Californian households experiencing gastroenteritis for new H. pylori infections, evaluating the contributions of household H. pylori infection and gastroenteritis to new infection.

Regarding the medical management of Helicobacter pylori infection, specifically concerning first-line regimens, the CAG 2016 guidelines recommend administering any of the following regimens for 14 days as first-line therapy in patients with H. pylori infection:

- **Clarithromycin triple therapy**: PPI, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin.
- **Traditional bismuth quadruple therapy**: PPI, bismuth, metronidazole, and tetracycline.
- **Non-bismuth quadruple therapy**: PPI, amoxicillin, metronidazole, and clarithromycin.

### Helicobacter pylori [^1143Tt1Z]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Helicobacter pylori is an important human pathogen responsible for most peptic ulcer disease, gastritis, and gastric malignancies. H. pylori has several unique features: it is highly adapted for gastric colonization, yet it produces clinical consequences in a small minority. Its genome is known, and it is the only bacterium strongly associated with cancer. H. pylori is therefore of great interest to clinicians and researchers from many, often disparate, disciplines. Recent advances in this fast-changing field come from many different areas.

- **Recent findings**: The major contentious clinical issues relate to the synergistic gastrotoxic interactions of H. pylori with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and a possible association of H. pylori with atherosclerotic events. Accumulating evidence implicates genetic variation in the inflammatory response to H. pylori in the etiology of the increased risk of gastric cancer after H. pylori infection. Studies of pathogenesis have been aided by increasingly sophisticated murine models. The effects in gastric epithelial cells of two major virulence factors, genes within the cag pathogenicity island and the vacuolating cytotoxin VacA, illustrate the complex network of cellular reactions activated by H. pylori. The metabolism of H. pylori is dependent on the availability of hydrogen.

- **Summary**: Basic science research into H. pylori continues to elucidate the mechanisms by which H. pylori infection causes disease. These findings have implications for the design of novel therapies and for improving current treatments.

### Helicobacter pylori: Perspectives and time trends [^114MxMV7]. Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2014). Low credibility.

The discovery of Helicobacter pylori three decades ago is a modern medical success story. It markedly changed our understanding of the pathophysiology of gastroduodenal diseases and led to an improvement in the treatment of diseases related to H. pylori infection. Many of these diseases, such as ulcer disease and mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma, have become curable, and others, like gastric cancer, might be preventable with the application of H. pylori eradication therapy. Since its discovery, H. pylori has also been identified as a trigger for some extragastric diseases. Promising results in this exciting field might have a clinical effect in the near future. This timeline gives an overview of the success of clinical research on H. pylori at the time of writing and highlights some future trends in this area.

### CagA-positive Helicobacter pylori strains and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease: Still puzzling [^111rW53H]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2004). Low credibility.

Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) and Helicobacter pylori infection are both common in Western countries. A recently published meta-analysis has shown an association between an absence of H. pylori infection and GORD symptoms. Infection with cagA-positive H. pylori strains is a causative factor for the development of duodenal ulcers and is a risk factor for gastric cancer. Data about a protective role of cagA-positive H. pylori strains against more severe reflux oesophagitis are documented in several studies but questioned by some other studies. There is a need for further studies to clarify the definite role of cagA-positive H. pylori strains in severe reflux oesophagitis and their possible effect on the development of Barrett's adenocarcinoma.

The role of Helicobacter pylori in gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) is still discussed controversially. Different factors might be responsible for the remarkably heterogeneous results of previously performed studies, such as location, environmental factors, and different virulence factors of H. pylori strains. A very recently published meta-analysis has shown a significant association between the absence of H. pylori infection and GORD symptoms, and a positive correlation between anti-H. pylori therapy and the occurrence of both de-novo and rebound/exacerbated GORD. The results of this meta-analysis are questioned by some authors because of single larger trials and geographical variations of the studies analyzed. Data on the role of the cytotoxic-associated antigen (cagA)-positive H. pylori strains are contradictory.

### Epidemiology of Helicobacter in Chinese families: A foundation for cost-effective eradication strategies [^1143mdmT]. Gut (2024). High credibility.

The recent 'Chinese Consensus Report on Family-based Helicobacter pylori Infection Control and Management (2021 Edition)' and 'Large-scale, National, Family-based Epidemiological Study on Helicobacter pylori Infection in China: The Time to Change Practice for Related Disease Prevention' encourage more doctors in China to consider Helicobacter pylori as a curable etiology for gastrointestinal symptoms and as a smart way to prevent gastric cancer in the aging population. The paper is based on the results of a very large new study of H. pylori prevalence in China, whereby investigators completed a China-wide breath-test survey of 10,735 families. Unfortunately, 70% of families had at least one positive family member, although younger, educated, and Eastern-China families had less, with 28% of persons being infected but only 20% of children being infected. In contrast, some northwestern provinces had 85% of families infected, and 19% had all family members infected. The parents seemed to be the main source, with mother and father equally. Food serving habits had only a very minor effect on prevalence.

H. pylori is the primary cause of gastric cancer, which is still the fourth most common cause of cancer-related death. Every year, about 1,089,103 new gastric cancer cases are diagnosed worldwide, with about 478,508 cases located in China alone. In China, the H. pylori prevalence is lower (approximately 30%–50%) along the wealthier coastal cities and higher (approximately 50%–80%) among the inner cities. Gansu, one of the poorest provinces in China, has the highest prevalence of H. pylori.

### Hellenic consensus on infection [^117NYY2d]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

Since its isolation in 1983, Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection has become a significant area of research in gastroenterology. Its role in both benign and malignant gastric diseases, as well as its extragastric manifestations, is well recognized worldwide. The epidemiology of H. pylori varies globally, and ongoing research continues to evolve. Consequently, various scientific boards have organized consensus meetings of experts to publish relevant guidelines. These guidelines are undoubtedly useful for clinicians in their practice. However, considering local differences, it is crucial for national scientific gastroenterological societies to organize their own consensus meetings and adapt guidelines for their specific countries. To this end, the Hellenic Society of Gastroenterology recently organized the "Hellenic consensus on H. pylori infection". The aim of this publication is to present guidelines that support the local gastroenterology community in managing H. pylori infection.

### Helicobacter pylori: Evidence-based review with a focus on immigrant populations [^116Tn32m]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Helicobacter pylori has been causally linked to a number of diseases, including peptic ulcer disease, gastric adenocarcinoma, mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma, and dyspepsia. It is the most prevalent bacterial pathogen in humans, and while the overall prevalence in the United States is about 30%, the distribution is heterogeneous among different ethnic groups. Recent immigrants from high-prevalence areas such as Korea, Japan, and China bear an increased burden of its disease and complications. There is clear evidence that treatment of H. pylori resolves peptic ulcer disease, and increasing evidence for protection against the development of gastric adenocarcinoma. However, H. pylori treatment failure is common and alternative regimens may be necessary. This case-based review will highlight these issues, including the epidemiology of H. pylori in the immigrant population, an approach to dyspepsia, and the role of H. pylori in gastric adenocarcinoma.

### Infection and esophageal adenocarcinoma: A review and a personal view [^113Bgy6a]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a common bacterium and infects almost half of the global population, being strongly associated with upper gastrointestinal morbidity. Its prevalence remains high in most countries; approximately 4.4 billion individuals were infected worldwide in 2015, and H. pylori continues to be highly prevalent in certain ethnic populations and among migrants from high prevalence countries. The primary pathogenic role of H. pylori in peptic ulcer formation is supported by robust evidence. In 1994, H. pylori was recognized as a class I carcinogen for gastric cancer by the International Agency for Research on Cancer and the World Health Organization. Additionally, numerous studies have implicated H. pylori in a range of systemic disorders, including cardio-cerebrovascular, degenerative, and metabolic syndrome (MetS)-related conditions. The accumulated oncology literature also suggests an etiological connection between H. pylori and extra-gastric neoplasms, such as pancreatic, colorectal, and esophageal cancers, at least in some subpopulations.

Esophageal cancer is among the most frequent neoplasms and a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. It is a clinically challenging disease that requires a multidisciplinary approach. Esophageal cancer is divided into two histological types: esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), which is mostly associated with environmental risk factors such as smoking and alcohol consumption, and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), located close to the gastroesophageal junction.

### Hellenic consensus on infection [^115kwHCb]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

The Hellenic Society of Gastroenterology recently organized the "Hellenic consensus on Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection". The aim of this publication is to report the guidelines to aid the national gastroenterology community in managing H. pylori infection. Forty-one delegates from all Greek regions, including gastroenterologists, pathologists, clinical microbiologists, epidemiologists, and basic scientists, were invited to this meeting.

The participants were allocated to one of the four main topics of the meeting: H. pylori diagnosis and association with diseases; H. pylori and gastric cancer; H. pylori and extragastric associated disorders; and H. pylori treatment. The results of each subgroup were submitted to a final consensus vote that included all participants. Relevant data based on international and Greek publications were presented, and the quality of evidence, strength of recommendation, and level of consensus were graded. A cutoff level of 70% was considered for acceptance of the final statement.

It is hoped that the recommendations and conclusions of this report will guide Greek doctors in their daily practice concerning the management of H. pylori infection.

### Real-time quantitative PCR for detection of Helicobacter pylori [^1155HKG8]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2002). Low credibility.

Helicobacter pylori is one of the most common chronic infections in humans, where it plays a key role as an etiological factor in peptic ulcer disease, gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma, and gastric adenocarcinoma. Humans are the bacterium's only host. In this study, we report the development of a real-time quantitative (Q) PCR-based assay to measure ureC gene copy number for detecting H. pylori, as there is only one copy of the ureC gene per bacterium.

Upon optimization of LightCycler Q-PCR conditions, we achieved a standard curve with a linear range (correlation coefficient = 1) across six logs of DNA concentration. This allowed us to accurately quantify as few as 1,000 bacteria. Analysis of variance on 15 randomly selected clinical samples demonstrated good reproducibility of this assay.

- **Comparison of Q-PCR results**: The results were compared with bacterial culture and histopathological data from an additional 85 clinical biopsy samples, showing a significant difference in the presence of H. pylori. Many samples negative for H. pylori by culture and histopathology were positive by Q-PCR. However, contamination of PCR by H. pylori or its genetic material could not be ruled out.

In summary, we developed a rapid, sensitive, and real-time Q-PCR method for detecting H. pylori. This technique significantly improves the detection of H. pylori in clinical and research samples over other available methods.

### Helicobacter pylori and antimicrobial resistance: Molecular mechanisms and clinical implications [^114CxAAa]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Helicobacter pylori is an important human pathogen that colonizes the stomach of about half of the world's population. The bacterium is recognized as the causative agent of several gastroduodenal disorders, ranging from chronic active gastritis and peptic ulcer disease to gastric cancer. The recognition of H. pylori as a gastric pathogen has significantly impacted gastroenterological practice, transforming many previously untreatable gastroduodenal disorders of uncertain cause into curable infectious diseases. Treatment of H. pylori infection results in ulcer healing and can reduce the risk of developing gastric cancer.

Although H. pylori is susceptible to many antibiotics in vitro, only a few antibiotics can effectively cure the infection in vivo. The frequent indication for anti-H. pylori therapy, coupled with the limited choice of antibiotics, has led to the development of antibiotic resistance in H. pylori. This resistance substantially hinders the treatment of H. pylori-associated disorders. Antimicrobial resistance in H. pylori is widespread, with regional variations in prevalence per antibiotic, reaching as high as 95%. We focus on the treatment of H. pylori infection and examine the clinical relevance, mechanisms, and diagnosis of antimicrobial resistance.

### Helicobacter pylori World Gastroenterology Organization global guideline [^112huKk5]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Helicobacter pylori remains a major health problem worldwide, causing considerable morbidity and mortality due to peptic ulcer disease and gastric cancer. The burden of disease falls disproportionately on less well-resourced populations. As with most infectious diseases, the largest impact on reducing this burden comes from improvements in socioeconomic status, which interrupt transmission. This has been observed in many regions of the world; however, the prevalence of infection remains high in areas where improvements in living standards are slow to occur.

Meanwhile, the optimal clinical management and treatment pathways remain unsettled and are evolving with changing antimicrobial resistance patterns. Despite decades of research and clinical practice, major challenges persist. The quest for the most effective, safe, and simple therapy remains the primary issue for clinicians. The search for an effective vaccine appears to be elusive still. Clinical guidelines frequently proffer discordant advice. A major challenge for guidelines is ensuring relevance across a variety of populations with varying spectrums of disease, antimicrobial resistance rates, and vastly different resources.

As local factors are central to determining the impact and management strategies for H. pylori infection, it is important that pathways are based on the best available local knowledge rather than solely extrapolating from guidelines formulated in other regions, which may be less applicable. To this end, this revision of the World Gastroenterology Organisation (WGO) H. pylori guideline uses a comprehensive approach tailored to diverse populations worldwide.

### Evolving concepts in Helicobacter pylori management [^115mknV7]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Helicobacter pylori is the most common chronic bacterial infection worldwide and the most significant risk factor for gastric cancer, which remains a leading cause of cancer-related death globally. H. pylori and gastric cancer continue to disproportionately impact racial and ethnic minority and immigrant groups in the United States. The approach to H. pylori case-finding has relied on opportunistic testing based on symptoms or high-risk indicators, such as racial or ethnic background and family history. However, this approach misses a substantial proportion of individuals infected with H. pylori who remain at risk for gastric cancer because most infections remain clinically silent. Moreover, individuals with chronic H. pylori infection are at risk for gastric preneoplastic lesions, which are also asymptomatic and only reliably diagnosed using endoscopy and biopsy.

Thus, to make a significant impact in gastric cancer prevention, a systematic approach is needed to better identify individuals at the highest risk of both H. pylori infection and its complications, including gastric preneoplasia and cancer. The approach to H. pylori eradication must also be optimized, given sharply decreasing rates of successful eradication with commonly used therapies and increasing antimicrobial resistance. With growing acceptance that H. pylori should be managed as an infectious disease and the increasing availability of susceptibility testing, we now have the momentum to abandon empirical therapies that have demonstrated inadequate eradication rates. Molecular-based susceptibility profiling facilitates…

### Helicobacter pylori: Gastric cancer and beyond [^112tjUJQ]. Nature Reviews Cancer (2010). Low credibility.

Helicobacter pylori is the dominant species of the human gastric microbiome, and colonization causes a persistent inflammatory response. H. pylori-induced gastritis is the strongest singular risk factor for cancers of the stomach; however, only a small proportion of infected individuals develop malignancy. Carcinogenic risk is modified by strain-specific bacterial components, host responses, and/or specific host-microbe interactions. Delineation of bacterial and host mediators that augment gastric cancer risk has profound ramifications for both physicians and biomedical researchers, as such findings will not only focus prevention approaches that target H. pylori-infected human populations at increased risk for stomach cancer but will also provide mechanistic insights into inflammatory carcinomas that develop beyond the gastric niche.

### Helicobacter pylori and risk of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111dyZcu]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is the most common chronic bacterial infection. Patients with H. pylori infection may be at an increased risk of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) because of chronic inflammation and insulin resistance. Several epidemiologic studies attempting to determine this risk have yielded inconsistent results. This meta-analysis was conducted with the aim to summarize all available evidence and estimate the risk of NAFLD in patients with H. pylori infection.

- **Methods**: A literature search was performed using the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases from inception to June 2016. Studies that reported relative risks, odds ratios, or hazard ratios comparing the risk of NAFLD among patients with H. pylori infection versus those without were included. Pooled odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using a random-effect, generic inverse variance method.

- **Results**: Six studies met our eligibility criteria and were included in this analysis. We found a statistically significant increased risk of NAFLD among patients with H. pylori infection, with pooled odds ratios of 1.21 (95% confidence interval, 1.07–1.37). The statistical heterogeneity was low, with an I² of 49%.

- **Conclusions**: A significantly increased risk of NAFLD among patients with H. pylori infection was demonstrated in this meta-analysis. Further studies are required to clarify how this risk should be addressed in clinical practice.

### Kyoto global consensus report on Helicobacter pylori gastritis [^115YAUbr]. Gut (2015). High credibility.

H. pylori is a major human pathogen that causes chronic and progressive gastric mucosal damage and is etiologically related to peptic ulcer, gastric cancer, and gastric atrophy. It is also closely associated with gastric MALT lymphoma, dyspepsia, hyperplastic gastric polyps, and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. H. pylori-positive individuals are significant reservoirs for the transmission of the infection.

The decision to eradicate a chronic infection in society should be based on quantitative data regarding the outcomes of untreated infections. H. pylori causes a chronic infection, similar to asymptomatic syphilis or tuberculosis, and the final outcome for any individual cannot be predicted. Unlike many other chronic infectious diseases, H. pylori infection is always transmissible, thus posing a risk to others. Because gastric damage is progressive, the absence of obvious clinical manifestations at diagnosis has no predictive value for the lifetime risk to an individual patient, their family, or the community.

Benefits of H. pylori eradication for an individual depend partly on the degree and extent of damage that has already occurred and the reversibility of that damage. Potential benefits of eradication include stopping the progression of mucosal damage, stabilizing or reducing the risk of developing gastric cancer, resolving mucosal inflammation, stabilizing or improving gastric mucosal function, returning normal mechanisms governing acid secretion, curing H. pylori-related peptic ulcer disease, and reducing the risk of gastrointestinal complications.

### Pathogenesis of Helicobacter pylori infection [^112FL3CM]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Helicobacter pylori infects over half of the world population. Infection with this bacterium causes gastritis and peptic ulcer disease and is associated with the development of gastric cancers. However, only a small proportion of individuals develop these complications from the infection. Therefore, identification of both host and bacterial factors that mediate disease is an intense area of research interest. This review highlights recent advances in the understanding of the mechanisms underlying disease pathophysiology following infection with H. pylori.

### AGA clinical practice update on the management of refractory Helicobacter pylori infection: Expert review [^117BMfs9]. Gastroenterology (2021). Low credibility.

Failure to eradicate H. pylori results from the complex interaction of host-, microbial-, and systems-related factors. Antibiotic resistance (microbial and systems) and patient nonadherence (host and systems) are the two most commonly cited reasons for eradication failure. However, because primary eradication failure still occurs despite confirmed antibiotic sensitivity and patient adherence, potentially with higher frequency in refractory H. pylori specifically, additional factors are likely also relevant. Providers should attempt to identify all contributing etiologies before simply prescribing alternative antibiotics. These factors, along with antibiotic resistance and nonadherence, are described herein.

### AGA clinical practice update on the management of refractory Helicobacter pylori infection: Expert review [^116eiVLj]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Regarding quality improvement for Helicobacter pylori infection, particularly concerning local susceptibility assessment, the AGA 2021 guidelines recommend compiling local data on H. pylori eradication success rates for each regimen. This includes patient demographic and clinical factors, such as prior non-H. pylori antibiotic exposure. Aggregated data should be made publicly available to guide the local selection of H. pylori eradication therapy.

Regarding the medical management of Helicobacter pylori infection, particularly first-line regimens, the CAG 2016 guidelines recommend against using the following regimens as first-line therapy in patients with H. pylori infection:

- **Sequential non-bismuth quadruple therapy**: PPI and amoxicillin followed by PPI, metronidazole, and clarithromycin.
- **Levofloxacin triple therapy**: PPI, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin.

### Natural history and symptomatology of Helicobacter pylori in childhood and factors determining the epidemiology of infection [^113eCb6j]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2006). Low credibility.

High seroprevalence rates for Helicobacter pylori have been reported in developing countries; however, few studies exist determining the pattern of change in the epidemiology of H. pylori infection in children. Knowledge of the acquisition and loss rates of H. pylori, as well as its relevance to sociodemographic properties and the symptomatology of infection, may provide clues for lifestyle changes that might protect children from infection. It may also provide rationale for eradication, screening, and protection policies. Our aim was to conduct a prospective study to elucidate the outcome, rate of acquisition, and loss of H. pylori infection in a population of healthy children.

- **Methods**: This study is based on follow-up of 327 healthy Turkish children aged 3 to 12 years. The follow-up was conducted 6 years after the baseline examination. Helicobacter pylori status was determined by C-urea breath test. Children were investigated for sociodemographic variables and several symptoms.

- **Results**: Data from 136 (41%) of 327 children were available. The prevalence of infection increased from 52.9% to 56.6%, mainly increasing in children younger than 10 years. The incidence of H. pylori infection among previously uninfected children was 14%, and the loss rate of infection among previously infected children was 5.5% during the follow-up. Socioeconomic status, household density, and antibiotic use during the last 6 months were inversely related to H. pylori prevalence. Children infected with H. pylori complained more often of headache but not of abdominal pain or dyspepsia.

### The second Irish Helicobacter pylori working group consensus for the diagnosis and treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection in adult patients in Ireland [^112d5Y9j]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). Low credibility.

The Gram-negative bacterium Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infects the stomach of almost 50% of individuals globally and causes chronic gastritis. In 2015, the Kyoto H. pylori consensus defined H. pylori gastritis as an infectious disease. Although chronic active infection leads to structural and functional changes in the gastric mucosa, most individuals remain asymptomatic. H. pylori infection increases the risk of developing peptic ulcers, gastric adenocarcinoma, and gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma, and it has been grouped as a class I carcinogen by the WHO. Vitamin B12 deficiency, unexplained iron-deficiency anaemia, and certain cases of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura are also associated with H. pylori infection. While the prevalence of H. pylori has decreased in many parts of the world, the management of H. pylori infection remains a challenge.

The Irish H. pylori working group (IHPWG) was established in 2016 and comprises gastroenterologists, microbiologists, and pharmacists with expertise in H. pylori infection. The first consensus recommendations on the management of H. pylori infection specific to the Irish healthcare setting were published in 2017. Since then, many important updates have been published on the prevalence of H. pylori antimicrobial resistance and the eradication success rates of different treatment regimens. In light of these findings, international consensus guidelines have been updated. Thus, the aim of this study was to reconvene the IHPWG to review the most up-to-date literature relating to the management of H. pylori infection.

### Helicobacter pylori: What do we still need to know [^111dPsh1]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Helicobacter pylori is a common gastric infection that causes serious complications in a minority of individuals. A great deal is known about the disease, but many unanswered questions remain. Among these, perhaps the most enigmatic is that we do not know how the organism is transmitted. We are uncertain why the prevalence of the disease is falling within the developed population. There is still debate as to its relationship with gastroesophageal reflux disease. It is unclear why there are differences in the international incidence of gastric cancer. Similar uncertainties relate to the reasons why the complications of H. pylori infection have changed over time.

In this article, I have hypothesized that a number of these unanswered questions may be related to a putative increase in gastric acid secretion that may have taken place during the past 200 years. At the time of writing, there is little confirmatory evidence for this, and it remains a fascinating area that merits more scientific research.

### Global prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection between 1980 and 2022: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^11338V4x]. The Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2023). Low credibility.

Few studies have examined the temporal trends of Helicobacter pylori prevalence worldwide. We aimed to identify the changes in global prevalence of H. pylori infection between 1980 and 2022.

- **Methods**: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, Embase, MEDLINE, Scopus, and Web of Science, with no language restrictions, for observational studies on the prevalence of H. pylori infection published between Jan 1, 1980, and Dec 31, 2022. Conference papers, meta-analyses, reviews, and case reports were excluded. We divided the study timeframe into four periods: 1980–90, 1991–2000, 2001–10, and 2011–22. Summary data were extracted from each selected publication. The prevalence of H. pylori and its temporal trend were analyzed according to WHO region, World Bank income level, WHO universal health coverage service coverage index of the country or region, sex and age of the patient, study type, and diagnostic method. The pooled prevalence was estimated by a random-effects meta-analysis, and the significance of the associated factors was analyzed by multivariable meta-regression.

- **Findings**: Of the 56,967 records identified, 5,236 were included in the quality assessment stage, and 224 studies — from 71 countries or regions from all six WHO regions and including 2,979,179 individuals — were included in the final analysis. Significant heterogeneity was found between studies (I² = 99.9%). The estimated global prevalence of H. pylori…

### Helicobacter pylori: an evolutionary perspective [^1136FRnq]. Histopathology (2021). Low credibility.

Since the description of Helicobacter pylori (HP) as the most common cause of gastritis and its neoplastic complications, numerous articles have been written about the epidemiology, clinical features, diagnostic methods, histopathology, pathogenesis, molecular biology, and treatment of this infection. This review focuses on those aspects of the infection that challenge the universality of the medical implications through the lens of evolutionary science applied to medicine.

The divergent epidemiological and clinical outcomes observed in different populations and the possible beneficial aspects of the infection are discussed. Correa's seminal contributions to our understanding of gastric cancer in particular and postinflammatory tumors in general are also reviewed, along with the renewed interest in intestinal metaplasia and its clinical implications.

### Helicobacter pylori infection [^111ysP8F]. Nature Reviews Disease Primers (2023). High credibility.

Helicobacter pylori infection causes chronic gastritis, which can progress to severe gastroduodenal pathologies, including peptic ulcer, gastric cancer, and gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma. H. pylori is usually transmitted in childhood and persists for life if untreated. The infection affects around half of the world's population, but prevalence varies according to location and sanitation standards. H. pylori has unique properties that enable it to colonize gastric epithelium in an acidic environment.

The pathophysiology of H. pylori infection depends on complex bacterial virulence mechanisms and their interaction with the host immune system and environmental factors. This interaction results in distinct gastritis phenotypes that determine the possible progression to different gastroduodenal pathologies. The causative role of H. pylori infection in gastric cancer development presents the opportunity for preventive screen-and-treat strategies.

Invasive, endoscopy-based, and non-invasive methods, including breath, stool, and serological tests, are used to diagnose H. pylori infection. Their use depends on the specific individual patient history and local availability. H. pylori treatment consists of a strong acid suppressant in various combinations with antibiotics and/or bismuth. The dramatic increase in resistance to key antibiotics used in H. pylori eradication demands antibiotic susceptibility testing, surveillance of resistance, and antibiotic stewardship.

### Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and Helicobacter pylori or gastro-oesophageal reflux disease from Helicobacter pylori [^113p3Ry4]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2001). Low credibility.

Helicobacter pylori, the most common source of chronic infection worldwide, is a principal aetiological agent of type B gastritis, gastric and duodenal ulcers, and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphomas; the presence of this pathogen is also associated with gastric carcinoma. Infection with H. pylori is prevalent in patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) even though it does not appear to play an important role in GORD pathophysiology.

Epidemiological studies have shown that colonization with cagA-positive H. pylori provides significant protection against the development of GORD and its long-term complications. Whereas clinical trial results indicate that the presence of H. pylori has little influence on the effectiveness of antisecretory therapy with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) in patients with GORD, a meta-analysis of results from long-term studies suggests that the risk of GORD relapse may be reduced in the presence of H. pylori infection.

Several investigators have raised concerns about an increased risk for gastric neoplasia in H. pylori-positive patients treated with PPIs. However, long-term follow-up of such patients indicates neither significant risk of neoplasia nor accelerated development of gastric glandular atrophy. Thus, the excellent safety record of these compounds seems not to be compromised by the presence of H. pylori.
