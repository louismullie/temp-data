## Question

A 29-year-old woman presents to the outpatient clinic with a 3-month history of abdominal pain, frequent non-bloody diarrhea (6-8 times daily), weight loss of 7 kg, and fatigue. She has no perianal disease or extraintestinal manifestations. Laboratory studies reveal elevated C-reactive protein and anemia. Colonoscopy confirms moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease involving the terminal ileum and ascending colon. She has never received biologic agents or immunomodulators, but was previously treated with a short course of corticosteroids with only partial improvement. She is concerned about long-term steroid use and wants to discuss her options for inducing remission.

Based on current guideline recommendations, what is the most appropriate pharmacologic approach to induce remission in this patient? Justify your answer with reference to the patient's treatment history and guideline recommendations.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the most appropriate pharmacologic approach to induce remission in a 29-year-old woman with moderate-to-severe ileocolonic Crohn's disease who had a partial response to a short steroid course and wants to avoid long-term steroids. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about disease severity and location to confirm the indication for advanced therapy. Then, I should verify what major guidelines say about induction options and whether they still endorse steroids as first-line. Next, I will weigh the risks of continued or repeated steroid exposure and the evidence for steroid-sparing induction. After that, I should compare biologic classes and consider combination strategies. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, guideline-concordant recommendation with dosing and monitoring, and I will double-check for any nuances I might miss along the way.

> Let me first confirm the disease phenotype and severity. Moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease with terminal ileum and ascending colon involvement, active systemic features (weight loss, fatigue), elevated CRP, and anemia supports the need for potent induction beyond steroids, and the prior partial steroid response underscores the risk of steroid dependence without disease-modifying therapy [^4bfebf96] [^0e81ee2f].

> Wait, let me verify the role of steroids in current practice. Guidelines still allow short-course systemic corticosteroids for induction, but they emphasize minimizing exposure and transitioning promptly to steroid-sparing agents; importantly, steroids do not maintain remission and carry substantial toxicity with repeated or prolonged use, so relying on them risks dependency and complications [^4bfebf96] [^2aa22007] [^7335578d].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about first-line induction in 2024–2025. I initially thought guidelines might still prioritize steroids, but I should double-check the contemporary stance. Multiple high-credibility guidelines now recommend advanced therapies early for moderate-to-severe disease rather than repeated steroid courses, reflecting treat-to-target principles and the limitations of steroids; ECCO 2024, BSG 2025, and ACG 2025 all endorse biologics for induction in this setting, and AGA suggests against requiring failure of conventional therapy before starting advanced therapy, which aligns with moving directly to biologics in appropriate patients [^949cf72e] [^822936cd] [^649a7977] [^c42b7018].

> I need to check which advanced therapies are appropriate for induction. Anti-TNF agents (infliximab, adalimumab) and anti-IL12/23 (ustekinumab) are recommended for induction in moderate-to-severe CD, with risankizumab (anti-IL23) also endorsed by ECCO and BSG; vedolizumab is an option, though BSG advises against its use for induction in moderate-to-severe CD, so I should be cautious about positioning it first-line here [^949cf72e] [^822936cd] [^c67b83f1] [^f1015d6e].

> Next, I should review combination therapy considerations. For infliximab, guidelines favor combination with a thiopurine to reduce immunogenicity and improve pharmacokinetics, whereas for adalimumab, monotherapy is generally preferred in biologic-naïve patients; I should confirm that this nuance is consistent across sources, and yes, ECCO and BSG align with infliximab combination and adalimumab monotherapy in biologic-naïve patients [^27aad41e] [^62b8f82d] [^822936cd].

> Let me consider the patient's priorities and risk profile. She wants to avoid long-term steroids and has already had a partial steroid response, which increases the likelihood of steroid dependence if steroids are continued; early introduction of a biologic with a steroid-sparing plan addresses this, and treat-to-target strategies that include objective monitoring (CRP, fecal calprotectin) are reasonable to adopt in follow-up [^0e81ee2f] [^e69aa9c9].

> I should confirm the practical induction choice and dosing. Given biologic-naïve status, moderate-to-severe ileocolonic disease, and the need to minimize steroid exposure, adalimumab monotherapy is a strong option with robust RCT evidence for induction; alternatively, infliximab with a thiopurine is guideline-endorsed and may optimize durability, though it requires infusions and monitoring. If anti-TNF is undesirable, ustekinumab is a reasonable alternative with strong guideline support for induction and maintenance [^ff516c53] [^27aad41e] [^b9920334].

> But wait, what if I am overstating the need to avoid steroids entirely? I should verify whether a short bridging steroid course is ever acceptable. Yes, a brief, tapering steroid bridge can be considered for rapid symptom control while advanced therapy takes effect, but it should be limited to under 8 weeks and not used as maintenance; this balances short-term benefit against long-term harm and is consistent with BSG and ACG guidance [^2ce7b539] [^4bfebf96].

> Next, I should review maintenance planning to ensure continuity. After induction remission, continuation of the biologic is recommended for maintenance; thiopurines or methotrexate can be considered if biologic therapy is not feasible or as part of combination strategies in selected cases, with TPMT testing before thiopurines and attention to hepatotoxicity and myelosuppression monitoring; this aligns with ACG and ECCO maintenance recommendations [^34b8dd19] [^1f32a5c2].

> Final recommendation: I should double-check that my synthesis is consistent with guidelines. The most appropriate, guideline-concordant approach is to initiate an advanced therapy now rather than repeat steroids, with adalimumab 160 mg subcutaneously at week 0, 80 mg at week 2, then 40 mg every other week starting week 4 as a preferred first-line option in this biologic-naïve patient; alternatively, infliximab with a thiopurine or ustekinumab are acceptable choices depending on patient preference, access, and comorbidities, and a short steroid taper may be used only as a bridge while the biologic takes effect, not exceeding 8 weeks and not for maintenance [^ff516c53] [^27aad41e] [^b9920334] [^2ce7b539] [^4bfebf96].

---

The most appropriate pharmacologic approach to induce remission in this 29-year-old woman with moderate-to-severe ileocolonic Crohn's disease and steroid-refractory symptoms is to **initiate a biologic agent** (adalimumab, infliximab, ustekinumab, or risankizumab) [^949cf72e] [^822936cd] [^e08365c1] as first-line induction therapy, with **combination therapy** (biologic plus thiopurine or methotrexate) considered for high-risk patients or those with prior steroid dependence [^27aad41e] [^ab9f74af]. Systemic corticosteroids are not recommended for induction in steroid-refractory disease due to limited efficacy and significant adverse effects [^notfound]; if used, they should be limited to a short course with early taper and transition to steroid-sparing therapy [^4bfebf96]. Budesonide is not appropriate for moderate-to-severe disease because of inferior efficacy compared with systemic steroids and lack of benefit in severe or colonic disease [^e61561ed] [^ec3c9805]. Thiopurine monotherapy is not recommended for induction due to low efficacy and slow onset [^fee74ebe] [^374f62ff].

---

## Rationale for biologic therapy

Biologic agents are recommended as **first-line therapy** for moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease, particularly in patients who are steroid-refractory or steroid-dependent, because of their superior efficacy in inducing and maintaining remission compared with conventional therapies [^949cf72e] [^822936cd]. The following biologics are recommended for induction of remission:

- **Anti-TNF agents**: Adalimumab and infliximab are effective for induction and maintenance of remission in moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease [^ff516c53] [^822936cd].

- **Ustekinumab**: Recommended for induction and maintenance of remission, particularly in patients with prior anti-TNF exposure or intolerance [^b9920334] [^8e21c230].

- **Risankizumab**: A newer IL-23 inhibitor, recommended for induction and maintenance of remission in moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease [^e08365c1].

---

## Role of combination therapy

Combination therapy with a biologic agent and an immunomodulator (thiopurine or methotrexate) is recommended in specific scenarios, such as patients with high-risk features (e.g. young age, extensive disease, prior steroid dependence) or those initiating infliximab therapy, to **reduce immunogenicity and enhance efficacy** [^27aad41e] [^ab9f74af]. However, combination therapy should be individualized based on patient risk factors, preferences, and tolerance to immunomodulators.

---

## Limitations of corticosteroids

Corticosteroids, including systemic prednisone, are not recommended for induction of remission in steroid-refractory patients due to limited efficacy and significant adverse effects, including increased risk of infections, osteoporosis, and metabolic disturbances [^4bfebf96] [^2aa22007]. If corticosteroids are used, they should be limited to a short course (≤ 8 weeks) with early taper and transition to steroid-sparing therapy [^2ce7b539] [^4bfebf96].

---

## Inappropriateness of budesonide

Budesonide, a controlled-release corticosteroid with limited systemic bioavailability, is **not recommended** for moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease because of inferior efficacy compared with systemic corticosteroids, particularly in severe disease or colonic involvement [^e61561ed] [^ec3c9805]. Budesonide is primarily indicated for mild-to-moderate ileocecal disease and is not effective in maintaining remission [^f1964bfd] [^7335578d].

---

## Role of thiopurines and methotrexate

Thiopurines (azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine) and methotrexate are effective for maintenance of remission but are **not recommended for induction** of remission due to slow onset of action (12–16 weeks) and limited efficacy in active disease [^fee74ebe] [^374f62ff]. They may be considered as adjuncts to biologic therapy in selected patients to reduce immunogenicity and enhance efficacy [^27aad41e] [^feee99e5].

## Summary of recommendations

| **Therapy** | **Indication** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|-|
| Biologic agents (adalimumab, infliximab, ustekinumab, risankizumab) | Induction of remission in moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease | Strongly recommended |
| Combination therapy (biologic + immunomodulator) | High-risk patients or infliximab initiation | Considered |
| Systemic corticosteroids | Steroid-refractory disease | Not recommended |
| Budesonide | Moderate-to-severe disease | Not recommended |
| Thiopurines, methotrexate | Induction of remission | Not recommended |

---

The most appropriate pharmacologic approach to induce remission in this patient is to **initiate a biologic agent** (adalimumab, infliximab, ustekinumab, or risankizumab) as first-line therapy, with combination therapy considered in high-risk patients or those with prior steroid dependence. Systemic corticosteroids and budesonide are not recommended for induction in this scenario due to limited efficacy and significant adverse effects.

### Moderate to severe disease (...) [^b28a53bf]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

Mild to Moderate Disease Mild to moderate Crohn's disease can be treated with a salicylate preparation, and in patients who are unresponsive, an antibiotic may help. 5 Response to therapy should be evaluated after several weeks; patients who do not respond should be treated for moderate to severe disease or with alternative therapy. 7 Both mesalamine preparations are generally more effective than placebo in improving disease symptoms and inducing remission in patients with active Crohn's disease; however, greater benefit is seen in patients with ileitis versus colitis or ileocolitis. 8 The dosage of oral mesalamine is 3. 2 to 4 g per day. In the treatment of mild to moderate active Crohn's disease, antibiotic therapy may be an acceptable alternative. Metronidazole in a dosage of 10 to 20 mg per kg per day has demonstrated benefit in the treatment of ileocolitis and colitis, with most patients reporting clinical improvement and more than one half achieving remission.

11 In addition to a metallic taste, disulfiram-like effect, and gastrointestinal upset, long-term use of metronidazole is known to cause peripheral neuropathy, and patients should be monitored. Ciprofloxacin in a dosage of 1 g per day has also decreased disease activity similar to that of mesalamine, 4 g per day. 12 In a study 13 of patients with active Crohn's disease, no difference was noted between patients treated with a combination of ciprofloxacin and metronidazole, and those treated with prednisone at 12 weeks.
13. Moderate to Severe Disease Patients with Crohn's disease that is classified as moderate to severe should be treated with steroids until symptoms resolve and weight loss is reversed. The immunomodulators azathioprine and mercaptopurine may be used, but full response may not be achieved for several months.

Infliximab may be an alternative if corticosteroids are ineffective or contraindicated. Oral corticosteroids have been the mainstay for treating moderate to severe active Crohn's disease. Their effectiveness in inducing remission has long been known, and their onset of action is more rapid than that of salicylates. While studies have not revealed a generally accepted dosage schedule, 50 to 70 percent of patients receiving the equivalent of prednisone 40 mg daily over eight to 12 weeks have been shown to achieve a clinical response. 9 After clinical response, dosage is tapered according to rapidity and completeness of response, often requiring months to discontinue. 14 Dosages can be tapered by 5 to 10 mg weekly until 20 mg, and by 2. 5 to 5 mg weekly thereafter. 14 Steroids have no role in maintaining remission.

In addition, concerns regarding the long-term side effects of steroid use, including diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis, and adrenal suppression, limit their long-term use. Prednisone enemas may be helpful in proctosigmoid disease but are not as effective as salicylate preparations. The role of immunomodulators in Crohn's disease continues to be studied. Immunosuppressants, specifically azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine, have demonstrated adjunctive benefits to use of steroids in adults, . Dose-response studies have yet to establish optimal dosages of azathioprine and mercaptopurine. Although often used at lower dosages, the benefits of azathioprine have been demonstrated at 2 to 2. 5 mg per kg, 20 and at
1. 5 mg per kg with 6-mercaptopurine. 22 Patients should have blood counts evaluated once a month to watch for leukopenia. In addition, patients are at risk of pancreatitis, which generally can occur at the induction of therapy.

Prednisone-equivalent dosing for active disease ranges from 40 to 60 mg/d, and the use of corticosteroids should not exceed 3 continuous months without attempting to introduce corticosteroid-sparing agents. Even short-term use may be accompanied by adverse events including venous thromboembolic events (5-fold increased risk). Despite effectiveness for symptom control, nearly 1 in 4 patients will have prolonged exposure to corticosteroids (greater than 6 months) with approximately 15% of patients becoming steroid-dependent.

Importance

Treatment of Crohn disease is rapidly evolving, with the induction of novel biologic therapies and newer, often more intensive treatment approaches. Knowing how to treat individual patients in this quickly changing milieu can be a challenge.

Objective

To review the diagnosis and management of moderate to severe Crohn disease, with a focus on newer treatments and goals of care.

Evidence Review

MEDLINE was searched from 2000 to 2011. Additional citations were procured from references of select research and review articles. Evidence was graded using the American Heart Association level-of-evidence guidelines.

Results

Although mesalamines are still often used to treat Crohn disease, the evidence for their efficacy is lacking. Corticosteroids can be effectively used to induce remission in moderate to severe Crohn disease, but they do not maintain remission. The mainstays of treatment are immunomodulators and biologics, particularly anti-tumor necrosis factor.

Conclusion and Relevance

Immunomodulators and biologics are now the preferred treatment options for Crohn disease.

### Corticosteroids in Crohn's disease [^2aa22007]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

Crohn's disease is a lifelong illness characterized by chronic recurrent flares. The precise etiology of Crohn's disease is unknown. However, it appears to involve an enhanced systemic immune response and intensified local intestinal mucosal inflammatory activity, mediated through various inflammatory cells and an array of proinflammatory cytokines. Corticosteroids have been the mainstay of treatment of Crohn's disease. The controlled trials of the National Cooperative Crohn's Disease Study and the European Cooperative Crohn's Disease Study established that corticosteroids were effective for the induction of remission in Crohn's disease for the duration of the studies (6-17 wk). However, corticosteroids have not been shown to have an impact on the maintenance of long term remission in patients with Crohn's disease. In addition, they are associated with a high potential for dependence and serious toxic side effects. Alternative classes of medical therapy for Crohn's disease, including modified corticosteroids and a group of new biological therapies, have proven to be efficacious in the management of active and/or quiescent Crohn's disease.

### Effectiveness and safety of vedolizumab induction with or without budesonide in patients with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease in Europe: a retrospective observational study [^7916fe11]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis, commonly referred to as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), are inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract and may develop due to complex interactions of inadequate immunological responses, genetic susceptibility, and environmental triggers. Pharmacological treatment for CD involves a wide range of therapeutic agents with varying mechanisms of action including conventional (e.g. corticosteroids and immunomodulators) or advanced therapies (e.g. monoclonal antibodies and small molecules). An update on the Selecting Therapeutic Targets in IBD (STRIDE-II) initiative of the International Organization for the Study of IBD recommends achieving a clinical response as an immediate treatment target for patients with IBD. In addition to defining the appropriate medical treatment according to disease site and activity, the choice of medication for CD treatment is influenced by factors such as the balance between drug efficacy and potential side effects, previous response to treatment (in case of a relapse, or for a steroid-dependent or steroid-refractory disease), the presence of extraintestinal manifestations or complications, as well as the costs and benefit/risk ratio of each drug.

In clinical practice, induction of advanced therapies (e.g. monoclonal antibodies) such as vedolizumab (VDZ) with corticosteroids may improve clinical response and remission rates in patients with CD. VDZ is a gut-selective anti-lymphocyte trafficking integrin antibody with an attractive safety profile that is recommended for inducing response and remission in patients with moderately to severely active CD who have an inadequate response to conventional therapy and/or to anti–tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents, or for maintaining clinical remission in patients who have achieved clinical remission with VDZ [,–]. Corticosteroids such as budesonide (BUD) have been recommended for inducing clinical remission in patients with active mild-to-moderate CD [,–]. BUD is a second-generation corticosteroid recommended for mild-to-moderate CD located at the ileum and/or ascending colon. It has been shown to have high topical anti-inflammatory activity, fewer glucocorticoid-associated side effects, and less suppression of pituitary–adrenal function compared with systemic corticosteroids.

### Inducing remission in inflammatory bowel disease [^b6f09702]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2003). Low credibility.

Around 2-4 in 1,000 people in Northern Europe have ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. Both are chronic relapsing inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal tract and share several clinical features. However, they are largely distinct in their risk factors, their genetic, immunological, anatomical and histological features, and their response to medical and surgical therapy. Their treatment is usually considered in two phases: the induction of remission in an acute attack, and the long-term maintenance of remission. In 2001, we discussed maintenance treatment in adults. We now discuss the induction of remission, concentrating on newer therapeutic approaches.

Crohn’s disease—upfront combined immunosuppression versus step therapy outcomes are reported across randomized and pragmatic trials and a meta-analysis. In D’Haens et al, corticosteroid- and surgery-free remission at 52 weeks occurred in 40 of 65 patients (61.5%) with upfront combined immunosuppression versus 23 of 64 (42.2%) with step-up therapy (RR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.46–0.97). In REACT-1, steroid-free remission at 12–24 months did not differ significantly, but disease-related adverse events were lower with combined strategies (HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.62–0.86). In PROFILE, primary outcomes favored upfront combined immunosuppression for steroid- and surgery-free remission (79% vs 15%; P < .001) and endoscopic healing (67% vs 44%; P < .001). A meta-analysis including 2497 individuals across 3 clinical trials found clinical remission at 12 months was uncertain between strategies (66.4% vs 60.6%; RR, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.96–1.46), with a possible lower risk of disease-related complications at 12 months with early combination therapy (17.7% vs 14.8%; RR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.29–1.34).

Clinical outcomes and Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (CDAI) thresholds—remission and safety outcomes were prioritized, with patient preferences and CDAI-based disease activity definitions specified. Achieving endoscopic remission, corticosteroid-free remission and serious adverse events (SAEs) were considered important outcomes. Research suggests that patients perceive improving quality of life and symptom resolution as their primary treatment objectives; only 12.8% prioritize normalization of colonoscopy as a treatment objective. In clinical trials, clinical remission was most commonly measured using the Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (CDAI), based on abdominal pain, bowel movements, general well-being, complications of disease, abdominal mass, anemia, and weight change. CDAI scores <150 suggest clinical remission, and scores 150–220, 221–450, and >450 denote mild, moderate, and severe disease, respectively. For strategy questions, maintaining clinical remission and preventing disease-related complications at 1 year were deemed to be the critical outcomes.

Moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease—immunomodulator maintenance and testing: We suggest azathioprine (at doses of 1.5–2.5 mg/kg/d) and 6-mercaptopurine (at doses of 0.75–1.5 mg/kg/d) for maintenance of remission in patients with moderately to severely active CD who had induction of remission with corticosteroids (conditional recommendation, low level of evidence). We recommend thiopurine methyltransferase testing before initial use of azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine to treat patients with CD (strong recommendation, low level of evidence). We suggest methotrexate (up to 25 mg once weekly intramuscular or subcutaneous) for maintenance of remission in patients with moderately to severely active CD who had induction of remission with corticosteroids (conditional recommendation, moderate level of evidence).

4.4 Maintenance treatment in ileocolonic Crohn’s disease

Statement 38. We recommend that systemic or locally acting corticosteroids should be avoided as maintenance therapy in Crohn’s disease due to toxicity and lack of efficacy (GRADE: strong recommendation, high-quality evidence. Agreement: 100%).

Irrespective of whether remission is induced surgically or medically, corticosteroids are not effective in maintaining remission in Crohn’s disease compared with placebo (see Section 5.2.8.1: Overuse of corticosteroids). Systematic reviews and pooled trial data show that budesonide does not reduce relapse rates over a 12-month period.One systematic review did show a modest reduction in CDAI scores, but this was outweighed by a significant increase in adverse events and adrenocortical suppression compared with the placebo groups.

4.4.1 Immunomodulator therapy

Statement 39. We recommend that for patients with moderate to severe Crohn’s disease responding to prednisolone, early introduction of maintenance therapy with thiopurines (GRADE: strong recommendation, low-quality evidence) or methotrexate (GRADE: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence) should be considered to minimise risk of flare as prednisolone is withdrawn (Agreement: 93.3%).

Relapse of Crohn’s disease is common on corticosteroid withdrawal, particularly in moderate to severe disease, and early initiation of corticosteroid-sparing therapy is appropriate. Immunomodulators such as azathioprine, mercaptopurine or methotrexate are effective in the maintenance of remission of Crohn’s disease.

4.4.1.1 Thiopurine therapy

Statement 40. We recommend that azathioprine or mercaptopurine can be used as monotherapy in the maintenance of remission in Crohn’s disease (GRADE: strong recommendation, low-quality evidence. Agreement: 100%).

Thiopurines should not be used for induction of remission in active Crohn’s disease. Thiopurines are more effective than placebo in maintenance of remission in Crohn’s disease but the Cochrane analysis reports low quality evidence (NNT=9).A systematic review and network meta-analysis also showed the benefit of azathioprine/mercaptopurine compared with placebo in remission maintenance (OR 1.7 (95% CI 1.3 to 2.6)), although anti-TNF therapy was significantly more effective than thiopurines.

### ACG clinical guideline: management of Crohn's disease in adults [^feee99e5]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Moderate-to-severe Crohn’s disease—immunomodulator recommendations: We recommend against azathioprine (at doses of 1.5–2.5 mg/kg/d) and 6-mercaptopurine (at doses of 0.75–1.5 mg/kg/d) for induction of remission in moderately to severely active CD (strong recommendation, moderate level of evidence). For maintenance after corticosteroid-induced remission, we suggest azathioprine (1.5–2.5 mg/kg/d) and 6-mercaptopurine (0.75–1.5 mg/kg/d) for maintenance of remission in patients with moderately to severely active CD who had induction of remission with corticosteroids (conditional recommendation, low level of evidence), and we suggest methotrexate (up to 25 mg once weekly intramuscular or subcutaneous) for maintenance of remission in patients with moderately to severely active CD who had induction of remission with corticosteroids (conditional recommendation, moderate level of evidence). We recommend TPMT testing before initial use of azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine to treat patients with CD (strong recommendation, low level of evidence). In combination therapy contexts, azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, or methotrexate may be used in treatment of active CD as adjunctive therapy for reducing immunogenicity associated with anti-TNF therapy.

### ACG clinical guideline update: ulcerative colitis in adults [^60e530ff]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Ulcerative colitis in adults—conclusions outline disease characterization and management, noting that UC is an idiopathic chronic inflammatory condition of the recto-colon and colon with variable activity and severity and significant morbidity. Appropriate management involves successful induction of both clinical and endoscopic remission followed by use of a corticosteroid-free maintenance strategy and ongoing monitoring for disease and drug-related complications. Choice of therapy is based on activity, severity, extent of inflammation and prognostic factors, and may include oral, topical (rectal), or systemic therapies, as well as surgery. Patients with moderate-to-severe disease should be treated early in their disease course with therapies that have been shown to be effective and should not linger with suboptimal therapy or recurrent courses of corticosteroids. In general, the induction therapy selected drives the choice of maintenance therapy. Positioning considerations include a single head-to-head trial in moderately to severely active UC, separation of induction and maintenance strategies for some patients with ASUC, and considerations of comorbid or concomitantly existing extraintestinal manifestations. We advocate for preservation of the clinician-patient shared decision-making approach to therapy selection and exclusion of limitations imposed by third-party payers.

### A review of the therapeutic management of Crohn's disease [^ec3c9805]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

In 1994, a newer glucocorticoid formulation, budesonide, was shown to have equal efficacy to prednisolone,with a 15 times greater affinity for glucocorticoid receptors, such that 5 mg of budesonide is equivalent to 12 mg of prednisolone.Budesonide has an added advantage of a high first pass liver metabolism and rapid elimination, resulting in minimal systemic absorption and thereby reducing the risk of steroid-induced side effects.While budesonide 9 mg once daily has been shown to be superior than placebo in inducing remission for patients with mild to moderate ileocaecal CD (OR: 2.92, 95% CI: 1.52–5.39),, budesonide was inferior to prednisolone for the induction of clinical remission in severe ileocaecal CD or in colonic CD (relative risk (RR): 0.52, 95% CI: 0.28–0.95).

Corticosteroids remained the mainstay for induction therapy until the late 1990swhen evidence began showing that they only induce complete clinical remission in 48% and partial clinical remission in 32% of patients with active CD.However, 20% of patients were found to be resistant from the onset, and at 1-year follow-up, 45% of the patients who responded initially became steroid-dependent with only 32% of patients maintaining a prolonged clinical response.It became rapidly apparent that corticosteroids were ineffective at maintaining remission, reducing flares, or disease recurrence.– The French GETAID study provided further proof that corticosteroids were not disease-modifying agents with limited evidence in their ability to achieve endoscopic mucosal healing or preventing endoscopic relapse.In this study, patients were given prednisolone 1 mg/kg for 7 weeks, and only 29% achieved endoscopic and clinical remission, with 71% showing active endoscopic lesions. In fact, 9% of patients had worsening endoscopic lesions despite symptomatic improvement.All of the above limitations associated with prolonged corticosteroid use make a compelling case for using newer safer therapies that maintain remission without exposing patients to unwanted side effects.

### Advances in the treatment of Crohn's disease [^7a3618dd]. Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

The medical therapy of Crohn's disease has improved considerably in recent years. In large part, this is due to the introduction of new efficacious agents, both "biologics" and traditional small molecules. Further study of older drugs has also advanced our ability to devise the optimum approach to individual Crohn's disease patients by better clarifying the benefits, adverse effects, and means to optimize doses of established medications. In this review, we present an evidence-based approach to the medical management of active Crohn's disease, Crohn's disease in remission, and perianal Crohn's disease that emphasizes recent advances that have come from the results of randomized controlled clinical trials.

4.2.1 Budesonide in ileocaecal Crohn’s disease

Statement 32. We recommend that mild to moderate ileocaecal Crohn’s disease can be treated with ileal-release budesonide 9 mg once daily for 8 weeks to induce remission (GRADE: strong recommendation, high-quality evidence. Agreement: 100%).

In a randomised double-blind trial, ileal-release budesonide 9 mg once daily for 8 weeks was as effective as prednisolone (40 mg daily tapering to 5 mg at 8 weeks) at inducing remission in patients with mild-to-moderate ileocaecal Crohn’s disease with treatment efficacy (CDAI score <150) of 51% on budesonide at 8 weeks compared with 52.5% for prednisolone,and significantly fewer side effects. Multiple meta-analyses have also demonstrated the efficacy of budesonide 9 mg/day over placebo in inducing remission.A once-daily 9 mg dose is as effective as 3 mg three times daily.In the context of more severe disease (CDAI >300) budesonide is inferior to prednisolone (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.95).When remission has been achieved, budesonide should be tapered over 1–2 weeks.

4.2.2 Corticosteroids in colonic Crohn’s disease

Statement 33. We recommend that active Crohn’s colitis can be treated with an 8-week course of systemic corticosteroids to induce remission (GRADE: strong recommendation, high-quality evidence. Agreement: 100%).

In mild, moderate and severe colonic Crohn’s disease, systemic corticosteroids such as prednisolone are effective in inducing remission.A starting dose of 40 mg tapering by 5 mg weekly is often used, but should be tailored to disease severity and patient tolerance. Ileal-release budesonide does have benefit in Crohn’s disease affecting the proximal colon,but there is no evidence of benefit in more distal colonic inflammation. There are no trials of colonic-release budesonide-MMX in Crohn’s disease at present.

### Budesonide for induction of remission in Crohn's disease [^6f3174b0]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Corticosteroids continue to play a central role in induction of remission in active Crohn's disease. However, their use comes at a price of significant adverse effects when used repeatedly or for extended periods. Newer corticosteroid agents with limited systemic bioavailability offer a tantalizing option, if they can be shown to be efficacious and safer than conventional corticosteroids. Budesonide is the main alternative corticosteroid currently available in an enteric formulation.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness of oral budesonide for the treatment of acute flares of Crohn's disease. A secondary but important endpoint was to evaluate the adverse effect profile.

Search Strategy

The following sources were used to search the literature for potentially relevant papers and trials. 1. A computer-assisted search of the on-line bibliographic database MEDLINE from 1986 onwards. 2. Hand searching the reference lists of trials and review articles identified by means of the computer- assisted search. 3. Proceedings from major gastrointestinal meetings were manually searched from 1990 onwards. 4. Contact with the relevant pharmaceutical companies that have been involved in the development of budesonide.

Selection Criteria

Potentially relevant articles were reviewed in an independent unblinded fashion by two authors to determine if they met the criteria specified below: 1) STUDY POPULATION: Patients of any age with acutely active Crohn's disease, as defined by a CDAI > 150. 2) METHODOLOGY: Randomized double blind controlled trials comparing budesonide to a control treatment. Patients in the control arm may have received placebo, conventional corticosteroids, 5-aminosalicylic acid or sulfasalazine. 3) OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical remission was the outcome measure of interest. The definition of remission was usually a CDAI < 150 by 8 to 16 weeks of therapy.

Data Collection and Analysis

Eligible articles were reviewed in duplicate and the results of the primary research trials were abstracted onto specially designed data extraction forms. The proportion of patients achieving remission in the active treatment and control groups of each study were derived from the data provided in the original research papers. Where possible, data were broken down based on site of disease or other strata used by the individual trials.

Statistical Analysis

Data extracted from the original research articles were converted, where necessary, into individual 2 x 2 tables (remission versus no remission x budesonide versus control) for each of the individual studies. Where available, individual 2 x 2 tables for strata within studies were also used. The presence of significant heterogeneity among studies was tested for using the chi-square test. Because this is a relatively insensitive test for the presence of heterogeneity, a p-value of 0.10 was regarded as statistically significant. Where p < 0.10 the data from the individual studies were still combined but the pooled results were interpreted with caution. The 2 x 2 tables were synthesized into a summary test statistic using the pooled odds ratio and 95% confidence intervals as described by Cochran and Mantel and Haenszel. A fixed effects model was used for the pooling of data. The analysis was performed initially by combining data from all trials to estimate the response rate to budesonide therapy. The analysis was also performed by combining only studies with comparable control groups.

Main Results

Eight studies were deemed eligible for review.

Efficacy

Budesonide was superior to placebo for induction of remission with a pooled odds ratio for the two placebo-controlled trials of 2.85 (95% CI 1.67 - 4.87). A single trial comparing budesonide with mesalamine demonstrated an odds ratio of 2.80 (95% CI 1.50 - 5.20) in favour of budesonide over mesalamine for induction of remission in active Crohn's disease. However, budesonide was inferior to conventional corticosteroids (prednisone or prednisolone) for induction of remission with a pooled odds ratio for the five trials of 0.69 (95% CI 0.51 - 0.95).

Safety

The two trials comparing budesonide versus placebo (Greenberg 1994; Tremaine 2002) showed no difference between study groups for proportion of reported corticosteroid-related adverse effects with the pooled odds ratio for both trials of 0.98 (95% CI 0.58 - 1.67). Five trials comparing budesonide versus prednisone showed the budesonide study group had fewer reported corticosteroid-related adverse effects than the prednisone study group (pooled odds ratio was 0.38 (95% CI 0.28 - 0.53).

Authors' Conclusions

With disease in the ileum or ascending colon, budesonide offers an effective therapy which is somewhat less efficacious but with fewer adverse effects than conventional corticosteroids (e.g. prednisone, prednisolone, or 6-methylprednisolone).

### Methotrexate for induction of remission in refractory Crohn's disease [^788d88a7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Although corticosteroids are effective for induction of remission of Crohn's disease, approximately 20% of patients who respond relapse when steroids are withdrawn and become steroid dependent (Binder 1985). Furthermore, corticosteroids exhibit significant adverse effects. The success of methotrexate as a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis led to its evaluation in patients with refractory Crohn's disease. Methotrexate has been studied for induction of remission of refractory Crohn's disease and has become the principal alternative to azathioprine/6MP therapy. The evidence for its effectiveness has not been subjected to a systematic review.

Objectives

To conduct a systematic review of the evidence for effectiveness of methotrexate for induction of remission in patients with active Crohn's disease in the presence and absence of concomitant steroid therapy.

Search Strategy

A computer-assisted search of MEDLINE and EMBASE for relevant studies published in English, French, Spanish, Italian and German between 1966 and July 2004. Manual searches of reference lists from potentially relevant papers were performed to identify additional studies. The Cochrane Controlled Trials Register and the IBD Review Group Specialized Trials Register were also searched.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials involving patients of age > 17 years with refractory Crohn's disease defined by conventional clinical, radiological and endoscopic criteria, which was categorized as being active (Crohn's disease activity index >150).

Outcome Measures

The outcome measure was the rate of induction of remission and complete withdrawal from steroids in the treatment and control groups after > 16 weeks of treatment. A secondary outcome was induction of remission with reduction in steroid dose of at least 50%. Selection of trials: The results of the searches above were reviewed independently by two observers and relevant studies selected according to the predefined selection criteria. Any disagreement among reviewers was resolved by consensus. The same two reviewers assessed the methodological quality of each trial (details of randomization method, including whether intention-to-treat analysis was possible from the published data, number of patients lost to follow-up, and if a blinded outcome assessment was used). A standard data extraction form was used. Appropriateness of combining results: Trials were first reviewed to assess the clinical comparability of trial protocols and study populations.

Main Results

Five randomized trials were identified. The five studies differed with respect to participants, intervention, and outcomes to the extent that it was considered to be inappropriate to combine the data statistically. Three small studies which employed low doses of methotrexate orally showed no statistically significant difference between methotrexate and placebo/control medication treated patients. One small study which used a higher dose of intravenous/oral methotrexate showed no statistically significant difference between methotrexate and azathioprine. A larger study which employed a higher dose of methotrexate intramuscularly showed substantial benefit (number needed to treat, NNT=5). Adverse effects were more common with high dose intramuscular methotrexate therapy than with placebo.

Authors' Conclusions

There is evidence from a single large randomized trial on which to recommend the use of methotrexate 25 mg intramuscularly weekly for induction of remission and complete withdrawal from steroids in patients with refractory Crohn's disease. Although adverse effects were more common than with placebo, they were not severe. There is no evidence on which to base a recommendation for use of lower dose oral methotrexate.

Crohn's disease is a chronic and progressive immune-mediated disease with increasing incidence worldwide. There are no curative therapies. The primary agents used in the treatment of Crohn's disease are aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, immunomodulators, and biologics. Each agent has different roles in the induction and maintenance of remission of disease. The biologics available include anti-TNF agents, anti-integrins, and anti-interleukins. The choice of initial biologic therapy should be determined through shared decision-making between the patient and provider.

### Oral budesonide in the management of Crohn's disease [^767afff8]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety of oral budesonide (Entocort EC) in the treatment of mild to moderate Crohn's disease (CD).

Data Sources

The MEDLINE database (1966-December 2002) was searched using the key words budesonide and inflammatory bowel diseases and restricted to the English language. The references from relevant articles were also reviewed for additional citations.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Articles and abstracts that evaluated oral budesonide for management of CD were considered, with emphasis on randomized, controlled clinical trials.

Data Synthesis

Budesonide's high potency at the glucocorticoid receptor and extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism result in a topical antiinflammatory effect on intestinal tissue, with minimal systemic glucocorticoid adverse effects. Clinical trials have demonstrated that budesonide is effective in the treatment of patients with mild to moderate CD of the ileum and ascending colon, with efficacy similar to prednisolone and superior to mesalamine. Long-term therapy with budesonide increased the duration of CD remission, but the effect was not sustained up to 1 year. Budesonide failed to prevent postsurgical relapse of CD. Adrenal suppression and glucocorticoid-related adverse effects have been reported at lower rates in patients treated with budesonide compared with prednisolone. Patients prescribed budesonide should be monitored for hepatic dysfunction and potential drug interactions.

Conclusions

Budesonide is an effective and relatively safe option for treatment of mild to moderate CD of the ileum and ascending colon.

### Aminosalicylates for induction of remission or response in Crohn's disease [^6a251d58]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Randomized trials investigating the efficacy of aminosalicylates for the treatment of mildly to moderately active Crohn's disease have yielded conflicting results. A systematic review was conducted to critically examine current available data on the efficacy of sulfasalazine and mesalamine for inducing remission or clinical response in these patients.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy of aminosalicylates compared to placebo, corticosteroids, and other aminosalicylates (alone or in combination with corticosteroids) for the treatment of mildly to moderately active Crohn's disease.

Search Methods

We searched PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE and the Cochrane Central Library from inception to June 2015 to identify relevant studies. There were no language restrictions. We also searched reference lists from potentially relevant papers and review articles, as well as proceedings from annual meetings (1991-2015) of the American Gastroenterological Association and American College of Gastroenterology.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials that evaluated the efficacy of sulfasalazine or mesalamine in the treatment of mildly to moderately active Crohn's disease compared to placebo, corticosteroids, and other aminosalicylates (alone or in combination with corticosteroids) were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data extraction and assessment of methodological quality was independently performed by the investigators and any disagreement was resolved by discussion and consensus. We assessed methodological quality using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The overall quality of the evidence supporting the outcomes was evaluated using the GRADE criteria. The primary outcome measure was a well defined clinical endpoint of induction of remission or response to treatment. Secondary outcomes included mean Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) scores, adverse events, serious adverse events and withdrawal due to adverse events. For dichotomous outcomes we calculated the pooled risk ratio (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) using a random-effects model. For continuous outcomes we calculated the mean difference (MD) and 95% CI using a random-effects model. Sensitivity analyses based on a fixed-effect model and duration of therapy were conducted where appropriate.

Main Results

Twenty studies (2367 patients) were included. Two studies were judged to be at high risk of bias due to lack of blinding. Eight studies were judged to be at high risk of bias due to incomplete outcomes data (high drop-out rates) and potential selective reporting. The other 10 studies were judged to be at low risk of bias. A non-significant trend in favour of sulfasalazine over placebo for inducing remission was observed, with benefit confined mainly to patients with Crohn's colitis. Forty-five per cent (63/141) of sulfasalazine patients entered remission at 17-18 weeks compared to 29% (43/148) of placebo patients (RR 1.38, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.89, 2 studies). A GRADE analysis rated the overall quality of the evidence supporting this outcome as moderate due to sparse data (106 events). There was no difference between sulfasalazine and placebo in adverse event outcomes. Sulfasalazine was significantly less effective than corticosteroids and inferior to combination therapy with corticosteroids (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.86, 1 study, 110 patients). Forty-three per cent (55/128) of sulfasalazine patients entered remission at 17 to 18 weeks compared to 60% (79/132) of corticosteroid patients (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.91; 2 studies, 260 patients). A GRADE analysis rated the overall quality of the evidence supporting this outcome as moderate due to sparse data (134 events). Sulfasalazine patients experienced significantly fewer adverse events than corticosteroid patients (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.82; 1 study, 159 patients). There was no difference between sulfasalazine and corticosteroids in serious adverse events or withdrawal due to adverse events. Olsalazine was less effective than placebo in a single trial (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.71; 91 patients). Low dose mesalamine (1 to 2 g/day) was not superior to placebo for induction of remission. Twenty-three per cent (43/185) of low dose mesalamine patients entered remission at week 6 compared to 15% (18/117) of placebo patients (RR = 1.46, 95% CI 0.89 to 2.40; n = 302). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence supporting this outcome was low due to risk of bias (incomplete outcome data) and sparse data (61 events). There was no difference between low dose mesalamine and placebo in the proportion of patients who had adverse events (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.96; 3 studies, 342 patients) or withdrew due to adverse events (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.95; 3 studies, 342 patients). High dose controlled-release mesalamine (4 g/day) was not superior to placebo, inducing a clinically non significant reduction in CDAI (MD -19.8 points, 95% CI -46.2 to 6.7; 3 studies, 615 patients), and was also inferior to budesonide (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.78; 1 study, 182 patients, GRADE = low). While high dose delayed-release mesalamine (3 to 4.5 g/day) was not superior to placebo for induction of remission (RR 2.02, 95% CI 0.75 to 5.45; 1 study, 38 patients, GRADE = very low), no significant difference in efficacy was found when compared to conventional corticosteroids (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.36; 3 studies, 178 patients, GRADE = moderate) or budesonide (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.05; 1 study, 307 patients, GRADE = moderate). However, these trials were limited by risk of bias (incomplete outcome data) and sparse data (small numbers of events). There was a lack of good quality clinical trials comparing sulfasalazine with other mesalamine formulations. Adverse events that were commonly reported included headache, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhea.

Authors' Conclusions

Sulfasalazine is only modestly effective with a trend towards benefit over placebo and is inferior to corticosteroids for the treatment of mildly to moderately active Crohn's disease. Olsalazine and low dose mesalamine (1 to 2 g/day) are not superior to placebo. High dose mesalamine (3.2 to 4 g/day) is not more effective than placebo for inducing response or remission. However, trials assessing the efficacy of high dose mesalamine (4 to 4.5 g/day) compared to budesonide yielded conflicting results and firm conclusions cannot be made. Future large randomized controlled trials are needed to provide definitive evidence on the efficacy of aminosalicylates in active Crohn's disease.

### Long-term outcome of Crohn's disease following corticosteroid-induced remission [^ac4b681e]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

Corticosteroids are the gold standard in the treatment of moderate to severe Crohn's disease but are often associated with severe and potentially dangerous side effects. Despite an initial clinical response many patients become steroid dependent or require further steroid courses in the long term. The aim of the present study was to assess the probability of the need for further steroid treatment in Crohn's disease patients following steroid-induced remission and to establish if clinical variables can predict further steroid needs. PATIENTS AND All

Methods

patients at their first steroid course and with corticosteroid-induced remission, defined as a Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) <150, 4 wk after steroid weaning, were studied and observed at follow-up for 12 months. The main outcome was clinical relapse requiring further steroid treatment. Statistical analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method and multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression model taking into consideration gender, age at diagnosis, disease location and behavior, smoking habits, CDAI score before steroid treatment, and C reactive protein values at steroid weaning, as covariates.

Results

A total of 77 patients with steroid-induced remission were included. One-year follow-up was available in 75 of the 77 patients (97.4%). During follow-up 49 of 75 patients (65.3%) maintained remission or presented mild relapse not requiring steroids while 26 of 75 patients (34.6%) had moderate to severe relapse requiring further steroid treatment. The cumulative probability of a course free from steroids was 93.3%, 82.6%, 78.6%, and 66.6% at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, respectively. At multivariate analysis, increased C reactive protein at steroid weaning and penetrating complications were independent risk factors for further steroid requirement (OR 5.57, 95% CI 1.20-25.91, P= 0.001 and OR 4.20, 95% CI 1.76-10.04, P= 0.005, respectively).

Conclusion

Despite an initial clinical response and successful steroid tapering, 35% of patients required further steroid treatment within 1 yr. An increased C reactive protein value, at steroid weaning, despite clinical remission, and penetrating complications may predict further steroid requirement in already steroid responsive patients.

### The long-term effect on surgery-free survival of biological compared to conventional therapy in Crohn's disease in real world-data: a retrospective study [^0396f0e8]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Crohn’s Disease (CD) is an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) characterized by a chronic disorder with periods of relapse and remission and a progressive course that leads to bowel damage and disability. All segments of the gastrointestinal tract can be affected, although the terminal ileum is most frequently involved.

The current management of CD is focused on a treat-to-target strategy, aimed to induce a deep remission, with adjustment of appropriate medications.

Normalization of serum and faecal markers (especially C-reactive protein and calprotectin, respectively) and achieving a condition of clinical remission are considered immediate goals that must be achieved with dose adjustment or escalation therapy. Transmural healing is a desirable target as surrogate marker of depth remission. However, currently, there is no strong evidence concerning this valuable objective in the long term.

Thus, in this holistic strategy, integration between conventional therapy, biological therapy, nutritional/supplementation intervention and surgery is the therapeutic tool that must be carefully selected on a case-by-case basis [,–].

The introduction of biological drugs has led to great expectations and growing optimism in the possibility that this new therapeutic strategy could favourably change the natural history of IBD and in particular, that it could lead to a significant reduction in surgery in the short and long term.

Recently, conventional therapy has become increasingly unattractive due to its lower effectiveness in inducing and maintaining remission in the short-term period, compared to biological therapy. Moreover, meta-analyses found no evidence of the effectiveness of mesalamine (5-ASA) for the maintenance of medically induced remission in patients with CD. While 5-ASA preparations may be superior to placebo for the maintenance of surgically-induced remission in patients with CD.

AGA guideline—Immunomodulator withdrawal in Crohn’s disease on combination therapy: Meta-analysis data (404 individuals; 5 studies) found no significant difference in overall relapse risk with immunomodulator withdrawal versus continued combination therapy (16.8% vs 14.9%; RR, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.75–1.76). In the included RCTs (randomized controlled trials), 6 studies examining serious adverse events found no significant difference, with follow-up limited to 12–24 months. The certainty of evidence was judged to be low, and the panel suggested in favor of withdrawal of immunomodulators in patients in clinical remission on combination therapy. Clinical trial evidence suggests that clinical outcomes are similar when withdrawing immunomodulators in corticosteroid-free remission, though in 3 trials infliximab trough concentrations at the end of follow-up were lower and antibodies to infliximab were higher with immunomodulator withdrawal. Observational cohorts have demonstrated an increased risk of adverse events with combination therapy in relation to monotherapy, contextualizing potential benefits of withdrawal.

### Understanding patient journey in ulcerative colitis prior to biologic initiation: a 5-year exploration [^7376f033]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are the two major forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). CD is considered in most cases as a chronic, progressive, destructive disease. CD therapies were previously limited to conventional immunomodulators (e.g. thiopurines) until the late 1990s, when the introduction of anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) biologic agents created a paradigm shift in CD management, a shift toward earlier, more aggressive treatment with the aim of achieving “deep remission”, inducing “mucosal healing”, thus preventing or retarding progression to irreversible bowel damage.

UC is characterized by diffuse mucosal inflammation limited to the colon. UC treatment guidelines set a goal of induction and maintenance of remission of symptoms to provide an improved quality of life, reduction in need for long-term corticosteroids, and minimization of cancer risk (long-term mucosal healing may reduce the risk of dysplasia). Historically, 5-aminosalicylates (5-ASA) have been used as first-line therapy in patients with moderately to severely active UC with or without the addition of corticosteroids. For patients who have failed to respond to these oral medications and hospitalized for intensive treatment, colectomy may have to be considered if patients do not respond to intravenous corticosteroids by day 3, 7, or 21 of treatment (clinical decision weighing the benefits and risk in the context of “save the patient” or “save the colon”). More recently, however, for adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis in the outpatient setting, the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) suggests early use of biologic agents with or without immunomodulator therapy, rather than gradual step-up therapy after failure of 5-ASA. In hospitalized adult patients with acute severe UC, the AGA suggests using intravenous methylprednisolone dose equivalent of 40 to 60 mg/d. Despite the availability of potent biologic agents to induce and maintain remission for UC patients, and even as rescue therapy (i.e. last resort before colectomy), it has been claimed that surgery is still required for 20%-30% of patients with UC at some point during their lifetime. Population-based inception cohort studies have reported 5-year cumulative risk of UC disease progression of about 13%, and significantly higher risk of colectomy in patients with extensive colitis.

### Methotrexate for induction of remission in refractory Crohn's disease [^c6dff81a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Although corticosteroids are effective for induction of remission of Crohn's disease, many patients relapse when steroids are withdrawn or become steroid dependent. Furthermore, corticosteroids exhibit significant adverse effects. The success of methotrexate as a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis led to its evaluation in patients with refractory Crohn's disease. Methotrexate has been studied for induction of remission of refractory Crohn's disease and has become the principal alternative to azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine therapy. This systematic review is an update of a previously published Cochrane review.

Objectives

The primary objective was to assess the efficacy and safety of methotrexate for induction of remission in patients with active Crohn's disease in the presence or absence of concomitant steroid therapy.

Search Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL and the Cochrane IBD/FBD group specialized register from inception to June 27, 2012 for relevant studies. Conference proceedings and reference lists were also searched to identify additional studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials of methotrexate compared to placebo or an active comparator for treatment of active refractory Crohn's disease in adult patients (> 17 years) were considered for inclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

The primary outcome was failure to failure to enter remission and withdrawal from steroids. Secondary outcomes included adverse events, withdrawal due to adverse events, serious adverse events and quality of life. We calculated the relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for each outcome. Data were analyzed on an intention to treat basis. The Cochrane risk of bias tool was used to assess the methodological quality of included studies. The GRADE approach was used to assess the overall quality of evidence supporting the primary outcome.

Main Results

Seven studies (495 patients) were included. Four studies were rated as low risk of bias. Three studies were rated as high risk of bias due to open label or single-blind designs. The seven studies differed with respect to participants, intervention, and outcomes to the extent that it was considered to be inappropriate to pool the data for meta-analysis. Three small studies which employed low doses of oral methotrexate showed no statistically significant difference in failure to induce remission between methotrexate and placebo or between methotrexate and 6-mercaptopurine. For the study using 15 mg/week of oral methotrexate 33% (5/15) of methotrexate patients failed to enter remission compared to 11% (2/18) of placebo patients (RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.68 to 13.31). For the study using 12.5 mg/week of oral methotrexate 81% (21/26) of methotrexate patients failed to enter remission compared to 77% (20/26) of placebo patients (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.39). This study also had an active comparator arm, 81% (21/26) of methotrexate patients failed to enter remission compared to 59% (19/32) of 6-mercaptopurine patients (RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.92). For the active comparator study using 15 mg/week oral methotrexate, 20% (3/15) of methotrexate patients failed to enter remission compared to 6% of 6-mercaptopurine patients (RR 3.20, 95% CI 0.37 to 27.49). This study also had a 5-ASA arm and found that methotrexate patients were significantly more likely to enter remission than 5-ASA patients. Twenty per cent (3/15) of methotrexate patients failed to enter remission compared to 86% (6/7) of 5-ASA patients (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.67). One small study which used a higher dose of intravenous or oral methotrexate (25 mg/week) showed no statistically significant difference between methotrexate and azathioprine. Forty-four per cent (12/27) of methotrexate patients failed to enter remission compared to 37% of azathioprine patients (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.63 to 2.29). Two studies found no statistically significant difference in failure to enter remission between the combination of infliximab and methotrexate and infliximab monotherapy. One small study utilized intravenous methotrexate (20 mg/week) for 5 weeks and then switched to oral (20 mg/week). Forty-five per cent (5/11) of patients in the combination group failed to enter remission compared to 62% of infliximab patients (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.69) The other study assessing combination therapy utilized subcutaneous methotrexate (maximum dose 25 mg/week). Twenty-four per cent (15/63) of patients in the combination group failed to enter remission compared to 22% (14/63) of infliximab patients (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.57 to 2.03). A large placebo-controlled study which employed a high dose of methotrexate intramuscularly showed a statistically significant benefit relative to placebo. Sixty-one per cent of methotrexate patients failed to enter remission compared to 81% of placebo patients (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.93; number needed to treat, NNT=5). Withdrawals due to adverse events were significantly more common in methotrexate patients than placebo in this study. Seventeen per cent of methotrexate patients withdrew due to adverse events compared to 2% of placebo patients (RR 8.00, 95% CI 1.09 to 58.51). The incidence of adverse events was significantly more common in methotrexate patients (63%, 17/27) than azathioprine patients (26%, 7/27) in one small study (RR 2.42, 95% CI 1.21 to 4.89). No other statistically significant differences in adverse events, withdrawals due to adverse events or serious adverse events were reported in any of the other placebo-controlled or active comparator studies. Common adverse events included nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, skin rash and headache.

Authors' Conclusions

There is evidence from a single large randomized trial which suggests that intramuscular methotrexate (25 mg/week) provides a benefit for induction of remission and complete withdrawal from steroids in patients with refractory Crohn's disease. Lower dose oral methotrexate does not appear to provide any significant benefit relative to placebo or active comparator. However, these trials were small and further studies of oral methotrexate may be justified. Comparative studies of methotrexate to drugs such as azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine would require the randomization of large numbers of patients. The addition of methotrexate to infliximab therapy does not appear to provide any additional benefit over infiximab monotherapy. However these studies were relatively small and further research is needed to determine the role of methotrexate when used in conjunction with infliximab or other biological therapies.

Agents targeting IL-12/23 and IL-23—ustekinumab recommendation and dose optimization concept: We recommend ustekinumab in patients with moderate-to-severe CD for induction and maintenance of remission (strong recommendation, moderate level of evidence). Biologic therapy (including anti-IL-12/23 therapy, anti-TNF therapy, and anti-integrin therapy) dose optimization may be considered for patients with inadequate or loss of response to these specific biologic agents' induction and maintenance. Ustekinumab, an IgG1 anti-p40 antibody that inhibits IL-12 and IL-23, is effective for patients with CD with prior exposure to conventional therapies (e.g., corticosteroids, immunomodulators) and/or anti-TNF agents for induction and maintenance of remission (337).

### Biologic monotherapy versus combination therapy with immunomodulators in the induction and maintenance of remission of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis [^cebf0053]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which includes ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD), is a general term describing chronic inflammatory diseases that affect the gastrointestinal tract. The incidence of IBD has been on the rise worldwide. IBD is estimated to affect 1.6 million USA residents and up to 3.7 million European residents [-]. IBD affects patients of all age groups, but has 2 peaks: a main peak between ages 15 and 25 years and another peak in the fifth to seventh decade of life [-]. Patients with IBD tend to have a diminished quality of life, especially those with active disease. The ultimate goal of treatment is to induce disease remission and to maintain it.

To date, IBD has no cure and current treatments are associated with a number of side-effects. Available medications for the treatment of IBD include corticosteroids, 5-aminosalycilic acid (5-ASA) drugs, immunomodulators, biologic agents and small molecules. Corticosteroids are commonly used in symptomatic patients with moderate-to-severe UC and CD to induce remission. They are not generally used for the maintenance of remission, because of their side-effect profile and lack of effectiveness when used for prolonged periods of time. Immunomodulator drugs include methotrexate and the thiopurines, azathioprine, and 6-mercaptopurine. Thiopurines have a slow onset of action with clinical remission observed at 12-17 weeks, compared to 6-8 weeks for methotrexate, which explains the use of the latter as an induction agent in CD. They are steroid-sparing drugs and are commonly used to maintain remission after induction with corticosteroids.

### A 5-year prospective observational study of the outcomes of international treatment guidelines for Crohn's disease [^cc7b4564]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2009). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Therapeutic strategies for patients with Crohn's disease are based on American and European guidelines. High rates of corticosteroid dependency and low remission rates are identified as weaknesses of this therapy and as justification for early introduction of biologic agents (top-down treatment) in moderate/severe Crohn's disease. We reviewed outcomes and corticosteroid-dependency rates of patients with moderate-to-severe disease who were treated according to the international guidelines.

Methods

Consecutive patients (102) newly diagnosed with Crohn's disease in 2000-2002 were identified from a prospectively maintained database. Severity of disease was scored using the Harvey-Bradshaw Index (HBI). Disease was classified by Montreal classification. Five-year follow-up data were recorded.

Results

Seventy-two patients had moderate/severe disease at diagnosis (HBI >8). Fifty-four (75%) had nonstricturing, nonpenetrating disease (B1). Sixty-four (89%) received corticosteroids, and 44 (61%) received immunomodulators. Twenty-one patients (29%) received infliximab. Thirty-nine patients (54%) required resection surgery. At a median of 5 years, 66 of 72 (92%) patients with moderate/severe disease were in remission (median HBI, 1). Twenty-five patients (35%) required neither surgery nor biologic therapy.

Conclusions

When international treatment guidelines are strictly followed, Crohn's disease patients can achieve high rates of remission and low rates of morbidity at 5 years. Indiscriminate use of biologic agents therefore is not appropriate for all patients with moderate-to-severe disease.

### AGA living clinical practice guideline on the pharmacologic management of moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease [^e69aa9c9]. Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

AGA living guideline on pharmacologic management of Crohn’s disease—discussion of endoscopic targets and outcomes: Recent position statements advise that longitudinal targets for the management of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) should include not only clinical remission but also endoscopic resolution of inflammation, and studies have shown favorable long-term outcomes among patients who achieve endoscopic remission, including a post‑hoc analysis reporting fewer serious disease‑related complications with endoscopic remission (adjusted HR, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.07–0.31). In contrast, a TAILORIX long‑term follow‑up examined 95 individuals, 45 of whom had achieved deep remission, and in this small cohort there was no difference in rates of Crohn’s disease (CD)–related treatment modification, major abdominal or perianal surgery, or CD‑related hospitalization over follow‑up. There was significant heterogeneity among the 2 reviewed studies using endoscopic targets, and based on uncertainty the guideline panel could not make a recommendation in relation to selecting endoscopic targets over clinical targets. In both included trials, the majority of individuals in the endoscopic healing arms were not able to meet the goal of endoscopic healing; for example, only 11% of individuals achieved endoscopic remission. The current question does not address a tight control strategy focusing on treating to a target of biochemical remission, and the CALM trial demonstrated the benefit of a monitoring strategy incorporating biochemical monitoring over clinical monitoring alone.

### Real-world effectiveness of advanced therapies among patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis in the United States [^04d42b80]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an inflammatory disease of the colon characterized by intermittent periods of disease flaring and remission. It affects approximately 900,000 people in the United States.Although the primary clinical symptom is the presence of bloody diarrhea, patients can also experience a range of additional symptoms including urgency and abdominal pain. Individuals can also have more systemic symptoms, such as fever and weight loss.

The goal of treatment in UC is to induce and maintain remission of symptoms and allow for healing of inflammation.For patients with mild to moderate disease severity, conventional treatment typically consists of oral or topical aminosalicylates (5-ASAs) or topical steroids for induction of remission and oral and/or topical 5-ASAs for maintenance. For patients who are refractory to 5-ASA therapy or topical steroids, oral steroids can be used to induce remission. However, steroids are not indicated for maintenance therapy in UC. Despite this, 22% of patients develop steroid dependency, and only half achieve steroid-free remission within a year of their first course of systemic steroids.Inability to taper off steroids is suggestive of a need to switch to advanced therapies.

Approximately half of newly diagnosed patients progress to moderate or severe disease, either continuously or intermittently.In addition, many patients with UC do not respond to conventional therapies, either failing to respond to induction therapy (primary nonresponse) or initially achieving remission but not maintaining it with long-term treatment (secondary nonresponse). For example, 42% of patients fail to achieve clinical improvement with oral 5-ASA induction treatment,and a further subset fail to maintain remission at ≥6 months.For patients with moderate to severe disease, advanced therapies available at the time of this study (March 31, 2017) included immunosuppressants (eg, azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine) and biologic therapies (adalimumab, infliximab, golimumab, and vedolizumab),, although clinical practice guidelines have recently been updated to include tofacitinib, an oral small molecule Janus kinase inhibitor for the treatment of UC.In patients with primary nonresponse to one of the tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi) biologic therapies, an alternative mechanism of disease control (eg, a different class of therapy) is recommended over switching to a different TNFi.

It is a challenge to monitor patients with Crohn's disease who remain symptomatic despite anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy. Clinicians must use a systematic approach for each patient and obtain objective evidence about disease activity and response to therapy. Alternate etiologies for symptoms should be sought and treated, if found. Active Crohn's disease despite therapy requires reassessment and adjustments to management plans.

### Budesonide for induction of remission in Crohn's disease [^e61561ed]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Corticosteroids are commonly used for the induction of remission in Crohn's disease. However, traditional corticosteroids can cause significant adverse events. Budesonide is an alternative glucocorticoid with limited systemic bioavailability.

Objectives

The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral budesonide for the induction of remission in Crohn's disease.

Search Methods

The following electronic databases were searched up to June 2014: MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, the Cochrane IBD/FBD Group Specialised Trial Register, and ClinicalTrials.gov. Reference lists of articles, as well as conference proceedings were manually searched.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing budesonide to a placebo or active comparator were considered for inclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two independent investigators reviewed studies for eligibility, extracted the data and assessed study quality. Methodological quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool The overall quality of the evidence supporting the outcomes was evaluated using the GRADE criteria. Meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.3.5 software. The primary outcome was induction of remission (defined by a Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) < 150) by week 8 to 16 of treatment. Secondary outcomes included: time to remission, mean change in CDAI, clinical, histological or endoscopic improvement, improvement in quality of life, adverse events and early withdrawal. We calculated the relative risk (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each dichotomous outcome and the mean difference and corresponding 95% CI for each continuous outcome. Data were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis. A random-effects model was used for the pooled analyses. The overall quality of the evidence supporting the primary outcomes and selected secondary outcomes was evaluated using the GRADE criteria.

Main Results

Fourteen studies (1805 patients) were included: Nine (779 patients) compared budesonide to conventional corticosteroids, three (535 patients) were placebo-controlled, and two (491 patients) compared budesonide to mesalamine. Ten studies were judged to be at low risk of bias. Three studies were judged to be at high risk of bias due to open label design. One study was judged to be at high risk of bias due to selective reporting. After eight weeks of treatment, 9 mg budesonide was significantly more effective than placebo for induction of clinical remission. Forty-seven per cent (115/246) of budesonide patients achieved remission at 8 weeks compared to 22% (29/133) of placebo patients (RR 1.93, 95% CI 1.37 to 2.73; 3 studies, 379 patients). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence for this outcome was moderate due to sparse data (144 events). Budesonide was significantly less effective than conventional steroids for induction of remission at eight weeks. Fifty-two per cent of budesonide patients achieved remission at week 8 compared to 61% of patients who received conventional steroids (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.97; 8 studies, 750 patients). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence for this outcome was moderate due to risk of bias. Budesonide was significantly less effective than conventional steroids among patients with severe disease (CDAI > 300) (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.95). Studies comparing budesonide to mesalamine were not pooled due to heterogeneity (I(2) = 81%). One study (n = 182) found budesonide to be superior to mesalamine for induction of remission at 8 weeks. Sixty-eight per cent (63/93) of budesonide patients were in remission at 8 weeks compared to 42% (37/89) of mesalamine patients (RR 1.63, 95% CI 1.23 to 2.16). The other study found no statistically significant difference in remission rates at eight weeks. Sixty-nine per cent (107/154) of budesonide patients were in remission at 8 weeks compared to 62% (132/242) of mesalamine patients (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.32). Fewer adverse events occurred in those treated with budesonide compared to conventional steroids (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.76) and budesonide was better than conventional steroids in preserving adrenal function (RR for abnormal ACTH test 0.65, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.78).

Authors' Conclusions

Budesonide is more effective than placebo for induction of remission in Crohn's disease. Although short-term efficacy with budesonide is less than with conventional steroids, particularly in those with severe disease or more extensive colonic involvement, the likelihood of adverse events and adrenal suppression with budesonide is lower. The current evidence does not allow for a firm conclusion on the relative efficacy of budesonide compared to 5-ASA products.

### Infliximab in Crohn's disease: early and long-term treatment [^7035e998]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2008). Low credibility.

The natural history of Crohn's disease is characterized by a remitting and relapsing course that progresses to complications and surgery in the majority of patients. Current treatment guidelines advocate a stepwise approach according to disease location and severity at presentation, with goals mainly aimed at inducing and maintaining clinical remission. Major advances in the understanding of the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease offered significant opportunities for the development of new therapies over the past years. Infliximab and other biologic agents have shown impressive results in Crohn's disease patients refractory to standard therapy, suggesting a potential disease course-modifying action. These led to the proposal to reverse the traditional therapeutic algorithms using these agents early in the course of the disease. Preliminary data suggest that early intervention may be a more effective treatment strategy in some Crohn's disease patients. As yet, early and indiscriminate use of biologics remains to be supported by convincing evidence. Data on long-term treatment of Crohn's disease with infliximab or other biologics are even more scarce. Future studies aimed to identify predictors of complicated disease and long-term randomized studies aimed to compare "step-up" and "top-down" strategies in high-risk groups should help to answer if early introduction of biological therapy alters the natural history of Crohn's disease.

### Effect of concomitant therapy with steroids and tumor necrosis factor antagonists for induction of remission in patients with Crohn's disease: a systematic review and pooled meta-analysis [^744915cb]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

It is not clear whether concomitant therapy with corticosteroids and anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents is more effective at inducing remission in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) than anti-TNF monotherapy. We aimed to determine whether patients with active CD receiving corticosteroids during induction therapy with anti-TNF agents had higher rates of clinical improvement than patients not receiving corticosteroids during induction therapy.

Methods

We systematically searched the MEDLINE, Embase, and CENTRAL databases, through January 20, 2016, for randomized trials of anti-TNF agents approved for treatment of CD and identified 14 trials (5 of adalimumab, 5 of certolizumab, and 4 of infliximab). We conducted a pooled meta-analysis of individual patient and aggregated data from these trials. We compared data from participants who continued oral corticosteroids during induction with anti-TNF therapy to those treated with anti-TNF agents alone. The endpoints were clinical remission (CD activity index [CDAI] scores <150) and clinical response (a decrease in CDAI of 100 points) at the end of induction (weeks 4-14 of treatment).

Results

We included 4354 patients who received induction therapy with anti-TNF agents, including 1653 [38.0%] who were receiving corticosteroids. The combination of corticosteroids and an anti-TNF agent induced clinical remission in 32.0% of patients, whereas anti-TNF monotherapy induced clinical remission in 35.5% of patients (odds ratio [OR], 0.93; 95% CI, 0.74-1.17). The combination of corticosteroids and an anti-TNF agent induced a clinical response in 42.7% of patients, whereas anti-TNF monotherapy induced a clinical response in 46.8% (OR 0.84; 95% CI, 0.73-0.96). These findings did not change with adjustment for baseline CDAI scores and concurrent use of immunomodulators.

Conclusions

Based on a meta-analysis of data from randomized trials of anti-TNF therapies in patients with active CD, patients receiving corticosteroids during induction therapy with anti-TNF agents did not have higher rates of clinical improvement compared with patients not receiving corticosteroids during induction therapy. Given these findings and the risks of corticosteroid use, clinicians should consider early weaning of corticosteroids during induction therapy with anti-TNF agents for patients with corticosteroid-refractory CD.

Implementation considerations after exposure to advanced therapies—Second-line TNF antagonists (specifically infliximab or adalimumab) may be effective after discontinuation of a first TNF antagonist due to immunogenicity or intolerance, but may not be effective after primary nonresponse, in which case alternative mechanisms of action should be considered; individual patient factors and preferences should be incorporated within a shared decision framework; some patients with multiple prior biologic failures may require longer induction or higher maintenance dosing; Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors may be associated with higher risk of major adverse cardiovascular events and cancer than TNF antagonists in older adults with cardiovascular risk factors including high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level of <40 mg/dL; and there are limited data on the safety of JAK inhibitors in pregnancy, so they should be avoided in women of childbearing age contemplating pregnancy in the near future.

European Crohn’s and Colitis Organisation (ECCO) guidance for moderate-to-severely active Crohn’s disease—updated in October 2024—outlined therapy choices, combinations, and de-escalation: they “recommended against thiopurines for induction therapy” and “recommended parenteral methotrexate for both induction and maintenance,” with biologic positions similar to other societies. They “recommended combination therapy for infliximab with a thiopurine, and consideration of thiopurine withdrawal after 6–12 months in those who achieve long-term remission,” but “did not recommend combination therapy with adalimumab, and instead recommended adalimumab monotherapy.” They “commented specifically on adalimumab and ustekinumab being equally effective in those who are biologic therapy-naive,” “recommended upadacitinib use regardless of prior advanced therapy exposure,” and “made no recommendation related to mirikizumab.” In contrast to AGA, they stated “there is insufficient evidence to guide positioning therapies,” and they “recommended upfront use of advanced therapy and treat-to-target monitoring.”

### Biologics, small molecule therapies and surgery in small bowel Crohn's disease [^9a28d9e5]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The terminal ileum and small bowel (SB) are involved in 30-45% of patients with Crohn's disease, while 20% have both small and large bowel involvement. Ileal Crohn's is associated with higher risk of progression to stricturing and penetrating disease 1 , hence it's imperative to utilize effective therapies to induce and maintain clinical and endoscopic remission and prevent intestinal complications. We review the available data of biologics and upadacitinib in small bowel disease, and the emerging data on the role of surgery as first line therapy for isolated Crohn's ileitis.

Recent Findings

Most trials assessing drug efficacy do not report efficacy by disease location, and robust data on efficacy of therapies in isolated small bowel Crohn's is sparse. Several studies indicate that small bowel disease is generally less responsive to biologics, and could require higher drug trough levels to achieve endoscopic healing.

Summary

Current therapies for induction and maintenance of remission in moderate to severe Crohn's disease include several classes of monoclonal antibodies and a Janus Kinase inhibitor, upadacitinib. While small bowel Crohn's disease is generally less responsive to treatment, anti-TNFs are still preferred as first line therapy, and the option of early ileocecal resection in early limited ileal disease is gaining interest.

### Adalimumab for induction of remission in Crohn's disease [^ff516c53]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Adalimumab is an IgG1 monoclonal antibody that targets and blocks tumor necrosis factor-alpha, a pro-inflammatory cytokine involved in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD). A significant proportion of people with CD fail conventional therapy or therapy with biologics or develop significant adverse events. Adalimumab may be an effective alternative for these individuals.

Objectives

The objectives of this review were to assess the efficacy and safety of adalimumab for the induction of remission in CD.

Search Methods

We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, the Cochrane IBD Group Specialized Register, ClinicalTrials.Gov and the World Health Organization trial registry (ICTRP) from inception to 16 April 2019. References and conference abstracts were searched to identify additional studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any dose of adalimumab to placebo or an active comparator in participants with active CD were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently screened studies, extracted data and assessed bias using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. The primary outcome was the failure to achieve clinical remission, as defined by the original studies. Clinical remission was defined as a Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) score of less than 150 points. Secondary outcomes included failure to achieve clinical response (defined as a decrease in CDAI of > 100 points or > 70 points from baseline), failure to achieve endoscopic remission and response, failure to achieve histological remission and response, failure to achieve steroid withdrawal, adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs), withdrawal from study due to AEs and quality of life measured by a validated instrument. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for dichotomous outcomes. Data were pooled for analysis if the participants, interventions, outcomes and time frame were similar. Data were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis. The overall certainty of the evidence was assessed using GRADE.

Main Results

Three placebo-controlled RCTs (714 adult participants) were included. The participants had moderate to severely active CD (CDAI 220 to 450). Two studies were rated as at low risk of bias and one study was rated as at unclear risk of bias. Seventy-six per cent (342/451) of adalimumab participants failed to achieve clinical remission at four weeks compared to 91% (240/263) of placebo participants (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.90; high-certainty evidence). Forty-four per cent (197/451) of adalimumab participants compared to 66% (173/263) of placebo participants failed to achieve a 70-point clinical response at four weeks (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.79; high-certainty evidence). At four weeks, 57% (257/451) of adalimumab participants failed to achieve a 100-point clinical response compared to 76% (199/263) of placebo participants (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.86; high-certainty evidence). Sixty-two per cent (165/268) of adalimumab participants experienced an AE compared to 72% (188/263) of participants in the placebo group (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.09; moderate-certainty evidence). Two percent (6/268) of adalimumab participants experienced a SAE compared to 5% (13/263) of participants in the placebo group (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.17 to 1.15; low-certainty evidence). Lastly, 1% (3/268) of adalimumab participants withdrew due to AEs compared to 3% (8/268) of participants in the placebo group (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.11 to 1.30; low-certainty evidence). Commonly reported adverse events included injection site reactions, abdominal pain, fatigue, worsening CD and nausea. Quality of life data did not allow for meta-analysis. Three studies reported better quality of life at four weeks with adalimumab (measured with either Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire or Short-Form 36; moderate-certainty evidence). Endoscopic remission and response, histologic remission and response, and steroid withdrawal were not reported in the included studies.

Authors' Conclusions

High-certainty evidence suggests that adalimumab is superior to placebo for induction of clinical remission and clinical response in people with moderate to severely active CD. Although the rates of AEs, SAEs and withdrawals due to AEs were lower in adalimumab participants compared to placebo, we are uncertain about the effect of adalimumab on AEs due to the low number of events. Therefore, no firm conclusions can be drawn regarding the safety of adalimumab in CD. Futher studies are required to look at the long-term effectiveness and safety of using adalimumab in participants with CD.

### Efficacy and safety of adalimumab in Chinese patients with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease: results from a randomized trial [^fa1b0206]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The incidence rates of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn’s disease (CD), have recently increased in geographic regions with traditionally low prevalence, such as Asia. Risk factors in developing nations include environmental exposures in childhood, immunologic factors, hygiene, and diet. – However, there is evidence that a number of risk factors differ between Western and Asian patients with CD. Studies characterizing Asian patients with IBD have found that susceptibility genes differ from those of Western populations. – Although clinical phenotypes are similar in Asian and Western populations, some studies report differences in disease location and surgical rates.

The increased incidence of CD in Asia was initially theorized to result from better disease awareness and diagnosis.However, improved diagnostic techniques and facilities were available before the increase in incidence and have not changed.Increased disease awareness is insufficient to account for the incidence increase observed in recent decades. Increased incidence is most likely attributable to environmental and lifestyle factors tied to socioeconomic changes and rapid industrialization. –

The standard of care for moderate to severe CD in China has been corticosteroids and immunosuppressants.However, these treatments are often not sufficient and can have serious adverse effects, especially if used long term. – Corticosteroids are effective in inducing remission, although prolonged exposure can lead to steroid dependence, steroid resistance, or surgery. Adverse effects are common, ; long-term prednisone therapy is linked with infection and death in patients with CD.Although treatment guidelines recommend immunomodulators as maintenance therapies,clinical evidence shows that immunomodulators are associated with suboptimal efficacy. A recent case-control study of a French registry suggested that the benefits of azathioprine therapy may be offset by the increased risk of treatment-related malignancy.

An approved treatment for Chinese patients with CD that is refractory to corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, or both is infliximab, an anti–tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antibody. However, some patients do not respond to treatment, experience loss of response, or become intolerant to the infusions,, suggesting the need to explore alternative options. Adalimumab, a fully human anti-TNF monoclonal antibody, has been shown to induce and maintain remission in global clinical trials of patients with CD, – including a Japanese program,but has not been studied in a Chinese CD population in a registration program. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of adalimumab in induction and maintenance treatment in adult Chinese patients with moderately to severely active CD.
