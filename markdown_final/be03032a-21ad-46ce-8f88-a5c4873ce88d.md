## Question

7.	6 year old child presented with spastic cerebral palsy. Which of the following history most likely suggest for perinatal asphyxia
a.	leucomalacia calcification on the brain
b.	recurrent seizure in child hood
c.	microcephaly
d.	perinatal respiratory distress

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which history element most strongly suggests perinatal asphyxia in a 6-year-old with spastic cerebral palsy, choosing among leucomalacia calcification, recurrent childhood seizures, microcephaly, and perinatal respiratory distress. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical construct of perinatal asphyxia and its neonatal correlates. Then, I should verify which option maps most directly to a hypoxic-ischemic insult around the time of birth. Next, I will examine each alternative against pathophysiology and epidemiology to check for stronger or weaker associations. Finally, I will reconcile any apparent contradictions and confirm the best-supported answer with guideline-aligned criteria and imaging patterns.

> Let me first confirm the clinical construct. Perinatal asphyxia reflects impaired gas exchange leading to hypoxemia and metabolic acidosis; clinically it often presents with low Apgar scores, need for resuscitation, and early encephalopathy, and it is a recognized but minority contributor to cerebral palsy overall, with estimates commonly cited around 10–20% in contemporary cohorts, so I need to be cautious not to over-attribute causality without supportive neonatal evidence [^115gmxTH].

> Now, I will examine Option D, perinatal respiratory distress, because it most directly signals impaired oxygenation and ventilation at birth. Wait, let me verify the neonatal correlates: severe asphyxia is associated with low Apgar scores, prolonged resuscitation, and metabolic acidosis, and respiratory compromise is a core manifestation of that physiology; in term infants, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy often follows such events, and cohorts of cooled infants frequently include those with perinatal respiratory depression or asphyxia, reinforcing the link to intrapartum hypoxia-ischemia rather than remote antenatal causes [^117EA2aT].

> Next, I should review Option A, leucomalacia calcification. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: periventricular leukomalacia is classically a white matter injury of prematurity and is strongly tied to spastic diplegia, whereas calcification is not a typical feature of acute hypoxic-ischemic injury in term infants; moreover, PVL can arise from antenatal processes and is not specific to intrapartum asphyxia, so this would be a weaker historical clue for perinatal asphyxia than a neonatal respiratory event [^115PVSWw] [^112rTY4Z] [^114peWDv].

> I will now examine Option B, recurrent childhood seizures. Hmm, wait a minute, seizures are common comorbidities in cerebral palsy and can follow neonatal encephalopathy, but they are nonspecific and can reflect diverse etiologies including stroke, infection, malformations, or genetic disorders; thus, seizures alone do not localize the timing or mechanism to perinatal asphyxia as reliably as a neonatal respiratory event does [^115PVSWw] [^114NYgar] [^117QmUEo].

> Let me consider Option C, microcephaly. I should double-check: microcephaly often reflects a prenatal process such as genetic or developmental brain disorders, congenital infections, or early gestational injury, and while it can accompany severe perinatal hypoxic-ischemic injury, it is not a sensitive or specific marker for intrapartum asphyxia compared with acute neonatal respiratory compromise; therefore, it is less likely to be the strongest historical indicator here [^111ckpvi] [^115PVSWw] [^113aYDj9].

> But wait, what if the question is trying to trick me into picking seizures because they are tightly linked to neonatal encephalopathy severity and later disability? Hold on, I should verify: while neonatal seizures correlate with worse outcomes after HIE, the stem asks for the history most suggestive of perinatal asphyxia, and the most direct neonatal correlate remains respiratory distress or the need for resuscitation rather than later seizure history, which is downstream and etiologically nonspecific [^113WeUuN] [^112bXPxo].

> I need to ensure my choice aligns with imaging-pathophysiology expectations. In term infants, acute profound HIE often shows basal ganglia and thalamic injury, whereas prolonged partial insults show watershed or parasagittal cortical-subcortical injury; neither classic pattern is captured by "leucomalacia calcification", which again points away from that option as a marker of intrapartum asphyxia in this context [^114peWDv] [^113fXPDF].

> Putting this together, perinatal respiratory distress is the most direct historical signal of impaired oxygenation and ventilation at birth, aligning with the pathophysiology of intrapartum hypoxia-ischemia and the neonatal criteria used to infer asphyxia, whereas the other options either reflect different timing or etiologies or are too nonspecific to anchor causation to perinatal asphyxia [^112bXPxo].

> Final answer: D. Perinatal respiratory distress [^112bXPxo].

---

The best answer is **perinatal respiratory distress** because it is a direct clinical manifestation of perinatal asphyxia and is strongly associated with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, a leading cause of spastic cerebral palsy [^116e9sx4] [^112bXPxo] [^114Z5JmX]. Leucomalacia calcification is a **radiological finding**, not a historical event; recurrent seizures are nonspecific and can occur in many CP etiologies; and microcephaly is a nonspecific developmental outcome rather than a specific indicator of asphyxia [^113aYDj9] [^117QmUEo].

---

## Analysis of options

### A. Leucomalacia calcification on the brain

Leucomalacia calcification is a **radiological finding** indicating chronic periventricular white matter injury, often associated with perinatal hypoxic-ischemic injury. However, it is not a historical event and cannot be elicited from the history alone. While it supports the diagnosis of perinatal asphyxia, it is not the most direct historical indicator.

---

### B. Recurrent seizures in childhood

Recurrent seizures are common in cerebral palsy but are **nonspecific** and can occur in various etiologies, including genetic, metabolic, infectious, and traumatic causes. Seizures alone do not specifically indicate perinatal asphyxia and are therefore not the most reliable historical indicator.

---

### C. Microcephaly

Microcephaly is a **nonspecific developmental outcome** that can result from various prenatal and perinatal insults, including genetic abnormalities, infections, and hypoxic-ischemic injury. It is not specific to perinatal asphyxia and cannot reliably indicate it as the cause of cerebral palsy.

---

### D. Perinatal respiratory distress

Perinatal respiratory distress is a **direct clinical manifestation** of perinatal asphyxia, reflecting inadequate oxygenation and ventilation at birth. It is strongly associated with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, a leading cause of spastic cerebral palsy. Historical documentation of respiratory distress, including the need for resuscitation, low Apgar scores, and prolonged oxygen therapy, is highly suggestive of perinatal asphyxia.

---

## Clinical evidence supporting perinatal respiratory distress as the most likely indicator

- **Incidence**: Perinatal asphyxia occurs in approximately 1.07% of live births globally, with significant regional variation [^1168W87K].
- **Association with cerebral palsy**: Perinatal asphyxia is a well-established risk factor for cerebral palsy, particularly spastic quadriplegia and dyskinetic forms [^113SHCes] [^112PHJ5u].
- **Clinical criteria**: The diagnosis of perinatal asphyxia is supported by clinical criteria such as low Apgar scores, need for resuscitation, metabolic acidosis, and early neonatal encephalopathy [^113SHCes] [^112bXPxo].
- **Neuroimaging correlation**: MRI findings of periventricular leukomalacia, basal ganglia injury, and watershed infarcts are commonly associated with perinatal asphyxia and subsequent cerebral palsy [^115uJj3X] [^114peWDv].

---

## Conclusion

Perinatal respiratory distress is the **most likely historical indicator** of perinatal asphyxia in a 6-year-old child with spastic cerebral palsy. It is a direct clinical manifestation of inadequate oxygenation and ventilation at birth, strongly associated with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, and supported by clinical criteria and neuroimaging findings. Leucomalacia calcification, recurrent seizures, and microcephaly are nonspecific and cannot reliably indicate perinatal asphyxia as the cause of cerebral palsy.

### Cerebral palsy: not always what it seems [^115Aneb2]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2019). Medium credibility.

Cerebral palsy (CP) is not a disease, but a neurological syndrome, a combination of signs and symptoms, some of which may occur in neurodegenerative or metabolic disorders, particularly those with an onset in the first 2years of life. There are many different causes of the syndrome. All children with CP should undergo brain MRI, even with an identified antenatal or perinatal insult. Children with CP should be referred to a paediatric neurologist or a clinical geneticist, or both, if appropriate and particularly in the absence of a known perinatal cerebral insult, with brain MRI that is reported to be normal, a progression in, or new, signs or where there is a reported 'family history of CP'. Finally, a few of the CP syndromes may be readily treatable and potentially prevent irreversible neurological and cognitive impairment.

### De novo point mutations in patients diagnosed with ataxic cerebral palsy [^117XfRF1]. Brain (2015). Low credibility.

Cerebral palsy is commonly attributed to perinatal asphyxia. However, Schnekenberg et al. describe here four individuals with ataxic cerebral palsy likely due to de novo dominant mutations associated with increased paternal age. Therefore, patients with cerebral palsy should be investigated for genetic causes before the disorder is ascribed to asphyxia.

### Children born at 32 to 35 weeks with birth asphyxia and later cerebral palsy are different from those born after 35 weeks [^114e96cx]. Journal of Perinatology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

The objectives of this study were to (1) establish the proportion of cerebral palsy (CP) that occurs with a history suggestive of birth asphyxia in children born at 32 to 35 weeks and (2) evaluate their characteristics in comparison with children with CP born at ⩾36 weeks with such a history.

Study Design

Using the Canadian CP Registry, children born at 32 to 35 weeks of gestation with CP with a history suggestive of birth asphyxia were compared with corresponding ⩾36 weeks of gestation children.

Results

Of the 163 children with CP born at 32 to 35 weeks and 738 born at ⩾36 weeks, 26 (16%) and 105 (14%) had a history suggestive of birth asphyxia, respectively. The children born at 32 to 35 weeks had more frequent abruptio placenta (35% vs 12%; odds ratio (OR) 4.1, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.5 to 11.2), less frequent neonatal seizures (35% vs 72%; OR 0.20, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.52), more frequent white matter injury (47% vs 17%; OR 4.3, 95% CI 1.3 to 14.0), more frequent intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) (40% vs 6%; OR 11.2, 95% CI 3.4 to 37.4) and more frequent spastic diplegia (24% vs 8%; OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.2 to 12.2) than the corresponding ⩾36 weeks of gestation children.

Conclusions

Approximately 1 in 7 children with CP born at 32 to 35 weeks had a history suggestive of birth asphyxia. They had different magnetic resonance imaging patterns of injury from those born at ⩾36 weeks and a higher frequency of IVH. Importantly, when considering hypothermia in preterm neonates with suspected birth asphyxia, prospective surveillance for IVH will be essential.

### Cerebral palsy in children: a clinical practice review [^115PVSWw]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Cerebral palsy is a disorder characterized by abnormal tone, posture, and movement. In clinical practice, it is often useful to approach cerebral palsy based on the predominant motor system findings - spastic hemiplegia, spastic diplegia, spastic quadriplegia, extrapyramidal or dyskinetic, and ataxic. The prevalence of cerebral palsy is between 1.5 and 3 per 1,000 live births with higher percentage of cases in low to middle income countries and geographic regions. Pre-term birth and low birthweight are recognized as the most frequent risk factors for cerebral palsy; other risk factors include hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, maternal infections, and multiple gestation. In most cases of cerebral palsy, the initial injury to the brain occurs during early fetal brain development. Intracerebral hemorrhage and periventricular leukomalacia are the main pathologic findings found in preterm infants who develop spastic cerebral palsy. The diagnosis of cerebral palsy is primarily based on clinical findings. Early recognition of infants at risk for cerebral palsy as well as those with cerebral palsy is possible based on a combination of clinical history, use of standardized neuromotor assessment and findings on magnetic resonance imaging; however, in clinical practice, cerebral palsy is more reliably diagnosed by 2 years of age. Magnetic resonance imaging scan is indicated to delineate the extent of brain lesions and to identify congenital brain malformations. Genetic testing and tests for inborn errors of metabolism are indicated to identify specific disorders, especially treatable disorders. Because cerebral palsy is associated with multiple associated and secondary medical conditions, its management requires a sustained and consistent collaboration among multiple disciplines and specialties. With appropriate support, most children with cerebral palsy grow up to be adults with good functional abilities.

### The association of cerebral palsy with birth asphyxia: a definitional quagmire [^111xCAkg]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Aim

The aim of this study was to investigate whether current literature provides a useful body of evidence reflecting the proportion of cerebral palsy (CP) that is attributable to birth asphyxia.

Method

We identified 23 studies conducted between 1986 and 2010 that provided data on intrapartum risks of CP.

Results

The proportion of CP with birth asphyxia as a precursor (case exposure rate) varied from less than 3% to over 50% in the 23 studies reviewed. The studies were heterogeneous in many regards, including the definitions for birth asphyxia and the outcome of CP.

Interpretations

Current data do not support the belief, widely held in the medical and legal communities, that birth asphyxia can be recognized reliably and specifically, or that much of CP is due to birth asphyxia. The very high case exposure rates linking birth asphyxia to CP can probably be attributed to several factors: the fact that the clinical picture at birth cannot specifically identify birth asphyxia; the definition of CP employed; and confusion of proximal effects - results - with causes. Further research is needed.

### Genetic factors in athetoid cerebral palsy [^113aYDj9]. Journal of Child Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

Within the cerebral palsy syndromes, athetosis is most commonly causally associated with serious perinatal complications. Genetic factors are thought to play a lesser role, although the risk of recurrence in siblings has been suggested to be as high as 10%. We have conducted a clinical study of 22 subjects with a diagnosis of athetoid cerebral palsy and a review of the literature aiming to identify instances of familial recurrence of athetoid cerebral palsy. The birth history, family history, and previous investigations of subjects with athetoid cerebral palsy were studied and subjects were clinically examined for evidence of an underlying genetic etiology. Factors suggesting a genetic cause were specifically sought, such as advanced paternal age, progression of symptoms, and associated congenital abnormalities. No subjects in the study group had similarly affected relatives, and additional features suggesting a genetic cause were not observed. A literature search identified 16 instances of familial recurrence of athetoid cerebral palsy. Familial cases were typically associated with significant spasticity, microcephaly, intellectual disability, seizures, and a lack of history of birth asphyxia, and most could be explained by either autosomal-recessive or X-linked-recessive inheritance. The genetic contribution to athetoid cerebral palsy is small, with an overall risk of recurrence in siblings of about 1%. This risk is lower than previously suggested in the literature.

### Does perinatal asphyxia impair cognitive function without cerebral palsy? [^114NB5ps]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2006). Low credibility.

Some studies on neurodevelopmental outcomes after neonatal encephalopathy have suggested that cognitive deficits do not occur in the absence of cerebral palsy. It is increasingly apparent that childhood survivors of overt neonatal encephalopathy may have cognitive impairments, even in the absence of functional motor deficits. The risk of cognitive deficits is related to the severity of neonatal encephalopathy and the pattern of brain injury on neuroimaging, particularly the watershed pattern of injury. A better understanding of the risk factors for cognitive abnormalities after neonatal encephalopathy will ultimately lead to interventions to prevent these deficits. Identifying the full spectrum of neurodevelopmental outcomes after neonatal encephalopathy will also allow care givers to identify children requiring early intervention to maximise their potential for independent function throughout development.

### Cerebral palsy characteristics in term-born children with and without detectable perinatal risk factors: a cross-sectional study [^116GGzMY]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

What this paper adds
'Detectable' perinatal risk factors were absent in 25% of term‐born children in the Canadian Cerebral Palsy (CP) Registry.
Focal brain injury and hemiparesis were more common in children without detectable CP risk factors.
Those without detectable risk factors were more likely to be ambulatory and communicate with words.
Screening for early handedness may be most practical for early detection.

Cerebral palsy (CP) is a lifelong motor impairment caused by non‐progressive disturbance of early brain development, and is the most common physical disability of childhood.CP provides a label for the clinical manifestations of various brain conditions and can be categorized by phenotype as spastic (unilateral and bilateral), dyskinetic, hypotonic, and ataxic. The range of motor function can be described using scales such as the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) or Manual Ability Classification System. In addition to motor challenges, children with CP can have impairments in cognition, vision, hearing, and communication.

In high‐resource settings the estimated incidence of CP is 1.6 per 1000 births, which may be declining. Approximately 90% to 94% of CP is attributed to the antenatal and neonatal periods; and 6% to 10% to the postneonatal period. Historically, CP was particularly associated with preterm birth and hypoxic–ischemic encephalopathy, both of which are evident in neonates and often require care in a neonatal intensive care unit. Early diagnosis of CP is facilitated by follow‐up programs in neonatal intensive care units using tools such as the General Movements Assessment or specific magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) biomarkers. Early screening can reduce the time to diagnosis from 12 to 18 months of age to 6 months of age. After CP is diagnosed, infants can be engaged in targeted, evidence‐based therapies to improve their outcomes.

### Exome sequencing reveals genetic heterogeneity and clinically actionable findings in children with cerebral palsy [^1149Uauf]. Nature Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common motor disability in children. To ascertain the role of major genetic variants in the etiology of CP, we conducted exome sequencing on a large-scale cohort with clinical manifestations of CP. The study cohort comprised 505 girls and 1,073 boys. Utilizing the current gold standard in genetic diagnostics, 387 of these 1,578 children (24.5%) received genetic diagnoses. We identified 412 pathogenic and likely pathogenic (P/LP) variants across 219 genes associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, and 59P/LP copy number variants. The genetic diagnostic rate of children with CP labeled at birth with perinatal asphyxia was higher than the rate in children without asphyxia (P = 0.0033). Also, 33 children with CP manifestations (8.5%, 33 of 387) had findings that were clinically actionable. These results highlight the need for early genetic testing in children with CP, especially those with risk factors like perinatal asphyxia, to enable evidence-based medical decision-making.

### In-depth analysis reveals complex molecular aetiology in a cohort of idiopathic cerebral palsy [^113kVfa5]. Brain (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cerebral palsy (CP) is an umbrella term spanning a group of disorders with compromised ambulant performances, and is attributed to non-progressive disturbances in developing foetal and infant brains.CP can be categorized according to motor signs (spasticity, dyskinesia, ataxia and hypotonia, among which spasticity manifests in ∼80% of CP cases), involvement of extremities (hemiplegia, monoplegia, diplegia, triplegia and quadriplegia), and anatomical sites of brain lesions (cerebral cortex, pyramidal tract, extrapyramidal system and cerebellum). In CP children who are 2 years or older, severity is reliably classified via the five-level Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS). The common comorbidities of CP include intellectual disability (ID), epilepsy, vision and hearing problems, language deficits, autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), sleep disorders and secondary musculoskeletal defects such as scoliosis and hip dislocation. CP is the most prevalent physical disability of childhood, with a prevalence of 2.0–3.5 cases per 1000 live births in countries with varying degrees of socioeconomic development (> 20 million patients around the world), and the incidence of CP at term has remained consistent for over the past 50 years. CP poses a critical problem for rehabilitation and welfare systems, and the lifetime costs for a CP child in the United States are estimated to be $1 million. The conventional risk factors of CP consist of gestational and perinatal insults, including birth asphyxia, neonatal infections and teratogens. However, two thirds of CP patients are born at term, and birth asphyxia happens in < 10% of CP cases. Because the estimated upper limit of unconfirmed causality of CP comprises 80% of cases, it is reasonable that unknown mechanisms exist accounting for most CP events.

### Etiologic yield of cerebral palsy: a contemporary case series [^115aLtEA]. Pediatric Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

Cerebral palsy is an established symptom complex that results from heterogeneous etiologies. Our understanding of the relative contribution of underlying etiologies to the occurrence of cerebral palsy is largely derived from studies lacking systematic neurologic evaluation or the application of contemporary imaging modalities. Throughout a 10-year inclusive period, the case records of all consecutive patients diagnosed with cerebral palsy in a single pediatric neurology practice were reviewed with reference to clinical features and diagnostic yield. A total of 217 cases of cerebral palsy were identified (129 male, 88 female): 77 (35.5%) spastic quadriplegic, 68 (31.3%) spastic hemiplegic, 39 (18%) spastic diplegic, five (2.7%) spastic monoplegic, 12 (5.5%) mixed, 12 (5.5%) ataxic-hypotonic, two (0.9%) dyskinetic, two (0.9%) Worster-Drought syndrome. Overall etiologic yield was 82.0%, varying according to type of cerebral palsy: 50% dyskinetic, 59% diplegia, 80% monoplegia, 80.9% hemiplegia, 90.9% quadriplegia, 91.7% ataxic hypotonia, and 100% mixed/Woster-Drought. The top five etiologic entities identified were periventricular leukomalacia, 24.9%; intrapartum asphyxia, 21.7%; cerebral dysgenesis, 17.1%; intracranial hemorrhage, 12.9%; and vascular, 9.7%. Although a single etiology was apparent in 144 (66.4%) of the cases, multiple etiologies were believed to be contributory in 34 (15.6%) of the cases. The etiologic profile varied according to such features as the type of cerebral palsy, gestational age, and the source (high-risk neonatal population or not) of the patients. Features of the child's cerebral palsy, such as microcephaly, neonatal difficulties, prior or coexisting epilepsy, and high-risk source, were found to be predictive of eventual etiologic yield. This contemporary evaluation of cerebral palsy etiologic yield suggests that it is much higher than previously reported and varies, depending on key clinical features.

### Cerebral palsy-early diagnosis and intervention trial: protocol for the prospective multicentre CP-EDIT study with focus on diagnosis, prognostic factors, and intervention [^112Dagv3]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

More than 80% of children with CP have abnormal brain imaging. It has been recommended for many years to use MRI when diagnosing CP, even though CP remains a clinical diagnosis and MRI can be normal in a child with CP. A systematic review from 2007 showed that the majority of MRIs gave clues to the pathogenesis of CP. In a previous Australian study of children with CP, MRI patterns varied depending on parity, gestational age, level of neonatal care, Apgar score, and time to established respiration. Diagnostic MRI of newborns and infants with suspected CP is based on images with the focus on identifying structural brain pathology, such as periventricular leukomalacia, maldevelopment, or grey/white matter damage.

Genetics is known to play an important role in the development of CP. Previous research with genetic testing has shown that genetic aetiology, while often seen in children with no previous gestational or neonatal risk factor, is not limited to this group nor those with other neurodevelopmental comorbidities such as epilepsy or intellectual disability. One study has suggested an association between CP and genes that hinder early brain development and/or predispose to susceptibility to environmental risk factors. Causes for the various CP subtypes, including the most prevalent spastic subtype and the rare ataxic or dyskinetic subtypes, are different. In some cases, the cause is obvious, such as asphyxia during labour, cerebral bleeding, or infection. In many cases the exact cause is unknown. However, in an increasing number of patients it is now possible to identify the underlying cause, since it has become clear that CP can be part of several genetic syndromes. Many treatable metabolic and genetic diseases such as dopa-responsive dystonia may be misdiagnosed as CP. Identifying a genetic cause makes it possible to provide genetic counselling and maybe a specific treatment, e.g. with nutrient-specific diets or medications, which can interrupt disease progression and prevent further injury. In the current study extensive genetic testing with whole genome sequencing will be performed in participants with definite CP or high risk of CP.

### Clinically relevant copy number variations detected in cerebral palsy [^112FA8GS]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common cause of childhood physical disability, affecting ∼2.11 per 1,000 live births in high-resource settings. CP arises from a non-progressive pathology that affects the developing brain either pre-, peri- or postnatally. Some of the established risk factors for CP include prematurity, intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR), intra-uterine infections, birth defects and neonatal encephalopathy of various causes including perinatal asphyxia. Recent studies suggest that birth asphyxia explains < 10% of cases of neonatal encephalopathy. Furthermore, there is tremendous variability in outcomes for any given risk factor, suggesting that some children may have an inherent higher susceptibility to CP. The consensus definition of CPincludes associated co-morbidities, such as epilepsy, communication impairment, sensory impairments or cognitive deficits, which greatly contribute to the associated health burden for children and families.

CP can be classified by neurological subtype as well as by several functional classification systems. The neurological subtype stratification is based on the topographic distribution of affected limbs and the predominant quality of the observed motor impairment, grouping CP into subtypes: spastic quadriplegia, spastic diplegia, spastic hemiplegia, dyskinetic or dystonic, ataxic or hypotonic, or mixed. The motor severity can be described using the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS), which uses scores that range from most able (level I) to least able (level V).

Twin and family studies suggest a genetic contribution to some CP. Consanguineous families carrying recessive mutations in the glutamate decarboxylase 1 (GAD1) gene have been described resulting in impaired production of γ-aminobutyric acid. Treatment with drugs that potentiate γ-aminobutyric acid (for example, baclofen and benzodiazepine) ameliorate muscle rigidity and spasticity in these individuals, and have also been more generally used in CP.

### De novo point mutations in patients diagnosed with ataxic cerebral palsy [^115gmxTH]. Brain (2015). Low credibility.

Our data suggest that cerebral palsy is on a diagnostic and genetic continuum with intellectual disability, disorders of motor development and possibly autistic spectrum disorder, with these latter conditions already known to be caused by de novo mutations. Although, hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy is still likely to explain some cases of cerebral palsy, the identification of genetic causes suggest that this may be less frequent than previously thought. When foetal monitoring was first introduced hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy was considered to account for up to half of cerebral palsy cases, but this was not supported by subsequent studies and current evidence suggests that only 10–15% of cerebral palsy is caused by birth asphyxia. There are known risk factors such as low birth weight, prematurity, maternal infections and multiple gestations, but in these cases the cause is relatively obvious. For example maternal fever in labour is associated with an increased risk of cerebral palsy. However, in many cases, including those presented here, no obvious risk factors were identified and given the implications of this diagnosis to an individual and family, searching for the causation remains a priority. This suggests that great care should be taken in using the term cerebral palsy without extensive investigations to determine aetiology. Indeed in the genomic era, being able to redefine cases according to genetic causation may be extremely useful, allowing for better classifications of cerebral palsy, which in turn should assist management and understanding of prognosis. The identification of de novo mutations, which may only have a modest effect on reproductive fitness, also has important implications for genetic counselling of patients, as the risk to the offspring of such individuals will be 50%, whereas the risk to the parents of having further affected children is comparatively low and dependent on the (currently unknown) germline mosaicism rate. Even in cases where there are obvious perinatal risk factors, an underlying genetic mutation still may be present and a thorough search for de novo mutations is now clearly warranted before the cause can be ascribed to obstetric misadventure.

### Genetic insights into the causes and classification of cerebral palsies [^116kHjsL]. The Lancet: Neurology (2012). Medium credibility.

Cerebral palsy-the most common physical disability of childhood-is a clinical diagnosis encompassing a heterogeneous group of neurodevelopmental disorders that cause impairments of movement and posture that persist throughout life. Despite being commonly attributed to a range of environmental factors, particularly birth asphyxia, the specific cause of cerebral palsy remains unknown in most individuals. A growing body of evidence suggests that cerebral palsy is probably caused by multiple genetic factors, similar to other neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and intellectual disability. Recent advances in next-generation sequencing technologies have made possible rapid and cost-effective sequencing of the entire human genome. Novel cerebral palsy genes will probably be identified as more researchers and clinicians use this approach to study individuals with undiagnosed neurological disorders. As our knowledge of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of cerebral palsy increases, so will the possibility of developing genomically guided therapeutic interventions.

### Defining the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of neonatal encephalopathy and cerebral palsy [^113SHCes]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

The topics of neonatal encephalopathy and cerebral palsy, as well as hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, are of paramount importance to anyone who ventures to deliver infants. Criteria sufficient to define an acute intrapartum hypoxic event as sufficient to cause cerebral palsy have been advanced previously by both The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the International Cerebral Palsy Task Force. ACOG convened a task force that over the past 3 years reviewed these criteria based upon advances in scientific knowledge. In this review, we cover the slow but steady progression toward defining the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of neonatal encephalopathy and cerebral palsy. Four essential criteria are also advanced as prerequisites if one is to propose that an intrapartum hypoxic-ischemic insult has caused a moderate to severe neonatal encephalopathy that subsequently results in cerebral palsy. Importantly, all four criteria must be met: 1) evidence of metabolic acidosis in fetal umbilical cord arterial blood obtained at delivery (pH less than 7 and base deficit of 12 mmol/L or more), 2) early onset of severe or moderate neonatal encephalopathy in infants born at 34 or more weeks' gestation, 3) cerebral palsy of the spastic quadriplegic or dyskinetic type, and 4) exclusion of other identifiable etiologies, such as trauma, coagulation disorders, infectious conditions, or genetic disorders. Other criteria that together suggest intrapartum timing are also discussed.

### Risk factors and outcomes for cerebral palsy with hypoxic-ischemic brain injury patterns without documented neonatal encephalopathy [^116e9sx4]. Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Perinatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury is a leading cause of term-born cerebral palsy, the most common lifelong physical disability. Diagnosis is commonly made in the neonatal period by the combination of neonatal encephalopathy (NE) and typical neuroimaging findings. However, children without a history of neonatal encephalopathy may present later in childhood with motor disability and neuroimaging findings consistent with perinatal hypoxic-ischemic injury. We sought to determine the prevalence of such presentations using the retrospective viewpoint of a large multiregional cerebral palsy registry.

Methods

Patient cases were extracted from the Canadian Cerebral Palsy Registry with gestational age > 36 weeks, an MRI pattern consistent with hypoxic-ischemic injury (HII, acute total, partial prolonged, or combined), and an absence of postnatal cause for HII. Documentation of NE was noted. Maternal-fetal risk factors, labor and delivery, neonatal course, and clinical outcome were extracted. Comparisons were performed using χ² tests and multivariable logistic regression with multiple imputation. Propensity scores were used to assess for bias.

Results

Of the 170 children with MRI findings typical for HII, 140 (82.4%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 75.7%-87.7%) had documented NE and 29 (17.0%, 95% CI 11.7%-23.6%) did not. The group without NE had more abnormalities of amniotic fluid volume (odds ratio [OR] 15.8, 95% CI 1.2–835), had fetal growth restriction (OR 4.7, 95% CI 1.0–19.9), had less resuscitation (OR 0.03, 95% CI 0.007–0.08), had higher 5-minute Apgar scores (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.6–3.0), were less likely to have neonatal seizures (OR 0.004, 95% CI 0.00009–0.03), and did not receive therapeutic hypothermia. MRI was performed at a median 1.1 months (interquartile range [IQR] 0.67–12.8 months) for those with NE and 12.2 months (IQR 6.6–25.9) for those without (p = 0.011). Patterns of injury on MRI were seen in similar proportions. Hemiplegia was more common in those without documented NE (OR 5.1, 95% CI 1.5–16.1); rates of preserved ambulatory function were similar.

Discussion

Approximately one-sixth of term-born children with an eventual diagnosis of cerebral palsy and MRI findings consistent with perinatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury do not have documented neonatal encephalopathy, which was associated with abnormalities of fetal growth and amniotic fluid volume, and a less complex neonatal course. Long-term outcomes seem comparable with their peers with encephalopathy. The absence of documented neonatal encephalopathy does not exclude perinatal hypoxic-ischemic injury, which may have occurred antenatally and must be carefully evaluated with MRI.

### The complex aetiology of cerebral palsy [^111HePx9]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2018). Medium credibility.

Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most prevalent, severe and costly motor disability of childhood. Consequently, CP is a public health priority for prevention, but its aetiology has proved complex. In this Review, we summarize the evidence for a decline in the birth prevalence of CP in some high-income nations, describe the epidemiological evidence for risk factors, such as preterm delivery and fetal growth restriction, genetics, pregnancy infection and other exposures, and discuss the success achieved so far in prevention through the use of magnesium sulfate in preterm labour and therapeutic hypothermia for birth-asphyxiated infants. We also consider the complexities of disentangling prenatal and perinatal influences, and of establishing subtypes of the disorder, with a view to accelerating the translation of evidence into the development of strategies for the prevention of CP.

### Is cerebral palsy preventable? [^111Gudys]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To use evidence of good medical quality to update information on strategies for prevention of cerebral palsy, and on the success of these preventive efforts to date.

Recent Findings

Causes of cerebral palsy, and therefore promising approaches to prevention, differ by gestational age group and by clinical subtype. Neuroimaging and neuropathology indicate the importance of white matter disorders and of ischemic stroke in cerebral palsy; birth asphyxia, congenital malformations, placental pathology, and genetic variants also contribute to cerebral palsy risk. Multiplicity of risk factors markedly increases risk. Recent studies indicate that mild hypothermia lessens cerebral palsy risk in term infants with moderate neonatal encephalopathy, and the possibility that administration of magnesium sulphate to women in preterm labor may aid in primary prevention of cerebral palsy in very preterm infants.

Summary

Past efforts to prevent cerebral palsy have not had the benefits sought, but recent results provide new hope and new challenges.

### Epidemiology of cerebral palsy in Malawi [^113AVxZQ]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Aim

To describe the epidemiology of cerebral palsy (CP) among children in rural areas of Malawi.

Method

This was a cross-sectional study on children with CP younger than 18years from a rural district registered in the Malawi Cerebral Palsy Register. Community child protection workers, trained as CP key informants, identified children with CP using a population-based approach. A multidisciplinary medical team ascertained the CP diagnosis before registration. The children's baseline characteristics, CP risk factors, and comorbidities were documented. Descriptive and inferential analyses were completed.

Results

A total of 911 children were screened (December 2023-June 2024), and 538 were registered (median [interquartile range] age = 5years 11months [range: 2years 7months-11years 10 months], 59.3% male). Bilateral spastic CP was the most common type (46.3%), with most children (90.5%) classified in Gross Motor Function Classification System levels III to V. The observed CP prevalence was 1.7 per 1000 children. Perinatal asphyxia (40.5%) and cerebral malaria (12.3%) were the most common 'probable causes'. Institutional deliveries were reported in 95.1% and prolonged or obstructed labour was the most reported labour complication (42.7%).

Interpretation

Our findings suggest that preventable causes are the main drivers of CP in Malawi. As such, factors in the health care system that contribute to these causes need to be evaluated.

### Profile of children with cerebral palsy at a tertiary hospital in Eastern Nepal [^112Y1cmt]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The clinical spectrum of Cerebral palsy (CP) can differ in various places depending upon knowledge of the people and resources for prevention, diagnosis and management. Although studied extensively in high-resource countries, adequate data related to CP from resource-constraint settings are lacking. This study aims to describe the profile of children with CP at a tertiary care center in eastern Nepal.

Methods

This was a hospital-based cross-sectional descriptive study done from 2017 to 2018. Children 6 months to 15 years who presented with CP were enrolled and their clinical details recorded and described.

Results

Amongst 110 children with CP, 74.54% were male. Majority (76.36%) were 5 years or below with the median age being 3(2.00–4.75) years. Children with spastic quadriplegia (44.44%) and Gross Motor Function Classification System level III (41.81%) were most common. Etiologically, perinatal factors (64.54%) like perinatal asphyxia (35.45%) and prematurity (20.90%) and postnatal infections (25.45%) were common. The common comorbidities were intellectual disability (71.81%) and epilepsy (66.36%). The main treatment modalities were: antiepileptics (59.09%) and centre-based physiotherapy sessions (35.45%). School education was provided in 23.07% with special education in 11.53%.

Conclusions

This study describes the profile of CP at our centre in eastern Nepal. Predominance of perinatal complications and postnatal infections points towards the urgent need to further improve the perinatal and neonatal health care delivery system and practices.

### Quantification of structural changes in the corpus callosumin children with profound hypoxic-ischaemic brain injury [^111HXHr3]. Pediatric Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

Cerebral palsy is a neurodevelopmental condition that usually becomes clinically apparent in infancy and is non-progressive throughout life. The prevalence of cerebral palsy in the United States is approximately 2.4 per 1,000 live births and in Europe it increased from 0.8 to 1.4 per 1,000 live births between the 1970s and the 1990s. A definite cause for this increase has not been established, and it is entirely possible that this apparent increase actually reflects improved diagnosis and reporting. There are many reasons a child could develop cerebral palsy and it is customary to divide the aetiological agents into prenatal, perinatal and postnatal causes. Several sub-types of cerebral palsy have been determined by the clinical manifestations, and in some situations there is a relationship between the subtype and the aetiological cause or the time at which the injury occurred. For example, dyskinetic cerebral palsy most often arises as a result of perinatal injury, the two commonest causes being kernicterus and acute profound hypoxic–ischaemic brain injury. The relationship is imperfect; for example we have recently shown that approximately 50% of children with well-documented profound hypoxic–ischaemic brain injury have spastic cerebral palsy.

### Associations of risk factors and the number of risk factors with the classification, GMFCS level and comorbidities with cerebral palsy: a retrospective study [^112BhTeZ]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Risk factors during birth

Neonatal asphyxia during delivery and premature delivery are high-risk factors for CP. Epidemiological investigations have shown that preterm infants account for approximately 7% of all surviving newborns, but CP in preterm newborns accounts for approximately 40% of all CP cases.

A previous study revealed a significant correlation between preterm birth and CP in children. In our study, 243 individuals (45.3%) were born premature or had a low birth weight, which are the most common risk factors for spastic diplegia. Preterm delivery increases the risk of CP by 7.11 times because the organs of premature infants are still immature. Their ability to tolerate hypoxia is poor, which can cause developmental defects in the nervous system, especially in the periventricular white matter area, leading to periventricular white matter damage.

Neonatal asphyxia often occurs as a result of distress during childbirth. Asphyxiating brain injury is caused by events such as reduced blood flow, a lack of oxygen, and the restoration of blood flow after resuscitation. The underlying mechanisms involve oxidative stress from inflammatory reactions, the formation of free radicals, and the death of vulnerable areas in the brain, leading to injury, particularly in premature infants.

Risk factors after birth

When neonatal hyperbilirubinemia occurs, free bilirubin can pass through the blood‒brain barrier and combine with brain cells, causing neurotoxicity and resulting in brain cell damage. The site of central nervous system injury caused by bilirubin is located mainly in the extrapyramidal system, which is more common in patients with dyskinetic CP. A study revealed that 142 cases (26.5%) of hyperbilirubinemia were found in patients with dyskinetic CP, which is consistent with the findings of Saini et al.'s report. In premature infants at high risk for CP, neonatal intracranial haemorrhage is a primary neurological comorbidity. The pathophysiological mechanisms include the inherent fragility of germinal stromal blood vessels, fluctuations in cerebral blood flow, and coagulation disorders, all of which contribute to brain injury in premature infants. According to studies by Mert et al. children with CP who have experienced neonatal seizures are 3.3 times more likely to have a poor prognosis than are those without a history of neonatal seizures. This may be due to the negative impact of neonatal seizures on neurodevelopment, leading to brain lesions that can contribute to cognitive, behavioural, or seizure issues later in life.

### Quantification of structural changes in the corpus callosumin children with profound hypoxic-ischaemic brain injury [^114peWDv]. Pediatric Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Reduced blood supply or oxygen delivery around the time of birth is often termed "birth asphyxia" and is a cause of neonatal encephalopathy. In some cases there is lasting brain injury visible on MR imaging, usually in children who have sustained moderate or severe hypoxia/ischaemia. The pattern of such hypoxic–ischaemic brain injury on subsequent brain MR imaging studies depends on several factors, but most important are the gestational maturity and the severity and duration of the hypoxic–ischaemic event. Children with hypoxic–ischaemic brain injury who are born at or near term (37 weeks or more) usually have one of two patterns of injury. If the hypoxic–ischaemic event is short-lasting (10–25 min) but severe (e.g. following uterine rupture) the injury tends to involve the basal ganglia, thalami and paracentral lobules and is called acute profound hypoxic–ischaemic brain injury (Fig. 1). If the hypoxic–ischaemic event is more prolonged, with less severe reduction in blood supply or oxygen delivery (e.g. incomplete placental abruption) the parasagittal watershed regions of the cerebral hemispheres tend to be injured and this is called prolonged partial hypoxic–ischaemic brain injury. Mixed patterns of acute profound and prolonged partial hypoxic–ischaemic brain injury can occur. Children affected by either of those injuries are likely to incur some form of cerebral palsy.

Fig. 1
MR images in a 6-year old boy with dyskinetic cerebral palsy who has the typical neuroimaging findings of acute profound hypoxic–ischaemic brain injury. a, b Axial T2-weighted MR images at the level of the basal ganglia (a) and peri-rolandic cortex (b) show gliosis and reduction in volume of the putamina (open arrows), thalami and paracentral lobules (solid arrows). c A mid-sagittal T1-weighted MR image shows a focal reduction in thickness in the posterior part of the body of the corpus callosum (arrows)

In this paper we describe a group of children with acute profound hypoxic–ischaemic brain injury on the basis of perinatal history, clinical outcome and MR imaging findings. Empirical observations suggest that there is specific corpus callosum volume loss in these children, although the changes in some cases can be subtle.

We quantitatively analysed the dimensions of the corpus callosum and hypothesised that the corpus callosum has a reduced size secondary to acute profound hypoxic–ischaemic brain injury and that the volume loss is focal, involving the region that carries the commissural axons from the paracentral lobules.

### Cerebral palsy characteristics in term-born children with and without detectable perinatal risk factors: a cross-sectional study [^111AQiKP]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

In this national registry from a high‐resource setting, children with CP born at term lacking detectable perinatal CP risk factors were more likely to be female, have an uneventful pregnancy and delivery, have more focal injury (including perinatal stroke), have predominantly hemiparetic/unilateral CP, be ambulatory, and communicate with words more than children with CP who had detectable risk factors. They were not more likely to have experienced a postneonatal brain injury, and we propose the etiology of their CP may have been an initially asymptomatic perinatal brain injury (such as antenatal germinal matrix hemorrhage with venous infarct). These findings are expected to be generalizable to other populations with similar perinatal care and resources. Understanding this phenotype, which encompasses a quarter of children with CP in our registry, helps explain the limitations of CP screening tools based on perinatal risk factors, and highlights the importance of supporting primary care providers in recognizing early signs of CP such as subtle hemiparesis, and initiating prompt referral for further evaluation and treatment.

### Cerebral palsy after neonatal encephalopathy: do neonates with suspected asphyxia have worse outcomes? [^114Z5JmX]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Aim

We sought to investigate how brain injury and severity, and neurological subtype of cerebral palsy (CP) differed in term-born children with CP after neonatal encephalopathy, between those with suspected birth asphyxia and those without.

Method

Using the Canadian CP Registry, which included 1001 children, those with CP born at ≥ 36 wks after moderate or severe neonatal encephalopathy, were dichotomized according to the presence or absence of suspected birth asphyxia. Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) scores, neurological subtypes, comorbidities, and magnetic resonance imaging findings were compared.

Results

Of the 147 term-born children with CP (82 males, 65 females; median age 37 months, interquartile range [IQR] 26–52.5) who after moderate or severe neonatal encephalopathy had the required outcome data, 61 (41%) met criteria for suspected birth asphyxia. They had a higher frequency of non-ambulatory GMFCS status (odds ratio [OR] 3.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.72–6.8), spastic quadriplegia (OR 2.8, 95% CI 1.4–5.6), non-verbal communication skills impairment (OR 4.2, 95% CI 2.0–8.6), isolated deep grey matter injury (OR 4.1, 95% CI 1.8–9.5), a lower frequency of spastic hemiplegia (OR 0.17, 95% CI 0.07–0.42), focal injury (OR 0.20; 95% CI 0.04–0.93), and more comorbidities (p = 0.017) than those who did not meet criteria.

Interpretation

Term-born children who develop CP after neonatal encephalopathy with suspected birth asphyxia have a greater burden of disability than those without suspected birth asphyxia.

### Stroke in newborn infants [^114NYgar]. The Lancet: Neurology (2004). Medium credibility.

The few days before and after birth are a time of special risk for stroke in both mother and infant, probably related to activation of coagulation mechanisms in this critical period. Arterial ischaemic stroke around the time of birth is recognised in about one in 4000 full-term infants, and may present with neurological and systemic signs in the newborn. Neonatal seizures are most commonly the clinical finding that triggers assessment. In other children, perinatal stroke is recognised only retrospectively, with emerging hemiparesis or seizures after the early months of life. Risk factors for perinatal stroke include hereditary or acquired thrombophilias and environmental factors. Perinatal stroke underlies an important share of congenital hemiplegic cerebral palsy, and probably some spastic quadriplegic cerebral palsy and seizure disorders. There is much to be learned about the natural history of perinatal stroke, and there are as yet no evidence-based strategies for prevention or treatment.

### Hypothermia for perinatal asphyxia: trial-based quality of life at 6–7 years [^117FcbRF]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

Study population

Parents of surviving children who participated in the TOBY Trial were invited to take part in the TOBY Children Follow-up Study when their child reached 6–7 years of age. The findings of TOBY Children Follow-up Study are reported elsewhere in detail; however, in brief, the study reported that at 6–7 years and when compared with the control group, a higher number of children in the hypothermia group had survived with an IQ score ≥ 85, survived without neurological abnormalities and had significant reductions in the risk of cerebral palsy and of moderate or severe disability.

As part of that study, parents received a postal questionnaire including the HRQL HUI, and questions about the use of healthcare services by their child over the previous 6 months (to be reported elsewhere). The study included centres from the UK, Sweden, Hungary, Finland and Israel, but UK centres contributed most to the sample used in the analysis.

### Is perinatal asphyxia predictable? [^112bXPxo]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Cases of neonatal encephalopathy related to perinatal asphyxia are called hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) and can lead to long-term neurological sequelae and cerebral palsy.

The Sarnat and Sarnat classification is still the universally accepted scoring system to provide information about the prognosis for the asphyxiated neonate. This staging is based on the infant's clinical presentation, examination findings and the presence of seizures, with emphasis on the duration of symptoms.

Both clinical (Thompson scale) and instrumental (cerebral function monitor/aEEG) assessment are validated by international literature for classifying the severity of damage immediately after birth. This allows for initiating the correct treatment (ie Therapeutic Hypothermia) as soon as possible.

Perinatal asphyxia is defined as at least one of the following characteristics in a neonate: 10 min Apgar score ≤ 5, need for resuscitation > 10 min, metabolic acidosis (pH ≤ 7.0 or BE ≤ -12 mMol/L in umbilical artery (UA) or within 1 h of life).

There is a dose-dependent relationship between the degree of acidosis and the likelihood of adverse neonatal outcome.

Both ante and intrapartum risk factors have been associated with perinatal asphyxia and HIE. Some of these are clinically recognized as asphyxial birth events (sentinel events): uterine rupture, placental abruptio, shoulder dystocia and cord prolapse. However, the majority of risk factors (preeclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction, intrapartum fever, emergency delivery) seem to interact in the causal pathway to HIE rather than being its direct antecedent. In addition to the historically described risk factors, new ones have recently been identified, such as obesity and previous cesarean section. Nevertheless, results from a large registry of neonatal encephalopathy show that half of the neonates had neither asphyxia nor inflammatory indicators, suggesting that a large number of cases remain unexplained.

Fetal heart rate (FHR) monitoring provides important information about fetal status. However, its role in the prediction of fetal asphyxia remains controversial, despite efforts directed at its interpretation and the development of protocols for the management of abnormal patterns.

To summarize, there are a number of conditions that have been associated with the presence of perinatal asphyxia and its extreme consequence, HIE. Nevertheless, it is problematic to identify the sequence of events that leads to perinatal asphyxia during prenatal and intrapartum care.

In this context the objective of our study was to evaluate the association between perinatal asphyxia and HIE with the presence of risk factors and/or abnormal FHR findings in order to improve maternal and neonatal management.

### Cerebral palsy: classification and epidemiology [^114jRCZR]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

This article reviews the historical background, classification, and etiology of cerebral palsy (CP), the most common motor disability of childhood. The various methods employed to measure the prevalence of CP in the population are examined. Causes of CP are numerous, and the etiology multi-factorial. Risk factors are categorized by the timing of their proposed occurrence: prenatal, perinatal, and postnatal. The leading prenatal and perinatal risk factors for CP are birth weight and gestational age. Other risk factors include neonatal encephalopathy, multiple pregnancy, infection and inflammation, and a variety of genetic factors.

### Clinical profile and associated comorbidities of cerebral palsy in children visiting orotta national referral hospital, Eritrea: a cross-sectional study [^112opMZJ]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Data collection tool and approach

A structured, pretested, and pre-coded questionnaire (Additional file 1) was adopted upon review of similar questionnaires and was used to interview the caregivers on socio-demographic data, and history of the pregnancy, birth, and post neonatal incidents. The interview was conducted by medical doctors appropriately trained on how to use the questionnaire. Prenatal risk factors included maternal alcohol consumption, smoking, fever/infection, malaria, or abnormal bleeding during pregnancy. Perinatal factors comprised of information on the place of delivery, complications during delivery, prematurity, fetal presentation, and other notable events. As the APGAR score nor the arterial blood gas analysis of all the study participants could be attained, mothers were questioned on how fast their child cried at birth, and the requirement for respiratory resuscitation as a proxy indicator of perinatal asphyxia. Furthermore, potential post neonatal incidents leading to CP were sought and information on co-morbidities was investigated. This included epilepsy, feeding problems, skin lesions related to pressure sores, and speech and language impairment. School attendance rate and performance of the children with CP were asked as well.

Similar to other studies, a three-step inclusion/exclusion criteria were used (Additional file 2). In the first step, children were screened by the principal investigator (YK) using two questions from the ten WHO Screen Questions (Questions 1 and 5) that correlate with motor disability. Next, each one of those who screened positive on the two WHO screening questions underwent further assessments by one of the four attending physicians, i.e. YK, ET, and other two medical doctors, assisted by an observer flow chart, adapted from the 'Decision Tree' in SCPE. Finally, all the children were reassessed by either one of the senior pediatricians (ZO or MM), deciding their inclusion or exclusion.

Once the definition of CP and other inclusion criteria were fulfilled, the children were subtyped according to their predominant movement disorders using the classification tree of the SCPE, and the subtypes were verified by the senior pediatricians (ZO & MM). The subtypes were (a) bilateral spastic CP; (b) unilateral spastic CP; (c) dyskinetic CP and (d) ataxic CP subtypes. Bilateral spastic CP was further classified into spastic diplegic CP and quadriplegic CP. The severity of gross motor function impairments was classified with the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS).

### Familial risk of cerebral palsy: population based cohort study [^115G815J]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Cerebral palsy is the most common cause of physical disability in children, affecting approximately two in 1000 live births. Cerebral palsy comprises several more or less distinct subtypes with a wide spectrum of severity of motor disability, often accompanied by visual impairment, intellectual deficit, or epilepsy. A diagnosis cannot be reliably made until the age of at least 2 years, sometimes not until several years later for milder cases.

Cerebral palsy originates from damage to the immature brain, the causes of which are still largely unknown. However, several risk factors in pregnancy and the perinatal period have been identified, among them preterm delivery, multiple fetuses, atypical intrauterine growth, intrauterine exposure to infection, placental pathology, congenital malformations, birth asphyxia, perinatal infection, and perinatal stroke. Previous studies have recognised a possible heritable component of cerebral palsy. The condition recurs more than expected among twins, as well as among siblings in general, and an excess risk of cerebral palsy in children with a parent or other family member affected by the condition has been reported. Several candidate genes or single nucleotide polymorphisms have been investigated to explain familial clustering of cerebral palsy, with extensions to interactions with clinical factors and other genes, although positive findings have proved hard to replicate.

We used data from a large population based cohort to systematically investigate recurrence of cerebral palsy among twins and first, second, and third degree relatives and thus to shed light on patterns of inheritance.

### Profile of children with cerebral palsy at a tertiary hospital in Eastern Nepal [^113nMBKs]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Results

In this study, there were 110 children with CP presenting to our hospital during the study period. Amongst them, majority (74.54%) were male. The age range of children enrolled in the study was 6 months to 15 years, with a median age of 3 years. Most children were aged 5 or below (76.36%). The mean age of identification of problem was 3.00 ± 1.23 years. Seventy six (69.09%) children had early markers and tone abnormalities suggestive of CP while 26 (23.63%) had more static and characterised CP and 8 (7.27%) were at risk of CP. The details of demographic and clinical characteristics are shown in Table 1.

Table 1
Demographic & clinical characteristics of children with cerebral palsy (n = 110)

a GMFCS Gross Motor Function Classification System

The assessment of risk factors for CP showed that no definite risk factor for CP could be identified in 21 (19.09%) of children. The remaining 81% of children had at least one risk factor, with 24 children (21.81%) identified as having multiple risk factors. The majority of children had perinatal risks (64.54%), such as perinatal asphyxia (35.45%) and prematurity (20.90%), as shown in Table 2.

### A clinical and etiologic profile of spastic diplegia [^112rTY4Z]. Pediatric Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

To identify the clinical and etiologic profile of children with spastic diplegia, the medical records of patients with spastic diplegia in a single practice over a 12-year period were systematically and retrospectively reviewed. Clinical factors and possible etiology based on investigations were identified. Univariate and binomial logistical regression analyses were undertaken to identify factors correlating with an etiologic determination. Chart review identified 54 children with spastic diplegia. There were 31 (57.4%) preterm children and 23 (42.6%) term children. Periventricular leukomalacia was diagnosed in 24 (44.4%) children (26.1% of term children, 58.1% of preterm children). An etiology was not identified in 25 (46.3%) children: 14 (60.9%) term children and 11 (35.5%) preterm children. Periventricular leukomalacia among all children correlated with a birth weight less than 2000 gm (P = 0.037), history of neonatal resuscitation (P = 0.004), and gestation less than 33 weeks (P = 0.001). Factors specifically associated with periventricular leukomalacia in term children were a problematic perinatal history (P = 0.011), a history of neonatal resuscitation (P = 0.011), and a history of neonatal respiratory distress (P = 0.046). Regression analysis revealed a correlation between an abnormal perinatal history and an etiology of periventricular leukomalacia among term children (odds ratio 8.67, 95% confidence interval 2.51–29.97, P = 0.001). Approximately half of all children with spastic diplegia encountered in clinical practice will have an etiology identified.

### Etiologic profile of spastic quadriplegia in children [^115AqqGc]. Pediatric Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

The etiologic profile and possible predictors of etiology in children with spastic quadriplegia were assessed in a consecutive cohort of children with this motor impairment. Medical records from a single pediatric neurology practice over a 14-year interval were retrospectively and systematically reviewed. Variables comprised possible demographic, prenatal, perinatal, and postnatal risk factors. Of the 99 patients included in the study, 39 were premature (< 37 weeks gestation). The overall etiologic yield was 83%. The top three diagnoses were hypoxic-ischemic perinatal asphyxia (33%), periventricular leukomalacia (15%), and central nervous system infections (11%). In premature children, the most common diagnoses were periventricular leukomalacia (33%), perinatal asphyxia (26%), and central nervous system infections (15%). In term-born children, the most frequent diagnoses were perinatal asphyxia (37%), metabolic disease (12%), and structural malformation or infection (9% each). Factors predicting the identification of an etiology included male sex (P = 0.05), low birth weight (P = 0.003), prematurity (P = 0.01), perinatal complications (P = 0.002), and neonatal encephalopathy (P = 0.006). The etiologic yield in patients with spastic quadriplegia was 83%, with differing underlying etiologies depending on gestational age. These results should help guide physicians in investigating possible underlying etiologies in patients with spastic quadriplegia.

### A study of an intelligent system to support decision making in the management of labour using the cardiotocograph-the INFANT study protocol [^111pLDJk]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

Long term

PARCA-R composite score at the age of 2 years for all infants with trial primary outcome and a further subset of 7000 babies.

Note: Neurodevelopmental delay and cerebral palsy are the most important long-term adverse outcomes associated with perinatal asphyxia. However the incidence of moderate or severe cerebral palsy is of the order of 1.5–2.5/1000 live births, depending on the definition and the method of ascertainment. There is also uncertainty about the proportion of these cases that results from intrapartum asphyxia in mature infants; however, 30% is a reasonable estimate3. Therefore, given the rarity of this outcome, it is unlikely that a clear difference could be demonstrated between the two groups with a trial of 46,000 births. So in order to have reassurance that any benefits of the intervention, with respect to short term outcomes, have not occurred at the expense of later neurodevelopmental delay, we will measure neurodevelopment in a proportion of the surviving children at the age of 2 years.

### Data on cerebral palsy in Vietnam will inform clinical practice and policy in low and middle-income countries [^112fR5PT]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To document known risk factors, clinical severity, associated impairments and rehabilitation status of children presenting with cerebral palsy (CP) to the National Children's Hospital (NCH) in Hanoi, Vietnam.

Materials and Methods

Active prospective ascertainment of cases of CP presenting between June and November 2017 to the NCH using surveillance modelled on the Paediatric Active Enhanced Disease Surveillance system in Australia.

Results

Data were collected on 765 children with CP (mean age: 2years 7months (SD 2y 6mo). Mean age at diagnosis was 1year 8months (SD 1y 9mo). Children predominantly had spastic CP (95.2%, n = 729), most were quadriplegic (69.6%, n = 532) and 60.3% (n = 454) were Gross Motor Functional Classification System level III-V. Of the children 76.2% (n = 583) had one/more associated impairments. 36.3% (n = 276) had presumed perinatal asphyxia, 26.5% (n = 202) were preterm. Physiotherapy (94.3%, n = 663) was the most common form of intervention used. Only 2.6% (n = 12) of the children who would have benefitted from assistive devices had wheelchairs.

Conclusion

We established hospital-based surveillance of CP in Hanoi and confirmed a high burden and severity of CP with potentially preventable risk factors. These data will inform clinician training and health policy and identify need for evidence-based care and assistive devices. IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONWe identified a high number of children with severe forms of cerebral palsy (CP) in Hanoi, Vietnam through hospital-based surveillance. There is an urgent need for clinician training and access to and use of evidence-based interventions including assistive technology. This study will inform local capacity building and health policy for improved diagnosis and care of children with CP in Vietnam and other low and middle-income countries.

### De novo point mutations in patients diagnosed with ataxic cerebral palsy [^113A3zNT]. Brain (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

The cerebral palsies are defined as a group of permanent disorders of movement and posture that are attributed to non-progressive disturbances that occurred in the developing foetal or infant brain. They are classified into clinical subtypes including spastic, dyskinetic, dystonic and ataxic groups, but there may be additional disturbances of cognition, communication and behaviour. Some patients have brain imaging abnormalities, such as focal infarction, brain malformations and periventricular leukomalacia; however, not all children with cerebral palsy have abnormal brain imaging and determining the aetiology in such cases is particularly challenging.

Cerebral palsy is a common disorder affecting approximately 1 in 500 of the population in Western industrialized nations, but despite being so common, a proven cause is not always found. Although recent studies have suggested that only 10–20% of cerebral palsy cases can be explained by birth asphyxia, there remains a widespread belief that obstetric misadventure or even negligence is the main cause of cerebral palsy, and many parents with children diagnosed with cerebral palsy enquire about the possibility of damage during the delivery process. Obstetrics therefore has one of the highest rates of litigation within the medical profession and one of the highest rates of outcome favouring the plaintiff. Indeed, an internet search for the term 'cerebral palsy' provides dozens of legal services for claims of negligence and as a result of this climate of litigation in developed countries the Caesarian section rate (and its complications) has soared in the last 40 years.

### William John little (1810–1894) [^117C3Wif]. Journal of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

His experience, both as a patient and a doctor, in particular in treating young children, resulted in a series of papers in which he described children suffering from spasticity and stiffness of extremities, deformities of upper and lower extremities, paresis and paralysis. Little compared the stiffness that his patients had to tetanus spasms. The connection between the above disorders and perinatal disorders became more and more clear to him. As his experience grew, Little classified children's disorders into groups. Of particular importance was the connection he made between bone, joint and muscle deformities and disorders of the neurological system. He associated these disorders with prematurity, difficult delivery, in particular forceps delivery, as well as perinatal asphyxia and tremors. Little was the first person to explain in detail the mechanism involved in muscle contractures, particularly spastic ones. Additionally, Little described cases of pseudohypertrophic muscular dystrophy at around the same time as Edward Meryon and before the eponymous description of Guillaume Duchenne. As a result of his observations and growing experience, Little became more and more aware that surgical treatment of cerebral palsy had its limitations. The initial fascination with tenotomies gave way to a much more cautious approach. This was caused by Little's observations that some treatment, corrective in theory, in fact impaired children's motor function. This was an exceptionally mature idea at the time when orthopaedics was going through the period of "post-operative disaster". This knowledge was reflected in his major work on this topic based on the observations of over 200 patients. Little presented his main ideas in 1861 in a meeting of the Obstetrical Society of London. His views stirred a heated debate. He highlighted that the disease was caused by problems during pregnancy and delivery. He underlined the impact of such conditions as placenta praevia and prematurity. Little believed that cerebral palsy resulted from post-partum asphyxia, which distorted the blood flow and in this way damaged the child's brain. He was convinced that the cause of the disease was lack of oxygen during delivery, while rejecting the hypothesis of the impact of "injuries" suffered during delivery. Little also described in detail different types of paralysis: hemiplegia, diplegia (sometimes known as "Little's diplegia"), and tetraplegia. He also pointed to the possibility of flaccid paralysis. He saw the link between a degree of paresis and a degree of mental retardation in patients.

### Characteristics of children with cerebral palsy in the post-therapeutic hypothermia era [^117EA2aT]. Journal of Child Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, caused by an intrapartum event leading to perinatal asphyxia, is the most frequent and well-studied cause of neonatal encephalopathy. It is associated with later neurologic morbidities, including cerebral palsy, seizures, cognitive impairment, and behavioral challenges. Therapeutic hypothermia, initiated within 6 hours of birth and continued for 72 hours, has been established as a safe and effective therapy for neonates born at greater than 35 weeks of gestational age, who present with clinical evidence of moderate or severe neonatal encephalopathy. ‐ It has been shown to decrease mortality or moderate to severe neurodevelopmental disability at 18–24 months of age, with a number needed to treat of 6 to 7. Therapeutic hypothermia has also been shown to improve neurocognitive outcomes at school age. At our institution, therapeutic hypothermia was implemented in 2008 with a specific referral and treatment algorithm shared with regional birthing centers.

In the acute neonatal period, outcomes of infants with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy are often difficult to predict. Clinicians need to know what available information can be used to better counsel parents on long-term prognosis. The literature on hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, therapeutic hypothermia, and cerebral palsy is extensive. However, there are some gaps in the literature in terms of examining the profile of children with cerebral palsy who received therapeutic hypothermia after intrapartum asphyxia (IAP), both in terms of neonatal factors and long-term cerebral palsy outcomes.

In addition, parents of infants with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy will often ask concrete functional questions about long-term prognosis including: Will my child be able to walk? Will my child be able to speak and communicate with me? Will my child be feeding independently? These functional questions have a direct bearing on caregiver burden and eventual autonomy.

Our primary objective was to explore the profile of children with cerebral palsy secondary to intrapartum asphyxia who were treated with therapeutic hypothermia at a single regional tertiary center. Specifically, we set out to look at their clinical characteristics in the neonatal period and their cerebral palsy profiles as children. In addition, we compared this profile with the profile of children with cerebral palsy prior to therapeutic hypothermia to see if there had been any shift in the pattern of later cerebral palsy with the introduction of therapeutic hypothermia. Finally, we compared the neonatal characteristics (including birth characteristics, cord pH, Apgar scores, and magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] findings) between children with an eventual mild cerebral palsy phenotype and those with a more severe phenotype ultimately.

### From "apparent death" to "birth asphyxia": a history of blame [^113BqPon]. Pediatric Research (2018). Low credibility.

Since the sixteenth century, competition between midwives and surgeons has created a culture of blame around the difficult delivery. In the late seventeenth century, 100 years before oxygen was discovered, researchers associated "apparent death of the newborn" with impaired respiratory function of the placenta. The diagnosis "birth asphyxia" replaced the term "apparent death of the newborn" during the mass phobia of being buried alive in the eighteenth century. This shifted the interpretation from unavoidable fate to a preventable condition. Although the semantic inaccuracy ("pulselessness") was debated, "asphyxia" was not scientifically defined until 1992. From 1792 the diagnosis was based on a lack of oxygen. "Blue" and "white" asphyxia were perceived as different disorders in the eighteenth, and as different grades of the same disorder in the nineteenth century. In 1862, William Little linked birth asphyxia with cerebral palsy, and although never confirmed, his hypothesis was accepted by scientists and the public. Fetal well-being was assessed by auscultating heart beats since 1822, and continuous electronic fetal monitoring was introduced in the 1960s without scientific assessment. It neither diminished the incidence of birth asphyxia nor of cerebral palsy, but rather raised the rate of cesarean sections and litigation against obstetricians and midwives.

### Antecedents of cerebral palsy and perinatal death in term and late preterm singletons [^112zryR2]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the antecedents of cerebral palsy and of perinatal death in singletons born at or after 35 weeks of gestation.

Methods

From a total population of singletons born at or after 35 weeks of gestation, we identified 494 with cerebral palsy and 508 neonates in a matched control group, 100 neonatal deaths, and 73 intrapartum stillbirths (all deaths in selected birth years). Neonatal death and cerebral palsy were categorized as without encephalopathy, after neonatal encephalopathy, or after neonatal encephalopathy considered hypoxic-ischemic. We examined the contribution of potentially asphyxial birth events, inflammation, fetal growth restriction, and birth defects recognized by age 6 years to each of these outcomes and to intrapartum stillbirths.

Results

The odds of total cerebral palsy after potentially asphyxial birth events or inflammation were modestly increased (odds ratio [OR] 1.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1–3.2 and OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.0–4.2, respectively). However, potentially asphyxial birth events occurred in 34% of intrapartum stillbirths and 21.6% of cerebral palsy after hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. Inflammatory markers occurred in 13.9% and 11.9% of these outcomes, respectively. Growth restriction contributed significantly to all poor outcome groups. Birth defects were recognized in 5.5% of neonates in the control group compared with 60% of neonatal deaths and more than half of cases of cerebral palsy without hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. In children with cerebral palsy, a potentially asphyxial birth event, inflammation, or both were experienced by 12.6%, whereas growth restriction, a birth defect, or both were experienced by 48.6% (P < .001).

Conclusion

Fetal growth restriction and birth defects recognized by age 6 years were more substantial contributors to cerebral palsy and neonatal death than potentially asphyxial birth events and inflammation.

### Associations of risk factors and the number of risk factors with the classification, GMFCS level and comorbidities with cerebral palsy: a retrospective study [^111GAtx8]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cerebral palsy (CP) is a group of persistent motor and postural developmental disorders and limited activity syndromes caused by nonprogressive brain damage in developing foetuses or infants. In children with CP, motor disorders are often linked with sensory, perceptual, cognitive, communication, and behavioural disorders, as well as epilepsy and secondary musculoskeletal problems.

On the basis of population-based studies conducted globally, CP is estimated to have a prevalence of 0.1% to 0.4%. In 12 provinces and cities in China, the prevalence of CP among children aged 1–6 years is reported to be 2.46 cases per 1000 children, leading to significant familial and social burdens, as well as increased utilization of medical resources. Currently, the complex causes and development of CP remain unclear. The high-risk factors for CP are diverse and multifaceted. These risk factors can occur before, during, or after birth over an extended period. Additionally, these risk factors interact with each other, forming a complex network that contributes to the development of the condition. Regrettably, previous research on the risk factors for CP in children has been somewhat limited in scope, often focusing solely on birth and foetal factors. For example, one study highlighted that preterm birth, asphyxia, and hyperbilirubinemia significantly increase the risk of CP, with perinatal and maternal factors frequently being overlooked. Additionally, the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) level in children with CP directly impacts their quality of life and daily functioning.

### Predictors of severity and outcome of global developmental delay without definitive etiologic yield: a prospective observational study [^111KUR67]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Developmental assessment was completed by an experienced developmental pediatrician using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development for children up to 3 < years of age, and the Griffiths Scales for Mental Development and the Athina Test for older children. The lower DQ value was taken into account when both Griffiths Scales for Mental Development and the Athina Test were used. Developmental quotient was calculated as percentage of functional age compared to chronological age.

Information regarding the perinatal and the neonatal period was obtained by a systematic examination of the participants' medical records, including personal health booklets, hospital discharge notes, follow-up or outpatient information notes, and any related laboratory or imagistic examination from the personal medical files. A detailed history was also obtained from the parents and the referring physician was contacted for any additional information. The diagnosis of HIE was based on the criteria established by the American Academy of Pediatrics task Force on Neonatal Encephalopathy and Cerebral Palsy, which include evidence of metabolic acidosis in fetal umbilical cord arterial blood at delivery, early onset of severe or moderate neonatal encephalopathy, and cerebral palsy of the spastic quadriplegic or dyskinetic type. If the diagnosis of HIE was not definitive, but there was evidence of a non-specific asphyxial insult (i.e. a sentinel hypoxic event occurring immediately before or during labor, sudden and sustained fetal bradycardia or absence of fetal heart rate variability, Apgar score of less than 5 beyond 5 < minutes) without pathologic findings in neonatal neuroimaging, the child was considered as having experienced birth asphyxia without significant CNS involvement and was not excluded from the study. Pathologic neonatal neuroimaging (brain ultrasound, CT, MRI) findings included intraventricular hemorrhage, ventriculomegaly (symmetrical or asymmetrical), periventricular hyperechogenicity (localized or diffused), multiple micro or macro cysts in the periventricular white matter, and cortical or subcortical infarcts. Children with such findings were excluded from the study irrespectively of the clinical diagnosis.

### Best practices guidelines for trauma center recognition of child abuse, elder abuse, and intimate partner violence [^113mZs5R]. ACS (2019). High credibility.

Child abuse — other considerations in pediatric fractures emphasize that some infants and children sustain fractures due to increased bone fragility, and clinicians should consider alternative etiologies. Perform a differential diagnosis of common conditions affecting bone strength, especially when the history suggests a mechanism other than PCA. Conditions that increase the propensity for fracture include collagen disorders such as osteogenesis imperfecta, malnutrition and deficiencies (e.g., rickets and scurvy), chronic renal disease, or any condition that subjects the child to prolonged immobility (e.g., severely involved cerebral palsy). A child with severely involved spastic cerebral palsy and low bone mineral density could potentially develop a femur fracture from routine care such as transferring or diapering. Children with osteogenesis imperfecta can present with multiple fractures in various locations with seemingly minor trauma. Fractures can also occur in neonates during vaginal or caesarian deliveries (e.g., difficult deliveries due to shoulder dystocia) that are discovered in later stages of healing and misinterpreted for abuse. Premature infants requiring extensive and prolonged neonatal ICU support are also are at risk of osteopenia and fractures in the first few months of life. For all children presenting with fractures, consider the possibility of a less common condition that can explain the fractures present.

### Changing trends in cerebral palsy prevalence: an opportunity to consider etiological pathways [^11574weB]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Cerebral palsy (CP) is often accompanied by severe comorbidities and causes challenges to those affected, their families, and health services. Hence, any decreases in the prevalence of CP at the population level would be welcome news. Reports of a decreasing trend in CP prevalence in parts of Europe between the 1980s and the early 2000swere greeted with cautious optimism because prevalence could rebound in specific subgroups, including children born extremely preterm. Evidence of an overall prevalence decrease in other areas of the world in recent years would offer reassurance of a sustained decline. Smithers‐Sheedy et al. provide such evidence in a comprehensive description of pre‐ and perinatally acquired CP trends in Australia. Capitalizing on an excellent resource, the nationwide Australian Cerebral Palsy Register, the authors report a one‐third reduction in the prevalence of CP at 5 years of age between 1995 and 2014 in singleton children. The decline was evident in all gestational age groups, although it was somewhat more pronounced in children born extremely preterm. In this group, and among children born at term, there was a decrease in moderate to severe CP. While the prevalence of bilateral spastic CP, the most common type, decreased, the prevalence of both dyskinetic and hypotonic CP appeared to increase. Importantly, any concomitant changes in child mortality do not obscure these findings because deceased children with known CP were included in the numerators.

The authors attribute the declining trends in pre‐ and perinatally acquired CP prevalence to the concurrent implementation of measures that improve maternal and perinatal health. Among children born extremely preterm, who are at the highest risk of CP, measures may involve prenatal corticosteroids to enhance lung maturation, delayed cord clamping, magnesium sulfate to prevent brain injury, and specific changes in neonatal intensive care unit practices. Although the total and direct effects of these interventions on the incidence of CP may be challenging to prove at the population level, evidence on indirect effects is closer at hand since they are primarily aimed at preventing brain injury from asphyxia and asphyxia‐related neonatal morbidities mediate most of the effect of extremely and very‐preterm birth in CP. Among children born at term, who are the majority of those with CP, early detection of conditions leading to ischemic brain damage, and the advent of therapeutic hypothermia of infants with hypoxic–ischemic encephalopathy, may have played a role.

### Prevalence and risk factors associated with birth asphyxia among neonates delivered in China: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1162Ni4U]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Surviving neonates with birth asphyxia often have many complications, including impairments to the brain, lungs, kidneys, gastrointestinal system, and cardiovascular functions. Neonatal brain injury caused by asphyxia is one of the major causes of postnatal neurological dysfunction in children. Hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE) refers to brain injury caused by hypoxia and ischaemia resulting from perinatal asphyxia, which clinically manifests as a series of central nervous system abnormalities. According to China's diagnostic criteria, HIE can be confirmed if all of the following four criteria are met (if criterion 4 cannot be immediately determined, the case can be considered a provisional diagnosis): 1) a clear obstetric history indicating foetal distress, such as severe foetal distress signs (foetal heart rate < 100 beats/min for more than 5 min and/or grade III meconium staining of amniotic fluid), or a history of significant asphyxia during labour; 2) severe asphyxia at birth, as defined as an Apgar score ≤ 3 at 1 min, persisting at ≤ 5 at 5 min, or an umbilical artery blood pH ≤ 7.00 at birth; 3) neurological symptoms appearing shortly after birth and persisting for more than 24 h; and 4) seizures or brain injury caused by electrolyte disturbances, intracranial haemorrhage, birth trauma, intrauterine infections, hereditary metabolic diseases, or other congenital disorders. A study in Spain revealed that the probability of developing HIE in children with severe asphyxia is 25.6%, and among those with HIE, the incidence of neurological sequelae is 16.5%. These neurological sequelae include cerebral palsy, intellectual disability, and epilepsy, which can place a significant burden on both the child's family and society.

### Cortical deafness in children: scoping review and case report of a bilateral perinatal stroke [^113WVHvR]. Journal of Child Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The case report describes a 7-year-old girl with left unilateral spastic cerebral palsy and dysarthria, diagnosed with cortical deafness due to bilateral strokes affecting the superior temporal gyrus. The case highlights the clinical presentation and management of pediatric cortical deafness. This report, coupled with the scoping review, underscores the rarity and complexity of cortical deafness in the pediatric population.

The scoping review identified only 5 studies meeting the inclusion criteria, confirming the limited research on pediatric cortical deafness. The cases reviewed involved varied etiologies, including mitochondrial encephalopathy with lactic acidosis and strokelike episodes (MELAS) syndrome, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, bacterial meningitis, moyamoya disease, and viral meningoencephalitis. Despite the varied causes, a common feature was extensive bilateral lesions primarily affecting the superior temporal lobe, which includes the primary auditory cortex. This finding aligns with the presented case report, where bilateral strokes in the superior temporal gyrus resulted in cortical deafness.

In our clinical case, extensive instrumental assessments and a tailored visual-gestural intervention were critical in diagnosing and managing cortical deafness. To our knowledge, this is the first report of cortical deafness due to presumed perinatal brain injury in a girl with unilateral spastic cerebral palsy. Brain MRI conducted before the child's first year of life indicated the presence of bilateral strokes with asymmetrical extension. Both strokes affected the superior temporal gyrus, including the Heschl cortex, along with the primary sensorimotor cortex on the site contralateral to the observed hemiparesis. Although no specific triggering event was linked to the cerebrovascular event, we posit that it likely occurred either pre-perinatally or within the initial months of the child's life, suggesting a presumed perinatal stroke. The occurrence of bilateral strokes is relatively common, constituting 24% to 35% of perinatal strokes.

### The spectrum of abnormal neurologic outcomes subsequent to term intrapartum asphyxia [^113WeUuN]. Pediatric Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to describe the spectrum of possible abnormal neurologic outcomes in term infants with intrapartum asphyxia and to identify those clinical factors associated with the later occurrence of cerebral palsy. All children with term intrapartum asphyxia encountered in a single pediatric neurologic practice with at least 2 years of follow-up and an abnormal neurologic outcome were identified. Abnormal outcomes were grouped into those with or without cerebral palsy. A total of 40 children (28 male, 12 female) met study criteria. Of these, 23 developed cerebral palsy; the remaining 17 children developed an abnormal neurologic outcome that did not include cerebral palsy. A more severe grade of neonatal encephalopathy, a higher number of neonatal seizures, the neonatal use of phenytoin, diffuse abnormalities on imaging, and abnormal findings on neurologic examination at neonatal discharge were all significantly (P < 0.05) associated with an abnormal outcome that included cerebral palsy. Abnormal neurologic outcomes other than cerebral palsy subsequent to term intrapartum asphyxia may occur. It appears that a more severe grade of apparent initial clinical injury is more likely to result in an outcome featuring cerebral palsy.

### Characteristics of children with cerebral palsy in the post-therapeutic hypothermia era [^113Q1NDF]. Journal of Child Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives: To explore the profile of children with cerebral palsy secondary to intrapartum asphyxia treated with therapeutic hypothermia after birth and to compare characteristics of children treated with therapeutic hypothermia with mild vs severe cerebral palsy outcome. Study Design: We identified all children treated with therapeutic hypothermia for intrapartum asphyxia in a single-center tertiary-level neonatal intensive care unit from 2008 to 2018 with a cerebral palsy outcome. We collected perinatal and outcome measures from patient charts. We searched the literature for characteristics of children with cerebral palsy prior to therapeutic hypothermia (historical cohort) to compare to our cohort. We subdivided our cohort into mild vs severe cerebral palsy and compared neonatal characteristics to identify predictors of severe phenotype. Results: Thirty of 355 cooled neonates (8%) developed cerebral palsy. More children had spastic quadriparesis and epilepsy, and fewer had visual impairment in the post–therapeutic hypothermia era compared to the historical cohort, but had similar Gross Motor Function Classification System scores. In our cohort, more children had severe (19 of 30, 63%) compared to mild cerebral palsy (11 of 30, 37%). The severe group had higher mean birth weight, lower 5- and 10-minute Apgar scores, and more often white matter injury with associated deep gray matter injury or near-total injury pattern (P < .05). Conclusions: Our data demonstrated more infants with severe rather than mild cerebral palsy in our cohort treated with therapeutic hypothermia. Birthweight, 5- and 10-minute Apgar scores, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings were significantly different between mild and severe phenotype groups. Our findings can guide clinicians how to better weigh these factors, when counseling parents in the neonatal period.

### Outcome of non-cooled asphyxiated infants with under-recognised or delayed-onset encephalopathy [^113VbCcp]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To describe the clinical characteristics, MRI findings and neurodevelopmental outcome of infants with documented perinatal asphyxia and seizure onset within 24 hours after birth who were not selected for therapeutic hypothermia (TH).

Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Setting and Patients

(Near-)term infants with documented perinatal asphyxia referred to two Dutch level III neonatal units with neonatal encephalopathy (NE) and seizures < 24hours after birth not treated with TH. Infants with a diagnosis other than NE following perinatal asphyxia causing the seizures were excluded.

Main Outcome Measures

Clinical characteristics, findings on cranial MRI performed within 8days after birth and neurodevelopmental outcome assessed using the Griffiths Mental Development Scales at 18 months or Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development-Third Edition at 2 years of age.

Results

39 infants were included. All had abnormalities on MRI. Predominant white matter/watershed injury was the most common pattern of injury, 23 (59%). 7 (18%) infants had predominant basal ganglia/thalamus injury, 3 (8%) near total brain injury, 5 (13%) arterial ischaemic stroke, 1 (3%) an intraventricular haemorrhage. Adverse outcome was seen in 51%: 6 died, 11 developed cerebral palsy (spastic n = 8, dyskinetic n = 3), 2 had neurodevelopmental delay, 1 had severe hearing impairment.

Conclusions

All infants with documented perinatal asphyxia and seizure onset within 24 hours after birth who did not receive TH had abnormalities on MRI. 51% had an adverse outcome. Better methods for recognition of infants who might benefit from TH and careful neurodevelopmental follow-up are urgently needed.

### Magnetic resonance imaging in children with bilateral spastic forms of cerebral palsy [^115uJj3X]. Pediatric Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

We analyzed the relationship between magnetic resonance image findings in children with bilateral spastic cerebral palsy and its stages of severity in term and preterm children. Magnetic resonance image findings of 102 children (66 male and 36 female) with bilateral spastic cerebral palsy (median age, 2.5 years; range, 3 months to 15 years) were reevaluated. The study group consisted of children with confirmed perinatal asphyxia. Hypoxic-ischemic events were diagnosed in 64% of the children. Significant abnormalities relevant to cerebral palsy were evident on imaging in 85/102 (83%) children (in 77% of term and 93% of preterm children). Enlargement of the ventricles alone (48%) or accompanied by periventricular white-matter damage (25%) was the most frequent finding in term and preterm children, but was more highly expressed in preterm children (P < 0.05). White-matter damage was more often found in preterm children (P < 0.05). Enlargement of the lateral ventricles and periventricular leukomalacia may be attributable to ischemic damage to the neonatal brain. Significant correlations were found between magnetic resonance image findings and severity of cerebral palsy (P < 0.05). Detection of brain abnormalities in children with cerebral palsy may prove useful in prognoses as well as in medical consultations and management.

### Epidemiology of cerebral palsy in low-and middle-income countries: preliminary findings from an international multi-centre cerebral palsy register [^112Ctsnb]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Aim

To describe the epidemiology of cerebral palsy (CP) in children from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) using data from the Global Low- and Middle-Income Country CP register (GLM-CPR).

Method

The GLM-CPR is a multi-country initiative that combines and compares data from children with CP (< 18y) in LMICs. Children with CP are registered after detailed neurodevelopmental assessment by a multidisciplinary medical team using a harmonized protocol. Data are collected on agreed core variables. Descriptive analyses are completed to report findings from participating countries.

Results

Between January 2015 and May 2019, 2664 children were recruited from Bangladesh, Nepal, Indonesia, and Ghana (mean age [SD] at assessment: 7y 8mo [4y 8mo], 95% confidence interval 7y 6mo-7y 11mo; male [n = 1615] 60.6%, female [n = 1049] 39.4%). Overall, 86.6% children acquired CP prenatally and perinatally (e.g. preterm birth, birth asphyxia, neonatal encephalopathy). Median age at CP diagnosis was 3 years. Moreover, 79.2% children had spastic CP and 73.3% were classified in Gross Motor Function Classification System levels III to V. Notably, 47.3% of children never received rehabilitation services (median age at receiving rehabilitation services was 3y; 12.7% received assistive devices) and 75.6% of school-age children had no access to education.

Interpretation

Population-based data show that the proportion of severe cases of CP is very high in LMICs. Children with CP in LMICs lack access to rehabilitation and educational services and a large proportion of children have potentially preventable risk factors, for example, birth asphyxia and neonatal infections. Delayed diagnosis, severe motor impairments, and lack of rehabilitation in most children call for urgent action to identify preventive opportunities and promote early diagnosis and intervention for children with CP in LMICs. What this paper adds The proportion of severe cases of cerebral palsy (CP) is very high in rural low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Children with CP in LMICs lack access to rehabilitation and educational services. A large proportion of children with CP in LMICs have potentially preventable risk factors.

### Parasagittal lesions and ulegyria in hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy: neuroimaging findings and review of the pathogenesis [^113fXPDF]. Journal of Child Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Hypoxic-ischemic brain injury is a very important neurological problem of the perinatal period and a major cause of chronic disability later in childhood. The subsequent neurological deficits are a variety of motor defects-especially spasticity but also choreoathetosis, dystonia and ataxia, often grouped together as "cerebral palsy", mental retardation, and seizures. The gestational age determines the neuropathology of the brain injury. One of the patterns of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, typically affecting full-term infants, consists of parasagittal lesions and ulegyria. The aim of this study is to describe the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features and discuss the "suggested" pathogenetic mechanisms of this pattern, which affects the cortex and the white matter in a mainly parasagittal distribution; in this type of brain injury, the damage usually involves the deeper sulcal portion while sparing the apex, thus resulting in the so-called mushroom gyri characteristic ulegyric pattern. We discuss the MRI findings of parasagittal lesions and ulegyria in the brain examinations of 14 patients with a clinical history of perinatal hypoxia/anoxia presenting with mental retardation, seizures, and cerebral palsy. Differential diagnosis from polymicrogyria is discussed.

### Clinical phenotype of cerebral palsy depends on the cause: is It really cerebral palsy? A retrospective study [^117QmUEo]. Journal of Child Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Associations Between Cause and Clinical Phenotype

We further correlated the clinical phenotype, abnormalities during pregnancy, and delivery with the cause of cerebral palsy (Table 2 /). We found that children with cerebral palsy due to a genetic cause had higher GMFCS levels (P = 0.004) and more often presented with epilepsy (P = 0.04). Patients with cerebral palsy due to brain malformation had higher GMFCS levels significantly more often (P < .001), a dyskinetic cerebral palsy subtype (P = 0.03), lower birth weight percentiles (P = 0.02), epilepsy (P = 0.001), swallowing disorders (P = 0.002), hearing impairment (P = 0.007), hip dislocation (P = 0.009), scoliosis (P < .001), osteoporosis (P = 0.004), and pathological fractures (P = 0.02). In this subgroup of patients, unilateral spastic cerebral palsy (P = 0.01) and premature birth (P = 0.003) occurred less frequently. In children with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, we noted a higher GMFCS (P < .001), a larger proportion of children with dyskinetic cerebral palsy (P = 0.01), pathologic cardiotocography (P = 0.003), cardiac arrest (P = 0.006), emergency cesarean section (P < .001), fetal-to-neonatal maladaptation (P < .001), epilepsy (P = 0.03), swallowing disorders (P < .001), hip dislocation (P = 0.04), and hip dysplasia (P = 0.01). Rarer on the other hand were unilateral spastic cerebral palsy (P = 0.02) and spontaneous birth (P = 0.01). In patients with periventricular leukomalacia, cerebral palsy was diagnosed significantly earlier (P = 0.001) and the maternal age at delivery was higher (P = 0.02). Additionally, periventricular leukomalacia correlated with a higher number of cases with maternal smoking during pregnancy (P = 0.04), premature birth (P = 0.001), and hip dislocation (P = 0.02). Neonatal stroke was associated with early cerebral palsy diagnosis (P = 0.02), unilateral spastic cerebral palsy (P < .001), spontaneous birth (P = 0.02), and vacuum extraction (P = 0.001), whereas fewer cases were found with a higher GMFCS (P = 0.03), bilateral spastic cerebral palsy (P < .001), multiple birth (P = 0.009), premature birth (P < .001), primary cesarean section (P = 0.01), fetal-to-neonatal maladaptation (P < .001), visual defects (P = 0.01), and scoliosis (P = 0.004). In patients with intracerebral hemorrhage, unilateral spastic cerebral palsy (P < .001), multiple birth (P = 0.008), premature birth (P < .001), fetal-to-neonatal maladaptation (P = 0.001), and coagulation disorders (P = 0.002) were significantly more frequent. On the other hand, they less often had a high GMFCS (P = 0.03), bilateral spastic cerebral palsy (P = 0.006), consanguineous parents (P = 0.03), and vacuum extractions (P = 0.02). Children with hydrocephalus were more often part of multiple birth (P = 0.003), born prematurely (P < .001), had fetal-to-neonatal maladaptation (P < .001), epilepsy (P = 0.03), swallowing disorders (P = 0.02), visual defects (P < .001), and hip dislocations (P = 0.03). In the group of children with infections, bilateral spastic cerebral palsy (P < .01), premature birth (P < .001), fetal-to-neonatal maladaptation (P < .001), coagulation disorders (P = 0.001), acidosis (P = 0.02), and visual defects (P = 0.001) occurred more often.

### Hypothermia for perinatal asphyxia: trial-based resource use and costs at 6–7 years [^1168YN6o]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

A deficiency of oxygen at birth can result in injury to the neonatal brain. This neurological syndrome known as perinatal asphyxial encephalopathy can be characterised by the need for resuscitation, neurological depression and seizures, and is associated with a high risk of death or early neurodevelopmental impairment. Initiating moderate hypothermia soon after delivery for 72 hours has been shown to reduce the risk of death or disability at 18–24 months of age, and to increase the rate of survival without disability. Long-term follow-up of children in three major trials of hypothermia (the Total Body Hypothermia for Neonatal Encephalopathy (TOBY) trial, the CoolCap trial and the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) trial) has confirmed that the clinical benefit observed at 18 months persists or is maintained, at least in part, into middle childhood.

In addition to clinical data, the generation of data on the long-term cost impact of perinatal asphyxial encephalopathy and hypothermia is also crucial. Such data can provide clinicians and policy makers with vital information about the ongoing resources needed to provide care for survivors with disabilities of varying severities. Long-term cost data are also necessary inputs into cost-effectiveness analyses, which are paramount to ensure that scarce healthcare resources are appropriately invested in technologies that will realise most patient benefit. Indeed, cost-effectiveness analysis is now an integral part of the health technology appraisal process in many countries.

The short-term cost-effectiveness of hypothermia for perinatal asphyxial encephalopathy has been modelled by synthesising outcome data from the TOBY, CoolCap and NICHD trials and using data on healthcare costs to 18 months from TOBY. Acknowledging the long-term implications of the condition (which can include cerebral palsy, functional disability and cognitive impairment), the authors presented a sensitivity analysis in which the time horizon for the analysis was extended from 18 months to 18 years. In the absence of long-term data from neonatal encephalopathy survivors however, data on costs were taken from a cohort study of preterm infants and this was acknowledged as a limitation of the analysis.

To address this lack of long-term data and as part of the 6–7 years follow-up of surviving children in the TOBY trial, data were collected on children's healthcare resource use and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). The objectives of this substudy were to describe resource use and costs at 6–7 years in each trial arm and to quantify healthcare costs by overall disability level.

### Bilateral thalamic lesions in a newborn with intrauterine asphyxia after maternal cardiac arrest – a case report with literature review [^113UujiM]. Journal of Perinatology (2001). Low credibility.

Hypoxic-ischemic brain damage in preterm and term infants is one major cause of neonatal neurologic morbidity. Depending on the gestational age and the extent of hypoxia, different pathologic findings have been observed. Hypoxic-ischemic lesion of the thalamus is the least common form of cerebral injury. Although long-term outcome with spastic or extrapyramidal cerebral palsy is known, clinical features in the neonatal period are not well described. We report an infant with bilateral hypoxic-ischemic thalamic lesions after maternal cardiac arrest at 28 weeks of gestation. Clinical features and diagnostic results of our patient are compared to information given in the literature to define the clinical entity of hypoxic-ischemic thalamic lesions in neonates better.

### Application of criteria developed by the task force on neonatal encephalopathy and cerebral palsy to acutely asphyxiated neonates [^117PFDN1]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To estimate whether term neonates with acute intrapartum hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy and permanent brain injury satisfied the criteria for causation of cerebral palsy developed by the Task Force on Neonatal Encephalopathy and Cerebral Palsy.

Methods

In this descriptive study, patients in the case group were obtained from a registry of singleton, liveborn, term, neurologically impaired neonates. Entry criteria included a reactive intrapartum fetal heart rate pattern followed by a sudden, rapid, and sustained deterioration of the fetal heart rate that lasted until delivery and an umbilical artery cord pH. All patients in the case group were then assessed to determine if they met the criteria developed by the Task Force on Neonatal Encephalopathy and Cerebral Palsy.

Results

Thirty-nine neonates met the entry criteria, and the proportion meeting each essential criterion was as follows: 38 of 39 (97.4%) had umbilical artery pH of less than 7.00 and 30 of 30 (100%) had a base deficit of 12 mmol/L or higher; 33 of 34 (97%) had either moderate or severe encephalopathy; 34 of 36 (94%) had spastic quadriplegia or dyskinetic cerebral palsy or death attributable to brain injury; and 39 of 39 (100%) had no identifiable reason for exclusion.

Conclusion

Fetuses that underwent a sudden and sustained deterioration of the fetal heart rate and that subsequently were found to have cerebral palsy demonstrated characteristics consistent with criteria developed by the Task Force on Neonatal Encephalopathy and Cerebral Palsy for intrapartum asphyxial injury.

### Perinatal complications and socio-economic differences in cerebral palsy in Sweden-a national cohort study [^115yRYHi]. BMC Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Discussion

This study of a national cohort in Sweden demonstrates a considerable socio-economic gradient for cerebral palsy. Children in households with a low SES had a 50% higher risk than those in the highest SES category of being admitted to a hospital with a diagnosis of CP. Perinatal risk factors, particularly extreme preterm birth and asphyxia were associated with unspecified CP in this study. These indicators had a significant linear association with SES and seemed to mediate approximately 25% of the increased odds ratios associated with low SES.

The single most important perinatal risk factor in this study, accounting for two thirds of the variation associated with perinatal risk in Table 4, was gestational age. Several studies have linked preterm birth with the development of bilateral spastic diplegia through periventricular haemorrhage and leukomalaciae. Recent research with MRI have demonstrated that radiographic evidence of injuries in the immature brain is quite common in children with cerebral palsy born term with perinatal complications suggesting that perinatal events may easily be overestimated as causes of cerebral palsy. Thus, the estimates of the perinatal risk factors in this study may be an exaggeration of the true risk of cerebral palsy associated with perinatal complications.

An exaggerated role of perinatal factors as such may also create an exaggerated role of these factors as mediators for the influence of SES on CP. This and the considerable socio-economic risk not attributable to perinatal risk factors makes it necessary to look for alternative mediating pathways for this influence. These mechanisms could include infections, nutritional factors and other mechanisms during the pregnancy that may predispose the infant to hypoxia because of placental damage as well as factors related to the interaction with care in late pregnancy. The lack of a socio-economic gradient for children born preterm and small for date in this study, just as in the study of Dolk et al in the UK, however, seems to contradict hypotheses about diverse quality of neonatal care as a cause of socio-economic differences in cerebral palsy.

This study demonstrates a socio-economic gradient for cerebral palsy. A similar conclusion by Sundrum et al in a study population in west Sussex in the UK has been challenged by Pharoah because of their inclusion of children with severe head injuries and malformation syndromes as well children with unknown SES. In this study we have analysed these children separately, as suggested by Pharoah, thus giving indirect support to the conclusions made by Sundrum et al.

### Hypothermia for perinatal asphyxia: trial-based quality of life at 6–7 years [^112aPxpN]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2018). Low credibility.

Differences in attribute levels between trial arms were particularly pronounced for the speech domain (table 2), with 74% and 59% of parents in the hypothermia and control groups, respectively, reporting their child to be functioning at normal levels (level 1). Also apparent is that the proportions of children categorised as normal on the speech attribute are noticeably lower than the proportions categorised as normal on the other attributes, suggesting that in general, for these children, speech may be disproportionately affected as compared with other aspects of HRQL. A similar finding has been observed elsewhere. The NICHD follow-up study assessed various measures of intelligence for children 6–7 years after perinatal asphyxia and reported that verbal IQ scores generally showed greater deficits when compared with other measures such as performance IQ and processing speed quotients.

Despite a greater proportion of children in the control arm having moderate to severe disabilities and abnormal neurological functioning, 84% were still reported as being 'happy and interested in life' (level 1) on the HUI3 emotion attribute as compared with 85% in the hypothermia arm. The similarity of these figures suggests that the level of disability faced by these children may not necessarily impact on their ability to be happy. In the NICHD follow-up study, parents also reported on their child's emotional functioning at 6–7 years using the Child Health Questionnaire (CHQ). Similar proportions in the hypothermia and control arms (75% vs 76%) reported they were 'very satisfied' with their child's level of self-esteem. Published research in children with cerebral palsy has similarly shown emotional functioning appears to be unrelated to the severity of the condition. From parent-proxy responses on the HUI3, Kennes et al showed correspondingly high proportions of children reported as being 'happy and interested in life' across five cerebral palsy severity categories. These findings are notable and may help parents of babies with disabilities as a consequence of perinatal asphyxia, who may anticipate that their child will suffer in the longer term. One must however acknowledge that these findings come from parent-proxy responses rather than directly from the children per se.

### Temporal and demographic trends in cerebral palsy – fact and fiction [^115tVYgG]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

The rate of cerebral palsy has not decreased in developed countries over the past 30 years, despite the widespread use of electronic fetal heart rate monitoring and a 5-fold increase in the cesarean delivery rate over the same period of time. However, neonatal survival has improved during these decades. These observations have lead to the hypothesis that increased survival of premature, neurologically impaired infants may have masked an actual reduction in cerebral palsy among term infants as a result of the use of electronic monitoring and the avoidance of intrapartum asphyxia. A review of the medical literature, as well as a demographic analysis of term and preterm birth rates in the United States, refutes this hypothesis on four grounds. First, cerebral palsy prevalence has been separately analyzed in term infants and shows no change over 30 years. Second, the prevalence of cerebral palsy is the same or lower in underdeveloped countries than in developed nations; in the former, the availability of emergency cesarean delivery based on electronic monitor data is limited or absent. Third, the increase in prevalence of cerebral palsy among low-birth-weight infants and the increase in cesarean sections based on presumed fetal distress were not simultaneous events-the former preceded the latter by a decade. Improved neonatal survival since the 1980s has been associated with a stable or decreasing rate of neurologic impairment and thus could not have obscured improvement from reduced term asphyxia. Finally, compared with the number of infants born by cesarean section for fetal distress, there are simply not enough infants born in the most vulnerable weight groups to make any impact on even a minimal improvement of outcome in the group delivered by cesarean section for presumed fetal distress. Except in rare instances, cerebral palsy is a developmental event that is unpreventable given our current state of technology.

### Is perinatal asphyxia predictable? [^111H8uFx]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

We conducted a prospective observational cohort study between July 2014 and June 2016 from a network of four hospitals with different levels of care which shared protocols of intrapartum and neonatal care.

Inclusion criteria were asphyxiated neonates of gestational age ≥ 35 weeks, birthweight ≥ 1800 g, and no severe malformations. Perinatal asphyxia was defined as pH ≤ 7.0 or BE ≤ -12 mMol/L in UA or within 1 h, 10 min Apgar ≤ 5, or need for resuscitation > 10 min.

The network includes one Hub University Hospital center with a neonatal intensive care unit that offers therapeutic hypothermia, and three level I Community Hospital Spoke centers.

In Spoke centers, only women with low risk pregnancies or minor complications can be admitted for delivery. High risk pregnancies for medical or fetal complications are referred to Hub. Patients with low risk pregnancies may choose to deliver in either Spoke or Hub centers.

### Ante-and perinatal factors for cerebral palsy: case-control study in Estonia [^117A6Vfc]. Journal of Child Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

Establishing consistency between cerebral palsy registries in reporting of new cases enables more effective collaboration in terms of researching predisposing factors. To identify antenatal and intrapartum risk factors for cerebral palsy in the Estonian population, we undertook a matched case-control study of 153 children with cerebral palsy, ascertained from a population-based survey. One hundred two maternal, antenatal, and intrapartum variables were initially retrieved from medical records. Main outcome measures were the odds ratio estimates of relative risk of cerebral palsy. As a result of the study, and considering the whole spectrum of severity, the relevant risk factors during pregnancy were bleeding after 20 weeks, anemia in the second half of pregnancy, pregnancy-induced hypertension in the second half of pregnancy, and preeclampsia. The most important intrapartum factors were premature birth, placental abruption, an acute hypoxic event during delivery, and any fetal presentation other than vertex. Predisposing factors related to neonatal condition were an Apgar score ≤ 7 at the first and fifth minutes of life, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, and assisted ventilation. Our findings suggest that intrapartum factors, including those hypothetically realized through hypoxic-ischemic pathways, are not of low importance in the etiology of cerebral palsy.

### Five and 10 minute APGAR scores and risks of cerebral palsy and epilepsy: population based cohort study in Sweden [^115gkVJv]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Potential mechanisms

Cerebral palsy and childhood onset epilepsy are serious neurological disorders associated with increased risks of morbidity and mortality. The causes of cerebral palsy and epilepsy are multifactorial, but prenatal and perinatal events are important risk factors for both conditions. Cerebral palsy is commonly referred to as an umbrella diagnosis with reference to cause, severity, and symptoms. Awareness of the importance of an early diagnosis of cerebral palsy is increasing given that cerebral palsy can often be diagnosed before 5 months of age. Early identification of cerebral palsy and active intervention may alter neuroplasticity and optimise the child's psychomotor development. Seventy per cent of children with cerebral palsy are born at term, and the cause of cerebral palsy differs between preterm and term infants. Data from animal studies suggest that brain injury secondary to ischaemia/hypoxia is a more prevalent cause of cerebral palsy in term children than in preterm children. Hypoxia may lead to energy depletion, oxidative stress, and inflammation, ultimately resulting in cell death. However, a comprehensive review by Ellenberg and Nelson states that only a small proportion of all cases of cerebral palsy are due to perinatal asphyxia. Reduced vitality in term born infants has a variety of potential causes with clinically similar manifestations. For example, maternal fever and inflammatory conditions are common antecedents of low Apgar scores, depressed respiration, and other symptoms that are also common in hypoxia. Thus, other adverse prenatal or perinatal events, equally deleterious to the developing brain, including inflammation in the maternal/fetal compartments, may have contributed to our findings. Nevertheless, in our study of children born at term, perinatal hypoxia may be one of the underlying factors that contributed to the increased risks of cerebral palsy among infants with lower Apgar scores.

### Hemiplegic (unilateral) cerebral palsy in Northern stockholm: clinical assessment, brain imaging, EEG, epilepsy and aetiologic background factors [^114AWY47]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Less than 50% of the eligible subjects participated, which may have biased the results. Probably the children with most problems, consented to participate. This may be due to the sparse attention, which is offered in routine health care follow up.

In agreement with many other studies, 70% of the participants in this study were male.

In Stockholm, Sweden, only children included in the high risk group are considered for special follow up by a neonatologist or neurologist. This high risk group encompasses major perinatal risk factors such as asphyxia, neonatal seizures, cerebral haemorraghe, hypoxic- ischaemic encephalopathy, sepsis etc. leading to care in the neonatal unit. Birth before 28 weeks´ gestation and/ or children being small for gestational age are also included in the high risk group. Children without major perinatal risk factors will be examined by a general practitioner at the child health center.

Most patients with cerebral palsy are born at term. In this study, term children comprised 70%. In "A systematic review of risk factors for cerebral palsy in children born at term in developed countries", McIntyre found ten consistent risk factors for cerebral palsy in term children: Placental abnormalities, major and minor birth defects, low birth weight, meconium aspiration, instrumental/ emergency caesarean delivery, birth asphyxia, neonatal seizures, respiratory distress syndrome, hypoglycaemia and neonatal infection. However, other risk factors such as maternal disease or being large for gestational age were not statistically significant. But these risk factors may work together along a causal pathway. Thirteen of the sixteen term children had consistent risk factors for cerebral palsy, according to McIntyre. Three of them had minor risk factors, such as rapid parturition and prolonged labor, see Table 1 clinical presentation. In all only five of the 21 children had no pre-, peri- or postnatal risk factors for cerebral palsy.

### Association of cerebral palsy with APGAR score in low and normal birthweight infants: population based cohort study [^116cGNMC]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

Principal findings

In this population based cohort study, low Apgar score 5 minutes after birth was strongly associated with later diagnosis of cerebral palsy. The prevalence of cerebral palsy in children with Apgar score of less than 3 was more than 130-fold higher than in children with Apgar score of 10. Also, in children of low birth weight, low Apgar score was significantly associated with increased risk of cerebral palsy, although this relation was less pronounced. In children with Apgar score of less than 4, between 10% and 17% in all birthweight groups were diagnosed with cerebral palsy. The association between Apgar score and cerebral palsy was seen for all subgroups of spastic cerebral palsy, but the strength of the association was strongest for quadriplegia.

Interpretation of the findings

Given that Apgar score is a measure of vitality shortly after birth, our findings suggest that the causes of cerebral palsy are closely linked to factors that reduce infant vitality. Low Apgar score was previously regarded as a sign of perinatal asphyxia, but is now considered of limited value for diagnosing asphyxia. In addition, low Apgar score has been shown to predict infant death far better than low pH in the umbilical artery. Hence, factors other than infant asphyxia may be associated with Apgar score and, therefore, with cerebral palsy. Low Apgar score is also linked to immaturity, malformations, and impairments of the central nervous system. In fact, low Apgar score might be interpreted as an indicator of brain impairment that has occurred in utero or during delivery. Such interpretation of Apgar score implies that all children with a low Apgar score have a similar risk of cerebral palsy independent of birth weight, which is in accordance with our results. Low Apgar score might, therefore, be considered a marker of underlying causal factors of cerebral palsy. Knowledge of the association of Apgar score with cerebral palsy within subgroups of children could be important in the search for causes.

### Neonatal interventions for preventing cerebral palsy: an overview of cochrane systematic reviews [^115QaxWN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Cerebral palsy is an umbrella term that encompasses disorders of movement and posture attributed to non-progressive disturbances occurring in the developing foetal or infant brain. As there are diverse risk factors and aetiologies, no one strategy will prevent cerebral palsy. Therefore, there is a need to systematically consider all potentially relevant interventions for prevention.

Objectives

PrimaryTo summarise the evidence from Cochrane Systematic Reviews regarding effects of neonatal interventions for preventing cerebral palsy (reducing cerebral palsy risk). SecondaryTo summarise the evidence from Cochrane Systematic Reviews regarding effects of neonatal interventions that may increase cerebral palsy risk.

Methods

We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (27 November 2016) for reviews of neonatal interventions reporting on cerebral palsy. Two review authors assessed reviews for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed review quality (using AMSTAR and ROBIS) and quality of the evidence (using the GRADE approach). Reviews were organised by topic; findings were summarised in text and were tabulated. Interventions were categorised as effective (high-quality evidence of effectiveness); possibly effective (moderate-quality evidence of effectiveness); ineffective (high-quality evidence of harm); probably ineffective (moderate-quality evidence of harm or lack of effectiveness); and no conclusions possible (low- to very low-quality evidence).

Main Results

Forty-three Cochrane Reviews were included. A further 102 reviews pre-specified the outcome cerebral palsy, but none of the included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) reported this outcome. Included reviews were generally of high quality and had low risk of bias, as determined by AMSTAR and ROBIS. These reviews involved 454 RCTs; data for cerebral palsy were available from 96 (21%) RCTs involving 15,885 children. Review authors considered interventions for neonates with perinatal asphyxia or with evidence of neonatal encephalopathy (3); interventions for neonates born preterm and/or at low or very low birthweight (33); and interventions for other specific groups of 'at risk' neonates (7). Quality of evidence (GRADE) ranged from very low to high. Interventions for neonates with perinatal asphyxia or with evidence of neonatal encephalopathyEffective interventions: high-quality evidence of effectivenessResearchers found a reduction in cerebral palsy following therapeutic hypothermia versus standard care for newborns with hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (risk ratio (RR) 0.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54 to 0.82; seven trials; 881 children). No conclusions possible: very low-quality evidenceOne review observed no clear differences in cerebral palsy following therapeutic hypothermia versus standard care. Interventions for neonates born preterm and/or at low or very low birthweightPossibly effective interventions: moderate-quality evidence of effectivenessResearchers found a reduction in cerebral palsy with prophylactic methylxanthines (caffeine) versus placebo for endotracheal extubation in preterm infants (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.92; one trial; 644 children). Probably ineffective interventions: moderate-quality evidence of harmResearchers reported an increase in cerebral palsy (RR 1.45, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.98; 12 trials; 1452 children) and cerebral palsy in assessed survivors (RR 1.50, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.00; 12 trials; 959 children) following early (at less than eight days of age) postnatal corticosteroids versus placebo or no treatment for preventing chronic lung disease in preterm infants. Probably ineffective interventions: moderate-quality evidence of lack of effectivenessTrial results showed no clear differences in cerebral palsy following ethamsylate versus placebo for prevention of morbidity and mortality in preterm or very low birthweight infants (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.64 to 2.00; three trials, 532 children); volume expansion versus no treatment (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.20; one trial; 604 children); gelatin versus fresh frozen plasma (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.69; one trial, 399 children) for prevention of morbidity and mortality in very preterm infants; prophylactic indomethacin versus placebo for preventing mortality and morbidity in preterm infants (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.40; four trials; 1372 children); synthetic surfactant versus placebo for respiratory distress syndrome in preterm infants (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.05; five trials; 1557 children); or prophylactic phototherapy versus standard care (starting phototherapy when serum bilirubin reached a pre-specified level) for preventing jaundice in preterm or low birthweight infants (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.85; two trials; 756 children). No conclusions possible: low- to very low-quality evidenceNo clear differences in cerebral palsy were observed with interventions assessed in 21 reviews. Interventions for other specific groups of 'at risk' neonatesNo conclusions possible: low- to very low-quality evidenceReview authors observed no clear differences in cerebral palsy with interventions assessed in five reviews.

Authors' Conclusions

This overview summarises evidence from Cochrane Systematic Reviews regarding effects of neonatal interventions on cerebral palsy, and can be used by researchers, funding bodies, policy makers, clinicians, and consumers to aid decision-making and evidence translation. To formally assess other benefits and/or harms of included interventions, including impact on risk factors for cerebral palsy, review of the included Reviews is recommended. Therapeutic hypothermia versus standard care for newborns with hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy can prevent cerebral palsy, and prophylactic methylxanthines (caffeine) versus placebo for endotracheal extubation in preterm infants may reduce cerebral palsy risk. Early (at less than eight days of age) postnatal corticosteroids versus placebo or no treatment for preventing chronic lung disease in preterm infants may increase cerebral palsy risk. Cerebral palsy is rarely identified at birth, has diverse risk factors and aetiologies, and is diagnosed in approximately one in 500 children. To date, only a small proportion of Cochrane Systematic Reviews assessing neonatal interventions have been able to report on this outcome. There is an urgent need for long-term follow-up of RCTs of such interventions addressing risk factors for cerebral palsy (through strategies such as data linkage with registries) and for consideration of the use of relatively new interim assessments (including the General Movements Assessment). Such RCTs must be rigorous in their design and must aim for consistency in cerebral palsy outcome measurement and reporting to facilitate pooling of data and thus to maximise research efforts focused on prevention.

### Cerebral palsy characteristics in term-born children with and without detectable perinatal risk factors: a cross-sectional study [^114XuENt]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

We found that participants in the CCPR born at term with 'undetectable' neonatal risk were more likely to have unilateral CP and focal injury on MRI, particularly venous stroke, than those with perinatal risk factors and/or symptoms, and they had a lower degree of impairments as measured by the GMFCS and were more likely to communicate with words. Contrary to our hypothesis, the 'undetectable' group did not have more postneonatal causes of CP.

The lack of neonatal symptoms and risk factors in the 'undetectable' group may reflect an early, antenatal timing of disruption to the central nervous system leading to CP. In this study, 28% of participants had encephalopathy or seizures, which is similar to other studies. There has been speculation that the absence of documented neonatal symptoms in some children with CP represents encephalopathy that has been 'missed' and could have benefited from interventions such as therapeutic hypothermia. Contrary to that hypothesis, the HEAL Trial has shown that subacute injuries (> 7–10 days, on the basis of the absence of diffusion restriction)can be associated with 'mild' encephalopathy, which suggests previous injury to the brain allowing for some resolution of encephalopathy before delivery. This conclusion is further supported by high rates of MRI abnormalities in infants with mild encephalopathy, and a recent study from the CCPR that found that 17% of participants with MRI patterns of hypoxia–ischemia did not have documented neonatal encephalopathy (nor postneonatal injury). Postneonatal brain injury in the CCPR includes infection, trauma, medical intervention, stroke, hypoxia (near‐drowning or near‐sudden infant death syndrome), and miscellaneous, and contrary to our hypothesis was found in approximately 9% of participants in both groups, which is similar to other studies reporting 6% to 8%. Genetic conditions are another important cause of CP that may be asymptomatic at birth, which are considered to account for 7% to 30% of CP. The characteristics of children with genetic causes of CP include those with intellectual disability, born at term, with a normal MRI, or non‐stroke MRI abnormalities. Children without detectable risk factors have a higher prevalence of genetic causes for their CP.

### A comparison of spastic diplegic and tetraplegic cerebral palsy [^11234dti]. Pediatric Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to compare spastic diplegic and tetraplegic cerebral palsy. Thirty-eight children had spastic diplegic cerebral palsy and 48 spastic tetraplegic cerebral palsy. Risk factors of cerebral palsy, seizures, severity of cerebral palsy, electroencephalogram, and magnetic resonance imaging findings were analyzed. Gestational history, low birth weight, and perinatal pathologies were present in similar percentages in both groups. Lower values of the Apgar score were recorded more often in the tetraplegic cerebral palsy group than the diplegic group. The children with spastic diplegia were classified more frequently into levels I and II of the Gross Motor Function Classification System, but patients with spastic tetraplegia were classified more frequently into levels IV and V. Similarly, mental retardation was observed more frequently in the patients with spastic tetraplegia. In magnetic resonance imaging, periventricular leukomalacia was detected in a higher proportion of children with spastic diplegia than in patients with tetraplegia. Cerebral atrophy occurred more frequently in the tetraplegic group compared with diplegic patients. Twenty-four (50.0%) children with spastic tetraplegia had epilepsy compared with six children with spastic diplegia. The incidence of intractable epilepsy was higher in the tetraplegic patients than in the children with spastic diplegia.

### Severe agitation in a teenager with spastic cerebral palsy: a clinical challenge [^1163Ceu1]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is a challenging diagnosis because it mimics many other conditions. We present a case of a 16-year-old boy with spastic cerebral palsy who presented with severe agitation, hyperthermia, and autonomic dysfunction. He arrived to a community pediatric hospital without a caregiver to provide a detailed history, which further complicated his management.

### Hospital-based surveillance of children with cerebral palsy in Suriname: the Suriname cerebral palsy register [^116hWHAG]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Aim

To describe the aetiological risk factors, clinical characteristics, access to rehabilitation, and educational status of children with cerebral palsy (CP) in Suriname.

Method

Hospital-based surveillance of children with CP aged younger than 18years was conducted at the Academic Hospital Paramaribo, Suriname (known as the Suriname CP Register [SUR-CPR]). Data were collected on sociodemographic characteristics, aetiological risk factors, clinical characteristics, rehabilitation, and educational status. Registry data on aetiological risk factors were compared with available national prevalence rates in Suriname. Descriptive statistics were reported.

Results

Between August 2018 and March 2020, 82 children with CP (mean [SD] age 5years 10 months [3years 10 months]) attending the Academic Hospital Paramaribo were registered in the SUR-CPR. The mean (SD) age at diagnosis was 5years 5months (4years 1month). Spastic CP was predominant in 90.8% of children and 58.8% were classified in Gross Motor Function Classification System levels III to V. Overall, 43.9% had preterm birth compared with 13.9% reported nationally (p < 0.001) and 61.6% had birth-related complications compared with 15% reported nationally (p < 0.001). Additionally, 39.1% had birth asphyxia and 23.2% had early feeding difficulties. Sixty-two percent were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit, 54.0% of whom required ventilation. Most children (82.5%) had CP acquired pre- or perinatally and 17.5% had CP acquired postneonatally. Seventeen percent had never received any rehabilitation services, and 31.9% of the school-aged children were not enrolled in any education system.

Interpretation

The high burden of known aetiological risk factors, delayed diagnosis, and severe functional impairment among children with CP registered at the Academic Hospital Paramaribo is concerning. Public health interventions targeting early diagnosis and early intervention could improve the functional outcome of children with CP in Suriname.

What This Paper Adds

Almost half of the children with cerebral palsy (CP) had preterm birth, low birthweight, and signs of birth asphyxia. Most of the children were diagnosed after 5years of age. Overall, 52.5% of children had severe forms of CP of whom only 36.6% received any assistive devices.

### Hemiplegic (unilateral) cerebral palsy in Northern stockholm: clinical assessment, brain imaging, EEG, epilepsy and aetiologic background factors [^1168ZTDu]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinical assessment

All case records were reviewed with particular attention to pathogenic factors and pre-peri- or postnatal risk factors for cerebral palsy (18). Common perinatal risk factors are neonatal seizures, asphyxia and cerebral infection. Postnatal head trauma or surgery are important postnatal risk factors. Prenatal risk factors were defined as described by McIntyre. The results of visual- and audition testing were collected. All of the children were examined by the same paediatric neurologist (ET). Parents´ occupation was documented.

Case history included information about gestation, birth-weight, perinatal events, developmental milestones, debut of clinical signs and age at diagnosis. Special focus was laid on early handedness, ie impaired hand function on one side, or delayed or abnormal walking. The neurological examination, as in a previous study, consisted of assessment of the cranial nerves, head circumference, muscle tone, motor impairment, tendons reflexes, the Babinski response. Speech was evaluated according to Andersen: Zero indicates normal speech, one indistinct speech, two obviously indistinct speech, three severely indistinct speech, and four no speech.

The results of computerized tomography (CT)-scans and or magnetic imaging (MRI) of the brain were collected. For describing the brain morphology revealed by brain imaging we used the classification proposed by Reid. The imaging patterns include white matter injury, grey matter injury, focal vascular insults and malformations. Most studies report only the predominant radiologic alteration. In this study we tried to describe the different radiologic abnormalities in each child. All available MRI's and or CT-scans of the brain, were collected and reviewed by the same experienced radiologist.

Epilepsy was diagnosed according to ICD, by the paediatric neurologist at the Karolinska University Hospital, before study comenced. Epilepsy was classified according to the latest criteria of the International league against epilepsy, 2017. Focal seizures with or without secondary generalization were categorized in the same subtype. Electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded according to the 10–20 system, 20 min´ registration with alert patient. All EEG: s from the study and earlier EEG:s from the case records, were viewed by an experienced neurophysiologist (JP) together with the paediatric neurologist (ET).

All participants were offered a cytomegalovirus DNA assessment in their neonatal screening card.

### Holistic care of complicated tuberculosis in healthcare settings with limited resources [^116Lzf7n]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2017). Low credibility.

CNS tuberculosis

Clinical presentation, history, examination and investigations

The clinical presentation of CNS TB varies, including meningitis, seizures and acute encephalopathy, raised intracranial pressure which may manifest as chronic headaches, visual disturbances, cranial nerve palsies, focal motor deficits such as hemiplegia or hemiparesis, hydrocephalus, movement disorders including dystonia, coma and progressive loss of developmental milestones. Raised intracranial pressure in TB may result from the space-occupying nature of a tubercular granuloma, brain oedema, cerebral infarction, venous thrombosis or hydrocephalus. The manifestations of CNS TB overlap with other diagnoses, including CNS tumours, stroke, viral encephalitis, HIV encephalopathy, cryptococcal meningitis and postinfectious inflammatory encephalopathies such as acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. In settings with limited diagnostic capacity, many children with acute or subacute febrile encephalopathy or elevated intracranial pressure are empirically treated as tuberculous meningitis (TBM) because of failure to improve after antibiotic treatment for bacterial meningitis, or because their history suggests exposure to infectious TB. This is a practical approach and sometimes the only safe course of action.

including being very clear about the onset of illness and what the child was like developmentally before becoming unwell. Sometimes the onset is obvious and the demarcation between the child's normal state and sickness is clear, but often it is necessary to ask probing questions about the attaining of normal developmental milestones in the months preceding the onset of illness. For example, an infant who at 6 months was able to sit unaided and smile and laugh, but now at 8 months has decreased conscious state, wasting and spasticity indicates a recent deterioration in neurological state, which favours a subacute encephalopathy such as CNS TB as a diagnosis over cerebral palsy of perinatal origin.

Diagnostic specificity is also enhanced by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination, with moderate-to-high lymphocyte count (100–1000 cells/microlitre) and protein (100–500 mg/dL). If available, acid-fast bacilli staining, culture and GeneXpert MTB/Rif testing of CSF can increase specificity. However, the ideal volume of CSF needed to do these tests is 6–8 mL, and the CSF should be centrifuged to test the supernatant. Sensitivity is low so no laboratory test on CSF can exclude TBM.

### Genetic investigations in cerebral palsy [^113LQQKL]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

The initial description of neurodevelopmental symptoms that later become known as CP is ascribed to William John Little in 1861. His seminal paper, 'On the influence of abnormal parturition, difficult labour, premature birth, and asphyxia neonatorum on the mental and physical condition of the child, especially in relation to deformities', published in the Transactions of the Obstetrical Society of London, led to recognition that adverse conditions in the perinatal and neonatal period can result in neurodevelopmental delay and motor impairment.

CP, as defined by Rosenbaum et al. describes 'a group of permanent disorders of the development of movement and posture, causing activity limitation… attributed to non‐progressive disturbances… in the developing fetal or infant brain. The motor disorders of CP are often accompanied by disturbances of sensation, perception, cognition, communication, and behaviour; by epilepsy, and by secondary musculoskeletal disorders'. The term is descriptive not aetiological and stands even if an underlying aetiology (genetic or otherwise) is subsequently found. This definition is subject to current scrutiny and potential revision, with inclusion of the views of those affected.

It is well recognized that maldevelopment or injury/insult to the developing brain in utero or as a neonate or infant (e.g. perinatal complications of placental abruption and disruption of neonatal circulation leading to hypoxic–ischaemic encephalopathy [HIE]) can lead to CP. In the 1960s the specialties of obstetrics and neonatology helped decrease rates of CP through advances in care including more effective infant resuscitation. Associated with new expertise came the practice of resuscitating infants born preterm at younger ages (22 weeks' gestation in many centres). While rates of CP in high‐income European countries and Australia have fallen, the birth prevalence remains high in low‐ and middle‐income countries. Birth prevalence of CP in high‐income countries is estimated as 1.6 per 1000 live births but is over twofold greater in some low‐ and middle‐income countries.

### Long-term developmental outcome of asphyxiated term neonates [^113v9Y1k]. Journal of Child Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

Asphyxia remains one of the main causes of later disability in term infants. Despite many publications identifying possible predictors of outcome in this population of interest, little is known of the long-term developmental outcome of asphyxiated term neonates. Observational studies have largely focused on short-term outcomes, with an emphasis on significant neurologic sequelae and intellectual impairments. This article reviews the literature that has described the developmental outcome of asphyxiated term newborns. As part of this review, we have also highlighted the evolution of the definition of asphyxia and delineated appropriate markers that should be used in future research on this population.

### A systematic review of risk factors for cerebral palsy in children born at term in developed countries [^1123LhBx]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Aim

The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review in order to identify the risk factors for cerebral palsy (CP) in children born at term. The secondary aim was to ascertain if the potential for prevention of these risk factors has been adequately explored.

Method

A MEDLINE search up to 31 July 2011 was completed, following the Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines. Publications were reviewed to identify those with both a primary aim of identifying risk factors for all children or term-born children with CP and a cohort or case-control study design. Studies were examined for potential chance or systematic bias. The range of point estimates of relative risk is reported.

Results

From 21 articles meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria and at low risk of bias, data from 6297 children with CP and 3804791 children without CP were extracted. Ten risk factors for term-born infants were statistically significant in each study: placental abnormalities, major and minor birth defects, low birthweight, meconium aspiration, instrumental/emergency Caesarean delivery, birth asphyxia, neonatal seizures, respiratory distress syndrome, hypoglycaemia, and neonatal infections. Strategies for possible prevention currently exist for three of these.

Interpretation

Ten consistent risk factors have been identified, some with potential for prevention. Efforts to prevent these risk factors to interrupt the pathway to CP should be extended.

### Admissions and outcomes after perinatal asphyxia and hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy before and after therapeutic hypothermia: a retrospective population-based study [^114Bs5vG]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Perinatal asphyxia and hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE) continue to be among the primary causes of neonatal morbidity and mortality globally. Therapeutic hypothermia (TH) has been found to improve outcomes for infants with moderate and severe HIE and was introduced in clinical practice around the world between 2007 and 2010. The latest Cochrane review reported death or major disability at 18–24 months in 46% of cooled and 61% of non-cooled infants, hence a 25% relative risk reduction with cooling. A more recent randomised controlled trial (RCT) reported an even lower rate (29%) of adverse outcomes among cooled infants.

Therapeutic hypothermia has a short therapeutic window and has, therefore, made it essential to classify the severity of HIE as soon as possible and, at the latest, within 6 hours of age. However, the HIE staging used in clinical practice was not designed to identify moderate/severe HIE during the first few postnatal hours. A correct diagnosis of perinatal asphyxia and HIE is also difficult due to the lack of uniform and objective definitions. Population-based studies on the incidence and outcomes after assumed perinatal asphyxia and HIE often rely on one or only a few proxy variables, such as Apgar scores, cord blood pH or provision of TH. Both Apgar and cord pH have poor sensitivity and specificity for adverse childhood outcomes. Incidence rates of moderate/severe HIE based on the provision of TH alone will be inaccurate. Infants with mild HIE are increasingly being cooled, and a significant number of infants with moderate/severe HIE are, for various reasons, not cooled. To accurately monitor the clinical significance of perinatal hypoxia/ischaemia severe enough to necessitate admission for neonatal care, its treatment and its consequences, studies with access to detailed individual data are needed.

We studied admissions related to perinatal asphyxia/HIE to a Norwegian tertiary-level neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) from 2003 to 2011 and collected data on survival without cerebral palsy (CP) at 9–10 years of age. The aim was to provide population-based temporal trends in admissions and outcomes before and after the implementation of TH in June 2007.

### Incidence of neonatal asphyxia and associated risk factors: a systematic review and cumulative meta-analysis [^1168W87K]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Although the primary risk factors examined in this study have been reported in some previous literature, our research encompasses a broader time span, incorporating the latest multi-regional studies published up to 2023. By employing a cumulative meta-analysis approach, we reveal temporal trends in incidence and associated risk factors, which distinguishes our work from the static perspective of traditional meta-analyses. Furthermore, this study includes data from multiple countries across Asia, Africa, the Americas, and Europe, thereby effectively addressing the limitation of the limited geographical coverage in prior research. This study conducted a meta-analysis based on 18 observational studies to assess the incidence and associated risk factors of neonatal asphyxia, providing evidence for targeted prevention and intervention strategies. The pooled incidence of neonatal asphyxia was 1.07% (95% CI: 1.05–1.09), which is largely consistent with previously reported data. The results exhibited substantial heterogeneity. Subgroup analysis and meta-regression based on diagnostic criteria revealed that the criteria were not a significant source of this heterogeneity. Cumulative meta-analysis indicated an increasing trend in the incidence of birth asphyxia over time, which may be associated with the recent inclusion of more studies from high-incidence regions such as Ethiopia, where the incidence can be as high as 19.4%. However, considerable variation in the incidence of birth asphyxia was observed across the included studies (0.92%–27.1%), which may be related to disparities in healthcare standards among different regions. Developed countries may have better postnatal asphyxia screening strategies and management of idiopathic etiologies, contributing to reduced incidence, mortality, and associated complications of neonatal asphyxia. In developing countries, neonatal asphyxia remains a major cause of illness and death among newborns. Perinatal hypoxic events — including maternal/fetal hemorrhage, umbilical cord compression, uterine rupture, or shoulder dystocia — compromise oxygenated blood supply to the fetus. Such hypoxic-ischemic insults can induce multi-organ damage and significantly contribute to global neonatal morbidity and mortality. In most cases, the infant successfully recovers from the hypoxic episode, however, some patients may develop ischemic brain damage leading to permanent neurological diseases such as seizures, cerebral palsy, cognitive delays and motor disorders. Therefore, this study conducted subgroup analyses by dividing the participants into four groups based on geographic regions: Europe, Asia, the Americas, and Africa. The results revealed significant heterogeneity among the groups (P = 0.05), indicating notable differences in incidence rates across regions. This may reflect disparities in healthcare resources, obstetric management, socioeconomic conditions, and environmental factors among regions, which significantly influence the incidence of neonatal asphyxia. Thus, the overall pooled incidence rate of this study should be interpreted cautiously in conjunction with regional characteristics. The findings underscore the need for additional region-specific studies to enhance understanding of neonatal asphyxia, which is crucial for accurately identifying risk factors and implementing effective prevention and early intervention strategies.

The results of this study provide further evidence characterizing how bilateral CP is likely to develop with age. Our data provide baseline natural history information, against which the results of interventions can be compared. It is hoped that this will inform future research assessing outcomes. It will also guide decision‐making in the management of this condition.

### Association of cerebral palsy with other disabilities in children with perinatal arterial ischemic stroke [^114wiJYp]. Pediatric Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

The association of cerebral palsy with other disabilities in children with perinatal stroke has not been well-studied. We examined this association in 111 children with perinatal stroke: 67 with neonatal presentation, and 44 with delayed presentation. Seventy-six children (68%) had cerebral palsy, which was hemiplegic in 66 and tri- or quadriplegic in 10. Fifty-five (72%) children with cerebral palsy had at least one other disability: 45 (59%) had a cognitive/speech impairment (moderate-severe in 20), and 36 (47%) had epilepsy (moderate-severe in 11). In children with neonatal presentation, cerebral palsy was associated with epilepsy (P = 0.0076) and cognitive impairment (P = 0.0001). These associations could not be tested in children with delayed presentation because almost all children in this group had cerebral palsy. In another analysis with multivariate logistic regression for children with cerebral palsy, children who had both neonatal presentation and history of cesarean-section delivery were more likely to have epilepsy (P = 0.001). Children with cerebral palsy after perinatal stroke who had neonatal presentation were more likely to have severe cognitive impairment (odds ratio, 7.78; 95% confidence interval, 1.80–47.32) or severe epilepsy (odds ratio, 6.64; 95% confidence interval, 1.21–69.21) than children with delayed presentation. Children with cerebral palsy after perinatal stroke are likely to have an additional disability; those with neonatal presentation are more likely to have a severe disability.

### A case report of peroneal muscle atrophy type 2A2 with central nervous system involvement as initial presentation [^113UGCfe]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Medical records

A 3-year and 5-month-old girl presented to Children's Hospital Affiliated to Nanjing Medical University in October 2019 because of "motor backwardness, muscle tension and abnormal gait for more than 1 year". Since childhood, the child suffered from motor developmental delay and was still unstable in walking alone at the age of 2 years old, accompanied by increased muscle tension in the left limb and inflexibility in the left limb when walking alone. As a result, "cerebral palsy (left hemiplegia)" was locally diagnosed and rehabilitation therapy was intermittently performed. When she was 3 years and 2 months old, she experienced motor dysfunction, manifested as right limb movement disorder, and she could not stand or walk alone. When the girl was helped to walk, she had hip flexion, knee abduction, and sharp enough, as well as mild internal rotation and varus of the foot, with high foot arch. Her language and cognition were also backward, and she can only send the single-character sound of "Dad and Mom", and complete simple instructions. The patient was G4P2, and underwent cesarean section at term due to "oligohydramnios". Her birth weight was 3500g, Apgar score was unknown, and she denied any rescue history of asphyxia. She had been insured during the first trimester of mother's pregnancy, but there was nothing special about the rest. She had two previous history of "febrile convulsions". Her parents were healthy, non-consanguineous and had a 7-year-old sister with normal athletic and intellectual development, who denied any similar medical history in her family.

### Structural and perfusion abnormalities of brain on MRI and technetium-99m-ECD SPECT in children with cerebral palsy: a comparative study [^113hNciy]. Journal of Child Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Cerebral palsy has traditionally been associated with hypoxic ischemic brain damage. This study was undertaken to demonstrate structural and perfusion brain abnormalities. Fifty-six children diagnosed clinically as having cerebral palsy were studied between 1 to 14 years of age and were subjected to 3 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Brain and Technetium-99m-ECD brain single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scan. Male to female ratio was 1.8:1 with a mean age of 4.16 ± 2.274 years. Spastic cerebral palsy was the most common type, observed in 91%. Birth asphyxia was the most common etiology (69.6%). White matter changes (73.2%) such as periventricular leukomalacia and corpus callosal thinning were the most common findings on MRI. On SPECT all cases except one revealed perfusion impairments in different regions of brain. MRI is more sensitive in detecting white matter changes, whereas SPECT is better in detecting cortical and subcortical gray matter abnormalities of perfusion.

### Different antecedents and neonatal condition in neonatal arterial ischemic stroke and hypoxic-ischemic neonatal encephalopathy [^111EUuNC]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Neonates with NAIS and Stage II–III HINE shared a similar incidence of severe neurological symptoms, such as hyponatremia and seizures, whereas no neonate with perinatal asphyxia/Stage I HINE had postnatal neurological complications. Seizures were the leading neurological presenting symptom in infants with NAIS, as previously described.

Brain imaging revealed two typical patterns of brain injury, in line with the available literature.

Hyponatremia and seizures are the result of anatomical brain damage. Evidence of similar neurological symptoms between neonates with NAIS and Stage II–III HINE suggests that these two conditions may share a similar final outcome of brain injury and its clinical characteristics in the neonatal period, even though localization of lesions is different, thus leading to a dissimilar long‐term neurological outcome (i.e. hemiplegia in group A and cerebral palsy in group B).

### Hypertensive emergency successfully treated with metoprolol: a case report [^115Ru2yM]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2009). Low credibility.

It has been estimated that up to 27% of all medical emergencies presenting to emergency departments are due to hypertension, predominantly in the adult population. Although this often is an insidious process, acutely, a hypertensive emergency occurs when a patient presents with severe hypertension and evidence of end organ damage. We discuss the case of a 12-year-old female with spastic cerebral palsy and global developmental delay secondary to neonatal asphyxia who presented to the emergency department after having a seizure at home. On arrival to the emergency department, she was found to have a heart rate (HR) of 170 and a left upper extremity blood pressure of 174/112. Initial electrocardiogram revealed a HR of 163, with significant ST segment elevations in leads I, II, and minimal elevations in V4, 5, and 6. Intravenous Metoprolol 2.5 mg was administered 3 times with 5 minutes interval between doses, which resulted in a decline in HR (106) and blood pressure (128/86), and subsequent resolution of the electrocardiogram changes. An extensive workup revealed the patient had gallstones, however, her hypertension did not resolve with pain control and, ultimately, cholecystectomy. The remainder of her evaluation confirmed the diagnosis of poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis, and her blood pressure was, eventually, controlled with 3 medications: clonidine, isradipine, and amlodipine. Over the ensuing 2 years, these were weaned with no recurrent hypertensive episodes. Although studies have shown extended release Metoprolol to be a safe and effective treatment in children with established hypertension, to the best of our knowledge, it has not been studied in a pediatric emergency setting.

### Clinical features and aetiology of cerebral palsy in children from cross river state, Nigeria [^112XSoCX]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

There are few studies on cerebral palsy (CP) in African children and our study aimed to describe the aetiology, characteristics and severity of CP in children from Nigeria.

Design

A population-based study using key informant methodology (KIM) was conducted as part of a clinical research trial. Children aged 4–15 years were clinically assessed for CP.

Results

The estimated prevalence of CP using KIM was 2.3/1000 children (95%CI 2.0 to 2.5/1000). 388 children were diagnosed with CP, with Gross Motor Function Classification System level 1 in 70 (18.1%), II in 156 (40.2%), III in 54 (13.9%), IV in 54 (13.9%), V in 54 (13.9%). 300/388 (77.3%) had Manual Ability Classification Scale of level 1–3 and 88 (22.7%) of level 4–5. CP types were spastic in 271 (70%), with 60% of these bilateral and 40% unilateral, ataxic 38 (9.8%), dystonic 18 (4.6%), choreoathetoid 29 (7.5%) and unclassifiable 32 (8.3%). Postneonatal risk factors for CP were seen in 140 (36.1%) children including malaria with seizures 101/140 (72.1%), malaria with coma 21/140 (15.0%), meningitis 12/140 (8.6%), tuberculosis 2/140 (1.4%), sickle cell disease 3/140 (2.2%), HIV 1/221 (0.7%). Prenatal/perinatal risk factors were seen in 248 (63.9%%), birth asphyxia 118 (47.6%) and clinical congenital rubella syndrome 8 (3.3%) and hyperbilirubinaemia 59 (23.8%) were identified as preventable risk factors for CP.

Conclusion

The profile of CP in this population is similar to that found in other low-income and middle-income countries (LMIC). Some risk factors identified were preventable. Prevention and management strategies for CP designed for LMIC are needed.

### Coupled obturator neurotomies and lidocaine intrathecal infusion to treat bilateral adductor spasticity and drug-refractory pain [^1142W8fp]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2010). Low credibility.

Spastic diplegia is present in three-fourths of children with cerebral palsy, interfering with gait and frequently accompanied by severe pain. The authors report the case of a 28-year-old woman with history of perinatal hypoxia, who presented with cerebral palsy and severe spastic diplegia (Ashworth Scale Score 4, Tardieu Scale Score 5) and was confined to a wheelchair. She complained of pain in the left hip and knee with mixed neuropathic and somatic components. She consistently rated pain intensity as 10 of 10 on a visual analog scale, and her symptoms were resistant to multiple treatments. The patient underwent selective bilateral adductor myotomies and the implantation of an infusion pump for intrathecal lidocaine application. Postoperative control of pain and spasticity was dramatic (scores of 0 on the Ashworth, Tardieu, and visual analog scales) and persisted throughout a follow-up period of 36 months. This is the first report in the literature of combined selective neurotomies for the treatment of spasticity and chronic lidocaine subarachnoid infusion to treat associated pain. This therapy could represent an alternative to treat spasticity associated with neuropathic and somatic pain.

### Major structural congenital anomalies and causal pathways in people with cerebral palsy [^114mmkDb]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

In the Register data set, maternal age, parity, and plurality apply to the time of birth of the person with CP. Maternal grand multiparity was defined as five or more previous births at 20 or more gestational weeks. Parental consanguinity and dysmorphic features were recorded as present if described as such in the medical records. Condition at birth was deemed poor if any of the following criteria were met: 5‐minute Apgar score lower than 7, requirement for significant resuscitation (ventilation, continuous positive airway pressure, intubation, or chest compressions), or longer than 1 minute to establish regular respirations. Non‐spastic motor types include dyskinesia (dystonic and/or choreo‐athetotic subtypes), ataxia, and hypotonia. A quadriplegic motor type describes involvement of all four limbs. Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) levels III to V describe persons requiring mobility assistance, either with a walking aid or wheelchair. Epilepsy is defined as a history of two or more unprovoked seizures or a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy. A diagnosis of intellectual disability is based on an IQ below 70 on psychometric testing or on clinical grounds.

To explore some of the common causal pathways to CP, causal pathway subgroups were established based on predominant neuroimaging patterns classified according to the Magnetic Resonance Imaging Classification System. Causal pathway subgroups were broadly categorized as: (1) developmental (early prenatal structural or functional disruption to brain development); (2) late prenatal/perinatal destructive insults (white matter and grey matter injury patterns); and (3) brain insults that occurred postneonatally (after the 28th day of life). For more detailed analyses, predominant white matter injuries were further dichotomized based on birth gestation (< 35, > 35 weeks) and subcategories of predominant grey matter injuries were dichotomized as global hypoxic‐ischaemic insults and focal arterial infarctions.

Assessment of the potential for anomalies to have contributed to development of CP, or being pathogenic, was based on imaging evidence supporting the role of cerebral maldevelopments as a cause of CP, and on the potential for the anomaly, or the usual clinical management of the anomaly (often surgery), to be causally related to cerebral hypoxic‐ischaemic or haemorrhagic brain injury.

Results

Clinical assessment

The results are summarized in Table 1. Clinical presentation.

Table 1
Clinical presentation

Forty-seven children fulfilling the SPCE-criteria of hemiplegia were identified and invited to participate in the study. The majority of the 21 children who consented to participate in the study were boys, fifteen. Only six girls took part in the study. Five children were born preterm, three males and two females. Right-sided hemiplegia was present in fourteen and left-sided in seven children. Only one child was dyskinetic, the others were spastic. Cranial nerves were affected in 14 of the 21 children. Strabismus was found in five, hemianopia, or quadrant defect in four children. Sensory neuronal hearing loss occurred in three children, indistinct speech was observed in two.

Out of the forty-two parents, seventeen had higher educational level. The others had mainly lower educational level. Professions were variable.

Risk factors

Five children were born preterm, four of them before 34 weeks´ gestation. Five children were delivered by caesarean section, one because of prenatally diagnosed hydrocephalus. Parturition was rapid in two children, prolonged in one. Diabetes was present in two mothers. Two children were small for gestational age (SGA) and two were large for gestational age (LGA). Neonatal seizures occurred in two of the children, for one concomitantly with asphyxia. One child, caesarean section, because of prenatally diagnosed hydrocephalus, received a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt in the neonatal period. One child was born preterm and suffered postnatal skull trauma, one term child suffered postnatal skull trauma and another underwent postnatal hemisphere-ektomi. Only five of the sixteen children born at term, had no pre- or perinatal risk factor for cerebral palsy. In all only five of the 21 children (24%) had no pre-, peri- or postnatal risk factor for cerebral palsy.

Developmental milestones

Early handedness was present in more than 90% of the cases, 20 out of 21 children. It was noted from 3 months to 1 year of age in 16 out of 21 children. Abnormal or delayed walking was present in eight children.

### Current management of the infant who presents with neonatal encephalopathy [^117AiTEd]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2011). Low credibility.

Neonatal encephalopathy after perinatal hypoxic-ischemic insult is a major contributor to global child mortality and morbidity. Brain injury in term infants in response to hypoxic-ischemic insult is a complex process evolving over hours to days, which provides a unique window of opportunity for neuroprotective treatment interventions. Advances in neuroimaging, brain monitoring techniques, and tissue biomarkers have improved the ability to diagnose, monitor, and care for newborn infants with neonatal encephalopathy as well as predict their outcome. However, challenges remain in early identification of infants at risk for neonatal encephalopathy, determination of timing and extent of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury, as well as optimal management and treatment duration. Therapeutic hypothermia is the most promising neuroprotective intervention to date for infants with moderate to severe neonatal encephalopathy after perinatal asphyxia and has currently been incorporated in many neonatal intensive care units in developed countries. However, only 1 in 6 babies with encephalopathy will benefit from hypothermia therapy; many infants still develop significant adverse outcomes. To enhance the outcome, specific diagnostic predictors are needed to identify patients likely to benefit from hypothermia treatment. Studies are needed to determine the efficacy of combined therapeutic strategies with hypothermia therapy to achieve maximal neuroprotective effect. This review focuses on important concepts in the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of infants with neonatal encephalopathy due to perinatal asphyxia, including an overview of recently introduced novel therapies.

### Hyperbilirubinemia and asphyxia in children with dyskinetic cerebral palsy [^112PHJ5u]. Pediatric Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

We aimed to study the clinical, etiologic, and radiological characteristics in children with dyskinetic cerebral palsy (DCP) and to compare the etiologic subtypes of hyperbilirubinemia and perinatal asphyxia.

Methods

This is a cross-sectional, observational study that enrolled consecutive children with DCP, aged one to 14 years.

Results

Sixty-five children with DCP were evaluated. Most children were boys (77%, n = 50), and term gestation (80%, n = 52). Presenting concerns were global developmental delay (97%, n = 63) and involuntary movements (60%, n = 39). Hyperbilirubinemia (66%, n = 43) and perinatal asphyxia (29%, n = 19) were the most important causes. The majority (83%, n = 54) of children were severely disabled (level V and IV). The hyperbilirubinemia group had significant motor delay (63% vs 37%, P = 0.03) and upward gaze palsy (69.7% vs 31.5%, P = 0.005) when compared with the perinatal asphyxia group. Hyperbilirubinemia significantly involved pallidi (86% vs 10% P = 0.0001) and subthalamic nucleus (26% vs none, P = 0.01), whereas asphyxia significantly involved the putamen (58% vs none, P = 0.0001), thalamus (63% vs none, P = 0.0001), and periventricular white matter (79% vs 19%, P = 0.0001).

Conclusions

DCP is the dominant type of cerebral palsy seen in term-born babies with severe dystonia, developmental delay, and motor impairment. Hyperbilirubinemia is the major cause of DCP in the study. Hyperbilirubinemia is associated with motor delay, upward gaze palsy, prominent dystonia, and involvement of globus pallidi and subthalamic nuclei.

### Factors associated with mortality and neurodevelopmental impairment at 12 months in asphyxiated newborns: a retrospective cohort study in rural tanzania from January 2019 to June 2022 [^116uLYxJ]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Worldwide, the mortality rate of children under five years has been dramatically reduced in the last 20 years, while neonatal mortality now accounts for the majority of such deaths. Around 7,000 neonates die every day and 99% of these deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).

Intrapartum-related events account for 24% of all neonatal deaths and represent the second cause of neonatal mortality after complications due to prematurity. Of note, the neonatal mortality rate is nine times higher in LMICs with respect to high-income countries (HICs).

Within the intrapartum related events, birth asphyxia represents an acute insult to the fetus or newborn which is characterized mainly by tissue hypoxia that may be associated with ischemia.

In HICs, hypoxic-ischemic injury (HII) is defined based on clinical appearance and biochemical markers. HII may lead to various degrees of acute illness such as metabolic derangements, poor muscle tone, breathing problems, alteration in consciousness and seizures which may ultimately result in early neonatal death. Long term morbidities and chronic conditions are mostly represented by neurodevelopmental disorders such as disability (learning and behavioral), poor feeding and cerebral palsy.

The standard care for neonates with birth asphyxia in LMICs should remain normothermia, avoiding both hyper- and hypothermia. Every deviation from euthermia (36.5°-37.5°) at admission in the neonatal unit has been associated with an increased risk of mortality. A recent study in Tanzania suggested that deviations from euthermia at admission may also be associated with an increased risk of developing cerebral palsy in survivors at one month of life.

In LMICs, the diagnosis of perinatal asphyxia is usually performed according to clinical assessments such as the Apgar score and the neurological evaluation by Sarnat&Sarnat. This neurological evaluation assesses level of consciousness, motility, posture, tone, reflexes and the pupil, leading to the classification in different stages of HII (mild, moderate and severe) that have been associated with early neurological status and short-term prognosis.

### Causes and risk factors of cerebral palsy | CDC… [^111ckpvi]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Causes and Risk Factors of Cerebral Palsy Cerebral palsy is caused by abnormal development of the brain or damage to the developing brain that affects a child's ability to control his or her muscles. There are several possible causes of the abnormal development or damage. People used to think that CP was mainly caused by lack of oxygen during the birth process. Now, scientists think that this causes only a small number of CP cases. The abnormal development of the brain or damage that leads to CP can happen before birth, during birth, within a month after birth, or during the first years of a child's life, while the brain is still developing.
- Multiple births―Twins, triplets, and other multiple births have a higher risk for CP, especially if a baby's twin or triplet dies before birth or shortly after birth. Some, but not all of this increased risk is due to the fact that children born from multiple pregnancies often are born early or with low birthweight, or both. Read summary.
- Assisted reproductive technology infertility treatments―Children born from pregnancies resulting from the use of some infertility treatments have a greater chance of having CP. Most of the increased risk is explained by preterm delivery or multiple births, or both; both preterm delivery and multiple births are increased among children conceived with ART infertility treatments. Read article, Read summary.
- Infections during pregnancy―Infections can lead to increases in certain proteins called cytokinesthat circulate in the brain and blood of the baby during pregnancy. Cytokines cause inflammation, which can lead to brain damage in the baby. Fever in the mother during pregnancy or delivery also can cause this problem. Some types of infection that have been linked with CP include viruses such as chickenpox, rubella, and cytomegalovirus, and bacterial infections such as infections of the placenta or fetal membranes, or maternal pelvic infections.

Read summary, Read article.
- Medical conditions of the mother―Mothers with thyroid problems, intellectual disability, or seizures have a slightly higher risk of having a child with CP. Read summary
- Birth complications―Detachment of the placenta, uterine rupture, or problems with the umbilical cord during birth can disrupt oxygen supply to the baby and result in CP. Read summary.

### About cerebral palsy… [^113emkpQ]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Dyskinetic cerebral palsy People with dyskinetic CP have problems controlling the movement of their hands, arms, feet, and legs, making it difficult to sit and walk. In a baby younger than 6 months of age
- Their head lags when you pick him up while he's lying on his back.
- They feel stiff.
- They feel floppy.
- When held cradled in your arms, they seem to overextend his back and neck, constantly acting as if they are pushing away from you.
- When you pick them up, their legs get stiff, and they cross or scissor. In a baby older than 6 months of age
- They don't roll over in either direction.
- They cannot bring her hands together.
- They have difficulty bringing their hands to their mouth.
- They reach out with only one hand while keeping the other fisted. In a baby older than 10 months of age
- They crawl in a lopsided manner, pushing off with one hand and leg while dragging the opposite hand and leg.
- They scoot around on their buttocks or hops on their knees but do not crawl on all fours. Tell your child's doctor or nurse if you notice any of these signs.

There are several possible causes of the abnormal development or damage. People used to think that CP was mainly caused by lack of oxygen during the birth process. Now, scientists think that this causes only a small number of CP cases. The abnormal development of the brain or damage that leads to CP can happen before birth, during birth, within a month after birth, or during the first years of a child's life, while the brain is still developing. CP related to abnormal development of the brain or damage that occurred before or during birth is called congenital CP. The majority of CP is congenital.

In many cases, the specific cause is not known. A small percentage of CP is caused by abnormal development of the brain or damage that occurs more than 28 days after birth. This is called acquired CP and usually is associated with an infection or head injury. Keep Reading: Risk Factors for Cerebral Palsy.
