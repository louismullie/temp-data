## Question

mrcp needs IV contrast?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether MRCP needs IV contrast. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the physics and standard sequences that underpin MRCP. Then, I should distinguish standard MRCP from enhanced variants that use either gadolinium-based hepatobiliary agents or secretin. Next, I will consider the clinical indications where each approach adds value. After that, I need to review safety and guideline considerations for IV agents. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, patient-centered recommendation and answer the question directly.

> Let me first confirm the core principle. Standard MRCP is a non-invasive, non-contrast MRI technique that relies on heavily T2-weighted sequences to make static fluid (bile and pancreatic juice) appear bright, thereby delineating the biliary and pancreatic ducts without any exogenous IV contrast agent, and it is widely used as a diagnostic alternative to ERCP in many settings [^1122qGSc] [^116jNerb] [^1114oD7S].

> Hold on, let's not conflate terms. There is a distinct variant sometimes called hepatobiliary-phase or gadoxetic acid–enhanced MR imaging of the bile ducts that uses gadolinium-based contrast (e.g., gadoxetate disodium/Eovist) to visualize bile on delayed T1-weighted images; this is not the standard T2-weighted MRCP, but a complementary problem-solving study particularly useful for biliary leaks and delineation of non-dilated ducts in postoperative or donor evaluations [^1168Uj6a] [^116nVx9B] [^114syCCU].

> Wait, let me verify the role of secretin. Secretin-enhanced MRCP (S‑MRCP) involves IV secretin (a hormone, not a gadolinium contrast agent) to transiently increase pancreatic fluid, enabling dynamic assessment of pancreatic ductal anatomy and function; meta-analysis shows markedly improved sensitivity for pancreas divisum versus standard MRCP, and pediatric consensus also endorses S‑MRCP for ductal evaluation where available [^113Ts5hM] [^117LSrnR] [^1122kHSq].

> I should confirm adjuncts sometimes used without gadolinium. Intravenous glucagon can reduce duodenal motion to improve duct visualization during T2 MRCP, which is a motility agent rather than a contrast medium; in parallel, for suspected choledocholithiasis, MRCP performs well and is often paired with or complemented by EUS when small stones are suspected or MRCP is negative, reflecting their differing strengths and limitations [^1125HoVP] [^115MdkHe] [^113MYoPG].

> Next, I should review when gadolinium-enhanced hepatobiliary imaging actually changes management. Gadoxetic acid–enhanced delayed T1 imaging can confirm biliary leaks by showing contrast extravasation into collections and can improve depiction of non-dilated ducts or complex biliary variants; trauma and postoperative guidelines also note MRCP with hepatobiliary contrast for suspected biliary injuries, underscoring that this is a targeted application rather than routine [^1168Uj6a] [^113piXjB] [^116nVx9B].

> But wait, I need to consider safety and stewardship. GBCAs have an excellent overall safety record yet carry considerations including hypersensitivity reactions, gadolinium deposition, and historical NSF risk in severe CKD — now drastically reduced with macrocyclic and hepatobiliary agents used judiciously; contemporary recommendations emphasize using GBCA only when it is appropriate and likely to influence clinical decisions, and product labels contraindicate use in patients with known GBCA hypersensitivity [^114UfEJU] [^112X7yva] [^115kt4QG] [^112excdm].

> Let me synthesize and answer directly. No — standard MRCP does not need IV contrast; it is inherently T2-based and typically performed without any IV agent. However, there are two important exceptions for specific questions: gadoxetic acid–enhanced hepatobiliary-phase imaging for bile leak or non-dilated duct visualization, and secretin-enhanced MRCP (IV secretin) for dynamic pancreatic duct evaluation and suspected pancreas divisum or functional obstruction [^1122qGSc] [^1168Uj6a] [^113Ts5hM].

> Finally, I need to ensure a practical pathway. Start with non-contrast T2 MRCP for most biliary/pancreatic questions; add S‑MRCP when ductal function or pancreas divisum is suspected; reserve gadoxetic acid–enhanced hepatobiliary imaging for leaks, complex postoperative anatomy, or non-dilated duct mapping, while applying GBCA stewardship consistent with expert recommendations and disease-specific guidance such as PSC MRCP standards that rely primarily on high-quality T2 MRCP [^113Ts5hM] [^116nVx9B] [^115kt4QG] [^116jNerb].

---

No, MRCP does not require **IV contrast** [^116jNerb] because it uses heavily T2-weighted sequences [^1122qGSc] that naturally highlight bile and pancreatic ducts [^1114oD7S]. IV gadolinium is **only used selectively** [^115kt4QG] when additional soft-tissue or vascular detail is needed [^1114oD7S], such as for suspected malignancy, inflammation [^114fSi1j], or postoperative bile leaks [^1168Uj6a]. Routine MRCP is **non-contrast**, and contrast is reserved for specific clinical questions [^1144NyCM].

---

## Standard MRCP technique

- **Heavily T2-weighted sequences**: MRCP relies on heavily T2-weighted sequences, which naturally highlight static or slow-moving fluids such as bile and pancreatic secretions [^114xRC44], providing high-contrast images of the ductal system without the need for contrast agents [^1122qGSc].

- **Non-invasive and radiation-free**: MRCP is a non-invasive technique that does not involve ionizing radiation [^114xRC44], making it a safe alternative to invasive procedures like ERCP [^114QjzYr].

- **Clinical indications**: MRCP is commonly used to evaluate biliary obstruction, choledocholithiasis, strictures, congenital anomalies [^116ibh5Z], and pancreatic ductal abnormalities [^113Ts5hM].

---

## Situations where IV contrast may be used in MRCP

Although standard MRCP does not require IV contrast, **selective administration** of gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) may be beneficial in **specific clinical scenarios** [^115kt4QG]:

- **Suspected malignancy**: IV contrast-enhanced MRI may be used to evaluate suspected malignancies, such as cholangiocarcinoma or pancreatic cancer [^1144NyCM], by providing additional information about tumor vascularity, enhancement patterns, and extent of disease [^1114oD7S].

- **Inflammatory conditions**: In cases of suspected inflammatory conditions, such as autoimmune pancreatitis or acute cholecystitis [^114fSi1j], IV contrast can help differentiate inflammatory tissue from normal tissue and assess the extent of inflammation [^1114oD7S].

- **Postoperative bile leaks**: Gadolinium-enhanced MRCP can be useful in detecting and characterizing postoperative bile leaks, particularly when conventional MRCP sequences are inconclusive [^1168Uj6a] [^116nVx9B].

---

## Risks and considerations associated with IV contrast in MRCP

Use of IV contrast agents in MRCP is **generally safe** [^112X7yva], but several risks and considerations should be recognized:

- **Allergic reactions**: Although rare, allergic reactions to gadolinium-based contrast agents can occur, ranging from mild hypersensitivity reactions to severe anaphylactic reactions [^112excdm] [^114yyFUX].

- **Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF)**: Patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²) are at risk of developing NSF, a rare but serious condition associated with gadolinium exposure [^114yyFUX] [^114UfEJU].

- **Gadolinium deposition**: Recent studies have shown that gadolinium can accumulate in the brain and other tissues after repeated exposure, although the clinical significance of this finding remains unclear [^114yyFUX] [^112X7yva].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines emphasize that IV contrast should **only be used** in MRCP when clearly indicated by specific clinical questions or diagnostic uncertainties [^115kt4QG]. For **routine MRCP**, IV contrast is not required and should not be administered unnecessarily [^1144NyCM]. Selective use is appropriate when **additional information** about soft tissue, vascular structures, or suspected malignancies is needed [^116nVx9B] [^1114oD7S].

---

## Alternative imaging modalities

When IV contrast is contraindicated or not recommended, **alternative imaging modalities** include **endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)**, which is highly sensitive for detecting small biliary stones or strictures, particularly when MRCP is inconclusive or contraindicated [^115MdkHe], and **computed tomography (CT)** cholangiography, which may be used in select scenarios but involves ionizing radiation and iodinated contrast agents [^113MYoPG].

---

MRCP does not require **IV contrast** for routine imaging, as it relies on heavily T2-weighted sequences to visualize the biliary and pancreatic ducts [^114xRC44]. IV contrast may be used selectively in specific clinical scenarios, such as suspected malignancy, inflammation, or postoperative bile leaks. The decision to use IV contrast should be based on clinical indications, patient safety considerations, and diagnostic needs [^115kt4QG].

### Early cross-sectional imaging following open and laparoscopic cholecystectomy: A primer for radiologists [^1168Uj6a]. Insights into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRCP may prove useful to confirm and visualize suspected biliary leakage, particularly in patients with jaundice, abnormal or worsening serum bilirubin and liver function tests, and when postoperative imaging shows a persistent fluid collection suggestive of biloma. Taken up by functioning hepatocytes, liver-specific MR contrast agents were developed to improve the detection and characterization of liver lesions. Among them, gadoxetic acid (gadolinium ethoxybenzyl diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid or Gd-EOB-DTPA; Primovist, Bayer Schering Pharma, Berlin, Germany) combines features of an extracellular paramagnetic and a liver-specific contrast. Being excreted via the biliary system in a 50% proportion, it causes T1-shortening of bile. Therefore, it can be used with isotropic volume-interpolated T1-weighted gradient-echo sequences (such as liver acquisition with volume acceleration [LAVA], T1-weighted high-resolution isotropic volume examination [THRIVE], or volumetric interpolated breath-hold examination [VIBE]) to obtain ultra-delayed biliary phase images 45–60 minutes (optionally 90 minutes) after injection. Provided that liver function is preserved, gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRCP visualizes the opacified intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts and cystic duct remnant and may allow the detection of extravasated bile into collections, perihepatic fluid, or both, thus providing diagnostic confirmation and anatomic definition of bile leakage.

### Advantages of BioMatrix respiratory gating in free-breathing three-dimensional magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography: a prospective comparative study [^1122qGSc]. Insights into Imaging (2025). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is a non-invasive imaging technique utilizing heavily T2-weighted sequences to produce high-contrast images of fluid-filled structures such as the pancreatic and biliary ducts. This technique facilitates the evaluation of the morphology, patency, and pathological changes in these duct systems. Due to its safety and accuracy, MRCP has emerged as a non-invasive alternative to endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).

Early two-dimensional MRCP was hampered by spatial resolution limitations. The advent of three-dimensional scanning sequences has notably improved image quality and lesion visualization. These sequences allow isotropic imaging through multiplanar reconstruction, addressing previous limitations. Despite these advancements, prolonged acquisition times remain susceptible to motion artifacts. Various breath-holding techniques, such as rapid spin-echo and compressed sensing, have reduced scan times to under 20 seconds. However, their utility is limited in patients with impaired pulmonary function or frailty, who may find it challenging to comply with breath-holding requirements.

Respiratory-gated techniques provide a viable alternative for patients unable to hold their breath. Common free-breathing MRCP techniques include respiratory belt gating (RG) and diaphragm navigator triggering (NT). RG involves the installation of an external device, while NT requires precise adjustment of the navigator position and a pre-learning process. Recent efforts have also explored compressed sensing MRCP combined with contact-free physiological monitoring.

### Accuracy and timeliness of an abbreviated emergency department MRCP protocol for choledocholithiasis [^116u98QG]. Emergency Radiology (2019). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to determine the diagnostic accuracy and time savings of an abbreviated magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (A-MRCP) protocol for detecting choledocholithiasis in patients visiting the emergency department (ED) for suspected biliary obstruction.

- **Methods and materials**: This retrospective study evaluated adult patients (ages 18+ years) visiting an academic Level 1 trauma center between January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2017, who were imaged with MRCP for suspected biliary obstruction. Patients were scanned with either a four-sequence A-MRCP protocol or a conventional eight-sequence MRCP (C-MRCP) protocol. Image acquisition and MRI room time were compared. The radiology report was used to determine whether a study was limited by motion or prematurely aborted, as well as for the presence of pertinent biliary findings. Diagnostic accuracy of A-MRCP studies was compared with any available endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) report within 30 days.

- **Results**: One hundred sixteen patients met inclusion criteria; 85 were scanned with the A-MRCP protocol (45.9% male, mean 57.4 years) and 31 with the C-MRCP protocol (38.7% male, mean 58.3 years). Mean image acquisition time and MRI room time for the A-MRCP protocol were significantly lower compared to those for the C-MRCP protocol (16 and 34 min vs. 42 and 61 min, both p < 0.0001). Choledocholithiasis was seen in 23.5% of A-MRCP cases and 19.4% of C-MRCP cases. Non-biliary findings were common in both cohorts, comprising 56.5% of A-MRCP cases and 41.9% of C-MRCP cases. 44.7% of A-MRCP patients received

### Hypersensitivity reactions after diagnostic nonvascular administration of iodine-based contrast media and gadolinium-based contrast agents and the role of the drug allergy specialist [^113H7GZJ]. European Journal of Radiology (2024). Low credibility.

The risk of hypersensitivity reactions (HSR) following nonvascular administration of contrast media (CM) for diagnostic studies is very low, likely due to minimal absorption into the systemic circulation. Most published individual cases of HSR after nonvascular CM administration are immediate reactions caused by ionic high-osmolar CM, few by nonionic low-osmolar CM, and none by gadolinium-based contrast agents. Measures to prevent reHSR following nonvascular administration are similar to those recommended to prevent HSR after intravascular CM administration. Premedication as a preventive measure has been abandoned, while switching to an alternative CM, preferably based on the results of an allergological analysis, is increasingly advocated. In selected scenarios, preventive measures may be minimized.

### Gadolinium based contrast agents (GBCA): Safety overview after 3 decades of clinical experience [^112X7yva]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

In the past three decades, we have learned much about the potential short-term and long-term safety issues associated with the intravenous administration of gadolinium based contrast agents (GBCAs). Yet, surprisingly, the past few years and even months have been accompanied by new discoveries in this field. This manuscript focuses predominantly on what we have learned — and are continuing to learn — about the long-term potential MR safety issues associated with the administration of the various GBCAs available today. It will highlight areas in which they appear to differ from each other, at least in a quantitative fashion, if not qualitatively.

### Clinical impact of allergy and pre-medication in CT studies with low-osmolality intravenous iodinated contrast media [^115HR1WT]. Clinical Radiology (2022). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the occurrence and severity of allergic reactions to iodinated contrast media (ICM), including associated risk factors and the impact of pre-medication.

- **Materials and methods**: Data on patients who had experienced allergic reactions during outpatient computed tomography (CT) examinations between January 2014 and September 2018 were analyzed retrospectively. Response severity was assessed according to validated criteria. A control group was selected among individuals who underwent CT during the study period and did not experience allergic reactions.

- **Results**: Screening of 36,920 CT studies revealed 74 (0.2%) individuals with systemic reactions to ICM. No significant differences in patient characteristics were found among patients who experienced mild (n = 54), moderate (n = 17), or severe (n = 4) reactions. Previous ICM allergy was reported in 10 patients (13.3%). Patients with a history of ICM allergy had mild (9/10) or moderate (1/10) reactions, with one individual showing decreased intensity of the allergic response compared to a previous event. Within the control group, four patients (4%) had previous ICM allergy. In these individuals, the lack of allergic reactions could not be attributed to pre-medication. All patients with severe reactions did not have a prior history of ICM allergy.

- **Conclusion**: Severe allergic reactions to ICM are rare, lack significant risk factors, and do not appear to be impacted by pre-medication. The findings presented herein highlight the need for prospective work that will re-evaluate the yield of pre-medication protocols.

### Predictors of abnormalities on magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography: Is there a role when the biliary tree is normal on previous imaging [^112B7Y6U]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) allows for more detailed investigation, providing opportunities to diagnose conditions such as cholangiocarcinomas, ductal tumors, and pancreatic disorders, as well as to exclude these in patients who present with painless jaundice. Such diagnoses were observed in some of the patients in this study.

We selected several independent factors and analyzed the likelihood of returning an abnormal MRCP. It is already known that abnormal index imaging, whether through ultrasound (US), which is excellent at measuring ductal size, or a CT scan, indicates the need to progress to MRCP to further characterize the abnormality. Traditionally, the elevation of bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) has been associated with biliary obstruction. However, our study revealed a significant association only with elevated ALP. The remainder of the transaminases and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) were not significant. From multiple liver function tests (LFTs) available in the system, we selected the results prior to initial US/CT imaging.

Furthermore, we examined the relationship between the clinical indication for imaging and the MRCP outcome. Clinical jaundice was associated with an abnormal MRCP. These findings suggest that an abnormal common bile duct (CBD) on US/CT, elevated ALP, and clinical jaundice are most likely to return an abnormal MRCP with a dilated biliary system. However, in clinical practice, it is recognized and established that US is the preferred initial imaging method for the biliary system. It is more accessible, less time-consuming, inexpensive, and provides immediate results. Interestingly, elevated bilirubin was not associated with an abnormal MRCP, whereas clinical jaundice was.

### Risks and options with gadolinium-based contrast agents in patients with CKD: A review [^114UfEJU]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) improve the diagnostic capabilities of magnetic resonance imaging. Although initially believed to be without major adverse effects, GBCA use in patients with severe chronic kidney disease (CKD) was demonstrated to cause nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF). Restrictive policies of GBCA use in CKD and selective use of GBCAs that bind free gadolinium more strongly have resulted in the virtual elimination of NSF cases. Contemporary studies of the use of GBCAs with high binding affinity for free gadolinium in severe CKD demonstrate an absence of NSF. Despite these observations and the limitations of contemporary studies, physicians remain concerned about GBCA use in severe CKD.

Concerns of GBCA use in severe CKD are magnified by recent observations demonstrating gadolinium deposition in the brain and a possible systemic syndrome attributed to GBCAs. Radiologic advances have resulted in several new imaging modalities that can be used in the severe CKD population and that do not require GBCA administration. In this article, we critically review GBCA use in patients with severe CKD and provide recommendations regarding GBCA use in this population.

### Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography with compressed sensing at 1.5 T: Clinical application for the evaluation of branch duct IPMN of the pancreas [^115RJiA6]. European Radiology (2020). Low credibility.

MRCP imaging with CS-SPACE for the evaluation of BD-IPMN at 1.5 T provides the best results using a short breath-hold sequence, with results comparable to conventional NT-SPACE and superior to NT-CS-SPACE. This approach is feasible and an excellent alternative to standard 3D NT-MRCP sequences, especially concerning the diagnosis and follow-up of BD-IPMN.

### Detection of common bile duct stones: Comparison between endoscopic ultrasonography, magnetic resonance cholangiography, and helical-computed-tomographic cholangiography [^113MYoPG]. European Journal of Radiology (2005). Low credibility.

New modalities, namely, endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS), magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), and helical computed-tomographic cholangiography (HCT-C), have been introduced recently for the detection of common bile duct (CBD) stones and shown improved detectability compared to conventional ultrasound or computed tomography. We conducted this study to compare the diagnostic ability of EUS, MRCP, and HCT-C in patients with suspected choledocholithiasis.

Twenty-eight patients clinically suspected of having CBD stones were enrolled, excluding those with cholangitis or a definite history of choledocholithiasis. Each patient underwent EUS, MRCP, and HCT-C prior to endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP), the result of which served as the diagnostic gold standard.

CBD stones were detected in 24 (86%) of 28 patients by ERCP/IDUS. The sensitivity of EUS, MRCP, and HCT-C was 100%, 88%, and 88%, respectively. False negative cases for MRCP and HCT-C had a CBD stone smaller than 5mm in diameter. No serious complications occurred, while one patient complained of itching in the eyelids after the infusion of contrast agent on HCT-C.

When examination can be scheduled, MRCP or HCT-C will be the first choice because they were less invasive than EUS. MRCP and HCT-C had similar detectability, but the former may be preferable considering the possibility of allergic reaction in the latter. When MRCP is negative, EUS is recommended to check for small CBD stones.

### Does intravenous glucagon improve common bile duct visualisation during magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography? Results in 42 patients [^1125HoVP]. European Journal of Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) has been demonstrated as a reliable, non-invasive means of biliary tract imaging among patients with suspected choledocholithiasis. The aim of this study was to establish the impact of intravenous glucagon administration (IVGA) upon visualisation of the common bile duct (CBD) and ampulla of Vater during MRCP.

- **Materials and methods**: Forty-two consecutive, non-diabetic subjects with a working diagnosis of symptomatic choledocholithiasis were scanned, pre- and post-IVGA, using the half-Fourier, single shot, turbo-spin-echo (HASTE) sequence. Maximum intensity projections, optimized for the extra-hepatic biliary tree and ampulla of Vater, were reviewed blindly by three consultant radiologists. The CBD images were graded (0–3) according to the length of duct seen. The ampullary images were graded according to whether it was visualised clearly (1) or not (0).

- **Results**: Following IVGA, the CBD was visualised at grade 3 (75–100% of length seen) in 14 additional patients compared with images prior to IVGA. Furthermore, ampullary visualisation was considered diagnostic in 18 additional patients post-IVGA. No glucagon-associated adverse effects were observed.

- **Conclusion**: These results demonstrate that IVGA improved visualisation of the CBD and ampulla of Vater during magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography. This may reduce the requirement for repeat investigation or recourse to invasive diagnostic procedures, such as endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).

### Clinical applications of magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography [^116ibh5Z]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is a novel imaging technique used for the noninvasive work-up of patients with pancreaticobiliary disease. MRCP is useful in the evaluation of a host of pancreaticobiliary disorders, such as congenital disorders, calculus disease, biliary strictures, sclerosing cholangitis, chronic pancreatitis, and cystic pancreatic lesions. It not only provides useful preoperative information to surgeons and gastroenterologists but also serves as a valuable tool in the assessment of postoperative pancreaticobiliary ductal anatomy. Recent refinement of techniques allows faster imaging with superior image resolution. This review summarizes the role of MRCP in clinical practice.

### Hypersensitivity reactions and contrast medium injection: Are they always related [^116Nahzk]? European Journal of Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

Hypersensitivity (allergic or non-allergic) reactions that occur after contrast medium (CM) injection are usually related to the CM. Recent studies and case reports lack the analysis of alternate causes that could also be responsible in individual cases.

- **Patients and methods**: We investigated the individual relevant factors or causative agents of adult patients with hypersensitivity reactions that occurred in radiological units during CM-enhanced procedures such as CT, angiography, urography, or MR-examinations. Both immediate and non-immediate (delayed) reactions were included. To identify the relevant agent, a detailed patient history was carefully analyzed. In addition, the records were retrospectively reviewed. If indicated and possible, laboratory tests (e.g. basophil activation test) and skin tests (e.g. prick) and/or provocations with CM-injections under routine conditions were performed.

- **Results**: Thirty-eight patients (men n = 21) suspected of CM-hypersensitivity reactions were identified. These reactions were in most cases mild (n = 21), moderate reactions occurred in 13 cases, and four patients had severe reactions. In 28 patients, the reactions were induced by the CM (iodinated CM in 25 cases). Four patients had reactions that were not CM-related (latex allergy, adenosine reaction, vasovagal reaction, unknown cause), and in six cases the reaction was partly CM-related (immunological activation was present due to the patients' diseases).

- **Conclusion**: Our data support the hypothesis that in CM-enhanced procedures, not only contrast materials but also a broad range of other factors can induce hypersensitivity reactions.

### Waiting times between examinations with intravascularly administered contrast media: A review of contrast media pharmacokinetics and updated ESUR Contrast Media Safety Committee guidelines [^114MrxZ9]. European Radiology (2024). Low credibility.

The recommendations of the Contrast Media Safety Committee (CMSC) are based on a formal literature review, incorporating more detailed differentiation of patient groups, and including recommendations for combinations of imaging studies within brief time intervals. Previous recommendations found in the electronic ESUR guidelines v10 relied more heavily on limited expert opinions, focusing on fewer patient group distinctions and emphasizing 75% excretion or two half-lives.

For patients with normal renal function, the minimal waiting times for iodine-based contrast media (ICM) and gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCA), as well as for those with severely reduced renal function, align closely with previous guidance.

- **Safe time intervals in enhanced imaging with iodine-based contrast media**:
	- The CMSC recommends specific waiting times between successive administrations of iodine-based contrast media in contrast-enhanced CT or (coronary) angiography to prevent the accumulation of iodine-based contrast media, which could pose safety risks.

- **Safe time intervals in enhanced imaging with gadolinium-based contrast agents**:
	- The CMSC advises on waiting periods between successive administrations of gadolinium-based contrast agents in contrast-enhanced MRI to avoid the accumulation of these agents, thereby mitigating potential safety concerns.

- **Safe time intervals in combined enhanced imaging with an iodine-based contrast medium and a gadolinium-based contrast agent**:
	- The CMSC recommends precise waiting times between contrast-enhanced MRI and contrast-enhanced imaging using both an iodine-based and a gadolinium-based contrast agent to ensure patient safety.

### Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography in the diagnosis of pancreas divisum: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113Ts5hM]. Pancreas (2014). High credibility.

This study aimed to perform a structured meta-analysis of all eligible studies to assess the overall diagnostic use of magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) alone or with secretin enhancement (secretin-enhanced MRCP [S-MRCP]) in the detection of pancreas divisum.

Two authors independently performed a comprehensive search of PubMed, MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Library from inception to September 2013. Studies were included if they allowed construction of 2 × 2 contingency tables of MRCP and/or S-MRCP compared with the criterion standard. DerSimonian-Laird random effect models were used to estimate the pooled sensitivity, specificity, and quantitative receiver operating characteristics.

Of 51 citations, 10 studies with 1474 patients were included. Secretin-enhanced MRCP had a higher overall diagnostic performance than MRCP: pooled sensitivity was 86% (95% confidence interval, 77%-93%), specificity 97% (95% CI, 94%-99%), and area under the curve 0.93 ± 0.056. In comparison, MRCP had a sensitivity of 52% (95% CI, 45%-59%), specificity 97% (95% CI, 94%-99%), and area under the curve 0.76 ± 0.104. Pooled diagnostic odds ratios were 72.19 (95% CI, 5.66–938.8) for S-MRCP and 23.39 (95% CI, 7.93–69.02) for MRCP. Visual inspection of the funnel plot showed low potential for publication bias.

Secretin-enhanced MRCP has a much higher diagnostic accuracy than MRCP and should be preferred for the diagnosis of pancreas divisum.

### ESR essentials: gadolinium-wise MRI-practice recommendations by the European Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine and Biology [^115kt4QG]. European Radiology (2025). Low credibility.

Optimization beyond dosage: appropriateness and clinical indications

Dose optimization is recommended, as administering a lower-than-standard dose can still provide diagnostic information that is equally effective. However, it must be acknowledged that disease processes and potentially MRI settings influence contrast enhancement. Beyond this effort, it is crucial that before considering dosage options, the radiologist must assess clinical indication, feasibility, appropriateness, and necessity of injecting GBCA to address a clinical question. This includes a risk-benefit analysis for each patient according to updated guidelines and scientific evidence.

### What does the boxed warning tell us? Safe practice of using ferumoxytol as an MRI contrast agent [^111k5odx]. AJNR. American Journal of Neuroradiology (2017). Low credibility.

Despite the label change and the FDA's boxed warning added to the Feraheme (ferumoxytol) label in March 2015, radiologists have shown increasing interest in using ferumoxytol as an MR imaging contrast agent as a supplement or alternative to gadolinium. The goals of this study were to provide information regarding ferumoxytol safety as an imaging agent in a single center and to assess how the Feraheme label change may affect this potential, currently off-label indication.

- **Materials and methods**: This retrospective study evaluated the overall frequency of ferumoxytol-related adverse events when used for CNS MR imaging. Patients with various CNS pathologies were enrolled in institutional review board-approved imaging studies. Ferumoxytol was administered as multiple rapid bolus injections. The risk of adverse events was correlated with demographic data/medical history.

- **Results**: The safety of 671 ferumoxytol-enhanced MR studies in 331 patients was analyzed. No anaphylactic, life-threatening, or fatal (grade 4 or 5) adverse events were recorded. The overall proportion of ferumoxytol-related grade 1–3 adverse events was 10.6% (8.6% occurring within 48 hours), including hypertension (2.38%), nausea (1.64%), diarrhea (1.04%), and headache (1.04%). History of 1 or 2 allergies was associated with an increased risk of adverse events (14.61% versus 7.51% [no history]; p = 0.007).

- **Conclusions**: The frequency of mild ferumoxytol-related adverse events was comparable with literature results, and no serious adverse event was recorded.

### Routine MRCP in the management of patients with gallbladder stones awaiting cholecystectomy: A single-centre experience [^116jNerb]. Insights into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

However, these techniques have limitations, such as the low sensitivity of US for detecting CBD calculi, detecting only from 33 to 55% of the CBD stones. In our results, the sensitivity of the US (14.3%) is clearly lower than other studies; this is explainable by a large variability in sensitivity due to the fact that US is an operator-dependent technique.

Computed tomography is associated with ionising radiation and is unreliable for detecting non-calcified stones.

ERCP was accepted as the "gold standard" for bile duct imaging, with the advantage of permitting the bile duct to be cleared of stones. However, it is an invasive technique, with a reported mortality rate of 0.1–3% and complications including pancreatitis, cholangitis, perforation, and bleeding. Ideally, its use should be restricted to therapeutic procedures alone and not recommended as a routine examination. Intravenous cholangiography has the same sensitivity and specificity as ERCP; however, it is an invasive technique and is associated with ionising radiation.

MRCP is a non-invasive imaging technique that does not require the use of X-rays or contrast media. The most important drawbacks of MRCP are its inability to offer therapeutic interventions and its high cost. The criteria for a positive MRCP were signal defects within the CBD, defined variably as foci or rounded and oval in some studies. MRCP has been shown to demonstrate normal and variant biliary anatomy accurately, as well as benign and malignant causes of bile duct obstruction with a sensitivity and specificity of 95–100% in the detection of.

### Diagnostic yield of secretin-enhanced magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography in the investigation of patients with acalculous biliary pain [^1122kHSq]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

A total of 114 (97.4%) patients successfully completed the secretin-enhanced magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (S-MRCP) test. Secretin was not administered in two patients: one had baseline magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) showing features of acute pancreatitis, and the other had definite evidence of complete pancreatic duct obstruction. One patient could not complete the S-MRCP test due to claustrophobia. No patients developed pain after the injection of secretin, no immediate adverse reactions were identified, and there were no recorded cases of post-secretin pancreatitis.

- **Findings from the S-MRCP test**: The most common abnormality identified on S-MRCP was obstruction at the level of the ampulla or in the proximal pancreatic duct. S-MRCP provided additional information and/or suggested alternative diagnoses in 40 (35%) patients compared to MRCP. Among the 37 patients with normal MRCP results, S-MRCP identified significant pathological findings in 8 (22%) patients. In this subgroup, 5 patients had obstructions at the level of the ampulla or proximal pancreatic duct; all underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and sphincterotomy.

In the present study, 78 (67%) patients had endoscopic ultrasound (EUS). The findings from S-MRCP differed from those of EUS in 53 (68%) patients, while in 25 (32%) patients, findings were similar. Of the 41 patients who had a normal EUS, S-MRCP was also reported as normal in 19.

### Cystic pancreatic lesions: MR imaging findings and management [^113Cq1GU]. Insights into Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

Nowadays, cystic pancreatic lesions (CPLs) can be detected with most imaging techniques, including ultrasound (US), multidetector computed tomography (MDCT), and magnetic resonance imaging with magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRI with MRCP). However, for correct characterization, MDCT and MRI are needed. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is another useful imaging technique for accurately characterizing CPLs, but its use is primarily managed by gastroenterologists and is beyond the scope of this paper.

MRI with MRCP, thanks to its high contrast resolution and high sensitivity to static fluids on T2-weighted sequences, is the optimal imaging technique to assess communication with the main pancreatic duct (MPD), which is the key factor in characterizing a CPL. On the other hand, MDCT is superior for demonstrating the presence, intra-lesional localization, and size of calcifications, which are helpful in differential diagnosis. Moreover, in elderly and uncooperative patients, MDCT with curved multiplanar reconstruction (MPR) post-processing is a valid technique to assess communication with the MPD. Both MRI with MRCP and MDCT exhibit high diagnostic performance in differentiating benign from malignant CPLs, with accuracy ranging from 73 to 81% for MRI and 75% to 78% for MDCT, respectively.

- **CPLs non-communicating with MPD**: Non-neoplastic lesions are discussed in terms of their diagnostic implications and management strategies.

Although diagnostic endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) has been replaced in many fields by magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), considerable amounts of research are still ongoing. Major fields of interest include ways of reducing the incidence of post-ERCP pancreatitis, new methods for improving the yield of tissue sampling, and the diagnosis of sphincter of Oddi dysfunction. Additionally, there are new data comparing the diagnostic accuracy of ERCP with that of MRCP and endoscopic ultrasonography.

### Secretin-stimulated MR cholangiopancreatography: spectrum of findings in pancreatic diseases [^112Yrcbz]. Insights into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

- **Inflammatory ampullary stenosis**: MRCP obtained before secretin administration reveals distal common bile duct stenosis, with consequent dilatation of extra-hepatic bile ducts. The head portion of the pancreatic duct is only slightly dilated. MRCP obtained three minutes after secretin injection shows increasing diameter of the pancreatic duct, and after 15 minutes, demonstrates duodenal filling up to genu inferius (grade 2), interpreted as reduced exocrine pancreatic reserve. Endoscopic evaluation with papillary biopsy confirmed the diagnosis.

- **Focal pancreatic lesions**: The detection of a focal enlargement or distortion of the normal contour of the pancreas is a common finding for radiologists who treat pancreatic diseases. Patients with such focal enlargements of the pancreas will have a conventional pancreatic carcinoma (PC) even if pathognomonic features of pancreatic carcinomas are still lacking, while a small percentage of them may have an inflammatory pancreatic mass (IPM).

Although most patients with IPM have somewhat characteristic histories, such as alcohol abuse and previous episodes of pancreatitis, the differential diagnosis between IPM and PC remains a clinical dilemma. Moreover, if the IPM is caused by the autoimmune pancreatitis developed in the proximal pancreatic portion and is associated with obstruction of the common bile duct and/or main pancreatic duct, the clinical and radiological diagnosis is even more difficult. As a consequence, patients with the focal type of autoimmune pancreatitis often undergo…

### Accuracy and repeatability of automated injector versus manual administration of an MRI contrast agent-results of a laboratory study [^1172mFtD]. Investigative Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

All contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) procedures should include accurate and repeatable contrast agent administration. An accurate flow rate is most important for first-pass imaging such as MR angiography (MRA) and time-resolved imaging such as hepatic arterial phase measurements. These procedures require a precise synchronization of contrast agent arrival in the target region and the MRI acquisition. This is especially relevant for low-dose contrast agent injection procedures, where the flow rate should be well defined and standardized.

Magnetic resonance contrast agents can be injected manually or by using an automated injection system. Depending on the patient's characteristics, the indication for the imaging, and the contrast agent, different contrast volumes are to be injected at different injection rates using needles or catheters with different diameters. To achieve reproducible, high-quality imaging data, accurate and reproducible flow rates and a short interval between contrast injection and saline chaser should be a goal. To the best of our knowledge, a thorough head-to-head comparison of injection parameters of injector versus manual administration of an MRI contrast agent has not been performed so far.

The primary goal of this study was to record flow rates of an MRI contrast agent achieved by use of an automated injection system versus manual administration over time and to calculate the deviations from the target flow rate.

### Anaphylaxis in the radiology suite [^113R7QEJ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). Low credibility.

Contrast media are crucial for modern medical imaging, and these agents are generally well tolerated. However, patients may experience adverse reactions, which can be categorized as either pharmacological effects or hypersensitivity reactions. Here, we present a vignette of a patient with a history of urticaria following radiocontrast media exposure during coronary angiography. The patient returns for evaluation and requires another coronary angiography. Currently, there are no validated methods for predicting such reactions. The mechanisms underlying adverse contrast media reactions remain poorly understood. Due to the unknown contrast agent involved, the patient was successfully pretreated with corticosteroids and an H1 antihistamine.

### Outcomes in patients with known contrast allergy undergoing contrast-enhanced endourologic procedures: A retrospective cohort study [^1123FVQg]. Journal of Endourology (2021). Low credibility.

Intravenous (IV) administration of iodinated contrast agents carries the risk of allergic reaction; however, this risk is unclear with administration into the urinary tract. We sought to evaluate patients with known contrast, iodine, or shellfish allergies for allergic response when undergoing urologic imaging requiring intraluminal urinary tract contrast administration.

- **Materials and methods**: We retrospectively reviewed consecutive patients undergoing endourologic procedures from 2010 to 2015 at our institution. Clinical records were reviewed for demographics, medical history, allergies, procedure details, fluids administered, anesthetic and pharmacologic agents administered, and continuous monitoring parameters. Patients with known allergies to iodine, shellfish, and/or contrast were identified and evaluated for clinical or hemodynamic signs of allergy. A convenience sample of 50 patients without allergy history was used as a comparison group.

- **Results**: We identified 1405 procedures involving 1000 consecutive patients. Procedures included retrograde pyelograms and antegrade nephrostograms. Eighty-six cases involving 58 patients with contrast, iodine, or shellfish allergies were identified. Of those with contrast allergy history, 18 (20.1%) cases involved patients with a history of anaphylactic reaction. Of these, 11 (61%) received steroid prophylaxis. No patients in either group (allergy, no allergy) were identified as having an allergic reaction during the procedure. There were no statistically significant differences in intraoperative IV fluids (p = 0.931).

### Diagnostic endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography [^1124swxW]. Endoscopy (2001). Low credibility.

Since the introduction of magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), the focus in endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) has shifted from diagnosis to treatment, a change that has organizational implications in relation to teaching and providing access to ERCP. Most of last year's papers on ERCP described refinements of the technique and indication, tissue sampling, and efforts to reduce complications. Many studies compared MRCP with various other imaging methods and with histopathological findings. Bile duct stones and strictures are still the main target, but new entities for evaluation with MRCP have been found: primary sclerosing cholangitis, choledochal cysts, chronic pancreatitis, pancreatic injury, and postoperative abnormalities. Helical computed-tomographic cholangiography is still attracting some interest. This review closes with a comparison of ERCP with MRCP with regard to availability, legal aspects, operator-dependency, and cost-effectiveness.

### Reporting standards for primary sclerosing cholangitis using MRI and MR cholangiopancreatography: Guidelines from MR Working Group of the International Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis Study Group [^1144NyCM]. European Radiology (2022). High credibility.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder affecting the bile ducts. It is characterized by biliary strictures, progressive liver parenchymal fibrosis, and an increased risk of hepatobiliary malignancies, primarily cholangiocarcinoma (CCA). PSC may lead to portal hypertension, liver decompensation, and liver failure, with the potential need for liver transplantation. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) are considered the imaging standards for diagnosis and follow-up in PSC patients.

Currently, there are no universally accepted reporting standards and definitions for MRI/MRCP features. Controversies exist about the definition of a high-grade stricture, and there is no widely agreed-upon approach to their management. Members of the MRI Working Group of the International Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis Study Group (IPSCSG) sought to define terminologies and reporting standards for describing MRI/MRCP features. These standards would be applied to the diagnosis and surveillance of disease progression and potentially for evaluating treatment response in clinical trials.

In this extensive review, the technique of MRI/MRCP and the assessment of image quality for the evaluation of PSC are briefly described.

- **Definitions and terminologies**: The severity and length of strictures, duct wall thickening and hyperenhancement, and liver parenchyma signal intensity changes are outlined. As CCA is an important complication of PSC, standardized reporting criteria for CCA developing in PSC are summarized.

### Current role and future potential of magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography with an emphasis on incidental findings [^117UcAy3]. Clinical Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the incidence of relevant biliary and extrabiliary findings in patients undergoing magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP).

- **Materials and methods**: Three hundred eighty-four patients underwent 1.5-Tesla MRCP, and relevant biliary and extrabiliary findings were identified.

- **Results**: Four hundred twenty-two biliary findings were identified in 384 patients (75%; 1.1 per patient), while 95 patients were free of any relevant biliary findings (25%). Incidental extrabiliary findings were observed in 763 patients (1.98 per patient).

- **Conclusion**: Most of the findings can be diagnosed by MRCP, while others require further examination. Interdisciplinary involvement is recommended to optimize clinical categorization, management, and treatment of these incidental findings.

### Contrast media extravasation of computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging: Management guidelines for the radiologist [^1157NRy9]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Intravenous contrast administration has been of great importance in diagnostic radiology, but it is not without risks, either due to local and systemic allergic reactions or due to subcutaneous extravasation of contrast media. Subcutaneous contrast medium extravasation is an infrequent, yet well-recognized complication. However, most incidents are minor and can be managed conservatively, but there are a few cases that require immediate surgical intervention. This article discusses the risk factors, clinical manifestations, and conservative and surgical approaches of subcutaneous contrast media extravasation for both computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging.

### Predictors of abnormalities on magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography: Is there a role when the biliary tree is normal on previous imaging [^115URmsS]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Low credibility.

Transabdominal US is recognized as the gold standard first-line investigation as it is noninvasive, relatively inexpensive, and readily available. However, the findings are operator-dependent and, although it has a specificity of 1.00, the low sensitivity of 0.3 for identifying ductal stones means that as many as two of every three CBD stones are missed. All reports should comment on dilatation of the biliary system, even if it is negative. If there is further suspicion of ductal stones in cases with abnormal LFTs or a US-confirmed dilated CBD, an MRCP examination should be performed according to UK guidelines. Endoscopic US is also an accepted but invasive imaging modality, albeit with limited resources. Elevated serum bilirubin (> 20 µmol/L) and ALP (> 110 IU/L) reflect an obstructed biliary system. US is superior to CT and is an excellent initial imaging modality for suspected bile duct pathology; it allows appropriate selection of patients who may warrant an MRCP. Our study demonstrates that normal index imaging reduces the risk of an abnormal CBD on MRCP by 70%.

Over the past two decades, MRCP has become significantly more widespread as a fundamental imaging modality, providing an alternative to endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) for the investigation of both biliary and pancreatic disorders. The heavily T2-weighted images allow for images with high signal intensity to diagnose filling defects, strictures, or extraluminal compression. For this reason, it precludes unnecessary instrumentation of the ducts with ERCP if the findings are negative.

### Hepatobiliary anomalies associated with ABCB4/MDR3 deficiency in adults: A pictorial essay [^114jDfn6]. Insights into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Ultrasound/MRCP discrepancy in a 44-year-old man with LPAC syndrome: Transverse ultrasound shows typical comet-tail artefacts in the left lobe. The MRCP shows no sign of biliary stone (Fig. 1).

If endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) has been considered the "gold standard" for diagnosing bile duct stones, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is a non-invasive alternative technique. It has been shown to be equivalent to ERCP in choledocholithiasis diagnosis and superior to ERCP in intrahepatic lithiasis diagnosis. The diagnosis of biliary stone is based on the presence of round or oval-shaped signal voids in the lumen of the bile ducts on heavily T2-weighted sequences. However, it is occasionally difficult to diagnose stones when the surrounding liquid is not present. On T1-weighted sequences, stones present with spontaneous hyperintensity. Recently, studies have shown the superiority of these sequences over the T2-weighted sequences for detecting biliary stones. Discrepancies between MR and ultrasound have been reported, as MR is not able to detect very small stones, while ultrasound may be suboptimal in cases of massive intraluminal stones. A complementary exploration by ultrasound and MR is recommended.

### Diagnostic yield of secretin-enhanced magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography in the investigation of patients with acalculous biliary pain [^111EjxMN]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

The diagnostic discrepancies identified in this study between MRCP and EUS regarding identifying pancreatic ductal abnormalities have been reported previously. One study reported a 40% discordance between S-MRCP and secretin enhanced findings. This high rate of discordance in these two different diagnostic modalities can be partially explained by differences in the imaging modalities. While MRCP images the entire pancreatic ductal system at the same time, EUS gives better enhanced morphology of sections of the pancreatic duct where the endoscope can be kept in the same position to allow accurate repeat measurements of the pancreatic duct diameter.

In the cohort, in patients who had a normal EUS, S-MRCP was able to identify significant pathology in 54% of patients, with over half of these having obstruction at the level of ampulla or in the proximal pancreatic duct. On the contrary, in patients who had a normal S-MRCP (n = 58), while a majority had either a normal EUS or EUS not performed (n = 43), the most common abnormality reported on EUS was pancreatitis or cysts (n = 10). This again indicates that S-MRCP has a good negative predictive value for pancreatic duct abnormalities, but EUS is better than S-MRCP in identifying parenchymal abnormalities within the pancreas.

### Diagnostic yield of secretin-enhanced magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography in the investigation of patients with acalculous biliary pain [^112msp2Y]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Secretin-enhanced magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (S-MRCP) facilitates better visualization of the pancreaticobiliary ductal system, but its role in patients with acalculous biliary pain (ABP) is yet to be established. The aim of this study was to assess the diagnostic yield and the role of S-MRCP in the investigation of ABP patients.

- **Methods**: This is a retrospective analysis of patients who had S-MRCP to investigate ABP over a 5-year period from June 2008 to May 2013. The findings and diagnosis as reported in the S-MRCP were compared with the findings on MRCP. The primary endpoint was the diagnostic yield of S-MRCP in ABP patients.

- **Results**: A total of 117 patients with ABP [28 (24%) male] had S-MRCP during the study period. The most common abnormality identified was obstruction at the level of the ampulla or in the proximal pancreatic duct. S-MRCP was able to identify significant pathological findings in 8 of 34 (22%) patients in whom MRCP did not detect any abnormality. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) was performed in 67% of patients. S-MRCP identified abnormalities in 21 of 41 (54%) patients who had a normal EUS.

- **Conclusions**: We conclude that the diagnostic yield of S-MRCP for recognizing anatomical variants of the pancreatic ductal system, in particular ampullary or proximal pancreatic duct stricture, is better than MRCP and EUS. These findings reflect the dynamic nature of S-MRCP and its complementary role alongside MRCP, EUS, and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in ABP patients.

Non-contrast magnetic resonance (MR) angiography and MR venography techniques are gaining popularity for vascular imaging because they are faster, more forgiving, and less costly compared with contrast-enhanced MR angiography. Non-contrast MR angiography also avoids gadolinium deposition, which is especially important in imaging children. Non-contrast MR angiography has an array of specific applications for numerous clinical indications. This review summarizes the non-contrast MR angiography methods and their relative advantages and disadvantages.

### Can gadolinium contrast agents be replaced with saline for direct MR arthrography of the hip? A pilot study with arthroscopic comparison [^113rRPP5]. European Radiology (2023). High credibility.

Direct magnetic resonance arthrography (MRA) of the hip is widely considered the diagnostic gold standard for detecting intra-articular lesions in patients with hip deformities such as hip dysplasia or femoroacetabular impingement (FAI). The desired effect of joint distension is usually achieved with the intra-articular injection of highly diluted gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCA). This procedure is reportedly safe, as it is associated with minimal postprocedural pain secondary to an inflammatory response to the contrast agent, and rarely leads to allergic reactions.

There has been mounting evidence that GBCA administration at systemic levels leads to gadolinium deposition in the body. Yet, at the time of writing, GBCA deposition on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has not been reported in the two studies where MRI was performed subsequent to intra-articular injection of highly diluted GBCA. There has been controversy surrounding potentially chondrotoxic effects related to the intra-articular injection of GBCA. Coupled with the costs of GBCA, patient concerns exist, which can lead to prolonged preprocedural informed consent consultations. Furthermore, reducing costs and patient concerns, along with improving patient safety, would yield medical and economic benefits alike.

Previously, the suitability of alternative agents for direct MRA, mostly using physiologic saline solutions, has been evaluated for the shoulder and the elbow. Comparable diagnostic accuracy in detecting rotator cuff and glenoid labrum lesions was reported for saline and GBCA-MRA of the shoulder.

Hydrate patients before and after administration of Omnipaque injection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

- **Techniques and conditions**: Use aseptic technique for all handling and administration of Omnipaque injection. Administer Omnipaque injection at either body (37°C, 98.6°F) or room temperature (20°C to 25°C, 68°F to 77°F). Do not mix Omnipaque injection with, or inject in intravenous lines containing, other drugs or total nutritional admixtures except when Omnipaque injection is administered in an automated contrast injection system or contrast management system suitable for simultaneous injection of Omnipaque injection and 0.9% sodium chloride injection [see Dosage and Administration (2.10, 2.11)]. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever the solution and container permit.

### Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography with compressed sensing at 1.5 T: Clinical application for the evaluation of branch duct IPMN of the pancreas [^112v71EA]. European Radiology (2020). Low credibility.

Tokoro et al. found that the BH CS-MRCP sequence adds value to standard NT MRCP because it compensates for the image deterioration seen in NT MRCP. Specifically, they observed clinically inadequate image quality in 43 out of 113 cases with NT MRCP, where the image quality in 13 of those 43 cases could be improved to clinically adequate by incorporating the BH CS-MRCP sequence.

Image reconstruction for the CS sequences is generally prolonged, taking approximately 5 minutes. By integrating the CS sequences as the last step in our standard protocol, the time taken for patient change was utilized for reconstruction without delaying the routine workflow. However, this approach did not allow for image quality checks or reruns of the sequence, as the images were only available when the next patient was already in the examination room. The time required for image reconstruction was not further evaluated in our study, as our MR scanner was equipped with standard hardware not optimized for demanding compressed sensing applications.

There are limitations to this study. First, it is a retrospective study. Second, there was no correlation with concrete pathology; for example, the diagnosis of BD-IPMN was not further assessed nor was there any correlation with other diagnostic procedures. The aim was to identify an ideal sequence and compare the performance among several sequences. Third, we lacked records of patient cooperation, which might be relevant as we hypothesized that age could be a significant factor affecting image quality, a hypothesis that was neither proven nor correlated with general conditions.

### Use of magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography in clinical practice: Not as good as we once thought [^1135kGs6]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2015). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is believed to be a useful tool to evaluate the biliary tree and pancreas for stones, tumors, or injuries to the ductile system. The purpose of this study was to compare the accuracy of MRCP to the gold standard, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), in our institution.

- **Study design**: We performed a retrospective review of all MRCPs followed by ERCPs (follow-on ERCP) at a single institution over a 6-year period. Exam findings from MRCP were compared with findings on the follow-on ERCP. Studies were grouped into two main classifications: tests being performed for patients with suspected choledocholithiasis (stone disease) and tests being performed for concerns of malignant strictures or duct injuries (non-stone disease).

- **Results**: A total of 81 patients had MRCPs and follow-on ERCPs in this time period. Thirty-six patients had positive findings on MRCP and ERCP for stones in the common duct system, and 14 patients had positive findings on MRCP and subsequent ERCP for masses and strictures of the common duct. Three patients had positive MRCP and ERCP findings for pancreatic duct abnormalities. The specificity and positive predictive value of MRCP were 94% and 98%, respectively. However, 13 of 28 patients had lesions identified on ERCP following a normal MRCP. The sensitivity and negative predictive value were 80% and 54%, respectively.

- **Conclusions**: Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography was not useful in the management algorithm of either stone or non-stone disease of the biliary tree.

### Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography in the diagnosis of primary sclerosing cholangitis [^111k7Z9a]. Endoscopy (2008). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is a less-invasive alternative to endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) for the diagnosis of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of MRCP in PSC compared with ERCP and to assess the diagnostic accuracy of different T2-weighted sequences.

- **Patients and methods**: Ninety-five patients (69 with PSC, 26 controls) were evaluated using both ERCP and MRCP. Exclusion criteria included secondary sclerosing cholangitis and contraindications to MRCP. PSC was confirmed in 69 patients using ERCP as the reference gold standard. MRCP was performed using a 1.5 Tesla MR unit, utilizing breath-hold, coronal and transverse half-Fourier acquisition single-shot turbo spin-echo (HASTE), coronal-oblique fat-suppressed half-Fourier rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement (RARE), and coronal-oblique fat-suppressed multisection thin-section HASTE (TS-HASTE) sequences. The MRCP morphological criteria of PSC were evaluated and compared with ERCP.

- **Results**: The sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy were 86%, 77%, and 83%, respectively, using the MRCP-RARE sequence, increasing further to 93%, 77%, and 88%, respectively, with the inclusion of follow-up MRCP in 52 patients conducted at 6–12 month intervals. HASTE and TS-HASTE sequences demonstrated significantly lower diagnostic accuracy but provided additional morphologic information.

- **Conclusions**: While MRCP can diagnose PSC, it encounters challenges in early PSC and cirrhosis and in differentiating cholangitis.

### MR colonography: current status [^111aKpyX]. European Radiology (2006). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance colonography (MRC) has gained access into clinical routine as a means for the assessment of the large bowel. There are widely accepted indications for MRC, especially in patients with incomplete conventional colonoscopy. Furthermore, virtual MRC is increasingly propagated as a screening tool, with advantages particularly inherent to the non-invasive nature of this procedure and the absence of ionizing radiation exposure. Beyond having sufficiently high diagnostic accuracy, exceptional patient acceptance is a major advantage of MRC as a diagnostic modality. This review article describes indications, techniques, and clinical outcomes of MRC approaches. Additionally, the impact of fecal tagging concepts is discussed.

### Duodeno-pancreatic and extrahepatic biliary tree trauma: WSES-AAST guidelines [^113piXjB]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for pancreatic trauma, specifically with respect to MRCP, the AAST/WSES 2019 guidelines recommend considering MRCP as a second-line noninvasive diagnostic modality to definitively rule out pancreatic parenchymal and pancreatic ductal injuries. It is advised to obtain MRCP with hepatobiliary contrast for diagnosing suspected biliary injuries.

### Risk of hypersensitivity reactions to iopromide after intra-arterial versus intravenous administration: A nested case-control analysis of 133,331 patients [^115U3Tts]. Investigative Radiology (2020). Low credibility.

Iopromide (Ultravist) is a low osmolar nonionic contrast medium containing iodine, which causes x-ray attenuation in computed tomography (CT) examinations. Iopromide has been used for contrast-enhanced CT and other radiographic procedures since 1985. As of July 2018, approximately 260 million doses (≈16 million doses/year) have been administered to patients in more than 100 countries. The overall safety has been proven in numerous studies.

Although the overall safety profile of iopromide and other nonionic/low osmolar iodine-based contrast media (IBCM) is well understood, there is a continuous discussion pertaining to the nature of hypersensitivity reactions. Hypersensitivity reactions, also called "immediate hypersensitivity reactions", "allergy-like reactions", "allergic-like reactions", "anaphylactoid reactions", "idiosyncratic", or "nonallergic contrast material–induced hypersensitivity, non–IgE-mediated allergy", are unpredictable and are potentially very severe or even lethal.

The majority of published studies investigated overall safety data on procedures with intravenous (IV) contrast administration. However, there is some evidence pointing to the fact that IV and intra-arterial (IA) administration might have different safety profiles. Such differences in the overall incidence of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) have been published by a few authors. However, to the best of our knowledge, no study specifically focuses on clinically relevant hypersensitivity reactions after IV versus IA administration.

An initial hypothesis on the pathomechanism of these potential reactions is still under investigation.

### ESR essentials: gadolinium-wise MRI-practice recommendations by the European Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine and Biology [^112fYq9b]. European Radiology (2025). Low credibility.

For safety procedures regarding the use of gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs), refer to ESUR-CMSC guidelines. In addition to single-patient safety, the choice of intravenous injection of GBCA in radiology should also consider MRI cost-effectiveness, MRI access to the patient community, and environmental impact. Multi-society joint statements and cooperative actions are recommended to raise awareness about the consequences of inefficient use of GBCA. Evidence level is low, based on expert opinions and recommendations; in vitro research is available and further investigation is necessary.

Use of GBCAs is justified only when appropriate or when it can potentially influence clinical decisions, based on the patient's history and pre-MRI clinical assessment. Evidence level is moderate, with several recommendations existing, though further research is needed to increase confidence.

- **GBCA standard doses**: The standard dose is 0.1 mmol/kg body weight for most applications using gadobutrol, gadoterate meglumine, and gadoteridol. For liver imaging using gadobenate dimeglumine, 0.05 mmol/kg body weight is recommended, and for liver imaging using gadoxetate disodium, 0.025 mmol/kg body weight is suggested. Dose optimization is recommended, as administering a lower-than-standard dose can still provide equally effective diagnostic information. Virtual contrast-enhancement with zero-dose is unlikely to reflect pharmacokinetic events. Evidence level is moderate; further research is necessary as lowering the dose can still affect diagnostic yield under specific circumstances.

Next-generation GBCAs have been developed to succeed current limitations in clinical practice.

### Haemobilia causing acute pancreatitis after percutaneous liver biopsy: Diagnosis by magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography [^1179Wuuc]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2001). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) has garnered significant attention as a non-invasive alternative to endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, primarily for the investigation of choledocholithiasis and the evaluation of less common biliary anomalies. We present a case of haemobilia causing acute pancreatitis following a percutaneous liver biopsy, where the diagnosis was clearly established using MRCP, thereby avoiding the need for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and sphincterotomy.

### ESR essentials: diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma-practice recommendations by ESGAR [^11431mHN]. European Radiology (2024). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma can be made on different imaging exams acquired with the intravenous administration of contrast agents, including computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or sometimes contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS). In patients with liver cirrhosis or other high-risk factors, hepatic lesions with typical imaging characteristics can be diagnosed as hepatocellular carcinoma without the need for additional exams. Hepatic lesions with atypical imaging characteristics may require further imaging exams, follow-up over time, or histopathological analysis with biopsy of the lesion. The management of hepatocellular carcinoma is often discussed at multidisciplinary meetings to choose the most appropriate treatment.

### Endoscopic ultrasound versus magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography for common bile duct stones [^115MdkHe]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). High credibility.

Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) are diagnostic tests for common bile duct stones in patients who are suspected of having these stones before undergoing invasive treatment. There has been no systematic review of the accuracy of EUS and MRCP in diagnosing common bile duct stones using appropriate reference standards.

- **Objectives**: To determine and compare the accuracy of EUS and MRCP for the diagnosis of common bile duct stones.

- **Search methods**: We searched databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded, BIOSIS, and ClinicalTrials.gov until September 2012. Additionally, we searched references from included studies to identify further studies and reviews from various databases such as the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), Health Technology Assessment (HTA), Medion, and the Aggressive Research Intelligence Facility (ARIF). There were no restrictions based on language, publication status, or whether data were collected prospectively or retrospectively.

- **Selection criteria**: We included studies that provided data on the number of true positives, false positives, false negatives, and true negatives for EUS or MRCP. Studies were only accepted if they confirmed the presence of common bile duct stones by their extraction (via surgical or endoscopic methods) for a positive test, or the absence of stones through negative surgical or endoscopic exploration of the common bile duct or symptom-free follow-up for at least six months for a negative test.

### Gadolinium as an alternative contrast agent for therapeutic ERCP in the iodine-allergic patient [^116iRpCC]. Endoscopy (2009). Low credibility.

The performance of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) requires an intraductal contrast agent, typically an iodine-based agent. Alternatives for patients with a severe allergy to iodinated contrast agents are limited. We conducted a retrospective review to evaluate the success and safety of gadolinium as an alternative radiocontrast agent in iodine-allergic patients. This study encompassed five patients at a tertiary care pancreaticobiliary referral center, each undergoing a total of six ERCP procedures using a gadolinium chelate as the radiocontrast agent. ERCP was technically successful in all cases, including pancreatic endotherapy, without any contrast-related adverse reactions. It is concluded that gadolinium is a reasonable alternative to iodine-based ERCP contrast in selected patients. Although gadolinium provides inferior image quality compared to standard iodine-based contrast, it was not technically limiting in our small experience.

### Urgent MRI with MR cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) of acute cholecystitis and related complications: Diagnostic role and spectrum of imaging findings [^114fSi1j]. Emergency Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Acute cholecystitis, which is usually associated with gallstones, is one of the most common surgical causes of emergency hospital admission and may be further complicated by mural necrosis, perforation, and abscess formation. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is increasingly available in the emergency setting. Technically improved equipment and faster acquisition protocols allow excellent tissue contrast, and MRI is now an attractive modality for imaging acute abdominal disorders.

Use of MRI with MR cholangiopancreatography in the emergency setting provides rapid, noninvasive, and confident diagnosis or exclusion of acute cholecystitis and coexistent choledocholithiasis. To familiarize the reader with these cross-sectional imaging appearances, this paper reviews MRI findings consistent with uncomplicated cholecystitis. These include gallbladder distension, intraluminal sludge and gallstones, impacted stones obstructing the gallbladder neck or cystic duct, thickening of the gallbladder wall, abnormal signal intensity, edematous stratification, and pericholecystic and perihepatic fluid. Increased enhancement of the gallbladder wall and adjacent liver parenchyma is observed when intravenous paramagnetic contrast is used.

Furthermore, MRI allows prompt detection and comprehensive visualization and characterization of cholecystitis-related complications such as gangrene, perforation, pericholecystic abscess, and intrahepatic fistulization. Some previous literature reports, and our experience, suggest that when available, MRI should be recommended to provide prompt and efficient diagnosis.

### Consensus report from the 9international forum for liver magnetic resonance imaging: Applications of gadoxetic acid-enhanced imaging [^116nVx9B]. European Radiology (2021). Low credibility.

T1W MRC can be useful for the visualization of non-dilated ducts. Biliary visualization was assessed in 29 right liver donors using four techniques: 3D T2W MRCP, 2D T2W MRCP, breath-hold T1W hepatobiliary MRC (BH T1W MRC), and high-resolution 3D T1W hepatobiliary MR (Nav T1 MRC) using gadoxetic acid. Both BH T1 MRC and Nav T1 MRC improved the accuracy of visualization and specificity of biliary diagnosis when added to 3D/2D T2W MRCP in 29 living liver donors. The Nav T1 MRC set using gadoxetic acid showed the highest diagnostic confidence and visualization scores for branching and overall ducts.

In another study on living liver donors, gadoxetic acid–enhanced isotropic high-resolution (IHR) 3D T1W MRC was compared to 3D multi-slice T2W MRCP for the evaluation of biliary anatomy. IHR-T1W-MRC provided significantly improved visibility and sharpness of all evaluated intrahepatic bile ducts compared with 3D T2W MRCP (all p < 0.05), as well as higher overall image quality (p < 0.01). IHR-T1W-MRC also demonstrated significantly higher agreement with the reference standard than 3D T2W MRCP in bile duct variation (88% vs. 81%; p = 0.03) and expected bile duct openings (77% vs. 70%; p = 0.006).

Gadoxetic acid–enhanced MRI features were investigated for their ability to diagnose cystic fibrosis (CF)-associated liver disease (CFLD) in 50 CF patients and 40 controls. Three imaging descriptors distinguished CFLD from controls: altered gallbladder morphology, periportal tracking, and periportal fat deposition. Prospective validation of this classification algorithm showed 94% sensitivity and 85% specificity.

### Updated guidelines for intravenous contrast use for CT and MRI [^116hMRGY]. Emergency Radiology (2020). Low credibility.

Intravenous (IV) contrast material is used extensively for CT and MRI scans in emergency departments (ED). Its use is essential for making many critical diagnoses in ED patients. While adverse reactions can occur, newer research has enhanced our understanding of IV contrast media tolerance and safety, leading to improved and more liberal guidelines for intravenous contrast use.

This review article outlines how intravenous contrast can be used safely in more patients, more expeditiously, and with fewer precautions than previous guidelines. It explains the basis for the new recommendations for intravenous contrast material use and describes the indicated precautions and preparations to avoid adverse reactions with iodinated agents used for CT and gadolinium agents for MRI.

### Safety issues related to intravenous contrast agent use in magnetic resonance imaging [^114yyFUX]. Pediatric Radiology (2021). Low credibility.

Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) have been used to improve the image quality of MRI examinations for decades and have an excellent overall safety record. However, there are well-documented risks associated with GBCAs, and our understanding and management of these risks continue to evolve. The purpose of this review is to discuss the safety of GBCAs used in MRI in both adult and pediatric populations. Particular attention is focused on acute adverse reactions, nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, and gadolinium deposition. The non-GBCA MRI contrast agent ferumoxytol, which is increasing in use and has its own risk profile, is also discussed. Finally, special populations at higher risk of harm from GBCA administration are identified.
