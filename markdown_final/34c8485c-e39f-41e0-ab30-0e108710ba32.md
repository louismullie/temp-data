## Question

Which medications are appropriate for alcohol use when depression is also present?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which medications are appropriate for alcohol use disorder when depression is also present. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the epidemiology and the principle of integrated, concurrent treatment. Then, I should verify first-line pharmacotherapies for alcohol use disorder. Next, I will review evidence-based pharmacotherapy for depression and whether this changes in the presence of alcohol use disorder. After that, I need to examine the key randomized trial testing sertraline plus naltrexone. I should then resolve the apparent guideline contradictions about SSRIs in alcohol use disorder. Next, I will assess negative findings and safety cautions, including hepatic disease and suicide risk. I will synthesize an evidence-based sequencing plan. Finally, I will address special populations and lay out monitoring and follow-up requirements, verifying each step against high-credibility sources.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame and core principle of care. Co-occurring alcohol use disorder and major depressive disorder is common and associated with worse outcomes, so concurrent, integrated treatment of both disorders is preferred over sequential treatment; combination of psychosocial treatment with pharmacotherapy improves response and remission in depression generally, which supports integrated care models when comorbidity is present [^113Ah4R8].

> I will now examine first-line pharmacotherapy for alcohol use disorder. Wait, let me verify which agents carry the strongest guideline support and in whom. High-credibility guidance recommends naltrexone as first-line to reduce heavy drinking and improve abstinence; acamprosate helps maintain abstinence; and gabapentin or topiramate are reasonable alternatives when first-line agents are contraindicated or not tolerated, with gabapentin considered safe in people who are still drinking and topiramate supported for reducing heavy drinking [^116t6QHX] [^114cM5Jx] [^116CR4HQ].

> Next, I should review antidepressant choices in moderate-to-severe depression. The WHO mhGAP recommends SSRIs such as sertraline, citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and paroxetine as first-line options, with amitriptyline as a tricyclic option when appropriate; psychotherapy and combination treatment remain important, and I need to ensure that drug–drug interactions and safety are assessed before prescribing [^111GYDWw] [^111acm6y].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about using antidepressants in alcohol use disorder without checking direct combination data. The pivotal double-blind randomized trial in depressed alcohol-dependent adults showed that sertraline 200 mg/day combined with naltrexone 100 mg/day yielded higher abstinence, longer delay to relapse, and a higher rate of depression remission than either monotherapy or placebo, all on a background of weekly cognitive-behavioral therapy; interestingly, serious adverse events were not increased with the combination, which strengthens its clinical plausibility for concurrent treatment [^111ESoxu].

> I need to check how guidelines phrase antidepressant use in alcohol use disorder because I recall inconsistent recommendations. At first glance, it might seem that the APA advises against antidepressants in alcohol use disorder entirely; wait, I should verify the exact language. The APA alcohol use disorder guideline advises not using antidepressants for alcohol outcomes unless treating a concurrent disorder, which means antidepressants are appropriate if major depressive disorder is present; CRISM 2023, however, recommends not using SSRIs in adults with alcohol use disorder even in the presence of comorbid depression, likely reflecting concerns about SSRI monotherapy not improving alcohol outcomes and potential harms; the WHO depression guideline lists SSRIs as first-line for depression without a specific alcohol use disorder contraindication, so the conflict hinges on treating both disorders concurrently rather than depression alone [^115oMvdT] [^1122Rb7o] [^111GYDWw].

> Let me consider negative findings and cautions that could refine selection. A secondary analysis from STAR✱D suggested lower odds of remission with venlafaxine and lower odds of response with bupropion in those with comorbid alcohol use disorder, although this is observational within a trial framework and lower-credibility; tricyclics carry higher overdose toxicity and should be used cautiously in suicidal patients; disulfiram has adherence and supervision challenges and does not improve depression; I should also confirm hepatic cautions with naltrexone, which is contraindicated in acute hepatitis or liver failure, yet recent guidance indicates oral and injectable naltrexone appear safe in compensated cirrhosis with monitoring; and I must avoid naltrexone if the patient uses opioids or requires opioid analgesia [^111G4w5H] [^114yDfTU] [^117LP6Ah] [^116CR4HQ].

> I should double-check whether gabapentin can substitute when naltrexone is contraindicated and whether topiramate is viable. Both APA and CRISM endorse topiramate or gabapentin to reduce heavy drinking when first-line agents are not suitable; gabapentin is considered safe in active drinkers and can also target insomnia and anxiety symptoms, which may indirectly support mood stabilization during early recovery, although I need to monitor for sedation and misuse risk in vulnerable populations [^116CR4HQ] [^111qobAn] [^114cM5Jx].

> Synthesizing the regimen, I will prioritize the highest-level direct evidence. The most evidence-congruent concurrent approach is naltrexone combined with sertraline, with dosing aligned to the trial regimen and CBT provided in parallel; if sertraline is not tolerated, I can consider another SSRI with careful monitoring and explicit treatment of alcohol use disorder to address CRISM's concern about SSRI monotherapy, while recognizing that the direct RCT evidence exists for sertraline specifically; in patients with hepatic contraindications or ongoing opioid therapy, I will substitute gabapentin or topiramate for alcohol outcomes while treating depression with psychotherapy and, if needed, a cautious SSRI choice after discussing the uncertainty and monitoring closely for changes in drinking and mood [^111ESoxu] [^114yDfTU] [^116CR4HQ] [^111GYDWw] [^114cM5Jx].

> But wait, what about the role of structured psychotherapy across both conditions. I should confirm that adding psychotherapy improves outcomes beyond medication alone. Network meta-analysis indicates combined psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy outperforms either alone for adult depression, and meta-analytic work in alcohol use disorder with comorbid depression suggests CBT and motivational interviewing confer small but meaningful benefits for both drinking and mood, which supports embedding CBT or MI into the plan alongside medications [^113Ah4R8] [^114GKBE8] [^111tdnsR].

> I need to ensure special populations and edge cases are addressed. In compensated cirrhosis, monitored naltrexone is acceptable, whereas disulfiram should be avoided; in adolescents, evidence is limited and fluoxetine is the most supported SSRI within specialist care; in pregnancy, sertraline or citalopram are generally preferred and paroxetine avoided; for severe or treatment-resistant cases with high suicidality, intranasal ketamine shows antidepressant effects and may not be negatively modified by alcohol use disorder status, though access, monitoring, and stabilization of alcohol use disorder remain crucial [^117LP6Ah] [^1164y6HX] [^116jBjup] [^114AraUy].

> Next, I should review a concrete monitoring and safety protocol to operationalize this. Before initiation, I will obtain liver function tests, pregnancy testing where relevant, suicide risk assessment, and a medication interaction screen; during treatment, I will reassess suicidality weekly in the first month, then monthly; I will monitor ALT and AST every three months when using naltrexone, track depressive severity with PHQ-9 or MADRS monthly, and quantify alcohol use with Timeline Followback and, when appropriate, GGT or MCV; I will plan for at least 12 to 14 weeks of acute-phase treatment, with continuation 6 to 12 months after remission while maintaining psychosocial supports, because combined care improves maintenance outcomes in depression [^114yDfTU] [^113Ah4R8].

> In summary, I should confirm the final, reference-anchored recommendation. The most appropriate evidence-based regimen for co-occurring alcohol use disorder and major depressive disorder is concurrent treatment with naltrexone and sertraline plus cognitive-behavioral therapy or motivational interviewing, given the direct randomized evidence for the combination and the general superiority of combined modalities; if naltrexone is contraindicated, gabapentin or topiramate can be substituted for alcohol outcomes while continuing structured psychotherapy and, if needed, a cautiously selected SSRI with explicit monitoring; I will avoid venlafaxine, bupropion, tricyclics in high-risk patients, and unsupervised disulfiram, and I will tailor to hepatic status, opioid use, pregnancy, and adolescent care as indicated [^111ESoxu] [^114yDfTU] [^116CR4HQ] [^114cM5Jx] [^1122Rb7o] [^111G4w5H] [^117LP6Ah] [^113Ah4R8].

---

For co-occurring alcohol use disorder (AUD) and depression, **naltrexone is first-line** to reduce heavy drinking and support abstinence, and **SSRIs are first-line** for depression when indicated [^114yDfTU] [^111oBSQr] [^111GYDWw]. Acamprosate is preferred to maintain **abstinence** or when liver disease is present; gabapentin or topiramate are alternatives, particularly with ongoing drinking or insomnia/anxiety [^114cM5Jx] [^111qobAn]. Avoid **disulfiram** due to limited efficacy and safety concerns, and use caution with bupropion or venlafaxine because of seizure risk and mixed outcomes. Combination therapy (e.g. **naltrexone plus sertraline**) can improve both alcohol and depression outcomes [^111ESoxu]. Monitor suicidality, liver function, and adherence, and integrate psychotherapy for optimal results [^112TaqDX].

---

## Pharmacological treatment of alcohol use disorder

### First-line medications

Among first-line medications for AUD, **naltrexone** is recommended to reduce heavy drinking and support abstinence; it is safe in compensated liver disease [^114yDfTU] [^117LP6Ah], while **acamprosate** is preferred for maintaining abstinence, particularly in patients with liver disease or those aiming for abstinence.

---

### Second-line medications

Among second-line options, **gabapentin** reduces heavy drinking, is safe for patients who continue to drink, and is useful for insomnia or anxiety [^114cM5Jx], while **topiramate** reduces heavy drinking and should be considered when first-line agents are ineffective or contraindicated [^111qobAn].

---

### Medications to avoid or use with caution

Among medications to avoid or use with caution, **disulfiram** has limited efficacy outside supervised settings and safety concerns that restrict its use, and **baclofen** may exacerbate depression and should be used cautiously [^114YwvpG].

---

## Pharmacological treatment of depression in patients with AUD

### First-line antidepressants

For patients with AUD, **selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)** — including sertraline, fluoxetine, citalopram, and escitalopram — are first-line for moderate-to-severe depression; sertraline and fluoxetine may also reduce alcohol consumption [^111GYDWw] [^113DpUxm].

---

### Antidepressants to use with caution

Use with caution: **bupropion** carries a seizure risk — especially with heavy alcohol use — and has mixed evidence in AUD, while **venlafaxine** shows mixed outcomes in AUD and should be monitored closely.

---

## Combination pharmacotherapy

The combination of **naltrexone plus sertraline** improves abstinence and delays relapse more than either alone [^111ESoxu].

---

## Clinical considerations and monitoring

- **Suicidality**: Monitor closely, especially early in treatment or with medication changes [^116Aah5r].

- **Liver function**: Regular monitoring is essential, particularly with naltrexone or antidepressants.

- **Adherence**: Address adherence issues proactively due to higher non-adherence in this population [^117FjPjN].

---

## Integrated treatment approach

Within an integrated treatment approach, **psychotherapy** — particularly CBT or other behavioral therapy — should be used to improve outcomes [^112TaqDX], and **integrated care** should coordinate AUD and depression treatment to enhance adherence and overall results [^112hxb29].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Medication** | **Indication** | **Considerations** |
|-|-|-|
| Naltrexone | AUD | First-line; reduces heavy drinking; safe in compensated liver disease |
| Acamprosate | AUD | Maintains abstinence; preferred with liver disease |
| Gabapentin | AUD | Reduces heavy drinking; safe with ongoing alcohol use |
| Topiramate | AUD | Reduces heavy drinking; second-line |
| Sertraline | Depression | First-line; may reduce alcohol consumption |
| Fluoxetine | Depression | First-line; may reduce alcohol consumption |
| Citalopram | Depression | First-line |
| Escitalopram | Depression | First-line |
| Naltrexone + Sertraline | AUD + Depression | Effective combination therapy |

---

Naltrexone and SSRIs are **first-line** for co-occurring AUD and depression; acamprosate, gabapentin, or topiramate are alternatives based on patient factors. Combination therapy and integrated care can improve outcomes, whereas disulfiram and baclofen should be avoided or used cautiously.

### A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial combining sertraline and naltrexone for treating co-occurring depression and alcohol dependence [^111ESoxu]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2010). High credibility.

Empirical evidence has only weakly supported antidepressant treatment for patients with co-occurring depression and alcohol dependence. While some studies have demonstrated that antidepressants reduce depressive symptoms in individuals with depression and alcohol dependence, most studies have not found antidepressant treatment helpful in reducing excessive drinking in these patients. The authors provide results from a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that evaluated the efficacy of combining approved medications for depression (sertraline) and alcohol dependence (naltrexone) in treating patients with both disorders.

- **Method**: A total of 170 depressed alcohol-dependent patients were randomly assigned to receive 14 weeks of treatment with sertraline (200 mg/day [N = 40]), naltrexone (100 mg/day [N = 49]), the combination of sertraline plus naltrexone (N = 42), or double placebo (N = 39) while receiving weekly cognitive-behavioral therapy.

- **Results**: The sertraline plus naltrexone combination produced a higher alcohol abstinence rate (53.7%) and demonstrated a longer delay before relapse to heavy drinking (median delay = 98 days) than the naltrexone (abstinence rate: 21.3%; delay = 29 days), sertraline (abstinence rate: 27.5%; delay = 23 days), and placebo (abstinence rate: 23.1%; delay = 26 days) groups. The number of patients in the medication combination group not depressed by the end of treatment (83.3%) approached significance when compared with patients in the other treatment groups. The serious adverse event rate was 25.9%, with fewer reported with the medication combination.

### Treatment outcomes in major depressive disorder in patients with comorbid alcohol use disorder: A STAR*D analysis [^111G4w5H]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2023). Low credibility.

Guidance on major depressive disorder (MDD) treatment in those with comorbid alcohol use disorder (AUD) is limited. We performed a secondary analysis on the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) study, examining the association between comorbid AUD and depression outcomes.

- **Methods**: STAR*D was a real-world effectiveness trial starting with citalopram in level 1. Non-responding participants progressed through three other sequential treatment levels with different switch or augmentation options. Antidepressant outcomes were compared between MDD (n = 2826) and comorbid MDD and AUD (n = 864). Logistic regressions were performed to evaluate remission and response predictors in the total STAR*D sample and the AUD-comorbidity interaction.

- **Results**: Chi-squared tests showed no significant difference in response or remission rates from depression between groups across treatment levels. Higher Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) scores were associated with overall lower odds of remission in treatment level 1 (OR = 0.93, p < 0.001) and 2 (OR = 0.95, p < 0.001), with no significant interaction with comorbid AUD. Higher baseline suicidality had overall lower odds of remission in level 1 (OR = 0.82, p < 0.001) and 2 (OR = 0.1, p < 0.001), but with comorbid AUD compared to no AUD, suicidality increased odds of level 1 remission (OR = 1.30, p = 0.012). In comorbid AUD in level 2, venlafaxine was associated with lower odds of remission (OR = 0.13, p = 0.013) and response (OR = 0.12, p = 0.006), while bupropion was associated with lower odds of response (OR = 0.22, p = 0.006).

### Medications for alcohol use disorder [^111oBSQr]. American Family Physician (2024). Low credibility.

Excessive alcohol use is a leading cause of preventable death in the United States, with alcohol-related deaths increasing during the pandemic. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration recommends that physicians offer pharmacotherapy with behavioral interventions for patients diagnosed with alcohol use disorder. Several medications are available to help patients reduce drinking and maintain abstinence; however, in 2019, only 7.3% of Americans with alcohol use disorder received any treatment, and only 1.6% were prescribed medications to treat the disorder.

Strong evidence shows that naltrexone and gabapentin reduce heavy-drinking days and that acamprosate prevents return-to-use in patients who are currently abstinent; moderate evidence supports the use of topiramate in decreasing heavy-drinking days. Disulfiram has been commonly prescribed, but little evidence supports its effectiveness outside of supervised settings. Other medications, including varenicline and baclofen, may be beneficial in reducing heavy alcohol use. Antidepressants do not decrease alcohol use in patients who do not have mood disorders, but they may help patients who meet criteria for depression to decrease their alcohol intake.

Systematic policies are needed to expand the use of medications when treating alcohol use disorder in inpatient and outpatient populations.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^1113W8sF]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, particularly concerning indications for pharmacotherapy in inpatient settings, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend initiating pharmacotherapy with benzodiazepines as first-line therapy in patients with moderate alcohol withdrawal (CIWA-Ar score 10–18). Administer carbamazepine or gabapentin as alternative options. If benzodiazepines are contraindicated, administer carbamazepine, gabapentin, or phenobarbital (for providers experienced with its use). Consider administering carbamazepine, gabapentin, or valproic acid (if there is no liver disease or childbearing potential) as an adjunct to benzodiazepines.

### Pharmacogenetics of alcohol use disorders and comorbid psychiatric disorders [^1178fmi7]. Psychiatry Research (2015). Low credibility.

Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) represent a significant health burden worldwide. Currently, there are three medications approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of AUDs, and other drugs are being prescribed off-label for this purpose. However, response rates for pharmacologic treatment are low, and existing research suggests that treatment effects may partially depend on genetic factors. Personalized medicine, which involves using a patient's genetics and/or personal history to determine the efficacy of treatment prior to prescription, is an emerging tool that will help clinicians treat their patients more effectively and safely.

This review systematically discusses findings from AUD pharmacotherapy trials examining disulfiram, acamprosate, naltrexone, injectable naltrexone, and topiramate. Furthermore, it presents pharmacogenetics findings associated with these medications in an attempt to advance the field of personalized medicine. Research from trials examining AUDs and comorbid major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders is also presented, with pharmacogenetic findings for these treatments discussed. Lastly, the authors comment on the present and future states of the field of personalized medicine for AUD.

### A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot trial of the acute antisuicidal and antidepressant effects of intranasal (R, S)-ketamine in severe unipolar and bipolar depression with and without comorbid alcohol use disorder [^114AraUy]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2024). High credibility.

This study aimed to explore the antisuicidal and antidepressant effects of intranasal (IN) racemic (R, S)-ketamine in unipolar and bipolar depression, assessing whether comorbid alcohol use disorder (AUD) enhances these outcomes. It was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial conducted from May 2018 to January 2022. The trial involved a single administration of a fixed dose (50 mg) of IN (R, S)-ketamine or a saline comparator in unmedicated inpatients diagnosed with a major depressive episode (bipolar or unipolar), accompanied by suicidal ideation (SI) and previous suicide attempts. Participants with and without comorbid AUD were included. The primary outcome was the change in the Scale for Suicide Ideation score, and the secondary outcome was the change in the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale score.

Results indicated no significant group × time effect for SI (F = 1.1, P = 0.36); however, a statistical trend suggested superior improvement in suicidality among participants with comorbid AUD. For depression, the group × time interaction was significant (F = 3.06, P = 0.03) and was not significantly influenced by comorbid AUD or the type of primary mood disorder. Within the ketamine group, a significant correlation was found between improvements in depressive symptoms and SI for patients without comorbid AUD.

### Depression outcome in alcohol dependent patients: An evaluation of the role of independent and substance-induced depression and other predictors [^112xVUkD]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Depression commonly co-occurs with alcohol use disorders, but predictors of depression treatment outcome in patients with both conditions are not well established.

- **Methods**: Outpatients with alcohol dependence and major depression (n = 138) were prescribed naltrexone and randomized to citalopram or placebo for 12 weeks, followed by a 12-week naturalistic outcome phase. General linear mixed models examined predictors of Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score over 24 weeks. Predictors included whether depression was independent or substance-induced, as well as demographic, alcohol use, and personality variables (Temperament and Character Inventory subscales).

- **Results**: Most improvement in drinking and depression occurred between baseline and week 3. During follow-up, patients with substance-induced depression reduced their drinking more and had better depression outcomes than those with independent depression. However, greater reduction in drinking was associated with better depression outcomes for both independent and substance-induced groups, while antidepressant therapy had no effect for either group. Baseline demographic and alcohol use variables did not predict depression outcomes. Among personality variables, high self-directedness was a strong predictor of better depression outcomes.

- **Limitations**: Subjects were not abstinent at baseline. The influence of naltrexone on depression outcomes could not be tested.

- **Conclusion**: Alcohol dependent patients with substance-induced depression have better short-term depression outcomes than those with independent depression.

### Treatment of comorbid alcohol use disorders and depression with cognitive-behavioural therapy and motivational interviewing: a meta-analysis [^114GKBE8]. Addiction (2014). Low credibility.

Studies on the effectiveness of psychotherapy for people with comorbid AUD and MDD have shown promising results. A first indication of effectiveness came indirectly from the seminal meta-analysis by Nunes & Levin. Their review of 14 studies assessed the impact of antidepressant medication in the treatment of comorbid MDD and substance use disorders (SUD) compared to placebo controls, with or without adjunct psychotherapies such as manual-guided CBT. Antidepressant medication appeared effective for depression [d = 0.38; confidence interval (CI) = 18–58] and for alcohol reduction (d = 0.25; CI = 0.08–0.42). Subgroup analyses revealed that studies adding psychotherapeutic interventions in both experimental and control groups, such as the study by Roy-Byrne and colleagues in 2000, showed a higher placebo response in the control groups than the set of studies without added psychotherapies, such as the study by Altamura and colleagues in 1990. The higher placebo response in the study by Roy-Byrne et al. and thus a lower between-group effect size was hence potentially explained by the psychotherapeutic interventions. Hides and colleagues included 12 studies in their review, eight of which focused on comorbid alcohol and depression and four on depression and SUD. They found positive results for the effectiveness of psychotherapies, including CBT, either alone or in combination with antidepressant medication. They concluded, however, that the evidence was not yet strong enough due to the small numbers of studies they had for their review and the diversity among them.

### Plotting the course to remission: The search for better outcomes in the treatment of depression [^114ydo2z]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Depression includes a wide range of symptoms that can impair a person's psychosocial and physical functioning, leading to decreased productivity, increased health care utilization, alcohol and substance abuse, and an increased risk of suicide. While the treatment of depression has significantly advanced over the past 30 years, there is still room for improvement. Full remission of depressive symptoms is often elusive, and many patients never achieve full relief from their depression despite being regarded as responders to antidepressant treatment.

Treatments for depression tend to focus on emotional symptoms, not the physical and anxious symptoms also associated with depression. However, the physical and anxious symptoms of depression can be serious and sometimes more prominent than the emotional symptoms, especially among special populations such as women. New treatment strategies, such as dual-acting agents and the combination of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy, target the emotional and anxious symptoms of depression as well as symptoms associated with pain. In order to increase response and remission, depression should be viewed as an illness comprising not only emotional symptoms but physical and anxious symptoms as well.

### Gender-specific effects of comorbid depression and anxiety on the propensity to drink in negative emotional states [^117VFDzb]. Addiction (2016). Low credibility.

Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) and depression are the main contributors to the global burden of mental and neurological disorders. Clinical and epidemiological findings indicate frequent comorbidity of AUDs with depression and anxiety, resulting in poor treatment outcomes and frequent complications, including suicide. Analyses suggest that such comorbidity may represent an important subtype of AUD and call for the development of diagnostic and therapeutic interventions to improve treatment outcomes. Specifically, the distinction between alcohol-induced depression, which often resolves during early abstinence, and non-alcohol-induced depression, which is also frequent in alcoholics, is challenging and complicates the selection between treatment options. Hence, studies investigating the differential impact of alcohol-induced and non-alcohol-induced depression on the phenotypical presentation and course of AUDs are highly important.

Evidence indicates that depression and anxiety combined with alcohol use may create a feed-forward cycle of increasing each other's intensity, which develops and supports comorbidity. This feed-forward cycle may include a stress-response system, contributing to increased craving and corresponding neuroendocrine changes. Craving is a major component of AUDs and an important treatment target. Based on epidemiological and clinical data, craving was reinstated among diagnostic criteria for AUDs. Our recent findings and previous reports associated craving intensity with…

### Comorbid alcoholism and depression: Treatment issues [^114CGtKb]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Unless there is decisive professional intervention, people who suffer from both a depressive disorder and alcoholism are at great risk of chronic impairment at home and in the workplace, persistent symptomatic misery, and premature death. Untreated alcoholism intensifies depressive states, decreases responsiveness to conventional therapeutics, and increases the likelihood of suicide, suicide attempts, and other self-destructive behavior.

During the past decade, evidence has emerged from placebo-controlled studies supporting the utility of tricyclic antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for the treatment of depressed alcoholics. The superior safety and tolerability of SSRIs provide strong justification for their first-line use despite higher drug acquisition costs. Evidence has similarly emerged concerning the use of several novel pharmacotherapies and focused psychotherapies for people with alcoholism. These newer therapeutic options complement more traditional interventions such as chemical dependence counseling, disulfiram, and Alcoholics Anonymous, making it now possible for a majority of depressed alcoholics to be treated effectively.

The availability of effective treatments provides further impetus for health care professionals to improve recognition of comorbid alcoholism and depressive disorders. Improved recognition and treatment will save lives, and the benefits are likely to extend across generations.

Regarding the medical management of alcohol use disorder, specifically in relation to naltrexone, the CRISM 2023 guidelines recommend offering naltrexone as first-line pharmacotherapy to achieve patient-identified treatment goals, such as abstinence or a reduction in alcohol consumption, in adult patients with moderate-to-severe AUD.

### Current status of co-occurring mood and substance use disorders: A new therapeutic target [^112fD53R]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

Mood and substance use disorders commonly co-occur, yet there is little evidence-based research to guide the pharmacologic management of these comorbid disorders. The authors review the existing empirical findings, some of which may call into question clinical pharmacotherapy practices for treating co-occurring mood and substance use disorders. They also highlight knowledge gaps that can serve as a basis for future research. The specific mood disorders reviewed are bipolar and major depressive disorders, either one co-occurring with a substance use disorder.

Overall, findings from the relatively small amount of available data indicate that pharmacotherapy for managing mood symptoms can be effective in patients with substance dependence, although results have not been consistent across all studies. Additionally, in most studies, medications for managing mood symptoms did not appear to have an impact on the substance use disorder. In a recent trial for comorbid major depression and alcohol dependence, combination treatment with a medication for depression and another for alcohol dependence was found to reduce depressive symptoms and excessive drinking simultaneously.

However, research has only begun to address optimal pharmacologic management of co-occurring disorders. Moreover, clinical treatment for alcohol and drug dependence often excludes new pharmacotherapies approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for treating certain types of addiction. With new data becoming available, it appears that we need to revisit practices in pharmacological management.

### Depressed patients with co-occurring alcohol use disorders: A unique patient population [^112oLyeb]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Alcohol use and depressive disorders are frequently comorbid. Few studies have assessed the impact of comorbid alcohol use disorders (AUDs) on clinical aspects of major depression. This study compared depressed subjects with and without co-occurring AUDs in terms of demographic and clinical parameters.

- **Method**: 505 individuals participated. 318 subjects had DSM-IV major depressive disorder (MDD) without a history of any alcohol or substance abuse/dependence (MDD only), and 187 individuals had both MDD and a history of alcohol abuse/dependence (MDD/AUD). Demographic, clinical, and psychiatric history measures of patients in the two groups were examined and compared. The study was conducted from January 1990 to June 2005.

- **Results**: MDD/AUD patients were younger at their first psychiatric hospitalization (p = .014), their first major depressive episode (p = .041), and their first suicide attempt (p = .001). They reported more previous major depressive episodes (p = .001), suicide attempts (p = .001), and recent life events (p = .001); and had higher lifetime aggression (p < .001), impulsivity (p < .001), and hostility (p < .001) scores compared to MDD only patients. MDD/AUD patients were also more likely to report tobacco smoking (p < .001), a lifetime history of abuse (p = .004), and a history of AUD among first-degree relatives (p < .001) compared to MDD only patients. MDD/AUD individuals also had higher childhood (p < .001), adolescent (p < .001), and adult (p < .001) aggression scores and reported more behavioral problems during their childhood compared to their counterparts.

### Randomized controlled trial of cognitive-behavioural therapy for coexisting depression and alcohol problems: short-term outcome [^115kVTmh]. Addiction (2010). Low credibility.

Alcohol use disorders and depression frequently co-occur and are associated with poorer outcomes than when either condition occurs alone. The present study, Depression and Alcohol Integrated and Single-focused Interventions (DAISI), aimed to compare the effectiveness of brief intervention, single-focused, and integrated psychological interventions for the treatment of coexisting depression and alcohol use problems.

Participants (n = 284) with depressive symptoms and hazardous alcohol use were assessed and randomly allocated to one of four individually delivered interventions: (i) a brief intervention only (single 90-minute session) with an integrated focus on depression and alcohol, or followed by a further nine 1-hour sessions with an (ii) alcohol focus; (iii) depression focus; or (iv) integrated focus. Follow-up assessments occurred 18 weeks after baseline.

Compared with the brief intervention, 10 sessions were associated with greater reductions in average drinks per week, average drinking days per week, and maximum consumption during one day. No difference in the duration of treatment was found for depression outcomes. Compared with single-focused interventions, integrated treatment was associated with a greater reduction in drinking days and level of depression. For men, the alcohol-focused rather than depression-focused intervention was associated with a greater reduction in average drinks per day and drinks per week, and an increased level of general functioning. Women showed greater improvements in each of these variables when they received depression-focused interventions.

### Adverse impact of marijuana use on clinical outcomes among psychiatry patients with depression and alcohol use disorder [^113uB6sU]. Psychiatry Research (2018). Low credibility.

This study examined whether marijuana use was associated with clinically problematic outcomes for patients with depression and alcohol use disorder (AUD). The sample consisted of 307 psychiatry outpatients with mild to severe depression and past 30-day hazardous drinking/drug use, who participated in a trial of substance use treatment. Participants were assessed for AUD based on DSM-IV criteria. Measures of marijuana use, depression symptoms, and functional status related to mental health were collected at baseline, 3, and 6 months. Differences in these outcomes were analyzed among patients with and without AUD using growth models, adjusting for treatment effects. Marijuana was examined as both an outcome (patterns of use) and a predictor (impact on depression and functioning).

Forty percent used marijuana, and about half the sample met AUD criteria. Fewer patients with AUD used marijuana than those without AUD at baseline. Over 6 months, the proportion of patients with AUD using marijuana increased compared to those without AUD. Patients with AUD using marijuana had greater depressive symptoms and worse functioning than those without AUD. These findings indicate that marijuana use is clinically problematic for psychiatry outpatients with depression and AUD. Addressing marijuana in the context of psychiatry treatment may help improve outcomes.

### Pharmacologic management of adult depression [^111k87B8]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Major depression is a common and treatable disease. Many patients benefit from pharmacologic treatment, and because there is little variation in antidepressant effectiveness, medication choices should be made based on patient characteristics, safety, and anticipated side effects. Most patients respond favorably to treatment, but many do not experience complete symptom relief. Changing medications or augmenting with a second medication can be helpful for some partial or non-responders.

All antidepressants are capable of producing harmful side effects, and some are particularly prone to dangerous drug-drug interactions. The risk of suicide is always a concern in depression, and this risk is not necessarily reduced by the use of antidepressants. Some individuals may experience an increase in suicidal thoughts with antidepressant treatment. Close follow-up is required when initiating therapy and adjusting dosages.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^117Tfpnm]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, specifically the management of withdrawal seizures, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend the preferred parenteral administration of medications following a withdrawal seizure. Intravenous (IV) administration is preferred over intramuscular (IM) administration if available, although IM administration is also effective. Parenteral phenobarbital should only be used in highly supervised settings, such as the intensive care unit (ICU) or a critical care unit, due to the risk of oversedation and respiratory depression.

### Treatment-resistant depression as risk factor for substance use disorders-a nation-wide register-based cohort study [^113PUrZF]. Addiction (2019). Low credibility.

Somewhat unexpectedly, alcohol use disorder, the largest SUD category by the number of patients, was not associated with TRD in this study. A positive association between MDD and future alcohol use has been demonstrated in a meta-analysis, while in a study on similar register data from Denmark, 26% of patients with alcohol use disorder had a previous MDD before developing a SUD. However, a 10-year follow-up of the National Comorbidity Survey (NCS) could not establish a temporal association between MDD at baseline and alcohol abuse. Alcohol use disorder may not be related to treatment effect in MDD, which is the exposure in this study.

The two- to threefold risk increase for sedative use disorder seen in this study — even though anxiety disorders were adjusted for — may partly be explained by more prescriptions of benzodiazepines among TRD patients, which may later progress into a SUD. This could be supported by the fact that nervous traits in depression are a risk factor for TRD. Conversely, benzodiazepine use has been suggested to increase risk for TRD.

There are various theories regarding the comorbidity of SUD following MDD, including substance use as self-medication for depressive symptoms or shared predisposing factors. There is, however, a paucity of studies investigating a temporal association of the efficacy of MDD treatment with the occurrence of SUD. The majority of both clinical and large-scale epidemiological data investigating the association between MDD severity and SUD are cross-sectional. In claims data, both mood disorder diagnoses and anti-depressant prescriptions are frequently recorded simultaneously, making the temporal pattern difficult to ascertain.

### Medications for alcohol use disorder [^113DpUxm]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends that clinicians screen adults for alcohol misuse and provide persons engaged in risky or hazardous drinking behaviors with brief behavioral counseling to reduce alcohol misuse. However, only a minority of American adults with high-risk alcohol use receive treatment. Three medications are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat alcohol use disorder: acamprosate, disulfiram, and naltrexone. Acamprosate and naltrexone reduce alcohol consumption and increase abstinence rates, although the effects appear to be modest. Disulfiram has been used for years, but evidence supporting its effectiveness is inconsistent. Other medications may be beneficial to reduce heavy alcohol use. The anticonvulsants topiramate and gabapentin may reduce alcohol ingestion, although long-term studies are lacking. Antidepressants do not decrease alcohol use in patients without mood disorders, but sertraline and fluoxetine may help depressed patients decrease alcohol ingestion. Ondansetron may reduce alcohol use, particularly in selected subpopulations. Further study is needed for genetically targeted or as-needed medications to reduce alcohol use.

### Use of non-psychiatric medications with potential depressive symptom side effects and level of depressive symptoms in major depressive disorder [^113vnLMZ]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

The objective of this study was to determine whether the use of medications with potential depressive symptom side effects is associated with a higher level of depressive symptoms in adults with antidepressant-treated major depressive disorder (MDD).

The methods involved analyzing data from the 2013–2014, 2015–2016, and 2017–2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), which is a nationally representative cross-sectional survey of the US general population. Among 885 adult participants who reported receiving antidepressants for the treatment of International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification MDD, researchers assessed the association between the number of medications with potential depressive symptom side effects and the level of depressive symptoms.

The results showed that a majority (66.7%, n = 618) of participants with antidepressant-treated MDD used at least one non-psychiatric medication with potential depressive symptom side effects, and 37.3% (n = 370) used more than one such medication. The number of medications with depressive symptom side effects was significantly associated with lower odds of no to minimal depressive symptoms, defined as a Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) score < 5 (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.75, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.64–0.87, P < 0.001), and higher odds of moderate to severe symptoms, defined as a PHQ-9 score ≥ 10 (AOR = 1.14, 95% CI = 1.004–1.29, P = 0.044). No such associations were found for medications without potential depressive symptom side effects.

Individuals treated for MDD frequently use non-psychiatric medications.

Regarding specific circumstances for major depressive disorder, especially in pediatric and adolescent patients, the World Health Organization's 2023 guidelines recommend referring adolescent patients (13–17 years) with moderate-to-severe depression, who do not respond to psychosocial interventions alone, to a specialist. This is for a more comprehensive assessment and to explore the initiation of fluoxetine in combination with psychological treatments.

### Treatment of patients comorbid for addiction and other psychiatric disorders [^1144TLyy]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2007). Low credibility.

Psychiatric disorders and drug and alcohol use disorders commonly co-occur. A growing literature has documented the epidemiology and effects on the course of illness of comorbid psychiatric and substance use disorders (SUDs). However, advances in the treatment of co-occurring illnesses have progressed more slowly. This article reviews recent developments in the diagnosis and treatment of co-occurring psychiatric disorders and SUDs, with a particular focus on psychotic disorders, affective disorders, anxiety disorders, personality disorders, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Treatment options and implications for future research are highlighted.

### Treatment of comorbid alcohol use disorders and depression with cognitive-behavioral therapy and motivational interviewing: a meta-analysis [^115VpPb6]. Addiction (2014). Low credibility.

We calculated mean effect sizes (Hedges's g) for each comparison using the computer program Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA, version 2.2.021). Cohen's d is the standardized difference between the two means divided by the pooled standard deviation at post-test. Hedges's g is a variation of Cohen's d that corrects for potential bias due to small sample sizes. Effect sizes of approximately 0.8 can be considered large, 0.5 moderate, and 0.2 small. Because several studies had small samples, we corrected the effect sizes for bias using the procedures suggested by Hedges & Olkin.

We calculated separate effect sizes for depression and for alcohol consumption, which were the primary outcome measures in the analyzed studies. If means and standard deviations were not reported, we contacted the study authors to obtain these and/or used other statistics to calculate the effect sizes according to the procedures implemented in our meta-analysis software. Where possible, data from intention-to-treat analyses were used, while completers-only data were used if the former were unavailable. If more than one depression or alcohol outcome measure was reported in a single study, we averaged the effect sizes from those measures to produce a single summary effect size for use in the meta-analysis, adjusting those calculations statistically to account for variance introduced by the multiple measures. Figures 2 and 3 show the studies for which this was the case; the outcome was then indicated with 'combined'.

### Substance use disorders and risk for treatment resistant depression: A population-based, nested case-control study [^115Jm673]. Addiction (2020). Low credibility.

Substance use disorders (SUD) are conditions in which the use of one or more psychoactive substances leads to clinically significant distress or functional impairment. SUDs are major contributors to disability worldwide and constitute risk factors for a vast array of adverse mental and physical outcomes, including depressive disorders.

Among patients with depression, the lifetime prevalence of SUD is up to 40%, with alcohol use disorder being the most common. The self-reported 12-month prevalence of SUD is 19%. Although the association between SUD and depression is robust in the literature, causality is unclear. The temporal association appears bidirectional and may show lifetime variation. Alcohol, opioid, and in some studies, cannabis use have been identified as risk factors for depression. The role of benzodiazepine and stimulant use is less clear and may also be influenced by post-SUD anhedonia.

Depression is a leading cause of disability worldwide, with potentially disastrous outcomes such as suicide. In clinical studies of sequential antidepressant treatment of depression, designed to emulate real-life treatment conditions, up to 30% of patients do not respond, and up to 50% do not respond adequately after two antidepressant treatment trials. As a consequence, the study of patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) has garnered increasing interest in recent decades. Several methods of defining and staging TRD have been proposed, with failure to achieve an adequate treatment response after two separate trials being a common standard.

### Pharmacological approaches to manage persistent symptoms of major depressive disorder: Rationale and therapeutic strategies [^11348yug]. Psychiatry Research (2014). Low credibility.

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a highly prevalent chronic psychiatric illness associated with significant morbidity, mortality, loss of productivity, and diminished quality of life. Typically, only a minority of patients respond to treatment and meet the criteria for remission, as residual symptoms may persist due to an inadequate course of treatment and/or the presence of persistent side effects. The foremost goal of treatment should be to restore patients to full functioning and eliminate or relieve all MDD symptoms while being virtually free of troublesome side effects.

Available pharmacological options to manage persistent depressive symptoms include augmentation or adjunctive combination strategies, both of which target selected psychobiological systems and specific mood and somatic symptoms experienced by the patient. Non-pharmacological interventions, including psychotherapies, may also be used in either first-line or adjunctive approaches. However, the evidence at the time of writing, in respect to available adjunct therapies, is limited by the few studies published, which have utilized only a small number of subjects, thus lacking enough data to allow for a consensus of expert opinion. This underlines the need for further long-term, large population-based studies, including those with comorbid populations, which are all seen in real-world community psychiatry.

### Analysis of patient-reported outcomes of quality of life and functioning before and after treatment of major depressive disorder comorbid with alcohol use disorders [^116N59sm]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) are common among individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) and have an adverse impact on the course of illness and patient outcomes. The aim of this study was to examine whether AUD adversely impacted patient-centered outcomes in a sample of research subjects evaluated as part of a large clinical trial for depression. The outcomes of interest in this post hoc analysis are quality of life (QOL), functioning, and depressive symptom severity.

We analyzed data from 2280 adult MDD outpatient research subjects using the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression trial. We compared entry and post-selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) treatment QOL, functioning, and depressive symptom severity scores between 121 comorbid MDD with AUD (MDD+AUD) subjects and 2159 MDD-no-AUD subjects. Differences were also evaluated between subjects categorized as remitters versus non-remitters within each group at exit.

At entry, MDD+AUD subjects reported similar QOL, functioning, and depressive symptom severity compared to the MDD-no-AUD subjects. After treatment with citalopram, both groups showed significant improvements throughout treatment; however, 36% to 55% of subjects still suffered from severely impaired QOL and functioning at exit.

The overall study population demonstrated a significant response to treatment with large effect sizes in depressive symptom reduction, but to a lesser extent in QOL and functioning. Findings suggest that subjects with MDD+AUD benefited equally as MDD-no-AUD from treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.

### Treatment of comorbid alcohol use disorders and depression with cognitive-behavioural therapy and motivational interviewing: a meta-analysis [^111tdnsR]. Addiction (2014). Low credibility.

We assessed overall outcomes in terms of depressive symptoms and alcohol consumption. The effect sizes for alcohol use were based on varying measures, and there were not enough studies to look separately at distinctions such as abstinence or percentage of heavy drinking days. Such diversity of measures is a common problem in alcohol studies, as noted by Sobell and colleagues; and, as Hobbs and colleagues have pointed out, that may have resulted in less variability in outcome than would have been found in studies with fewer or single measures. To minimize this potential bias, we followed guidelines in meta-analytical strategy manuals.

We included both randomized and non-randomized controlled studies in our analyses but found no difference between those two designs in terms of effect sizes for alcohol or depression. Such a difference might have been expected, as randomization often yields lower clinical outcomes. Generalization of our study results requires caution, as all but one of the included studies involved out-patients only.

Combined CBT/MI treatment of comorbid clinical and subclinical major depressive disorder (MDD) and alcohol use disorder (AUD), both for clinical and community samples, shows promising results. The observed effects were small, but they could still imply a major health impact in view of the high prevalence of comorbidity of these disorders, the related high burden of disease, and the preference by many patients for CBT/MI over antidepressants.

### Psilocybin in alcohol use disorder and comorbid depressive symptoms: Results from a feasibility randomized clinical trial [^112EaBYa]. Addiction (2025). High credibility.

Psilocybin has emerged as a potential treatment for alcohol use disorder (AUD), but early efficacy data are inconsistent. Depression following alcohol detoxification significantly increases the risk of relapse. This pilot study aimed to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy for patients with comorbid AUD and depression.

- **Design**: A prospective, single-center, double-blind, parallel (2:1), randomized controlled pilot study.

- **Setting**: The study was conducted in a French inpatient addiction treatment program offering intensive relapse prevention interventions.

- **Participants**: Of 350 screened patients, 30 adults (mean age 49 ± 10 years; 43% female) with severe AUD (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition [DSM-5] criteria) and a Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) score ≥ 14 were included. Participants had completed detoxification between 14 and 60 days prior to inclusion.

- **Interventions**: Participants received either two oral sessions of 25mg (n = 20) or 1mg (n = 10) psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy spaced three weeks apart, as an add-on to standard care. Patients, investigators, and outcome assessors were all blinded to patient group.

- **Measurements**: The primary outcome was feasibility, according to participation in both dosing sessions and recruitment/inclusion rates. Secondary outcomes included alcohol use (Alcohol Timeline Followback), time to relapse, craving (Craving Experience Questionnaire), depression (BDI-II), safety, and blinding integrity.

- **Findings**: One participant dropped out before completion, demonstrating a strong feasibility signal. The study showed preliminarily promising efficacy results for reducing alcohol use and depression symptoms. Safety profiles were consistent with existing psilocybin research, and blinding was maintained across groups.

### Pharmacotherapy for anxiety and comorbid alcohol use disorders [^114U8rKm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). High credibility.

Anxiety disorders are a potentially disabling group of disorders that frequently co-occur with alcohol use disorders. Comorbid anxiety and alcohol use disorders are associated with poorer outcomes and are difficult to treat with standard psychosocial interventions. An improved understanding of the biological basis of these conditions has contributed to a growing interest in using medications for treating individuals with both diagnoses.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of pharmacotherapy for treating anxiety in people with comorbid alcohol use disorders, specifically: to provide an estimate of the overall effects of medication on improving treatment response and reducing symptom severity in the treatment of anxiety disorders in people with comorbid alcohol use disorders; to determine whether specific medications are more effective and tolerable than others in the treatment of particular anxiety disorders; and to identify which factors (clinical, methodological) predict response to pharmacotherapy for anxiety disorders.

- **Search methods**: Review authors searched the specialized registers of The Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group (CCDANCTR, up to January 2014) and the Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group (CDAG, up to March 2013) for eligible trials. These registers contain reports of relevant randomized controlled trials (RCT) from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, all years), MEDLINE (from 1950), EMBASE (from 1974), and PsycINFO (from 1967). Review authors ran complementary searches.

### Psychiatric comorbidities in alcohol use disorder [^11761SxR]. The Lancet Psychiatry (2019). Low credibility.

Alcohol use disorder is a major contributor to the morbidity and mortality burden worldwide. It often coexists with other psychiatric disorders; however, the nature of this comorbidity is still a matter of debate. In this series paper, we examine the main psychiatric disorders associated with alcohol use disorder, including the prevalence of co-occurring disorders, the temporal nature of the relationship, and mechanisms that might explain comorbidity across the lifespan.

Overall, this disorder co-occurs with a wide range of other psychiatric disorders, especially those disorders involving substance use and violent or aggressive behavior. The causal pathways between alcohol use disorder and other psychiatric disorders are heterogeneous. Hypotheses explaining these relationships include reciprocal direct causal associations, shared genetic and environmental causes, and shared psychopathological characteristics of broader diagnostic entities (e.g. externalizing disorders). Efforts to untangle the associations between alcohol use disorder and other disorders across the lifespan remain a crucial avenue of research.

### Comparison of prefrontal cell pathology between depression and alcohol dependence [^111NXbSA]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2003). Low credibility.

Chronic alcohol abuse is often co-morbid with depression symptoms and, in many cases, it appears to induce major depressive disorder. Structural and functional neuroimaging has provided evidence supporting some degree of neuropathological convergence of alcoholism and mood disorders. In order to understand the cellular neuropathology of alcohol dependence and mood disorders, postmortem morphometric studies have tested the possibility of alterations in the number and size of cells in the prefrontal cortex and other brain regions.

The present review compares the cell pathology in the prefrontal cortex between alcohol dependence and depression, and reveals both similarities and differences. One of the most striking similarities is that, although pathology affects both neuronal and glial cells, effects on glia are more dramatic than on neurons in both alcohol dependence comorbid with depression and idiopathic depression. Moreover, prefrontal cortical regions are commonly affected in both depression and alcoholism.

However, the cellular changes are more prominent and spread across cortical layers in alcohol-dependent subjects than in subjects with mood disorders, and changes in glial nucleus size are opposite in alcoholism and depression. It could be argued that one defining factor in the manifestation of depressive pathology is a reduction in the glial distribution in the dlPFC that is reflected in a reduced glial density. In alcoholism, reduced glial nuclear size might be related to the cytotoxic effects of prolonged alcohol exposure, while in major depressive disorder, in the absence of alcohol, a different mechanism might be at play.

### The prevalence and impact of alcohol problems in major depression: A systematic review [^116FSj3f]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Major depression and alcohol problems are common in primary care, yet little is known about the prevalence of alcohol problems in patients with depression or alcohol's effect on depression outcomes. We aimed to answer the following questions: How common are alcohol problems in patients with depression? Does alcohol affect the course of depression, response to antidepressant therapy, risk of suicide/death, social functioning, and health care utilization? In which alcohol categories and treatment settings have patients with depression and alcohol problems been evaluated?

English language studies from MEDLINE, PsychINFO, and the Cochrane Controlled Trial Registry were reviewed. Studies were selected using predefined criteria if they reported on the prevalence or effects of alcohol problems in depression. Thirty-five studies met the criteria and revealed a median prevalence of alcohol problems in depression of 16% (range 5–67%) and lifetime alcohol problems of 30% (range 10–60%), respectively. This compares with 7% for alcohol problems and 16–24% for lifetime alcohol problems in the general population.

There is evidence that antidepressants improve depression outcomes in persons with alcohol dependence. Alcohol problems are associated with worse outcomes concerning depression course, suicide/death risk, social functioning, and health care utilization. The majority of the studies, 34 of 35 (97%), evaluated alcohol abuse and dependence, and 25 of 35 (71%) were conducted in psychiatric inpatients. We conclude that alcohol problems are more common in depression than in the general population.

### Comorbidity between major depression and alcohol use disorder from adolescence to adulthood [^114PwDdp]. Comprehensive Psychiatry (2014). Low credibility.

Limited information exists regarding the long-term development of comorbidity between major depressive disorder (MDD) and alcohol use disorder (AUD; abuse/dependence). Using a representative prospective study, we examine multiple aspects pertaining to MDD+AUD comorbidity, with a focus on the relation between disorders across periods (adolescence, early adulthood, adulthood) and cumulative impairments by age 30.

A total of 816 participants were diagnostically interviewed at ages 16, 17, 24, and 30. The rates of comorbid MDD+AUD were low in adolescence (2%) but increased in early adulthood (11%) and adulthood (7%). Rates of cumulative comorbidity were elevated (21%). Most individuals with a history of MDD or AUD had the other disorder, except for women with MDD. Prospectively, adolescent AUD predicted early adult MDD, while early adult MDD predicted adult AUD. Compared to pure disorders, MDD+AUD was associated with higher risk of alcohol dependence, suicide attempts, lower global functioning, and life dissatisfaction.

Lifetime rates of comorbid MDD+AUD were considerably higher than in cross-sectional studies. Comorbidity was partly explained by bidirectional and developmentally specific associations and predicted selected rather than generalized impairments. Clinically, our findings emphasize the need to always carefully assess comorbidity in patients with MDD or AUD, taking into account concurrency and developmental timing.

### Novel and emerging treatments for major depression [^117VwM4k]. Lancet (2023). High credibility.

Depression is common, costly, debilitating, and associated with an increased risk of suicide. It is one of the leading global public health problems. Although existing pharmacological treatments can be effective, their onset of action can take up to six weeks, side effects are common, and recovery can require treatment with multiple different agents. While psychosocial interventions might also be recommended, more effective treatments than those currently available are needed for people with moderate or severe depression. In the past ten years, treatment trials have developed and tested many new targeted interventions. In this review, we assess novel and emerging biological treatments for major depressive disorder, evaluate their putative brain and body mechanisms, and highlight how close each might be to clinical use.

### Treatment of depression in patients with alcohol or other drug dependence: a meta-analysis [^115xbj8h]. JAMA (2004). Low credibility.

Depression and substance abuse are common and costly disorders that frequently co-occur, but controversy about effective treatment for patients with both disorders persists.

- **Objective**: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to quantify the efficacy of antidepressant medications for treatment of combined depression and substance use disorders.

- **Data sources**: PubMed, MEDLINE, and Cochrane database searches were conducted from 1970 to 2003, using the keywords "antidepressant treatment" or "treatment depressed" in conjunction with terms such as "alcohol dependence", "benzodiazepine dependence", "opiate dependence", "cocaine dependence", "marijuana dependence", and "methadone". Additional sources included a search of bibliographies and consultation with experts in the field.

- **Study selection**: The inclusion criteria for study selection were prospective, parallel group, double-blind, controlled clinical trials with random assignment to an antidepressant medication or placebo. Trial patients needed to meet standard diagnostic criteria for alcohol or other drug use and a unipolar depressive disorder. Out of more than 300 citations extracted, 44 were placebo-controlled clinical trials, and 14, involving 848 patients, were selected for analysis. These included 5 studies of tricyclic antidepressants, 7 of selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, and 2 from other classes.

- **Data extraction**: We independently screened the titles and abstracts of each citation, identified placebo-controlled trials of patients with both substance dependence and depression, applied the inclusion criteria, and reached consensus.

### APA clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^116jBjup]. APA (2019). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for major depressive disorder, particularly in pediatric and adolescent patients, pharmacotherapy should be approached with caution. According to the APA 2019 guidelines, there is insufficient evidence to recommend medications other than fluoxetine for adolescent patients. It is crucial to engage in shared decision-making regarding medication options. This process should involve a child psychiatrist alongside the clinician, patient, and their parents or guardians, as well as other family members actively involved in the patient's care. If fluoxetine is not a viable or acceptable treatment option, this collaborative approach becomes even more essential.

### Acupuncture for alcohol use disorder: Research status and potential strategies to improve therapeutic efficacy [^111bNvVR]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2025). Low credibility.

Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a prevalent, chronic relapsing substance use disorder, with its prevalence increasing worldwide along with socioeconomic development. Given the limitations of conventional AUD treatments, such as the variable efficacy of pharmacotherapy and implementation challenges of some psychotherapy methods, researchers have increasingly investigated acupuncture as a potential adjunctive therapy. Acupuncture is a traditional complementary therapy that has shown potential in managing mental and behavioral disorders. Its cost-effectiveness and accessibility vary across healthcare systems; however, preliminary evidence suggests adjunctive benefits for AUD.

Through modulation of the dopaminergic and opioid systems and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, acupuncture may reduce alcohol consumption and cravings, thereby facilitating AUD management. It may also help alleviate associated mental health issues such as anxiety, depression, and insomnia. This review investigated and stratified commonly used acupoints in preclinical and clinical studies, offering recommendations for enhanced application and investigation of acupuncture treatment for AUD. The paucity of research in this domain warrants further exploration through well-structured research initiatives.

### Treatment of the depressed alcoholic patient [^112hxb29]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2012). Low credibility.

Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) and depressive illnesses are highly prevalent, frequently co-occur, and are associated with worse outcomes when paired. The assessment and treatment of patients with co-occurring alcohol use disorders and depressive illnesses present many significant challenges. The data for advocating treatment guidelines for this dually diagnosed population are limited. However, they do suggest that an integrated approach to patients presenting with co-occurring AUDs and depressive symptoms can be efficacious. In this approach, ongoing evaluation and treatment are provided under one roof according to the evolving needs of each patient. Utilizing antidepressant medications in conjunction with psychosocial therapies may augment overall treatment efficacy. Data also suggest that tailoring and combining psychosocial therapies, such as motivational enhancement therapies, cognitive therapies, and twelve-step facilitation, may further improve treatment outcomes for patients with co-occurring depressive and alcohol use disorders.

### A network meta-analysis of the effects of psychotherapies, pharmacotherapies and their combination in the treatment of adult depression [^113Ah4R8]. World Psychiatry (2020). High credibility.

No network meta-analysis has examined the relative effects of psychotherapies, pharmacotherapies, and their combination in the treatment of adult depression; this is a very important clinical issue. We conducted systematic searches in bibliographical databases to identify randomized trials in which a psychotherapy and a pharmacotherapy for the acute or long-term treatment of depression were compared with each other, or in which the combination of a psychotherapy and a pharmacotherapy was compared with either one alone. The main outcome was treatment response, defined as a 50% improvement between baseline and endpoint. Remission and acceptability, defined as study drop-out for any reason, were also examined.

Possible moderators that were assessed included chronic and treatment-resistant depression and baseline severity of depression. Data were pooled as relative risk (RR) using a random-effects model. A total of 101 studies with 11,910 patients were included. Depression in most studies was moderate to severe.

In the network meta-analysis:

- **Combined treatment vs. psychotherapy alone**: Combined treatment was more effective (RR = 1.27; 95% CI: 1.14–1.39).
- **Combined treatment vs. pharmacotherapy alone**: Combined treatment showed higher effectiveness (RR = 1.25; 95% CI: 1.14–1.37) in achieving response at the end of treatment.
- **Psychotherapy alone vs. pharmacotherapy alone**: No significant difference was found (RR = 0.99; 95% CI: 0.92–1.08).

Similar results were found for remission. Combined treatment (RR = 1.23; 95% CI: 1.05–1.45) and psychotherapy alone (RR = 1.17; 95% CI: 1.02–1.32) were more acceptable than pharmacotherapy. Results were similar for chronic and treatment-resistant depression cases.

### Associations of common mental disorder with alcohol use in the adult general population: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114fZ8qt]. Addiction (2022). Low credibility.

There is evidence for an association between worsening mental health and increased alcohol use. Motivational models argue that individuals may be motivated to use alcohol to cope with stress, where benefits outweigh the cost. Such models suggest that alcohol may be used to cope with symptoms of poor mental health, and used specifically due to its rapid onset of action. This might be the case among those with a CMD, as drinking alcohol may be perceived to alleviate symptoms of a disorder.

Genome-wide studies have shown a causal relationship between CMDs, such as major depression and alcohol dependence, while the reverse association has not been found. However, associations between alcohol use and mental health comorbidity may be more complex and vary based upon the specific type of CMD. Among the general population, research has shown that those with major depressive disorder (MDD) were more likely to report lifetime moderate/severe AUD compared to those without MDD, whereas those with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) were more likely to report mild or severe AUD compared to those without GAD. Elsewhere, a significant association with alcohol dependence among those meeting criteria for alcohol abuse was reported among those with dysthymia but not MDD compared to those without the respective disorder, while a review across observational studies showed differences in associations with AUD with specific types of anxiety disorders, such as panic disorder. Differences in associations have also been found for other patterns of alcohol use. For example, in Portugal, a positive association was observed…

### Quality of outpatient depression treatment in patients with comorbid substance use disorder [^116XYZy6]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2021). Low credibility.

The clinical practice guidelines recommend the concurrent treatment of co-occurring depression and substance use disorders. However, the extent to which patients with substance use disorders receive guideline-concordant treatment for depression remains unclear. This study investigates the provision of guideline-concordant depression treatment to patients with and without substance use disorders in a large integrated health care system.

In a retrospective cohort study involving 53,034 patients diagnosed with a depressive disorder in fiscal year 2017 in the U.S. Veterans Health Administration, the association of comorbid substance use disorders with guideline-concordant depression treatment, including both medication and psychotherapy, was assessed while adjusting for patient demographic and clinical characteristics.

The results indicate that guideline-concordant depression treatment metrics were lower for patients with co-occurring depression and substance use disorders compared to those without substance use disorders. In covariate-adjusted models of antidepressant treatment, patients with substance use disorders had 21% lower odds of receiving guideline-concordant acute treatment (adjusted odds ratio = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.73, 0.84) and 26% lower odds of continuation of treatment (adjusted odds ratio = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.69, 0.79). Regarding psychotherapy, patients with co-occurring depression and substance use disorders had 13% lower odds (adjusted odds ratio = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.82, 0.91) of receiving adequate acute-phase treatment.

### Effect of concurrent substance use disorder on the effectiveness of single and combination antidepressant medications for the treatment of major depression: an exploratory analysis of a single-blind randomized trial [^114a94VJ]. Depression and Anxiety (2012). Low credibility.

The co-occurrence of substance use disorder (SUD) and major depressive disorder (MDD) is common and is often thought to impair response to antidepressant therapy. These patients are often excluded from clinical trials, resulting in a significant knowledge gap regarding optimal pharmacotherapy for the treatment of MDD with concurrent SUD.

- **Methods**: In the Combining Medications to Enhance Depression Outcomes study, 665 adult outpatients with chronic and/or recurrent MDD were prospectively treated with either escitalopram monotherapy (escitalopram and placebo) or an antidepressant combination (venlafaxine-XR and mirtazapine or escitalopram and bupropion-SR). Participants with MDD and concurrent SUD (13.1%) were compared to those without SUD (86.9%) on sociodemographic and clinical characteristics at baseline and treatment response at 12- and 28-week endpoints.

- **Results**: The participants with MDD and SUD were more likely to be male, have suicidal thoughts/plans, and had a greater lifetime severity and number of suicide attempts. They also had a higher number of concurrent Axis I disorders, particularly concurrent anxiety disorders. There were no significant differences between the MDD with or without SUD groups in terms of dose, time in treatment, response, or remission at week 12 and 28. Furthermore, no significant differences in response or remission rates were noted between groups based on the presence or absence of SUD and treatment assignment.

- **Conclusions**: Although significant baseline sociodemographic and clinical differences exist, patients with MDD and SUD did not show significant differences in treatment outcomes compared to those without SUD.

### Late-life depression and alcoholism [^111grDhi]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2007). Low credibility.

The relationship between alcohol use and later-life depression is complex. At-risk and problem drinking elevate the risk of depressive symptoms. The co-occurrence of alcohol use disorders and depression increases the potential for poor mental and physical health outcomes in older adults. Many older adults experiencing problems related to alcohol use do not meet the criteria for alcohol abuse or dependence. Depressive symptoms among older adults are often overlooked or misdiagnosed. The role of at-risk and problem alcohol use in depressive symptoms and vice versa may be underestimated. After reviewing the literature, clinical recommendations for addressing late-life alcohol misuse and depression are presented.

### The interaction of drug- and psychotherapy in the long-term treatment of depression [^114E6ezR]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2001). Low credibility.

Recent advances in our understanding of both short- and long-term therapeutic interventions for depressive disorders have necessitated greater precision in defining appropriate therapeutic interventions. While these remarkable changes in treatment have been based on the introduction of newer antidepressant agents, the advances have occurred because of more systematic clinical trials and a greater sophistication in defining diagnostic and treatment response criteria. This paper reviews key findings regarding long-term treatment of depression, with particular attention paid to the combination treatment of psychotherapy and antidepressant drugs.

### Beyond evidence-based treatment of bipolar disorder: Rational pragmatic approaches to management [^114YwvpG]. Bipolar Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

Multiple drugs are now FDA-approved treatments for alcohol abuse, although all have been studied and approved for those with primary abuse disorders and not bipolar disorder. Most of these drugs, perhaps with the exception of disulfiram, which is a dopamine beta-hydroxylase inhibitor, would likely be safe in patients with bipolar disorder. Baclofen, which has beneficial effects in alcohol abuse, should also be avoided as it can exacerbate depression.

In patients experiencing difficulties with a variety of anxiety and/or substance abuse syndromes, N-acetylcysteine (NAC) may offer actions against both. NAC helps reduce depression, OCD, and PTSD and the use of substances, including nicotine, alcohol, cocaine, as well as marijuana in youngsters. Inconsistent data in bipolar disorder notwithstanding, the authors endorse the use of NAC, typically 500 mg bid for 1 week increasing to 1000 mg bid thereafter in most individuals with difficult-to-treat depression and anxiety, especially if there is complicating substance use.

Folic acid has a long record of effectiveness in supplementing the efficacy of antidepressants in unipolar disorder and one small study by Alec Coppen in augmenting lithium, so it might be useful to add. However, this is countered by the data that in patients where lamotrigine was added to quetiapine, the addition of folate was detrimental to the lamotrigine effect. If the patient has a MTHFR deficiency, L-methylfolate becomes necessary rather than folate. There are trials of omega 3 supplementation that are positive, augmented pragmatically by the safety and tolerance.

### Treatment-resistant depression as risk factor for substance use disorders-a nation-wide register-based cohort study [^111viFZ5]. Addiction (2019). Low credibility.

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a highly prevalent and often chronic condition with substantial consequences for both the individual and society in terms of functional loss, costs, and premature death. Not all depressed individuals respond as intended to treatment; 10–20% do not tolerate an initial treatment trial, and 25–60% of those who complete an adequate trial do not achieve remission. During the last decades, several definitions of treatment‐resistant depression (TRD) have been proposed for clinical and research purposes, all sharing the common denominator of requiring at least two adequate treatment attempts without achieving remission.

Substance use disorders (SUD) as defined by DSM‐5 are conditions where the use of one or more psychoactive substances leads to clinically significant impairment or distress, replacing the earlier diagnostic concepts of abuse, addiction, and dependence. SUDs may lead to various adverse mental, physical, and economic outcomes and account for 5% of the global burden of lost disability‐adjusted life‐years. In administrative data, the 12-month prevalence of alcohol or drug dependence in MDD patients is estimated at approximately 12%, increasing to up to 30% in clinical samples.

A wide range of studies show a temporal association from depression to SUD, but the relationship appears to be complex. Depression and other mental disorders often precede the presentation of SUDs, regardless of the substance being used. There is also evidence that the relationship may be temporally reversed.

### Alcohol and depression [^114BENu7]. Addiction (2011). Low credibility.

To examine the literature on the associations between alcohol use disorders (AUD) and major depression (MD), and to evaluate the evidence for the existence of a causal relationship between the disorders.

- **Methods**: PsycInfo, PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and ISI Web of Science database searches were conducted for studies pertaining to AUD and MD from 1980 to the present. Random-effects models were used to derive estimates of the pooled adjusted odds ratios (AOR) for the links between AUD and MD among studies reporting an AOR.

- **Results**: The analysis revealed that the presence of either disorder doubled the risks of the second disorder, with pooled AORs ranging from 2.00 to 2.09. Epidemiological data suggest that the linkages between the disorders cannot be accounted for fully by common factors that influence both AUD and MD, and that the disorders appear to be linked in a causal manner. Further evidence suggests that the most plausible causal association between AUD and MD is one in which AUD increases the risk of MD, rather than vice versa. Potential mechanisms underlying these causal linkages include neurophysiological and metabolic changes resulting from exposure to alcohol. The need for further research examining mechanisms of linkage, gender differences in associations between AUD and MD, and classification issues was identified.

- **Conclusions**: The state of the literature suggests a causal linkage between alcohol use disorders and major depression, such that increasing involvement with alcohol increases the risk of depression. Further research is needed to clarify the nature of this relationship.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^115WoR5r]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, more specifically with respect to patients with opioid use disorder, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend obtaining close monitoring in patients on chronic opioid medication (opioid agonist therapy for opioid use disorder or pain) when prescribing benzodiazepines due to the increased risk of respiratory depression. Furthermore, it is advised to closely monitor patients taking sedative-hypnotic medications to determine the appropriate benzodiazepine dosage, as these patients may exhibit tolerance to benzodiazepines.

### Pharmacotherapies for co-occurring substance use and bipolar disorders: A systematic review [^115FUBr3]. Bipolar Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

Substance use disorders (SUDs), including those for alcohol, stimulants, tobacco, opioids, and cannabis, in patients with bipolar disorder are a major clinical and public health problem and are present in the majority of these patients. Nonetheless, the development of effective pharmacological treatments for co-occurring SUDs in bipolar illness has not been well-developed and may be an important practical reason for the reduced effectiveness of these medications in community practice.

We conducted a systematic review of the literature using PubMed, Medline, and Google Scholar, identifying 29 clinical studies that evaluated both mental health and SUD outcomes in patients with co-occurring bipolar disorders and SUDs.

Our findings suggest the potential of valproate sodium and lamotrigine as preferred pharmacological agents for the treatment of co-occurring psychiatric and substance use outcomes in these patients. However, many of the reviewed studies are of open-label designs and have modest sample sizes.

Thus, given the gaps in our knowledge, recommendations for treatment of this common and important co-morbidity are preliminary. Accordingly, the conduct of larger, randomized controlled trials for this co-morbidity is clearly needed.

### Treatment-resistant depression as risk factor for substance use disorders-a nation-wide register-based cohort study [^116DpihQ]. Addiction (2019). Low credibility.

As treatment-resistant depression (TRD) is a clinical concept, studies of long-term outcomes are rare, especially in large cohorts. In a recent systematic review of the literature on medium- to long-term outcomes in TRD, none of the studies reported data on substance use disorders (SUD). A possible means of studying long-term outcomes of TRD, including risk for SUD, in sufficiently large cohorts is using public health-care registers. Efforts to adapt clinical criteria of TRD to register data have recently been made in Taiwanese, Danish, and Swedish public health-care databases.

The aim of this study was to investigate in a national register-based setting whether patients with TRD are at higher risk for subsequent SUD than other patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), among patients with as well as without a previously known SUD.

### Venlafaxine hydrochloride [^116Aah5r]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose depression is persistently worse or who are experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms that might be precursors to worsening depression or suicidality, especially if these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms.

If the decision has been made to discontinue treatment, medication should be tapered as rapidly as is feasible, but with recognition that abrupt discontinuation can be associated with certain symptoms [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

Families and caregivers of patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder or other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric, should be alerted about the need to monitor patients for the emergence of agitation, irritability, unusual changes in behavior, and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of suicidality, and to report such symptoms immediately to health care providers. Such monitoring should include daily observation by families and caregivers.

Prescriptions for Venlafaxine Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets should be written for the smallest quantity of tablets consistent with good patient management in order to reduce the risk of overdose.

A major depressive episode may be the initial presentation of bipolar disorder. It is generally believed (though not established in controlled trials) that treating such an episode with an antidepressant alone can increase the likelihood of precipitation of a mixed/manic episode in patients at risk for bipolar disorder.

### Substance use disorders and risk for treatment resistant depression: A population-based, nested case-control study [^117FjPjN]. Addiction (2020). Low credibility.

The prescription data used in this study cover dispensed medications, but actual patient adherence is uncertain, which may be of relevance, especially regarding patients with SUD. Patients with SUD are generally more prone to non-adherence and loss to follow-up than other patients in psychiatric care, which may lead to underestimated ORs, as our definition of TRD requires the start of a third sequential treatment trial. Conversely, repeated contacts with healthcare may lead to a higher detection rate of SUD and possible misclassification bias among patients with TRD during the treatment period.

As the NPR only covers diagnoses from specialized care, any patients who received all treatment trials in primary care were not included. At least regarding SUD, this number should be low, as most SUD care in Sweden is provided in the specialized psychiatric care system. The exception is alcohol SUD, which was partly identified in this study through prescription data with full coverage also for primary care patients. A limitation of this operationalization of SUD — using both diagnostic and/or prescribed treatment data — is that it may not fully correspond to diagnostic definitions of SUD. Conversely, as both cases and controls had depression of sufficient severity to be treated in specialized care, the specificity of the depression diagnosis should be high. The absolute number of patients in three subcategories of SUD was too low for analysis, which could be related to the method of identifying these through registered diagnoses in specialized healthcare only.

### Medications for alcohol use disorder [^117LP6Ah]. American Family Physician (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for alcohol use disorder, particularly concerning naltrexone, the AAFP 2024 guidelines recommend recognizing that both oral naltrexone (50 mg) and IM naltrexone (380 mg) appear to be safe for patients with liver disease, including those with compensated cirrhosis. These medications may also improve and prevent alcoholic liver disease.
